Advanced Skills Teachers are judged through external assessment against a range of criteria to demonstrate excellent classroom teaching practice. They are employed in Advanced Skills Teacher posts in roles which include an element of work dedicated to supporting teaching colleagues in their own schools, and other schools in the area, to improve their own practice. The role was introduced in 1998 to reward excellent teachers who chose to stay working in classrooms, rather than following other routes to promotion through leadership.\n\nThe Labour party manifesto for the general election of 1997 included a statement that they would \"create a new grade of teachers to recognise the best.\" The intention was to ensure that teachers who excelled in the classroom were given both financial incentive and career-path options to allow them to continue in that role, providing a role model of high quality teaching.\n\nFollowing its election in May of that year, the new government brought forward the white paper, \"Excellence in Schools\", which outlined proposals for the new grade of teacher. The then Secretary of State for Education and Employment, David Blunkett, released additional details about the nature and pay relating to the posts in March 2008. In July of that year, regulations were put in place to provide funding for the role, with the grade being formally introduced from September 1998.\n\nAdvanced Skills Teachers (ASTs) are given additional non-teaching time to allow them to share their teaching skills with colleagues both within their own school, and in other schools in the local area. This time normally amounts to a minimum 20% of the working week. In this time, ASTs are expected to undertake a range of tasks related to the raising of standards of teaching and learning in classrooms. These include, although are not limited to:\nIt is expected that a considerable amount of this work will be undertaken in schools other than the teacher's own school as part of outreach schemes. This may involve working in liaison with the Local Education Authority.\n\nTo become an Advanced Skills Teacher, a qualified teacher must first be assessed as meeting the professional standards of the role. In addition, they must be appointed to a specially-created Advanced Skills Teacher post.\n\nIn order to be assessed as an AST, a teacher must demonstrate that they are able to meet the professional standards for the role. There are three stated standards relating to the role of AST, but in addition, applicants must also meet the subsumed standards of an Excellent teacher - a separate role as defined by government policy. There are a total of 28 standards to be met, falling under three main categories:\n\nTeachers applying for AST posts must meet an external assessor who will judge the postholder against the criteria before being appointed to the post.\n\nWhen the role of AST was first introduced, it was accompanied by a 27-point pay scale separate from that of classroom teachers or school managers. In its review of school teachers' pay in 2004, the School Teachers' Review Body recommended a change to the scale with effect from September 2006. Since that time, Advanced Skills Teachers have been paid on a scale of 18 pay points, which is identical to the first 18 points range of the Leadership pay scale, which is used for Head teachers, and Deputy and Assistant Headteachers.\n\nUnlike teachers employed on the main pay scale, Advanced Skills Teachers are not subject to the limits on working time of 195 days per academic year, or 1265 directed hours per year. Head teachers are, however, required to ensure that Advanced Skills Teachers have a reasonable work/life balance.\n\n"}

The book was scheduled for publication by Berkley Books in February 2009; its publication was canceled on December 27, 2008 when it was discovered that the book's central events were untrue.\n\nPrior to being exposed as a fabrication, the film rights to the book were purchased for $25 million by Harris Salomon of Atlantic Overseas Pictures. Other fans of the story included Oprah Winfrey who described it as the single greatest love story she had heard in 22 years of doing her show. In June 2010, Atlantic Overseas Pictures and producer Harris Salomon signed a co-production agreement with Castel Film Studios, the largest film studio in Central and Eastern Europe and the studio for \"Cold Mountain\" and \"Borat\", to produce a feature film on the Herman Rosenblat affair, based on an original screenplay by Ivo Marloh, to be shot in 2011.\n\nFabricated by Rosenblat, the story states that, beginning in the winter of 1944, a nine-year-old Jewish girl posing as a Christian from a local farm, met him at the electrified perimeter fence of the Schlieben concentration camp and tossed him an apple over the fence. She continued passing him food for seven months until he was transferred to another camp. According to Rosenblat, they met in 1957 on a blind date at Coney Island, New York, and, while relating their personal histories, discovered their shared past. Shortly afterwards, they married.\n\nSeveral Holocaust scholars including Deborah Lipstadt raised questions about “the central premise of his narrative — that a girl met him at the fence and that very girl became his wife,” and suggested that that premise \"is, at the very least, an embellishment, and at worst, a wholesale fabrication.\" According to an article published in the \"New Republic\", Professor Kenneth Waltzer, director of the Jewish Studies program at Michigan State University, stated that maps of Schlieben indicate that neither prisoners nor civilians could have approached the perimeter fence as one could only obtain access immediately next to the SS barracks. Waltzer also determined that Mr. Rosenblat's wife and her family were hidden as Christians at a farm near Breslau, 210 miles away from Schlieben. A number of researchers, including forensic genealogists Sharon Sergeant and Colleen Fitzpatrick, as well as several Holocaust survivors, worked with Waltzer in uncovering the deception and bringing it to the attention of reporters. Friends and family members also raised questions about the truth of statements in the book.\n\nRosenblat and the publisher, however, initially maintained that the story was truthful. Berkley Books subsequently stated that it was \"canceling publication of \"Angel at the Fence\" after receiving new information from Herman Rosenblat's agent, Andrea Hurst,\" and \"will demand that the author and the agent return all money that they have received for this work.\" Rosenblat, who was in fact imprisoned in Schlieben, has acknowledged that the story of meeting his wife there was invented.\n\nA children's version of the story, entitled Angel Girl (), written by Laurie Friedman and illustrated by Ofra Amit, was published in September 2008 by Carolrhoda Books of Lerner Publishing Group.\n\nA $25 million film adaptation of the book, titled \"Flower of the Fence\", was announced for production in spite of the cancellation of the story's publication. The film's intended producer, Harris Salomon of Atlantic Overseas Pictures, said the film would be a \"loose and fictionalised adaptation\" unaffected by issues with the memoir's authenticity. The film, however, was never made.\n\nIn August 2009, York House Press published a paperback by Penelope Holt titled \"The Apple: Based on the Herman Rosenblat Holocaust Love Story\" ().\n\n\n"}

The trio, who were known as \"“The McNulty Family’s Irish Showboat Revue”\", first appeared on stage as such in 1932-1933 and through Ma’s astute show business acumen became almost immediately and remained for decades an astounding success on the U.S. East Coast entertainment circuit. The trio eventually appeared regularly on radio and at such venues as the Rockefeller Center's Radio City Music Hall, the Yorkville Casino, New York City’s Leitrim House and at Rockaway Beach, Queens. For 16 consecutive years the trio of \"Ma\" McNulty, Eileen McNulty and Peter McNulty sold out the Brooklyn Academy of Music’s 2,109 seat Howard Gillman Opera House. In their near 2 decades of music recording for labels like Decca Records, Standard and Copley from 1938-1956, the McNulty family’s \"“Showboat Revue”\" released 155 sides on 78-rpm shellac & vinyl. In 1953, they appeared through the then new entertainment venue of television on Milton Berle’s wildly popular Texaco Star Theater.\n\n“Ma” McNulty did not appear on stage during her children's earlier duo performances. In 1926, after one theater’s “professor” was unable to keep proper time for her children, “Ma” began, herself, keeping time for them from backstage on an old melodeon accordion. By 1928, she had been encouraged to perform on stage with her children. Though by the late 1930s, radio and motion pictures had already there and throughout the nation eclipsed as popular entertainment vaudeville, which had begun in the 1880s, the McNulty family managed to keep the art of Irish “vaudevillian” or variety theater alive on the U.S. East Coast well into the 1950s. The McNulty family had a powerful influence on the development of the Music of Newfoundland and Labrador in its modern era. Another testament to the popularity of the McNulty Family was the impressive number of recordings they made for Decca, Standard, and Copley: 155 sides on 78-rpm releases.\n\n\nMusic of Newfoundland and Labrador\n"}

{"id": "23699123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23699123", "title": "Bigipedia", "text": "Bigipedia\n\nBigipedia is a comedy sketch show broadcast on BBC Radio 4 that first aired between 23 July and 13 August 2009. A second series of four episodes began on 12 July 2011. The show's storyline revolves around \"Bigipedia\", a fictional website broadcast on radio and parody of Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia. The series mocks Wikipedia and other aspects of the Internet. The BBC Press Office described the show as \"a unique experiment in 'broadwebcasting'\". The series was created by co-star Nick Doody, who also co-writes the show with Matt Kirshen and a wider team of writers. It is produced by Pozzitive Productions.\n\nCritics have given \"Bigipedia\" positive reviews. The series was marketed by the BBC as \"\"The Sunday Format\" for the online age\", and critics have given \"Bigipedia\" favourable comparisons with its predecessor. The quality of the writing has also been praised. However, a few critics have expressed reservations about the way the show is presented. The first series of \"Bigipedia\" was made available to purchase as a download from Audible.co.uk from 1 December 2009. The second series was made available on AudioGo from 5 December 2011.\n\n\"Bigipedia\" is a website broadcast on the radio. Like Wikipedia, it contains articles and discussion pages about a range of different subjects, which can be edited by anyone. Among the similarities are , , , , a news section and a \"\" section for new articles. The articles cover a range of fictional celebrities, bands, films, television series, products and a running gag series of articles on anthropomorphic animal characters from Uruguayan safety campaigns.\n\n\"Bigipedia\" differs from Wikipedia in some ways. For example, \"Bigipedia\" includes puzzles and competitions, sells its own software, has a range of screensavers, and a section for children called \"Bigikids\", which has had different names in the past which have all had to be changed for different reasons. For example, the name changed from \"Kidipedia\" \"due to a misunderstanding\", \"Hanging at the School Gates\" \"for reasons you may have seen in the news\" and \"Underage Fun\" \"due to a copyright infringement\".\n\nAlso, while Wikipedia does not have , \"Bigipedia\" does and is also sponsored by a fictional wine-like drink called \"Chianto\" which is referred to as \"this horrific drink\". The \"Bigipedia\" article on Chianto says: \"Over the years it has been sold as a hair remover, self-defence spray, hair restorer, and to farmers as a humane way of killing chickens – by putting it into the pig's feed and leaving the gate open. By morning not only were the chickens killed, but often plucked, too.\"\n\nThe first series ended with \"Bigipedia\" attempting to take over the world, having crushed a rebellion in the Philippines and feeding nanobots into the heads of anyone listening to the programme. At the start of the second series, \"Bigipedia\" acknowledges that the original \"Bigipedia\", dubbed \"Bigipedia 1.0\" suffered from \"security and sentient omniscience issues\" and apologises for, \"the temporary cyber enslavement of 88% of mankind and the forming of a \"BigiHuman\" hybrid hivemind centred in the Philippines\", in an incident they refer to as \"The Glitch\". The site has been updated and is now known as \"Bigipedia 2.0\".\n\nThe second series begins with reports of a gigantic Chianto slick in the Gulf of Mexico, a parody of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. At the end of the series, a mix of white and red Chianto in the slick result in the creation of a Chianto \"ovum\", which hatches at the bottom of the sea as a monstrous party-animal being called the Chianto Leviathan, which makes its way to the \"Bigipedia\" servers in Mexico. The Leviathan attempts to gain all the world's knowledge by accessing the system. The programme ends with \"Bigipedia\" playing \"prerecorded programmes\" while they attempt to stop the Leviathan.\n\nThe series was originally conceived by Doody, who was working with producer David Tyler on another BBC Radio 4 comedy series, \"Armando Iannucci's Charm Offensive\". Doody attended a meeting where people were discussing new ideas for radio shows, and Kirshen suggested the idea, and both he and Kirshen wrote the full proposal. Radio 4 liked the idea and a pilot was made. Tyler went on to produce and direct \"Bigipedia\".\n\nDoody and Kirshen describe the show as \"writing-heavy\". Doody said in an interview with the British Comedy Guide: \"Compared to most radio shows, it's incredibly dense, material-wise, and very fast-moving. I think Matt and I would like some of it to be even faster, but sometimes people who've heard the pilot say things like, \"It's almost too much.\" I really like that. I like that it's something you kind of need to hear twice to catch everything. When we got the series, I honestly didn't know where we'd come up with the material of the quality we were determined to keep up.\"\n\nSome of the sketches in \"Bigipedia\" are inspired directly by articles on Wikipedia. Kirshen said in the same interview: \"There's a 'Bee Whisperer' in Episode 3 that came from clicking the \"Random article\" link on Wikipedia. I don't remember what the page we got was, but about three logical leaps later we landed on that idea.\"\n\nIt was revealed by Doody on his \"Doubling Up\" podcast with Rob Heeney that there was an extended edition of \"The Line\" sketch, which he broadcast on the show.\n\nThe reviews of \"Bigipedia\" have been mainly positive. Before the series began, Scott Matthewman in \"The Stage\" compared \"Bigipedia\" to \"The Sunday Format\", saying: \"Indeed, the comparison even makes it into the BBC's own press notes. Will this version, which takes the mickey out of online communication, deserve the comparison? That's something we'll have to wait and see.\" Chris Maume in \"The Independent on Sunday\" also commented that there are references to \"Spinal Tap\", \"On the Hour\" and \"Brass Eye\".\n\nElisabeth Mahoney in \"The Guardian\" said that she liked the Chianto running gag, while Gillian Reynolds from the \"Daily Telegraph\" commented positively on \"Bigipedia\" saying it was, \"the first late-night comedy in ages that has made me laugh, about computers and why I'm scared of them, about vile TV shows and meaningless commercials. Written by Nick Doody and Matt Kirshen, performed with zest by a sparkling cast. Bound to become a cult.\" Reviewing the second series Elizabeth Day in \"The Observer\" described \"Bigipedia\" as, \"a hilariously mad portrayal of information overload in the computer age.\"\n\nClare Heal in the \"Sunday Express\" gave a mixed review, saying that while she found it amusing, it was too similar to the Internet saying, \"The programme's only failing was that on occasion it was a little to [sic] reminiscent of the real Internet, ie a virtual ocean full of morons willing to shout loudly about things even (or perhaps especially) if they know nothing about them. You wouldn't want more than half an hour of \"Bigipedia\", no matter how amusing it is.\"\n\n"}

The valley has a number of Buddhist reliefs and sculptures, the best known of which is the Shakhorai Buddha.\n\nThe Swat Valley contained a large number of monasteries, forming a sacred landscape where images, sculptures and inscriptions welcomed pilgrims as they entered the valley. Some scholars believe that the valley is the site of Oddiyana, a small medieval kingdom that played a crucial role in the development and dissemination of Vajrayana Buddhism, and the homeland of the sages Indrabhūti and Padmasambhava.\n\nAs one enters the sub-valley of Manglawar its importance is immediately revealed with the huge and well known rock relief of the Shakhorai Buddha. The importance of sub-valley Manglawar can be judged from the accounts of Sir. Aural Stein, he says:\nThis valley has much potential of Buddhist sacred areas, inscriptions and rock reliefs. Four areas were most of reliefs are concentrated have already been reported, among them are:\n\nThis valley has a great potential for archeological antiquities and shows a number of Buddhist sacred areas.

It was led by a Chechen commander Shamil Basayev until his death in July 2006 and since then by an ethnic Ingush Akhmed Yevloyev. Yevloyev was captured alive in June 2010. In October 2007 the Caucasian Front was subsumed into the Caucasus Emirate, a self declared Islamic State that claims the North Caucasus of Russia.\n\nWhile the anti-Russian local insurgencies in North Caucasus started even before the formal creation of the Caucasian Front, two months after Aslan Maskhadov's death, the new Chechen separatist leader Abdul-Halim Sadulayev officially announced that they had formed a Caucasus Front within the framework of \"reforming the system of military-political power.\" Along with the existing Chechen, Dagestani and Ingush \"sectors\", the Stavropol, Kabardin-Balkar, Krasnodar, Karachai-Circassian, Ossetian and Adyghe jamaats were included in it, meaning that in theory most the regions of the south-west Russia's would be involved in hostilities. In October 2006, Dokku Umarov established two new fronts beyond the North Caucasus region – the Volga and the Ural fronts. The Chechen separatist movement had taken on a new role as the official ideological, logistical and, probably, financial hub of the new insurgency in the North Caucasus. Increasingly frequent clashes between federal forces and local rebels continue in Dagestan and Ingushetia, while sporadic fighting erupts in the other southern Russia regions. Before the declaration of the Caucasus Emirate, the movement had conducted two-large scale attacks, the 2004 Nazran raid in Ingushetia (before the formal proclamation) and the 2005 Nalchik raid in Kabardino-Balkaria. The movement also launched many smaller attacks such as the 2006 Avtury ambush & 2007 Zhani-Vedeno ambush.\n\n"}
{"id": "3099616", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3099616", "title": "Coins of Lundy", "text": "Coins of Lundy\n\nThe coins of Lundy are two unofficial issues of currency from the island of Lundy, in the Bristol Channel off the west coast of England. In 1969 Jack Hayward, a British millionaire, purchased the island for £150,000 and gave it to the British people.\n\nThe first issue was issued in 1929 by the self-declared 'King of Lundy', Martin Coles Harman, who was an English businessman, born 1885, Steyning, Sussex, who bought Lundy in 1925. There were two coins – the Half Puffin and the One Puffin, which were rated at the same nominal value as the British halfpenny and penny. The obverse of the coins depict a portrait facing left with 'MARTIN.COLES.HARMAN'. The edges of the coins are lettered with the inscription 'LUNDY LIGHTS AND LEADS', a reference to the island's two lighthouses. The reverse of the Half Puffin coin depicts a puffin's head; half a Puffin. The reverse of the One Puffin coin depicts a puffin facing left on a rocky ledge. The unfussy and strong design of the coins is regarded as more than competent with significant modernist touches which foresee the high 1930s design school. The currency was called the puffin because the islanders had a long history of bartering puffin feathers for food and other commodities. The coins were made of bronze, and landed Harman in trouble with the British authorities in 1930 for unauthorised minting of money.\n\nVisitors from the island could exchange any remaining 'puffins' at the banks in Bideford, who then returned the Lundy coins to the island (Coin News 1999). The coins were struck in Birmingham by Ralph Heaton's Mint, Birmingham Ltd. The currency saw real, if limited use. Martin Coles Harman died in 1954.\n\n50,000 bronze tokens about the size of a penny were minted by Ralph Heaton & Sons, Birmingham in 1929, together with a similar number of articles about the size of a half-penny. The price was 50/9 per 1000 for the larger and 26/6 for the smaller, and there was a £100 fee for preparing the design and sinking the dies.\n\nBronze pattern coins of the 1929 issue exist with a thicker flange and the lack of an edge inscription. The details on the obverse and reverse also differ slightly. The coins remain highly collectible to this day.\n\nHarman had sent specimen coins to the Royal Mint and had been thanked for them, although they had warned him about Section 5 of the Coinage Act of 1870. Harman replied that Lundy was \"a little Kingdom in the British Empire, but out of England.\" He recognised King George V as the head of state, however he was adamant that Lundy was a self-governing dominion within the British Empire. This led to a visit from the Devon Constabulary and a Supt. Bolt and other officers reported seeing the coins (tokens) in use at the Marisco Tavern, mixed with standard British Imperial coinage. Harman lost his case at the Petty Sessions in Bideford and appealed to the High Court of Justice where he also lost and was fined £5, with fifteen guineas (£15 15s) costs.\n\nSir Hugh N. Grenville Stucley was the presiding magistrate at the Petty Sessional Division court which tried the case of Supt. Bolt on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions v. Martin Coles Harman, charged with on the 5th day of March, 1930, in the Island of Lundy in the County of Devon, did unlawfully as a token for money issue a piece of metal to the value of one half-penny, contrary to Section 5 of the Coinage Act of 1870.\n\nThe appeal trial was held on 13 January 1931 at the King's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice, in London, and, it was hoped at the time, would settle the status of Lundy once and for all. It didn't – but it did show how utterly confused the situation was. In his defence, Mr Harman said he had every right to mint money, for Lundy, in his words, was \"a vest-pocket-size, self-governing dominion,\" out of the realm for every practical purpose. The Lundy residents, he pointed out, never had paid any taxes to England and were liable to customs when they went there, for Lundy itself was a free port. The Attorney General, who was prosecuting Mr Harman, said that Lundy was surely a Utopia but that its inhabitants would be just as happy if the face of King George V, rather than of Mr Harman, were depicted on the place's currency. (Mr Harman's face was on the front of the coins, and that of a puffin on the back. There were two denominations, a one-puffin coin and a half-puffin coin, neatly convertible to a penny and a ha'penny at the legal rate of exchange.)\n\nIn 1965, a second issue of coins, made by John Pinches, was carried out. These were a to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Martin Coles Harman's purchase of Lundy. The coins are of the same design as the 1929 issue coins, but have plain edges and the 1965 date. They were struck in Proof sets, in bronze, nickel-brass, and gold. They were issued in a special case of which at least two varieties exist. 3000 of the base metal sets were issued and 25 of the gold sets. Apart from the sets, 25 each of the proof gold denominations were also issued for presentation purposes. It has been reported that Lundy puffin forgeries may exist. This seems unlikely and it may be that confusion with the 'pattern coins' or between the 1929 and 1965 issues has resulted in an erroneous interpretation. Unlike the 1929 issues, which did circulate, these are generally not considered numismatic items.\n\nIn 1977 Queen Elizabeth II visited Lundy Island as part of the celebrations of her Silver Jubilee. 1,977 Puffin and half Puffin proof grade copper tokens have been produced bearing this date. The designs are very similar if not identical to the 1929 and 1965 issues, however they do not carry the edge inscription. It is not clear when they were minted as they only came on to the numismatic market in 2014.\n\nA set of five 'fantasy' Lundy coins were put on sale in 2011. These five coins are dated 2011 and are in the Puffin denominations: half, one, two, four and six P. This set is distinct since only half and one puffin coins had been issued in the past. They carry the same edge inscription as the original 1929 coins, though the inscription is incuse rather than raised and a similar, less boldly engraved portrait of Martin Coles Harman. The half and one P are copper plated brass, the two and four are in a brass and the six P is copper nickel. The half and one puffin coins are smaller in size. The 1929 & 1965 puffin is 29.29mm whilst the 2011 puffin is 27.3mm. The half puffins are nearly identical in size. The two P has two puffins flying, the four P a Lundy lighthouse, and the six P has Tresco Castle on the reverse. The six P coin has a reeded edge and is crown size. The quality of these coins is quite high.\n\nAnother possible coinage connection exists through the activities of one Thomas Bushell, friend of Francis Bacon, a strong supporter of the Royalist cause during the First English Civil War and an expert on mining and coining. It has been argued that during his stay on Lundy he produced coinage for King Charles I, however definitive proof has not been found and it remains speculation. He held Lundy for the King and this was the last part of the king's lands to capitulate to the victorious Parliamentary forces after a siege lasting a year.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2165190", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2165190", "title": "Columbia (name)", "text": "Columbia (name)\n\nColumbia (; ) is the personification of the United States. It was also a historical name used by some Europeans and Americans to describe the Americas, the New World. It is also a name given to the \"Spirit of the Frontier\", used to illustrate manifest destiny, among several other American political causes. It has given rise to the names of many persons, places, objects, institutions and companies; for example: Columbia University, the District of Columbia (the national capital of the United States), and the ship \"Columbia Rediviva\", which would give its name to the Columbia River. Images of the Statue of Liberty largely displaced personified Columbia as the female symbol of the United States by around 1920, although Lady Liberty was seen as an aspect of Columbia. The District of Columbia is named after the personification, as is the traditional patriotic hymn \"Hail Columbia\", which is the official vice presidential anthem of the United States Vice President.\n\nColumbia is a New Latin toponym in use since the 1730s for the Thirteen Colonies. It originated from the name of Italian explorer Christopher Columbus and from the ending \"-ia\", common in Latin names of countries (paralleling Britannia, Gallia, and others).\n\nMassachusetts Chief Justice Samuel Sewall used the name Columbina (not Columbia) for the New World in 1697. The name Columbia for America first appeared in 1738 in the weekly publication of the debates of the British Parliament in Edward Cave's \"The Gentleman's Magazine\". Publication of Parliamentary debates was technically illegal, so the debates were issued under the thin disguise of \"Reports of the Debates of the Senate of Lilliput\" and fictitious names were used for most individuals and placenames found in the record. Most of these were transparent anagrams or similar distortions of the real names and some few were taken directly from Jonathan Swift's \"Gulliver's Travels while\" a few others were classical or neoclassical in style. Such were Ierne for Ireland, Iberia for Spain, Noveborac for New York (from Eboracum, the Roman name for York) and Columbia for America—at the time used in the sense of \"European colonies in the New World\".\n\nThe name was perhaps first coined by Samuel Johnson, thought to have been the author of an introductory essay (in which Columbia already appears) which explained the conceit of substituting Lilliputian for English names; Johnson also wrote down the \"Debates\" from 1740 to 1743. The name continued to appear in \"The Gentleman's Magazine\" until December 1746. Columbia seems an obvious calque on America, substituting the base of the surname of the discoverer Christopher Columbus for the base of the given name of the somewhat less well-known Amerigo Vespucci. As the debates of Parliament, many of whose decisions directly affected the colonies, were distributed and closely followed in the British colonies in America, the name Columbia would have been familiar to the United States' founding generation.\n\nIn the second half of the 18th century, the American colonists were creating their own identity distinct from that of their British cousins. At that time, it was common for European countries to use a Latin name in formal or poetical contexts to confer an additional degree of respectability on the country concerned. In many cases, these nations were personified as pseudo-classical goddesses named with these Latin names. Located on a continent unknown to and unnamed by the Romans, Columbia was the closest that the Americans could come to emulating this custom.\n\nBy the time of the Revolution, the name Columbia had lost the comic overtone of its Lilliputian origins and had become established as an alternative, or poetic name for America. While the name America is necessarily scanned with four syllables, according to 18th-century rules of English versification Columbia was normally scanned with three, which is often more metrically convenient. For instance, the name appears in a collection of complimentary poems written by Harvard graduates in 1761 on the occasion of the marriage and coronation of King George III.\n\nThe name Columbia rapidly came to be applied to a variety of items reflecting American identity. A ship built in Massachusetts in 1773 received the name \"Columbia Rediviva\" and it later became famous as an exploring ship and lent its name to new Columbias.\n\nNo serious consideration was given to using the name Columbia as an official name for the independent United States, but with independence the name became popular and was given to many counties, townships, and towns as well as other institutions.\nIn part, the more frequent usage of the name Columbia reflected a rising American neoclassicism, exemplified in the tendency to use Roman terms and symbols. The selection of the eagle as the national bird, the heraldric use of the eagle, the use of the term Senate to describe the upper house of Congress and the naming of Capitol Hill and the Capitol building were all conscious evocations of Roman precedents.\n\nThe adjective Columbian has been used to mean \"of or from the United States of America\", for instance in the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition held in Chicago, Illinois. It has occasionally been proposed as an alternative word for American.\n\nColumbian should not be confused with the adjective pre-Columbian, referring to a time period before the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492.\n\nAs a quasi-mythical figure, Columbia first appears in the poetry of African-American Phillis Wheatley starting in 1776 during the revolutionary war.\n<poem>\n</poem>\n\nEspecially in the 19th century, Columbia was visualized as a goddess-like female national personification of the United States and of liberty itself, comparable to the British Britannia, the Italian Italia Turrita and the French Marianne, often seen in political cartoons of the 19th and early 20th century. This personification was sometimes called Lady Columbia or Miss Columbia. Such iconography usually personified America in the form of an Indian queen or Native American princess.\nThe image of the personified Columbia was never fixed, but she was most often presented as a woman between youth and middle age, wearing classically-draped garments decorated with stars and stripes. A popular version gave her a red-and-white-striped dress and a blue blouse, shawl, or sash, spangled with white stars. Her headdress varied and sometimes it included feathers reminiscent of a Native American headdress while other times it was a laurel wreath, but most often it was a cap of liberty.\nEarly in World War I (1914–1918) the image of Columbia standing over a kneeling \"Doughboy\" was issued in lieu of the Purple Heart Medal. She gave \"to her son the accolade of the new chivalry of humanity\" for injuries sustained in \"the\" World War.\nIn World War I, the name Liberty Bond for savings bonds was heavily publicized, often with images from the Statue of Liberty. The personification of Columbia fell out of use and she was largely replaced by the Statue of Liberty as a feminine symbol of the United States. When Columbia Pictures adopted Columbia as its logo in 1924, she appeared (and still appears) bearing a torch—similar to the Statue of Liberty and unlike 19th-century depictions of Columbia.\n\nStatues of the personified Columbia may be found among others in the following places.\n\nSince 1800, the name Columbia has been used for a wide variety of items.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11522564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11522564", "title": "Conceptual physics", "text": "Conceptual physics\n\nConceptual physics is an approach to teaching physics that focuses on the ideas of physics rather than the often daunting mathematics. It is believed that with a strong conceptual foundation in physics, students are better equipped to understand the equations and formulas of physics, and to make connections between the concepts of physics and their everyday life. Early versions used almost no equations or math-based problems.\n\nPaul G. Hewitt popularized this approach with his textbook \"Conceptual Physics: A New Introduction to your Environment\" in 1971. In his review at the time, Kenneth Ford noted the emphasis on logical reasoning and said \"Hewitt's excellent book can be called physics without equations, or physics without computation, but not physics without mathematics.\" Hewitt's wasn't the first book to take this approach. \"Conceptual Physics: Matter in Motion\" by Jae R. Ballif and William E. Dibble was published in 1969. But Hewitt's book became very successful. As of 2014 it is in its twelfth edition. In 1987 Hewitt wrote a version for high school students.\n\nThe spread of the conceptual approach to teaching physics broadened the range of students taking physics in high school. Enrollment in conceptual physics courses in high school grew from 25,000 students in 1987 to over 400,000 in 2009. In 2009, 37% of students took high school physics, and 31% of them were in Physics First, conceptual physics courses, or regular physics courses using a conceptual textbook.\n\nThis approach to teaching physics has also inspired books for science literacy courses, such as \"From Atoms to Galaxies: A Conceptual Physics Approach to Scientific Awareness\" by Sadri Hassani.\n"}

{"id": "13476264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13476264", "title": "Contract grading", "text": "Contract grading\n\nContract grading is a form of grading which results from cooperation between an instructor and his or her student, and entails contracted number of assignments of specified quality that correspond to specific letter grades. Contract grading may be contrasted with other grading methods, such as grading on a curve or percentile systems.\n\nIn traditional grading, educators determine assignments, exams, and projects before the course begins. Students are expected to follow the syllabus and complete the tasks presented. The grade the student receives is a reflection of how well he or she completed the pre-determined syllabus. In this system, students are expected to follow a path that reflects the syllabus.\n\nHowever, the contract grading system allows each student to make his or her own path for the class, which allows students to pick and choose which assignments or projects they want to complete. Grades are assigned on the basis of the agreement between the student and the professor. With contract grading, students have a say in their curriculum, as well as how their grade is ultimately assessed. For some students this grading system requires a more active role.\n\nAlthough the student decides what is to be accomplished throughout the course, similar to a contract, both the student and professor must come to an agreement. After students turn in their initial contract or proposal, the teacher may make revisions or require some changes be made before a final agreement is made. Similar to a contract, a contract grade must also be signed by both parties, confirming the agreement for a particular grade. However, the contract grading system is not as binding as a business contract. Should the student change his or her mind mid-semester, he or she may re-submit the contract provided the professor approves the changes.\n\nDr. Scott Alberts, professor at Truman State University, has implemented contract grading in a few of the courses he teaches, including his Junior Interdisciplinary Seminar class and Introductory Interdisciplinary class. While students have the freedom to choose which assignments they will complete, Dr. Alberts does implement some constraints. The contract used in his course consists of both required components, as well as optional components. The required number of additional \"optional\" assignments for each letter grade is also clearly established.\n\nFor example, students must earn at least 10 +'s on required and optional assignments in order to receive an A in the class. Therefore, students are able to decide what letter grade they wish to receive in the course and accordingly complete the additional, optional assignments that may warrant a certain number of +'s leading them toward their desired grade. That quality is also an intrinsic part of Dr. Alberts’ contract system because quantity alone cannot achieve the grade. Students, in addition to choosing the grade they desire and how many assignments they will complete, must also commit themselves to the completion of their contract. Once the student determines the number of works he or she chooses to complete, contracts are then signed and agreed upon. There is a grace period for changing of contracts, but it is ultimately up to the professor to accept or to reject any proposals. The student then has the responsibility to complete and turn in the contracted assignments, with a few deadlines to meet.\n\nA study published in 1990 received opinions about the contract grading system from 51 undergraduate education majors and 28 graduate students majoring in education at Acadia University in Nova Scotia, Canada. Students at both education levels reacted to the contract grading system in a positive manner. They agreed that the grading system and assignments were made clear from the beginning, that the system was appropriate, and that grades were assigned fairly. When asked to rank the effectiveness and importance of the various aspects of contract grading, students reported that the key elements were the control they felt they had by being able to determine their grades, the clearly stated expectations for performance in the course, criterion referencing of assignments, and the mastery approach to learning.\n\nContract grading can enable the student to progress at his or her own pace. In addition to placing time management more fully in the hands of the student, contract grading can also emphasize learning and reduce grade competition. Systems of this style also encourage a cooperative learning process. By requiring instructor and student to work jointly, emphasis is added on the desires of the student and the goals he or she wishes to accomplish. According to Bucknell University, contract grading \"facilitates the development of a partnership learning environment in which students are likely to retain more information, make better use of information, and be more highly motivated to learn than in teacher-directed learning environments.\" Due to the freedom allowed by the system, time management skills are acquired and exercised.\n\nContract grading could be viewed as threatening to students who have relied upon structured grading processes. Increased responsibility may cause anxiety for students expecting more common approaches. In addition to concerns for the individual student, contract grading is largely dependent upon implementation by the instructor. An instructor may, through this grading system, cause students to take on greater responsibility for learning and success while simultaneously restricting freedom. Contract grading systems are susceptible to paternalism on the part of the instructor. Whereas the students take on the responsibility of choosing assignments, they may not also actively determine expectations.\n"}

{"id": "140864", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=140864", "title": "Duplicating machines", "text": "Duplicating machines\n\nDuplicating machines were the predecessors of modern document-reproduction technology. They have now been replaced by digital duplicators, scanners, laser printers and photocopiers, but for many years they were the primary means of reproducing documents for limited-run distribution.\n\nLike the typewriter, these machines were products of the second phase of the industrial revolution which started near the end of the 19th century (also called the Second Industrial Revolution). This second phase brought to mass markets technologies like the small electric motors and the products of industrial chemistry without which the duplicating machines would not have been economical. By bringing greatly increased quantities of paperwork to daily life, the duplicating machine and the typewriter gradually changed the forms of the office desk and transformed the nature of office work.\n\nThey were often used in schools, churches, and small organizations, where revolutionarily economical copying was in demand for the production of newsletters and worksheets. Self-publishers also used these machines to produce fanzines.\nA few alternatives to hand copying were invented between the mid-17th century and the late 18th century, but none had a significant impact in offices.\n\nIn document duplication (as opposed to law enforcement and such), a Polygraph is a mechanical device that moves a second pen parallel to one held by a writer, enabling the writer to make a duplicate of a document as it is written. Polygraphs appeared in the 17th century but did not become popular until 1800. Hawkins & Peale patented a polygraph in the US in 1803, and beginning in 1804 Thomas Jefferson collaborated with them in working on improvements in the machine. He used a polygraph for the rest of his life. However, polygraphs were not practical for most office purposes and were never widely used in businesses. Hawkins & Peale lost money producing polygraphs. The problem was their \"inherent instability, and constant need for repair and adjustment.\"\n\nIn 1780 James Watt obtained a patent for letter copying presses, which James Watt & Co. produced beginning in that year. Letter copying presses were used by the early 1780s by the likes of Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, Henry Cavendish, and Thomas Jefferson. In 1785, Jefferson was using both stationary and portable presses made by James Watt & Co.\n\nUsing letter copying presses, copies could be made up to twenty-four hours after a letter was written, though copies made within a few hours were best. A copying clerk would begin by counting the number of master letters to be written during the next few hours and by preparing the copying book. Suppose the clerk wanted to copy 20 one-page letters. In that case, he would insert a sheet of oiled paper into the copying book in front of the first tissue on which he wanted to make a copy of a letter. He would then turn 20 sheets of tissue paper and insert a second oiled paper. To dampen the tissue paper, the clerk used a brush or copying paper damper. The damper had a reservoir for water that wet a cloth, and the clerk wiped the cloth over the tissues on which copies were to be made. As an alternative method of dampening the tissue paper, in 1860 Cutter, Tower & Co., Boston, advertised Lynch's patent paper moistener.\n\nThen letters were written with special copying ink which was not blotted. The copying clerk arranged the portion of the letter book to be used in the following sequence starting from the front: a sheet of oiled paper, then a sheet of letter book tissue, then a letter placed face up against the back of the tissue on which the copy was to be made, then another oiled paper, etc.\n\nPrior to the introduction of inks made with aniline dyes in 1856, the quality of copies made on letter copying presses was limited by the properties of the available copying inks. Some documents that were to be copied with copying presses were written with copying pencils rather than copying ink. The cores of copying pencils, which appear to have been introduced in the 1870s, were made from a mixture of graphite, clay, and aniline dye.\n\nBy the late 1870s, an improved method for moistening pages in copying books had been invented, and by the late 1880s it had been widely adopted. Rather than using a brush or damper to wet the tissues, the clerk inserted a thin moist cloth or pad between each oil paper and the following tissue.\n\nIn the late 1880s, adoption of improvements in office systems for filing unbound documents increased the demand for copying machines that made unbound copies of letters, as opposed to copies in bound books. In 1886, Schlicht & Field of Rochester, N.Y., introduced the Rapid Roller Damp-Leaf Copier, a roller copier, which used pressure supplied by rollers to copy letters onto a roll of dampened paper. After copies were pressed onto the paper, the paper entered the cabinet under the copier, where it dried on a large roller. An attachment was used to cut dried copies off the roll.\n\nCopies could be made more quickly with a roller copier than with a letter copying press. It was claimed that nearly 100 papers could be copied in two minutes with a roller copier. Roller copiers competed with carbon paper technology. It was claimed that a roller copier could make a half dozen copies of a typewritten letter if the letter was run through the copier several times. It could make a dozen copies if the letter was written with a pen and good copying ink.\n\nThe Process Letter Machine Co. of Muncie, Indiana, offered the New Rotary Copying Press, a loose-leaf copier, in 1902. This machine was similar to roller copiers but copied onto loose-leaf paper.\n\nThe hectograph introduced in 1876 or shortly before, was a technology in which a dye-impregnated master copy, not unlike a ditto master, was laid on top of a cake pan full of firm gelatin. After the dye soaked into the gelatin, sheets of paper could be laid on top of the gelatin to transfer the image. This was good for 50 copies at most. Hectography was slow and clunky, but it could inspire great intrepidity in its users.\n\nWhile good-quality, reasonably rapid copies from a hectograph require fairly specific materials (Aniline dye is the most effective), passable copies can be produced from a bewildering array of improvised materials on makeshift equipment. Practically speaking, any dye that soaks into the gelatin and can then be drawn out by the available paper will work. This meant that improvised hectography assumed the role of reproducing nearly every sort of censored material from subversive literature to pornography. \n\nThe mimeo machine (mimeograph) invented by Albert Blake Dick in 1884 used heavy waxed-paper \"stencils\" that a pen or a typewriter could cut through. The stencil was wrapped around the drum of the (manual or electrical) machine, which forced ink out through the cut marks on the stencil. The paper had a surface texture (like bond paper), and the ink was black and odorless. A person could use special knives to cut stencils by hand, but handwriting was impractical, because any closed loop letterform would cut a hole and thus print as a black blob. The technology was soon refined to control this problem, also allowing the use of typewriters to prepare mimeograph masters. If the user put the stencil on the drum wrong-side-out, the copies came out mirror-imaged.\n\nThe ditto machine (spirit duplicator) sold by Ditto, Inc., used two-ply \"spirit masters\" or \"ditto masters\". The top sheet could be typed, drawn, or written upon. The second sheet was coated with a layer of colored wax. The pressure of writing or typing on the top sheet transferred colored wax to its back side, producing a mirror image of the desired marks. (This acted like a reverse of carbon paper.) The wax-supply sheet was then removed and discarded, and the other sheet (containing the images) was fastened onto the drum of the (manual or electrical) machine, with the waxed (back, or reverse-image) side out.\n\nThe usual wax color was aniline purple, a cheap, moderately durable pigment that provided good contrast, though other colors were also available. Unlike mimeo, ditto had the useful ability to print multiple colors in a single pass, which made it popular with cartoonists. Spirit duplicators were incapable of double-sided printing, since the saturation of the paper with solvent inherent to the process would destroy a previously printed image. One well-made ditto master could at most print about 500 copies, far fewer than a mimeo stencil could manage. To produce further copies, an entirely new master would have to be reconstructed in the same way as the original master.\n\nNotoriously, dittoed images would gradually fade with exposure to light, limiting their usability for permanent labels and signage. Dittoed copies now pose a serious challenge to archivists responsible for document textual and artistic preservation.\n\nDitto machines and mimeograph machines were competing and complementary technologies during the first half of the 20th century. Mimeography was in general a more forgiving technology, and still survives in various forms into the 21st century.\n\nDitto machines required much finer operating tolerances and careful adjustments to operate correctly. Overall print quality of spirit duplicators was frequently poor, though a capable operator could overcome this with careful adjustment of feed rate, pressure, and solvent volume.\n\nDuring their heyday, tabletop duplicators of both sorts were the inexpensive and convenient alternatives to conventional typesetting and offset or letterpress printing. They were well suited for the short runs used for school worksheets, church newsletters, and apazines. Even the least technically minded teachers, professors, clergy, and self-publishers could make use of them. The machines owed most of their popularity to this relative ease of use, and in some cases, to their lack of a requirement for an external power source.\n\nMimeograph machines predated the spirit duplicator, had a lower cost per impression, superior print quality, finer resolution, and if properly adjusted could be used for multi-pass and double-sided printing. Also, mimeographed images were as durable as the paper they were printed on, and didn't bleach to illegibility if exposed to sunlight, the way that dittoed pages did. A good mimeo master could produce many more copies than the best ditto master. As with ditto masters, mimeo stencils could be saved and reused for later print jobs.\n\nThere are still mimeography enthusiasts in the United States and Canada, and mimeo technology is still in everyday use in the Third World, since many low-cost mimeograph machines do not require electricity to operate.\n\nIn the United States, an offset press with a sheet size smaller than is classified as a duplicator. In Europe, the distinction is made between presses that have cylinder bearings, and duplicators, which do not. Duplicators were manufactured by Heidelberg (T-offset), American Type Founders (Chief and Davidson lines), A.B. Dick Company, and Addressograph-Mulitilith.\n\nIn 1986, the RISO Kagaku Corporation introduced the digital duplicator. It uses the basic mimeograph technology but improves on it, in that the operator does not have to create the stencil directly. The stencil, called a master, is made by use of a scanner and thermal print head. A used master is automatically removed and placed in a disposal box, as a new one is created. This way the operator should not have to touch the used master material that is coated in ink.\n\nThere are also cost advantages over a copier at higher volume. For smaller print runs, the main cost is in the master material. This ranges between 40 – 80 cents per master depending on the manufacturer. When spread over 20 or more copies, the cost per copy (2 to 4 cents) is close to photocopiers. But for every additional copy, the average cost decreases. At 100 prints, the master cost per copy was only 0.4–0.8 cents per copy, and the cost of the paper printed upon will start to dominate. A master is capable of making 4000–5000 prints, and then a new master easily be made if needed for further copies.\n\nOther manufacturers have adapted the technology including:\n\nLike the mimeo machine, digital duplicators have a stencil (called a master), ink, and drum—but the process is all automated.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1151889", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1151889", "title": "Durga Puja", "text": "Durga Puja\n\nDurga Puja, also called Durgotsava, is an annual Hindu festival in the Indian subcontinent that reveres the goddess Durga. It is particularly popular in West Bengal, Assam, Tripura, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Bangladesh and the diaspora from this region, and in Nepal where it is called Dashain. The festival is observed in the Hindu calendar month of \"Ashvin\", typically September or October of the Gregorian calendar, and is a multi-day festival that features elaborate temple and stage decorations (\"pandals\"), scripture recitation, performance arts, revelry, and processions. It is a major festival in the Shaktism tradition of Hinduism across India and Shakta Hindu diaspora.\n\nDurga Puja festival marks the battle of goddess Durga with the shape-shifting, deceptive and powerful buffalo demon Mahishasura, and her emerging victorious. Thus, the festival epitomises the victory of good over evil, but it also is in part a harvest festival that marks the goddess as the motherly power behind all of life and creation. The Durga Puja festival dates coincide with Vijayadashami (Dussehra) observed by other traditions of Hinduism, where the Ram Lila is enacted — the victory of Rama is marked and effigies of demon Ravana are burnt instead.\n\nThe primary goddess revered during Durga Puja is Durga, but her stage and celebrations feature other major deities of Hinduism such as goddess Lakshmi (goddess of wealth, prosperity), Saraswati (goddess of knowledge and music), Ganesha (god of good beginnings) and Kartikeya (god of war). In the Bengali traditions, the other deities next to her side are considered to be the children of Durga (Parvati). The Hindu god Shiva, as Durga's husband, is also revered during this festival. The festival begins on the first day with \"Mahalaya\", marking Durga's advent in her battle against evil. Starting with the sixth day (\"Sasthi\"), the goddess is welcomed, festive Durga worship and celebrations begin in elaborately decorated temples and \"pandals\" hosting the statues. Lakshmi and Saraswati are revered on the following days. The festival ends of the tenth day of \"Vijaya Dashami\", when with drum beats of music and chants, Shakta Hindu communities start a procession carrying the colorful clay statues to a river or ocean and immerse them, as a form of goodbye and her return to divine cosmos and Mount Kailash.\n\nThe festival is an old tradition of Hinduism, though it is unclear how and in which century the festival began. Surviving manuscripts from the 14th century provide guidelines for Durga puja, while historical records suggest royalty and wealthy families were sponsoring major Durga Puja public festivities since at least the 16th century. The prominence of Durga Puja increased during the British Raj in its provinces of Bengal and Assam. Durga Puja is a ten-day festival, of which the last five are typically special and an annual holiday in regions such as West Bengal, Assam,Bihar, Odisha and Tripura where it is particularly popular. In the contemporary era, the importance of Durga Puja is as much as a social festival as a religious one wherever it is observed.\n\nIn West Bengal, Bihar, Assam and Tripura, Durga Puja is also called \"Akalbodhan\" (অকাল বোধন, \"untimely awakening of Durga\"), \"Sharadiya Pujo\" (\"autumnal worship\"), \"Sharodotsab\" (, (\"festival of autumn\")), \"Maha Pujo\" (\"grand puja\"), \"Maayer Pujo\" (\"worship of the Mother\"), \"Durga Pujo\", or merely \"Puja\" or \"Pujo\". In Bangladesh, Durga Puja used to be celebrated as \"Bhagabati Puja\".\n\nDurga puja is also called Navaratri Puja elsewhere in India, such as in Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Kerala, and Maharashtra, Kullu Dussehra in Kullu Valley, Himachal Pradesh, Mysore Dussehra in Mysore, Karnataka, Bommai Golu in Tamil Nadu and Bommala koluvu in Andhra Pradesh.\n\nDurga is an ancient deity of Hinduism, according to archeological and textual evidence available. However, the origins of Durga Puja are unclear and undocumented. Surviving manuscripts from the 14th century provide guidelines for Durga Puja, while historical records suggest royalty and wealthy families were sponsoring major Durga Puja public festivities since at least the 16th century. The 11th or 12th century Jainism text \"Yasatilaka\" by Somadeva mentions a festival and annual dates dedicated to a warrior goddess, celebrated by the king and his armed forces, and the description mirrors attributes of a Durga Puja.\nThe word \"Durga\", and related terms appear in the Vedic literature, such as in the \"Rigveda\" hymns 4.28, 5.34, 8.27, 8.47, 8.93 and 10.127, and in sections 10.1 and 12.4 of the \"Atharvaveda\". A deity named \"Durgi\" appears in section 10.1.7 of the Taittiriya Aranyaka. While the Vedic literature uses the word \"Durga\", the description therein lacks the legendary details about her or about Durga puja that is found in later Hindu literature.\nA key text associated with Durga Puja observations is \"Devi Mahatmya\", which is recited during the festival. Durga was likely well established before the time this Hindu text was composed, which scholars variously estimate to between 400 and 600 CE. The \"Devi Mahatmya\" mythology describes the nature of demonic forces symbolized by Mahishasura as shape-shifting, deceptive and adapting in nature, in form and in strategy to create difficulties and achieve their evil ends. Durga calmly understands and counters the evil in order to achieve her solemn goals.\n\nDurga, in her various forms, appears as an independent deity in the Epics period of ancient India, that is the centuries around the start of the common era. Both Yudhisthira and Arjuna characters of the \"Mahabharata\" invoke hymns to \"Durga\". She appears in \"Harivamsa\" in the form of Vishnu's eulogy, and in Pradyumna prayer. The prominent mention of Durga in this popular epics may have led to her worship.\n\nThe Indian texts that mention the Durga Puja festival are inconsistent. The King Suratha legend found in some version of the Puranas mention it to be a spring festival, while the \"Devi-Bhagavata Purana\" and two other Shakta Puranas mention it to be an autumn festival. The more ancient \"Ramayana\" manuscripts are also inconsistent. Versions of \"Ramayana\" found in North, West and South India describe the Hindu god Rama to be remembering the Surya (the Sun god) before his battle with the demon Ravana, but the Bengali manuscripts of Ramayana such as by the 15th century Krttivasa describe Rama to be worshipping Durga.\n\nAccording to Pranab Bandyopadhyay, the worship of fierce warrior goddess Durga, and her darker and more violent manifestation Kali, became very popular in Bengal region during and after the medieval era Muslim invasion. The significance of Durga and other goddesses in Hindu culture, states Patricia Monaghan, increased after Islamic armies conquered Indian subcontinent and attempted to deny iconographic representation of its male and female \"idols\". According to Rachel McDermott, and other scholars such as Brijen Gupta, the persecution of Bengali Hindus in Bengal Sultanate and late medieval era religious politics led to a revival of Hindu identity and an emphasis on Durga Puja as a social festival that publicly celebrated the warrior goddess.\n\nFrom the medieval period up through present day, the Durga Puja has celebrated the goddess with performance arts and as a social event, while maintaining the religious worship.\n\nThe Durga Puja festival is a ten-day event, of which the last five mark the popular practices. The festival begins with \"Mahalaya\", a day where Shakta Hindus remember the loved ones who have died, as well the advent of Durga. The next most significant day of Durga Puja celebrations is the sixth day, called Shashthi where the local community welcome the goddess and festive celebrations are inaugurated. On the seventh day (Saptami), eighth (Ashtami) and ninth (Navami), the goddess along with Lakshmi, Saraswati, Ganesha and Kartikeya are revered and these days mark the main Puja (worship) with recitation of the scriptures, the legends of Durga in \"Devi Mahatmya\" and social visits by families to elaborately decorated and lighted up temples and \"pandals\" (theatre like stages).\nThe Durga festival is, in part, a post-monsoon harvest festival observed on the same days in Shaktism tradition of Hinduism, as those in its other traditions. The practice of including a bundle of nine different plants, called \"navapattrika\", as nature's symbolism of Durga, is a testament practice to its agricultural importance. The typically selected plants include not only representative important crops, but also non-crops. According to David Kinsley, a professor of Religious Studies specializing on Hindu goddesses, this probably signifies the Hindu belief that the goddess is \"not merely the power inherent in the growth of crops but the power inherent in all vegetation\".\n\nThe festival is a major social and public event in eastern and northeastern states of India, where it dominates the religious life, with temporary stage (\"pandal\") built in community squares, roadside shrines and large Durga temples. However, it is also observed by some Shakta Hindus as a private, home-based festival.\nThe festival opens at twilight with prayers to Saraswati, the Hindu goddess of knowledge, wisdom, music, poetry, independent thought, inner knowing and creativity. She is believed to be another aspect of the same one multidimensional goddess Devi Durga, and who is the external and internal activity of all existence, in everything and everywhere. This is typically also the day that the eyes of all deities on the Durga Puja stage are painted, bringing them to a life like appearance. The day also marks prayers to Ganesha and visit to one or more Durga temples.\n\nThe day two to five continue the remembrance and preparation to other aspects (manifestations) of goddess Durga, such as \"Kumari\" (goddess of fertility), \"Mai\" (mother), \"Ajima\" (grandmother), \"Lakshmi\" (goddess of wealth) and in some regions of the \"Saptamatrikas\" (seven mothers) or \"Navadurga\" (nine aspects of Durga).\n\nThe sixth day launches the major festivities and social celebrations. It is called \"Sasthi\" (literally, sixth), the goddess is welcomed, festive Durga worship and celebrations begin in elaborately decorated temples and \"pandals\" hosting the statues. The first nine days overlap with Navaratri festivities in other traditions of Hinduism.\nThe puja rituals are long and complicated. Three days of Mantras (words for spiritual transformation), Shlokas (verse) chants and Arati (prayer) and offerings are made, which include Vedic chants and multiple recitations of the \"Devi Mahatmya\" text in Sanskrit. Durga Slokas (which is also known as Devi Mantra) praises Durga as symbol of all divine forces. According to the sloka, Durga is omnipresent as the embodiment of power, nourishment, memory, forbearance, faith, forgiveness, intellect, wealth, emotions, desires, beauty, satisfaction, righteousness, fulfillment and peace. The specific practices vary by region. The following being most common:\n\n\nDhunuchi Naach, a dance performed with dhunachi (incense burner) is an integral part of the rituals. Drummers called \"dhakis,\" carrying large leather-strung \"dhak\" create music, people dance and complete the final day of worship called \"aarati\".\n\nThe entire process of creation of the sculptures (murti) from the collection of clay to the ornamentation is a ceremonial process. Though the festival is observed post monsoon harvest, the artisans begin making the statues months before, during the summer. The process begins with prayer to Ganesha and to the materials such as bamboo frames in which the statue are cast.\n\nClay, or local soil collected from different parts of the region, forms the base. This choice is a religious tradition wherein Durga, as the creative energy and material, is believed to be present everywhere and everything in the universe. In Kolkata, one custom is to include soil samples, in the clay mixture for Durga, from areas locals believe to be \"nishiddho pallis\" (forbidden territories, brothels).\n\nThe clay base is combined with straw, kneaded then molded into cast made from bamboo. This is set like any clay pot, layered to a final shape, cleaned, and polished when ready. A layer of vegetable fiber called jute, mixed in with clay, is attached to the top to prevent the statue from cracking in the months ahead. The heads of the statues are more complex, and usually cast separately. The limbs of the statues are mostly shaped from bundles of straws. Then, starting about August, the local artisans hand-paint the statues of Durga, Lakshmi, Saraswati, Ganesha, Kartikeya, the lion and the buffalo demon. The goddesses are dressed in fine silk saris, shown bejeweled and put into a pandal.\n\nThe procedures and proportions of statue (\"pratima\" or \"murti\") are described in arts-related Sanskrit text of Hinduism, such as the \"Vishvakarma sastra\".\n\nThe traditional idols, states Christopher Chapple, are made of biodegradable materials such as \"straw, clay, resin, and wood\". In the contemporary era, brighter colored statues have increased and diversified the use of non-biodegradable, cheaper or more colorful substitute synthetic raw materials. Environmental activists have raised concerns about the paint used to produce the statue, stating that the heavy metals in these paints pollute rivers when the statues are immersed at the end of the Durga festival.\n\nBrighter colors that are also biodegradable and eco-friendly, as well as the historic tradition-based natural colors are typically more expensive. The state of West Bengal has banned the use of hazardous paints, and local Indian governments have started distributing lead-free paints to artisans at no cost to prevent heavy metal pollution.\n\nShakta Hindu communities mark the slaying of buffalo demon and victory of Durga with a symbolic or actual sacrifice. Most communities prefer symbolic sacrifice, where a statue of \"asura\" demon made of flour, or equivalent, is immolated and smeared with vermilion to remember the blood that had necessarily been spilled during the war. Other substitutes include a vegetal or sweet dish considered equivalent to the animal. In many cases, Shaktism devotees consider animal sacrifice distasteful, practice alternate means of expressing devotion while respecting the views of others in their tradition.\n\nIn other communities, an actual animal is sacrificed, mainly at temples of Goddess such as Bhavani or Kali. In Nepal, West Bengal, Odisha and Assam, animal sacrifices are performed at Shakti temples, to mark the legend of goddess Durga slaying the buffalo demon. This involves slaying of a fowl, goat or a male water buffalo. This practice is rare among Hindus, outside the region of Bengal, Odisha, Bihar and Assam. Further, even in these states, the festival season is primarily when significant animal sacrifices are observed.\n\nThe Rajput of Rajasthan worship their weapons and horses on Navaratri, and formerly offered a sacrifice of a goat to the goddess – a practice that continues in some places. The ritual requires slaying of the animal with a single stroke. In the past this ritual was considered a rite of passage into manhood and readiness as a warrior. The ritual is directed by a priest. The \"Kuldevi\" among these Rajput communities is a warrior-pativrata guardian goddess, with local legends tracing reverence for her during Rajput-Muslim wars.\n\nMonths before the start of Durga puja, youth members of a community organize as a team, collect donations, engage priests and artisans, buy votive materials and help build a theme-based stage called \"pandal\". The Durga statue is designed from clay and clothes and colors by the commissioned artisans. The design and decoration is a team effort involving artists, architects and community representatives hosting it. The budget required for such theme-based pujas is significantly higher than traditional pujas. These attract crowds of visitors. The preparations and the building of \"pandals\" are a significant arts-related economic activity, often attracting major sponsors.\n\nThe growth of competitiveness in theme pandals have escalated costs and scale of Durga Puja in eastern states of India. Some communities question the billboards, the economic competition behind the Durga Puja between communities, and seek return to basics. The competition takes many forms, such as the height of statue. In 2015, a 88-foot statue of Durga in Kolkata's Deshapriya Park attracted numerous devotees, with some estimates placing visitors at one million.\n\nDurga puja mood starts off with the \"Mahishasuramardini\" – a two-hour radio programme that has been popular with the community since the 1950s. While earlier it used to be conducted live, later a recorded version began to be broadcast. Bengalis traditionally wake up at 4 in the morning on Mahalaya day to listen to the voice of Birendra Krishna Bhadra and the late Pankaj Kumar Mullick on All India Radio as they recite hymns from the scriptures from the \"Devi Mahatmyam\" (\"Chandi Path\").\nTV and radio channels telecast Puja celebrations. Many Bengali/Assamese channels devote whole days to the Pujas. Bengali and Oriya weekly magazines bring out special issues for the Puja known as \"Pujabarshiki\" or \"Sharadiya Sankhya\". These contain the works of many writers both established and upcoming and are thus much bigger than the regular issues. Some notable examples are Anandamela, Shuktara, Desh, Sarodiya Anandabazar Patrika, Sananda, Nabakallol, Bartaman All major local news publications are closed on the last day of the festivities.\n\nThere is enormous variation in worship practices and rituals associated with Durga Puja, as is the case with other Hindu festivals. Hinduism accepts flexibility and leaves the set of practices to the choice of the individuals concerned. Different types of Durga Puja are readily practiced in the same neighborhood, as well as regionally, with these variations accepted across temples, pandals and within families. The festival is most associated with Bengali Hindus, and even there the community grants freedom of variability and accepts differences. Some Puja are flamboyant, some are simple. There are differences in the Puja ambiences between theme-based pujas of cities and puja pandals of towns/villages, between family pujas and community (barowari) pujas of neighborhoods or apartments. \nThe style and nature of the Puja varies from being Vedic, or Puranic, or Tantric, or a combination of these. The Bengali Durga Puja typically combines all three. The non-Bengali Durga Puja tends to be essentially Vedic (srauta) wherein the melodies of Vedic hymns are sung, but it too incorporates esoteric elements making the Puja an example of a Vaidik-Tantric practice.\n\nHistorical evidence suggests that the Durga Puja has evolved over time, becoming more elaborate, social and creative. The festival has been a domestic puja, a form of practice that remains popular. Durga Puja is also practiced in the \"sarvajanin\" (public) form, where communities get together, pool their resources and effort to set up \"pandals\", lighting decorations etc. and then celebrate the event as a megashow to share. The origins of the latter variation are unclear, with some evidence suggesting a family in Kolkatta revived this celebration in 1411 CE. Another set of sources suggest that a Bengali landlord named Kamsanarayan held a megashow in 1583, or by others in late 16th century Bengal. Yet, this festival of Bengal is likely much older with the discovery of 11th and 12th century Durga Puja manual manuscripts such as \"Durgotsavaviveka\", \"Durgotsava Prayoga\", \"Vasantaviveka\" and \"Kalaviveka\". The rituals associated with the Durga Puja migrated to other regions, from Bengal, such as those in Varanasi, a city that has historically attracted sponsorship from Hindus from various parts of the Indian subcontinent including Bengal. In contemporary India, Durga Puja is celebrated in numerous styles and forms.\n\nDurga Puja is the biggest and most widely celebrated festival of West Bengal, Bihar, Assam and Odhisa. It is held over a five-day period. The city is decked up with festive lights, loudspeakers play popular songs as well as recitation of mantras by priests, thousands of beautiful \"pandals\" are erected by communities in cities, towns and villages across the state, but particularly in Kolkata. The roads become overcrowded with hundreds of thousands of revellers, devotees and pandal-hoppers visiting the pandals on Puja days. It creates a chaotic traffic condition despite all efforts of traffic and crowd management. Shops, eateries, restaurants stay open all night; fairs are set up and cultural programmes are held. People form organizing committees, which plan and oversee the \"pandal\" (temporary shrine and stage) for the festivities. Today, Durga Puja has turned into a consumerist social carnival, biggest public spectacle and major art event riding on the wave of commercialisation, corporate sponsorship and craze for award-winning. For private domestic pujas, families dedicate an area of their homes known as \"thakur dalan\" for Durga Puja inside which the potters place Durga and then the dressers deck decorate it with home-dyed fabric, sola ornamentation and gold and silver foil decorations. Elaborate rituals like \"arati\" are performed and \"prasad\" is distributed after being offered to the gods. As a tradition, married daughters return to or revisit their parents and celebrate the Durga Puja together, a symbolism for goddess Durga who is believed to return to her parent's home for the festival.\nDurga Puja is a major gift-giving and shopping season in Bengal, with people buying gifts for not only the family members but also for close relatives and friends. New clothes are the traditional gift, and people wear them to go out together to visit countless Puja pandals. Some people go to the places of tourist attractions during the Puja holidays, while others return home from their workplaces to spend the festive days with their family members. Beyond being a family, social and religious event, Durga Puja has also been a political theatre. Major regional and national political parties have sponsored and leveraged Durga Puja to spread their ideologies given the festival's importance to the culture of Bengali Hindus.\n\nThe organizing committees of each pandal hires a \"purohita\" (priest) who performs the puja rituals on behalf of the community. For the priests, the Durga Puja is a major time of activity, wherein he pursues the timely completion of a busy Vedic-Puranic-Tantric ritual sequence along timed to various offerings and fire oblations, in full public view, while the social festivities occur in parallel. The complex rituals include periods of accurate and melodic scripture recitation. The third and fourth day of the Puja are increasingly complex, while hundreds of thousands of people visit to witness it. On the day of Vijayadashami, the idols are carried out in grand immersion processions across Bengal and then the idols are ritually immersed into the rivers or waterbodies amid singing, water-throwing and fireworks. The immersion ceremony continues till a couple of days after. \n\nAccording to Claire Alexander and other scholars, the ritual of immersing Durga idol into river attracted the attention of colonial era travelers to the Bengal region from Europe, such as Garcin de Tassy and Emma Roberts. In 1831, Tassy reported that similar rituals were annually observed by Islamic community in Bengal as well. Shia Muslims observed Muharram over 10 days, took out processions in memory of their Imam Husayn ibn Ali, and then cast a memorial Imam's cenotaph into a river on the 10th day. Further, stated Tassy, the Muslim rituals included the same offerings at their annual festival in the memory of their Imam during Muharram, as the Hindus did during Durga Puja. According to Aslam Syed, the immersion in water ritual by Hindus for Durga in Bengal, and Ganesh in the western states of India, may have grown because the Hindu leaders attempted to create a competing procession and immersion ritual to that of Islamic Muharram allowed by the colonial British government in the 19th and early 20th century.\n\nNashik holds four major celebrations – including: the Government of India Press grounds organised by Nashik Sarbojanin Durga Puja Committee which is the oldest and biggest; the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (H.A.L)in Ojhar; at Artillery Station, Deolali; the industrial area of Satpur-Ambad. In recent years, places such as CIDCO, Rajeevnagar, Panchavati and Mahatmanagar also have set up Durga Puja mandals.\n\nIn 1910, a year before Delhi was declared the capital of British India, the first \"Sarbojanin\" (community) puja in Delhi was organised near Kashmiri Gate by a group of expatriate Bengalis, including the doctor Hemchandra Sen. This group became the Delhi Durga Puja Samiti, popularly known as the \"Kashmere Gate Puja\". The Timarpur puja (near Delhi University) started in 1914.\n\nIn 2011, over 800 pujas were held in Delhi, with a few hundred more in Gurgaon and Noida.\n\nThere were over 2500 community celebrations in Tripura as of 2013. Durga Puja began over 200 years ago at the Durgabari temple in Agartala, started by King Radha Kishore Manikya Bahadur.\n\nDurga Puja is widely celebrated by the Bangladesh's minority Hindu community. Some Bengali Muslims also take part in the \"pujo\" (Durga Puja). In Dhaka, the Dhakeshwari Temple and mandaps attract numerous visitors and devotees, and on Vijaya Dashami, the immersion processions head to Sadarghat (Dhaka's river port), where the idols are immersed.\n\nIn the recent past, Durga Puja celebrations and festivities were also started in Hong Kong by the Bengali diaspora.\n\nDurga Puja in Nepal is called Dashain.\n\nDurga Puja is organized by some Bengali communities in the United States.\n\nDurga Puja is organised by Bengali communities in Europe. Although pandals are not constructed, the sculptures are imported from India. According to BBC News, for community celebrations in London in 2006, these \"idols, belonging to a tableau measuring 18ft by 20ft, were made from clay, straw and vegetable dyes\". At the end of the Durga Puja, these were immersed in River Thames, for the first time in 2006, after \"the community was allowed to give a traditional send-off to the deities by London's port authorities\". The Bengali community stated, per the BBC News report, that the immersion ceremony \"is a very sentimental issue for us, everybody wanted to see the idols being given a proper immersion\".\n\nIn Germany, Durgapuja is celebrated in several cities across the country. Some of the top mentions are \"Duesseldorf Durgapuja\", who have been celebrating this since 2012 with the same zeal and vigour as in India. The Indische Gemeinde Duesseldorf is the organization which manages this 4 day extravaganza with voluntary support from members of the club and first time visitors alike. The event consists of performing all rituals to the book, Prasad after the puja, Indian Lunch, Dinner and snacks every day for all visitors, Cultural programmes from members of the club as well as by performing artists flown out of India, and Sandhya Arati (Evening worship) along with the Dhak (traditional drum) and kansor (traditional metal disc).\nThe biggest Durga Puja in Germany is celebrated in Cologne Durga puja;. \nIt is also celebrated in Munich, Berlin and other German cities.\n\nIn Switzerland, the 'Swisspuja' group based in Baden, Aargau, in northern Switzerland, has been celebrating Durga Puja since 2003.\n\nIn Sweden Durgapuja is celebrated in many places like Stockholm and Helsingborg.\nA group 'Bengali Cultural Society - South Sweden (BCSOFSS)' based on Helsingborg has started Durgapuja since 2017.\nIn Netherlands Durgapuja is celebrated in several places like Amstelveen, Eindhoven and Voorschoten. Bengali community 'Holland-e-Hoichoi' and 'Anandadhara Netherlands' has started Durga Puja in Amstelveen (close to Amsterdam) since 2017.\n\n"}
{"id": "48818401", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48818401", "title": "Elands Bay Cave", "text": "Elands Bay Cave\n\nElands Bay Cave is located near the mouth of the Verlorenvlei estuary on the Atlantic coast of South Africa's Western Cape Province. The climate has continuously become drier since the habitation of hunter-gatherers in the Later Pleistocene. The archaeological remains recovered from previous excavations at Elands Bay Cave have been studied to help answer questions regarding the relationship of people and their landscape, the role of climate change that could have determined or influenced subsistence changes, and the impact of pastoralism and agriculture on hunter-gatherer communities.\n\nRenowned archaeologist John Parkington excavated Elands Bay Cave in the 1970s providing vast information of the cave's inhabitants. Parkington frequently used methods of comparing various characteristics in his findings in order to highlight phases of transformations at Elands Bay Cave. Other archaeologists and specialists have analyzed the findings from Parkington. Parkington, Cartwright, Cowling, Baxter, and Meadows (2000), analyzed wood charcoal and pollen data from Elands Bay Cave to explain the environmental change. Klein, in 2001 studied fossil remains and faunal data to indicate hunter-gatherer behavioral and cultural adaptations. In 1999, Cowling, Cartwright, Parkington, & Allsopp researched wood charcoal in order to explain environmental changes. Woodborne, Hart, & Parkington (1995) researched seal bones to construct the timing and the duration of hunter-gatherer coastal journeys. Orton (2006) examined raw materials to produce a lithic sequence for the Later Stone Age in Elands Bay Cave. Lastly, Matthews (1999) used taphonomy and previous research by Peter Andrews to understand the formation and interpretation of micromammals at Elands Bay Cave.\n\nThe coastline of Elands Bay Cave has changed dramatically since the end of the Ice Age. A coastal plain once extended some 20 km west of Elands Bay Cave into the sea. Heavier rainfall and different ocean levels allowed Elands Bay Cave to be a lush environment in the past. Testing of faunal remains, bones, and wood charcoals provided evidence of wetter conditions in the terminal Pleistocene. During that time, the environment consisted of colder weather with heavier rain fall which created vegetation that was different than it is today. Now, it has become a drier environment with different species residing there. Rainfall from 9,600 to 13,600 years ago produced 400 mm comparable to today’s 300 mm. More recent environmental conditions near Elands Bay Cave are characteristic of mild weather with an approximated 200–250 mm per year of rainfall occurring every winter. Elands Bay Cave is in close proximity (approximately 3 kilometers) to a rich intertidal environment supporting numerous shellfish species, sea birds, kelp beds, and marine mammals.\n\nOver time, the climatic atmosphere near Elands Bay Cave became drier and the soil conditions turned to sand. Dense shrubs are maintained by older sand creating patches of subtropical plants in the area. These environmental changes resulted in a reduction of available resources such as fresh water, mussels, and shellfish.\n\nTransitions from the last glaciation to the Holocene had a significant impact on the type of vegetation and wildlife that could be supported along the southern coast. Researchers suggest that because of increased aridity, the inhabitants of Elands Bay Cave abandoned the site and migrated elsewhere. Lack of archaeological remains concerning the dates of 8,000 to 4,400 and 4,000 BP support the theory of an occupation hiatus during these time frames.\n\nArchaeological excavations at Elands Bay Cave began in the 1970s. Scientific interest has focused on investigating coastal changes, subsistence and seasonal mobility. Faunal remains representing the time period of 13.600-12.000 years ago were left behind by the cave's occupants. The majority of the faunal assemblage consists of grazing animals and is indicative of a grassland environment. The faunal remains were examined and compared to collections at the South Africa Museum in Cape Town. Few marine specimens were recovered from this time span and is indicative of the 12 km distance from the cave to the coast. Cartwright and Parkington (1997) excavated 6,700 fragments of wood charcoal that were retrieved through dry sieving large soil samples of 39 collections. Excavation of wood charcoal and pollen in the cave suggests that last glacial maximum had wetter conditions with lush forests and Afromontane elements 20,000 years ago. There were also varieties of charcoal tested from 20,000, 13,500, and 10,500 years ago. Researchers have also analyzed micromammals, such as mice, as paleoenvironmental indicators. Micromammal remains were encountered during excavations and occur throughout the units dating from 13,260 to 300 years before present. The micromammal specimens were recovered using 12mm and 3mm sieves, however, the researchers comment that this mesh size was likely too large to account for smaller faunal remains. Understanding the taphonomic processes that contributed to the deposition of the micromammal remains at Elands Bay Cave is important because it has identified a number of predators likely responsible for the accumulation of faunal material. that became a great tool for formation of micromammal collection. Excavations in Elands Bay Cave and surrounding areas support a hypothesis of migration in winter months. Assemblages of shellfish findings portray that the theory of shellfish changing in size during prehistoric times because of environment was overthrown and was replaced by consuming large amounts of shellfish at the time. Observations and excavations were done in Elands Bay Cave in order to properly identify species of fish bones with accurate representation in specific levels. Excavations that were conducted from 1970 to 1978 in Elands Bay Cave concluded that there was a stratified sequence of deposits that dated to the late Pleistocene. Between 8000 and 6000 years ago, the rise in sea level eventually resulted in the present location of Elands Bay Cave now on the coast. Excavations after 4,000 BP revealed there were 13 different species of fish represented at the site, 6 of which are still found today in the aquatic milieus. These findings supported the conclusion that due to the close proximity to the coast, fishing activities were the dominant subsistence strategy practiced by the people who occupied Elands Bay Cave. With the coastline in its present-day location by about 6000 years ago, the inhabitants of the cave were thus in a favorable location to exploit marine resources.\n\nThere are 60 radiocarbon dates that represent activity during the Holocene, a large part of the terminal Pleistocene, and also the last glacial maximum. Stratigraphy dating and the Middle Stone Age artifacts are at the base, then ashy loam's before 20,000 years ago BP, lastly topped with shell middens. Upper shell middens range from 3,800 to 300 BP, though there was a disturbance of accumulation from 7,900 years ago that stopped for about 4,000 years. Around 11,000 to 9,000 years ago the terrestrial fauna began to change. Shell middens from the Holocene are on top of Pleistocene soil that was accumulated from the last glacial period. Prior to 9,000 BP, seals do not appear to be seasonal at Elands Bay Cave. The seal collection was divided into two collections: upper ranging from 1,400 BP and lower ranging from 10,000 BP to 9,500 BP. Charcoal that was 40,000 years old was studied. Proteoid fynbos was able to be harvested because of improved soils in 12,450 BP to 13,600 BP. In the terminal Pleistocene, approximately 16,000 to 8,000 years ago, ostrich egg shells and animal bones were introduced to the cave. Establishment of non-micro lithic industry was discovered to be from 10,000 BP continuing on to 8900 BP. It is found that major increase of formal tools took place in 9,500 BP. The transitions of tool assemblages in Elands Bay Cave are assumed to be from 8,800 to 8,500 BP. In 8,000 BP Holocene, Elands Bay Cave had microlithics for the first time. Radiocarbon dates indicate that Albany Industry was in use circa 13,000 and 9,000 BP.\n\nElands Bay Cave is perceived as the central site because it includes the largest sample sizes and covers more time spans. Elands Bay Cave has been used at different times for various purposes; evidence found at the cave suggests that there is a series of overlapping events that are in no constant order. The research that has been done in the cave concludes that people lived there around 4,400 to 3,000 years ago and that hunting and gathering activities persisted until the 17th century AD. Migration patterns were found due to shell midden evidence from marine resources archaeologists found displaying exploitation from that time. All the research contributes in various ways of monitoring stratigraphic anomalies within Elands Bay Cave.\n\nGroup sizes varied at different points, some were just a few families and at other times there could have been up to 100 people. Either way, a community was built. Hunter-gatherers became more advanced in the Later Stone age compared to the Middle Stone Age. Expansion of hearths found inside Elands Bay Cave illustrates that people were skillful with fire. It also indicates cultural evolution by gathering together when it was dark or cold outside. They also discovered that hunter-gatherers stored food underground in containers and used ostrich eggs as portable water vessels. People from the Later Stone Age seemed to have gathered the most remains from fish and aerial birds which indicate artefactual observation conclusion of people fishing and fowling routinely.\n\nSeal mandibles that were found at the cave were compared to mandibles from South Africa Museum and Department of Sea Fisheries Collection. The upper division of seals collection explained that seals were hunted during winter and spring months. This implies that hunter-gatherers would purposefully plan to be at the Elands Bay Cave at those times. The lower collection finds that there was no seasonal correlation to habitation and that the seals were 2 years old. The study of seal mandibles aid in gaining understanding of deaths and predict probable seasonal migration. Through carbon isotope testing, upper level dating of seal bones were found to not be consistent with findings of human remains at the same time. These findings were all to demonstrate that the cave was accessible and used to easily capture seals pups. Animal bones demonstrate drastic change in vegetation. Seal bones are plentiful after 11,000 to 10,000 BP. Bones used to identify seals in Elands Bay Cave are mainly the remains of limb bones, such as the humeri. These bone types can be distinguished from other wildlife skeletal remains because they lack a marrow cavity. During 11,000 to 10,000 BP sea levels rose, this allowed seals to be exploited through hunting.\n\nBefore 4,000 BP people from Elands Bay Cave would gather wood from moister plants that would grow in different areas. Pollen in small denominations is discovered from the last glacial maximum but none from past that time. This is presented through the connection of higher moisture availability supporting fuel wood accessibility and variety. Samples of wood charcoal and pollen that are 17,000 to 20,000 years old (terminal Pleistocene) show a connection to vegetation rather than rainfall. Recent charcoal resembles xeric thicket and states that vegetation was more diverse. There is a drainage system that has gone through Elands Bay Cave, the Velorenvlei. It is speculated that the connection from that drainage system to Elands Bay Cave has a significant impact on the collection of pollen that is found in Elands Bay Cave. It is revealed that the moisture in the soil has been deteriorating from at least 4,000 years ago; other observations conclude similar findings because of evidence from pollen and faunal remains from the same epochs.\n\nThe stratigraphy of Elands Bay Cave is dominated by shell midden as well as levels composed of ashy matrix interpreted as living floor features containing remnants of grasses possibly used as bedding, bone and shell. There was 40 cubic meters of shell middens found from the Holocene period. Aside from mussel shells, middens consisted of ostrich shells and other marine shells. It was discovered that ostrich eggs, used as water containers, were sometimes repurposed as beads after breaking. Some wood charcoal from 40,000 years ago from the terminal Holocene (300 years ago) to early late Pleistocene revealed that it was beyond range of carbon dating. There was only 25-44 g/m3 microfaunal found. In early Holocene, limpets were the dominant species represented within the midden levels. Four stratigraphic levels were observed throughout the middens and were documented. Stages 1,2, and 3 are the top three levels; they are believed to be dated to around 1,500 to 600 BP. The lower stage, level 4, is understood to be dated no older that 1,500 BP.\n\nArcheological evidence supports taphonomy investigations in order to rule out assumptions of extinction or depletion of wildlife. It is important to identify who the predator is before environment analysis. It was found that the study of taphonomy was important because it allowed researchers to distinguish the factors responsible for the collection and establishment of habits and behaviors of different species. Researchers discovered that predator species contributed to micromammal accumulations and with this, helped recreate the environment they lived in. Remains from different predator birds show that the Barn Owl was not the only airborne wildlife using the cave as a shelter. Additional suspect predators include different owl species such as the spotted eagle owl, the giant owl, the Cape eagle owl, as well the black backed jackal and the grey mongoose.\n\nThere were remains of sheep bones found at Elands Bay Cave between 2,000 and 1,500 BP. The first bone collectors in Elands Bay Cave were discovered to be people from the Stone Age. Some bones were gnawed and chewed, which predicted the habitation of carnivores and porcupines. Evidence suggests that mole rats could have been introduced by people bringing them when they migrated to Elands Bay Cave or, the more likely suggestion is that they were brought by Eagle owls after 10,000 BP. There are fluctuations in evidence which are reflections of periods when the owls used the cave. Fossil samples from mole rat humeri’s were collected and tested. Jaws and foot bones are the most common bones used to identify species since they are long-lasting and easy to identify even when in pieces. Over time there was a reduction in mole rat sizes in the collections, likely because of weather and environmental changes. This would explain the appearance of certain animals like hedgehogs since they favor wetter climates. Some animals such as the Cape horse became extinct and others like the hedgehog came about. This could be seen through fossils found in soil deposits.\n\nFish species within the faunal assemblage recovered from Elands Bay Cave increased over time and represent both estuary and marine varieties. This is a reflection of higher sea levels from the conversion of the last glaciation to the Holocene. Excavations from 1970 to 1978, revealed that the white steenbras was the most prevalent fish species. The varying size of the white steenbras over time may reflect a fishing technology that employed the use of fish gorges. Layers where bone gorges were present typically were void of small age classes. Fish species remained relatively unchanged throughout the Holocene levels, with the most common type being the Sparidae.\n\nShellfish remains discovered after 4,000 BP indicate an increase in marine resource exploitation and represents a shift away from mammals as the dietary staple. This was produced because the coastline became part of the cave’s basin. A high percentage, 90%, of shell middens from the Holocene period were black mussels. These types of findings in an area would indicate a settlement with shellfish being a large portion of their daily nutritional intake. In Elands Bay Cave there were three main shell middens remains: Black mussels, and two different classes of limpets. The shells that were found had not reached full adulthood within the cave, which leads archaeologists to believe that they were an essential part of their diet. There were notable different sizes outside the cave but it is speculated that it is because of the consumption inside the cave that the mussels were accessible and therefore, there was a slim chance for the shellfish to reach mature age.\n\nUntil 9,000 years ago in the Late Pleistocene and early Holocene, stone tools were made out of quartz. There was an abundance of vein quartz, even if found in small forms like pebbles. Even though the principal material of the tools was quartz, other materials were also found in sizable quantities. These include a substantial amount of hornfels, tough siltstones, and dolerite. Aside from quartz and silcrete, the other materials are unknown on how they got to the location. Quality raw materials are suspected to have been brought from other regions. It is also suggested that they could have manifested through trade or simply carried in from migration.\n\nElands Bay Cave was not always occupied. There are conflicting theories of seasonal migration to the cave just like in the Early Holocene. Yet, lack of evidence of seals in Elands Bay Cave at that time leads some to suggest that it was not a seasonal habitation. Since there are no signs of transitions even with the vast diverse archeologically evidence of faunal and artifact remains, it suggests to some that people did live there for a long time not just occasionally. Hunter-gatherers were able to understand and use the land at a local and regional scale. This is demonstrated with the large amount of seal evidence in faunal collection in the terminal Pleistocene. Migration could have been an occurrence because of harsh weather and less agricultural resources which would lead them to find a location that produced more dietary supplements.\n\nAlthough charcoal analysis proved faunal diversity, more research is needed to close gaps in charcoal records. Changing behavior, creating culture, and emergence of new systems need to still be studied in depth in order to gain a greater sense of the historical Elands Bay Cave community.\n"}
{"id": "46287679", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46287679", "title": "External render", "text": "External render\n\nAn external render is, in its most basic form, a coating applied to the walls of a building, to provide a protective coating which would prevent rain penetration. It also acts as a decorative finish to enhance the appearance of a building.\n\nRendering is a traditional craft that has evolved over many centuries. Basic rendering began as a method of excluding draughts and rain by using clay to fill in cracks and crevices, referred to as wattle-and-daub. Other renders, based on lime binders were also used over the years. These materials had one significant disadvantage in that they were not very resistant to water.\n\nThe introduction of Portland cement meant that durable mortars could be produced and weather resistant renders resulted. Through the years technological advances have aided the development of cutting edge render systems that aim to improve the longevity of a buildings structural capacity.\n\nTraditionally, a render would be manufactured on site by a plasterer mixing sand, cement and sometimes lime material together with water to produce his render. This would then be applied to the walls, usually in either two or three coats.\n\nWhen painting, there is usually a primer, an undercoat and a topcoat. Similarly in renders there may be a stipple coat, then an undercoat (sometimes called a base coat) and finally a final coat (sometimes called a topcoat). The difference is that in renders, the final thickness is 15 mm.\n\nDevelopment of a site mixed render is the factory made render. All the render ingredients are dry blended together in a modern factory, creating a powdered product which can be supplied in bags. When the product is delivered to site the plasterer just needs to mix the product with water and apply it to the wall.\n\nThe factory made render has an advantage over the site mixed render in that the composition of the render and all the raw materials are closely controlled and accurately measured. Supplying a render in this way allows the manufacturer to include performance enhancing additives into the formulation. Whilst many site mixed renders are subsequently painted, factory made renders can be supplied as a wide variety of self-coloured products, eliminating the additional expense of painting.\n\nThere are two main methods of applying render, by hawk and trowel or by machine. In the hawk and trowel method the product is first mixed with water to a workable paste and then the plasterer applies the wet paste render to the wall and levels it off, using a hawk and trowel. Machine applied renders are usually factory made products. The machine is essentially a mixing pump which mixes the product with water and pumps the paste to a nozzle which sprays it onto the wall. The wet paste is than levelled off. Application of render using a machine is usually a much faster operation than by hand, meaning that larger areas can be rendered during a working day. The application of render has to be completed in the correct weather conditions. If the temperature is too low, moisture can be trapped within the render. If the temperature is too high, the render will dry out too quickly, leading to the formation of cracks.\n"}
{"id": "1208779", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1208779", "title": "Glamorama", "text": "Glamorama\n\nGlamorama is a 1998 novel by American writer Bret Easton Ellis. \"Glamorama\" is set in and satirizes the 1990s, specifically celebrity culture and consumerism. \"Time\" describes the novel as \"a screed against models and celebrity.\"\n\nEllis wanted to write a Stephen King-style ghost story novel, which would eventually become \"Lunar Park\"; finding it difficult at the time, he began work on the other novel which he had in mind. This was a Robert Ludlum-style thriller, with the intention of using one of his own vapid characters who lack insight as the narrator.\n\nThe novel is a satire of modern celebrity culture; this is reflected in its premise, which features models-turned-terrorists. A character remarks, \"basically, everyone was a sociopath ... and all the girls' hair was chignoned.\" The novel plays upon the conspiracy thriller conceit of someone \"behind all the awful events\", to dramatize the revelation of a world of random horror . The lack of resolution contributes to Ellis' artistic effect. The obsession with beauty is reflected in consistent namedropping; this satirizes (the main character) Victor's obsession with looks, and perhaps is indicative of the author's own attraction to glamor.\n\nEllis drops names in \"Glamorama\" so often that \"Entertainment Weekly\" describes \"Nary a sentence ... escapes without a cameo from someone famous, quasi-famous, or formerly famous. In fact, in some sentences, Ellis cuts out those pesky nouns and verbs and simply lists celebrities.\" Namedropping and commoditization have a depersonalizing effect (a world reduced to \"sheen and brands\"); as the reviewer for \"The Harvard Crimson\" observes, \"When Victor undergoes a transformation to a law student, we know he is different because he now wears a Brooks Brothers suit and drinks Diet Coke. London and Paris become nothing more than a different collection of recognizable proper nouns (Notting Hill and Irvine Welsh in the first case; \"Chez Georges\" and Yves Saint Laurent in the second).\" A writer for the \"New York Times\" observes \"much of his prose consists of (intentionally) numbingly long lists of his characters' clothes and accouterments ... out of which his loft-dwellers somewhat hopefully attempt to assemble something like an identity\". In speech, his writing demonstrates the ways in which his characters, too, have internalized the language of consumerist advertising and marketing. According to the \"Lakeland Ledger\", \"Glamorama\" is something of a \"Through the Looking-Glass\" allegory and a cautionary tale navigating the perils of dissolving identity.\n\nIn parody of how people now think in modern terms, Ellis \"annoying[ly]\" lists \"the songs that are playing in the background, or even quoting them, as he does with Oasis' \"Champagne Supernova\"; in effect, the novel is provided with a movie soundtrack. As such, the book feels at times like a movie, and sometimes more specifically, a snuff film. New technology such as photo manipulation software (e.g. \"PhotoSoap for Windows 95\") are featured in the novel. This creates an ironic situation in which Victor, the character obsessed by appearances, is haunted by fake images that appear real which implicate him in a murder; it becomes hard to tell what is real in the 'modern' world. As such, \"meaningful identity is obliterated\"; this furthers the recurring joke from \"American Psycho\" wherein \"characters are always getting confused by their friends with other people, with no noticeable consequences\".\n\nThe book prominently contains the conceit wherein Victor's life is being filmed by a camera crew \"introduced a third of the way into the book\". As well as a postmodern device to examine the questionable \"reality\" of the situation, it also functions as a \"tidy commentary\" on the advent of mass surveillance in the 1990s. \"EW\" interprets the scene to mean \"Modern life has become a movie (a point made more cogently by Neal Gabler's new book, \"Life the Movie\").\" The \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\" took the same meaning from the conceit, and described it as a \"not-so-deep observation\" that \"has no real pay-off\". The \"New York Times\" felt it was a \"halfhearted narrative device ... suggesting that the novel's action is actually part of a film that's being made.\" The reviewer felt that allusions to \"\"the director\" or to the fact that this or that scene is a \"flashback\"\" was used to retroactively suggest cohesion in the novel's plot.\n\n\"As much as celebrity itself, our collective celebrity worship becomes the real target of Ellis' satire\", writes the \"Star Tribune\". Models in the novel act as a synecdoche of the larger culture. Reviewer Eric Hanson writes, \"Their [models'] selfishness and brutality, he implies, are simply an extreme manifestation of what consumer culture encourages in everyone.\" Victor's own pursuit of being cool or too hip \"destroys him\". A CNN reviewer gives the example of Victor not wanting to explain his impersonator, \"because the places he was seen were always hot spots he should have frequented.\"\n\nVictor Ward is the novel's lead character, who had previously appeared as Victor Johnson in \"The Rules of Attraction\" (1987). In \"Glamorama\", now an \"A-list model, would-be-actor and current \"It boy\", \"an uberstereotype of the male model\", Victor lives by his catchphrase mantra \"the better you look, the more you see\". As \"Harvard Crimson\" observes, \"His lifestyle is the extreme of everything the current culture worships: he can't avoid thinking in brand names and image and speaks with lines from pop songs.\" Uncharacteristic for an Ellis protagonist, as the \"Crimson\" notes, Victor is \"terrified by\" the \"coldbloodedness\" he encounters when he becomes embroiled in international terrorism. As an unintelligent narrator, Victor (through his inability to comprehend his situation), underlines how \"the world of celebrity in \"Glamorama\" is inescapable\". Compared to other Ellis protagonists, Victor is less \"sensitive and insightful\" than \"Less Than Zero\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Clay, neither the \"preening psychopath\" that is \"American Psycho\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Patrick Bateman\", he is nevertheless an \"[un]sympathetic protagonist (in his own way, he's as morally bankrupt as ... Patrick Bateman).\" As narrator, \"Victor's perceptions\" sum up \"[the glamor world's] disconnection from what the rest of us consider \"real life\"... [where] Everything he sees is a brand name.\" CNN speculates when Victor begins speaking to the novel's \"film crew\" (one of its literary devices), that this could mean that the character is schizophrenic. Victor comes across \"oddly homophobic for a member of the pansexual New York fashion scene\"; when his gay assistant accuses \"I know for a fact you've had sex with guys in the past\", he retorts that he did \"the whole hip bi thing for about three hours back in college\".\n\nThe mysterious F. Fred Palakon first appears a quarter of the way into the novel, when he offers to pay Victor $300,000 to track down his former Camden classmate Jamie Fields, a double-agent working in the terrorist organisation with which Victor becomes involved. It is never clarified exactly which political organisation Palakon appears to be working for; he even appears alongside Senator Johnson, Victor's father, a United States Senator with ambitions to become President. Of Palakon, 'the director' says \"We've been through this a hundred times ... There is no Palakon. I've never heard that name. Victor's girlfriend Chloe Byrnes is a supermodel and a recovering drug addict. Alison Poole, the main character from Jay McInerney's 1988 novel \"Story of My Life\", appears, having also previously appeared in \"American Psycho\" in 1992. In \"Glamorama\", Alison is \"[Victor's] boss's girlfriend (another supermodel)\", \"here playing Lewinsky\". Bobby Hughes is a successful male model and the leader of his international terrorist group. Victor engages in a bisexual threesome with him and with Jamie Fields. Lauren Hynde from \"The Rules of Attraction\" also reappears, having become a successful actress with ties to Hughes' terrorist organisation; other \"Rules\" characters appear (e.g., in flashback) such as Bertrand, who is now a terrorist also.\n\nIn 1999, the contemporary Italian composer Lorenzo Ferrero wrote a composition for chamber ensemble entitled \"Glamorama Spies\", which was inspired by the novel.\n\n\"Glitterati\" is a 2004 film directed by Roger Avary assembled from the 70 hours of video footage shot for the European sequence of \"The Rules of Attraction\". It expands upon the minimally detailed and rapidly recapped story told by Victor Ward, portrayed by Kip Pardue, upon his return to the United States after having travelled extensively around Europe. In regard to expanding upon those events, the film acts as a connecting bridge between \"The Rules of Attraction\" and the upcoming film adaptation set to be directed by Avary. Avary has called \"Glitterati\" a \"pencil sketch of what will ultimately be the oil painting of \"Glamorama\".\"\n\nIn 2009, Audible.com produced an audio version of \"Glamorama\", narrated by Jonathan Davis, as part of its \"Modern Vanguard\" line of audiobooks.\n\nIn 2010, when a film adaptation of \"Glamorama\" was mentioned in an interview with Movieline.com, Bret Easton Ellis commented, \"I think the days of being able to make that movie are over.\" From the same interview, Ellis mentioned that an idea for a mini-series adaptation was brought forth to HBO though it was ultimately declined and further stating the movie would be left in Roger Avary's hands if one was to be made.\n\nOn October 13, 2011, Bret Easton Ellis reported on Twitter the following: \n\nFans have noted similarities to the 2001 Ben Stiller comedy \"Zoolander\". Ellis stated that he is aware of the similarities, and went on to say that he considered and attempted to take legal action. Ellis was asked about the similarities in a 2005 BBC interview. In the response to the question, he said that he is unable to discuss the similarities due to an out-of-court settlement.\n\nMuch criticism of the novel noted its length. \"Time\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Joel Stein noted \"The idea—models so solipsistic that they become terrorists—is a good-enough one for a short story of 15 pages, but it's unsustainable at 482.\" He describes the book's first 185 pages as \"inanely repetitive\". \"Entertainment Weekly\" opines \"It's like reading Page Six of the \"New York Post\", but for 482 pages.\" One reviewer found the opening scenes \"funny enough\" although noted that it \"gets tired easily\". Contrarily, the \"Star Tribune\" felt \"the satiric early half is Ellis in peak form, the thriller-style second half is less successful.\" In fact, the humour in the novel was praised by multiple critics. The \"Star Tribune\" notes Victor's lack of depth, malapropisms, overuse of the word \"baby\" and the novel's \"enchantingly disaffected monotone\" of \"a been-there-done-that Valleyspeak\". Hanson felt that the horror elements in the \"labyrinthian\" thriller section of the novel seemed \"recycled from \"American Psycho\".\" \"Entertainment Weekly\" also state their preference for the \"first 189 pages\". Contrarily, the \"New York Times\" felt that the book was devoid of fun, where even the blackest satire (e.g. Evelyn Waugh's \"Loved One\") are more humorous.\n\n\"EW\" places \"Glamorama\" within an emerging tradition of celebrity satire, noting \"the glitterati are the satirical target du jour, what with Woody Allen's limp, oral-sex-filled film \"Celebrity\", and Jay McInerney's clever novel \"Model Behavior\"\" (both 1998). McInerney (a friend of Ellis) noted the novel's comparative darkness to his own \"Model Behaviour\" (also about 90s nightlife and supermodels), published the same year, saying \"I deliberately wrote a comic novel because you don't go chasing butterflies with sledgehammers\". (Regarding McInerney's novel, Stein had felt that the novelist's attempt at a zeitgeist novel was one \"looking at the '90s through an '80s lens\".) \"Harvard Crimson\" noted, similar to McInerney, that \"Celebrity by itself teeters so often into self-parody that it seems too easy to bash it\" but remarks that \"Fortunately, Ellis does more than that injecting \"Glamorama\" with a sharper plot than those of earlier novels, a plot which kicks in about a quarter of the way into the novel.\" The \"New York Times\" question the choice of subject matter as well: \"Ellis's satirical message is, essentially, a one-liner, and hardly an original one at that – celebrity culture is vapid, yes, and?\" The reviewer furthermore suggested \"\"Glamorama\" is itself just another artifact of the culture it pretends to criticize.\"\n\nThe book's style is summarized by one reviewer as \"a book that reads like a movie\", and another notes that Ellis' writing \"can be sharp\", and succeeds in creating a \"creepy sense of dread about our culture\". On its influence, \"Time\" felt that the novel's \"contribution\" to the world comes in Victor's catchphrase, which they describe as Tom Wolfean. In an otherwise damning review, the \"New York Times\" commented \"[Ellis] has an uncannily keen eye for the tiny details of the lives of the abel-obsessed yuppies and would-be celebs he's sending up\". A CNN reviewer felt, upon reading the book, that \"Bret Easton Ellis is a gifted writer\"; he praised his \"unflinching eye\" in capturing the details of \"the ensemble worn by a notorious clothes horse, or the grisly aftermath of a hotel bombing, or the graphic details of a menage a trois .\" The world Ellis evokes, through the eyes of the male model, \"Harvard Crimson\" notes is one \"where no one has any emotions beyond the visceral response, where all the sex scenes are described in purely pornographic terms.\"\n\nA.J. Jacobs of \"Entertainment Weekly\" did not enjoy the book's more \"meta\" conceits, and gives the novel a 'C'. Daniel Mendelsohn of the \"New York Times\" opines derisively that \"Like its predecessors, \"Glamorama\" is meant to be a withering report on the soul-destroying emptiness of late-century American consumer culture, chichi downtown division; but the only lesson you're likely to take away from it is the even more depressing classic American morality tale about how premature stardom is more of a curse than a blessing for young writers.\" The CNN reviewer concludes \"in the end, \"Glamorama\" is less than the sum of its parts\".\n\nEllis himself has claimed that, as of 2018, the novel has failed to break even for its US publisher, Knopf.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1178749", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1178749", "title": "Grindhouse", "text": "Grindhouse\n\nA grindhouse or action house is an American term for a theater that mainly shows exploitation films. According to historian David Church, this theater type was named after the \"grind policy\", a film-programming strategy dating back to the early 1920s which continuously showed films at cut-rate ticket prices that typically rose over the course of each day. This exhibition practice was markedly different from the era's more common practice of fewer shows per day and graduated pricing for different seating sections in large urban theaters, which were typically studio-owned.\n\nDue to these theaters' proximity to controversially sexualized forms of entertainment like burlesque, the term \"grindhouse\" has often been erroneously associated with burlesque theaters in urban entertainment areas such as 42nd Street in New York City, where \"bump and grind\" dancing and striptease were featured. In the film \"Lady of Burlesque\" (1943) one of the characters refers to one such burlesque theatre on 42nd Street as a \"grindhouse,\" but Church points out the primary definition in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" is for a movie theater distinguished by three criteria:\n\nChurch states the first use of the term \"grind house\" was in a 1923 \"Variety\" article, which may have adopted the contemporary slang usage of \"grind\" to refer to the actions of barkers exhorting potential patrons to enter the venue.\n\nDouble, triple, and \"all night\" bills on a single admission charge often encouraged patrons to spend long periods of time in the theaters. The milieu was largely and faithfully captured at the time by the magazine \"Sleazoid Express\".\n\nBecause grindhouse theaters were associated with a lower class audience, grindhouse theaters gradually became perceived as disreputable places that showed disreputable films, regardless of the variety of films — including subsequent-run Hollywood films — that were actually screened. Similar second-run screenings are held at discount theaters and neighborhood theatres; the distinguishing characteristics of the \"grindhouse\" are its typical urban setting and the programming of first-run films of low merit, not predominantly second-run films which had received wide releases.\n\nThe introduction of television greatly eroded the audience for local and single-screen movie theaters, many of which were built during the cinema boom of the 1930s. In combination with urban decay after white flight out of older city areas in the mid to late 1960s, changing economics forced these theaters to either close or offer something that television could not. In the 1970s, many of these theaters became venues for exploitation films, either adult pornography and sleaze, or slasher horror and dubbed martial arts films from Hong Kong.\n\nFilms shot for and screened at grindhouses characteristically contain large amounts of sex, violence, or bizarre subject matter. One featured genre were \"roughies\" or sexploitation films, a mix of sex, violence and sadism. Quality varied, but low budget production values and poor print quality were common. Critical opinions varied regarding typical grindhouse fare, but many films acquired cult following and critical praise.\n\nBy the 1980s, home video and cable movie channels threatened to render the grindhouse obsolete. By the end of the decade, these theaters had vanished from Los Angeles's Broadway and Hollywood Boulevard, New York City's Times Square and San Francisco's Market Street.\n\nBy the mid-1990s, these particular theaters had all but disappeared from the United States. Very few exist today.\n\nThe Robert Rodriguez film \"Planet Terror\" and the Quentin Tarantino film \"Death Proof\", which were released together as \"Grindhouse\" in 2007, were created as an homage to the cinematic genre. Similar films such as \"Machete\" (also by Rodriguez), \"Chillerama\", \"Drive Angry\" and \"Sign Gene\" have appeared since.\n\n\"Red Dead Revolver\", \"\", \"Wet\", \"Shank\", \"RAGE\", \"Shadows of the Damned\" and \"Zombie Hunter\" are several examples of video games that serve as homages to the grindhouse movies.\n\nThe author Jacques Boyreau released the book \"Portable Grindhouse: The Lost Art of the VHS Box\" in 2009 about the history of the genre. The field is also the focus of the 2010 documentary \"American Grindhouse\".\n\nThe Syfy TV show \"Blood Drive\" takes inspiration from grindhouse, with each episode featuring a different theme.\n\nThe novel \"Our Lady of the Inferno\" is both written as an homage to grindhouse films and features several chapters that take place in a grindhouse theater.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "27400824", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27400824", "title": "Indigitamenta", "text": "Indigitamenta\n\nIn ancient Roman religion, the indigitamenta were lists of deities kept by the College of Pontiffs to assure that the correct divine names were invoked for public prayers. These lists or books probably described the nature of the various deities who might be called on under particular circumstances, with specifics about the sequence of invocation. The earliest \"indigitamenta\", like many other aspects of Roman religion, were attributed to Numa Pompilius, second king of Rome.\n\nThe books of the Pontiffs are known only through scattered passages preserved throughout Latin literature. Varro is assumed to have drawn on direct knowledge of the lists in writing his now-fragmentary theological books, which were used as a reference by the Church Fathers for their mocking catalogues of minor deities. As William Warde Fowler noted,\nthe good Fathers tumbled the whole collection about sadly in their search for material for their mockery, having no historical or scientific object in view; with the result that it now resembles the bits of glass in a kaleidoscope, and can no longer be re-arranged on the original Varronian plan.\n\nGeorg Wissowa, however, asserted that Varro's lists were not \"indigitamenta\", but \"di certi\", gods whose function could still be identified with certainty, since by the late Republic some of the most archaic deities of the Roman pantheon were not widely cultivated and understood. Another likely source for the patristic catalogues is the lost work \"De indigitamentis\" of Granius Flaccus, Varro's contemporary.\n\nW.H. Roscher collated the standard modern list of \"indigitamenta\", though other scholars may differ with him on some points.\n\nIt is unclear whether the written \"indigitamenta\" contained complete prayer formularies, or simply an index of names. If formulas of invocation, the \"indigitamenta\" were probably \"precationum carmina\", chants or hymns of address. Paulus defines them as \"incantamenta\", incantations, and \"indicia\", signs or intimations.\n\nA further point of uncertainty is whether these names represent distinct minor entities, or epithets pertaining to an aspect of a major deity's sphere of influence, that is, an indigitation, or name intended to \"fix\" or focalize the action of the god so invoked. If the former, the \"indigitamenta\" might be described as indexing \"significant names which bespoke a specialized divine function,\" for which the German term \"Sondergötter\" is sometimes used; for instance, Vagitanus gives the newborn its first cry \"(vagitus)\". If the \"indigitamenta\" record invocational epithets, however, an otherwise obscure deity such as Robigus, the red god of wheat rust, should perhaps be understood as an indigitation of Mars, red god of war and agriculture; Maia, \"a deity known apparently only to the priests and the learned,\" would be according to Macrobius an indigitation of the Bona Dea. Roscher, however, does not consider Robigus and Maia to have been part of the \"indigitamenta\".\n\nMany of the \"indigitamenta\" are involved in the cycle of conception, birth, and child development (marked ); see List of Roman birth and childhood deities. Several appear in a list of twelve helper gods of Ceres as an agricultural goddess or are named elsewhere as having specialized agricultural functions (). Gods not appearing on either of those lists are described briefly here, or are more fully described in their own articles as linked.\n"}

Interpretation centres are a kind of new-style museum, often associated with visitor centres or ecomuseums, and located in connection to cultural, historic or natural sites.\n\nInterpretation centres use different means of communication to enhance the understanding of heritage. To aid and stimulate the discovery process and the visitor's intellectual and emotional connection to heritage, the main presentation strategy tends to be user-friendly and interactive, and often use scenographic exhibitions and multimedia programs. Many interpretation centres have temporary exhibitions related to a specific aspect of the site.\nAn interpretation centre can be a viable solution for effective communication of heritage information in municipalities and rural areas where resources may not exist to establish a traditional, full-scale museum, and where heritage can be an important factor for tourism development.\n\nUnlike traditional museums, interpretation centres do not usually aim to collect, conserve and study objects; they are specialized institutions for communicating the significance and meaning of heritage. They work to educate and raise awareness. Non-core jobs as conservation and research are services usually done by specialized, external entities.\n\n"}

{"id": "1359892", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1359892", "title": "Lost in Translation (poem)", "text": "Lost in Translation (poem)\n\n\"Lost in Translation\" is a narrative poem by James Merrill (1926–1995), one of the most studied and celebrated of his shorter works. It was originally published in \"The New Yorker\" magazine on April 8, 1974, and published in book form in 1976 in \"Divine Comedies\".\n\nThe poem opens with a description of a summer Merrill spent as a child in a great house in The Hamptons, with his governess, waiting patiently for a rented wooden jigsaw puzzle to arrive in the mail from an Upper East Side Manhattan puzzle rental shop.\n\n\"Lost in Translation\" is Merrill's most anthologized poem, and has been widely praised by literary critics including Harold Bloom.\n\nMerrill wrote in his lifetime mainly for a select group of friends, fans, and critics, and expected readers of \"Lost in Translation\" to have some knowledge of his biography. Born in New York City, Merrill was the son of the founder of the world's largest brokerage firm. He enjoyed a privileged upbringing in economic and cultural terms, although his intelligence and exceptional financial circumstances often made him feel lonely as a child. Merrill was the only son of Charles E. Merrill and Hellen Ingram. (Merrill had two older half siblings from his father's first marriage.)\n\nGiven that his parents were often preoccupied, his father with business, his mother with social obligations, Merrill developed a number of close relationships with household staff. \"Lost in Translation\" describes a profound childhood bond with the woman who taught him French and German. Merrill's parents would divorce in 1939, when Merrill was thirteen years old, in a scandal that was front-page news on the \"New York Times\".\n\nNot only is \"Lost in Translation\" a poem about a child putting together a jigsaw puzzle, it is an interpretive puzzle, designed to engage a reader's interest in solving mysteries at various narrative levels.\n\nThe poem is dedicated to Merrill's friend, the distinguished poet, critic, and translator Richard Howard. It consists of 215 lines with an additional four line epigraph. The poem is mainly in unrhymed pentameter but includes a section in Rubaiyat quatrain stanzas. \"Lost in Translation\" may be classified as an autobiographical narrative or narrative poem, but is better understood as a series of embedded narratives (stories within a story).\n\nUnusual for Merrill, the poem bears a mysterious four-line epigraph in German, which is printed without translation or attribution:\n\nIn James Merrill's own English version of this epigraph (published in 1985 in \"Late Settings\"), these four lines are translated into English as follows:\n\nIn \"Lost in Translation\", the narrator's puzzle-making companion is his French governess, whom he repeatedly refers to as \"Mademoiselle.\" Part mother, part teacher, part nanny, part servant, she is described by Merrill as \"stout, plain, carrot-haired, devout.\"\n\nAt one point in the poem, Mademoiselle speaks the same phrase in French and in German. In addition to playing with the boy's marionettes and doing jigsaw puzzles with him, Mademoiselle is teaching the young James Merrill languages which would be critical to making him the sophisticated and urbane lyric poet of later life. By giving name, in several languages, to objects and tasks around the home, Mademoiselle helps the young James Merrill come to understand a doubleness about language itself, that objects and activities can have different names and connotations across languages.\n\nFrom the child's point of view, the \"puzzle\" goes well beyond what is taking place on the card table. Merrill is puzzling through the mystery of his existence, puzzling through the mystery of what the world is, what objects are, what people do in life. An unspoken puzzle is solved when the young Merrill determines what his relationship to Mademoiselle is, given the frequent absence of his own mother. Mademoiselle knows \"her place\", he writes, indicating his first consciousness of his own class privilege, as well as (perhaps) the limits placed on Mademoiselle's maternal role.\n\nYet other puzzles are not solved until later in life. At one point the narrator's voice modulates into that of an adult. We find out that Mademoiselle hid her true origins from the boy (and from his family) because of the political tensions leading up to 1939 and to the outbreak of World War II. Mademoiselle claimed to be French and hid her German or Alsatian birth. She presumably gained a French family name through marriage to a soldier who died in the Battle of Verdun in World War I (1914–1918). Mademoiselle could let no one know she was German for fear of losing her job and her employers' trust. This explains the fact that Merrill's own French, learned in imitation of his governess, was always spoken with a slight German accent. The boy finds out the full truth only as an adult, after a chance conversation with Mademoiselle's grown nephew, a United Nations interpreter, who tells him the story of the governess's true origins.\n\nThe poem includes several other secondary narratives, including a section in which the puzzle itself is put together. Inspired by Omar Khayyám's \"Rubaiyat\" quatrains, Merrill describes an imaginary harem-like 19th century Orientalist painting, by an alleged follower of Jean-Léon Gérôme, that begins to appear as the puzzle pieces are put together. When the puzzle is nearly done, the piece that was missing the whole time is found under the table at the boy's feet. The missing piece is, in fact, an image of the boy's feet. When it is put in place, the portrait of the little boy in the puzzle is finally complete.\n\nAt the center of the poem is a mysterious sequence in which the poet, attending a present-day séance, describes a medium who is able to divine that a piece of a wooden jigsaw puzzle has been concealed inside a box.\n\nTo understand \"Lost in Translation\", the reader must work out and solve a puzzle in the narrative text, revealed by a confession Merrill the adult makes at the end of the poem. The little boy has apparently kept a piece of the jigsaw puzzle, in the shape of a palm tree, throughout his life. This fact has jogged the memory in Merrill of a poem called \"Palme\" by the French Symbolist poet Paul Valéry (1871–1945), and that memory in turn has reminded Merrill of a German translation he has once seen of that same poem by poet Rainer Maria Rilke (1875–1926).\n\nThe poet knows that he has seen and read the Rilke translation before, because he can picture the words on the page. \"The owlet umlaut peeps and hoots/ Above the open vowel\", Merrill writes, in some of the poem's most quoted lines. Yet despite remembering the experience of reading the Rilke translation, he cannot locate a copy in Athens, Greece (where Merrill and his partner David Jackson were living six months of the year), and begins to doubt whether it exists except in his imagination. The poem \"Lost in Translation\" assumes the form of a letter to Richard Howard seeking an actual copy of that translation.\n\nBut the translation turns out not to have been lost, or a figment of the poet's imagination, for it is used to write the poem \"Lost In Translation.\" The German epigraph at the beginning of the poem offers the key clue here. The four lines come from that \"lost\" German translation by Rilke of Valéry's \"Palme\". (Merrill's own English translation of \"Palme\" is the source of the translated quatrain above. See Merrill's \"Paul Valéry: \"Palme\"\" in \"Late Settings\", 1985.)\n\nThe original in French:\n\nfrom Paul Valéry, Charmes (1922) Palme classical dizain 7th Stanza \n\nThe solution to the puzzle of the poem is hidden in plain sight all along. \"Nothing's lost\", Merrill suggests, when it comes to translating experience or memory, at least according to the way Merrill understands our human experience. The poem's coda salutes the power of the transformative imagination to recover meaning in the world from all we see and remember. Its language and phrasing offer a veiled tribute by Merrill to the poet he most admired from his father's generation, Wallace Stevens (author of \"The Palm at the End of the Mind\"):\n\n"}

They told of subjects such as the Creation, Adam and Eve, the murder of Abel, and the Last Judgment. Often they were performed together in cycles which could last for days. The name derives from \"mystery\" used in its sense of \"miracle,\" but an occasionally quoted derivation is from \"ministerium\", meaning \"craft\", and so the 'mysteries' or plays performed by the craft guilds.\n\nAs early as the fifth century living tableaux were introduced into sacred services.\nThe plays originated as simple \"tropes\", verbal embellishments of liturgical texts, and slowly became more elaborate. At an early period chants from the service of the day were added to the prose dialogue. As these liturgical dramas increased in popularity, vernacular forms emerged, as travelling companies of actors and theatrical productions organized by local communities became more common in the later Middle Ages.\n\nThe \"Quem quaeritis?\" is the best known early form of the dramas, a dramatised liturgical dialogue between the angel at the tomb of Christ and the women who are seeking his body. These primitive forms were later elaborated with dialogue and dramatic action. Eventually the dramas moved from church to the exterior - the churchyard and the public marketplace. These early performances were given in Latin, and were preceded by a vernacular prologue spoken by a herald who gave a synopsis of the events. The writers and directors of the earliest plays were probably monks. Religious drama flourished from about the ninth century to the sixteenth.\n\nIn 1210, suspicious of the growing popularity of miracle plays, Pope Innocent III issued a papal edict forbidding clergy from acting on a public stage. This had the effect of transferring the organization of the dramas to town guilds, after which several changes followed. Vernacular texts replaced Latin, and non-Biblical passages were added along with comic scenes, for example in the \"Secunda Pastorum\" of the Wakefield Cycle. Acting and characterization became more elaborate.\n\nThese vernacular religious performances were, in some of the larger cities in England such as York, performed and produced by guilds, with each guild taking responsibility for a particular piece of scriptural history. From the guild control originated the term mystery play or mysteries, from the Latin \"ministerium\" meaning \"occupation\" (i.e. that of the guilds). The genre was again banned, following the Reformation and the establishment of the Church of England in 1534.\n\nThe mystery play developed, in some places, into a series of plays dealing with all the major events in the Christian calendar, from the Creation to the Day of Judgment. By the end of the 15th century, the practice of acting these plays in cycles on festival days was established in several parts of Europe. Sometimes, each play was performed on a decorated pageant cart that moved about the city to allow different crowds to watch each play as well as provided actors with a dressing room as well as a stage The entire cycle could take up to twenty hours to perform and could be spread over a number of days. Taken as a whole, these are referred to as \"Corpus Christi cycles\". These cycles were often performed during the Feast of Corpus Christi and their overall design drew attention to Christ's life and his redemption for all of mankind.\n\nThe plays were performed by a combination of professionals and amateurs and were written in highly elaborate stanza forms; they were often marked by the extravagance of the sets and 'special effects', but could also be stark and intimate. The variety of theatrical and poetic styles, even in a single cycle of plays, could be remarkable.\n\nThere are four complete or nearly complete extant English biblical collections of plays; although these collections are sometimes referred to as \"cycles,\" it is now believed that this term may attribute to these collections more coherence than they in fact possess. The most complete is the \"York cycle\" of forty-eight pageants; there are also the \"Towneley plays\" of thirty-two pageants, once thought to have been a true 'cycle' of plays acted at Wakefield; the Ludus Coventriae, now generally agreed to be a redacted compilation of at least three older, unrelated plays, and the \"Chester cycle\" of twenty-four pageants, now generally agreed to be an Elizabethan reconstruction of older medieval traditions. Also extant are two pageants from a New Testament cycle acted at Coventry and one pageant each from Norwich and Newcastle upon Tyne. Additionally, a fifteenth-century play of the life of Mary Magdalene, \"The Brome Abraham and Isaac\" and a sixteenth-century play of the \"Conversion of Saint Paul\" exist, all hailing from East Anglia. Besides the Middle English drama, there are three surviving plays in Cornish known as the Ordinalia, and several cyclical plays survive from continental Europe.\n\nThese biblical plays differ widely in content. Most contain episodes such as the \"Fall of Lucifer\", the \"Creation and Fall of Man\", \"Cain and Abel\", \"Noah and the Flood\", \"Abraham and Isaac\", the \"Nativity\", the \"Raising of Lazarus\", the \"Passion\", and the \"Resurrection\". Other pageants included the story of \"Moses\", the \"Procession of the Prophets\", \"Christ's Baptism\", the \"Temptation in the Wilderness\", and the \"Assumption and Coronation of the Virgin\". In given cycles, the plays came to be sponsored by the newly emerging Medieval craft guilds. The York mercers, for example, sponsored the \"Doomsday\" pageant. Other guilds presented scenes appropriate to their trade: the building of the Ark from the carpenters' guild; the five loaves and fishes miracle from the bakers; and the visit of the Magi, with their offerings of gold, frankincense and myrrh, from the goldsmiths. The guild associations are not, however, to be understood as the method of production for all towns. While the Chester pageants are associated with guilds, there is no indication that the N-Town plays are either associated with guilds or performed on pageant wagons. Perhaps the most famous of the mystery plays, at least to modern readers and audiences, are those of Wakefield. Unfortunately, we cannot know whether the plays of the Towneley manuscript are actually the plays performed at Wakefield but a reference in the \"Second Shepherds' Play\" to Horbery Shrogys is strongly suggestive. In \"The London Burial Grounds\" by Mrs Basil Holmes (1897), the author claims that the Holy Priory Church, next to St Katherine Cree on Leadenhall Street, London was the location of miracle plays from the tenth to the sixteenth century. Edmund Bonner, Bishop of London (c 1500 - 1569) stopped this in 1542.\n\nThe most famous plays of the Towneley collection are attributed to the Wakefield Master, an anonymous playwright who wrote in the fifteenth century. The epithet \"Wakefield Master\" was first applied to this individual by the literary historian Gayley. The Wakefield Master gets his name from the geographic location where he lived, the market-town of Wakefield in Yorkshire. He may have been a highly educated cleric there, or possibly a friar from a nearby monastery at Woodkirk, four miles north of Wakefield. It was once thought that this anonymous author wrote a series of 32 plays (each averaging about 384 lines) called the Towneley Cycle. The Master's contributions to this collection are still much debated, and some scholars believe he may have written fewer than ten of them. These works appear in a single manuscript, currently found in the Huntington Library of California. It shows signs of Protestant editing — references to the Pope and the sacraments are crossed out, for instance. Likewise, twelve manuscript leaves were ripped out between the two final plays because of Catholic references. This evidence strongly suggests the play was still being read and performed as late as 1520, perhaps as late in Renaissance as the final years of King Henry VIII's reign.\n\nThe best known pageant in the Towneley manuscript is \"The Second Shepherds' Pageant\", a burlesque of the Nativity featuring Mak the sheep stealer and his wife Gill, which more or less explicitly compares a stolen lamb to the Saviour of mankind. The \"Harrowing of Hell\", derived from the apocryphal \"Acts of Pilate\", was a popular part of the York and Wakefield cycles.\n\nThe dramas of the Elizabethan and Jacobean periods were developed out of mystery plays.\n\nThe Misteri d'Elx (in English, the Elx Mystery Play or Mystery Play of Elx) is a liturgical drama dating from the Middle Ages which has been enacted and celebrated every year without any known interruptions. Commemorating the Assumption of Mary, it is played on every 14 and 15 August in the Basilica de Santa María in the city of Elx (also known as Elche). The prohibition of theatrical plays in churches by the Council of Trent eventually threatened to interrupt the yearly performance of the Misteri, but in 1632 Pope Urban VIII issued a special permit for its continuation. In 2001, UNESCO declared it one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.\n\nThe oldest liturgical drama (12th century) written already in old Spanish language was a codex found in the library of the Toledo Cathedral. The Auto de los Reyes Magos belongs to the Christmas cycle. It is a play about the Biblical Magi, three wise men from the East who followed a star and visited the baby Jesus in Bethlehem. It is believed to have been based on an earlier liturgical Latin play written in France.\n\nMiracle plays, or \"Saint's plays,\" are now distinguished from mystery plays as they specifically re-enacted miraculous interventions by the saints, particularly St. Nicholas or St. Mary, into the lives of ordinary people, rather than biblical events; however both of these terms are more commonly used by modern scholars than they were by medieval people, who used a wide variety of terminology to refer to their dramatic performances. Robert Chambers, writing in the 19th century, notes that \"especially in England, miracle [came] to stand for religious play in general\".\n\nCornish language miracle plays were performed in plain-an-gwarrys. To capture the attention of the audience, \"the plays were often noisy, bawdy and entertaining\".\n\nMystery Plays are still produced regularly throughout the United Kingdom. The local cycles were revived in both York and Chester in 1951 as part of the Festival of Britain, and are still performed by the local guilds. The N-Town cycle was revived in 1978 as the Lincoln mystery plays,\n\nIn 1977 the National Theatre commissioned Tony Harrison to create \"The Mysteries\", a re-working of the Wakefield Cycle and others. It was revived in 1985 (whereupon the production was filmed for Channel 4 Television), and again as a part of the theatre's millennium celebration in 2000. The productions won Bill Bryden the \"Best Director\" title in both the Evening Standard Theatre Awards and the Olivier Awards for 1985, the year the three plays first appeared together in performance at the Lyceum Theatre. An adaptation of Harrison's play was staged at Shakespeare's Globe in 2011 as \"The Globe Mysteries\".\n\nIn 2001, the Isango Ensemble produced an African version of the Chester Cycle at the Garrick Theatre in London as \"The Mysteries – Yiimimangaliso\", performing in a combination of the Xhosa language, the Zulu language, English, Latin and Afrikaans. They revived an adapted version of the production at Shakespeare's Globe in 2015 as \"The Mysteries\". In 2004, two mystery plays (one focusing on the Creation and the other on the Passion) were performed at Canterbury Cathedral, with actor Edward Woodward in the role of God. The large cast also included Daniel MacPherson, Thomas James Longley and Joseph McManners.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14240633", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14240633", "title": "National Symphony Orchestra (Mexico)", "text": "National Symphony Orchestra (Mexico)\n\nThe National Symphony Orchestra (\"Orquesta Sinfónica Nacional\", OSN) is the most important classical music and symphonic ensemble in Mexico. With its origins traced back as 1881, it is the second-oldest symphony orchestra in the American continent along with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. The orchestra does not have a permanent venue but performs regularly in the Grand Hall of the Palace of Fine Arts (Palacio de Bellas Artes) in Mexico City.\n\nNot to be confused with the Orquesta Sinfónica del Estado de México (OSEM) or Symphony Orchestra of the State of Mexico, founded in 1971, the National Symphony Orchestra of Mexico, as a branch of the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes, was created by presidential decree of Miguel Alemán on 18 July 1947, under the name of National Conservatory Symphony Orchestra. Before that, however, there was a predecessor orchestra known as the Symphony Orchestra of Mexico (September 2, 1928 – March 8, 1949), a nonprofit organization founded and conducted by Mexican composer, conductor, teacher, journalist and visionary arts leader Carlos Chávez. On 1 August 1947, Chávez appointed Blas Galindo as the new director of the National Conservatory, official seat of the new orchestra. Chávez reports that the National Symphony Orchestra gave its first official performance on 30 October 1947 at the Palace of Fine Arts, under the baton of Eduardo Hernández Moncada, its first music and artistic director.\n\nAnother decree on April 25, 1949, changed the name of the ensemble to National Symphony Orchestra (Orquesta Sinfónica Nacional or OSN); first, to emphasize its professional character—it had the best musicians in the country—and to avoid confusing it with a student ensemble, despite Chávez's having from the very beginning considered the orchestra a national symphony, linked in some aspects to the most important music education institution, the National Conservatory; and second, Chávez wanted to highlight that “a National Symphony, by definition, is a State institution,” and the government had recognized the need to support an institution of public interest.\n\nThe social context that Mexico was living during the beginnings of the 20th century made the task of creating an orchestra difficult, so there were several attempts to form a national symphony orchestra.\n\nThe orchestra has its roots back in 1881, when Alfredo Bablot, director of the Music Conservatory (founded July 1, 1866) initiated the Conservatory Orchestra. When Bablot died, he was replaced by Carlos J. Menéses. In 1902 the orchestra had little support from the government of Porfirio Díaz, but it suspended its activities in 1913, two years after Díaz's fall, because of the general instability in the country during the Mexican Revolution.\n\nAfter Gen. Venustiano Carranza, took over the national government's seat back to Mexico City in 1915, the orchestra took the name of National Symphony, and depended from the Bellas Artes bureau, and its director during this period was Jesús Acuña, followed by composer Manuel M. Ponce but he declined and the orchestra suspended the concert seasons. Later, composer Julián Carrillo, who was a very important figure in music history worldwide, was appointed as the Music Conservatory director, and took up the project for an orchestra again, and depended from the Conservatory, but because of lack of financial support from the government, the orchestra again finished its activities in 1924.\n\nIn 1928, the Mexican Symphony Orchestra was created, but the name changed shortly to Symphony Orchestra of Mexico (\"Orquesta Sinfónica de México\") . This orchestra is more related to the current orchestra. Carlos Chávez was appointed as its first conductor, but it lacked of any financial support, besides that the orchestra wasn't being well administrated by the city's musician syndicate of that time. While Chávez conducted the orchestra, it meaning a flourishing period for the orchestral music in the country.\n\nA private patronage was established and the orchestra could give its first concert. The date was September 2, 1928, and the place, the Iris Theatre. With 103 musicians on stage, the programme included Debussy´s \"Ibéria\" Suite, Tello's \"Sonata Tragica\", Tchaikovsky´s \"Piano Concerto No. 1 in B-flat minor\" with Vilma Erenyi as soloist, and Strauss´ \"Don Juan\". Although the orchestra received financial support from the government, this was considered as a private one, not official, like it is constituted today. This is the most important point to consider the nature of this musical organization at the present time.\n\nMexican composer Silvestre Revueltas, who was second in charge as assistant conductor, left the orchestra in 1935 to be the principal conductor of a newly created and short-lived National Symphony Orchestra that depended from the National Music Conservatory, but it closed in 1937 when Revueltas resigned.\n\nOn November 23, 1946, president Miguel Alemán proposed the creation of the National Institute of Fine Arts and Literature (\"Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes y Literatura\"), known by the acronym INBA, and was formally opened on 1 January 1947, as a branch of the Secretaría de Educación Pública, (SEP) (Secretariat of Public Education). The first head of the INBA was Carlos Chávez, who created a new orchestra for the Conservatory (thus because the conservatory depended on the INBA administration). On January 19, 1949, Chávez resigned his job as conductor of the Symphony Orchestra of Mexico, to spend more of his time composing and directing the INBA, but the orchestra didn't disappear, because Chávez succeeded in making the government recognize a national ensemble (working on this issue, since he was appointed as head of the INBA), so the actual organization known as National Symphony Orchestra of México was established, and Eduardo Hernández Moncada was designated its first conductor in 1947, José Pablo Moncayo replaced him in 1949.\n\nMoncayo was succeeded in 1954 by Luis Herrera de la Fuente, who led the orchestra until 1972. During this period the orchestra had very important tours nationwide and worldwide, especially in Europe. In 1973 Chávez returned to conduct the orchestra but resigned in the first month due to internal conflicts with the orchestra members. This resulted in the formation of a new artistic administration by some of the musicians and representatives from the INBA called co-government. Under this arrangement there was no principal conductor; instead, the orchestra had host conductors for its seasons and a Mexican assistant director for off-season affairs.\n\nAfter several years of this arrangement, the orchestra accepted to have a conductor again in 1979, appointing Sergio Cárdenas, who served until 1984. After him served Jose Guadalupe Flores from 1985 to 1986, followed by Francisco Savín from 1986 to 1988, and from 1989 to 1990 Luis Herrera de la Fuente returned. Participation in national festivals, music workshops, conferences, band concerts and chamber music concerts were offered by the orchestra during these years.\n\nIn May 1990, Enrique Arturo Diemecke was appointed as new conductor. He revived the tradition of touring promoted by Herrera de la Fuente during his first term, traveling to festivals in Portugal and Spain in 1992 and touring within Mexico and United States in 1999 and 2002. During his direction, the orchestra encouraged soundtrack concerts that consisted of playing music from films like the Mexican \"Redes\", music by Aaron Copland or \"West Side Story\" from Leonard Bernstein and several others. Didactic concerts for kids, concerts with worldwide renowned soloists like Jorge Federico Osorio, Frederica von Stade and violin virtuoso Itzhak Perlman were held by the orchestra in these years, and in 2002 the orchestra was nominated for Latin Grammy award for Best Classical Album. In 2003 the orchestra celebrated its 75th Anniversary with a concert in Mexico's National Auditorium performing the Ludwig van Beethoven´s Symphony No. 9 (Choral), Op. 125 with an almost sold out locations. In November 2006, after 16 years of continuous works, Diemecke left the orchestra.\n\nThe orchestra's current musical director, Carlos Miguel Prieto, named at the end of 2007, has launched the orchestra on a new era, aiming to place it on a par with the world's leading ensembles. In early 2008 he led it on its first European tour in years, culminating with an acclaimed concert at Amsterdam's renowned Concertgebouw Hall. Also in 2008 the orchestra celebrated its 80th Anniversary.\n\n\n\n"}

Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company. Its activities encompass commissioning, producing, and presenting works of dance, performance and music, together with allied education programming and services for artists. Live Arts is located in New York City’s Chelsea neighborhood. Its building features a 184-seat theater, rehearsal studios and offices. The organization was formed in 2011 when Dance Theater Workshop (DTW) and the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company merged. Bill T. Jones is Artistic Director of New York Live Arts.\n\nNew York Live Arts was created in 2011 through the merger of Dance Theater Workshop and The Bill T. Jones Arnie Zane Dance Company. The merger was conceived by the boards and staff of both organizations to address specific challenges each was facing around 2009. Dance Theater Workshop was struggling with capitalization and fundraising-capacity problems connected to substantial debt and operating costs it had assumed to develop its building, which opened in 2002. For its part, the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company had been looking to establish its first studio/office facility and had recently been advised that its bid to become a tenant of a new building in Harlem had been rejected despite its having secured commitments of $13 million in public funding to support the development of the space.\n\nNews of the possibility of a merger generated discussion within the New York City contemporary dance scene. DTW had been a vital part of New York City dance since 1965, helping nurture the careers of hundreds of dancers and companies. There was concern that having a single artist, Bill T. Jones, at the head of the organization could alter the eclectic and inclusive spirit that had distinguished DTW.\n\nFollowing a months-long process of discussions, community forums and negotiations, the boards of both organizations agreed that the shared values of the two entities and the complementary expertise of their staffs pointed to the possibility that a merger could address the immediate needs of both organizations and open new possibilities for the combined organization. The Jones organization committed to raising $3 million to pay down the bond debt on the DTW building as part of the merger agreement. Simultaneous with the merger announcement, the two entities unveiled the New York Live Arts name, noting that the omission of the word \"dance\" was meant to suggest potential future directions encompassing a wider range of art forms.\n\nNew York Live Arts is overseen by an 18-member board. Bill T. Jones serves as Artistic Director, supported by Associate Artistic Director Janet Wong. Kim Cullen is Executive Director overseeing day-to-day operations in concert with approximately 25 full-time staff members New York Live Arts' annual budget is approximately $5 million, supported by philanthropic contributions, earned income, and government support.\n\nThe Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company is the largest and most visible program of New York Live Arts. The company, founded in 1982, tours internationally and has long been considered a leading force in contemporary dance. It has been a primary vehicle for Bill T. Jones to realize his creative vision, and is noted for its engagement with political and social issues. The company rehearses at New York Live Arts and occasionally performs there.\n\nNew York Live Arts mounts an annual season of performances at its theater that features of a range of artists and companies, presented both independently and in partnership with other organizations.\n\n\"Live Ideas\" is a humanities festival presented each spring that focuses on a single topic rooted in an aspect of thinking about the body that is explored through lectures, panel discussions, performances, films and other activities.\n\n\"The Randjelovic/Stryker Resident Commissioned Artist\" is a two-year residency for distinguished mid-career artists. The residency offers a salary and health benefits, in addition to studio space in which to develop a new work for premiere at New York Live Arts.\n\n\"Live Feed\" is a residency program in which select artists are given opportunities to undertake explorations of a new work, possibly for later commission by Live Arts, through rehearsal time, informal studio showings and public dialogues.\n\n\"Fresh Tracks\" is a professional development program and showcase for early-career artists. Each year five artists chosen through an open call receive 50-hours of studio time, a slot on a shared-evening bill in the Live Arts theater, and a range of professional-development sessions on the business and challenges of artistic careers.\n\n\"Live Core\" is a suite of artist services that includes fiscal sponsorship, consultations with Live Arts staff members, marketing support and other perquisites.\n\nNew York Live Arts occupies the basement and first three levels of an 11-story condominium tower. The basement and first level are dedicated to the 184-seat theater, lobby and supporting spaces. In the theater, a high-ceilinged black-box space with a 42 x 30 foot sprung floor abuts a steeply-raked fixed seating area on one side. When describing a similar theater layout in Dance Theater Workshop's original building, former DTW Executive Director David R. White characterized this configuration as \"a formal, frontal black box theater.\" The second level of the building is devoted to offices and meeting rooms. The third level features two 1,200 square-foot windowed rehearsal studios, also with sprung floors, that can be combined to create a single space. This level also has two changing areas with lockers, showers and bathrooms.\n\nNotes\n"}

{"id": "142758", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=142758", "title": "Pied Piper of Hamelin", "text": "Pied Piper of Hamelin\n\nThe Pied Piper of Hamelin (, also known as the Pan Piper or the Rat-Catcher of Hamelin) is the titular character of a legend from the town of Hamelin (Hameln), Lower Saxony, Germany. The legend dates back to the Middle Ages, the earliest references describing a piper, dressed in multicolored (\"pied\") clothing, who was a rat-catcher hired by the town to lure rats away with his magic pipe. When the citizens refuse to pay for this service, he retaliates by using his instrument's magical power on their children, leading them away as he had the rats. This version of the story spread as folklore and has appeared in the writings of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, the Brothers Grimm, and Robert Browning, among others.\n\nThere are many contradictory theories about the Pied Piper. Some suggest he was a symbol of hope to the people of Hamelin, which had been attacked by plague; he drove the rats from Hamelin, saving the people from the epidemic.\n\nThe earliest known record of this story is from the town of Hamelin itself, depicted in a stained glass window created for the church of Hamelin, which dates to around 1300. Although the church was destroyed in 1660, several written accounts of the tale have survived.\n\nIn 1284, while the town of Hamelin was suffering from a rat infestation, a piper dressed in multicolored (\"pied\") clothing appeared, claiming to be a rat-catcher. He promised the mayor a solution to their problem with the rats. The mayor, in turn, promised to pay him for the removal of the rats. (According to some versions of the story, the promised sum was 1000 guilders.) The piper accepted and played his pipe to lure the rats into the Weser River, where all but one, which was deaf, drowned.\n\nDespite the piper's success, the mayor reneged on his promise and refused to pay him the full sum (reputedly reduced to a sum of 50 guilders) even going so far as to blame the piper for bringing the rats himself in an extortion attempt. Enraged, the piper stormed out of the town, vowing to return later to take revenge. On Saint John and Paul's day, while the adults were in church, the piper returned dressed in green like a hunter playing his pipe. In so doing, he attracted the town's children. A hundred and thirty children followed him out of town and into a cave and were never seen again. Depending on the version, at most three children remained behind: one was lame and could not follow quickly enough, the second was deaf and therefore could not hear the music, and the last was blind and unable to see where he was going. These three informed the villagers of what had happened when they came out from church.\n\nOther versions relate that the Pied Piper led the children to the top of Koppelberg Hill, where he took them to a beautiful land, or a place called Koppenberg Mountain, or Transylvania, or that he made them walk into the Weser as he did with the rats, and they all drowned. Some versions state that the Piper returned the children after payment, or that he returned the children after the villagers paid several times the original amount of gold.\n\nThe earliest mention of the story seems to have been on a stained-glass window placed in the Church of Hamelin c. 1300. The window was described in several accounts between the 14th and 17th centuries. It was destroyed in 1660. Based on the surviving descriptions, a modern reconstruction of the window has been created by historian Hans Dobbertin. It features the colorful figure of the Pied Piper and several figures of children dressed in white.\n\nThis window is generally considered to have been created in memory of a tragic historical event for the town. Also, Hamelin town records start with this event. The earliest written record is from the town chronicles in an entry from 1384 which states: \"It is 100 years since our children left.\"\n\nAlthough research has been conducted for centuries, no explanation for the historical event is universally accepted as true. In any case, the rats were first added to the story in a version from c. 1559 and are absent from earlier accounts.\n\nA number of theories suggest that children died of some natural causes such as disease or starvation and that the Piper was a symbolic figure of Death. Analogous themes which are associated with this theory include the Dance of Death, \"Totentanz\" or \"Danse Macabre\", a common medieval trope. Some of the scenarios that have been suggested as fitting this theory include that the children drowned in the river Weser, were killed in a landslide or contracted some disease during an epidemic. Another modern interpretation reads the story as alluding to an event where Hamelin children were lured away by a pagan or heretic sect to forests near Coppenbrügge (the mysterious \"Koppen\" \"hills\" of the poem) for ritual dancing where they all perished during a sudden landslide or collapsing sinkhole.\n\nAdded speculation on the migration is based on the idea that by the 13th century the area had too many people resulting in the oldest son owning all the land and power (majorat), leaving the rest as serfs. It has also been suggested that one reason the emigration of the children was never documented was that the children were sold to a recruiter from the Baltic region of Eastern Europe, a practice that was not uncommon at the time. In her essay \"Pied Piper Revisited\", Sheila Harty states that surnames from the region settled are similar to those from Hamelin and that selling off illegitimate children, orphans or other children the town could not support is the more likely explanation. She states further that this may account for the lack of records of the event in the town chronicles. In his book \"The Pied Piper: A Handbook\", Wolfgang Mieder states that historical documents exist showing that people from the area including Hamelin did help settle parts of Transylvania. Transylvania had suffered under lengthy Mongol invasions of Central Europe, led by two grandsons of Genghis Khan and which date from around the time of the earliest appearance of the legend of the piper, the early 13th century.\n\nIn the version of the legend posted on the official website for the town of Hamelin, another aspect of the emigration theory is presented:\n\nAmong the various interpretations, reference to the colonization of East Europe starting from Low Germany is the most plausible one: The \"Children of Hameln\" would have been in those days citizens willing to emigrate being recruited by landowners to settle in Moravia, East Prussia, Pomerania or in the Teutonic Land. It is assumed that in past times all people of a town were referred to as \"children of the town\" or \"town children\" as is frequently done today. The \"Legend of the children's Exodus\" was later connected to the \"Legend of expelling the rats\". This most certainly refers to the rat plagues being a great threat in the medieval milling town and the more or less successful professional \"rat catchers\".\n\nHistorian Ursula Sautter, citing the work of linguist Jürgen Udolph, offers this hypothesis in support of the emigration theory:\n\n\"After the defeat of the Danes at the Battle of Bornhöved in 1227,\" explains Udolph, \"the region south of the Baltic Sea, which was then inhabited by Slavs, became available for colonization by the Germans.\" The bishops and dukes of Pomerania, Brandenburg, Uckermark and Prignitz sent out glib \"locators,\" medieval recruitment officers, offering rich rewards to those who were willing to move to the new lands. Thousands of young adults from Lower Saxony and Westphalia headed east. And as evidence, about a dozen Westphalian place names show up in this area. Indeed there are five villages called Hindenburg running in a straight line from Westphalia to Pomerania, as well as three eastern Spiegelbergs and a trail of etymology from Beverungen south of Hamelin to Beveringen northwest of Berlin to Beweringen in modern Poland.\nUdolph favors the hypothesis that the Hamelin youths wound up in what is now Poland. Genealogist Dick Eastman cited Udolph's research on Hamelin surnames that have shown up in Polish phonebooks:\n\nLinguistics professor Jürgen Udolph says that 130 children did vanish on a June day in the year 1284 from the German village of Hamelin (\"Hameln\" in German). Udolph entered all the known family names in the village at that time and then started searching for matches elsewhere. He found that the same surnames occur with amazing frequency in the regions of Prignitz and Uckermark, both north of Berlin. He also found the same surnames in the former Pomeranian region, which is now a part of Poland.\n\nUdolph surmises that the children were actually unemployed youths who had been sucked into the German drive to colonize its new settlements in Eastern Europe. The Pied Piper may never have existed as such, but, says the professor, \"There were characters known as \"lokators\" who roamed northern Germany trying to recruit settlers for the East.\" Some of them were brightly dressed, and all were silver-tongued.\n\nProfessor Udolph can show that the Hamelin exodus should be linked with the Battle of Bornhöved in 1227 which broke the Danish hold on Eastern Europe. That opened the way for German colonization, and by the latter part of the thirteenth century there were systematic attempts to bring able-bodied youths to Brandenburg and Pomerania. The settlement, according to the professor's name search, ended up near Starogard in what is now northwestern Poland. A village near Hamelin, for example, is called Beverungen and has an almost exact counterpart called Beveringen, near Pritzwalk, north of Berlin and another called Beweringen, near Starogard.\n\nLocal Polish telephone books list names that are not the typical Slavic names one would expect in that region. Instead, many of the names seem to be derived from German names that were common in the village of Hamelin in the thirteenth century. In fact, the names in today's Polish telephone directories include Hamel, Hamler and Hamelnikow, all apparently derived from the name of the original village.\nDecan Lude of Hamelin was reported c. 1384, to have in his possession a chorus book containing a Latin verse giving an eyewitness account of the event.\n\nThe Lüneburg manuscript (c. 1440–50) gives an early German account of the event, rendered in the following form in an inscription on a house in Hamelin:\n\nAccording to author Fanny Rostek-Lühmann this is the oldest surviving account. \"Koppen\" (High German \"Kuppe\", meaning a knoll or domed hill) seems to be a reference to one of several hills surrounding Hamelin. Which of them was intended by the manuscript's author remains uncertain.\n\nSomewhere between 1559 and 1565, Count Froben Christoph von Zimmern included a version in his \"Zimmerische Chronik\". This appears to be the earliest account which mentions the plague of rats. Von Zimmern dates the event only as \"several hundred years ago\" (\"vor etlichen hundert jarn\" ), so that his version throws no light on the conflict of dates (see next paragraph). Another contemporary account is that of Johann Weyer in his \"De praestigiis daemonum\" (1563).\n\nSome theories have linked the disappearance of the children to mass psychogenic illness in the form of dancing mania. Dancing mania outbreaks occurred during the 13th century, including one in 1237 in which a large group of children travelled from Erfurt to Arnstadt (about 20 km), jumping and dancing all the way, in marked similarity to the legend of the Pied Piper of Hamelin, which originated at around the same time.\n\nOthers have suggested that the children left Hamelin to be part of a pilgrimage, a military campaign, or even a new Children's crusade (which is said to have occurred in 1212) but never returned to their parents. These theories see the unnamed Piper as their leader or a recruiting agent. The townspeople made up this story (instead of recording the facts) to avoid the wrath of the church or the king.\n\nWilliam Manchester's \"A World Lit Only by Fire\" places the events in 1484, 100 years after the written mention in the town chronicles that \"It is 100 years since our children left\", and further proposes that the Pied Piper was a psychopathic paedophile, although for the time period it is highly improbable that one man could abduct so many children undetected. Furthermore, nowhere in the book does Manchester offer proof of his description of the facts as he presents them. He makes similar assertions regarding other legends, also without supporting evidence.\n\n\nIn linguistics, \"pied-piping\" is the common name for the ability of question words and relative pronouns to drag other words along with them when brought to the front, as part of the phenomenon called Wh-movement. For example, in \"For whom are the pictures?\", the word \"for\" is \"pied-piped\" by \"whom\" away from its declarative position (\"The pictures are for me\"), and in \"The mayor, pictures of whom adorn his office walls\" both words \"pictures of\" are pied-piped in front of the relative pronoun, which normally starts the relative clause.\n\nSome researchers believe that the tale has inspired the common English phrase \"pay the piper\", although the phrase is actually a contraction of the English proverb \"he who pays the piper calls the tune\" which simply means that the person paying for something is the one who gets to say how it should be done.\n\nThe present-day City of Hamelin continues to maintain information about the Pied Piper legend and possible origins of the story on its website. Interest in the city's connection to the story remains so strong that in 2009, Hamelin held a tourist festival to mark the 725th anniversary of the disappearance of the town's earlier children. The eerie nature of such a celebration was enough to warrant an article in the \"Fortean Times\", a print magazine devoted to odd occurrences, legends, cryptozoology and all things strange which are known now as Forteana The article noted that even to this day, there is prohibition against playing music or dancing upon the Bungelosenstrasse (\"street without drums\"), the street where the children were purported to have last been seen before they disappeared or left the town. The Rat Catcher's House is popular with visitors, although it bears no connection to the Rat-Catcher version of the legend. Indeed, the Rattenfängerhaus is instead, associated with the story due to the earlier inscription upon its facade mentioning the legend. The house was built much later in 1602 and 1603. It is now a Hamelin City-owned restaurant with a pied piper theme throughout. The city also maintains an online shop with rat-themed merchandise as well as offering an officially licensed Hamelin Edition of the popular board game Monopoly which depicts the legendary Piper on the cover.\n\nIn addition to the recent milestone festival, each year the city marks June 26 as \"Rat Catcher's Day\". In the United States, a similar holiday for Exterminators based on Rat Catcher's Day has failed to catch on and is marked on July 22.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23603", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23603", "title": "Postmodernism", "text": "Postmodernism\n\nPostmodernism is a broad movement that developed in the mid- to late-20th century across philosophy, the arts, architecture, and criticism and that marked a departure from modernism. The term has also more generally been applied to the historical era following modernity and the tendencies of this era. (In this context, \"modern\" is not used in the sense of \"contemporary\", but merely as a name for a specific period in history.)\nWhile encompassing a wide variety of approaches, postmodernism is generally defined by an attitude of skepticism, irony, or rejection toward the meta-narratives and ideologies of modernism, often calling into question various assumptions of Enlightenment rationality. Consequently, common targets of postmodern critique include universalist notions of objective reality, morality, truth, human nature, reason, language, and social progress. Postmodern thinkers frequently call attention to the contingent or socially-conditioned nature of knowledge claims and value systems, situating them as products of particular political, historical, or cultural discourses and hierarchies. Accordingly, postmodern thought is broadly characterized by tendencies to self-referentiality, epistemological and moral relativism, pluralism, subjectivism, and irreverence.\n\nPostmodern critical approaches gained purchase in the 1980s and 1990s, and have been adopted in a variety of academic and theoretical disciplines, including cultural studies, philosophy of science, economics, linguistics, architecture, feminist theory, and literary criticism, as well as art movements in fields such as literature and music. Postmodernism is often associated with schools of thought such as deconstruction and post-structuralism, as well as philosophers such as Jean-François Lyotard, Jacques Derrida, and Fredric Jameson. Some philosophers have criticized the term.\n\nPostmodernism arose after World War II as a reaction to the perceived failings of modernism, whose radical artistic projects had come to be associated with totalitarianism or had been assimilated into mainstream culture. The basic features of what is now called postmodernism can be found as early as the 1940s, most notably in the work of artists such as Jorge Luis Borges. However, most scholars today would agree that postmodernism began to compete with modernism in the late 1950s and gained ascendancy over it in the 1960s. Since then, postmodernism has been a dominant, though not undisputed, force in art, literature, film, music, drama, architecture, history, and continental philosophy.\n\nSalient features of postmodernism are normally thought to include the ironic play with styles, citations and narrative levels, a metaphysical skepticism or nihilism towards a \"grand narrative\" of Western culture, a preference for the virtual at the expense of the Real (or more accurately, a fundamental questioning of what 'the real' constitutes) and a \"waning of affect\" on the part of the subject, who is caught up in the free interplay of virtual, endlessly reproducible signs inducing a state of consciousness similar to schizophrenia.\n\nSince the late 1990s there has been a small but growing feeling both in popular culture and in academia that postmodernism \"has gone out of fashion\".\n\nStructuralism was a philosophical movement developed by French academics in the 1950s, partly in response to French Existentialism. It has been seen variously as an expression of Modernism, High modernism, or postmodernism . \"Post-structuralists\" were thinkers who moved away from the strict interpretations and applications of structuralist ideas. Many American academics consider post-structuralism to be part of the broader, less well-defined postmodernist movement, even though many post-structuralists insisted it was not. Thinkers who have been called structuralists include the anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss, the linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, the Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser, and the semiotician Algirdas Greimas. The early writings of the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan and the literary theorist Roland Barthes have also been called structuralists. Those who began as structuralists but became post-structuralists include Michel Foucault, Roland Barthes, Jean Baudrillard, Gilles Deleuze. Other post-structuralists include Jacques Derrida, Pierre Bourdieu, Jean-François Lyotard, Julia Kristeva, Hélène Cixous, and Luce Irigaray. The American cultural theorists, critics and intellectuals whom they influenced include Judith Butler, John Fiske, Rosalind Krauss, Avital Ronell, and Hayden White.\n\nPost-structuralism is not defined by a set of shared axioms or methodologies, but by an emphasis on how various aspects of a particular culture, from its most ordinary, everyday material details to its most abstract theories and beliefs, determine one another. Post-structuralist thinkers reject Reductionism and Epiphenomenalism and the idea that cause-and-effect relationships are top-down or bottom-up. Like structuralists, they start from the assumption that people's identities, values and economic conditions determine each other rather than having \"intrinsic\" properties that can be understood in isolation. Thus the French structuralists considered themselves to be espousing Relativism and Constructionism. But they nevertheless tended to explore how the subjects of their study might be described, reductively, as a set of \"essential\" relationships, schematics, or mathematical symbols. (An example is Claude Lévi-Strauss's algebraic formulation of mythological transformation in \"The Structural Study of Myth\"). Post-structuralists thinkers went further, questioning the existence of any distinction between the nature of a thing and its relationship to other things.\n\nPostmodernist ideas in philosophy and the analysis of culture and society expanded the importance of critical theory and has been the point of departure for works of literature, architecture, and design, as well as being visible in marketing/business and the interpretation of history, law and culture, starting in the late 20th century. These developments—re-evaluation of the entire Western value system (love, marriage, popular culture, shift from industrial to service economy) that took place since the 1950s and 1960s, with a peak in the Social Revolution of 1968—are described with the term \"postmodernity\", as opposed to \"Postmodernism\", a term referring to an opinion or movement. Postmodernism has also been used interchangeably with the term post-structuralism out of which postmodernism grew; a proper understanding of postmodernism or doing justice to the postmodernist concept demands an understanding of the post-structuralist movement and the ideas of its advocates. Post-structuralism resulted similarly to postmodernism by following a time of structuralism. It is characterized by new ways of thinking through structuralism, contrary to the original form. \"Postmodernist\" describes part of a movement; \"Postmodern\" places it in the period of time since the 1950s, making it a part of contemporary history.\n\nOne of the most well-known postmodernist concerns is \"deconstruction,\" a theory for philosophy, literary criticism, and textual analysis developed by Jacques Derrida. The notion of a \"deconstructive\" approach implies an analysis that questions the already evident understanding of a text in terms of presuppositions, ideological underpinnings, hierarchical values, and frames of reference. A deconstructive approach further depends on the techniques of close reading without reference to cultural, ideological, moral opinions or information derived from an authority over the text such as the author. At the same time Derrida famously writes: \"Il n'y a pas d'hors-texte (\"there is no such thing as outside-of-the-text\").\" Derrida implies that the world follows the grammar of a text undergoing its own deconstruction. Derrida's method frequently involves recognizing and spelling out the different, yet similar interpretations of the meaning of a given text and the problematic implications of binary oppositions within the meaning of a text. Derrida's philosophy inspired a postmodern movement called deconstructivism among architects, characterized by the intentional fragmentation, distortion, and dislocation of architectural elements in designing a building. Derrida discontinued his involvement with the movement after the publication of his collaborative project with architect Peter Eisenman in \"Chora L Works: Jacques Derrida and Peter Eisenman\".\n\nThe connection between postmodernism, posthumanism, and cyborgism has led to a challenge of postmodernism, for which the terms \"postpostmodernism\" and \"postpoststructuralism\" were first coined in 2003:\n\nMore recently metamodernism, post-postmodernism and the \"death of postmodernism\" have been widely debated: in 2007 Andrew Hoberek noted in his introduction to a special issue of the journal \"Twentieth Century Literature\" titled \"After Postmodernism\" that \"declarations of postmodernism's demise have become a critical commonplace\". A small group of critics has put forth a range of theories that aim to describe culture or society in the alleged aftermath of postmodernism, most notably Raoul Eshelman (performatism), Gilles Lipovetsky (hypermodernity), Nicolas Bourriaud (altermodern), and Alan Kirby (digimodernism, formerly called pseudo-modernism). None of these new theories and labels have so far gained very widespread acceptance. Sociocultural anthropologist Nina Müller-Schwarze offers neostructuralism as a possible direction. The exhibition \"Postmodernism – Style and Subversion 1970–1990\" at the Victoria and Albert Museum (London, 24 September 2011 – 15 January 2012) was billed as the first show to document postmodernism as a historical movement.\n\nThe term \"postmodern\" was first used around the 1880s. John Watkins Chapman suggested \"a Postmodern style of painting\" as a way to depart from French Impressionism. J. M. Thompson, in his 1914 article in \"The Hibbert Journal\" (a quarterly philosophical review), used it to describe changes in attitudes and beliefs in the critique of religion, writing: \"The raison d'être of Post-Modernism is to escape from the double-mindedness of Modernism by being thorough in its criticism by extending it to religion as well as theology, to Catholic feeling as well as to Catholic tradition.\"\n\nIn 1921 and 1925, postmodernism had been used to describe new forms of art and music. In 1942 H. R. Hays described it as a new literary form. However, as a general theory for a historical movement it was first used in 1939 by Arnold J. Toynbee: \"Our own Post-Modern Age has been inaugurated by the general war of 1914–1918\".\n\nIn 1949 the term was used to describe a dissatisfaction with modern architecture, and led to the postmodern architecture movement, and a response to the modernist architectural movement known as the International Style. Postmodernism in architecture was initially marked by a re-emergence of surface ornament, reference to surrounding buildings in urban settings, historical reference in decorative forms (eclecticism), and non-orthogonal angles.\n\nPeter Drucker suggested the transformation into a post-modern world happened between 1937 and 1957 (when he was writing). He described an as yet \"nameless era\" which he characterized as a shift to conceptual world based on pattern, purpose, and process rather than mechanical cause, outlined by four new realities: the emergence of Educated Society, the importance of international development, the decline of the nation state, and the collapse of the viability of non-Western cultures.\n\nIn 1971, in a lecture delivered at the Institute of Contemporary Art, London, Mel Bochner described \"post-modernism\" in art as having started with Jasper Johns, \"who first rejected sense-data and the singular point-of-view as the basis for his art, and treated art as a critical investigation\".\n\nIn 1996, Walter Truett Anderson described postmodernism as belonging to one of four typological world views, which he identifies as either (a) Postmodern-ironist, which sees truth as socially constructed, (b) Scientific-rational, in which truth is found through methodical, disciplined inquiry, (c) Social-traditional, in which truth is found in the heritage of American and Western civilization, or (d) Neo-Romantic, in which truth is found through attaining harmony with nature and/or spiritual exploration of the inner self.\n\nMartin Heidegger rejected the philosophical basis of the concepts of \"subjectivity\" and \"objectivity\" and asserted that similar grounding oppositions in logic ultimately refer to one another. Instead of resisting the admission of this paradox in the search for understanding, Heidegger requires that we embrace it through an active process of elucidation he called the \"hermeneutic circle\". He stressed the historicity and cultural construction of concepts while simultaneously advocating the necessity of an atemporal and immanent apprehension of them. In this vein, he asserted that it was the task of contemporary philosophy to recover the original question of (or \"openness to\") \"Dasein\" (translated as Being or Being-there) present in the Presocratic philosophers but normalized, neutered, and standardized since Plato. This was to be done, in part, by tracing the record of \"Dasein's\" sublimation or forgetfulness through the history of philosophy which meant that we were to ask again what constituted the grounding conditions in ourselves and in the World for the affinity between beings and between the many usages of the term \"being\" in philosophy. To do this, however, a non-historical and, to a degree, self-referential engagement with whatever set of ideas, feelings or practices would permit (both the non-fixed concept and reality of) such a continuity was required—a continuity permitting the possible experience, possible existence indeed not only of beings but of all differences as they appeared and tended to develop.\n\nSuch a conclusion led Heidegger to depart from the phenomenology of his teacher Husserl and prompt instead an (ironically anachronistic) return to the yet-unasked questions of Ontology, a return that in general did not acknowledge an intrinsic distinction between phenomena and noumena or between things in themselves (\"de re\") and things as they appear (see qualia): Being-in-the-world, or rather, the openness to the process of \"Dasein\"'s becoming was to bridge the age-old gap between these two. In this latter premise, Heidegger shares an affinity with the late Romantic philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche, another principal forerunner of post-structuralist and postmodernist thought. Influential to thinkers associated with Postmodernism are Heidegger's critique of the subject–object or sense–knowledge division implicit in Rationalism, Empiricism, and methodological naturalism, his repudiation of the idea that facts exist outside or separately from the process of thinking and speaking them (however, Heidegger is not specifically a nominalist), his related admission that the possibilities of philosophical and scientific discourse are wrapped up in the practices and expectations of a society and that concepts and fundamental constructs are the expression of a lived, historical exercise rather than simple derivations of external, \"a priori\" conditions independent from historical mind and changing experience (see Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Heinrich von Kleist, Weltanschauung, and social constructionism), and his instrumentalist and negativist notion that Being (and, by extension, reality) is an action, method, tendency, possibility, and question rather than a discrete, positive, identifiable state, answer, or entity (see also process philosophy, dynamism, Instrumentalism, Pragmatism, and Vitalism).\n\nJacques Derrida re-examined the fundamentals of writing and its consequences on philosophy in general; sought to undermine the language of \"presence\" or metaphysics in an analytical technique which, beginning as a point of departure from Heidegger's notion of \"Destruktion\", came to be known as Deconstruction. Derrida used, like Heidegger, references to Greek philosophical notions associated with the Skeptics and the Presocratics, such as Epoché and Aporia to articulate his notion of implicit circularity between premises and conclusions, origins and manifestations, but—in a manner analogous in certain respects to Gilles Deleuze—presented a radical re-reading of canonical philosophical figures such as Plato, Aristotle, and Descartes as themselves being informed by such \"destabilizing\" notions.\n\nMichel Foucault introduced concepts such as 'discursive regime', or re-invoked those of older philosophers like 'episteme' and 'genealogy' in order to explain the relationship between meaning, power, and social behavior within social orders (see \"The Order of Things\", \"The Archaeology of Knowledge\", \"Discipline and Punish\", and \"The History of Sexuality\"). In direct contradiction to what have been typified as modernist perspectives on epistemology, Foucault asserted that rational judgment, social practice, and what he called \"biopower\" are not only inseparable but co-determinant. While Foucault himself was deeply involved in a number of progressive political causes and maintained close personal ties with members of the far-left, he was also controversial with leftist thinkers of his day, including those associated with various Marxist tendencies, proponents of left-libertarianism (such as Noam Chomsky), and supporters of humanism (like Jürgen Habermas), for his rejection of what he deemed to be Enlightenment concepts of freedom, liberation, self-determination, and human nature. Instead, Foucault focused on the ways in which such constructs can foster cultural hegemony, violence, and exclusion.\n\nIn line with his rejection of such \"positive\" tenets of Enlightenment-era humanism, he was active—with Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari—in the anti-psychiatry movement, considering much of institutionalized psychiatry and, in particular, Freud's concept of repression central to Psychoanalysis (which was still very influential in France during the 1960s and 1970s), to be both harmful and misplaced. Foucault was known for his controversial aphorisms, such as \"language is oppression\", meaning that language functions in such a way as to render nonsensical, false, or silent tendencies that might otherwise threaten or undermine the distributions of power backing a society's conventions—even when such distributions purport to celebrate liberation and expression or value minority groups and perspectives. His writings have had a major influence on the larger body of postmodern academic literature.\n\nJean-François Lyotard identified in \"The Postmodern Condition\" a crisis in the \"discourses of the human sciences\" latent in modernism but catapulted to the fore by the advent of the \"computerized\" or \"telematic\" era (see information revolution). This crisis, insofar as it pertains to academia, concerns both the motivations and justification procedures for making research claims: unstated givens or values that have validated the basic efforts of academic research since the late 18th century might no longer be valid—particularly, in social science and humanities research, though examples from mathematics are given by Lyotard as well. As formal conjecture about real-world issues becomes inextricably linked to automated calculation, information storage, and retrieval, such knowledge becomes increasingly \"exteriorised\" from its knowers in the form of information. Knowledge thus becomes materialized and made into a commodity exchanged between producers and consumers; it ceases to be either an idealistic end-in-itself or a tool capable of bringing about liberty or social benefit; it is stripped of its humanistic and spiritual associations, its connection with education, teaching, and human development, being simply rendered as \"data\"—omnipresent, material, unending, and without any contexts or pre-requisites. Furthermore, the \"diversity\" of claims made by various disciplines begins to lack any unifying principle or intuition as objects of study become more and more specialized due to the emphasis on specificity, precision, and uniformity of reference that competitive, database-oriented research implies.\n\nThe value-premises upholding academic research have been maintained by what Lyotard considers to be quasi-mythological beliefs about human purpose, human reason, and human progress—large, background constructs he calls \"metanarratives\". These metanarratives still remain in Western society but are now being undermined by rapid Informatization and the commercialization of the university and its functions. The shift of authority from the presence and intuition of knowers—from the good faith of reason to seek diverse knowledge integrated for human benefit or truth fidelity—to the automated database and the market had, in Lyotard's view, the power to unravel the very idea of \"justification\" or \"legitimation\" and, with it, the rationale for research altogether, especially in disciplines pertaining to human life, society, and meaning. We are now controlled not by binding extra-linguistic value paradigms defining notions of collective identity and ultimate purpose, but rather by our automatic responses to different species of \"language games\" (a concept Lyotard imports from J. L. Austin's theory of speech acts). In his vision of a solution to this \"vertigo\", Lyotard opposes the assumptions of universality, consensus, and generality that he identified within the thought of humanistic, Neo-Kantian philosophers like Jürgen Habermas, and proposes a continuation of experimentation and diversity to be assessed pragmatically in the context of language games rather than via appeal to a resurrected series of transcendentals and metaphysical unities.\n\nRichard Rorty argues in \"Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature\" that contemporary analytic philosophy mistakenly imitates scientific methods. In addition, he denounces the traditional epistemological perspectives of representationalism and correspondence theory that rely upon the independence of knowers and observers from phenomena and the passivity of natural phenomena in relation to consciousness. As a proponent of anti-foundationalism and anti-essentialism within a pragmatist framework, he echoes the postmodern strain of conventionalism and relativism, but opposes much of postmodern thinking with his commitment to social liberalism.\n\nJean Baudrillard, in \"Simulacra and Simulation\", introduced the concept that reality or the principle of \"The Real\" is short-circuited by the interchangeability of signs in an era whose communicative and semantic acts are dominated by electronic media and digital technologies. Baudrillard proposes the notion that, in such a state, where subjects are detached from the outcomes of events (political, literary, artistic, personal, or otherwise), events no longer hold any particular sway on the subject nor have any identifiable context; they therefore have the effect of producing widespread indifference, detachment, and passivity in industrialized populations. He claimed that a constant stream of appearances and references without any direct consequences to viewers or readers could eventually render the division between appearance and object indiscernible, resulting, ironically, in the \"disappearance\" of mankind in what is, in effect, a virtual or holographic state, composed only of appearances. For Baudrillard, \"simulation is no longer that of a territory, a referential being or a substance. It is the generation by models of a real without origin or a reality: a hyperreal.\"\n\nFredric Jameson set forth one of the first expansive theoretical treatments of postmodernism as a historical period, intellectual trend, and social phenomenon in a series of lectures at the Whitney Museum, later expanded as \"Postmodernism, or The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism\" (1991). Eclectic in his methodology, Jameson has continued a sustained examination of the role that periodization continues to play as a grounding assumption of critical methodologies in humanities disciplines. He has contributed extensive effort to explicating the importance of concepts of Utopia and Utopianism as driving forces in the cultural and intellectual movements of modernity, and outlining the political and existential uncertainties that may result from the decline or suspension of this trend in the theorized state of postmodernity. Like Susan Sontag, Jameson served to introduce a wide audience of American readers to key figures of the 20th century continental European intellectual left, particularly those associated with the Frankfurt School, structuralism, and post-structuralism. Thus, his importance as a \"translator\" of their ideas to the common vocabularies of a variety of disciplines in the Anglo-American academic complex is equally as important as his own critical engagement with them.\n\nIn \"Analysis of the Journey\", a journal birthed from postmodernism, Douglas Kellner insists that the \"assumptions and procedures of modern theory\" must be forgotten. His terms defined in the depth of postmodernism are based on advancement, innovation, and adaptation. Extensively, Kellner analyzes the terms of this theory in real-life experiences and examples. Kellner used science and technology studies as a major part of his analysis; he urged that the theory is incomplete without it. The scale was larger than just postmodernism alone; it must be interpreted through cultural studies where science and technology studies play a huge role. The reality of the September 11 attacks on the United States of America is the catalyst for his explanation. This catalyst is used as a great representation due to the mere fact of the planned ambush and destruction of \"symbols of globalization\", insinuating the World Trade Center.\n\nThe conclusion he depicts is simple: postmodernism, as most use it today, will decide what experiences and signs in one's reality will be one's reality as they know it.\n\nThe idea of Postmodernism in architecture began as a response to the perceived blandness and failed Utopianism of the Modern movement. Modern Architecture, as established and developed by Walter Gropius and Le Corbusier, was focused on the pursuit of a perceived ideal perfection, and attempted harmony of form and function, and dismissal of \"frivolous ornament,\" as well as arguing for an architecture that represented the spirit of the age as depicted in cutting-edge technology, be it airplanes, cars, ocean liners or even supposedly artless grain silos. Critics of modernism argued that the attributes of perfection and minimalism themselves were subjective, and pointed out anachronisms in modern thought and questioned the benefits of its philosophy. Definitive postmodern architecture such as the work of Michael Graves and Robert Venturi rejects the notion of a 'pure' form or 'perfect' architectonic detail, instead conspicuously drawing from all methods, materials, forms and colors available to architects.\n\nModernist Ludwig Mies van der Rohe is associated with the phrase \"less is more\"; in response Venturi famously said, \"Less is a bore.\" \n\nThe intellectual scholarship regarding postmodernism and architecture is closely linked with the writings of critic-turned-architect Charles Jencks, beginning with lectures in the early 1970s and his essay \"The rise of post-modern architecture\" from 1975. His \"magnum opus\", however, is the book \"The Language of Post-Modern Architecture\", first published in 1977, and since running to seven editions. Jencks makes the point that Post-Modernism (like Modernism) varies for each field of art, and that for architecture it is not just a reaction to Modernism but what he terms \"double coding\": \"Double Coding: the combination of Modern techniques with something else (usually traditional building) in order for architecture to communicate with the public and a concerned minority, usually other architects.\" Furthermore, Post-Modern architects would for economic reasons be compelled to make use of contemporary technology, hence distinguishing such architects from mere revivalists. Among the Post-Modern architects championed by Jencks were Robert Venturi, Robert Stern, Charles Moore, Michael Graves, Leon Krier, and James Stirling.\n\nPostmodernism is a rejection of 'totality', of the notion that planning could be 'comprehensive', widely applied regardless of context, and rational. In this sense, Postmodernism is a rejection of its predecessor: Modernism. From the 1920s onwards, the Modern movement sought to design and plan cities which followed the logic of the new model of industrial mass production; reverting to large-scale solutions, aesthetic standardisation and prefabricated design solutions (Goodchild 1990). Postmodernism also brought a break from the notion that planning and architecture could result in social reform, which was an integral dimension of the plans of Modernism (Simonsen 1990). Furthermore, Modernism eroded urban living by its failure to recognise differences and aim towards homogenous landscapes (Simonsen 1990, 57). Within Modernism, urban planning represented a 20th-century move towards establishing something stable, structured, and rationalised within what had become a world of chaos, flux and change (Irving 1993, 475). The role of planners predating Postmodernism was one of the 'qualified professional' who believed they could find and implement one single 'right way' of planning new urban establishments (Irving 1993). In fact, after 1945, urban planning became one of the methods through which capitalism could be managed and the interests of developers and corporations could be administered (Irving 1993, 479).\n\nConsidering Modernism inclined urban planning to treat buildings and developments as isolated, unrelated parts of the overall urban ecosystems created fragmented, isolated, and homogeneous urban landscapes (Goodchild, 1990). One of the greater problems with Modernist-style of planning was the disregard of resident or public opinion, which resulted in planning being forced upon the majority by a minority consisting of affluent professionals with little to no knowledge of real 'urban' problems characteristic of post-Second World War urban environments: slums, overcrowding, deteriorated infrastructure, pollution and disease, among others (Irving 1993). These were precisely the 'urban ills' Modernism was meant to 'solve', but more often than not, the types of 'comprehensive', 'one size fits all' approaches to planning made things worse., and residents began to show interest in becoming involved in decisions which had once been solely entrusted to professionals of the built environment. Advocacy planning and participatory models of planning emerged in the 1960s to counter these traditional elitist and technocratic approaches to urban planning (Irving 1993; Hatuka & D'Hooghe 2007). Furthermore, an assessment of the 'ills' of Modernism among planners during the 1960s, fuelled development of a participatory model that aimed to expand the range of participants in urban interventions (Hatuka & D'Hooghe 2007, 21).\n\nJane Jacobs' 1961 book \"The Death and Life of Great American Cities\" was a sustained critique of urban planning as it had developed within Modernism and marked a transition from modernity to postmodernity in thinking about urban planning (Irving 1993, 479). However, the transition from Modernism to Postmodernism is often said to have happened at 3:32pm on 15 July in 1972, when Pruitt Igoe; a housing development for low-income people in St. Louis designed by architect Minoru Yamasaki, which had been a prize-winning version of Le Corbusier's 'machine for modern living' was deemed uninhabitable and was torn down (Irving 1993, 480). Since then, Postmodernism has involved theories that embrace and aim to create diversity, and it exalts uncertainty, flexibility and change (Hatuka & D'Hooghe 2007). Postmodern planning aims to accept pluralism and heighten awareness of social differences in order to accept and bring to light the claims of minority and disadvantaged groups (Goodchild 1990). Urban planning discourse within Modernity and Postmodernity has developed in different contexts, even though they both grew within a capitalist culture. Modernity was shaped by a capitalist ethic of Fordist-Keynesian paradigm of mass, standardized production and consumption, while postmodernity was created out of a more flexible form of capital accumulation, labor markets and organisations (Irving 1993, 60). Also, there is a distinction between a postmodernism of 'reaction' and one of 'resistance'. A postmodernism of 'reaction' rejects Modernism and seeks to return to the lost traditions and history in order to create a new cultural synthesis, while Postmodernity of 'resistance' seeks to deconstruct Modernism and is a critique of the origins without necessarily returning to them (Irving 1993, 60). As a result of Postmodernism, planners are much less inclined to lay a firm or steady claim to there being one single 'right way' of engaging in urban planning and are more open to different styles and ideas of 'how to plan' (Irving 474).\n\nLiterary postmodernism was officially inaugurated in the United States with the first issue of \"boundary 2\", subtitled \"Journal of Postmodern Literature and Culture\", which appeared in 1972. David Antin, Charles Olson, John Cage, and the Black Mountain College school of poetry and the arts were integral figures in the intellectual and artistic exposition of postmodernism at the time. \"boundary 2\" remains an influential journal in postmodernist circles today.\n\nJorge Luis Borges' (1939) short story \"Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote\", is often considered as predicting postmodernism and conceiving the ideal of the ultimate parody. Samuel Beckett is sometimes seen as an important precursor and influence. Novelists who are commonly connected with postmodern literature include Vladimir Nabokov, William Gaddis, Umberto Eco, John Hawkes, William S. Burroughs, Giannina Braschi, Kurt Vonnegut, John Barth, Jean Rhys, Donald Barthelme, E.L. Doctorow, Richard Kalich, Jerzy Kosinski, Don DeLillo, Thomas Pynchon (Pynchon's work has also been described as \"high modern\"), Ishmael Reed, Kathy Acker, Ana Lydia Vega, Jachym Topol and Paul Auster.\n\nIn 1971, the Arab-American scholar Ihab Hassan published \"The Dismemberment of Orpheus: Toward a Postmodern Literature,\" an early work of literary criticism from a postmodern perspective, in which the author traces the development of what he calls \"literature of silence\" through Marquis de Sade, Franz Kafka, Ernest Hemingway, Beckett, and many others, including developments such as the Theatre of the Absurd and the nouveau roman. In 'Postmodernist Fiction' (1987), Brian McHale details the shift from modernism to postmodernism, arguing that the former is characterized by an epistemological dominant, and that postmodern works have developed out of modernism and are primarily concerned with questions of ontology. In \"Constructing Postmodernism\" (1992), McHale's second book, he provides readings of postmodern fiction and of some of the contemporary writers who go under the label of cyberpunk. McHale's \"What Was Postmodernism?\" (2007), follows Raymond Federman's lead in now using the past tense when discussing postmodernism.\n\nPostmodern music is either music of the postmodern era, or music that follows aesthetic and philosophical trends of postmodernism. As the name suggests, the postmodernist movement formed partly in reaction to the ideals of the modernist. Because of this, postmodern music is mostly defined in opposition to modernist music, and a work can either be modernist, or postmodern, but not both. Jonathan Kramer posits the idea (following Umberto Eco and Jean-François Lyotard) that postmodernism (including \"musical\" postmodernism) is less a surface style or historical period (i.e., condition) than an \"attitude\".\n\nThe postmodern impulse in classical music arose in the 1960s with the advent of musical minimalism. Composers such as Terry Riley, Henryk Górecki, Bradley Joseph, John Adams, Steve Reich, Philip Glass, Michael Nyman, and Lou Harrison reacted to the perceived elitism and dissonant sound of atonal academic modernism by producing music with simple textures and relatively consonant harmonies, whilst others, most notably John Cage challenged the prevailing narratives of beauty and objectivity common to Modernism. Some composers have been openly influenced by popular music and world ethnic musical traditions.\n\nPostmodern classical music as well is not a musical \"style\", but rather refers to music of the postmodern era. It bears the same relationship to postmodernist music that postmodernity bears to postmodernism. Postmodern music, on the other hand, shares characteristics with postmodernist art—that is, art that comes \"after\" and reacts \"against\" modernism.\n\nThough representing a general return to certain notions of music-making that are often considered to be classical or romantic, not all postmodern composers have eschewed the experimentalist or academic tenets of modernism. The works of Dutch composer Louis Andriessen, for example, exhibit experimentalist preoccupation that is decidedly anti-romantic. Eclecticism and freedom of expression, in reaction to the rigidity and aesthetic limitations of modernism, are the hallmarks of the postmodern influence in musical composition.\n\nAuthor on postmodernism, Dominic Strinati, has noted, it is also important \"to include in this category the so-called 'art rock' musical innovations and mixing of styles associated with groups like Talking Heads, and performers like Laurie Anderson, together with the self-conscious 'reinvention of disco' by the Pet Shop Boys\".\n\nGraphic design in the postmodern age brought forth ideas that challenged the orderly feel of modernism. Graphic designers created works beginning in the 1970s without any set adherence to rational order and formal organization. Designers began experimenting with how shapes, forms and typography could react with one another effectively and interestingly in a less rigid way even if the design was rendered illegible. Some graphic design styles that emerged in the postmodernist era were New Wave Typography, retro and vernacular design, playful design inspired by the Italian Memphis Group, punk rock styles and explorative digital design from the late 1980's. Another characteristic of postmodern graphic design is that \"retro, techno, punk, grunge, beach, parody, and pastiche were all conspicuous trends. Each had its own sites and venues, detractors and advocates\".\n\nYet, while postmodern design did not consist of one unified graphic style, the movement was an expressive and playful time for designers who searched for more and more ways to go against the system. Postmodernism did not seek rules but only creative solutions and innovative ideas. The clean orderly grid-based designs of International Typographic Style were interrupted for more exploration and innovation in color, composition, visual communication, and typography. Key influential postmodern graphic designers include Wolfgang Weingart, April Greiman, Jayme Odgers, Tibor Kalman, Dan Friedman, Paula Scher, Neville Brody, Michael Vanderbyl and Jamie Reid.\n\nCriticisms of postmodernism are intellectually diverse, including the assertions that postmodernism is meaningless and promotes obscurantism. For example, Noam Chomsky has argued that postmodernism is meaningless because it adds nothing to analytical or empirical knowledge. He asks why postmodernist intellectuals do not respond like people in other fields when asked, \"what are the principles of their theories, on what evidence are they based, what do they explain that wasn't already obvious, etc.?...If [these requests] can't be met, then I'd suggest recourse to Hume's advice in similar circumstances: 'to the flames'.\"\n\nChristian philosopher William Lane Craig has noted \"The idea that we live in a postmodern culture is a myth. In fact, a postmodern culture is an impossibility; it would be utterly unliveable. People are not relativistic when it comes to matters of science, engineering, and technology; rather, they are relativistic and pluralistic in matters of religion and ethics. But, of course, that's not postmodernism; that's modernism!\"\n\nFormal, academic critiques of postmodernism can also be found in works such as \"Beyond the Hoax\" and \"Fashionable Nonsense\".\n\nHowever, as for continental philosophy, American academics have tended to label it \"postmodernist\", especially practitioners of \"French Theory\". Such a trend might derive from U.S. departments of Comparative Literature. Félix Guattari, often considered a \"postmodernist\", rejected its theoretical assumptions by arguing that the structuralist and postmodernist visions of the world were not flexible enough to seek explanations in psychological, social and environmental domains at the same time.\n\nAnalytic philosopher Daniel Dennett declared, \"Postmodernism, the school of 'thought' that proclaimed 'There are no truths, only interpretations' has largely played itself out in absurdity, but it has left behind a generation of academics in the humanities disabled by their distrust of the very idea of truth and their disrespect for evidence, settling for 'conversations' in which nobody is wrong and nothing can be confirmed, only asserted with whatever style you can muster.\"\n\nDaniel A. Farber and Suzanna Sherry criticised Postmodernism for reducing the complexity of the modern world to an expression of power and for undermining truth and reason: \"If the modern era begins with the European Enlightenment, the postmodern era that captivates the radical multiculturalists begins with its rejection. According to the new radicals, the Enlightenment-inspired ideas that have previously structured our world, especially the legal and academic parts of it, are a fraud perpetrated and perpetuated by white males to consolidate their own power. Those who disagree are not only blind but bigoted. The Enlightenment's goal of an objective and reasoned basis for knowledge, merit, truth, justice, and the like is an impossibility: \"objectivity,\" in the sense of standards of judgment that transcend individual perspectives, does not exist. Reason is just another code word for the views of the privileged. The Enlightenment itself merely replaced one socially constructed view of reality with another, mistaking power for knowledge. There is naught but power.\"\n\nH. Sidky pointed out what he sees as several \"inherent flaws\" of a postmodern antiscience perspective, including the confusion of the authority of science (evidence) with the scientist conveying the knowledge; its self-contradictory claim that all truths are relative; and its strategic ambiguity. He sees 21st-century anti-scientific and pseudo-scientific approaches to knowledge, particularly in the United States, as rooted in a postmodernist \"decades-long academic assault on science:\" \"Many of those indoctrinated in postmodern anti-science went on to become conservative political and religious leaders, policymakers, journalists, journal editors, judges, lawyers, and members of city councils and school boards. Sadly, they forgot the lofty ideals of their teachers, except that science is bogus.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "492226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=492226", "title": "Power Rangers Dino Thunder", "text": "Power Rangers Dino Thunder\n\nPower Rangers Dino Thunder is an American children's television series, the twelfth season of the \"Power Rangers\" franchise.\nAs with all \"Power Rangers\" series, it was adapted from a series from the long running Japanese Super Sentai franchise, in this case the 27th entry, \"Bakuryū Sentai Abaranger\". \"Dino Thunder\" was also the subtitle of the Korean dub of \"Abaranger\" in South Korea and had a similar/identical logo to the American version as well.\nThe series is notable as it features the return of Jason David Frank to a starring role. This was the first season since \"\" to have an African American ranger back to the series due to production move from Los Angeles to New Zealand and shift to Non-SAG talent actors during the previous season. It was the first \"Power Rangers\" series to be aired on the new block, Jetix, and Toon Disney.\n\nA soccer player, a computer expert, a singer, an artist, and a teacher with a long history of such situations join forces to become Power Rangers and help save the Earth from the scheming of Mesogog, a dinosauric villain who wishes to eradicate all human life and return Earth to the age of dinosaurs.\n\nIn this season, Tommy Oliver, from \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\" to \"Power Rangers Turbo\" fame, returns as a paleontology professor in Reefside, California. When he is assigned three detention students, Conner, Ethan, and Kira, they end up finding the Dino Gems, paving the way for them to become the Dino Rangers. Conner gains the power of the Tyrannozord (based on the Tyrannosaurus), as well as super-speed; Ethan gains the power of the Tricerazord (based on the Triceratops), as well as the ability to make his skin invulnerable; and Kira gains the power of the Pterazord (based on the Pteranodon), as well as a sonic scream. Tommy (known often as Dr. O) himself once again becomes a Power Ranger by joining the team as the Black Dino Ranger with the power of invisibility, and they are also later joined by Trent Mercer as the White Dino Ranger, with the power of camouflage. Trent must deal with the inner struggle of good and evil, as Tommy himself once had to do as the evil Green Ranger, because he gained his powers from a raw Dino Gem in Mesogog's lab, with the powers originally intended to be Mesogog's. Mesogog is in fact, Trent's adopted father Anton Mercer, who, in a faulty lab experiment, began to mutate into Mesogog. Trent later sides with good and saves his father from the mutation.\n\nDuring the course of the series, the team adds the following to its arsenal of Zords: Cephalozord (based on the Pachycephalosaurus), Dimetrozord (based on the Dimetrodon), Stegozord (based on the Stegosaurus), Parasaurzord (based on the Parasaurolophus), and Ankylozord (based on the Ankylosaurus). The Stegozord later combines with Trent's zord, the Dragozord (based on the Tupuxuara), to form the Dino Stegozord. Tommy pilots the Brachiozord (based on the Brachiosaurus), the carrier for all the other Zords. Conner is also given the power to become the Triassic Ranger, and pilots the Mezodon Rover/Megazord (based on the Styracosaurus), which can combine with the Cephalo, Dimetro, Parasaur and Ankylozords to form the Triceramax Megazord.\n\nAt the end of the series, the Rangers destroy Mesogog with their raw Dino Gem power, but the gems are burned out in the process. Just before this, they are also forced to sacrifice all the Zords in their last battle with Zeltrax, one of Mesogog's strongest minions.Finally they return to their normal lives.\n\nDino Rangers\n\nAllies\n\nVillains\n\nSpecial Guest\n\nDue to the mention that Power Rangers solely existed as a comic book in \"Power Rangers Ninja Storm\", many fans believed that series existed in a different universe than that of the original Power Rangers series. (However, Power Rangers in Space had previously mentioned a Ranger-based comic book in its crossover with ). Fans also believed this due to the lack of a \"Ninja Storm\"/\"Wild Force\" team-up episode, partly due to the actors refusing to come since much of the production crew had been laid off as well as the change in hands of the Power Rangers franchise from Saban to Disney and filming locations from United States to New Zealand. Executive producer Douglas Sloan also received heavy criticism for not tying \"Ninja Storm\" in with the original universe.\n\nTo tie up all of the loose \"Ninja Storm\" ends, and to try to bring in a larger audience, Sloan brought back Jason David Frank and his original character, the once evil turned hero, green, white, red, and now black ranger from \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\" through \"Power Rangers Turbo\", Tommy Oliver, a legendary Power Ranger, as a mentor for the new team as well as a fellow Power Ranger. Jason Frank has said that he did the show as a favor for Sloan. Through the episodes \"Legacy of Power\" (the 500th episode overall), a look back on all of the previous Power Rangers series; \"Back in Black\", giving Tommy new Power Ranger powers; \"Fighting Spirit\", seeing Tommy encounter his previous Ranger forms and airing on the eleventh anniversary of \"Power Rangers\" no less; and \"Thunder Storm\", a team-up arc between \"Dino Thunder\" and \"Ninja Storm\", all previous series were included in the original Power Rangers universe.\n\nAlso in the season premiere \"Day of the Dino\", Mesogog knew of Lothor as he mentioned Reefside would believe he had returned to town, although Blue Bay Harbor was Lothor's target in Ninja Storm.\nHowever considering Conner's twin brother attended the Wind Ninja Academy it is possible the two towns are relatively nearby one another, explaining Mesogog's statement.\n\n\"Dino Thunder\" also was the first Power Rangers series to overtly acknowledge its Super Sentai roots with an episode entitled \"Lost and Found in Translation,\" which featured a Japanese show based on the Power Rangers dubbed in English. In actuality, the footage used in that episode was from episode 10 (\"Abare League Bind\") of \"Dino Thunder\"'s source series, \"Bakuryū Sentai Abaranger\", dubbed in a manner similar to the comedic parody dub of \"Kagaku Sentai Dynaman\" in the late 1980s.\n\nThere were two games produced for \"Dino Thunder\". On the Game Boy Advance, there was a sidescrolling game, which was a platformer involving fighting several villains from the series. The other game was produced for the PlayStation 2 and the Nintendo GameCube. This was the first Power Rangers game produced on a sixth generation console. All the action takes place inside the zords. This game also had some inconsistencies with the television series to allow the action to take place in the zords while battling the regular enemies who were human size.\n\nCurrently, 23 of the 38 episodes are available in various volumes on DVD in Region 1, whereas a complete box set was released in Region 2 on July 14, 2008. Shout! Factory has released the entire series as part of their \"Seasons 8 – 12\" DVD box set. The complete Region 1 season is now available individually as of October 2016. \n"}
{"id": "957837", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=957837", "title": "Princess and dragon", "text": "Princess and dragon\n\nPrincess and dragon is a generic premise common to many legends, fairy tales, and chivalric romances. Northrop Frye identified it as a central form of the quest romance.\n\nThe story involves an upper class woman, generally a princess or similar high-ranking nobility, saved from a dragon, either a literal dragon or a similar danger, by the virtuous hero (see Damsel in distress). She may be the first woman endangered by the peril, or may be the end of a long succession of women who were not of as high birth as she is, nor as fortunate. Normally the princess ends up married to the dragon-slayer.\n\nThe motifs of the hero who finds the princess about to be sacrificed to the dragon and saves her, the false hero who takes his place, and the final revelation of the true hero, are the identifying marks of the Aarne–Thompson folktale type 300, the Dragon-Slayer. They also appear in type 303, the Two Brothers. These two tales have been found, in different variants, in countries all over the world.\n\nThe \"princess and dragon\" scenario is given even more weight in popular imagination than it is in the original tales; the stereotypical hero is envisioned as slaying dragons even though, for instance, the Brothers Grimm had only a few tales of dragon and giant slayers among hundreds of tales.\n\nOne of the earliest example of the motif comes from the Ancient Greek tale of Perseus, who rescued the princess Andromeda from Cetus, a sea monster often described as resembling a serpent or dragon. This was taken up into other Greek myths, such as Heracles, who rescued the princess Hesione of Troy from a similar sea monster. Most ancient versions depicted the dragon as the expression of a god's wrath: in Andromeda's case, because her mother Cassiopeia had compared her beauty to that of the sea nymphs, and in Hesione's, because her father had reneged on a bargain with Poseidon. This is less common in fairy tales and other, later versions, where the dragon is frequently acting out of malice.\nThe Japanese legend of Yamata no Orochi also invokes this motif. The god Susanoo encounters two \"Earthly Deities\" who have been forced to sacrifice their seven daughters to the many-headed monster. Susanoo is able to kill the dragon after getting it drunk on sake (rice wine).\n\nAnother variation is from the tale of Saint George and the Dragon. The tale begins with a dragon making its nest at the spring which provides a city-state with water. Consequently, the citizens had to temporarily remove the dragon from its nest in order to collect water. To do so, they offered the dragon a daily human sacrifice. The victim of the day was chosen by drawing lots. Eventually in this lottery, the lot happened to fall to the local princess. The local monarch is occasionally depicted begging for her life with no result. She is offered to the dragon but at this point a traveling Saint George arrives. He faces and defeats the dragon and saves the princess; some versions claim that the dragon is not killed in the fight, but pacified once George ties the princess' sash around its neck. The grateful citizens then abandon their ancestral paganism and convert to Christianity.\n\nWhen the tale is not about a dragon but a troll, giant, or ogre, the princess is often a captive rather than about to be eaten, as in \"The Three Princesses of Whiteland\". These princesses are often a vital source of information to their rescuers, telling them how to perform tasks that the captor sets to them, or how to kill the monster, and when she does not know, as in \"The Giant Who Had No Heart in His Body\", she frequently can pry the information from the giant. Despite the hero's helplessness without this information, the princess is incapable of using the knowledge herself. \nAgain, if a false claimant intimidates her into silence about who actually killed the monster as in the fairy tale \"The Two Brothers\", when the hero appears, she will endorse his story, but she will not tell the truth prior to them; she often agrees to marry the false claimant in the hero's absence. The hero has often cut out the tongue of the dragon, so when the false hero cuts off its head, his claim to have killed it is refuted by its lack of a tongue; the hero produces the tongue and so proves his claim to marry the princess. In some tales, however, the princess herself takes steps to ensure that she can identify the hero—cutting off a piece of his cloak as in \"Georgic and Merlin\", giving him tokens as in \"The Sea-Maiden\"—and so separate him from the false hero.\n\nThis dragon-slaying hero appears in medieval romances about knights-errant, such as the Russian \"Dobrynya Nikitich\". In some variants of Tristan and Iseult, Tristan wins Iseult for his uncle, King Mark of Cornwall, by killing a dragon that was devastating her father's kingdom; he has to prove his claim when the king's steward claims to be the dragon-slayer. Ludovico Ariosto took the concept up into \"Orlando Furioso\" using it not once but twice: the rescue of Angelica by Ruggiero, and Orlando rescuing Olimpia. The monster that menaced Olimpia reconnected to the Greek myths; although Ariosto described it as a legend to the characters, the story was that the monster sprung from an offense against Proteus. In neither case did he marry the rescued woman to the rescuer. Edmund Spenser depicts St. George in \"The Faerie Queene\", but while Una is a princess who seeks aid against a dragon, and her depiction in the opening with a lamb fits the iconography of St. George pagents, the dragon imperils her parents' kingdom, and not her alone. Many tales of dragons, ending with the dragon-slayer marrying a princess, do not precisely fit this cliché because the princess is in no more danger than the rest of the threatened kingdom.\n\nAn unusual variant occurs in Child ballad 34, \"Kemp Owyne\", where the dragon \"is\" the maiden; the hero, based on Ywain from Arthurian legend, rescues her from the transformation with three kisses.\n\nIn \"Sleeping Beauty\", Walt Disney concluded the tale by having the wicked fairy godmother Maleficent transform herself into a dragon to withstand the prince, converting the fairy tale to one with the princess and dragon theme.\n\nIn Ian Fleming's \"Dr. No\", both the book and film versions feature a tank in the shape of a dragon that protects Dr. No's island from superstitious intruders. James Bond and Honeychile Rider are menaced by the dragon, do battle with it, have their friend Quarrel killed and are captured by the crew of the Dragon tank. Ann Boyd's 1967 book \"The Devil with James Bond\" explores the theory of the updating of the Princess and dragon genre.\n\nIn modern fantasy works, the dragon may hold the princess captive instead of eating her. Patricia Wrede spoofed this concept in \"Dealing with Dragons\".\n\nA subversion of the concept for young readers is Robert Munsch's \"The Paper Bag Princess\", in which a princess outwits a dragon to save a prince (her betrothed, whom she proceeds \"not\" to marry upon him insulting her makeshift clothing instead of thanking her).\n\nIn Jay Williams's tale \"The Practical Princess\", a dragon demands that a king should sacrifice his daughter to him so that he will leave the rest of the kingdom alone. But the princess saves herself by making a \"princess dummy\" out of straw, and filling it with boiling pitch and tar. The princess dresses the dummy in one of her own gowns, then goes to the dragon's cave where she offers herself as a sacrifice. The unwitting dragon swallows the straw dummy whole, and the pitch and tar explodes inside the dragon's stomach, killing him. Afterwards, the princess observes, \"Dragons are not very smart.\"\n\nIn the Isaac Asimov short story \"Prince Delightful and the Flameless Dragon\", it is revealed that Dragons used to be slain as part of a passage from princehood to adulthood, though after a while, they became a protected species. Contrary to popular myth, they don't eat princesses as they tend to smell of cheap perfume and give indigestion.\n\nIn some stories, mostly in more recent literary works, the cliche involving princesses and dragons is somehow twisted to create a more exciting or humorous effect. For example, in \"The Paper Bag Princess\", the princess came to realize that her prince was even more obnoxious than the dragon, and refused to go with him, preferring to skip off into the setting sun alone instead. In some versions, the princess may also befriend, tame, personally defeat, or even be turned into a dragon herself. Indeed, there are a few examples when a curse or spell transforms a princess into a dragon or similar creature (e.g. an alligator, giant bird, or fictional reptile species). In such stories, the transformed princess usually aids her sweetheart in a battle against a force of evil. In \"The Swan Princess\", for example, Princess Odette is transformed into a swan, and she helps her lover triumph in a battle against the sorcerer Rothbart, who has the power to transform himself into a hideous beast (a manifestation of a lion, wolf, and bear).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "237736", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=237736", "title": "Spelling bee", "text": "Spelling bee\n\nA spelling bee is a competition in which contestants are asked to spell a broad selection of words, usually with a varying degree of difficulty. The concept is thought to have originated in the United States, and spelling bee events, along with variants, are now also held in some other countries around the world.\nThe first winner of an official spelling bee was Frank Neuhauser, who won the 1st National Spelling Bee (now known as the Scripps National Spelling Bee) in Washington, D.C. in 1925 at age eleven.\n\nHistorically the word \"bee\" has been used to describe a get-together for communal work, like a husking bee, a quilting bee, or an apple bee. According to etymological research recorded in dictionaries, the word probably comes from dialectal \"been\" or \"bean\" (meaning \"help given by neighbors\"), which came from Middle English \"bene\" (meaning \"prayer\", \"boon\" and \"extra service by a tenant to his lord\").\n\nThe earliest known evidence of the phrase \"spelling bee\" in print dates back to 1850, although an earlier name, \"spelling match\", has been traced back to 1808. A key impetus for the contests was Noah Webster's spelling books. First published in 1786 and known colloquially as \"The Blue-backed Speller,\" Webster's spelling books were an essential part of the curriculum of all elementary school children in the United States for five generations. Now the key reference for the contests is the Webster's Third New International Dictionary.\n\nThe United States National Spelling Bee was started in 1925 by \"The Courier-Journal\", the newspaper of Louisville, Kentucky. In 1941, the Scripps Howard News Service acquired sponsorship of the program, and the name changed to the Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee (later simply \"Scripps National Spelling Bee\"). Besides competitors from the 50 U.S. states, several come from Canada, the Bahamas, New Zealand and European countries.\n\nIn the United States, spelling bees are annually held from local levels up to the level of the Scripps National Spelling Bee which awards a cash prize to the winner. The National Spelling Bee is sponsored by English-language newspapers and educational foundations; it is also broadcast on ESPN. Since 2006, the National Spelling Bee's championship rounds have been broadcast on ABC live. In 2005, contestants came from the Bahamas, Jamaica, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Canada, New Zealand, Puerto Rico and a German military base, as well as the United States. This was the first year that spellers from Canada and New Zealand attended the competition. The final authority for words is the \"Webster's Third New International Dictionary\". The annual study list is available from Scripps, either online or in print.\n\nThe National Senior Spelling Bee started in Cheyenne, Wyoming in 1996. Sponsored by the Wyoming AARP, it is open to contestants 50 and older. Maria Dawson is the only contestant to ever win two back-to-back titles at the National Senior Spelling Bee.\n\nThe South Asian Spelling Bee is another spelling bee platform in the US. This annual contest takes place across the US each summer in search of the next South Asian-American spelling champ between the ages of 8 and 14 years old. Launched in 2008, the South Asian Spelling Bee will tour 10 US cities in 2011 and is broadcast globally via the satellite channel, Sony Entertainment Television Asia.\n\nHolding spelling bees in English, with its irregular spelling, makes more sense than in languages that have much more regular spelling.\n\nIn Africa, a spelling bee is organized by the African Spelling Bee, which holds an Annual Spelling Bee contest for children between the age of 6 and 16 across the continent. The first competition took place in July 2016, bringing together nine different countries.\n\nThere are several countries that run their own national spelling bees, including Uganda which holds the National Spelling Bee organized by enjuba in 10 different languages, including 8 local languages, sign language and English.\n\nNigeria's spelling bee is called the Nigeria Spelling Bee organized by the Bee Spelling Competition Initiative in states across the federation of Nigeria.\n\nBotswana, Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Malawi, and Rwanda are also part of the African Spelling Bee with the number of countries still growing.\n\nIn Asia, a spelling bee is being conducted up to the international level by MaRRS Spelling Bee. The competition involves learning the correct spelling of words, their use insentences and in multiple contexts. Currently, it is being held in India, Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Bahrain, Dubai, Fujairah, Ras-al-Khaima, Sharjah, and Umm-Al-Quwain. Also in Bahrain, an annual spelling bee contest named \"Spellbound Bahrain\" is conducted for the school children by KEEN4, an association of Kerala Engineers.\n\nIn Malaysia, the annual NST-RHB Spell-it-Right Challenge is open to primary and secondary school students under the Malaysian education syllabus. The competition is carried out in three rounds: the Preliminary Challenge, State Challenge and National Challenge. The preliminary challenge is a written spelling test, from which the top 100 spellers will be chosen to compete in the State Challenge, where the competition is carried out orally. The 1st prize winner from this stage will then represent their states to compete for the title of National Spell-it-Right Champion in the National Challenge.\n\nIn Taiwan, the National Spelling Bee Championship is a contest held by Bugstation.tv for young English learners. Thousands of young applicants join this contest each year. Another organisation that promotes the love of the English language is Horizons Unlimited, which in 2011 organized an India Spelling Bee contest for children in the southern state of Kerala in India.\n\nThe annual Asia Spelling Cup is held in different cities throughout Asia, and uses mobile pre-selection testing to identify finalists.\n\nIn Western Australia, a spelling bee is held by the State Library Foundation of Western Australia, for children in school years 5, 6, 7 and 8. The early stages of the competition are held online, and the final spell-off in front of a live audience. Two major prizes are awarded: one for a Junior Winner (Years 5-6) and the other for a Senior Winner (Years 7-8). Further prizes are given to the teacher and school class of each major prize winner, and to the most improved speller each week.\n\nStarting in 2012, Bangladesh's English daily newspaper, The Daily Star and e-Learning portal Champs21 have been organizing a televised spelling bee on Channel i for the students of class six to ten from Bengali and English medium backgrounds, who compete through their schools and the Champs21 website. The spelling bee team visits 7 divisional cities (Dhaka, Chittagong, Sylhet, Rangpur, Rajshahi, Khulna & Barisal) to test top 1% speller and top 96 speller of the season participate in the television show. The competition is the first such arrangement in Bangladesh. The champion is rewarded with a trip to Washington, DC. The winners of season 2 met the honorable president of the People's Republic of Bangladesh Advocate Abdul Hamid.\n\nThe \"Postmedia Canspell National Spelling Bee\" is the only Scripps affiliated Canadian spelling bee held annually nationwide in Canada since 2005. The bee is affiliated with the United States-based Scripps National Spelling Bee and uses similar rules and word lists, and competes in all 10 Canadian provinces to provide a Canadian National Champion for the penultimate Scripps competition.\n\nIt should not be confused with another organization, calling itself the Spelling Bee of Canada, which started in 1987 in Toronto, Ontario, and is now celebrating its 25th anniversary, and hosting a Canadian Invitational Bee in 2012, as well as organizing Provincial Bees across Canada, and the world.\n\nIn the school year 2008–2009, Mrs. Wijdan Alawadhi (senior teacher) and Mrs. Mona Yehia (teacher of English) started the spelling bee contest in Mubarak al-Kabir Educational Area (one of the biggest Kuwaiti Governorates). They started the contest as an experiment contest in their school (Thabet Bin Zaid Primary School for Boys) with the fourth and fifth grades. It was a successful experiment which was faced with a lot of appreciation from Mrs. Aisha Al Awadhi, ELT Senior Supervisor of English Language supervision. Then they decided to hold the competition among the whole educational area (Mubarak Al-Kabeer Educational area). In 2010–2011, the contest was held with 27 schools (12 schools for boys and 15 for girls - around 2700 pupils). Each school nominated a pupil from the fifth grade to participate.\n\nIn 2012–2013, 30 schools participated. All the 30 pupils participated anxiously to win the competition with 200 words. It becomes officially an authorized contest in Mubarak Al-Kabeer Educational Area (Kuwaiti Spelling Bee) in Kuwait. In the school year 2013–2014 the competition was held in Al-Imam Al-Shafie primary school for boys with 31 schools and the words list contained 260 words.\n\nIn 2014–2015 with the patronage of Mr. Talaq Al-Hiem the director of Mubarak Al-Kabeer Educational Area the competition held with the participation of 33 schools (16 girls, 15 boys and 2 LD) in Sabah AL-Salem Primary school with the help of its principal Mrs. Amira Baqer. Mrs. Aisha Al-Awadhi and the success of the competition convinced the ELT General supervision to decide the competition as Kuwait National Spelling Bee for the coming year 2015–2016.\n\nThe Nigeria Spelling Bee is organized in across states of the federation with national finalists drawn after qualifying from their respective states and either of the 6 geo-political zones of the country. The Nigeria Spelling Bee which is the widest spelling bee competition in the country has so far been conducted in more than 25 states across Nigeria by the organizers (Bee Spelling Competition Initiative) which has been endorsed by the Federal Ministry of Education, Ministry of Culture and other states ministries of Education.\n\nWinners of the Nigeria Spelling Bee competition win up to N1,000,000 in scholarship and participate in the annual African Spelling Bee which is a continental event organized by the African Spelling Bee Consortium as the official Nigerian delegates.\n\nThe competition is for students in any registered school in Nigeria from the ages of 9years to 16 years who have to register on the competition's website.\n\nIn 2010, Spelling bee was held for the first time in Nepal organized by Rotaract Club of Charumati. Where Benish Shrestha, Grade 10, Galaxy Public School who came first, Bibek Rauniyar, Grade 10, Gillette International Boarding School who came second and Arnav Singh from Grade 9 Little Angels School who secured third position.\n\nNow Spelling Bee-Nepal is going Organize by Evention Master.\n\nIn Pakistan, the spelling bee competition is promoted by Dawn, and it takes place every year in October. There are three stages: district, regional and national. National is held in Islamabad. Dawn Spelling Bee is conducted in three stages. District and pool rounds are the first stage of the competition which are held across the districts and cities all across Pakistan. District champions compete in the Regional Championships which are held in 3 regions: Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad. Three regional winners from each group consisting of the regional champion, first runner up and second runner up compete in the national finals in Islamabad. Karachi Grammar School, EMS High School. Beaconhouse School System, Lahore Grammar School has won the competition several times. Laiba Ejaz of Roots School System, Saud Afzal Shafi of Beaconhouse School System, Saad-uz-Zaman Adhami of Aitchison College and Jazim Nadeem of EMS High School have made it several times to finals in Islamabad and emerged as winners.\n\nSylvan Learning Center, a supplemental education organization from the United States, has organized an annual competition for Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah-area schools. The Sylvan Spelling Challenge is held annually in December and February for students in grades 3-8. The Sylvan competition expects to attract nearly 1,000 participants from 30 schools in its inaugural year.\n\nAbu Dhabi University sponsors the largest Spelling Bee in the United Arab Emirates, attracting students from both public and private institutions for the past three years. The Abu Dhabi University Spelling Bee is heralded as the most challenging and well-known spelling competition in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe English Language Department in Jeddah conducted a spelling bee competition, Spell Saudia, in 2017 and 2018. The competition has three rounds:\nRound One: held at the educational offices level and the best 3 spellers from each group are nominated to round 2. \nRound Two:18 spellers from each stage compete against each other and the best six spellers are nominated for the final round which takes place at the ELDJ Closing Ceremony at the end of the academic year.\n\nDifferent companies/schools organize and participate in different, independent spelling bees, but the largest company in Latin America to organize annual international spelling bees since 2015 is Advanced Methods Corporation (Amco), a U.S. based company that promotes learning English as a second language. Schools from Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Chile, Honduras, and El Salvador enrolled to the Amco system are eligible to participate in the annual Amco Spelling Bee, consisting of 3 stages: school (selection of students to participate in the regional, repeats with the next stages), regional, and international. The international one is always set in Guadalajara, Jalisco, in Expo Guadalajara, and is almost always held in the last days of May or beginnings of June.\n\nIn 1876 there were newspaper reports of spelling bees in a number of towns in the United Kingdom. Since 2009, \"The Times\" newspaper has run a spelling bee for schools: The Times Spelling Bee.\n\nSerious spelling bee competitors in the United States will study affixes and etymologies, and often foreign languages from which English draws, in order to spell challenging words. Several preparatory materials have been published, including some in connection with the Scripps National Spelling Bee and those created by independent organizations not related to Scripps.\n\nFor the first several decades of publication, the Scripps annual study booklet was named \"Words of the Champions\", which offered 3,000 words in a list separated into beginning, intermediate & expert groupings. In the mid-1990s the annual study list changed to \"Paideia\" (from the Greek word meaning education and culture), which ultimately contained more than 4,100 words, then again in 2006 to the shorter list, entitled \"Spell It!\", the 2009 edition having 1155 words (911 basic words and 244 challenge words).\n\nThe \"Consolidated Word List\", also published by Scripps and available on the National Spelling Bee website, consists of all words used in the National Bee as far back as 1950. It is organized into three sections: Words Appearing Infrequently, Words Appearing with Moderate Frequency, and Word Appearing Frequently. Nearly 800 pages and 24,000 words long, the \"Consolidated Word List\" is intended for those who have mastered the basics and already gone through \"Spell It!\". Spelling bee participants in the United States also use other reference books and tutoring materials are becoming available on the web.\n\nSpelling bee students usually start competition in elementary school (primary school) or middle school. Classes compete against other classes in the same grade, or level, and the winning class is determined by the score of each class. On an individual level, school spelling bees determine which child will represent his or her school at district, state and national competitions.\n\nIn Uganda, School Spelling Bees start in the classroom, where a teacher introduces new words during normal lessons. In preparation for the School Spelling Day, these children compete against each other to get the winners who then go on to compete with others to determine the School team, which normally has 3 students for the English category and 1 for local language. The winners here go on to the district competition and the regional competition.\n\n"}
{"id": "18955141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18955141", "title": "Structural linguistics", "text": "Structural linguistics\n\nStructural linguistics is an approach to linguistics originating from the work of Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure and is part of the overall approach of structuralism. Structural linguistics involves collecting a corpus of utterances and then attempting to classify all of the elements of the corpus at their different linguistic levels: the phonemes, morphemes, lexical categories, noun phrases, verb phrases, and sentence types. \n\nSaussure's \"Course in General Linguistics\", published posthumously in 1916, stressed examining language as a static system of interconnected units. He is thus known as a father of modern linguistics for bringing about the shift from diachronic (historical) to synchronic (non-historical) analysis, as well as for introducing several basic dimensions of semiotic analysis that are still important today. Two of these are his key methods of syntagmatic and paradigmatic analysis (or 'associations' as Saussure was still calling them), which define units syntactically and lexically, respectively, according to their contrast with the other units in the system.\n\nStructural linguistics begins with the posthumous publication of Ferdinand de Saussure's \"Course in General Linguistics\" in 1916, which was compiled from lectures by his students. The book proved to be highly influential, providing the foundation for both modern linguistics and semiotics. Structuralist linguistics is normally seen as giving rise to independent European and American traditions.\n\nIn Europe, Saussure influenced: (1) the Geneva School of Albert Sechehaye and Charles Bally, (2) the Prague School of Roman Jakobson and Nikolai Trubetzkoy, whose work would prove hugely influential, particularly concerning phonology, (3) the Copenhagen School of Louis Hjelmslev, and (4) the Paris School of Algirdas Julien Greimas. Structural linguistics also had an influence on other disciplines in Europe, including anthropology, psychoanalysis and Marxism, bringing about the movement known as structuralism.\n\nFirst, in America, linguist Leonard Bloomfield's reading of Saussure's course proved influential, bringing about the Bloomfieldean phase in American linguistics that lasted from the mid-1930s to the mid-1950s. Bloomfield \"bracketed\" all questions of semantics and meaning as largely unanswerable, and encouraged a mechanistic approach to linguistics. Those working in more or less the tradition of Bloomfield included Charles Hockett, Robert A. Hall, Jr., and Zellig Harris. Bloomfieldean linguistics in America was challenged by generative grammar, initially articulated in the publication of Noam Chomsky's \"Syntactic Structures\" in 1957.\n\nThe foundation of structural linguistics is a \"sign\", which in turn has two components: a \"signified\" is an idea or concept, while the \"signifier\" is a means of expressing the signified. The \"sign\" is thus the combined association of signifier and signified. Signs can be defined only by being placed in contrast with other signs, which forms the basis of what later became the paradigmatic dimension of semiotic organization (i.e., collections of terms/entities that stand in opposition). This idea contrasted drastically with the idea that signs can be examined in isolation from a language and stressed Saussure's point that linguistics must treat language synchronically.\n\nParadigmatic relations hold among sets of units that (in the early Saussurian renditions) exist in the mind, such as the set distinguished phonologically by variation in their initial sound \"cat, bat, hat, mat, fat\", or the morphologically distinguished set \"ran, run, running\". The units of a set must have something in common with one another, but they must contrast too, otherwise they could not be distinguished from each other and would collapse into a single unit, which could not constitute a set on its own, since a set always consists of more than one unit. Syntagmatic relations, in contrast, are concerned with how units, once selected from their paradigmatic sets of oppositions, are 'chained' together into structural wholes.\n\nOne further common confusion here is that syntagmatic relations, assumed to occur in time, are anchored in speech and are considered either diachronic (confusing syntagmatic with historical) or are part of parole (\"everyday speech\": confusing syntagmatic with performance and behaviour and divorcing it from the linguistic system), or both. Paradigmatic and syntagmatic organizations both belong to the abstract system of language \"langue\" (French for \"Language;\" or an abstract, Platonic ideal). Different linguistic theories place different weight on the study of these dimensions: all structural and generative accounts, for example, pursue primarily characterisations of the syntagmatic dimension of the language system (syntax), while functional approaches, such as systemic linguistics, focus on the paradigmatic. Both dimensions need to be appropriately included, however.\n\nSyntagmatic and paradigmatic relations provide the structural linguist with a tool for categorization for phonology, morphology and syntax. Take morphology, for example. The signs \"cat\" and \"cats\" are associated in the mind, producing an abstract paradigm of the word forms of \"cat\". Comparing this with other paradigms of word forms, we can note that in the English language the plural often consists of little more than adding an \"S\" to the end of the word. Likewise, through paradigmatic and syntagmatic analysis, we can discover the syntax of sentences. For instance, contrasting the syntagma (\"I should\") and (\"Should I?\") allows us to realize that in French we only have to invert the units to turn a statement into a question. We thus take syntagmatic evidence (difference in structural configurations) as indicators of paradigmatic relations (e.g., in the present case: questions vs. assertions). The most detailed account of the relationship between a paradigmatic organisation of language as a motivator and classifier for syntagmatic configurations is that set out in the systemic-network organization of systemic functional grammar, where paradigmatic relations and syntagmatic configurations each have their own separate formalisation, related by realization constraints. Modern linguistic formalisms that work in terms of lattices of linguistic signs, such as head-driven phrase structure grammar, similarly begin to separate out an explicit level of paradigmatic organization.\n\nSaussure developed structural linguistics, with its idealized vision of language, partly because he was aware that it was impossible in his time to fully understand how the human brain and mind created and related to language: \n\nThose working in the generativist tradition often regard Structuralist approaches as outdated and superseded. For example, Mitchell Marcus writes that structural linguistics was \"fundamentally inadequate to process the full range of natural language\". Holland writes that Chomsky had \"decisively refuted Saussure\". Similar views have been expressed by Jan Koster, Mark Turner, and others.\n\nOthers however stress the continuing importance of Saussure's thought and Structuralist approaches. In 2012, Gilbert Lazard dismissed the Chomskyan approach as passé while applauding a return to Saussurrean structuralism as the only course by which linguistics can become more scientific. Matthews (2001) notes the existence of many \"linguists who are structuralists by many of the definitions that have been proposed, but who would themselves vigorously deny that they are anything of the kind\", suggesting a persistence of the structuralist paradigm.\n\nIn the 1950s Saussure's ideas were appropriated by several prominent figures in Continental philosophy, anthropology, and from there were borrowed in literary theory, where they are used to interpret novels and other texts. However, several critics have charged that Saussure's ideas have been misunderstood or deliberately distorted by continental philosophers and literary theorists and are certainly not directly applicable to the textual level, which Saussure himself would have firmly placed within parole and so not amenable to his theoretical constructs.\n\n"}

Set in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1962, the story follows a mute custodian at a high-security government laboratory who falls in love with a captured humanoid amphibian creature. Filming took place in Ontario, Canada, between August and November 2016.\n\nThe film was screened in the main competition section of the 74th Venice International Film Festival, where it premiered on August 31, 2017, and was awarded the Golden Lion for best film. It was also screened at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival. It began a limited release in two theaters in New York City on December 1, 2017, before expanding wide on December 23, 2017, and grossed $195 million worldwide.\n\n\"The Shape of Water\" received critical acclaim for its acting, screenplay, direction, visuals, production design, and musical score, with many critics calling the film del Toro's best work since \"Pan's Labyrinth\"; the American Film Institute selected it as one of the top 10 films of the year. \"The Shape of Water\" received a number of awards and nominations, including thirteen nominations at the 90th Academy Awards, where it won for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Production Design, and Best Original Score. It was nominated for seven awards at the 75th Golden Globe Awards, winning for Best Director and Best Original Score, and 12 at the 71st British Academy Film Awards, winning three awards, including Best Director. A novelization by del Toro and Daniel Kraus was published on March 6, 2018.\n\nElisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins) who was found abandoned as a child by the side of a river with wounds on her neck, is mute and communicates through sign language. She lives alone in an apartment above a cinema and works as a cleaner at a secret government laboratory in Baltimore, Maryland, at the height of the Cold War. Her only friends are her closeted next-door neighbor Giles (Richard Jenkins) a middle-aged struggling advertising illustrator and Zelda (Octavia Spencer) a co-worker who serves as her interpreter.\n\nThe facility receives a mysterious creature captured from the Amazon River by Colonel Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon) who is in charge of the project to study it. Believing it is just a wild beast, Strickland treats it brutally, repeatedly shocking it with his electric cattle prod. Curious about the creature, Elisa discovers it is a male humanoid amphibian (Doug Jones). She begins visiting him in secret and the two form a close bond as she teaches him sign language.\n\nSeeking to exploit the Amphibian Man for an American advantage in the space race, General Frank Hoyt (Nick Searcy) is eventually persuaded by Strickland to vivisect it. One scientist, Robert Hoffstetler (Michael Stuhlbarg) - who is really a Soviet spy named Dimitri Mosenkov - pleads unsuccessfully to keep the Amphibian Man alive for further study and, at the same time, is ordered by his Soviet handlers to euthanize the creature. When Elisa overhears the American plans for the Amphibian Man, she persuades Giles to help her free him. Hoffstetler stumbles upon Elisa's plot in progress and chooses to help her. Though initially reluctant, Zelda also becomes involved in the successful escape.\n\nElisa keeps the Amphibian Man in her bathtub. She plans to release him into a nearby canal when it rains to give access to the ocean in several days' time. Strickland interrogates Elisa and Zelda, among others, but learns nothing. Back at the apartment, Giles discovers the Amphibian Man devouring one of his cats. Startled, the Amphibian Man slashes Giles's arm and rushes out of the apartment. He gets as far as the cinema downstairs, luckily empty of patrons, before Elisa finds him and returns him to her apartment. He touches Giles on his balding head and his wounded arm, and the next morning Giles discovers his hair has begun growing back and the wounds on his arm have healed. After initially walking away, Elisa has sex with the Amphibian Man in her shower. For a later encounter, she fills the bathroom completely with water, which eventually begins to cause water to drip into the theater below. The upset theater owner alerts Giles, who then enters the apartment and opens the bathroom door, interrupting the tryst.\n\nHoyt unexpectedly arrives and asks for the status of the case. When Strickland questions how much experimentation is enough, he is told he has 36 hours to recover the Amphibian Man or his career and life will be over. Meanwhile, Hoffstetler is told he will be extracted in two days. As the planned release date approaches, the Amphibian Man's health starts deteriorating. Hoffstetler goes to meet his handlers with Strickland tailing him. At the rendezvous, Hoffstetler is shot by a handler before Strickland kills him and then continuously tortures Hoffstetler for information (knowing he is a spy by virtue of having heard him speak Russian to his handler) while asking for the name and rank of who has the creature. Before dying, Hoffstetler implicates Elisa and Zelda. Strickland savagely threatens Zelda in her home until her husband Brewster (Martin Roach) reveals that Elisa has the Amphibian Man (having overheard her conversations). After Strickland's departure, Zelda immediately calls Elisa, warning her to get the creature out immediately. An enraged Strickland arrives and searches Elisa's empty apartment until he finds a calendar note revealing where she plans to release the Amphibian Man.\n\nAt the canal, Elisa and Giles are bidding farewell to the creature when Strickland arrives, knocks Giles down, and shoots the Amphibian Man and Elisa. The Amphibian Man quickly heals himself and slashes Strickland's throat, killing him. As police arrive on the scene with Zelda, the Amphibian Man takes Elisa and jumps into the canal, where he heals her. When he applies his healing touch to the scars on Elisa's neck, they open to reveal gills like his; she jolts back to life, and the two embrace. In a closing voice-over narration, Giles conveys his belief that Elisa lived \"happily ever after in love\" with the Amphibian Man.\n\nThe idea for \"The Shape of Water\" formed during del Toro's breakfast with Daniel Kraus in 2011, with whom he later co-wrote the novel \"Trollhunters\". It shows similarities to the 2015 short film \"The Space Between Us\". It was also primarily inspired by del Toro's childhood memories of seeing \"Creature from the Black Lagoon\" and wanting to see the Gill-man and Kay Lawrence (played by Julie Adams) succeed in their romance. When del Toro was in talks with Universal to direct a remake of \"Creature from the Black Lagoon\", he tried pitching a version focused more on the creature's perspective, where the Creature ended up together with the female lead, but the studio executives rejected the concept.\n\nDel Toro set the film during the 1960s Cold War era to counteract today's heightened tensions, specifying, \"if I say once upon a time in 1962, it becomes a fairy tale for troubled times. People can lower their guard a little bit more and listen to the story and listen to the characters and talk about the issues, rather than the circumstances of the issues.\"\n\nA fan of her performances in \"Happy-Go-Lucky\" and \"Fingersmith\", Del Toro wrote the script with Sally Hawkins in mind for the part and pitched the idea to her while intoxicated at the 2014 Golden Globes. Hawkins prepared for the role by watching films of silent comedians Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd and was told by Del Toro to watch Stan Laurel from Laurel and Hardy, whom Del Toro thought was capable of doing a \"state of grace without conveying it verbally\".\n\nThe part of Giles was originally written with Ian McKellen in mind and Del Toro was inspired to do so by his performance as the real-life closeted gay filmmaker James Whale who directed \"Frankenstein\", \"The Invisible Man\" and \"Bride of Frankenstein\", who found himself unemployable in his later years. When McKellen proved unavailable, Del Toro sent an e-mail to Richard Jenkins, who accepted the part.\n\nMichael Shannon was cast as Richard Strickland, the villain of the film. According to an interview with Vanity Fair, Shannon and Del Toro had early conversations about the notion that Strickland would have been the hero of the film if it had been made in the 1950s, something that fascinated the actor. Octavia Spencer, who played the role of Elisa's co-worker, friend and interpreter Zelda found it funny that the people Del Toro used to speak for the mute main character were people who represent very disenfranchised groups.\n\nFilming began on August 15, 2016, in Toronto and Hamilton, Ontario, and wrapped on November 6, 2016. In an interview with IndieWire about the film, del Toro said, \"This movie is a healing movie for me. ... For nine movies I rephrased the fears of my childhood, the dreams of my childhood, and this is the first time I speak as an adult, about something that worries me as an adult. I speak about trust, otherness, sex, love, where we're going. These are not concerns that I had when I was nine or seven.\"\n\nAccording to an interview with \"The Wrap\", Guillermo Del Toro was torn between making the film in color or in black and white, and was at one point leaning toward the latter. Fox Searchlight Pictures offered Del Toro either a $20 million budget to make the film in color or a $17 million budget to shoot it in black and white. \"That was honestly a battle I was expecting to lose,\" Del Toro said to \"The Wrap\". \"I was of two minds. On one hand I thought black and white would look luscious, but on the other hand I thought it would look postmodern, like I was being reflective rather than immersed. It's good, because it got me three million more.\"\n\nAlexandre Desplat is the composer of the film's score. The score won the Academy Award for Best Original Score at the 90th Academy Awards.\n\n\"The Shape of Water\" premiered on August 31, 2017 at the 74th Venice International Film Festival. It also screened at Telluride Film Festival, the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival and BFI London Film Festival, among others. The film was released in two theaters in New York City on December 1, 2017 and then expanded to several other cities the following week. It had its official wide release in the United States on December 22, 2017.\n\nOn March 13, 2018, the film was released on Blu-ray, DVD and digital download.\n\n\"The Shape of Water\" grossed $63.9 million in the United States and Canada, and $131.4 million in other countries, for a total of $195.2 million.\n\nAfter grossing $4.6 million over three weeks of limited release, the film began its wide release on December 22, 2017, alongside the openings of \"Downsizing\", \"Pitch Perfect 3\" and \"Father Figures\", and the wide expansion of \"Darkest Hour\", and grossed $3 million from 726 theaters over the weekend, and $4.4 million over the four-day Christmas frame. The following weekend, the film made $3.5 million. The weekend of January 27, 2018, following the announcement of the film's 13 Oscar nominations, the film was added to over 1,000 theaters (for a total of 1,854) and made $5.9 million (an increase of 171% over the previous week's $2.2 million), finishing 8th. The weekend of March 9–11, following its four Oscar wins, the film made $2.4 million. It marked a 64% increase from the previous week's $1.5 million and was similar to the $2.5 million made by the previous year's Best Picture winner, \"Moonlight\".\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 92% based on 388 reviews, with an average rating of 8.4/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"\"The Shape of Water\" finds Guillermo del Toro at his visually distinctive best—and matched by an emotionally absorbing story brought to life by a stellar Sally Hawkins performance.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 87 out of 100, based on 53 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". According to CinemaScore, audience members under the age of 40 gave the film an average grade of either \"A+\" or \"A\", while those over 40 gave it an \"A\" or \"A−\", on an A+ to F scale; PostTrak reported filmgoers gave the film an overall positive score of 80%.\n\nBen Croll of IndieWire gave the film an 'A' rating and called it \"one of del Toro's most stunningly successful works... also a powerful vision of a creative master feeling totally, joyously free.\" Writing for \"Rolling Stone\", Peter Travers gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, praising Hawkins's performance, the cinematography and del Toro's direction, and saying: \"Even as the film plunges into torment and tragedy, the core relationship between these two unlikely lovers holds us in thrall. Del Toro is a world-class film artist. There's no sense trying to analyze how he does it.\" For the \"Minnesota Daily\", Haley Bennett reacted positively, writing, \"\"The Shape of Water\" has tenderness uncommon to del Toro films. ... While \"The Shape of Water\" isn't groundbreaking, it is elegant and mesmerizing.\"\n\nConversely, Rex Reed of the \"New York Observer\" gave the film 1 out of 4 stars and calling it \"a loopy, lunkheaded load of drivel\" and, referring to Hawkins's role in \"Maudie\", described people with disabilities as \"defective creatures.\" Reed's review was criticized for referring to Sally Hawkins' mute character as \"mentally handicapped\" and for erroneously crediting actor Benicio del Toro as the film's director.\n\n\"The Shape of Water\" appeared on many critics' year-end top-ten lists, among them:\n\n\"The Shape of Water\" received 13 nominations at the 90th Academy Awards, the most of any film in the 2018 race. It won in four categories: Best Production Design, Best Original Score, Best Director, and Best Picture.\n\nThe film also spawned some debate about whether the fact that it was filmed in Canada, with a predominantly Canadian crew and many Canadian actors in the supporting roles, should have made it eligible to be nominated for the Canadian Screen Awards. Under Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television rules, to qualify for CSA nominations under the rules for international coproductions at least 15 per cent of a film's funding must come from a Canadian film studio. Even the film's Canadian co-producer, J. Miles Dale, stated that he supports the rules and does not believe the film should have been eligible.\n\nIn February 2018, the estate of Paul Zindel initiated a lawsuit in United States District Court for the Central District of California against director Guillermo del Toro and associate producer Daniel Kraus, alleging that \"The Shape of Water\" \"brazenly copies the story, elements, characters, and themes\" of Zindel's 1969 work \"Let Me Hear You Whisper\", which depicts a cleaning lady bonding with a dolphin and attempting to rescue it from a secret research laboratory's nefarious uses. The complaint spends more than a dozen pages detailing alleged \"overwhelming similarities\" between the works.\n\nDel Toro denied the claim of the Zindel estate, saying that \"I have never read nor seen the play. I'd never heard of this play before making \"The Shape of Water,\" and none of my collaborators ever mentioned the play.\" Distributor Fox Searchlight also denied the claim and said that it would \"vigorously defend\" itself in court.\n\nIn July 2018, Judge Percy Anderson dismissed the suit and stated that del Toro and Fox Searchlight were entitled to recover their legal costs.\n\nThe Shape of Water was also accused by a French director of copying scenes from the romantic comedy Amelie and the cult classic Delicatessen.\nJean-Pierre Jeunet’s black comedy Delicatessen was released in 1991 and quickly became a cult classic, but it was his whimsical take on life and love in the picturesque Paris district of Montmartre, Amelie, that gave him his first global hit.\n\nHe claims fellow director Guillermo del Toro was clearly plagiarising one of his scenes in The Shape of Water when he has the characters played by British actor Sally Hawkins and Richard Jenkins perform a two-step dance while sitting on a sofa watching an old Hollywood movie.\n\nThere are some very strong similarities in the saturation of the colours, overall art direction and the use of anthropomorphic objects. The music is reminiscent of Yann Tiersen's soundtrack for Amelie.\n\n\"When [Guillermo del Toro] steals the scene of the couple sitting on the edge of the bed dancing with their feet, with the musical on telly in the background, it is so cut and pasted from Delicatessen that there’s a moment when I say to myself that he lacks self-respect,\" said Mr Jeunet.\n“It is obvious that he had ‘Delicatessen’ in mind,” he said.\n\n“I’m not going to sue him for plagiarism, that’s not my style. But Guillermo has enough talent not to be doing things like that,” he told Ouest-France newspaper.\n\nMr Jeunet said he emailed the Mexican director to ask him why he was stealing his ideas.\n“He replied.. that he did not steal from others, that it was [American director] Terry Gilliam who influenced all of us,” he said\n\n"}
{"id": "17329380", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17329380", "title": "The Sorrows of an American", "text": "The Sorrows of an American\n\nThe Sorrows of an American is Siri Hustvedt's fourth novel. It was first published in 2008 and is about a Norwegian American family and their troubles. The novel is partly autobiographical in that Hustvedt herself is of Norwegian descent and in that passages from her own deceased father's journal about the Depression in America and the Pacific theatre of war during World War II are scattered through the book.\n\n\"The Sorrows of an American\" operates on several time levels and depicts the difficult times of four generations of the fictional Davidsen family. At the core of the novel lies a long-kept family secret which the first person narrator, a middle-aged psychiatrist called Erik Davidsen who lives and works in New York, sets out to unearth together with his sister. However, the novel abounds in subplots which focus on the present rather than the past.\n\nOn the death of their father Lars, a retired Professor of History, Erik Davidsen and his sister Inga, a philosopher, clean out his home office in rural Minnesota and, while going through his copious papers, find a cryptic note written and signed by someone they do not know called Lisa which suggests to them that as a boy back in the 1930s their father was involved in some illicit act and that he has kept his promise never to tell anyone about it. The siblings decide to investigate the matter further, if only half-heartedly at first. For the time being, Erik Davidsen is preoccupied reading his father's journals, which the latter completed only shortly before his demise. For Erik, all this will mean that in the months to come he will not only be haunted by the ghosts of the present but also of the past.\n\nIt has been pointed out that none of the characters in \"The Sorrows of an American\" leads a carefree, untroubled existence. The narrator himself suffers from a slight form of depression triggered by his recent divorce, childless state, and subsequent feeling of loneliness but still finds satisfaction in attempting to cure his patients of the complaints he occasionally recognizes in himself. His sister Inga has had absence seizures from childhood and migraines all her adult life. What is more, when the novel opens she is being harassed by a female journalist who states her intention to publicize hitherto unknown facts about Inga's deceased husband, a cult author and filmmaker, and who demands that she be co-operative without telling her what exactly she is aiming at or planning to do. Inga's 18-year-old daughter Sonia suffers from posttraumatic stress disorder, having witnessed, from the windows of her Manhattan school, the September 11, 2001 attacks and the collapse of the twin towers of the World Trade Center. Lars Davidsen, the long-term patriarch of the family, was a fugueur.\n\nBut also the characters outside the family show neurological symptoms. Whereas the journalist who is harassing Inga only bears an age-old personal grudge against her (of which the latter is unaware) and is out for straightforward revenge, Erik's friend and colleague Bernard Burton, apart from sweating excessively, has not been able to cope with the fact that Inga is not in love with him and, without her realizing it, has kept a watchful eye on her over the years in a way which might be construed as stalking. Edie Bly, a former actress who is now impoverished, is a recovering substance abuser who has an illegitimate son by Inga's deceased husband and appears to be in an unstable psychological condition. Finally, the real stalker in the novel, a photographer and installation artist called Jeffrey Lane, displays various signs of compulsive behaviour, for example the urge to document virtually everything in his life by taking photos. He crosses the psychiatrist's path while pursuing his former girlfriend, a Jamaican-born beauty who has recently rented, and moved into, the downstairs apartment of Erik's now too large Brooklyn brownstone.\n\nErik Davidsen is immediately drawn towards Miranda, the young woman from Jamaica, and Eglantine, her pre-school daughter by Jeffrey Lane. He soon falls head over heels in love with the dark-skinned woman while at the same time watching what he perceives to be the slow but steady deterioration of his own self. Gently rejected by Miranda, he has enough willpower left to go on a date with a sexy colleague and, for purely physical reasons, starts an affair with her. As the story progresses, however, he is more and more pulled into the quagmire of events surrounding Miranda, Inga, and himself. At one point he catches a burglar in his empty house at night, is surprised to see it is Lane, confused when the escaping Lane takes a photo of him wearing nothing much but wielding a hammer, and shocked when, months later, he recognizes the image at one of Lane's exhibitions with a caption saying, \"Head Doctor Goes Insane\".\n\nMost of the mysteries are cleared up in the end. Erik and Inga succeed in tracking down the mysterious — and now dying — Lisa, and it turns out that all those years ago a young Lars Davidsen helped her bury her illegitimate, stillborn child, in all secrecy, somewhere on his family's farm. The reputation of Inga's deceased husband is not smeared either when the existence of a batch of letters to Edie Bly can be established without doubt but when it turns out at the same time that they have no sensational value because they belong to the realm of fiction—they are addressed to the character Bly played in one of the author's films rather than Bly the actress and mother of his child. Bernard Burton proves instrumental in procuring the letters without succumbing to the temptation to actually read them, in a chivalric act in which he dresses up as a frightful bag lady in order not to reveal his identity, a scene which also provides some comic relief. The conclusion of the novel is a four-page stream-of-consciousness-like recapitulation of the story's images racing through Erik's mind, and the assurance that the characters' fragmented lives will remain that way.\n\n\"The Sorrows of an American\" was published to almost unanimously positive reviews. Ron Charles calls it \"a radically postmodern novel that wears its po-mo credentials with unusual grace; even at its strangest moments, it never radiates the chilly alienation that marks, say, the work of Hustvedt's husband, Paul Auster.\" For Sylvia Brownrigg, \"the erudite Hustvedt\" explores \"larger questions of art and madness, mind and spirit, and the construction of the self\" through the dialogues of her intellectually minded characters and the interior monologues of her narrator. True, little use is made of the vernacular, which prompts Haley Edwards to state that \"Hustvedt writes very well, but her prose has all the flair of your Aunt Olga's dinner rolls. Sometimes Erik says things about the human condition that are wonderfully perceptive and incredibly poignant, but he seems to say them as if he's observing the human condition, rather than experiencing it himself.\" \n\nWhat some critics found disappointing is that \"the secrets Inga and Erik pursue don't yield the drama or meaning they have hoped for, suffusing the scenes of revelation with an air of anticlimax. This may be intentional—Hustvedt may be warning us of the folly of hoping for neat resolutions in our explorations of past pains—but it means the narrative slackens somewhat toward the end.\" \n\n"}
{"id": "18945331", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18945331", "title": "Three-act structure", "text": "Three-act structure\n\nThe three-act structure is a model used in narrative fiction that divides a story into three parts (acts), often called the Setup, the Confrontation and the Resolution.\n\nThe first act is usually used for exposition, to establish the main characters, their relationships and the world they live in. Later in the first act, a dynamic, on-screen incident occurs, known as the \"inciting incident\", or \"catalyst\", that confronts the main character (the protagonist), and whose attempts to deal with this incident lead to a second and more dramatic situation, known as the first plot point, which (a) signals the end of the first act, (b) ensures life will never be the same again for the protagonist and (c) raises a dramatic question that will be answered in the climax of the film. The dramatic question should be framed in terms of the protagonist's call to action, (Will X recover the diamond? Will Y get the girl? Will Z capture the killer?).\n\nThe second act, also referred to as \"rising action\", typically depicts the protagonist's attempt to resolve the problem initiated by the first turning point, only to find themselves in ever worsening situations. Part of the reason protagonists seem unable to resolve their problems is because they do not yet have the skills to deal with the forces of antagonism that confront them. They must not only learn new skills but arrive at a higher sense of awareness of who they are and what they are capable of, in order to deal with their predicament, which in turn changes who they are. This is referred to as \"character development\" or a \"character arc\". This cannot be achieved alone and they are usually aided and abetted by mentors and co-protagonists.\n\nThe third act features the resolution of the story and its subplots. The climax is the scene or sequence in which the main tensions of the story are brought to their most intense point and the dramatic question answered, leaving the protagonist and other characters with a new sense of who they really are.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "51493767", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51493767", "title": "Transparency of media ownership in Europe", "text": "Transparency of media ownership in Europe\n\nTransparency of media ownership refers to the public availability of accurate, comprehensive and up-to-date information about media ownership structures. A legal regime guaranteeing transparency of media ownership makes possible for the public as well as for media authorities to find out who effectively owns, controls and influences the media as well as media influence on political parties or state bodies.\n\nTransparency of media ownership is an essential component of any democratic media system. Experts, European organisations and NGOs agree that transparency of media ownership is crucial for media pluralism and democracy as, for instance, it provides the knowledge to take steps to address media concentration and conflict of interests. Moreover, public knowledge of media owners' identities can prevent abuses of media power, such as corruption in the media system, opaque media privatisation, undue influences over the media, etc., and makes possible that such abuses are recognised, assessed, publicised, debated and prevented. Transparency also ensures that ordinary citizens can be informed about the identity, interests and influences behind contents and news they consume, and that media market can function on a fair basis, especially, for instance, for new entrants in the market. Moreover, transparency of media ownership facilitates the public knowledge on the media environment; makes possible a critical assessment of the contents produced and strengthens debate on the way the media system operates. The importance of transparency of media ownership for any democratic and pluralist society has been broadly recognised by the European Parliament, the European Commission's High-Level Group on Media Freedom and Pluralism and the Council of Europe. In the last years, there has been an unprecedented debate at the global level around company ownership transparency which has been addressed, for example, by the Open Government Partnership and by the G8 governments in a 2014 statement setting the principles on media ownership transparency. In 2016, following the so-called \"Panama Papers\" scandal, the lack of records held by the Panama-based legal firm Mossack Fonseca, transparency of company ownership gained momentum in the public debate.\n\nTo ensure that the public knows who effectively owns and influences the media, national legal frameworks should ensure the disclosure of at least the following essential basic information: name and contact details of the media outlets; constitutional documents; size of shareholdings over a given threshold; name and contact details of direct owners with a given percentage of shareholding; identity of the persons with indirect control or have a significant interest in a given media company; citizenship/residence status of individuals with at least a certain shareholding percentage; country of domicile of company with at least a given shareholding percentage. Importantly, to understand who really owns and controls a specific media outlet it is necessary to check who is beyond the official shareholdings and scrutinise indirect, controlling and beneficial ownership which refers on shares of a media company hold on behalf of another person.\n\nTo be meaningful and easily accessible by the citizens and national media authorities, this information should be updated, searchable, free and reusable.\n\nTransparency of media ownership remains difficult to fulfill in most of European countries. While some EU member States have legislation ensuring transparency of media ownership in compliance to the best international standards, such legislation is still lacking in many member States and in some cases national legislation allows for hidden or indirect media ownership. A recent 2015 resolution by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, notes with concern that media outlets are frequently owned and controlled in an opaque-manner. This is due either to the lack of national transparency provisions or to non-transparent indirect or hidden ownership schemes, often linked to political, economic or religious interests and affiliations.\n\nTransparency of media ownership corroborates some constitutional guarantees and individual rights which are strictly related to the inclusiveness and openness of the democratic process, in particular media pluralism and Freedom of Expression. Even if media ownership transparency is not directly addressed in key international human rights charters, transparency is a basic precondition for the effective exercise of freedom of expression and the right to obtain information enshrined in Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), and Article 11.1 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Indeed, access to information is crucial for the good functioning of democratic societies as it enables citizens to make informed decisions and choices on social, political, economic issues affecting personal and collective life. Specifically, transparency of media ownership contributes to make the public to establish who provides the information on which to shape personal and collective choices as, for instance, knowledge of the identity and interests of the messenger can help individuals in appraising the information spread through the media.\n\nGuidelines and milestones on what media ownership transparency might entails can be found in non-binding Council of Europe documents, in particular on the \"Committee of Ministers' Recommendation R(94) 13 on Measures to Promote Media Transparency and Recommendation (2007)2\" on \"Media Pluralism and Diversity of Media Content\". According to this recommendations, to understand who and how effectively owns or control the media the public should be in the condition of accessing the following information:\nAnother non-binding document on media ownership transparency is a 2008 Resolution from the European Parliament which encourages the \"disclosure of ownership of all media outlets to help achieve greater transparency regarding the aims and background of the broadcasters and publishers\".\n\nAccording to experts and organisation advocating for media ownership transparency, such as Access-Info Europe, a human rights NGO dedicated to promoting the right to access to information in Europe, to understand who and how effectively owns or control the media, it is crucial that information provided to comprehend and assess media ownership structures are regularly updated, consistent and searchable. Also, citizens should be able to get information on all types of media actors in a given countries, whether print, broadcast, or online, foreign or domestic.\n\nIn Europe, transparency of media ownership is infrequently addressed directly in domestic constitutions, and even when this happens, as in the case of Italy, Romania or Turkey, constitutional provisions do not impose a specific positive obligation on the state to ensure that citizens have access to information on media ownership. The lack of \"ad hoc\" legal provisions on media ownership transparency is partially explained with the fact that often the existing laws have been established with the aim of fulfilling other regulatory objectives, such as providing information to media regulators or for company law purposes. In many European countries, freedom of information legislation provides the basis for requesting information from competent agencies and public bodies. As a consequence, often media ownership transparency aimed at fulfilling the objective of primarily informing the public on media ownership structure is therefore often a byproduct of other measures.\n\nWhen assessing the state of media ownership transparency, five dimensions should be taken into account to establish who and how controls the media in a given country:\n\n\nOperationally many options are possible to guarantee the disclosure of information on media ownership. A simple approach is to call upon media outlets to publish relevant ownership information on an accessible website displayed or linked in the organisation's publications, transmissions or website. Alternatively, or in addition, an accessible, easy-to-navigate and searchable online database on transparency of media ownership can be developed by an independent body. In both cases, to be effective and functional, databases should be regularly updated. Also, to make possible comparisons across countries, a systematic approach to collect, record and share information should be set up, connections and interoperability among national databases should be pursued and shared standards for exchanging data on transparency of media ownership should be developed.\n\nTransparency of media ownership is deeply interrelated with the concepts of media pluralism and media concentration and is an essential component of government obligations to guarantee a diverse and plural media environment.\n\nSpecifically, media ownership transparency is crucial for promoting media pluralism, a principle set forth in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) which entails a positive obligation for the state to \"put in place an appropriate legislative and administrative framework to guarantee effective pluralism\". One of the way for guaranteeing media pluralism is to ensure a wide diversity of media ownership, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for pluralism. Media ownership is also important in terms of pluralism as it might affects media outputs and contents while transparency empowers readers to detect and appraise owners influences on the media and its contents. The European Commission's study on Indicators for Media Pluralism (2009) recognises transparency of media ownership and/or control as a key indicators of media pluralism. Also, media ownership transparency is essential for preventing concentration of media power which can unduly influence public opinion and the political debate. Precisely, transparency of media ownership is a precondition for assessing levels of concentration or other dimensions of diversity in a given media system. Indeed, if readers don't know who the real owners of media companies are, it is difficult to envisage measures to address media concentrations as well as conflict of interests.\n\nThe need to collect and make available to the public crucial information on media ownership, in particular beneficial ownership which in this context refers on shares of a media company held on behalf of another person, is frequently debated in Europe, but there are no agreed standards or binding commitments. In June 2013, governments of the G8 Group adopted the \"Lough Erne Declaration\" which included a commitment to make transparent the beneficial ownership of companies recognising the need to make this information available to relevant authorities to prevent misuse of companies. The declaration was followed by a November 2014 statement by G20 leaders setting the principles on media ownership transparency. In April 2016, following the lack of records held by the Panama-based legal firm Mossack Fonseca (the \"Panama Papers\"), the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Spain reached an agreement for easing the automatic exchange of information of beneficial ownership of companies and trusts. The five countries concerned also urged the remaining G20 countries calling for progress towards a global system for exchanging such information, to be developed, for instance, by the OECD. Even if these commitments are not specifically related to the media sector, they are important steps towards the disclosure of beneficial owners of companies, including the media ones. At the European Union level, the European Commission is working to improve the beneficial ownership provisions included in the 4th Anti-Money Laundering Directive, adopted in 2015 and currently in the process of being transposed by EU Member States into national law.\n\nThere is a group of three constitutional provisions that are relevant when it comes to transparency of media ownership:\nConstitutional provisions recognising freedom of speech and access to information are widely included in national constitutions across Europe, and, even if they are general in nature and scope, they potentially lay the ground for media ownership transparency legislation. For instance, this is the case of Norway that shaped the Norwegian Media Ownership Act on the basis of the obligations enshrined in the constitution. In addition, constitutional provisions, which vary from country to country, do not ensure transparency of media ownership as this depends on how broadly they are construed and then implemented. This is particular relevant when the constitution does not impose a positive obligation upon the state, but simply provides the option of disclosing media ownership transparency data. Constitutions, in some cases, are more focused on disclosure of information to the government or other public body than disclosure directly to the citizens. In this case, the right to access information becomes highly relevant as it is the ground for accessing media ownership data.\n\nThere is a noticeable variation across Europe concerning the extent and the type of the media sectors involved (i.e. the broadcasting sector; print and online sectors) in the provisions regulating media ownership disclosure to public bodies, which in many cases is a dedicated media authority. A crucial issue for media ownership transparency is whether and how the information provided to public authorities is comprehensive, meaningful, updated and easily accessible to the wider public.\n\nGiven the variability of such provisions in Europe, and given the fact that in many countries the required data disclosure is not conceived for directly addressing media transparency, the information provided are in many cases inadequate and does not serve the objective of effectively assessing whether domestic ownership limits or prohibitions are being respected. More specifically, there are at least five reasons explaining why effective media ownership transparency is limited despite the existence of specific legislation.\n\nFirst, European countries legislation is not homogeneous in requiring disclosure from all three media sectors (i.e. broadcasting; print and online). This, also, creates a patchwork of databases containing different type of information, making data comparison complicated.\n\nSecond, in Europe disclosure is often made to public media authorities, but in some cases disclosure is required to a specific ministry (such as the Ministry of Culture in Bulgaria, or the Ministry of Justice in Azerbaijan). This can be problematic because public bodies can have discretion in authorising media services, so any links between media authorities and executive branches should be carefully reviewed to ensure their independence from political power.\n\nThird, disclosure legislation varies extensively across Europe also in terms of the type of information required to be released (e.g. details of shareholders and size of their holdings; interests of affiliated individuals; indirect interests; interests in other media companies; sources of revenues; etc.), including different thresholds and application to different media sectors.\n\nForth, even if media ownership transparency information released to public authorities can in principle be accessed also by the public through freedom of information legislation, in practice, however, in many cases freedom of information is not fully implemented or reliance on it may be perceived by citizens to be excessively complex and even confrontational.\n\nChecks on the data provided and on its regular updating and accuracy, as well as sanctions for failure in reporting or updating it, can help improve the quality of recorded data, which are crucial for assessing media ownership transparency. There is great variability on these sanctions across Europe, but what is common is that sanctions are rarely implemented for a series of reasons: lack of sufficient resources; lack of expertise in the authorities that should check; an unwillingness to check organisations that might have powerful political or commercial influences, etc.\n\nAlso in terms of public accessibility there are considerable variations across Europe: for instance, countries like Norway and Germany developed good practices in terms of online, updated searchable databases. In particular, in Germany the competent media authorities release annual lists with data on national media outlets, including the participating interests, and publish such information on the website of the KEK, the independent Commission on Concentration of the Media. The KEK also publishes reports that are distributed to media, politicians, universities, libraries, etc. In turn, the public use of available databases depends not only on their effective accessibility, but also on factors such as public awareness and confidence in starting and handling requests.\n\nDisclosure of media ownership transparency information directly to the public can be implemented through public registers or by posting data on a media organisation's website. In Europe, disclosure directly to the citizens is often determined not for the sake of controlling or avoiding media concentration, but rather for consumer protection purposes, resulting in the disclosure of information that are badly suited for revealing the true state of media ownership. In addition, as in the case of disclosure to public authorities, some problems impede the full implementation of the existing rules, in particular, lack of enforcement, inadequate oversight and minimal requirements.\n\nOverall, the different national regimes in place in Europe, do not properly perform the function of making clear to the citizens relevant data for meeting citizens' interests in media ownership transparency.\n\nNon media-related specific transparency rules can be found in other legislative acts, such as domestic and EU competition rules, that can indirectly strengthen media ownership transparency, or company laws that require the disclosure of shareholdings interests in private companies. However, while these rules can provide useful insights into company ownership, usually they do not provide real information on who actually owns and controls a media company, in particular beneficial ownership). This is because the primary objective of rules that are not media-specific is not media ownership transparency.\n\nGenerally, these kind of provisions require to disclose data on the name and nationality of the owner's; address; shareholdings; founding capital, etc., but the exact rules, percentages and thresholds vary from country to country. Failure to provide the requested information generally leads to fines and sanctions, and invalidation of the company registration.\n\nDisclosure rules vary remarkably from country to country, and within each country for different types of companies. Consequently, the available data is both fragmented and incoherent, often technical in nature, thus making difficult for the public to understand and for experts to compare data across countries.\n\nSeveral organisations provide valuable information on media ownership to the public. For example, in Italy, the Communications Regulatory Authority (AGCOM) publishes annual reports, which are presented to the parliament, explaining market shares and the main stakeholders in the media market. In the Netherlands, the Commissariat for the Media (CvdM) publishes online an annual report with information on trends and developments in the media market, including data on ownership, market shares, media pluralism.\n\nAt the European Union level, the MAVISE database powered by the European Audiovisual Observatory provides information on television companies operating in Europe with the aim of enhancing transparency in the television sector.\n\nIn many European countries, academics, NGOs and civil society carry out research and mapping of media ownership, and publish \"ad hoc\" publications on the topic. For instance, in Spain the platform \"Portal de la Comunicación\" run by the University of Barcelona effectively monitors the media providing data and statistics to the public. Similarly, in Romania the Mediaindex, managed by the Centre for Independent Journalism, provides useful information on media ownership.\n\nThere are also cases of media company voluntarily providing information on their financial sources and ownership structure directly to the public through their websites. This is the case, for instance, of Il Fatto Quotidiano newspaper in Italy, the Guardian in the UK, and DV in Iceland.\n\nFinally, professional and trade organisations, such as the Norwegian Press Organisations or the Swiss Press Council, establish self-regulation provisions, codes of ethics and guidelines calling for ownership transparency. However, they usually do not provide sufficient stimulus to reveal information that can be politically and commercially sensitive.\n\nOverall, the information provided through these kind of sources and organisations, is not enough systematic or detailed for providing an adequate account of media ownership transparency.\n\nAt the EU level, the legislative competence concerning media ownership transparency is controversial. However, the European Commission has promoted a number of initiatives to improve citizens' awareness of media pluralism, such as the Media Pluralism Monitor, a monitoring tool for assessing risks and threats for media pluralism in the EU member states on the basis of a set of legal, economic and socio-cultural indicators. According to the Media Pluralism Monitor the lack of media ownership transparency is identified as a risk for media plurality. The European Commission's High Level Group on media freedom and pluralism identified “the lack of media ownership transparency” as a key recommendation in its 2013 report. Then a 2014 European Council meeting stated \"transparency of media ownership and of funding sources (be) essential with a view to guaranteeing media freedom and pluralism\" in guidelines issued in a 2014 Foreign Affairs Council meeting. Under the section on actions, the guidelines state that “d) Support actions by third countries to improve transparency of media ownership, the adoption of measures against media concentration and fair and transparent licencing allocation as the associated risks have grown more acute in the digital age”.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "132472", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=132472", "title": "Valencian", "text": "Valencian\n\nValencian ( or ; endonym: \"valencià\", \"llengua valenciana\", or \"idioma valencià\") is a linguistic variety of Iberian Romance/East Iberian spoken in the Valencian Community, Spain. In the Valencian Community, Valencian is the traditional language and is co-official with Spanish. A standardized form exists, based on the Southern Valencian dialect.\n\nUnder the Valencian Statute of Autonomy, the Valencian Academy of the Language (\"Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua, AVL\") has been established as its regulator. The AVL, in agreement with the criteria of the scientific community, considers \"Valencian\" and \"Catalan\" to be simply two names for the same language., although it is considered different from Catalan by a majority of the people of the Valencian Community.\n\nSome of the most important works of Valencian literature experienced a golden age during the Late Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Important works include Joanot Martorell's chivalric romance \"Tirant lo Blanch\", and Ausiàs March's poetry. The first book produced with movable type in the Iberian Peninsula was printed in the Valencian variety. The earliest recorded chess game with modern rules for moves of the queen and bishop was in the Valencian poem \"Scachs d'amor\" (1475).\n\nThe official status of Valencian is regulated by the Spanish Constitution and the Valencian Statute of Autonomy, together with the .\n\nArticle 6 of the Valencian Statute of Autonomy sets the legal status of Valencian, providing that:\n\nThe develops this framework, providing for implementation of a bilingual educational system, and regulating the use of Valencian in the public administration and judiciary system, where citizens can freely use it when acting before both.\n\nValencian is recognized under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages as \"Valencian\".\n\nValencian is not spoken all over the Valencian Community. Roughly a quarter of its territory, equivalent to 10% of the population (its inland part and areas in the extreme south as well), is traditionally Castilian-speaking only, whereas Valencian is spoken to varying degrees elsewhere.\n\nAdditionally, it is also spoken by a reduced number of people in Carche, a rural area in the Region of Murcia adjoining the Valencian Community; nevertheless Valencian does not have any official recognition in this area. Although the Valencian language was an important part of the history of this zone, nowadays only about 600 people are able to speak Valencian in the area of Carche.\n\nIn 2010 the Generalitat Valenciana published a study, \"Knowledge and Social use of Valencian\", which included a survey sampling more than 6,600 people in the provinces of Castellón, Valencia, and Alicante. The survey simply collected the answers of respondents and did not include any testing or verification. The results were:\n\nValencian was the language \"always, generally, or most commonly used\":\n\nFor ability:\n\nThe survey shows that, although Valencian is still the common language in many areas in the Valencian Community, where slightly more than half of the Valencian population are able to speak it, most Valencians do not usually speak in Valencian in their social relations. The statistics hide the fact that in the areas where the language is still strong, most people use Valencian in preference to Castilian in all everyday situations.\n\nMoreover, according to a survey in 2008, there is a downward trend in everyday Valencian users. The lowest numbers are in the major cities of Valencia and Alicante, where the percentage of everyday speakers is in single figures. All in all, in the 1993–2006 period, the number of speakers fell by 10 per cent. One of the factors cited is the increase in the numbers of immigrants from other countries, who tend to favour using Spanish over local languages; accordingly, the number of residents who claim no understanding of Valencian sharply increased. One curiosity in the heartlands mentioned above, is that most of the children of immigrants go to public school and are therefore taught in Valencian and are far more comfortable speaking this with their friends. However, some children of Valencian speakers go to private schools run by the church where the curriculum is in Castilian and consequently this becomes their preferred language.\n\nNote that this is a list of features of the main forms of Valencian as a group of dialectal varieties that differ from those of other Catalan dialects, particularly from the Central variety of the language. For more general information on the features of Valencian, see Catalan language. Note also that there is a great deal of variety within the Valencian Community, and by no means do the features below apply to every local version.\n\n\nIn the table below, the vowels are transcribed in a very narrow transcription. In the rest of the article, the symbols are written for the sake of simplicity.\n\n\n\n\nValencian vocuabulary contains words both restricted to the Valencian-speaking domain, as well as words shared with other Catalan varieties, especially with Northwestern ones. Words are rarely spread evenly over the Valencian community, but are usually contained to parts of it, or spread out into other dialectal areas. Examples include \"hui\" 'today' (found in all of Valencia except transitional dialects, in Northern dialects \"avui\") and \"espill\" 'mirror' (shared with Northwestern dialects, Central Catalan \"mirall\"). There is also variation within Valencia, such as 'corn', which is \"dacsa\" in Central and Southern Valencian, but \"panís\" in Alicante and Northern Valencian (as well as in Northwestern Catalan). Since Standard Valencian is based on the Southern dialect, words from this dialect are often used as primary forms in the standard language, despite other words traditionally being used in other Valencian dialects. Examples of this are \"tomaca\" 'tomato' (which is \"tomata\" outside of Southern Valencian) and \"matalaf\" 'mattress' (which is \"matalap\" in most of Valencia, including parts of the Southern Valencian area).\n\nBelow are a selection of words which differ or have different forms in Standard Valencian and Catalan. In many cases, both standards include this variation in their respective dictionaries, but differ as to what form is considered primary. In other cases, Valencian includes colloquial forms not present in the IEC standard. Primary forms in each standard are shown in bold (and may be more than one form). Words in brackets are present in the standard in question, but differ in meaning from how the cognate is used in the other standard.\n\nThe Academy of Valencian Studies (\"Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua\", AVL), established by law in 1998 by the Valencian autonomous government and constituted in 2001, is in charge of dictating the official rules governing the use of Valencian. Currently, the majority of people who write in Valencian use this standard.\n\nStandard Valencian is based on the standard of the Institute of Catalan Studies (\"Institut d'Estudis Catalans\", IEC), used in Catalonia, with a few adaptations. This standard roughly follows the Rules of Castelló (\"Normes de Castelló\") from 1932, a set of othographic guidelines regarded as a compromise between the essence and style of Pompeu Fabra's guidelines, but also allowing the use of Valencian idiosyncrasies.\n\n\n\n\nUntil its dissolution in November 2013, the public-service Ràdio Televisió Valenciana (RTVV) was the main broadcaster of radio and television in Valencian language. The Generalitat Valenciana constituted it in 1984 in order to guarantee the freedom of information of the Valencian people in their own language.\n\nPrior to its dissolution, the administration of RTVV under the People's Party (PP) had been controversial due to accusations of ideological manipulation and lack of plurality. The news broadcast was accused of giving marginal coverage of the Valencia Metro derailment in 2006 and the indictment of President de la Generalitat Francisco Camps in the Gürtel scandal in 2009. Supervisors appointed by the PP were accused of sexual harassment.\n\nIn face of an increasing debt due to excessive expenditure by the PP, RTVV announced in 2012 a plan to shed 70% of its labour. The plan was nullified on 5 November 2013 by the National Court after trade unions appealed against it. On that same day, the President de la Generalitat Alberto Fabra (also from PP) announced RTVV would be closed, claiming that reinstating the employees was untenable. On 27 November, the legislative assembly passed the dissolution of RTVV and employees organized to take control of the broadcast, starting a campaign against the PP. Nou TV's last broadcast ended abruptly when Spanish police pulled the plug at 12:19 on 29 November 2013.\n\nHaving lost all revenues from advertisements and facing high costs from the termination of hundreds of contracts, critics question whether the closure of RTVV has improved the financial situation of the Generalitat, and point out to plans to benefit private-owned media. Currently, the availability of media in the Valencian language is extremely limited. All the other autonomous communities in Spain, including the monolingual ones, have public-service broadcasters, with the Valencian Community being the only exception despite being the fourth most populated.\n\nLinguists, including Valencian scholars, deal with Catalan and Valencian as the same language. The official regulating body of the language of the Valencian community, the Valencian Language Academy (\"Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua,\" AVL) considers Valencian and Catalan to be two names for the same language.\n\nThe AVL was established in 1998 by the PP-UV government of Eduardo Zaplana. According to El País, Jordi Pujol, then president of Catalonia and of the CiU, negotiated with Zaplana in 1996 to ensure the linguistic unity of Catalan in exchange for CiU support of the appointment of José María Aznar as Prime Minister of Spain. Zaplana has denied this, claiming that \"[n]ever, never, was I able to negotiate that which is not negotiable, neither that which is not in the negotiating scope of a politician. That is, the unity of the language\".\n\nThe AVL orthography is based on the Normes de Castelló, a set of rules for writing Valencian established in 1932. A rival set of rules, called \"Normes del Puig\", were established in 1979 by the association RACV (Real Acadèmia de Cultura Valenciana), which considers itself a rival language academy to the AVL, and promotes an alternative orthography. Compared to Standard Valencian, this orthography excludes many words not traditionally used in the Valencian Country, and also prefers spellings such as ⟨ch⟩ for /tʃ/ and ⟨y⟩ for /j/ (as in Castilian). It is mainly used by private individuals. The position of the RACV is supported by a minority of Valencian scholars active in fields other than linguistics.\nValencian is classified as a Western dialect, along with the North-Western varieties spoken in Western Catalonia (Province of Lleida and most of the Province of Tarragona). The various forms of Catalan and Valencian are mutually intelligible (ranging from 90% to 95%)\n\nDespite the position of the official organizations, an opinion poll carried out between 2001 and 2004 showed that the majority (65%) of the Valencian people (both Valencian and Spanish speakers) consider Valencian different from Catalan: this position is promoted by people who do not use Valencian regularly. Furthermore, the data indicate that younger people educated in Valencian are much less likely to hold these views. According to an official poll in 2014, 52% of Valencians considered Valencian to be a language different from Catalan, while 41% considered the languages to be the same. This poll showed significant differences regarding age and level of education, with a majority of those aged 18–24 (51%) and those with a higher education (58%) considering Valencian to be the same language as Catalan. This can be compared to those aged 65 and above (29%) and those with only primary education (32%), where the same view has its lowest support.\n\nThe ambiguity regarding the term Valencian and its relation to Catalan has sometimes lead to confusion and controversy. In 2004, during the drafting of the European Constitution, the regional governments of Spain where a language other than Spanish is co-official were asked to submit translations into the relevant language in question. Since different names are used in Catalonia (\"Catalan\") and in the Valencian Community (\"Valencian\"), the two regions each provided one version, which were identical to each other.\n\nFor similar linguistic controversies see also : Names given to the Spanish language, Moldovan language, Occitan language, Serbo-Croatian, Comparison of American and British English, and Comparison of Afrikaans and Dutch. \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "35768817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35768817", "title": "Virtual world framework", "text": "Virtual world framework\n\nThe virtual world framework (VWF) is a means to connect robust 3D, immersive, entities with other entities, virtual worlds, content and users via web browsers. It provides the ability for client-server programs to be delivered in a lightweight manner via web browsers, and provides synchronization for multiple users to interact with common objects and environments. For example, using VWF, a developer can take video lesson plans, component objects and avatars and successfully insert them into an existing virtual or created landscape (such as EDGE or Open Sim), interacting with the native objects and users via a VWF interface.\n\nVWF further opens the door to interface different training content, simulations, objects, users and locations; which will extend and expand the scope of training and education. (Imagine running a tank simulation with aviation assets, provided by two different simulations suites, but executed together and passing imagery and sensor data between them, working over a common landscape and feeding a constructive mapping simulation run on a third platform, all seamlessly and transparent to remote users via their browsers). The VWF is meant as a useful tool to interact with differing types of entities (objects, avatars, simulations, spaces). As an open-source tool protected under the Apache II license, VWF is free and accessible to any number of developers who can create content and expand its scope and functionality. The VWF delivers its interactivity using the web, creating an opportunity to align mismatched objects or environments. VWF is under development to work with Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPG) such as EDGE, and ideally will be developed to interface with the latest object encodings (such as \"Unity\" and \"MP4\"), environments (such as \"OpenSim\" MOSES) and other simulations platforms in order to create a truly agnostic interfacing tool.\n\nEven though it has a suggestive name, the VWF is not a virtual world. Nor is it a virtual world generation tool. Can the VWF produce a virtual space and content to fill it? Yes, it can, and it absolutely can be used to provide additional objects and interactions to augment/interact with entities to which it connects. VWF isn’t a simulator. The VWF is meant to extend the use of active client-server simulations in order that they can be accessed via a web browser. It is also meant to add extra dimensions to existing simulations or to create simulation content to add to an existing virtual space (such as MOSES) or a spontaneously generated space. The VWF has the capability to create fully functional simulations but is not meant to be a complete simulator on its own.\n\nVWF is not an avatar, nor does it require an avatar to run. The VWF does not require a virtual space in order to work; it can be used to generate a virtual space within the web browser or locally on the host machine. The VWF does not need an avatar to function, and does not necessarily generate avatars for use with virtual worlds, but can be used to produce or interact with avatars.\n\nThe United States Department of Defense (DoD) cannot continue to do business as usual. In FY05, the DoD spent $9.1B in Modeling and Simulation related activities. Approximately 40% of that budget was used for simulators, war gaming, and modeling. The vision of the VWF is to reduce the funding used to support M&S activities in direct support of pressure to reduce spending and increase efficacy of existing / emerging technology.\n\nThe DoD needs a tool to tie together its myriad, stove-piped, specialty simulations solutions. It needs a tool to extend and expand its ability to train an increasing number of personnel across ever-widening distances. DoD stresses a need to reduce and reuse technology and to find more cost-efficient means to provide the most advanced technological and pedagogical systems of training. It’s not just about training DoD personnel however.\n\nWe are surrounded by immersive, personalized social media and technology (such as Smart Phones, Facebook, Twitter, Pandora Radio, Project Glass and augmented reality sites such as Layar). Traditional education systems do not allow for the pace of information sharing and immersion that media, games and the internet provide to youth on a regular basis and modernization/customization of education is becoming absolutely essential to its effectiveness. The intersection of technologies and the speed/volume of data delivery create a perfect storm of possibility for this system to provide the most good at the best cost.\n\nAs with the Internet, which started out as ARPAnet, the VWF is intended to develop into an open, robust platform that revolutionizes how we perceive and interact with the world. With the VWF and the use of mobile / web enabled devices, users will be able to interact with their world on a grand scale; VWF capitalizes on the same technologies that enable 3D apps to view augmented reality, and will port their capabilities via the web on a large scale.\n\nThe VWF is for developers of simulations, education systems, training content, games, information sharing, private individuals, really anyone with an interest in sharing information with multiple users in a lightweight fashion using a web browser as a delivery mechanism. The VWF is for users to be able to access information, training, or content no matter where they are or what their hardware or bandwidth restrictions may be, as long as they have a secure link to the training server through the internet. The VWF is to provide rapidly available content to those who need it most, when they need it, in a fashion which is accessible and low-overhead.\n\nVWF means a massive savings in preventing redundancy, in linking different systems and in building economies of scale and scope. It means access to unprecedented complexity of training content and a huge flexibility in its delivery. It means faster and more thoroughly trained personnel. It means platform-independent computing solutions for passing any type of data quickly and efficiently. It means highly adaptive, rapid prototypes independent of the platforms which created them. It means staying at the forefront of the computing trends in information sharing. It means a rapid means of generating customized training solutions. It means spontaneous meeting spaces and a method for delivering increased complexity and speed of intelligence to those who need it.\n\nThe DoD owns the rights to the source code of the VWF; however, as it is licensed using Apache II, it is freely usable by any and all as long as original attribution is given to the creators.\n\nThe framework is licensed under the Apache II license, which essentially states that the user of the software is granted a royalty-free license to use, modify, and sell derivative works of, the software as long as the original license and attribution file(s) are included in the distribution of any and all subsequent works. The original work is licensed “as is” and contains no warranties of any kind.\n\nContent rights are managed via the provisions contained in the Apache 2 license. The current content version control is affected by the primary engineers through github, with the latest stable builds published under unique serial numbers.\n\nThe designers are David A. Smith (computer scientist) (Lockheed Martin Chief Innovation Officer – project oversight, design, architecture), David Easter (LM Engineer - Development/Architecture), Richard Boyd (Lockheed Martin Virtual world Labs Chief Architect - governance and ecosystem design), Allison Corey (LM Engineer – development), Scott R. Haynes (LM Engineer - Development), Michael J. Vacirca (LM Engineer - Development), Steven D. Carr (LM Engineer - Development), Cynthia L.

DiGiovanni (Director, OSD(P&R)TRS), Coles/RDECOM (Edge interfacing), Robert Chadwick (ADL – code efficiency and applications), and emerging partners as new functions and libraries are proposed.\n\nVWF is posted on github, and is open to any and all developers who wish to contribute forks, projects, suggestions or build-outs for the framework. The original creators especially seek major platform developers who wish to add interfacing to their platform for use with VWF, such as MMOs, simulations designers, terrain mapping providers, 3D modeling, virtual landscapes, etc. The paper \"A Virtual World Ecosystem Framework\", presented at the IITSEc conference in 2012, explains the philosophy of contribution to the system.\n\nThe VWF is managed via github and developer inputs through a loose consortium of the original creators. In time, the community will stand up a non-profit governing organization, in order to conduct full-time partnerships and version control of the software. Through the use of the latest codecs, interfacing partnerships with major content, object and texture providers, and a persistent location, it is additionally the goal of the creators that VWF will evolve into the standard for interfacing content with users on the web.\n\nThe VWF is available for use in web applications, and there are a few minor applications/demonstrations already constructed as proofs of concept. As the community extends the robustness of the VWF, increases the libraries and finalizes the toolkits, these applications will gain in complexity as well. Developers are welcome to construct web applications with the existing code and examples. There is nothing special required to run completed applications outside of having access to a compatible browser with WebGL and potentially web sockets capability depending on the location of the source objects and interactions.\n\nThere are many applications available which advertise themselves as Thin Clients or web interfaces. There are no open source development tools in widespread use that interface different entities in a persistent, secure manner using a thin client through web-browsers. While there are many tools available, many of them are highly specialized and require proprietary software installed on both the client and server side. There are still other tools which produce virtual environments, avatars, and content, but none of the ones known tie them together, spontaneously create interfaces among them or provide seamless communications to all of the entities regardless of their timing and without a heavy burden in bandwidth or processing power for the client. VWF does this and will do more as it continues its evolution. VWF utilizes web sockets and WebGL, directly providing a content link between entities and build 3D objects in the quickest, most efficient manner possible. Other virtual interfacing programs utilize Flash which also provides direct content, but does so in a less efficient manner.\n\nVWF information is available on two sites: Virtual World Framework Homepage (mirrored on vwf mirror site) and github (search virtual-world-framework).\n\nVWF can be applied to content to train on most tasks which do not require solely live training. Specifically: Curriculum facilitated through simulations, classroom training, augmented reality, mixed media training, and games are the ideal candidates for VWF. Augmented reality content delivered to classrooms, or augmented additions to mobile devices such as this one Also simulations which combine live training with simulated content are good candidates for VWF. The complexity of the training and the number of trainees largely dictates the date by which this VWF capability will be delivered. For delivery of classroom-type training the VWF is capable of being used to develop content. For simulations-type training, following the persistence and synchronization elements of the VWF being developed in the next 6 months (by fall 2012), this capability of the VWF should be possible. For augmented reality and truly immersive gaming, VWF will be under development with critical partners and hopes to have this capability in the coming 24 months, depending on current technologies and partnerships.\n\nIdeally, VWF will be used in live, virtual, and constructive simulation (LVC) exercises as a primary or secondary delivery mechanism. LVC is ideal for VWF delivery due to its large virtual/digital component and its need to be delivered to myriad audiences in a variety of locations/platforms.\n\nLive objects such as aircraft, weapons and vehicles will pass data to the simulator through sensors (read off of the radar/weapons/sensors on the live equipment directly into the simulation and then the input/output data passed through VWF to the myriad participants), data streaming through interfacing servers (in the case of personnel/equipment trackers such as Blue Force Tracking) and through information injection through constructive simulations (such as placing live units on a map and manually tracking their status/positions).\n\nSimulations do not take place “in” the Virtual World Framework. The VWF is a tool to help interface different entities. constructive simulations, in which simulated people operate simulated systems, are stimulated using human inputs. Ostensibly the VWF would provide the interface (via the web) for some or all of these humans who would be inputting data into the system, then would receive the simulation results from the program executing on the server machine/cloud/locally-determined-host, and would display the results in some fashion via web interface.\n\nDevelopers use the VWF to build simulations using Java script and functionality provided through the VWF. The VWF generates the appropriate display and manipulation files at the time of compilation. As the VWF develops a construction environment will be developed in order to allow users to drag and drop content and manipulate it, greatly reducing production time/complexity. This environment is under construction, and is anticipated to be completed at the end of 2012.\n\nThe web is agnostic to content. The VWF is not secure or unsecure. The use of secure socket layer encryption (SSL), virtual private networks (VPN), public key encryption (PKI), proprietary encryption, hardware secured network systems, etc. provides the security needed to secure any simulations produced and interfaced using the VWF. With the use of IPv6, bit-wise security protocols are available that were previously not available to data transport. A potential additional security method is to add a security bit header to the data transported via VWF in order to provide an additional layer of security. This measure has not yet been added to the current build.\n\nThe problem with opening a continuous connection between two computers via a web browser using Web sockets is that it potentially opens up the link to something called cache poisoning, in which someone can directly introduce viruses or other malware to the link, compromising the system. Here is a summary of other weaknesses: Security tool for Web Sockets). Originally, potential security issues led Mozilla and Opera to discontinue support for Web Sockets until the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) could produce a standardized Web Sockets protocol as part of HTML5. A work around based on Connect based handshakes (as opposed to upgrade- based handshakes) proved to be secure. The semantics of the handshake as coded into VWF will take this into account. Since late 2011 this has been largely addressed with latest builds and standards, and many web platforms do support Web Sockets.\n\nWebGL (web graphics library) is a JavaScript Application Programming Interface (API) for rendering interactive 3D graphics within any compatible web browser without using plug-ins. WebGL programs include control code (written in Java Script) and shader code which is executed on the graphics processing unit on the video card (GPU). WebGL is designed and maintained by the non-profit Khronos Group.\n\nMozilla Firefox 6.0 onward, Opera 11 onward, Google Chrome 9 onward (native support), Safari 5.1 onward. So far, Internet Explorer does not support WebGL and has not announced any plans to support WebGL. Chrome Frame and IEWebGL plug-ins support WebGL for IE 6.0 onward.\n\nThe WebGL standard is affected by the Khronos Group, Mozilla, Apple and Google along with influence from United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team which raises security concerns to which the WebGL consortium (headed by the Khronos Group) react.\n\nMost PCs, laptops, and tablets support WebGL capable browsers. Mobile support for WebGL is nascent. Expectations are that current mobile bindings for JavaScript and WebGL are not good enough but there is an Android version of Firefox with WebGL (only about 10% of potential users access content via mobile device requiring WebGL support). Opera also supports WebGL on Android platforms. iPhone does not support WebGL yet.\n\nMicrosoft does not have plans to support WebGL due to security concerns over handshake vulnerabilities. There are two plug-ins for Internet Explorer which support WebGL interfaces: Chrome Frame and IEWebGL. It is true that native support tends to run better than plug-in support, and not all security organizations will support the installation of additional plug-ins to web browsers.\n\nJava Script is a prototype-based scripting language that is dynamic, weakly typed, general purpose and supports object oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles. This means that JavaScript enables the programmer to build a series of prototypes and interact with them using a mostly literal syntax based on C. Due to its ease of use and widespread appeal, JavaScript quickly became one of the most popular programming languages for web applications.\n\nJava Script runs locally in the browsers, does not require additional plug ins or environments (like the Java runtime environment) to run, and does not require compilation or .exe files to be run on the client machine in order to work. It is faster, more efficient, and simpler to build and execute than both Java and C#.\n\nHTML 5.0, ECMAScript5, WebGL, Web Sockets, Collada (or other later file formats), and others as the tool matures.\n\nDevelopers can download the latest build of VWF from github and submit their recommendations, code and applications directly on the site. Github allows users to create their own forks, submit pull requests, and leave questions, comments and support related items in the issue tracker.\n\nVWF is available freely and openly on github to any and all persons, regardless of origin. VWF content specifically designed for operations will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis depending on the content, training objectives, and coalition goals being exercised. There is no standing reason why VWF cannot be shared and there are no security restrictions on the original code.\n\nCan commercial entities build services or games with the VWF? Absolutely. The VWF is meant to interface content via the web, but it also contains construction pieces enabling the creation of games or communications services wholly executable within the web browser. VWF is licensed using Apache II, but this allows for a commercial repackaging of the open-source portions as part of a larger work. These games and services would capitalize on the direct link between entities facilitated by the VWF, while the company would determine where the resources were located. For example: A game company might use VWF to create an online game using their proprietary graphics, and store both the graphics and the program files on their own servers while delivering that content through the web; a teleconference company might more efficiently create an e-classroom with the VWF to take their own streaming media codec and pass their video through the web to a digital classroom environment created wholly with the VWF, complete with avatars and interactive objects.\n\nThere is a multitude of partners and advisors for the VWF project. There are the creators (mentioned earlier), as well as partnerships with Mark P. McCahill from Duke University, Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL), Doug Maxwell (for MOSES) and Cole Corporation (for the Edge military MMO). All of these personnel provide advisory support to the VWF. The creators encourage additional partnerships meant to expand the scope and scale of VWF.\n"}

It serves primarily as a shelter for travelers, at the same time, is also an assembly place for religious occasions as well as meeting for the villagers to discuss the needs and plans of the village. Theravada buddhist monks use zayats as their dwelling place while they are exercising precepts on sabath days. Buddhist monasteries may have one or more zayats nearby. Donors mostly build Zayats along main roads aiming to provide the exhausted travelers with water and shelter. Beginning with Adoniram Judson's construction of one in 1818 Christian missionaries have also adopted their use.\n\nContributions, in money or labor, towards the construction, running or elaboration of a zayat are seen as dāna (meritorious charity). Thus zayats are generally built in a more durable and costly manner than most private houses. The labor is normally provided by locals, while the financing may be local or remote.\n\nSome zayats have evolved other functions over time. For example, the Jivitadana Sangha Hospital for Buddhist monks and nuns began as a clinic at a zayat.\n\nBecause of the importance of \"zayat\" based evangelism to Adoniram Judson's mission, and the prominence that his first wife Ann Hasseltine's letters gave his work, many Christian missionaries in Burma constructed and used one or more zayats, and their letters and journals were widely published by missionary boards and societies in the United States.\n\nThe first Fu Manchu story entitled \"The Zayat Kiss\" was published as a stand-alone magazine story in 1912. This and the next nine stories were combined into the novel \"The Mystery of Dr. Fu Manchu\" in 1913, which was titled \"The Insidious Dr. Fu Manchu\" when published four months later in the United States.\n\n"}
