{"id": "214737", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=214737", "title": "Adult education", "text": "Adult education\n\nAdult education is a practice in which adults engage in systematic and sustained self-educating activities in order to gain new forms of knowledge, skills, attitudes, or values. It can mean any form of learning adults engage in beyond traditional schooling, encompassing basic literacy to personal fulfillment as a lifelong learner.\n\nIn particular, adult education reflects a specific philosophy about learning and teaching based on the assumption that adults can and want to learn, that they are able and willing to take responsibility for that learning, and that the learning itself should respond to their needs.\n\nDriven by what one needs or wants to learn, the available opportunities, and the manner in which one learns, adult learning is affected by demographics, globalization and technology. The learning happens in many ways and in many contexts just as all adults' lives differ.\nAdult learning can be in any of the three contexts, i.e.:\n\n\nThe World Bank's 2019 World Development Report on \"The Changing Nature of Work\" argues that adult learning is an important channel to help readjust workers' skills to fit in the future of work and suggests ways to improve its effectiveness.\n\nEducating adults differs from educating children in several ways given that adults have accumulated knowledge and work experience which can add to the learning experience. Most adult education is voluntary, therefore, the participants are generally self-motivated, unless required to participate, by an employer. The science and art of helping adults learn, the practice of adult education is referred to as andragogy, to distinguish it from the traditional school-based education for children pedagogy. Unlike children, adults are seen as more self-directed, rather than relying on others for help.\n\nAdults are mature and therefore have knowledge and have gained life experiences which provide them a foundation of learning. An adult's readiness to learn is linked to their need to have the information. Their orientation to learn is problem-centered rather than subject-centered. Their motivation to learn is internal.\n\nAdults frequently apply their knowledge in a practical fashion to learn effectively. They must have a reasonable expectation that the knowledge they gain will help them further their goals. For example, during the 1990s, many adults, including mostly office workers, enrolled in computer training courses. These courses would teach basic use of the operating system or specific application software. Because the abstractions governing the user's interactions with a PC were so new, many people who had been working white-collar jobs for ten years or more eventually took such training courses, either at their own whim (to gain computer skills and thus earn higher pay) or at the behest of their managers.\n\nIn the United States and many areas in Canada, a more general example is when adults who dropped out of high school return to school to complete general education requirements. Most upwardly mobile positions require at the very least a high school diploma or equivalent. A working adult is unlikely to have the freedom to simply quit his or her job and go \"back to school\" full-time.\n\nPublic school systems and community colleges usually offer evening or weekend classes for this reason. In Europe this is often referred to as \"second-chance\", and many schools offer tailor-made courses and learning programs for these returning learners. Furthermore, adults with poor reading skills can obtain help from volunteer literacy programs. These national organizations provide training, tutor certification, and accreditation for local volunteer programs. States often have organizations which provide field services for volunteer literacy programs.\n\nThe purpose of adult education in the form of college or university is distinct. In these institutions, the aim is typically related to personal growth and development as well as occupation and career preparedness. Another goal might be to not only sustain the democratic society, but to even challenge and improve its social structure.\n\nA common problem in adult education in the US is the lack of professional development opportunities for adult educators. Most adult educators come from other professions and are not well trained to deal with adult learning issues. Most of the positions available in this field are only part-time without any benefits or stability since they are usually funded by government grants that might last for only a couple of years.\n\nHowever, in Canada, professional development is available in all provinces and territories through postsecondary institutions and most Provinces also provide professional development through their ministry of education or school boards and through nongovernmental organizations. In addition, there are programs about adult education for existing and aspiring practitioners offered, at various academic levels, by universities, colleges, and professional organizations.\n\nContinuing education can help adults maintain certifications, fulfill job requirements and stay up to date on new developments in their field. Also, the purpose of adult education can be vocational, social, recreational or for self-development. One of its goals may be to help adult learners satisfy their personal needs and achieve their professional goals. Therefore, its ultimate goal might be to achieve human fulfillment. The goal might also be to achieve an institution's needs. For example, this might include improving its operational effectiveness and productivity. A larger scale goal of adult education may be the growth of society by enabling its citizens to keep up with societal change and maintain good social order.\n\nOne fast-growing sector of adult education is English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL), also referred to as English as a Second Language (ESL) or English Language Learners (ELL). These courses are key in assisting immigrants with not only the acquisition of the English language, but the acclimation process to the culture of the United States as well as other English speaking countries like Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\nThe principles of andragogy flow directly from an understanding of the characteristics of adults as learners and can be recognized when we understand the characteristics of adults, and see the way those characteristics influence how adults learn best. Teachers who follow the principles of andragogy when choosing materials for training and when designing program delivery, find that their learners progress more quickly, and are more successful in reaching their goals.\nThe Canadian Literacy and Learning Network outlines the 7 key principles of adult learning. In other words, these 7 principles distinguish adult learners from children and youth.\n\nAdults have many responsibilities that they must balance against the demands of learning. Because of these responsibilities, adults have barriers and challenges against participating in learning and continuing their education. The barriers can be classified into three groups including institutional, situational and dispositional.\n\nSome of these barriers include the lack of time balancing career and family demands, finances and transportation. As well, things such as confidence, interest, lack of information about opportunities to learn, scheduling problems, entrance requirements and problems with child care can be barriers in learning. Distance and/or online learning can address some problems with adult education that cause these barriers.\n\nUnderstanding what motivates adult learners and what their barriers are, can assist in enrolling more adult learners. When adult learners clearly know the benefits of their continuing education, such as getting promotions or better job performance, they are more likely to be motivated to attend. When teachers are aware of the student's characteristics, they can develop lessons that address both the strengths and the needs of each student. Adults that are motivated have confidence and positive self-esteem are more likely to develop into lifelong learners.\n\nAdult education can have many benefits ranging from better health and personal well-being to greater social inclusion. It can also support the function of democratic systems and provide greater opportunities for finding new or better employment. Adult education has been shown to have a positive impact on the economy.\n\nAdult education provides opportunities for personal growth, goal fulfillment and socialization. Chris McAllister's research of semi-structured interviews with older adult learners shows a motivation to communicate with people and to get out of the house to keep mentally active. Researchers have documented the social aspects of older adult education. Friendship was described as important aspects of adult learning and the classroom was seen as an important part of their social network. The development of social networks and support was found to be a key motivation of adult learners. As editor of a book entitled Adult Education and Health, Leona English claims that including health education as part of adult education makes for a healthier community.\n\nWhen surveying adult education programs in Japan, Nojima (2010) found that classes focusing on hobbies and very specific recreational activities were by far the most popular. The author noted that more time, money and resources needed to be in place so participants would be able to take advantage of these types of activities. Withnall (2006) explored the influences on later life learning in various parts in the U.K. Results were similar in that later in life education afforded these older adults opportunities to socialize.\n\nSome experts claim that adult education has a long-term impact on the economy and that there is a correlation between innovation and learning at the workplace.\n\nGlobal Reports on Adult Learning and Education (GRALE) are a series of reports that monitor progress on Adult Learning and Education (ALE), promote action, identify trends in the field of ALE, and explore solutions to challenges. GRALE play a key role in meeting UNESCO's commitment to monitor and report on countries’ implementation of the Belém Framework for Action. This Framework was adopted by 144 UNESCO Member States at the Sixth International Conference on Adult Learning and Education (CONFINTEA VI), which was held in Belém, Brazil, in 2009. In the Belém Framework for Action, countries agreed to improve ALE across five areas of action: policy; governance; financing; participation, inclusion and equity; and quality.\n\n\n"}

It aired on Fox in the United States on November 9, 2014, and is written by Steve Marmel and directed by John Holmquist. In the episode, Brian works for a real estate agency, which leads him into trouble with Quagmire.\n\nPeter finds Brian's old rope toy in the sofa, and Brian becomes possessive of it, making Peter jealous. One day, when the rope toy is in Brian's mouth, Peter ties it to his car and drives off. Brian trails behind the car and smashes into a fire hydrant, losing all his teeth and breaking his nose severely. He is miserable without his teeth and Lois refuses to spend money at the dentist to get him a new set since the procedure would be expensive and the fact that he's an animal. While having a drink with Quagmire at The Drunken Clam, Brian starts to cry until Quagmire gives him the number to his dentist where he has an account.\n\nWhen Brian returns, the family finds that the dentist has given him a prominent smile. Apprehensive about his appearance, the family offers support. Brian begins to find the new look suits him. While out for a walk, he is mistaken for a real estate agent. When the actual agent shows up, he gives Brian a job offer to join the agency called Quahog Realty. He finds himself selling lots of properties, including one to Bonnie near a cliff and one to Jason Voorhees that overlooks a camp. The owner sees how good Brian is at selling good property, so talks him to tackling a terrible condo and soon overhears that Quagmire has just received a bonus. Brian pays Quagmire back for the dental work and leads him into buying the property by convincing him it is a great investment.\n\nAfter showing him the prospective video, Quagmire is still hesitant until Brian convinces him a hated rival pilot is after it. After the purchase, the guys accompany Quagmire to the property to find it is a run down dump and was completely misrepresented. Joe reveals that there is an escape clause good for 72 hours after purchase, but when they arrive at Quahog Realty, he is not around and it is revealed that he has ducked out to hide for the 72 hours. Taking refuge at a motel, he finds Quagmire already waiting for him. Quagmire informs Brian that his already low opinion of him has been pushed even further. Brian confesses that Quagmire may be his only friend, but it is revealed to only be a ruse to outlast the 72 hours. Because of this, an outraged Quagmire knocks Brian's teeth out with a lamp. Returning to normal life, the family consoles Brian.\n\nWhile craving the rope toy, Peter becomes a Gollum-version of himself until Lois sends Peter away. Peter then returns as Johnny 5 from \"Short Circuit\". The dumb beaver from \"The Juice is Loose\" is shown twice in the episode. Lois comments that Brian's new teeth make him look similar to Adam Carolla, who is known for voicing Death on the show. Brian sells a house to Jason Voorhees that overlooks a camp.\n\nThe episode received an audience of 3.63 million, the lowest in its timeslot, but the third-most watched show on Fox that night after \"The Simpsons\" episode \"Simpsorama\" and \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\".\n\nNarsimha Chintaluri of \"TV Fanatic\" gave the episode 4/5 stars.\n\n"}

Its author is unknown, but the poem's theme and language enable one to surmise that he or she was from the United States of America and was either a teacher or at least a student of Latin.\n\nThe poem's title represents a multilingual play on words: \"Possum\" is Latin for \"I can\"/\"I am able to\" and colloquial English for \"opossum.\" While \"carmen possum\" sounds like a well-formed Latin phrase to untrained ears, its meaning in context reveals that at least this instance of it is not: On one hand, the only even arguably correct Latin construction translates as \"I am capable of song\" (with \"of\" here constituting not a stand-alone preposition but rather a portion of an English phrasal verb), satisfying (if only barely) the requirements of syntax at the expense of replacing the title's clearly intended semantic content with a clearly unintended counterpart. On the other, the fact that a proper translation of \"Song of [the] Opossum\" into Latin would involve a non-nominative, usually genitive, construction ([\"o\"]\"possi\" rather than [\"o\"]\"possum\") shows that one cannot read the title as having the semantic content clearly intended by its author without also disregarding syntactic rules' constraints on the title's permissible meanings or at least presuming the title's author to have violated those rules when writing it.\n\nThe poem can be used as a pedagogical device for elementary Latin teaching. The language mix includes vocabulary, morphology (\"turnus\") and grammar (\"trunkum longum\").\n\nCarmen Possum is also an unpublished musical piece by Normand Lockwood.\n\nThe poem is written from a third-person omniscient perspective in rhyming iambic tetrameter, with turns of phrase satirising Homerian epic. It chronicles the adventures of two boys who go out hunting for an opossum or raccoon on a snowy night, taking their Dachshund dog to assist them in running down the quarry. Although the dog was often mocked for its disproportionate length (eight spans or seventy inches) and love of chasing rabbits, cats, and rats, it performs flawlessly on the night, bringing the quarry (an opossum) to ground in a long, hollow log.\n\nThe boys run quickly to secure the death of the opossum, chopping at the tree to bring it down. They declare the hunt finished, leave the opossum carcass on the ground, and go home, filled with pride. As they tell the story of their hunt, they are praised by their parents and younger brother, and fall asleep, dreaming of opossums as strong as bears and as large as cattle. Early the next morning, the two boys go to see their quarry, but it had presumably merely been injured rather than killed, and is now gone. They never find the opossum and are dejected.\n\n\n"}

The subculture originated in the United Kingdom in the early 1980s when many hooligans started wearing designer clothing labels and expensive sportswear such as Stone Island, CP Company, L'alpina, Lacoste, Sergio Tacchini, Fila and Ellesse in order to avoid the attention of police and to intimidate rivals. They did not wear club colours, so it was allegedly easier to infiltrate rival groups and to enter pubs. Some casuals have worn clothing items similar to those worn by mods. Casuals have been portrayed in films and television programmes such as \"ID\", \"The Firm\" and \"The Football Factory\".\n\nThe designer clothing and fashion aspect of the casual subculture began in the mid-to-late 1970s. One well documented precursor was the trend of Liverpool youths starting to dress differently from other football fans — in Peter Storm jackets, straight-leg jeans and Adidas trainers. Liverpool F.C. fans were the first British football fans to wear continental European fashions, which they picked up while following their teams at matches in Europe.\n\nThe other documented precursor, according to Colin Blaney, was a subculture known as \"Perry Boys\", which originated in the mid-1970s as a precursor to the casuals. The Perry Boys subculture consisted of Manchester football hooligans styling their hair into a flick and wearing sportswear, Fred Perry shirts and Dunlop Green Flash trainers.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "25174634", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25174634", "title": "Christian influences in Islam", "text": "Christian influences in Islam\n\nChristian influences in Islam could be traced back to the Eastern Christianity, which surrounded the origins of Islam. Christians also introduced the Muslims to Greek learning. Eastern Christians (particularly Nestorian Christians) contributed to the Arab Islamic Civilization during the Ummayad and the Abbasid periods by translating works of Greek philosophers to Syriac and afterwards to Arabic. They also excelled in philosophy, science, theology and medicine. \n\nThe majority of Muslim countries also use a Gregorian calendar and some countries observe Sunday as a non-working day.\n\nIn the late 7th and 8th centuries, Muslims encountered Levantine Christians. The cognate Syriac word \"sahedo\" may have influenced the Arabic \"shahid\" (martyr-witness). During the Abbasid dynasty, translations of the gospels from Syriac into Arabic were made, particularly by historian Bar-Hebraeus, at the request of the Arab governor.\n\nRoman and Byzantine styles were particularly prevalent in early Islamic architecture. One of the examples is the Dome of the Rock (late 7th century) in Jerusalem. Its design is derived from Roman architecture. Madrasa-Mausoleum of Sultan Al Nasir Muhammad in Cairo has a Gothic doorway from Acre, reused as a trophy. The former Christian cathedral Madrasat al-Halawiyya in Aleppo, probably taken by Nur ad-Din Zangi, featured an altar. The Aqsa Mosque has a sculpted ornament, taken from Crusader structures of the 12th century, in the arches of the facade. The upper double capital of the mosque on twisted columns expresses the unity of nature in a characteristic Romanesque style.\n\nAfter the fall of Constantinople, the Ottomans converted a major basilica, Hagia Sophia, to a mosque and incorporated Byzantine architectural elements into their own work, such as domes. This was a part of the conversion of non-Muslim places of worship into mosques. The Hagia Sophia also served as model for many Ottoman mosques, such as the Shehzadeh Mosque, the Suleiman Mosque and the Rüstem Pasha Mosque. \n\nChristological motifs could be found in the works of Nizami, Rumi and others. Islamic artists applied Christian patterns for iconography. The picture of the birth of Muhammad in Rashid ad-Din's \"Jami at-Tarawikh\" is reminiscent of the birth of Jesus. The angels, hovering over the mother, correspond to a Christian type, while the three women, who came to visit the mother, conform to the three Biblical Magi. Some surviving Ayyubid inlaid brasses feature Gospel scenes and images of Madonna with infant Jesus. References to the Annunciation and the baptism of Jesus are manifest in al-Athar al-Baqiyah, where the Virgin is depicted in accordance with her representation in Byzantine art.\n\nThe frescoes of Samarra, painted between 836 and 883, also suggest the Christian craft because of the Christian priests who are the subjects and the signatures of the artist.\n\nChristians (particularly Nestorian Christians) contributed to the Arab Islamic Civilization during the Ummayad and the Abbasid periods by translating works of Greek philosophers to Syriac and afterwards to Arabic. During the 4th through the 7th centuries, scholarly work in the Syriac and Greek languages was either newly initiated, or carried on from the Hellenistic period. Centers of learning and of transmission of classical wisdom included colleges such as the School of Nisibis, and later the School of Edessa, and the renowned hospital and medical academy of Jundishapur; libraries included the Library of Alexandria and the Imperial Library of Constantinople; other centers of translation and learning functioned at Merv, Salonika, Nishapur and Ctesiphon, situated just south of what later became Baghdad. The House of Wisdom was a library, translation institute, and academy established in Abbasid-era Baghdad, Iraq. Nestorians played a prominent role in the formation of Arab culture, with the Jundishapur school being prominent in the late Sassanid, Umayyad and early Abbasid periods. Notably, eight generations of the Nestorian Bukhtishu family served as private doctors to caliphs and sultans between the 8th and 11th centuries.\n\nChristians especially Nestorian contributed to the Arab Islamic Civilization during the Ummayads and the Abbasids by translating works of Greek philosophers to Syriac and afterwards to Arabic. They also excelled in philosophy, science (such as Hunayn ibn Ishaq, Qusta ibn Luqa, Masawaiyh, Patriarch Eutychius, Jabril ibn Bukhtishu etc) and theology (such as Tatian, Bar Daisan, Babai the Great, Nestorius, Toma bar Yacoub etc.) and the personal physicians of the Abbasid Caliphs were often Assyrian Christians such as the long serving Bukhtishu dynasty.\n\nA hospital and medical training center existed at Gundeshapur. The city of Gundeshapur was founded in 271 by the Sassanid king Shapur I. It was one of the major cities in Khuzestan province of the Persian empire in what is today Iran. A large percentage of the population were Syriacs, most of whom were Christians. Under the rule of Khosrau I, refuge was granted to Greek Nestorian Christian philosophers including the scholars of the Persian School of Edessa (Urfa)(also called the Academy of Athens), a Christian theological and medical university. These scholars made their way to Gundeshapur in 529 following the closing of the academy by Emperor Justinian. They were engaged in medical sciences and initiated the first translation projects of medical texts. The arrival of these medical practitioners from Edessa marks the beginning of the hospital and medical center at Gundeshapur. It included a medical school and hospital (bimaristan), a pharmacology laboratory, a translation house, a library and an observatory. Indian doctors also contributed to the school at Gundeshapur, most notably the medical researcher Mankah. Later after Islamic invasion, the writings of Mankah and of the Indian doctor Sustura were translated into Arabic at Baghdad. Daud al-Antaki was one of the last generation of influential Arab Christian writers.\n\nThe one valuable item, sought for in Europe, which Iran possessed and which could bring in silver in sufficient quantities was silk, which was produced in the northern provinces, along the Caspian coastline. The trade of this product was done by Persians to begin with, but during the 17th century the Christian Armenians became increasingly vital in the trade of this merchandise, as middlemen.\n\nWhereas domestic trade was largely in the hands of Persian and Jewish merchants, by the late 17th century, almost all foreign trade was controlled by the Armenians. They were even hired by wealthy Persian merchants to travel to Europe when they wanted to create commercial bases there, and the Armenians eventually established themselves in cities like Bursa, Aleppo, Venice, Livorno, Marseilles and Amsterdam. Realizing this, Shah Abbas resettled large numbers of Armenians from the Caucasus to his capital city and provided them with loans. And as the shah realized the importance of doing trade with the Europeans, he assured that the Safavid society was one with religious tolerance. The Christian Armenians thus became a commercial elite in the Safavid society and managed to survive in the tough atmosphere of business being fought over by the British, Dutch, French, Indians and Persians, by always having large capital readily available and by managing to strike harder bargains ensuring cheaper prices than what, for instance, their British rivals ever were able to.\n\nImmediately after the Conquest of Constantinople, Mehmet II deported all the Christian population of the City, leaving only the Jewish inhabitants of Balat. Afterward, he repopulated the city bringing inhabitants – both Christian and Muslim – from the whole empire and from the newly conquered territories. Phanar was then repopulated with Greeks deported from Mouchlion in the Peloponnese and, after 1461, with citizens of Trebizond.\n\nThe roots of Greek ascendancy can be traced to the need of the Ottomans for skilled and educated negotiators as the power of their empire declined and they were compelled to rely on treaties more than the force of arms. From the 17th century onwards the Ottomans began facing problems in the conduct of their foreign relations, and were having difficulties in dictating terms to their neighbours; the Porte was faced for the first time with the need of participating in diplomatic negotiations.\n\nGiven the Ottoman tradition of generally ignoring Western European languages and cultures, officials found themselves unable to handle such affairs. The Porte subsequently assigned those tasks to the Greeks who had a long mercantile and educational tradition and could provide the necessary skills. As a result, the so−called \"Phanariotes\", Greek and Hellenized families mostly native to Constantinople, came to occupy high posts of secretaries and interpreters to Ottoman officials and officers.\n\nSome of the most influential Arab nationalists were Arab Christians, like George Habash, founder of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and Syrian intellectual Constantin Zureiq. Many Palestinian Christians were also active in the formation and governing of the Palestinian National Authority since 1992. The suicide bomber Jules Jammal, a Syrian military officer who blew himself up while ramming a French ship, was also an Arab Christian. While Lebanese Maronite Christian were among the Masters and Fathers of the Arabic Renaissance \"Al-Nahda\".\n\nToday Middle Eastern Christians are relatively wealthy, well educated, and politically moderate, as they have today an active role in various social, economical, sporting and political aspects in the Middle East.\n\n"}

Rather than either ignoring or staring at others, civil inattention involves the unobtrusive and peaceful scanning of others so as to allow for neutral interaction. Through brief eye contact with an approaching stranger, we both acknowledge their presence and foreclose the possibility of more personal contact or of conversation.\n\nCivil inattention is thus a means of making privacy possible within a crowd through culturally accepted forms of self-distancing. Seemingly (though not in reality) effortless, such civility is a way of shielding others from personal claims in public – an essential feature of the abstract, impersonal relationships demanded by the open society.\n\nCivil inattention can lead to feelings of loneliness or invisibility, and it reduces the tendency to feel responsibility for the well-being of others. Newcomers to urban areas are often struck by the impersonality of such routines, which they may see as callous and uncaring, rather than as necessary for the peaceful co-existence of close-packed millions.\n\nGoffman noted that \"when men and women cross each other's path at close quarters, the male will exercise the right to look for a second or two at the female ... Civil inattention, then, can here involve a degree of role differentiation regarding obligations\". Such a public double standard has been challenged by feminists, who resent the expectation that female appearance/behavior may be routinely commented on. Such behavior may then escalate into staring, stalking and insulting harassment, revealing the costs a breach of civil inattention may bring.\n\nGoffman saw many classic indications of madness as violations of the norm of civil inattention speaking to strangers, or shying away from every passing glance. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "905758", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=905758", "title": "Culture of Lebanon", "text": "Culture of Lebanon\n\nThe culture of Lebanon and the Lebanese people emerged from various civilizations over thousands of years. It was home to the Phoenicians and was subsequently conquered and occupied by the Assyrians, the Greeks, the Romans, the Persians, the Arabs, the Crusaders, the Ottoman Turks and the French. This variety is reflected in Lebanon's diverse population, composed of different religious groups, and features in the country's festivals, musical styles, literature, cuisine of Lebanon and architecture of Lebanon. Tourism in Lebanon is popular with periods of interruption during conflict.\n\nDespite the religious and denominational diversity of the Lebanese, they “share an almost common culture”. \nBased on Article 11 of the Constitution of Lebanon states: \"Arabic is the official national language. A law determines the cases in which the French language is to be used.\" The spoken Lebanese is the language used in public which is a hybrid of the languages of the above-mentioned cultures, Food, music, and literature are deep-rooted “in wider Mediterranean and Levantine norms”.\n\nThe hilly Mediterranean Geography of Lebanon has played a role in shaping the history of Lebanon and its culture. Archaeology of Lebanon is conducted to explore the area's past.\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, Beirut was vying with Cairo to be the major center for modern Arab thought, with many newspapers, magazines and literary societies. Additionally, Beirut became a thriving epicenter of Armenian culture with varied productions that was exported to the Armenian diaspora.\n\nMustafa Farroukh was one of Lebanon's most prominent painters of the 19th century. Formally trained in Rome and Paris, he exhibited in venues from Paris to New York to Beirut over his career.\n\nContemporary art started in Beirut immediately after the end of the civil war (1975-1991).\n\nMany contemporary artists are currently active, such as Walid Raad, a contemporary media artist currently residing in New York.\n\nTwo contemporary art exhibition centers, the Beirut Art Center and the Beirut Exhibition Center (does not exist anymore) in the BIEL area reflect the vibrant Lebanese contemporary art scene. These two centers are intended to host exhibitions and are a must in the world of international as well as local contemporary art. Many art galleries also add to the local art scene, exhibiting the works of artists such as Ayman Baalbaki, Akram Zaatari, Marwan Sahmarani, Nadim Asfar, Lamia Joreige, Jean Marc Nahas, Ricardo Mbarkho, Mansour El-Habre, Anita Toutikian and many others. These galleries are run by gallerists such as Saleh Barakat (Agial), Galerie Mark Hachem, Fadi Mogabgab, Nadine Begdache (Galerie Janine Rubeiz), Odile Mazloum (Galerie Alwane).\n\nLocated in Foch Street in the Solidere area, FFA Private Bank is home to many temporary exhibitions of contemporary local artists as well as to a permanent display of paintings by Lebanese artists (Sahmarani, Baalbaki, Hanibal Srouji ... ) or foreign artists such as Fabienne Arietti's \"Nasdaq\". A Jean Dubuffet's huge sculpture can also be seen when visiting the atrium of Bank Audi Plaza, located in a beautiful contemporary building designed by Kevin Dash. By Strolling through the streets of the city one can find some interesting works such as sculptures of Michel Basbous in the Bank of Lebanon street.\n\nAshkal Alwan, the Lebanese association for plastic arts and a platform for the creation and exchange of artistic practices. It was founded by Christine Tohmé, Marwan Rechmaoui, Rania Tabbara, Mustapha Yamout and Leila Mroueh. Initially, Ashkal Alwan promoted and introduced the work of artists who have been engaged in critical art practices within the context of post-war Lebanon. The Home Works Forum is a multidisciplinary platform that takes place in Beirut, Lebanon about every other year. it has evolved into one of the most vibrant platforms for research and exchange on cultural practices in the region and beyond.\n\nUmam Documentation & Research runs an exhibition space (The Hangar) located at Haret Hreik, in Beirut's Southern suburb with extensive events.\n\nIn the field of digital art, the artist Ricardo Mbarkho investigates the transformation of cultural industries into creative industries.\n\nIn the field of photography, the Arab Image Foundation has a collection of +4000 photographs from Lebanon and the Middle East. The photographs can be viewed in a research center and various events and publications have been produced in Lebanon and worldwide to promote the foundation.\n\nArchitecture in Lebanon includes the legacies of various occupying powers including the Romans, Phoenicians, Ottomans and French, as well as post independence developments.\n\nWhen the Ottomans exiled Fakhreddine to Tuscany, Italy in 1613, he entered an alliance with the Medicis. Upon his return to Lebanon in 1618, he began modernizing Lebanon. He developed a silk industry, upgraded olive-oil production, and brought with him numerous Italian engineers who began the construction of mansions and civil building throughout the country. The cities of Beirut and Sidon were especially built in the Italianate style.\n\nThe Italianate, specifically, Tuscan, influence on architecture in Lebanon dates back to the Renaissance when Fakhreddine, the first Lebanese ruler who truly unified Mount Lebanon with its Mediterranean coast executed an ambitious plan to develop his country.\n\nThe influence of these buildings, such as the ones in Deir el Qamar, influenced building in Lebanon for many centuries and continues to the present time. For example, streets like Rue Gouraud continues to have numerous, historic houses with Italianate influence. Buildings like the Nicolas Sursock mansion on Rue Sursock, which is today a major museum, attest to the continuous influence of Italianate architecture in Lebanon.\n\nKhalil Gibran (1883–1931), who was born in Bsharri, is particularly known for his book \"The Prophet\" (1923), which has been translated into more than twenty different languages. Several contemporary Lebanese writers have also achieved international success; including Elias Khoury, Amin Maalouf, Hanan al-Shaykh, and Georges Schehadé.\n\nMusic is pervasive in Lebanese society. While traditional folk music remains popular in Lebanon, modern music reconciling Western and traditional Arabic styles, pop, and fusion are rapidly advancing in popularity. Radio stations feature a variety of music, including traditional Lebanese, classical Arabic, Armenian and modern French, English, American, and Latin tunes. Prominent traditional musicians include Fairuz, an icon during the civil war, Sabah Melhem Barakat, Wadih El Safi, Majida El Roumi, and Najwa Karam who built an international audience for the genre. Historical figure and Lebanese musical pioneer Lydia Canaan is listed in the catalog of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum's Library and Archives in Cleveland, Ohio, USA as the first rock star of the Middle East. Canaan's unique style fuses Middle-Eastern quarter notes and microtones with anglophone rock. Marcel Khalife, a musician who blends classical Arab music with modern sounds, boasts immense popularity for his politically charged lyrics. Distinguished pop artists include Nancy Ajram, Haifa Wehbe, Fadl Shaker, Elissa, and Mika.\n\nAccording to the World Intellectual Property Organization, Lebanon's music industry is growing and could attain leading status in the region. Lebanese performers are celebrated throughout the Arab World, and with the notable exception of Egypt enjoy increasing regional popularity. Rising demand for Arabic music outside Western Asia has provided Lebanese artists with a small but significant global audience. However, widespread piracy continues to inhibit the music industry's growth.\n\nLebanon is not only a regional center of media production but also the most liberal and free in the Arab world. According to Press freedom's Reporters Without Borders, \"the media have more freedom in Lebanon than in any other Arab country\". Despite its small population and geographic size, Lebanon plays an influential role in the production of information in the Arab world and is \"at the core of a regional media network with global implications\".\n\nAfter independence, Beirut emerged as the epicenter of publishing in the Arab world, characterized by free and liberal media and literary scenes. Lebanon's press became a huge industry despite the country's small size and has remained a haven for Arabic publishing. The establishment of modern printing presses and sophisticated book distribution channels made Beirut a regional publishing leader, and gave the Lebanese publishers a dominant role in Arab publishing. Lebanon hosts annually two important regional publishing events, the Beirut Book Fair and the Beirut Francophone Book Fair.\n\nTelevision in Lebanon was introduced in 1959, with the launch of two privately owned stations, CLT and Télé Orient that merged in 1967 into Télé Liban. Lebanon has ten national television channels, with most being affiliated or supported by certain political parties or alliances.\n\nLebanon was one of the first countries in the Arabic-speaking world to introduce internet. Lebanese Photographers like Said Mhamad have become popular all across world because of Internet and social media. Beirut's newspapers were the first in the region to provide readers with web versions of their newspapers. By 1986, three newspapers from Lebanon were online, \"Al Anwar\", \"Annahar\", and \"Assafir\", and by 2000, more than 200 websites provided news out of Lebanon.\n\nCinema of Lebanon, according to film critic and historian, Roy Armes, was the only other cinema in the Arabic-speaking region, beside Egypt's, that could amount to a national cinema. Cinema in Lebanon has been in existence since the 1920s, and the country has produced over 500 films, some of which are:\n\nLebanese theatre has its origin in passion plays. The musical plays of Maroun Naccache from the mid-1800s are considered the birth of modern Arab theatre. Some scholars like Abdulatif Shararah divided theatre in Lebanon into three phases: translations of European plays, Arab nationalism, and realism.\n\nThe cultural relations between Lebanon and Egypt is considered a unique kind of cultural historical relations, Because there is a considerable overlap between the Lebanese and Egyptian cultures, especially in the fields of literature, theater, cinema and journalism, all of them played an integral role towards each other especially in theater, cinema and journalism, that's what was confirmed by the Conference Egypt in the eyes of the Lebanese and which is Within the activities of the cultural program Egypt in the eyes of the World . Which is held at the headquarters of the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism, and in the presence of the Lebanese Ambassador in Egypt, Madeleine Tabar and Ahmed Ghanem founder of cultural program Egypt in the eyes of the World and an elite of Lebanese artists.\n\nMany Christians and most Muslims who live in the cities wear European style clothes. In the countryside, women sometimes wear traditional colorful skirts and men wear a traditional sherwal (baggy trousers). Dress was historically Ottoman, but remains only as part of the folk culture. Today, almost all Lebanese wear Western clothing.\n\nFamous names in the Lebanese fashion industry include Elie Saab, Zuhair Murad, Reem Acra, and Rabih Kayrouz.\n\nLebanon celebrates national holidays and both Christian and Muslim holidays.\n\nChristian holidays are celebrated following both the Gregorian Calendar and Julian Calendar. Maronites, Greek Orthodox, Catholics, Protestant, and Melkite Christians follow the Gregorian Calendar and thus celebrate Christmas on 25 December. Armenian Orthodox Christians celebrate Christmas on 6 January, as they follow the Julian Calendar.\n\nMuslim holidays are followed based on the Islamic lunar calendar. Muslim holidays that are celebrated include Eid al-Fitr (the three-day feast at the end of the Ramadan month), Eid al-Adha (The Feast of the Sacrifice) which is celebrated during the annual pilgrimage to Mecca and also celebrates Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his son to God, the Birth of the Prophet Muhammad, and Ashura. Lebanon's National Holidays include Workers Day, Independence day, and Martyrs Day.\n\nMusic festivals, often hosted at historical sites, are a customary element of Lebanese culture. Among the most famous are Baalbeck International Festival, Byblos International Festival, Beiteddine International Festival, Broumana Festival, Batroun Festival, Dhour Chwer Festival and Tyr Festival. These festivals are promoted by Lebanon's Ministry of Tourism, Lebanon Hosts about 15 Concerts from International Performers Each Year Ranking Number one for Nightlife in the Middle east and 6th Worldwide.\n\nLebanese cuisine is similar to those of many countries in the Eastern Mediterranean, such as Syria, Turkey, Greece, and Cyprus.\n\nThe Lebanese national dishes are the kibbe, a meat pie made from finely minced lamb and burghul (cracked wheat), and the tabbouleh, a salad made from parsley, tomatoes, and burghul. The national beverage is arak, a strong anise-flavored liquor made from fermented grape juice. It is usually drunk with water and ice, which turns the clear liquid milky-white, and usually accompanies food. Arak is a strong spirit similar to the Greek ouzo and the Turkish raki.\n\nLebanese restaurant meals begin with a wide array of mezze - small savoury dishes, such as dips, salads, and pastries. The mezze are typically followed by a selection of grilled meat or fish. In general, meals are finished with Arabic coffee and fresh fruit, though sometimes a selection of traditional sweets will be offered as well.\n\nM'Juhdara, a thick stew of onions, rice, and lentils, is sometimes considered poor man's fare and is often eaten around Lent by people in the Lebanese diaspora.\n\nBeirut and its environs contain many restaurants of various national origins. At the same time, wine is growing in popularity and a number of vineyards currently exist in the Bekaa valley and elsewhere. Beer is also highly popular and Lebanon produces a number of local beers, of which almaza is perhaps the most popular.\n\nLebanese cuisine is influenced by other Mediterranean cuisines. Pita bread is a staple. The Lebanese enjoy hummus (a chick pea dip), fool (a fava bean dip), and other bean dishes. Rice is nearly a staple, and pasta is very popular. Salted yogurt is common in many dishes. Red meat and chicken are common but are usually eaten as part of a dish. Eating in Lebanon is tied to family: people almost never eat alone. The Lebanese consider eating out a social and almost aesthetic experience. During Lent, Christians eat meatless dishes and at Saint Barbara, they eat a variety of wheat-based dishes. Lebanon sells fruits and vegetables to neighboring Arab countries, as well as to Italy, France, and the United States. Wine is produced in the Bekaa and exported to France.\n\nLebanese society is similar to certain cultures of Mediterranean Europe as the country is \"linked ideologically and culturally to Europe through France, and its uniquely diverse religious composition [create] a rare environment that [is] at once Arab and European. It is often considered as Europe's gateway to Western Asia as well as Asia's gateway to the Western World.\n\nMixed-sex groups of youth are very common especially in Verdun, Hamra Street, Ashrafieh, and downtown Beirut as well as other places. Premarital physical sexual relations are very common, although intercourse is frowned upon and avoided by both Muslim and Christian girls.\n\nThe contraceptive prevalence rate is estimated at 58%, of which 34% modern contraceptives, primarily IUDs, pills and condoms. Prostitution in Lebanon is nominally legal.\n\nBy comparison to most other Arab capitals, Beirut is more westernized and more culturally liberal. Compared to Damascus, Cairo, and Baghdad, and especially in contrast to such cities as Riyadh, Beirut is more tolerant with regard to relations between men and women, and also with regard to homosexuality.\n\nNotwithstanding the persistence of traditional attitudes regarding the role of women, Lebanese women enjoy equal civil rights and attend institutions of higher education in large numbers (for example, women constituted 41 percent of the student body at the American University of Beirut in 1983). Although women in Lebanon have their own organizations, most exist as subordinate branches of the political parties.\n\nWhile gay sex does not enjoy wide acceptance, Beirut has a number of gay bars and nightclubs, in addition to five LGBT rights organizations, namely Helem, Arab Foundation for Equality (AFE), Nasawiya-Feminist Collecrive, Proud Lebanon, and Mosaïque. \n\nIn 2009, the country hosted the Winter Asian Games, which took place in the capital, Beirut.\n\n\n"}

Slabs of coloured glass, to square or rectangular and typically up to thick, are shaped by breaking with a hammer or cutting with a saw. The edges of the resulting pieces may be chipped or faceted to increase the refraction and reflection effects.\n\nThe pieces are laid out to a design, similar to traditional stained-glass work. The pieces are laid on a bed of sand, bounded by a wooden casting frame. A matrix material, sand and cement or epoxy resin, is poured between the glass pieces and allowed to dry, typically requiring 24 hours to harden. The visible glass faces are then cleaned and the resulting solid panel can be relocated, embedded or hung as required.\n\nThe use of thicker glass produces deeper colour effects than traditional lead came stained-glass, especially when illuminated by bright natural or artificial light.\n\nThe technique achieved prominence in the stained glass literature of the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nThe resulting works may be subject to structural problems over time and, just like more traditional stained glass works, pose challenges to conservators and restorers.\n\nDalle de verre was brought to the UK by Pierre Fourmaintraux who joined James Powell and Sons (later Whitefriars Glass Studio) in 1956 and trained Dom Charles Norris in the technique. Norris was a Dominican Friar who went on to become arguably the most prolific British proponent of dalle de verre. His work is incorporated in several Modernist listed Catholic churches.\n"}
{"id": "4614886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4614886", "title": "Domestic trade", "text": "Domestic trade\n\nDomestic trade, also known as internal trade , is the exchange of domestic goods within the boundaries of a country. This may be sub-divided into two categories, wholesale and retail. Wholesale trade is concerned with buying goods from manufacturers or dealers or producers in large quantities and selling them in smaller quantities to others who may be retailers or even consumers. Wholesale trade is undertaken by wholesale merchants or wholesale commission agents. \n\nRetail trade is concerned with the sale of goods in small quantities to consumers. This type of trade is taken care of by retailers. In actual practice, however, manufacturers and wholesalers may also undertake retail distribution of goods to bypass the intermediary retailer, by which they earn higher profits.\n\nThe importance of domestic trade in a country is that it facilitates exchange of goods within the country. By doing this it also makes sure that factors of production reach to the right places so that the economy of the country can grow. By allowing all different types of goods and services to reach to all parts of the country it improves the standard of living of the residents of the country as well as the employment rate of the country. And it helps the growth of an industry by ensuring the availability of raw materials. \n\nTraders from outside the country will have to come in contact with internal traders, because it is not easy to come directly into another country and get the required products.\n\nWholesalers play a major role in working of domestic trade. One could even say that it is the backbone of the domestic market. A wholesaler is directly in contact with the manufacturers but in indirect contact with the consumers. A wholesaler generally deals with one type of industry. e.g. machinery, textile, stationery. A wholesaler is not only into selling of products as it is also involved in packaging, advertising, grading, and market research. They have their own go downs which saves the manufacturers from bothering about storage. They normally make cash payments from retailers and sometimes consumers themselves and give advance payments which benefits the manufacturers. They sell in smaller quantities to retailers, which refrains the retailers from requiring storage space. They do allow credit facilities to retailers at times. For example as we see that Bhija one of the great wholesalers usually get information documents from retailers.\n\nA retailer is normally the final seller of a product. It makes its purchases made from Wholesalers and sales are made to the customers directly. Retailers do not particularly have to be from one industry i.e. they can trade in a variety of products at the same time. It generally has purchases made by credit and sales made in cash. Sales as compared to wholesalers are made in small quantities.\n"}
{"id": "533263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=533263", "title": "Dumbing down", "text": "Dumbing down\n\nDumbing down is the deliberate oversimplification of intellectual content in education, literature, and cinema, news, video games and culture. The term \"dumbing down\" originated in 1933, as movie-business slang used by screenplay writers, meaning: \"[to] revise so as to appeal to those of little education or intelligence\". Dumbing-down varies according to subject matter, and usually involves the diminishment of critical thought, by undermining intellectual standards within language and learning; thus trivializing meaningful information, culture, and academic standards, as in the case of popular culture.\n\nIn \"Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste\" (1979), the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu (1930–2002) proposed that, in a society in which the cultural practices of the ruling class are rendered and established as the legitimate culture of that society, that action then devalues the cultural capital of the subordinate social classes, and thus limits their social mobility within their own society.\n\nIn the late 20th century, the proportion of young people attending university in the UK increased sharply, including many who previously would not have been considered to possess the appropriate scholastic aptitude. In 2003, the UK Minister for Universities, Margaret Hodge, criticised Mickey Mouse degrees as a negative consequence of universities dumbing down their courses to meet \"the needs of the market\": these are degrees conferred for studies in a field of endeavour \"where the content is perhaps not as [intellectually] rigorous as one would expect, and where the degree, itself, may not have huge relevance in the labour market\": thus, a university degree of slight intellectual substance, which the student earned by \"simply stacking up numbers on Mickey Mouse courses, is not acceptable\".\n\nIn 2007 Wellington Grey, a high school physics instructor in London, published an Internet petition objecting to what he described as a dumbed-down curriculum. He wrote: \"I am a physics teacher. Or, at least, I used to be\"; and complained that \"[Mathematical] calculations – the very soul of physics – are absent from the new General Certificate of Secondary Education.\" Among the examples of dumbing-down that he provided were: \"Question: Why would radio stations broadcast digital signals, rather than analogue signals? Answer: Can be processed by computer/ipod\" to \"Question: Why must we develop renewable energy sources?\" (a political question).\n\nIn \"\" (1991, 2002), John Taylor Gatto presented speeches and essays, including \"The Psychopathic School\", his acceptance speech for the 1990 New York City Teacher of the Year award, and \"The Seven-Lesson Schoolteacher\", his acceptance speech upon being named as the New York State Teacher of the Year for 1991. Gatto writes that while he was hired to teach English and literature, he came to believe he was employed as part of a social engineering project. The \"seven lessons\" at the foundation of schooling were never explicitly stated, Gatto writes, but included teaching students that their self-worth depended on outside evaluation; that they were constantly ranked and supervised; and that they had no opportunities for privacy or solitude. Gatto speculated:\n\nIn examining the seven lessons of teaching, Gatto concluded that \"all of these lessons are prime training for permanent underclasses, people deprived forever of finding the center of their own special genius.\" That \"school is a twelve-year jail sentence, where bad habits are the only curriculum truly learned. I teach school, and win awards doing it. I should know.\"\n\nIncreased business competition and the introduction of econometric methods changed the business practices of the mass communications media. The business monopoly practice of media consolidation reduced the breadth and the depth of the journalism practiced and provided for the information of the public. The reduction of operating costs (overhead expenses) eliminated foreign news bureaus and reporters, in favour of presenting the public relations publications (news releases) of governments, businesses, and political parties as fact.\n\nRefinements in measurement of approval ratings and audience size increased the incentive for journalists and TV producers to write simplistic material, diminishing the intellectual complexity of the argument presented, usually at the expense of factual accuracy and rationality. Cultural theorists, such as Richard Hoggart, Raymond Williams, Neil Postman, Henry Giroux, and Pierre Bourdieu, invoked these effects as evidence that commercial television is an especially pernicious contributor to the dumbing-down of communications. Nonetheless, the cultural critic Stuart Hall said that the people responsible for teaching critical thinking – parents and academic instructors – can improve the quality (breadth and depth) of their instruction by occasionally including television programmes.\n\nIn France, Michel Houellebecq has written (not excluding himself) of \"the shocking dumbing-down of French culture and intellect as was recently pointed out, [2008] sternly but fairly, by \"TIME\" magazine.\"\n\nSoftware used on computers and mobile devices, can do complex tasks sometimes requiring users to have a lot of technical knowledge\".\" Similarly, user operated devices, such as a washing machine or a camera, perform many complex operations. A lot of effort has been put into making these easier to use. Sometimes by use of good ergonomics, known as usability. And sometimes by removing some of the choices and functionality available. The process of reducing the functionality is often known as dumbing down. For some users, this removes confusing barriers and gives them confidence to use the software or device. For others, the missing functionality may be frustrating and too restrictive. \n\nReplacing a user operated function with an automatic function that achieves the same result would not be considered dumbing down. However, any loss of flexibility in this automation would be the actual dumbing down. \n\nAn example of dumbing down in software is where an email application on a smartphone or tablet computer may lack certain functions which are available on a desktop computer, such as the ability to create email folders or email rules.\n\nThe science fiction film \"Idiocracy\" (2005) portrays the U.S. as a greatly dumbed-down society 500 years in the future, in which low cultural and Philistinism were unintentionally achieved by eroding language and education coupled with dysgenics, where people of lower intelligence reproduced faster than the people of higher intelligence. Similar concepts appeared in earlier works, notably the science fiction short story \"The Marching Morons\" (1951), by Cyril M. Kornbluth which also features a modern-day protagonist in a future dominated by low-intelligence persons. Moreover, the novel \"Brave New World\" (1931), by Aldous Huxley, discussed the ways a utopian society was deliberately dumbed down in order to maintain political stability and social order by eliminating complex concepts unnecessary for society to function (e.g., the Savage tries reading Shakespeare to the masses and is not understood). More malevolent uses of dumbing down to preserve the social order are also portrayed in \"The Matrix\", \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" and many dystopian movies.\n\nThe social critic Paul Fussell touched on these themes (\"prole drift\") in his non-fiction book \"Class: A Guide Through the American Status System\" (1983) and focused on them specifically in \"BAD: or, The Dumbing of America\" (1991).\n\nThe musical groups Chumbawamba, The Divine Comedy, Ugly Duckling, and Lupe Fiasco each have a song titled \"Dumb It Down\".\n\n\n"}

The project includes a photo essay-style collection of aerial photography produced by Arthus-Bertrand, in which the photographer captured vistas of Earth from various aircraft during a ten-year period. It gave birth to a book also entitled \"Earth from Above\", of which millions of copies were sold.\n\nArthus-Bertrand founded the Altitude Agency in 1991, the world's first press agency and image bank specializing in aerial photography. The agency holds 350,000 \"selected images\" taken in more than a hundred countries.

It consists of four television series that have run from 2005 to present and a single film. The first was shown in 2005 carrying the title alone and ended in the same year with total of 160 episodes. The second series title \"Etheria\" premiered in the same year and ended in 2006 with 50 episodes. Due to its significant success, the third series title \"\" premiered in 2006 consisting of 48 episodes. In 2016, 11 years after the original run, a reboot of the series premiered on the same network featuring new casts. In 2005, \"Encantadia\" had a crossover film with \"Mulawin\" entitled \"\", which was produced by GMA Films as an entry to the 2005 Metro Manila Film Festival \n\nEncantadia is a vast and enchanted realm. It comprises three major kingdoms: Lireo, Sapiro and Hathoria and one autonomous territory, Adamya.\nAt the beginning, Encantadia was at peace, there was only one gemstone, the Mother Gem, given by their deity, Emre. It ensured the balance of nature in Encantadia. But greedy encantados such as a fairy named Adhara, wanted to seize the power of the gem. Also, distrust among the four territories made a fragile political climate in their realm. The other territories think that Lireo, the queendom of fairies, wield too much power since their queen and founder Cassiopeia is the keeper of the Mother Gem. They think that too much power could corrupt the fairies. To balance the powers to each kingdom and to make it harder to seize the powers all at once, the keeper of the Mother Gem, Cassiopeia, made the fateful decision and cleaved the gem. It resulted in a violent explosion and the once single gem became four parts. Each gemstone was given to the four major territories of Encantadia.\nLireo, in the east, is the matriarchal queendom of diwatas and lambanas (fairies and pixies). They cared for Brilyante ng Hangin (Gemstone of Air). It is the home of the temple of their supreme deity, Emre.\nSapiro, in the north, is the kingdom of healers and valiant warriors. They kept the Brilyante ng Lupa (Gemstone of Earth). Their land is blessed with fertile soil and minerals like no other kingdom in their world.\nHathoria, in the west, is the kingdom of militaristic miners and blacksmiths that develop weapons and war machinery. They held the Brilyante ng Apoy (Gemstone of Fire).\nAdamya, in the south, is the territory of wise pacifist lamang-lupas (dwarves and hobbits). They kept the Brilyante ng Tubig (Gemstone of Water). This territory surrounded by the Adamyan Ocean, thrives in fishing and farming. It is also the only unfortified territory in Encantadia.\nCassiopeia thought that this would bring peace to their land but instead it brought chaos.\nHathoria, led by King Arvak, gave in to their greed and started a war to claim the other gems that they may gain power and rule over their whole world. He wanted the natural resources brought by the gemstones for the advancement of his own kingdom, firmly believing that their kingdom is more deserving to keep all the four gemstones. After seizing the Gemstone of Water from Adamya, the Hathors waged war with the Sapiro, in pursuit of the Gemstone of Earth. King Arvak seized the Gemstone of Earth from King Armeo of Sapiro before killing him. Later, King Arvak was killed by the Prince Raquim of Sapiro, Armeo's cousin. Before Arvak died, Raquim claimed the Gemstones of Water, Earth and Fire from Arvak's possession. The death of King Arvak weakened the Hathor force and made them retreat. But Hathoria, in retaliation, managed to massacre the Sapiryan royal family and destroy the kingdom. The kingdom of Sapiro fell and was left in ruins, its citizens scattered into different tribes in the northern mountains. Prince Raquim immediately brought the three gemstones to Queen Mine-a of Lireo, the current keeper of Gemstone of Air, for safekeeping. The four gems have not been separated since. Since then, the monarch of Lireo not only rules the kingdom but also is tasked to be the protector of the four gemstones.\nThousands of years have passed and the story unfolds in Lireo, when Queen Mine-a will choose her successor from her daughters, the four Sang'gres (Royal Blood Fairies), Pirena, Amihan, Alena and Danaya. She and Imaw, an elder from Adamya, can feel imminent danger lurking, and as she is being called to Devas (the world of the blessed dead), she has to leave the kingdom of Lireo in good and capable hands. She put her daughters to the test to see their capabilities and know who is best fit to be the next queen. Mine-a chooses and crowns Amihan, which to Pirena's dismay, led to her rebellion. Pirena's treachery set the chain of events that transpired for the separation of the gemstones. Pirena, after having stolen the Gemstone of Fire, sided with the Hathors and gave them back the power they've lost. Hathoria now plans to rise up from hiding and bring Lireo to its demise, with the end in view of ruling over the whole of Encantadia. Fortunately, Queen Mine-a before her death willed the remaining gemstones to her daughters. the youngest, Danaya became the keeper of the Gemstone of Earth. Her third daughter, Alena, became the keeper of the Gemstone of Water and her second daughter and new queen of Lireo, Amihan, became the keeper of the Gemstone of Air.\nPirena feigned reconciliation with her sisters after their mother's death. She hid her connivance with Hathoria from her sisters. Because of Pirena's lies and manipulations, she was successful in destroying the relationship of her sisters and usurping the throne from Amihan through the help of King Hagorn of Hathoria. But her treachery came back to her as she discovered too late that King Hagorn was just using her to gain access to the gemstones. With the Gemstone of Fire and Water back in Hathorian hands, the destined savior of Encantadia, Amihan's lost daughter, Lira, must unite the four sisters to gain back the lost gemstones and to bring balance again to their world. They will also find an ally in a warrior named Ybarro, which was later revealed to be the lost and only surviving member of the Sapiryan royal family, Prince Ibrahim, destined to unite and bring back the glory of the fallen kingdom of Sapiro. The sisters will soon learn that the greatest magic of all is forgiveness and love and that only through unity can they stop the evil that spread through their realm.\nBut with the Gemstone of Fire and Water under Hathorian hands, the sisters found it hard to reclaim Lireo from Hathorian rule. They will find their answer in the most unlikely of all beings. A lost human boy that was kidnapped into Encantadia named Paopao became Amihan's saviour. They shall soon discover that the boy wields an unknown Gemstone, the Gemstone of Quintessence/Soul, it was catapulted during the explosion the night the Mother Gem was cleaved. It was buried in the earth, hidden from the knowledge of all encantados, until Paopao accidentally discovered the gemstone. The new gemstone gave the sisters the leverage and hope to go against the now powerful Hathorian throne.\nFortunately, the sisters managed to bring down the kingdom of Hathoria and bring peace to their realm. They also succeeded in uniting the gem fragments to form the Mother Gem again. They thought they have achieved peace but a new threat came their way.\n\nIn the beginning, the world of Encantadia was created when the five major bathaluman (deities) Arde, his brother Emre, Ether, Haliya and Keros were cast out of the heavens for remaining neutral during the celestial civil war. They arrived in a strange, uninhabited land and claimed it for themselves. The bathalumans decided to name the new world, Encantadia.Working together, the deities transformed the barren land into a paradise, populating it with both offspring and creations like the many creatures that inhabit the Encantadian wilds to ease the pain of their exile.\nRelations between the masters of Encantadia were genial at first and the beings of Encantadia lived in harmony and unity devoid of malice, until Ether and Arde fell in love. They also got jealous of the many worshipers Emre has. They planned to get rid of Emre to be free from him by absorbing the powers of the Haliya and Keros. Enraged at the two for succumbing to their baser instincts and violating the terms of their exile, Emre cursed them by turning Ether into a giant snake for her treachery. Arde was banished to limbo, transformed into a dragon tasked to forever safeguard the boundaries between the world of the living and the world of the damned, Bala-ak. Emre likewise left Encantadia and made Devas, the world of the blessed dead, his home, leaving Ether to fend for herself. Keros and Haliya each put themselves in exile to be away from all the chaos. Keros lived alone in the island of Binyaan while Haliya lived on Encantadia's second moon. \nAbandoned and cursed, Ether raged for many days. Because of her horrific and feral form, most of the citizens of Encantadia grew to fear Ether and shunned her. Others, in awe of her new power and pity of her plight, came to worship the bathaluman, who in turn granted them her power and protection. They became the first citizens of the kingdoms that shall unite and will become the empire of Etheria.\nThe empire was made up of four Heras (royal houses), with the members of each house possessing a unique ability given by Ether associated with their house.\nHera Andal,the ruling royal house and Etheria's capital and residence of the Monarch, Empress Avria. It's denizens are known to have knowledge in black magic, dark arts and witchcraft and possess dominion over life and death through their extensive knowledge of the healing arts and sorcery.\nHera Volo, the royal house of Etheria's military and infantry that have special abilities in the category of time, space and speed (such as accelerating or enhancing the speed of their movements, teleportation, time travel and manipulation of time). It is headed by Etheria's military general, Hera Juvila. They made Etheria's greatest treasure, the Golden Hourglass that can be used for time-travel and to rewrite history. \nHera Sensa, the royal house of Etheria's scholars. They are psychics, mind readers, telepaths, and possess other powers or abilities involving the mind. It is headed by Avria's ever loyal adviser, Hera Andora.\nHera Ae-ga, the mysterious royal house composed of only women. They can manipulate and dictate emotions/feelings, they are also skilled in archery. They live in tree houses in Etheria's jungles. It is headed by Hera Odessa.\nThe four territories of Encantadia were once vassals of Etheria. Because of their might and power, Etherians became cruel and wanted to conquer the whole of Encantadia in the name of their goddess, Ether. The four territories banded together and with the help of Emre (through his gift, the Mother Gem), Etheria was destroyed completely and was forgotten from the memories of all encantados.\nBut Avria could not be defeated easily even as her empire succumbed, as the empress swore that Etheria would return to power by the blood and spirit of those who made her empire fall.\nMeanwhile, Etheria's most powerful weapon, the Golden Hourglass, was lost and ultimately forgotten as time passed.\nThrough the machinations of the goddess, Ether, by using the blood and spirit from the dead from the Great War, The prophecy was fulfilled and the Golden Hourglass was re-discovered. Etheria came back to the present time, Etheria rose again from the ashes and is becoming the mighty empire it used to be. They will try to merge their past glory into the present and change history. \nBut unlike before, the Etherians now know better. They now know that as long as the gemstones are in the hands of the fairies, they have no chance of winning but by using their personal weaknesses, it is easier to destroy the sisters and get their respective gemstones and by doing so their empire could be rebuilt again in the present.\nAlso their deity, Ether and her lover, Arde can finally usurp the divine throne of Emre in Devas. \nThe Herans of Etheria tricked the sisters into going against each other. The events will challenge the trust and loyalty of the sisters to each other and to their duty as protectors of the gems and their realm. The fate of their world rests in their unity, trust and love. The sisters must also convince the other exiled deities, the moon goddess, Haliya and the destruction deity, Keros to side with Emre in a celestial war while trying to find the next generation of Encantados that will be worthy to inherit the powers of the gemstones and the duty to protect their land.\n\nEncantadia is a term coined from the Filipino words \"enkanto\", \"enkanta\", \"enkantada\", or \"enkantado\" (which was in turn derived from the Spanish term encant(ad){o/a}) which means enchanted beings endowed with supernatural powers. The series was created by GMA Network, the same network that produced the fantasy-themed series \"Mulawin\" and \"Darna\". It was directed by Mark Reyes and Gil Tejada, Jr., and written by Suzette Doctolero. Originally, the series was intended as GMA Films' entry to the 2004 Metro Manila Film Festival but they later decided to make \"Encantadia\" a daily fantasy soap opera due to its huge production and budget. Encantadia was Doctolero's first head writing project with the network in 2005, and also served as her training for writing a fantasy story for the first time. According to her, it was inspired by the story of Maria Makiling, a \"diwata (fairy)\" in Philippine folklore, in four different persona. It was also inspired by different stories around the world combined into one. The first three installment were consecutively shown from 2005 to 2006. In 2010, a second saga or fourth installment was scheduled to be produced by GMA Network, but it was not push through until Atty Gozon, CEO of GMA Network pushed it back for 2012, but was scrapped. In 2015,the director, producer and the writer were given a go signal by the network to make the new Encantadia. In January 2016, it was announced that the fourth installment will be a reboot (often called as requel or retelling-sequel) of the old series.\n\nAccording to Mark Reyes, the sets of Encantadia in 2005 are located in various places in the Philippines. The Kingdom of Adamya is located at Calatagan, Batangas. The cave set of Hathorian Kingdom is located at the Kalinawan Cave in Tanay, Rizal. Lireo's forest is located at Daranak Falls and Batlag Falls in Rizal. A 1,900 square meter warehouse in Pasig City served as an indoor set with an improvised pond. The said warehouse was also a setting change for Lireo, Sapiro, Hera Andal, Hera Sensa and others. The Kingdom of Sapiro set is located inside the historic walled city of Intramuros (Old Manila) in the heart of Manila. In its second and third installment, the series used the same locations.\n\nIn 2016, a 3000 square meter warehouse in Makati City was converted to a set for the Lireo Kingdom and its forest. The fallen Sapiro Kingdom and the Island of Cassiopeia were shot in Fortune Island in Batangas. Another warehouse set was converted as the Kingdom of Hathoria, while the mortal world were shot in various locations around Manila. The forest of Encantadia were shot in Tanay, Rizal, Pundaquit in Zambales as well as Batlag Falls and Daranak Falls.\n\nThe main theme of the series is its own soundtrack titled \"Tadhana\"(destiny) described as a chant/hymn, composed and sung by Filipino folk singer Bayang Barrios. According to Barrios, when she arrived in the recording studio, the hymn structure was already done by Allan Feliciano. The chant's theme is inspired by a drought and deforestation. One of the factors that contributed to the success of the 2005 series is its musical scoring, it was highly commended in the 2005 Asian Television Awards for \"Best Original Music Score\". In the sequel, Etheria, aside from \"Tadhana\", Feliciano also arranged a soundtrack titled as \"Hade!!\" (to attack) which refer as the Etherian war song; sung also by Barrios. Unlike \"Tadhana\", it is a lyrical song formed in Enchanta. Based on the lyrics, the song is about the creation of Encantadia, the five kingdoms including Etheria, and warfare. In the end, the composer appears to question the unending violence in the land including the lack of love and peace. Sub-tracks were also included in the series such as \"Asshenti\", an Etherian love song sung by Barrios and the Lirean Hymn, \"Ivo\"(life) arranged by Ariel Hugo, which was sung by Karylle. In the 2016 series, it uses the main soundtrack \"Tadhana\", which was modernized and beat has been altered to a rock-twist to fit the new generation. Moreover, \"Ivo\" was also used as recorded by Gabbi Garcia.\n\n\"Ang Mahiwagang Puso\" (Enchanted Heart) written by Tats Faustino, sung by Karylle and Jerome John Hughes was used as a soundtrack to the original version of the series. Karylle also recorded \"Hiling\" (Wish) but was rarely used in the series. \"Pangarap ni Lira\" (Lira's wish), composed by Suzette Doctolero, arranged by Eric Torralba and sung by Jennylyn Mercado was also part of the soundtrack. Other soundtracks include \"Isang Bagong Mundo\" (A whole new world) performed by Jennylyn Mercado, arranged by Eric Torralba and written by Suzette Doctolero; \"Sa Pakpak ng Paru-paro\" (Fairy's Wings) composed by Mark A. Reyes and arranged by Eric Torralba.\n\n\"Maghihintay Ako\" (I'll Be Waiting), sung by Gabbi Garcia and Christian Bautista and \"Sa Pangarap Lang\" (Through a Dream) sung by Mikee Quintos are being used in the 2016 series. Mikee Quintos also recorded \"Ang Awit ni Lira\" (Lira's Hymn) for the requel.\n\nAccording to Mark Reyes, the sets of Encantadia in 2005 are located in various places in the Philippines.

Mikee Quintos also recorded \"Ang Awit ni Lira\" (Lira's Hymn) for the requel.\n\nEncantadia is an enchanted place in a different realm. All of the characters existing in this world are called \"Encantados\". It was discovered and created thousand years ago by five supernatural beings, Haliya, Arde, Emre, Keros and Ether who were referred to as \"bathala\" (Gods) on the present times. The world they created was settled upon by low-class working individuals called \"barbaro\". Because of this, the three Bathala created four classes of individuals: the \"diwata's\" (fairies) of Lireo Kingdom; mystical creatures of the Adamyan territory; the warriors and healers called \"sapiryans\" of the Sapiro Kingdom and the blacksmiths of the Hathoria Kingdom. The four kingdoms promised allegiance and worship to Emre, which caused Arde and Ether's jealousy and hatred, resulting to a plan to assassinate him. Emre discovered this plan and cursed both of them: Arde to become a dragon who was sent to guard \"valaak\"(hell) and Ether to turn into snake to forever remind her of being a traitor. With this, the encantados are divided between the gods resulting to factions. Some encantados followed Ether and established the fifth Kingdom of Encantadia called, \"Etheria\", which had later fallen due to the greed of their Queen Avria to conquer the whole Encantadia causing the rest to unite against their Kingdom.\n\n\n\n\nThe world of Encantadia is being powered and guarded by a powerful gem referred as \"Inang Brilyante\" (mother gem) protected by Cassiopeia, the first Queen of Lireo. The gem has powerful characteristics and abilities, and is considered as the most powerful weapon of Encantadia. With this, it is being sought by greedy encantados driving Cassiopeia to break it into four elemental gems that hold balance to the realm: fire, air, water and earth. She later handed them to the four kingdoms of Encantadia. King Arvak of Hathoria wanted to acquire all gems, starting a rebellion leading to the Great Encantadian War wherein he was killed. Prince Raquim of Sapiro was able to recover the fire and water gem from King Arvak, and decided to bring the two gems and the Sapiro's earth gem to Lireo for safekeeping. Since then, the four powerful gems are guarded by the Queen of Lireo who then handed them to her four offsprings: Pirena, the keeper of the fire gem; Amihan for the air gem, and Alena and Danaya for the water and earth gem respectively. On the 2016 series, a fifth gem was introduced as a result of Cassiopeia's intense breakage of the mother gem, which propelled to the sea shore wherein a lost mortal became the keeper.\n\n\nEncantadia uses a fictional language called \"Enchanta\". It was created and conceptualized by Suzette Doctolero to make the viewers feel that the world of Encantados be somehow realistic and genuine. Doctolero created its vocabulary from many Indo-European languages with some influences of Philippine languages especially Tagalog. It can be traced from words like \"corre\", to love (from the root \"cor\" meaning heart) and \"avoya\", to travel (voyage). The language is also notable of being spoken as it sounds like its from some kind of European country because of the tone and the phonotactics. Most characters from the Encantadia saga know how to speak Enchanta, but it was Cassiopeia that had spoken the language most in the whole series, from the fact that she is the first diwata (fairy) of Lireo and ancestor of all the royal-blooded diwatas.\n\nIn its known history, the world of Encantadia has seen four major wars (so there are minor wars like Sapiro-Hathorian war) that has broken and threatened the peace of the realm.\n\nThe story unfolds in Lireo, the kingdom where Ynang Reyna (Queen Mother) Minea lives with her daughters Amihan, Alena, Danaya, and Pirena. The four Sangg'res are tasked to be the new keepers of the brilliantes. Their skills in war and their powers as the royalty of the diwatas are believed to be the strength of Lireo. As long as the gemstones are kept properly, the balance of nature in Encantadia remains. But everything changed when Pirena, the oldest of the four Sang'gre's consumed by her greed and jealousy, plotted the downfall of her own sister Amihan who succeeded their mother as Queen. This resulted into the War of the four Gems, or the war between the Hathoria Kingdom and the rest. With this situation, Lira, the lost daughter of Amihan returned to Encantadia and tried to fulfill her mission of mending the broken relationships of the strong-willed gemstone keepers.\n\nBack when Encantadia was a young world, there was a great empire called Etheria, ruled by Reyna Avria, who wanted to control the neighboring kingdoms of Lireo, Sapiro, Adamya and Hathoria. However, the four kingdoms banded together and attempted to defeat the forces of Etheria in the Great Encantadian War. After Etheria had fallen, Avria swore that Etheria would return to power once the last Sang'gre is born. The prophecy was then fulfilled due to the birth of Cassandra. Etheria rose again from the ashes and in order to save the present, the four Sang'gres of Lireo travelled back to the past in ancient Encantadia, find the lost Sang'gre, and destroy the Ginintuang Orasan (Etheria's powerful weapon) to stop Avria's centuries-old plan to dominate the realm.\n\nThis chapter depicts the continuing story of the four \"Sang'gres\", Pirena, Amihan, Alena (now Queen of Sapiro) and Danaya (now Queen of Lireo) along with King Ybrahim of Sapiro, in the enchanted world of Encantadia, as they face the repercussions of their previous journey through Encantadia's history. The Four Herans of the Etherian Kingdom are plotting revenge against the Sang'gre's who, for the 2nd time took down their beloved Kingdom.\n\nAfter the Great Encantadian War that defeated Etheria, the three kingdoms were able to live in peace for a thousand years, but the day came when the Hathors (inhabitants of Hathoria), led by King Arvak, gave in to their greed and started the Lirean war to claim the other gems, that they may gain power and rule over the whole continent. Later, King Arvak was killed by a Sapirian warrior named Asval but before he died, prince Raquim of Sapiro claimed the Gemstones of Water, Earth and Fire from him and handed them to the Queen of Lireo for safekeeping. The four gems have not been separated since. Two Thousand years have passed and the story unfolds in Lireo, where Queen Mine-a chose her successor from her daughters Pirena, Amihan, Alena and Danaya because they feel imminent danger lurking, and as the gods called her to Devas (the world of the dead), she has to leave the kingdom of Lireo in good and capable hands. She put her daughters to the test to see their capabilities and know who is best fit to be the next queen. Mine-a chose and crowned Amihan, which to Pirena's dismay, led to her rebellion and the onset of the so-called War of the four Gems. The chain of events that transpired made way for the separation of the gemstones. Pirena, after having stolen the gemstone of fire, sided with the Hathors and gave them back the power they've lost.Pirena then fools her sisters and ruled over Lireo, she bore a daughter named Mira while Amihan bore Lira who then took refuge in the mortal world. There were numerous times Ether helped Hathoria in defeating Lireo, but failed to succeed at. The last fight of Hathoria and Lireo resulted to the death of Queen Amihan, and Pirena's reunion with her other sisters. Danaya succeeded Amihan to the throne of Lireo, Ybrahim took oath as King of Sapiro while Pirena rebuilt Hathoria and became queen. The five gems were merged into one, but new threat had come to their land.\n\n\nPirena uses the \"gintong binhi\"(golden seed) to bring Ravenum back to life. Ravenum summons the dragon \"Buwarka\" and raises an army of Ravenas to wreak havoc on Avila territory. With the power of Mulawin's \"Tree of Life\" dwindling down and the Mulawin race in peril, the Diwatas of Encantadia and the \"Tres Aves\" (a legendary trio of heroes with special abilities) rushed to aid the Mulawin. The Mulawins and the Lireo soldiers led by Ybarro/Ybrahim faces the Ravenas until they defeated them. They return to Avila after a victory and a deadly battle. Aguiluz is seen lying in a royal bed in Lireo with Queen Amihan putting the \"gintong binhi\" to his mouth that can get his life back.\n\nEncantadia series are broadcast by GMA Network in the Philippines and through its international subsidiaries like GMA Pinoy TV in other countries.

Here, patients who want to escape the stresses of life are hypnotized, then laid out in morgue like drawers and left to dream for several weeks. It turns out that Dr. Zakon, the clinic's ex-Nazi owner, is using a \"dream machine\" to alter the sleepers dreams, and to impose his will on theirs.\n\n\nProducer Richard Gordon later said there were major problems with the film's special effects. He also said that he had a dispute with Anglo Amalgamated, who did not want the movie to get an X Certificate in England whereas Gordon wanted more horror for the US.\n\nLeonard Maltin called it a \"blah sci-fi programmer\" ; while TV Guide noted, \"an intriguing feature in that it was among the first to examine the possibilities of psychological manipulation and brainwashing.\" \n\n"}

She was also a pioneering medical practitioner, researcher and social reformer – and the first female doctor to be registered in Wales. She and her husband opened the first husband-and-wife medical practice in Britain.\n\nFrances Hoggan was born in Brecon, Wales, where her father, Richard Morgan, was a curate. She was brought up and educated at Cowbridge in Glamorgan and later at Windsor. During her teens, she gave birth to an illegitimate daughter, who was brought up with her mother and passed off as Frances' sister. She went on to study at Paris and Düsseldorf. \n\nShe obtained her medical doctorate from the University of Zurich in March 1870, completing the six-year course in three years, becoming the first British woman to obtain a European MD degree. In 1874 she married Dr George Hoggan. She later practised in London as a specialist in women's and children's diseases, including a period at North London Collegiate School. Together with her husband, she opened the first husband-and-wife general medical practice in the UK. \n\nIn 1882, she called for a publicly funded women's medical service for female patients in India. This helped pave the way for the Dufferin Fund.\n\nHoggan became a campaigner and social reformer, and toured the United States lecturing. She had a particular interest in racial issues, and was a speaker at the Universal Race Congress in London in 1911.\n\nHer cremated remains are buried, with her husband's, in Woking cemetery.\n\nUpon the exclusion of women by the Council of the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries from its professional exams in 1867, Frances Elizabeth Morgan sought her medical education at the University of Zurich, whence Nadezhda Suslova, Russia's first woman physician, had received her degree in December 1867. There, Morgan completed the medical course in three years rather than the expected five, and in March 1870 became only the second woman to gain an MD (with a thesis on progressive muscular atrophy) at Zürich University. Afterwards, at a clinic in Vienna she undertook study on operative midwifery and became a pupil of surgeon Gustav Braun.\n\n\nThe Learned Society of Wales awards the \"Frances Hoggan Medal\" to outstanding women connected with Wales in the areas of science, medicine, engineering, technology or mathematics.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "427926", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=427926", "title": "Ghazal", "text": "Ghazal\n\nThe ghazal ( , , , , , ) is a form of amatory poem or ode, originating in Arabic poetry. A ghazal may be understood as a poetic expression of both the pain of loss or separation and the beauty of love in spite of that pain. \n\nA ghazal commonly consists of between five and fifteen couplets, which are independent, but are linked – abstractly, in their theme; and more strictly in their poetic form. The structural requirements of the ghazal are similar in stringency to those of the Petrarchan sonnet. In style and content, due to its highly allusive nature, the ghazal has proved capable of an extraordinary variety of expression around its central themes of love and separation. \n\nThe ghazal is one of the most widespread and popular poetic forms, especially across the Middle East and South Asia. In India, Jagjit Singh, popularly known as \"The Ghazal King\" , popularize ghazals and ghazal singing among crores of music lovers . Readings or musical renditions of Ghazals are well attended in these countries, even by the laity. In a similar manner to Haiku, the Ghazal is gaining popularity among western poetry readers.\n\nThe Arabic word \"ġazal\" is pronounced , roughly like the English word \"guzzle\", but with the \"ġ\" pronounced without a complete closure between the tongue and the soft palate. In English, the word is pronounced or .\n\nThe ghazal originated in Arabia in the 7th century, evolving from the \"qasida\", a much older pre-Islamic Arabic poetic form. \"Qaṣīdas\" were typically much longer poems, with up to 100 couplets. Thematically, \"qaṣīdas\" did not include love, and were usually panegyrics for a tribe or ruler, lampoons, or moral maxims. However, the \"qaṣīda's\" opening prelude, called the \"nasīb,\" was typically nostalgic and/or romantic in theme, and highly ornamented and stylized in form. In time, the \"nasīb\" began to be written as standalone, shorter poems, which became the ghazal.\n\nThe ghazal came into its own as a poetic genre during the Ummayyad Era (661–750) and continued to flower and develop in the early Abbasid Era. The Arabic ghazal inherited the formal verse structure of the \"qaṣīda\", specifically, a strict adherence to meter and the use of the Qaafiyaa, a common end rhyme on each couplet (called a \"bayt\" in Arabic and a \"sher\" in Persian).\n\nThe nature of the ghazals also changed to meet the demands of musical presentation, becoming briefer in length. Lighter poetic meters, such as \"khafîf\", \"ramal\", and \"muqtarab\" were preferred, instead of longer, more ponderous meters favored for \"qaṣīdas\" (such as \"kâmil\", \"basît\", and \"rajaz\"). Topically, the ghazal focus also changed from nostalgic reminisces of the homeland and loved-ones, towards romantic or erotic themes – These included sub-genres with themes of courtly love (\"udharî\"), eroticism (\"hissî\"), homoeroticism (\"mudhakkar\"), and as a highly stylized introduction to a larger poem (\"tamhîdî\").\n\nWith the spread of Islam, the Arabian ghazal spread both westwards, into Africa and Spain, as well as eastwards, into Persia. The popularity of ghazals in a particular region was usually preceded by a spread of the Arabic language in that country. In medieval Spain, ghazals written in Hebrew as well as Arabic have been found as far back the 11th century. It is possible that ghazals were also written in the Mozarabic language. Ghazals in the Arabic form have also been written in a number of major West African literary languages like Hausa and Fulfulde.\n\nHowever, the most significant changes to the ghazal occurred in its introduction into Iran in the 10th century. The early Persian ghazals largely imitated the themes and form of the Arabian ghazal. These \"Arabo-Persian\" ghazals introduced two differences compared to their Arabian poetic roots. Firstly, the Persian ghazals did not employ radical enjambment between the two halves of the couplet, and secondly, the Persian ghazals formalized the use of the common rhyme in both lines of the opening couplet (\"matla\"). The imitation of Arabian forms in Persia extended to the \"qaṣīda\", which was also popular in Persia. \n\nBecause of its comparative brevity, thematic variety and suggestive richness, the ghazal soon eclipsed the \"qaṣīda\", and became the most popular poetry form in Persia. Much like Arabian ghazals, early Persian ghazals typically employed more musical meters compared to other Persian poetry forms. Rudaki (858–941 CE) is considered the most important Persian ghazal poet of this period, and the founder of classical Persian literature. \n\nThe Persian ghazal evolved into its own distinctive form between the 12th and 13th centuries. Many of those innovations created what we now recognize as the archetypical ghazal form. These changes occurred in two periods, separated by the Mongol Invasion of Persia from 1219–1221 AD. \n\nThe 'Early Persian poetry' period spanned approximately one century, from the Ghaznavid era (which lasted until 1187) till a little after the Mongol Invasion. Apart from the movement towards brevity, this period also saw two significant and lasting changes to the ghazal form. \n\nThe first change was the adoption of the \"Takhallus\", the practice of mentioning the poet's pen-name in the final couplet (called the maqta). The adoption of the \"takhallus\" became a gradually accepted part of the ghazal form, and by the time of Saadi Shirazi (1210–1291 AD), the most important ghazal poet of this period, it had become \"de rigueur.\" The second marked change from Arabian ghazal form in Persian ghazals was a movement towards far greater autonomy between the couplets.\n\nThe ghazal later spread throughout the Middle East and South Asia. It was famous all around the Indian subcontinent in the 18th and 19th centuries \n\nThe ghazal was spread from Persia into South Asia in the 12th century by the influence of Sufi mystics and the courts of the new Islamic sultanates. This period coincided with the early Islamic Sultanates in India, through the wave of Islamic invasions into the region in that period. The 13th century poet and musician Ameer Khusrow is considered the first Urdu poet. \n\nAlthough the ghazal is most prominently a form of Dari and Urdu poetry, it is now found in the poetry of many languages on the Indian subcontinent.\n\nAll the lines of a ghazal have the same meter. It is common in ghazals for the poet's name (known as takhallus) to be featured in the last verse (a convention known as the maqta).\n\nThe ghazal was initially composed to a purely religious theme. Now it is more likely to lean towards romantic themes. \n\nCan usually be interpreted for a higher being or for a mortal beloved. Love is always viewed as something that will complete a human being, and if attained will lift him or her into the ranks of the wise, or will bring satisfaction to the soul of the poet. Traditional ghazal law may or may not have an explicit element of sexual desire in it, and the love may be spiritual. The love may be directed to either a man or a woman.\n\nThe ghazal is always written from the point of view of the unrequited lover whose beloved is portrayed as unattainable. Most often, either the beloved has not returned the poet's love or returns it without sincerity or else the societal circumstances do not allow it. The lover is aware and resigned to this fate but continues loving nonetheless; the lyrical impetus of the poem derives from this tension. Representations of the lover's powerlessness to resist his feelings often include lyrically exaggerated violence. The beloved's power to captivate the speaker may be represented in extended metaphors about the \"arrows of his eyes\", or by referring to the beloved as an assassin or a killer. Take, for example, the following couplets from Amir Khusro's Persian ghazal \"Nami danam chi manzil buud shab\":\nMany of the major historical ghazal poets were either avowed Sufis themselves (like Rumi or Hafiz), or were sympathizers with Sufi ideas. Most ghazals can be viewed in a spiritual context, with the Beloved being a metaphor for God or the poet's spiritual master. It is the intense Divine Love of Sufism that serves as a model for all the forms of love found in ghazal poetry.\n\nMost ghazal scholars today recognize that some ghazal couplets are exclusively about Divine Love (ishq-e-haqiqi). Others are about \"earthly love\" (ishq-e-majazi), but many of them can be interpreted in either context.\nTraditionally invoking melancholy, love, longing, and metaphysical questions, ghazals are often sung by Afghan, Pakistani, and Indian musicians. The form has roots in seventh-century Arabia, and gained prominence in the thirteenth- and fourteenth-century, thanks to such Persian poets as Rumi and Hafiz, and later to Indian poets such as Mirza Ghalib. In the eighteenth-century, the ghazal was used by poets writing in Urdu. Among these poets, Ghalib is the recognized master.\n\nGhazals were written by Rumi, Hafiz and Saadi Shirazi of Persia; the Azerbaijani Turkish poet Fuzûlî in the Ottoman Empire; Mirza Ghalib and Muhammad Iqbal of North India; and Kazi Nazrul Islam of Bengal. Through the influence of Goethe (1749–1832), the ghazal became very popular in Germany during the 19th century; the form was used extensively by Friedrich Rückert (1788–1866) and August von Platen (1796–1835). The Kashmiri poet Agha Shahid Ali was a proponent of the form, both in English and in other languages; he edited a volume of \"real Ghazals in English\". Ghazals were also written by Moti Ram Bhatta (1866–1896), the pioneer of Nepali ghazal writing in Nepali. Ghazals were also written by Hamza Shinwari, He is known as the father of Pashto Ghazals\n\nIn Persian, prominent and acclaimed ghazal poets include Hafiz, Rumi, Saadi Shirazi, Fakhr-al-Din Iraqi, Khwaju Kermani, Saib Tabrizi, Hossein Monzavi, Maryam Jafari Azarmani, Wali Mohammed Wali, Mirza Ghalib, Mir Taqi Mir, Momin Khan Momin, Daagh Dehlvi, Khwaja Haidar Ali Aatish, Jan Nisar Akhtar, Khwaja Mir Dard, Jaun Elia, Faiz Ahmad Faiz, Ahmad Faraz, Firaq Gorakhpuri, Muhammad Iqbal, Syed Amin Ashraf, Qamar Jalalabadi, Shakeb Jalali, Nasir Kazmi, Sahir Ludhianvi, Hasrat Mohani, Makhdoom Mohiuddin, Jigar Moradabadi, Saghar Siddiqui, Munir Niazi, Mirza Rafi Sauda, Qateel Shifai, Majrooh Sultanpuri, Dushyant Kumar, Syed Waheed Ashraf, Mohammad Ibrahim Zauq, Madan Pal and Kashmiri Lal Zakir.\nEnormous collections of ghazal have been created by hundreds of well-known poets over the past thousand years in Persian, Turkish, and Urdu as well as in the Central Asian Turkic languages. Ghazal poems are performed in Uzbek-Tajik Shashmakom, Turkish Makam, Persian Dastgah and Uyghur Muqam. There are many published translations from Persian and Turkish by Annemarie Schimmel, Arthur John Arberry and many others.\n\nGhazal \"Gayaki\", the art of singing or performing the ghazal in the Indian classical tradition, is very old. Singers like Ustad Barkat Ali and many other singers in the past used to practice it, but the lack of historical records make many names anonymous. It was with Begum Akhtar and later on Ustad Mehdi Hassan that classical rendering of ghazals became popular in the masses. The categorization of ghazal singing as a form of \"light classical\" music is a misconception.\n\nClassical ghazals are difficult to render because of the varying moods of the \"shers\" or couplets in the ghazal. Amanat Ali Khan, Begum Akhtar, Talat Mahmood, Mehdi Hassan, Abida Parveen, Jagjit Singh, Farida Khanum and Ustad Ghulam Ali, Moinuddin Ahamed, are popular classical ghazal singers.\n\nUnderstanding the complex lyrics of ghazals required education typically available only to the upper classes. The traditional classical \"rāgas\" in which the lyrics were rendered were also difficult to understand. The Ghazal has undergone some simplification in terms of words and phrasings, which helps it to reach a larger audience around the world. Most of the ghazals are now sung in styles that are not limited to \"khayāl, thumri, rāga, tāla\" and other classical and light classical genres.\n\nHowever, those forms of the ghazal are looked down on by purists of the Indian classical tradition. In Pakistan, Noor Jehan, Iqbal Bano, Abida Parveen, Farida Khanum, Ghulam Ali, Ahmed Rushdi, Ustad Amanat Ali Khan and Mehdi Hassan are known for ghazal renditions. Singers like Jagjit Singh (who first used a guitar in ghazals), Ahmed and Mohammed Hussain, Hariharan, Adithya Srinivasan, Mohammad Rafi, Pankaj Udhas, Satyam Anandjee and many others have been able to give a new shape to the ghazal by incorporating elements of Western music.\n\nIn North India, in addition to Hindustani, ghazals have been very popular in the Gujarati language. For around a century, starting with Balashankar Kantharia, there have been many notable Gujarati ghazal writers like Kalapi, Barkat Virani 'Befaam', Aasim Randeri, Shunya Palanpuri, Amrut Ghayal, Khalil Dhantejvi and many more. Some notable ghazals of those prominent writers have been sung by Bollywood playback singer Manhar Udhas.\n\nRenowned ghazal singer, and pioneer of Telugu ghazals, Ghazal Srinivas popularized the ghazal in Telugu. Srinivas also introduced ghazal singing in Kannada, and Ghazals in Kannada were written by Markandapuram Srinivas.\n\nThe first true-to-form Bangla (Bengali) ghazal are published in \"gajaler aayanaay\" by British Dashgupta.\n\nThe Canadian classical ghazal singer Cassius Khan has the unusual talent of singing in the recitational style while accompanying himself on the tabla.\n\nAfter nearly a century of \"false starts\", the early experiments of James Clarence Mangan, James Elroy Flecker, Adrienne Rich, Phyllis Webb, etc., many of whom did not adhere wholly or in part to the traditional principles of the form, experiments dubbed as \"the bastard Ghazal\", the ghazal finally began to be recognized as a viable closed form in poetry of the English language some time in the early to mid-1990s. It came about largely as a result of serious, true-to-form examples being published by noted American poets John Hollander, W. S. Merwin and Elise Paschen as well as by Kashmiri-American poet Agha Shahid Ali, who had been teaching and spreading word of the Ghazal at American universities over the previous two decades. Jim Harrison created his own free-form Ghazal true to his poetic vision in \"Outlyer and Ghazals\" (1971).\n\nIn 1996, Ali compiled and edited the world's first anthology of English-language Ghazals, published by Wesleyan University Press in 2000, as \"Ravishing DisUnities: Real Ghazals in English\". (Fewer than one in ten of the ghazals collected in \"Real Ghazals in English\" observe the constraints of the form.) Devi Panthi of Nepal started composing ghazals claiming himself the pioneer of English ghazals since 2006.\n\nA ghazal is composed of couplets, five or more. The couplets may have nothing to do with one another except for the formal unity derived from a strict rhyme and rhythm pattern.\n\nA ghazal in English observes the traditional restrictions of the form:\n\nWhere are you now? Who lies beneath your spell tonight?\nWhom else from rapture's road will you expel tonight?\n\nThose \"Fabrics of Cashmere—\" \"to make Me beautiful—\"\n\"Trinket\"— to gem– \"Me to adorn– How– tell\"— tonight?\n\nI beg for haven: Prisons, let open your gates–\nA refugee from Belief seeks a cell tonight.\n\nGod's vintage loneliness has turned to vinegar–\nAll the archangels– their wings frozen– fell tonight.\n\nLord, cried out the idols, Don't let us be broken\nOnly we can convert the infidel tonight.\n\nMughal ceilings, let your mirrored convexities\nmultiply me at once under your spell tonight.\n\nHe's freed some fire from ice in pity for Heaven.\nHe's left open– for God– the doors of Hell tonight.\n\nIn the heart's veined temple, all statues have been smashed\nNo priest in saffron's left to toll its knell tonight\n\nGod, limit these punishments, there's still Judgment Day–\nI'm a mere sinner, I'm no infidel tonight.\n\nExecutioners near the woman at the window.\nDamn you, Elijah, I'll bless Jezebel tonight.\n\nThe hunt is over, and I hear the Call to Prayer\nfade into that of the wounded gazelle tonight.\n\nMy rivals for your love– you've invited them all?\nThis is mere insult, this is no farewell tonight.\n\nAnd I, Shahid, only am escaped to tell thee–\nGod sobs in my arms.

{"id": "2836229", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2836229", "title": "Gibberish (language game)", "text": "Gibberish (language game)\n\nGibberish (sometimes Jibberish) is a language game that is played in the United States, Canada and Ireland. Similar games are played in many other countries. The name Gibberish refers to the nonsensical sound of words spoken according to the rules of this game.\n\nThere are several variations of Gibberish in the English-speaking world. They use \"-itherg-\", \"-uthug-\", \"-elag-\", \"-itug-\", \"-uthaga-\", \"-uvug-\", \"-idig-\", \"-atheg-\" (\"th\" in \"then\" and the two vowels are pronounced with a schwa), and \"-adeg-\". The dialects are given different names. Another form of gibberish known as allibi is spoken using the insertion \"-allib-\".\n\nThese four dialects of Gibberish are spoken by adding the infix to each syllable after the onset. Example:\nWhen a syllable starts with more than one consonant, the infix is added after the onset consonants. Example:\nWhen the syllable begins with a vowel, that vowel is used in place of the first \"i\" in the \"-ithieg-\" infix. Example:\nWords of more than one syllable repeat the rules for each syllable.\n\nThis dialect works in much the same way as the previous dialects, with an additional rule. When a single syllable word begins with a vowel, the infix acts as a prefix, with the initial \"a\" becoming like that vowel.\nThe sentence \"I hit the alarm clock when I woke up\" could be \"Ittiguy Hittigit thittagee addagalitigarm clidigock wittigen Ittiguy wittigoke uttigup\".\n\nAnother paradigm involves infixing \"(V)rV+g\" following the onset of a monosyllabic word, or less usually after each onset or nucleus of polysyllabic words. In words consisting of a single diphthong, the Gibberish morpheme breaks up the syllable into a sequence of vowels plus a glide. The vowels of the Gibberish morpheme typically harmonize for quality with the vowel of the syllable nucleus, but can be reduced if unstressed according to English stress rules. The syllabifies into a new onset. Examples:\n\n\nL can also be commonly used instead of r. Examples:\n\n\nThe term \"gibberish\" is used more generally to refer to all language games created by inserting a certain infix before the vowel in each syllable. For example, if the code infix were \"ob\", then \"Hello, Thomas\" would be translated as \"Hobellobo, Thobomobas\". While a relatively simple code, this can be difficult to understand when spoken swiftly and sounds merely like meaningless babble, which is how it received its name. The terms \"Double Talk\" and \"Double Dutch\" are alternate names for such codes. While any syllables could be used as code syllables, some syllables are more commonly used. These include:\n\n\nAnother variation consists in the code syllables not having a specific vowel, but repeating the vowel of the syllable in which it is being inserted. This variation is common in Switzerland, where the inserted syllable thus could be \"@n@f\", where \"@\" denotes the original vowel; e.g. \"Hallo, Chrige\" would be translated into \"Hanafallonofo, Chrinifigenefe\". Similarly, \"Lalafa\" replaces each occurrence of a vowel with \"@ləf@.\" In Gibberish as spoken in the United Kingdom, the infix code syllable is often \"@rag\".\n\nIn some variants only the first syllable of each word is modified. On the other hand, combining (or double-encoding) forms of Gibberish, or by further encoding with other languages games such as Pig Latin and Tutnese can result in increasingly hard to decipher (and pronounce) words. For instance, combining Pig Latin, Hard Gibberish and Openglopish might result in a phrase ('that sounds like this').\n\nLanguage games in the Gibberish family are not unique to English-speaking countries. Gibberish games in other languages include:\n\n"}
{"id": "11985", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11985", "title": "Graffiti", "text": "Graffiti\n\nGraffiti (both singular and plural; the singular \"graffito\" is very rare in English except in archeology) is writing or drawings made on a wall or other surface, usually without permission and within public view. Graffiti ranges from simple written words to elaborate wall paintings, and it has existed since ancient times, with examples dating back to ancient Egypt, ancient Greece, and the Roman Empire.\n\nIn modern times, paint (particularly spray paint) and marker pens have become the most commonly used graffiti materials. In most countries, marking or painting property without the property owner's permission is considered defacement and vandalism, which is a punishable crime.\n\nGraffiti may also express underlying social and political messages and a whole genre of artistic expression is based upon spray paint graffiti styles. Within hip hop culture, graffiti have evolved alongside hip hop music, b-boying, and other elements. Unrelated to hip-hop graffiti, gangs use their own form of graffiti to mark territory or to serve as an indicator of gang-related activities.\n\nControversies that surround graffiti continue to create disagreement amongst city officials, law enforcement, and writers who wish to display and appreciate work in public locations. There are many different types and styles of graffiti; it is a rapidly developing art form whose value is highly contested and reviled by many authorities while also subject to protection, sometimes within the same jurisdiction.\n\nBoth \"graffiti\" and its occasional singular form \"graffito\" are from the Italian word \"graffiato\" (\"scratched\"). \"Graffiti\" is applied in art history to works of art produced by scratching a design into a surface. A related term is \"sgraffito\", which involves scratching through one layer of pigment to reveal another beneath it. This technique was primarily used by potters who would glaze their wares and then scratch a design into it. In ancient times graffiti were carved on walls with a sharp object, although sometimes chalk or coal were used. The word originates from Greek —\"graphein\"—meaning \"to write\".\n\nThe term \"graffiti\" referred to the inscriptions, figure drawings, and such, found on the walls of ancient sepulchres or ruins, as in the Catacombs of Rome or at Pompeii. Use of the word has evolved to include any graphics applied to surfaces in a manner that constitutes vandalism.\n\nThe only known source of the Safaitic language, a form of proto-Arabic, is from graffiti: inscriptions scratched on to the surface of rocks and boulders in the predominantly basalt desert of southern Syria, eastern Jordan and northern Saudi Arabia. Safaitic dates from the first century BC to the fourth century AD.\n\nThe first known example of \"modern style\" graffiti survives in the ancient Greek city of Ephesus (in modern-day Turkey). Local guides say it is an advertisement for prostitution. Located near a mosaic and stone walkway, the graffiti shows a handprint that vaguely resembles a heart, along with a footprint, a number, and a carved image of a woman's head. This is believed to indicate that a brothel was nearby, with the handprint symbolizing payment.\n\nThe ancient Romans carved graffiti on walls and monuments, examples of which also survive in Egypt. Graffiti in the classical world had different connotations than they carry in today's society concerning content. Ancient graffiti displayed phrases of love declarations, political rhetoric, and simple words of thought, compared to today's popular messages of social and political ideals\nThe eruption of Vesuvius preserved graffiti in Pompeii, which includes Latin curses, magic spells, declarations of love, alphabets, political slogans, and famous literary quotes, providing insight into ancient Roman street life. One inscription gives the address of a woman named Novellia Primigenia of Nuceria, a prostitute, apparently of great beauty, whose services were much in demand. Another shows a phallus accompanied by the text, \"mansueta tene\" (\"handle with care\").\n\nDisappointed love also found its way onto walls in antiquity:\n\nAncient tourists visiting the 5th-century citadel at Sigiriya in Sri Lanka scribbled over 1800 individual graffiti there between the 6th and 18th centuries. Etched on the surface of the Mirror Wall, they contain pieces of prose, poetry, and commentary. The majority of these visitors appear to have been from the elite of society: royalty, officials, professions, and clergy. There were also soldiers, archers, and even some metalworkers. The topics range from love to satire, curses, wit, and lament. Many demonstrate a very high level of literacy and a deep appreciation of art and poetry. Most of the graffiti refer to the frescoes of semi-nude females found there. One reads:\n\n<poem>Wet with cool dew drops\nfragrant with perfume from the flowers\ncame the gentle breeze\njasmine and water lily\ndance in the spring sunshine\nside-long glances\nof the golden-hued ladies\nstab into my thoughts\nheaven itself cannot take my mind\nas it has been captivated by one lass\namong the five hundred I have seen here.</poem>\n\nAmong the ancient political graffiti examples were Arab satirist poems. Yazid al-Himyari, an Umayyad Arab and Persian poet, was most known for writing his political poetry on the walls between Sajistan and Basra, manifesting a strong hatred towards the Umayyad regime and its \"walis\", and people used to read and circulate them very widely.\n\nHistoric forms of graffiti have helped gain understanding into the lifestyles and languages of past cultures. Errors in spelling and grammar in these graffiti offer insight into the degree of literacy in Roman times and provide clues on the pronunciation of spoken Latin. Examples are \"CIL\" IV, 7838: \"Vettium Firmum / aed\"[ilem] \"quactiliar\"[ii] \"rog\"[ant]. Here, \"qu\" is pronounced \"co\". The 83 pieces of graffiti found at \"CIL\" IV, 4706-85 are evidence of the ability to read and write at levels of society where literacy might not be expected. The graffiti appear on a peristyle which was being remodeled at the time of the eruption of Vesuvius by the architect Crescens. The graffiti were left by both the foreman and his workers. The brothel at \"CIL\" VII, 12, 18–20 contains more than 120 pieces of graffiti, some of which were the work of the prostitutes and their clients. The gladiatorial academy at \"CIL\" IV, 4397 was scrawled with graffiti left by the gladiator Celadus Crescens (\"Suspirium puellarum Celadus thraex\": \"Celadus the Thracian makes the girls sigh.\")\n\nAnother piece from Pompeii, written on a tavern wall about the owner of the establishment and his questionable wine:\n\n<poem>\nLandlord, may your lies malign\nBring destruction on your head!\nYou yourself drink unmixed wine,\nWater [do you] sell [to] your guests instead.</poem>\n\nIt was not only the Greeks and Romans who produced graffiti: the Maya site of Tikal in Guatemala contains examples of ancient Maya graffiti. Viking graffiti survive in Rome and at Newgrange Mound in Ireland, and a Varangian scratched his name (Halvdan) in runes on a banister in the Hagia Sophia at Constantinople. These early forms of graffiti have contributed to the understanding of lifestyles and languages of past cultures.\n\nGraffiti, known as Tacherons, were frequently scratched on Romanesque Scandinavian church walls.\nWhen Renaissance artists such as Pinturicchio, Raphael, Michelangelo, Ghirlandaio, or Filippino Lippi descended into the ruins of Nero's Domus Aurea, they carved or painted their names and returned to initiate the \"grottesche\" style of decoration.\n\nThere are also examples of graffiti occurring in American history, such as Independence Rock, a national landmark along the Oregon Trail.\n\nLater, French soldiers carved their names on monuments during the Napoleonic in the 1790s. Lord Byron's survives on one of the columns of the Temple of Poseidon at Cape Sounion in Attica, Greece.\n\nGraffiti writing is often intertwined with hip hop culture and the myriad international styles derived from Philadelphia and New York City Subway graffiti. However, there are many other instances of notable graffiti in the twentieth century. Graffiti have long appeared on building walls, in latrines, railroad boxcars, subways, and bridges. The oldest known example of modern graffiti is found on traincars created by hobos and railworkers started more than eighty years ago, called Bozo Texino, documented by filmmaker Bill Daniel in his 2005 film, \"Who is Bozo Texino?\".\n\nSome graffiti have their own poignancy. In World War II, an inscription on a wall at the fortress of Verdun was seen as an illustration of the US response twice in a generation to the wrongs of the Old World:\n\n<poem>\nAustin White – Chicago, Ill – 1918\nAustin White – Chicago, Ill – 1945\nThis is the last time I want to write my name here.</poem>\n\nDuring World War II and for decades after, the phrase \"Kilroy was here\" with an accompanying illustration was widespread throughout the world, due to its use by American troops and ultimately filtering into American popular culture. Shortly after the death of Charlie Parker (nicknamed \"Yardbird\" or \"Bird\"), graffiti began appearing around New York with the words \"Bird Lives\". The student protests and general strike of May 1968 saw Paris bedecked in revolutionary, anarchistic, and situationist slogans such as \"L'ennui est contre-révolutionnaire\" (\"Boredom is counterrevolutionary\") expressed in painted graffiti, poster art, and stencil art. At the time in the US, other political phrases (such as \"Free Huey\" about Black Panther Huey Newton) became briefly popular as graffiti in limited areas, only to be forgotten. A popular graffito of the early 1970s was \"Dick Nixon Before He Dicks You\", reflecting the hostility of the youth culture to that US president.\n\nRock and roll graffiti is a significant subgenre. A famous graffito of the twentieth century was the inscription in the London tube reading \"Clapton is God\" in a link to the guitarist Eric Clapton. The phrase was spray-painted by an admirer on a wall in an Islington station on the Underground in the autumn of 1967. The graffito was captured in a photograph, in which a dog is urinating on the wall.\n\nGraffiti also became associated with the anti-establishment punk rock movement beginning in the 1970s. Bands such as Black Flag and Crass (and their followers) widely stenciled their names and logos, while many punk night clubs, squats, and hangouts are famous for their graffiti. In the late 1980s the upside down Martini glass that was the tag for punk band Missing Foundation was the most ubiquitous graffito in lower Manhattan, and was copied by hard core punk fans throughout the US and West Germany.\n\nAlong similar lines was the legend \"Frodo Lives,\" referring to the protagonist of \"The Lord of the Rings\".\n\nIn 1979, graffiti artist Lee Quinones and Fab 5 Freddy were given a gallery opening in Rome by art dealer Claudio Bruni. For many outside of New York, it was their first encounter with their art form. Fab 5 Freddy's friendship with Debbie Harry influenced Blondie's single \"Rapture\" (Chrysalis, 1981), the video of which featured Jean-Michel Basquiat, and offered many their first glimpse of a depiction of elements of graffiti in hip hop culture. JaJaJa toured Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, and Holland with a large graffiti canvas as a backdrop. Charlie Ahearn's independently released fiction film \"Wild Style\" (Wild Style, 1983), the early PBS documentary \"Style Wars\" (1983), hit songs such as \"The Message\" and \"Planet Rock\" and their accompanying music videos (both 1982) contributed to a growing interest outside New York in all aspects of hip hop.\n\n\"Style Wars\" depicted not only famous graffiti artists such as Skeme, Dondi, MinOne, and ZEPHYR, but also reinforced graffiti's role within New York's emerging hip-hop culture by incorporating famous early break-dancing groups such as Rock Steady Crew into the film and featuring rap in the soundtrack. Although many officers of the New York City Police Department found this film to be controversial, Style Wars is still recognized as the most prolific film representation of what was going on within the young hip hop culture of the early 1980s. Fab 5 Freddy and Futura 2000 took hip hop graffiti to Paris and London as part of the New York City Rap Tour in 1983. Hollywood also paid attention, consulting writers such as PHASE 2 as it depicted the culture and gave it international exposure in movies such as \"Beat Street\" (Orion, 1984).\n\nThis period also saw the emergence of the new stencil graffiti genre. Some of the first examples were created in 1981 by graffiti artist Blek le Rat in Paris, in 1982 by Jef Aerosol in Tours (France); by 1985 stencils had appeared in other cities including New York City, Sydney, and Melbourne, where they were documented by American photographer Charles Gatewood and Australian photographer Rennie Ellis.\n\nPeople often leave their traces in wet cement or concrete. This type of graffito often commemorates the mutual commitment of a couple, or simply records a person's presence at a particular moment. Often this type of graffito is dated and is left untouched for decades, offering a look into local historical minutiae.\n\nWith the popularity and legitimization of graffiti has come a level of commercialization. In 2001, computer giant IBM launched an advertising campaign in Chicago and San Francisco which involved people spray painting on sidewalks a peace symbol, a heart, and a penguin (Linux mascot), to represent \"Peace, Love, and Linux.\" Due to laws forbidding it, some of the \"street artists\" were arrested and charged with vandalism, and IBM was fined more than US$120,000 for punitive damages and clean-up costs.\n\nIn 2005, a similar ad campaign was launched by Sony and executed by TATS CRU in New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and Miami, to market its handheld PSP gaming system. In this campaign, taking notice of the legal problems of the IBM campaign, Sony paid building owners for the rights to paint on their buildings \"a collection of dizzy-eyed urban kids playing with the PSP as if it were a skateboard, a paddle, or a rocking horse\".\n\nAlong with the commercial growth has come the rise of video games also depicting graffiti, usually in a positive aspect – for example, the \"Jet Set Radio\" series (2000–2003) tells the story of a group of teens fighting the oppression of a totalitarian police force that attempts to limit the graffiti artists' freedom of speech. In plotlines mirroring the negative reaction of non-commercial artists to the commercialization of the art form by companies such as IBM (and, later, Sony itself) the \"Rakugaki Ōkoku\" series (2003–2005) for Sony's PlayStation 2 revolves around an anonymous hero and his magically imbued-with-life graffiti creations as they struggle against an evil king who only allows art to be produced which can benefit him. Following the original roots of modern graffiti as a political force came another game title, \"\" (2006), featuring a story line involving fighting against a corrupt city and its oppression of free speech, as in the \"Jet Set Radio\" series.\n\nOther games which feature graffiti include \"Bomb the World\" (2004), an online graffiti simulation created by graffiti artist Klark Kent where users can paint trains virtually at 20 locations worldwide, and \"Super Mario Sunshine\" (2002), in which the hero, Mario must clean the city of graffiti left by the villain, Bowser Jr. in a plotline which evokes the successes of the Anti-Graffiti Task Force of New York's Mayor Rudolph Giuliani (a manifestation of the \"broken window theory\") or those of the \"Graffiti Blasters\" of Chicago's Mayor Richard M. Daley.\n\nNumerous other non-graffiti-centric video games allow the player to produce graffiti (such as the \"Half-Life\" series, the \"Tony Hawk's\" series, \"\", \"Rolling\", and \"\"). \"Counter-Strike\", which is a \"Half-Life\" mod, allows users to create their own graffiti tags to use in the game. Many other titles contain in-game depictions of graffiti, including \"The Darkness\", \"\", \"NetHack\", \"\", \"The World Ends with You\", \"The Warriors\", \"Just Cause\", \"Portal\", and various examples of Virtual Graffiti. There also exist games where the term \"graffiti\" is used as a synonym for \"drawing\" (such as \"Yahoo! Graffiti\", \"Graffiti\", etc.).\n\nMarc Ecko, an urban clothing designer, has been an advocate of graffiti as an art form during this period, stating that \"Graffiti is without question the most powerful art movement in recent history and has been a driving inspiration throughout my career.\"\n\nHenry Chalfant is one of the foremost advocates of modern graffiti, having produced the documentary film Style Wars and co-authored the books \"Subway Art\" and \"Spray Can Art\". His most recent work, \"Henry Chalfant's Graffiti Archive: New York City's Subway Art and Artists\" displays his over 800 photographs of New York City Subway Graffiti Art.\n\nKeith Haring was another well-known graffiti artist who brought Pop Art and graffiti to the commercial mainstream. In the 1980s, Haring opened his first Pop Shop: a store that offered everyone access to his works, which until then could only be found spray-painted on city walls. Pop Shop offered commodities such as bags and t-shirts. Haring explained that \"The Pop Shop makes my work accessible. It's about participation on a big level, the point was that we didn't want to produce things that would cheapen the art. In other words, this was still art as statement.\"\n\nGraffiti have become a common stepping stone for many members of both the art and design communities in North America and abroad. Within the United States graffiti artists such as Mike Giant, Pursue, Rime, Noah, and countless others have made careers in skateboard, apparel, and shoe design for companies such as DC Shoes, Adidas, Rebel8, Osiris, or Circa Meanwhile, there are many others such as DZINE, Daze, Blade, and The Mac who have made the switch to being gallery artists, often not even using their initial medium, spray paint.\n\nBut perhaps the greatest example of graffiti artists infiltrating mainstream pop culture is the French crew 123Klan. Founded as a graffiti crew in 1989 by Scien and Klor, 123Klan has gradually turned their hands to illustration and design while still maintaining their graffiti practice and style. In doing so they have designed and produced logos and illustrations, shoes, and fashion for the likes of Nike, Adidas, Lamborghini, Coca Cola, Stussy, Sony, Nasdaq, and more.\n\nThere is a significant graffiti tradition in South America, especially in Brazil. Within Brazil, São Paulo is a significant centre of inspiration for many graffiti artists worldwide.\n\nTristan Manco wrote that Brazil \"boasts a unique and particularly rich, graffiti scene ... [earning] it an international reputation as the place to go for artistic inspiration.\" Graffiti \"flourishes in every conceivable space in Brazil's cities.\" Artistic parallels \"are often drawn between the energy of São Paulo today and 1970s New York.\" The \"sprawling metropolis,\" of São Paulo has \"become the new shrine to graffiti;\" Manco alludes to \"poverty and unemployment ... [and] the epic struggles and conditions of the country's marginalised peoples,\" and to \"Brazil's chronic poverty,\" as the main engines that \"have fuelled a vibrant graffiti culture.\" In world terms, Brazil has \"one of the most uneven distributions of income. Laws and taxes change frequently.\" Such factors, Manco argues, contribute to a very fluid society, riven with those economic divisions and social tensions that underpin and feed the \"folkloric vandalism and an urban sport for the disenfranchised,\" that is South American graffiti art.\n\nProminent Brazilian graffiti artists include Os Gêmeos, Boleta, Nunca, Nina, Speto, Tikka, and T.Freak. Their artistic success and involvement in commercial design ventures has highlighted divisions within the Brazilian graffiti community between adherents of the cruder transgressive form of \"pichação\" and the more conventionally artistic values of the practitioners of \"grafite\".\n\nGraffiti in the Middle East is emerging slowly, with pockets of taggers operating in the various 'Emirates' of the United Arab Emirates, in Israel, and in Iran. The major Iranian newspaper \"Hamshahri\" has published two articles on illegal writers in the city with photographic coverage of Iranian artist A1one's works on Tehran walls. Tokyo-based design magazine, \"PingMag\", has interviewed A1one and featured photographs of his work. The Israeli West Bank barrier has become a site for graffiti, reminiscent in this sense of the Berlin Wall. Many graffiti artists in Israel come from other places around the globe, such as JUIF from Los Angeles and DEVIONE from London. The religious reference \"נ נח נחמ נחמן מאומן\" (\"Na Nach Nachma Nachman Meuman\") is commonly seen in graffiti around Israel.\n\nThere are also a large number of graffiti influences in Southeast Asian countries that mostly come from modern Western culture, such as Malaysia, where graffiti have long been a common sight in Malaysia's capital city, Kuala Lumpur. Since 2010, the country has begun hosting a street festival to encourage all generations and people from all walks of life to enjoy and encourage Malaysian street culture.\n\nThe modern-day graffiti artist can be found with an arsenal of various materials that allow for a successful production of a piece. This includes such techniques as scribing. However, spray paint in aerosol cans is the number one medium for graffiti. From this commodity comes different styles, technique, and abilities to form master works of graffiti. Spray paint can be found at hardware and art stores and comes in virtually every color.\n\nStencil graffiti, originating in the early 1980s (Blek le Rat, Jef Aerosol, Speedy Graphito, Miss Tic ... ) is created by cutting out shapes and designs in a stiff material (such as cardboard or subject folders) to form an overall design or image. The stencil is then placed on the \"canvas\" gently and with quick, easy strokes of the aerosol can, the image begins to appear on the intended surface. This method of graffiti is popular amongst artists because of its swift technique that requires very little time. Time is always a factor with graffiti artists due to the constant threat of being caught by law enforcement.\n\nModern graffiti art often incorporates additional arts and technologies. For example, Graffiti Research Lab has encouraged the use of projected images and magnetic light-emitting diodes (throwies) as new media for graffiti artists. Yarnbombing is another recent form of graffiti. Yarnbombers occasionally target previous graffiti for modification, which had been avoided among the majority of graffiti artists.\n\nSome of the most common styles of graffiti have their own names. A tag is the most basic writing of an artist's name; it is simply a handstyle. A graffiti writer's tag is his or her personalized signature. Tagging is often the example given when opponents of graffiti refer to any acts of handstyle graffiti writing (it is by far the most common form of graffiti). Tags can contain subtle and sometimes cryptic messages, and may incorporate the artist's crew initials or other letters.\n\nOne form of tagging, known as pissing, involves taking a refillable fire-extinguisher and replacing the contents with paint, allowing for tags as high as approximately . Aiming and keeping a handstyle steady in this form of tagging is very difficult, usually coming out wavy and sloppy.\n\nAnother form is the throw-up, also known as a bombing, which is normally painted very quickly with two or three colors, sacrificing aesthetics for speed. Throw-ups can also be outlined on a surface with one color. A piece is a more elaborate representation of the artist's name, incorporating more stylized letters, usually incorporating a much larger range of colors. This is more time-consuming and increases the likelihood of the artist getting caught. A blockbuster or roller is a large piece, almost always done in a block-shaped style, done simply to cover a large area solidly with two contrasting colors, sometimes with the whole purpose of blocking other writers from painting on the same wall. These are usually accomplished with extended paint rollers and gallons of cheap exterior paint.\n\nA more complex style is wildstyle, a form of graffiti usually involving interlocking letters and connecting points. These pieces are often harder to read by non-graffiti artists as the letters merge into one another in an often-undecipherable manner.\n\nSome artists also use self-adhesive stickers as a quick way to do catch ups. While certain critics from within graffiti culture consider this lazy, stickers can be quite detailed in their own right and often, are used in conjunction with other materials. Sticker tags are commonly executed on blank postage stickers, as these can easily be acquired with no cost on the writer's part.\n\nMany graffiti artists believe that doing complex pieces involves too great an investment of time to justify the practice. Doing a piece can take (depending on experience and size) from 30 minutes to months on end, as was the case for Saber MSK while working on the world's largest graffiti piece on the LA river.\n\nAnother graffiti artist can go over a piece in a matter of minutes with a simple throw-up. This was exemplified by the writer \"CAP\" in the documentary \"Style Wars\", who, other writers complain, ruins pieces with his quick throw ups. This became known as capping and often is done when there is a \"beef\", or conflict between writers.\n\nA number of recent examples of graffiti make use of hashtags.\n\nTheories on the use of graffiti by avant-garde artists have a history dating back at least to the Scandinavian Institute of Comparative Vandalism in 1961.\n\nMany contemporary analysts and even art critics have begun to see artistic value in some graffiti and to recognize it as a form of public art. According to many art researchers, particularly in the Netherlands and in Los Angeles, that type of public art is, in fact an effective tool of social emancipation or, in the achievement of a political goal.\n\nThe murals of Belfast and of Los Angeles offer another example of official recognition. In times of conflict, such murals have offered a means of communication and self-expression for members of these socially, ethnically, or racially divided communities, and have proven themselves as effective tools in establishing dialog and thus, of addressing cleavages in the long run. The Berlin Wall was also extensively covered by graffiti reflecting social pressures relating to the oppressive Soviet rule over the GDR.\n\nMany artists involved with graffiti are also concerned with the similar activity of stenciling. Essentially, this entails stenciling a print of one or more colors using spray-paint. Recognized while exhibiting and publishing several of her coloured stencils and paintings portraying the Sri Lankan Civil War and urban Britain in the early 2000s, graffiti artist Mathangi Arulpragasam, aka M.I.A., has also become known for integrating her imagery of political violence into her music videos for singles \"Galang\" and \"Bucky Done Gun\", and her cover art. Stickers of her artwork also often appear around places such as London in Brick Lane, stuck to lamp posts and street signs, she having become a muse for other graffiti artists and painters worldwide in cities including Seville. Graffiti artist John Fekner, called \"caption writer to the urban environment, adman for the opposition\" by writer Lucy Lippard, was involved in direct art interventions within New York City's decaying urban environment in the mid-1970s through the 1980s. Fekner is known for his word installations targeting social and political issues, stenciled on buildings throughout New York.\n\nGraffiti artists constantly have the looming threat of facing consequences for displaying their graffiti. Many choose to protect their identities and reputation by remaining anonymous.\n\nWith the commercialization of graffiti (and hip hop in general), in most cases, even with legally painted \"graffiti\" art, graffiti artists tend to choose anonymity. This may be attributed to various reasons or a combination of reasons. Graffiti still remains the one of four hip hop elements that is not considered \"performance art\" despite the image of the \"singing and dancing star\" that sells hip hop culture to the mainstream. Being a graphic form of art, it might also be said that many graffiti artists still fall in the category of the introverted archetypal artist.\n\nBanksy is one of the world's most notorious and popular street artists who continues to remain faceless in today's society. He is known for his political, anti-war stencil art mainly in Bristol, England, but his work may be seen anywhere from Los Angeles to Palestine. In the UK, Banksy is the most recognizable icon for this cultural artistic movement and keeps his identity a secret to avoid arrest. Much of Banksy's artwork may be seen around the streets of London and surrounding suburbs, although he has painted pictures throughout the world, including the Middle East, where he has painted on Israel's controversial West Bank barrier with satirical images of life on the other side. One depicted a hole in the wall with an idyllic beach, while another shows a mountain landscape on the other side. A number of exhibitions also have taken place since 2000, and recent works of art have fetched vast sums of money. Banksy's art is a prime example of the classic controversy: vandalism vs. art. Art supporters endorse his work distributed in urban areas as pieces of art and some councils, such as Bristol and Islington, have officially protected them, while officials of other areas have deemed his work to be vandalism and have removed it.\n\nPixnit is another artist who chooses to keep her identity from the general public. Her work focuses on beauty and design aspects of graffiti as opposed to Banksy's anti-government shock value. Her paintings are often of flower designs above shops and stores in her local urban area of Cambridge, Massachusetts. Some store owners endorse her work and encourage others to do similar work as well. \"One of the pieces was left up above Steve's Kitchen, because it looks pretty awesome\"- Erin Scott, the manager of New England Comics in Allston, Massachusetts.\n\nGraffiti often has a reputation as part of a subculture that rebels against authority, although the considerations of the practitioners often diverge and can relate to a wide range of attitudes. It can express a political practice and can form just one tool in an array of resistance techniques. One early example includes the anarcho-punk band Crass, who conducted a campaign of stenciling anti-war, anarchist, feminist, and anti-consumerist messages throughout the London Underground system during the late 1970s and early 1980s. In Amsterdam graffiti was a major part of the punk scene. The city was covered with names such as \"De Zoot\", \"Vendex\", and \"Dr Rat\". To document the graffiti a punk magazine was started that was called \"Gallery Anus\". So when hip hop came to Europe in the early 1980s there was already a vibrant graffiti culture.\n\nThe student protests and general strike of May 1968 saw Paris bedecked in revolutionary, anarchistic, and situationist slogans such as \"L'ennui est contre-révolutionnaire\" (\"Boredom is counterrevolutionary\") and \"Lisez moins, vivez plus\" (\"Read less, live more\"). While not exhaustive, the graffiti gave a sense of the 'millenarian' and rebellious spirit, tempered with a good deal of verbal wit, of the strikers.\n\nThe developments of graffiti art which took place in art galleries and colleges as well as \"on the street\" or \"underground\", contributed to the resurfacing in the 1990s of a far more overtly politicized art form in the subvertising, culture jamming, or tactical media movements. These movements or styles tend to classify the artists by their relationship to their social and economic contexts, since, in most countries, graffiti art remains illegal in many forms except when using non-permanent paint. Since the 1990s with the rise of Street Art, a growing number of artists are switching to non-permanent paints and non-traditional forms of painting for a variety of reasons—but primarily because is it difficult for the police to apprehend them and for the courts to sentence or even convict a person for a protest that is as fleeting and less intrusive than marching in the streets. In some communities, such impermanent works survive longer than works created with permanent paints because the community views the work in the same vein as that of the civil protester who marches in the street—such protest are impermanent, but effective nevertheless.\n\nIn some areas where a number of artists share the impermanence ideal, an informal competition develops: the length of time that a work escapes destruction is viewed as a measure of the respect the work garners in the community. A crude work that deserves little respect would be invariably removed immediately, while the most talented artists might have works last for days.\n\nContemporary practitioners, accordingly, have varied and often conflicting practices. Some individuals, such as Alexander Brener, have used the medium to politicize other art forms, and have used the prison sentences enforced on them as a means of further protest.\nThe practices of anonymous groups and individuals also vary widely, and practitioners by no means always agree with each other's practices. For example, the anti-capitalist art group the Space Hijackers did a piece in 2004 about the contradiction between the capitalistic elements of Banksy and his use of political imagery.\n\nOn top of the political aspect of graffiti as a movement, political groups and individuals may also use graffiti as a tool to spread their point of view. This practice, due to its illegality, has generally become favored by groups excluded from the political mainstream (e.g. far-left or far-right groups) who justify their activity by pointing out that they do not have the money – or sometimes the desire – to buy advertising to get their message across, and that a \"ruling class\" or \"establishment\" controls the mainstream press, systematically excluding the radical and alternative point of view. This type of graffiti can seem crude; for example fascist supporters often scrawl swastikas and other Nazi images.\n\nOne innovative form of graffiti that emerged in the UK in the 1970s was devised by the Money Liberation Front (MLF), essentially a loose affiliation of underground press writers such as the poet and playwright Heathcote Williams and magazine editor and playwright Jay Jeff Jones. They initiated the use of paper currency as a medium for counterculture propaganda, overprinting banknotes, usually with a John Bull printing set. Although short lived, the MLF was representative of London's Ladbroke Grove centered alternative and literary community of the period. The area was also a scene of considerable anti-establishment and humorous street graffiti, much of which is also produced by Williams. In 2009, following the elections in Iran, protesters (who regarded the electoral result as rigged) began to deface banknotes with slogans such as \"Death to the dictator\". In Colombia writing and drawing on banknotes has become increasingly popular, either to make political comments, for fun or as an artistic medium. The national government has run advertising campaigns in an attempt to discourage the practice. In the UK there have been signs of an MLF resurgence with a number of banknotes in circulation being over-marked with protest slogans such as \"Banks=Robbers\", relating to the perceived culpability of banks in the financial crisis.\n\nBoth sides of the conflict in Northern Ireland produce political graffiti. As well as slogans, Northern Irish political graffiti includes large wall paintings, referred to as \"murals\". Along with the flying of flags and the painting of kerb stones, the murals serve a territorial purpose, often associated with gang use. Artists paint them mostly on house gables or on the \"Peace Lines\", high walls that separate different communities.\n\nThe murals often develop over an extended period and tend to stylization, with a strong symbolic or iconographic content. Loyalist murals often refer to historical events dating from the war between James II and William III in the late seventeenth century, whereas Republican murals usually refer to the more recent troubles.\n\nTerritorial graffiti marks urban neighborhoods with tags and logos to differentiate certain groups from others. These images are meant to show outsiders a stern look at whose turf is whose. The subject matter of gang-related graffiti consists of cryptic symbols and initials strictly fashioned with unique calligraphies. Gang members use graffiti to designate membership throughout the gang, to differentiate rivals and associates and, most commonly, to mark borders which are both territorial and ideological.\n\nGraffiti has been used as a means of advertising both legally and illegally. Bronx-based TATS CRU has made a name for themselves doing legal advertising campaigns for companies such as Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Toyota, and MTV. In the UK, Covent Garden's Boxfresh used stencil images of a Zapatista revolutionary in the hopes that cross referencing would promote their store.\n\nTech Giants Hewlett Packard used graffiti company Graffiti Kings based in London to showcase the creative use for their Sprout computer by producing a video, during the video Hewlett Packard showed many pieces of graffiti art while the Graffiti Kings artist used the Sprout computer to draw digital graffiti. Smirnoff hired artists to use reverse graffiti (the use of high pressure hoses to clean dirty surfaces to leave a clean image in the surrounding dirt) to increase awareness of their product. Shepard Fairey rose to fame after his \"Andre the Giant Has a Posse\" sticker campaign, in which his art was plastered in cities throughout America.\n\nMany graffiti artists see legal advertising as no more than \"paid for and legalised graffiti\", and have risen against mainstream ads. The Graffiti Research Lab crew have gone on to target several prominent ads in New York as a means of making a statement against this practice.\n\nGraffiti may also be used as an offensive expression. This form of graffiti may be difficult to identify, as it is mostly removed by the local authority (as councils which have adopted strategies of criminalization also strive to remove graffiti quickly). Therefore, existing racist graffiti is mostly more subtle and at first sight, not easily recognized as \"racist\". It can then only be understood if one knows the relevant \"local code\" (social, historical, political, temporal, and spatial), which is seen as heteroglot and thus a 'unique set of conditions' in a cultural context.\nHence, the lack of obvious racist graffiti does not necessarily mean that there is none. By making the graffiti less explicit (as adapted to social and legal constraints), these drawings are less likely to be removed, but do not lose their threatening and offensive character.\n\nElsewhere, activists in Russia have used painted caricatures of local officials with their mouths as potholes, to show their anger about the poor state of the roads. In Manchester, England a graffiti artist painted obscene images around potholes, which often resulted in their being repaired within 48 hours.\n\nIn the early 1980s, the first art galleries to show graffiti artists to the public were Fashion Moda in the Bronx, Now Gallery and Fun Gallery, both in the East Village, Manhattan.\n\nA 2006 exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum displayed graffiti as an art form that began in New York's outer boroughs and reached great heights in the early 1980s with the work of Crash, Lee, Daze, Keith Haring, and Jean-Michel Basquiat. It displayed 22 works by New York graffiti artists, including Crash, Daze, and Lady Pink. In an article about the exhibition in the magazine \"Time Out\", curator Charlotta Kotik said that she hoped the exhibition would cause viewers to rethink their assumptions about graffiti. Terrance Lindall, an artist and executive director of the Williamsburg Art and Historic Center, said regarding graffiti and the exhibition:\n\n\"Graffiti is revolutionary, in my opinion\", he says, \"and any revolution might be considered a crime. People who are oppressed or suppressed need an outlet, so they write on walls—it's free.\"\n\nFrom the 1970s onwards, Burhan Dogancay photographed urban walls all over the world; these he then archived for use as sources of inspiration for his painterly works. The project today known as \"Walls of the World\" grew beyond even his own expectations and comprises about 30,000 individual images. It spans a period of 40 years across five continents and 114 countries. In 1982, photographs from this project comprised a one-man exhibition titled \"Les murs murmurent, ils crient, ils chantent...\" (The walls whisper, shout and sing ... ) at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris.\n\nIn Australia, art historians have judged some local graffiti of sufficient creative merit to rank them firmly within the arts. Oxford University Press's art history text \"Australian Painting 1788–2000\" concludes with a long discussion of graffiti's key place within contemporary visual culture, including the work of several Australian practitioners.\n\nBetween March and April 2009, 150 artists exhibited 300 pieces of graffiti at the Grand Palais in Paris — a clear acceptance of the art form into the French art world.\n\nMany graffiti artists have used their design talents in other artistic endeavors. In 2009 graffiti artist \"Scape\" published \"GRAFF; the Art & Technique of Graffiti\", the world's first book dedicated to displaying the full techniques of creating graffiti art. Other books that focus on graffiti include \"Faith of Graffiti\" by Norman Mailer, \"Trespass\" by Taschen press, and the comic book by Elite Gudz, \"Concrete Immortalz\", which has a graffiti artist as its main character.\n\nFigurines by KAWS, featuring icons of pop culture, often with crossed-out eyes, run in limited editions and sell for thousands of dollars. World-renowned street artist Banksy directed a film in 2010, \"Exit Through the Gift Shop\", which explored street art and commercialism.\n\nSpray paint has many negative environmental effects. The paint contains toxic chemicals, and the can uses chlorofluorocarbons or volatile hydrocarbon gases to spray the paint unto a surface. As an alternative, moss graffiti is starting to catch on, which uses moss to create text or images. The moss is glued onto a surface by means of beer, buttermilk, or yogurt combined with sugar.\n\nIn China, Mao Zedong in the 1920s used revolutionary slogans and paintings in public places to galvanise the country's communist revolution.\n\nIn Hong Kong, Tsang Tsou Choi was known as the \"King of Kowloon\" for his calligraphy graffiti over many years, in which he claimed ownership of the area. Now some of his work is preserved officially.\n\nIn Taiwan, the government has made some concessions to graffiti artists. Since 2005 they have been allowed to freely display their work along some sections of riverside retaining walls in designated \"Graffiti Zones\". From 2007, Taipei's department of cultural affairs also began permitting graffiti on fences around major public construction sites. Department head Yong-ping Lee (李永萍) stated, \"We will promote graffiti starting with the public sector, and then later in the private sector too. It's our goal to beautify the city with graffiti\". The government later helped organize a graffiti contest in Ximending, a popular shopping district. Graffiti artists caught working outside of these designated areas still face fines up to $6,000 TWD under a department of environmental protection regulation. However, Taiwanese authorities can be relatively lenient, one veteran police officer stating anonymously, \"Unless someone complains about vandalism, we won't get involved. We don't go after it proactively.\"\n\nIn 1993, after several expensive cars in Singapore were spray-painted, the police arrested a student from the Singapore American School, Michael P. Fay, questioned him, and subsequently charged him with vandalism. Fay pleaded guilty to vandalizing a car in addition to stealing road signs. Under the 1966 Vandalism Act of Singapore, originally passed to curb the spread of communist graffiti in Singapore, the court sentenced him to four months in jail, a fine of S$3,500 (US$2,233), and a caning. \"The New York Times\" ran several editorials and op-eds that condemned the punishment and called on the American public to flood the Singaporean embassy with protests. Although the Singapore government received many calls for clemency, Fay's caning took place in Singapore on 5 May 1994. Fay had originally received a sentence of six strokes of the cane, but the presiding president of Singapore, Ong Teng Cheong, agreed to reduce his caning sentence to four lashes.\n\nIn South Korea, Park Jung-soo was fined 2 million South Korean won by the Seoul Central District Court for spray-painting a rat on posters of the G-20 Summit a few days before the event in November 2011. Park alleged that the initial in \"G-20\" sounds like the Korean word for \"rat\", but Korean government prosecutors alleged that Mr. Park was making a derogatory statement about the president of ROK, Lee Myung-bak, the host of the summit. This case led to public outcry and debate on the lack of government tolerance and in support of freedom of expression. The court ruled that the painting, \"an ominous creature like a rat\" amounts to \"an organized criminal activity\" and upheld the fine while denying the prosecution's request for imprisonment for Park.\n\nIn Europe, community cleaning squads have responded to graffiti, in some cases with reckless abandon, as when in 1992 in France a local Scout group, attempting to remove modern graffiti, damaged two prehistoric paintings of bison in the Cave of Mayrière supérieure near the French village of Bruniquel in Tarn-et-Garonne, earning them the 1992 Ig Nobel Prize in archeology.\n\nIn September 2006, the European Parliament directed the European Commission to create urban environment policies to prevent and eliminate dirt, litter, graffiti, animal excrement, and excessive noise from domestic and vehicular music systems in European cities, along with other concerns over urban life.\n\nThe Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003 became Britain's latest anti-graffiti legislation. In August 2004, the Keep Britain Tidy campaign issued a press release calling for zero tolerance of graffiti and supporting proposals such as issuing \"on the spot\" fines to graffiti offenders and banning the sale of aerosol paint to anyone under the age of 16. The press release also condemned the use of graffiti images in advertising and in music videos, arguing that real-world experience of graffiti stood far removed from its often-portrayed 'cool' or 'edgy' image.\n\nTo back the campaign, 123 MPs (including then Prime Minister Tony Blair), signed a charter which stated: \"Graffiti is not art, it's crime. On behalf of my constituents, I will do all I can to rid our community of this problem.\" However, since the early 1990s, the British graffiti scene has been struck by self-titled \"art terrorist\" Banksy, who has revolutionized the style of UK graffiti (bringing to the forefront stencils to aid the speed of painting), as well as the content; making his work largely satirical of the sociological state of cities, or the political climate of war, often using monkeys and rats as motifs.\n\nIn the UK, city councils have the power to take action against the owner of any property that has been defaced under the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 (as amended by the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005) or, in certain cases, the Highways Act. This is often used against owners of property that are complacent in allowing protective boards to be defaced so long as the property is not damaged.\n\nIn July 2008, a conspiracy charge was used to convict graffiti artists for the first time. After a three-month police surveillance operation, nine members of the DPM crew were convicted of conspiracy to commit criminal damage costing at least £1 million. Five of them received prison sentences, ranging from eighteen months to two years. The unprecedented scale of the investigation and the severity of the sentences rekindled public debate over whether graffiti should be considered art or crime.\n\nSome councils, like those of Stroud and Loerrach, provide approved areas in the town where graffiti artists can showcase their talents, including underpasses, car parks, and walls that might otherwise prove a target for the 'spray and run.'\n\nIn Budapest, Hungary both a city-backed movement called \"I Love Budapest\" and a special police division tackle the problem, including the provision of approved areas.\n\nIn an effort to reduce vandalism, many cities in Australia have designated walls or areas exclusively for use by graffiti artists. One early example is the \"Graffiti Tunnel\" located at the Camperdown Campus of the University of Sydney, which is available for use by any student at the university to tag, advertise, poster, and create \"art\". Advocates of this idea suggest that this discourages petty vandalism yet encourages artists to take their time and produce great art, without worry of being caught or arrested for vandalism or trespassing. Others disagree with this approach, arguing that the presence of legal graffiti walls does not demonstrably reduce illegal graffiti elsewhere. Some local government areas throughout Australia have introduced \"anti-graffiti squads\", who clean graffiti in the area, and such crews as BCW (Buffers Can't Win) have taken steps to keep one step ahead of local graffiti cleaners.\n\nMany state governments have banned the sale or possession of spray paint to those under the age of 18 (age of majority). However, a number of local governments in Victoria have taken steps to recognize the cultural heritage value of some examples of graffiti, such as prominent political graffiti. Tough new graffiti laws have been introduced in Australia with fines of up to A$26,000 and two years in prison.\n\nMelbourne is a prominent graffiti city of Australia with many of its lanes being tourist attractions, such as Hosier Lane in particular, a popular destination for photographers, wedding photography, and backdrops for corporate print advertising. The Lonely Planet travel guide cites Melbourne's street as a major attraction. All forms of graffiti, including sticker art, poster, stencil art, and wheatpasting, can be found in many places throughout the city. Prominent street art precincts include; Fitzroy, Collingwood, Northcote, Brunswick, St. Kilda, and the CBD, where stencil and sticker art is prominent. As one moves farther away from the city, mostly along suburban train lines, graffiti tags become more prominent. Many international artists such as Banksy have left their work in Melbourne and in early 2008 a perspex screen was installed to prevent a Banksy stencil art piece from being destroyed, it has survived since 2003 through the respect of local street artists avoiding posting over it, although it has recently had paint tipped over it.\n\nIn February 2008 Helen Clark, the New Zealand prime minister at that time, announced a government crackdown on tagging and other forms of graffiti vandalism, describing it as a destructive crime representing an invasion of public and private property. New legislation subsequently adopted included a ban on the sale of paint spray cans to persons under 18 and increases in maximum fines for the offence from NZ$200 to NZ$2,000 or extended community service. The issue of tagging become a widely debated one following an incident in Auckland during January 2008 in which a middle-aged property owner stabbed one of two teenage taggers to death and was subsequently convicted of manslaughter.\n\nGraffiti databases have increased in the past decade because they allow vandalism incidents to be fully documented against an offender and help the police and prosecution charge and prosecute offenders for multiple counts of vandalism. They also provide law enforcement the ability to rapidly search for an offender's moniker or tag in a simple, effective, and comprehensive way. These systems can also help track costs of damage to city to help allocate an anti-graffiti budget. The theory is that when an offender is caught putting up graffiti, they are not just charged with one count of vandalism; they can be held accountable for all of the other damage for which they are responsible. This has two main benefits for law enforcement. One, it sends a signal to the offenders that their vandalism is being tracked. Two, a city can seek restitution from offenders for all of the damage that they have committed, not merely a single incident. These systems give law enforcement personnel real-time, street-level intelligence that allows them to not only focus on the worst graffiti offenders and their damage, but also to monitor potential gang violence that is associated with the graffiti.\n\nMany restrictions of civil gang injunctions are designed to help address and protect the physical environment and limit graffiti. Provisions of gang injunctions include things such as restricting the possession of marker pens, spray paint cans, or other sharp objects capable of defacing private or public property; spray painting, or marking with marker pens, scratching, applying stickers, or otherwise applying graffiti on any public or private property, including, but not limited to the street, alley, residences, block walls, and fences, vehicles and/or any other real or personal property. Some injunctions contain wording that restricts damaging or vandalizing the property of another, both public and private property, including, but limited to any vehicle, light fixture, door, fence, wall, gate, window, building, street sign, utility box, telephone box, trees, or power pole.\n\nTo help address many of these issues, many local jurisdictions have set up graffiti abatement hotlines, where citizens can call in and report vandalism and have it removed. San Diego's hotline receives more than 5,000 calls per year, in addition to reporting the graffiti, callers can learn more about prevention. One of the complaints about these hotlines is the response time; there is often a lag time between a property owner calling about the graffiti and its removal. The length of delay should be a consideration for any jurisdiction planning on operating a hotline. Local jurisdictions must convince the callers that their complaint of vandalism will be a priority and cleaned off right away. If the jurisdiction does not have the resources to respond to complaints in a timely manner, the value of the hotline diminishes. Crews must be able to respond to individual service calls made to the graffiti hotline as well as focus on cleanup near schools, parks, and major intersections and transit routes to have the biggest impact. Some cities offer a reward for information leading to the arrest and prosecution of suspects for tagging or graffiti related vandalism. The amount of the reward is based on the information provided, and the action taken.\n\nWhen the police use search warrants in connection with a vandalism investigation they are often seeking judicial approval to look for items such as cans of spray paint and nozzles from other kinds of aerosol sprays, etching tools, or other sharp or pointed objects used to etch or scratch glass and other hard surfaces, such as permanent marking pens and markers or paint sticks; evidence of membership or affiliation with any gang or tagging crew, paraphernalia to include any reference to \"(tagger's name),\" and any drawings, writings, objects, or graffiti depicting taggers' names, initials, logos, monikers, slogans, or mention of tagging crew membership; any newspaper clippings relating details of or referring to any graffiti crime.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "16827849", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16827849", "title": "Icelandic national costume", "text": "Icelandic national costume\n\nIcelandic national costume, collectively known in Icelandic as Þjóðbúningurinn has enjoyed various levels of popularity since the term was coined in Iceland in the 19th century, during the fight for independence. Since 2001 the national costume is regulated by \"Þjóðbúningaráð\" (The National Costume Authority), which preserves the correct techniques of making them and instructs people.\n\nThe five following types of costume are all recognized as Icelandic National costumes. However both the \"kyrtill\" and \"skautbúningur\" were designed in the 19th century from scratch as ceremonial costumes, while the \"faldbúningur\", \"peysuföt\" and the \"upphlutur\" are traditional daily wear of Icelandic women in olden times.\n\nThe \"Faldbúningur\" is an older type of costume worn by women since at least the 17th century and well into the 19th. In its most recognized form it incorporated a hat decorated with a curved sheet-like ornament protruding into the air and exists in two variants. One of which is the \"krókfaldur\" and the other is the \"spaðafaldur\". Previously a large hat decorated with gold-wire bands was worn with it, as well as ruff which is the reason for the \"faldbúningur\"'s wide collar, which was designed to support it. Later, around the start of the 18th century women started to wear the much simpler tail-cap with it.\n\nThe \"Peysuföt\" are black woollen clothes commonly worn by women in the 18-19th century. They usually consisted of a twill skirt and a jacket of fine knitted woollen yearn with a black tail cap. It is believed that this costume was invented when women, desiring simpler working clothes than the \"faldbúningur\", started to use male articles of clothing. This includes both the tail-cap and the \"peysa\" which originally was a jacket with a single row of buttons, but evolved into this costume and eventually discarded with the buttons.\n\nThe \"Upphlutur\" is a woman's costume, consisting of bodice that can be coloured in bright colours such as red or blue, but often black. Its headpiece is a tail cap. The costume is basically the undergarment of the \"faldbúningur\" which evolved into a costume of its own right.\n\nThe \"Kyrtill\" is a costume for women, designed by the artist Sigurður Guðmundsson in the 19th century. It was designed to look like Viking age costumes. It however incorporates a hat similar to the one on the \"skautbúningur\". While Sigurður's vision of the Viking age costume remains popular, costumes designed to more closely resemble archaeological finds have gained some popularity as well.\n\nThe \"Skautbúningur\" was also designed by Sigurður Guðmundsson. It was conceived as a modernized variation of the \"faldbúningur\", which had fallen out of use by the middle of the 19th century. It incorporates a complicated hat inspired by the ones traditionally used with the \"faldbúningur\".\n\n\"Búningur karla\" or the Men's costume exists in three or four radically different versions. The \"þjóðbúningur karla\" is the only direct descendant of traditional daily wear of Icelandic men, while the other were designed from the start as ceremonial costume.\n\nThe one considered most traditional consists of woollen breeches or trousers, a usually double buttoned vest and a double buttoned jacket called \"treyja\". Sometimes a \"peysa\" with a single row of buttons is used in lieu of the vest and \"treyja\". On the head is a tail cap, though historically different hats were also used. This costume was usually black, navy blue or dark green, although the vest, which was usually brighter was sometimes red, some regions stood out, using white wool instead of the darker colors. It is identical to the clothing Icelandic men commonly wore from the 17th until the 19th century.\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century, when many Icelandic men had taken to using continental clothing, Sigurður Guðmundsson, an Icelandic artist, designed a costume for men which closely resembles 10th century Nordic clothing. While it attained some popularity at the time, it eventually disappeared until at the end of the 20th century when Viking culture and traditions have enjoyed increased popularity.\n\nAlthough not a traditional costume, the \"hátíðarbúningur\" was conceived as a modernized version of the men's traditional national costume and is frequently worn instead of a tuxedo to formal events. It is the result of a competition for an updated (i.e., more pragmatic) version of the men's national costume held in 1994 in correlation with the 50th anniversary of Iceland's independence from Denmark and the establishment of the republic. Some have critiqued the design of the \"hátíðarbúningur\", claiming that it bears greater resemblance to the Faroese national costume in its styling. Regardless, the \"hátíðarbúningur\" continues to enjoy widespread popularity among Icelanders.\n\nSigurður Guðmundsson also designed another costume in the middle of the 19th century, which was commonly worn by students. It consisted of a black jacket, white shirt and black knee-breeches with horizontally striped or solid colored white socks.\n\nThe \"búningur barna\" or the children's costumes did not differ from the adult's version (except in size) until the 20th century, when girls were given shorter skirts.\n\nAlthough today, modern shoes are often used with the National Costumes, traditionally shoes made of either fish or sheep-skin, with woollen inlets, were worn with the costumes. These shoes are known as \"roðskór\" and \"sauðskinsskór\" respectively. Some people also use 18th or 19th century type leather shoes with buckles similar to the footwear commonly used with the Faroese and Norwegian National Costumes.\n\n<br>\nIn olden times these clothes, except the \"skautbúningur\", \"kyrtill\" and \"hátíðarbúningur\", were worn daily by people of all ages and classes. Today they are worn by many on ceremonial occasions such as the National day, Birthdays and Weddings.\n\n\n"}

The term is defined in a general way to refer to postsecondary students who are 25 years old and older. Nontraditional students are contrasted with traditional students, who enroll immediately after high school, are typically aged 18–22, attend full-time, live on campus, and do not have major work or family responsibilities. The NCES categorized anyone who satisfies at least one of the following as a nontraditional student:\n\n\nBy this definition, the NCES determined that 73% of all undergraduates in 1999–2000 could be considered nontraditional, representing the newly \"typical\" undergraduate. This remained consistent the following years: 72% in 2003–2004, 72% for 2007–2008, and 74% for 2011–2012.\n\nThe nontraditional student designation is also used in a specialized way to refer to socially or educationally disadvantaged students.\n\nIt is uncertain exactly how or when the term “nontraditional student” was first incorporated into educational language. However, it is thought that K. Patricia Cross is responsible for the phrase becoming the accepted and appropriate term to describe adult students.\n\nThe typical college student is not an 18-year-old, full-time student who enrolls immediately after high school, lives on-campus and who has limited family, work, and financial obligations.\n\nRegarding the 2011-2012 demographics distribution of nontraditional undergraduate students in the United States, the following were identified by the National Center for Education Statistics:\n\nIn 1999–2000, the most common nontraditional characteristics included financial independence (51 percent), part-time attendance (48 percent), and delayed enrollment (46 percent).\n\nThe NCES divides tertiary educational institutions into three categories: public, private-non-profit, and private-for-profit (PFP). With regard to the age demographic of students enrolled in these institutions, the NCES uses three age categories: under 25, between 25 and 34, and 35 and older. According to its most recent publication, in a section called \"The Condition of Education 2013,\"\"most nontraditional students are enrolled in PFP’s. In fact, for the fall enrollment in 2011, in four-year PFP institutions 71% full-time and 78% part-time students were at least 25 years old or older. In two-year PFP institutions, 52% full-time and 61% part-time students were also included in this 'nontraditional' category.\"\n\nNontraditional students frequently have different characteristics than traditional students, experience different barriers, and have different instructional and campus support needs than traditional students.\n\nWhile many institutions offer programs for nontraditional students and services in response to their specific needs, it is frequently observed that traditional higher education programs and policies are geared toward, and the outcome of, the previous era when traditional students were the main market for higher education.

It dealt with the Marvel heroes' decision to send the Hulk away, his acclimation to and conquest of the planet where he landed, and his efforts to return to Earth to take his revenge.\n\nThere was also a special \"Planet Hulk: Gladiator Guidebook\" publication by Anthony Flamini and the storyline's main writer Greg Pak, similar to the \"Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe\" detailing the characters, races and cultures within the storyline.\n\nElements from the storyline have been adapted into other media, including an animated film of the same name, as well as the live action film \"\".\n\nThe storyline's main writer Greg Pak describes the origin of the ideas: \"The inspiration for sending Hulk to an alien planet where he'd battle monsters as a gladiator came from Marvel Editor-in-Chief Joe Quesada. I loved the idea from the minute I heard it, so I was blown away when they told me I had the gig and even more blown away when they basically cut me loose to create the whole world.\" He also drew from real-world history: \"I got inspiration for the story by reading about the real lives of gladiators in ancient Rome and from the stories of figures like Genghis Khan and more contemporary warlords, dictators, and political leaders. Sun Tzu's \"Art of War\" and Joseph Campbell's \"Power of Myth\" played a big role in helping me think through other aspects of the story.\n\nThe story's roots began in the \"New Avengers: Illuminati\" one-shot and \"Incredible Hulk\" #88-91. The main storyline was told in \"Incredible Hulk\" #92-105, and \"Giant-Size Hulk\" vol 2 #1.\n\nIt led directly to the \"World War Hulk\" crossover, and inspired the \"Son of Hulk\" series.\n\nThe story was re-examined in \"What If?: Planet Hulk\".\n\nIn October of 2017, a sequel, titled \"Return to the Planet Hulk\", starring Amadeus Cho as the Hulk, was released as a part of Marvel's \"Marvel Legacy\" initiative.\n\nWhen a Gamma bomb causes the Hulk to lose control and attack Las Vegas, the Illuminati decide the Hulk is too dangerous to remain on Earth. They trick him into entering orbit to destroy a rogue satellite, and then use a shuttle to jettison him from the solar system. They intended for him to land on a peaceful planet, but the shuttle passes through a wormhole on its way.\n\nAs Hulk listens to a recording from the Illuminati explaining their actions, his shuttle crashes on the planet Sakaar. Weakened from the crash, Hulk is fixed with an obedience disk and taken into slavery. He is forced to fight gladiator battles for the planet's emperor, the Red King. Hulk forms a warbound pact with his fellow gladiators Miek, no-name Brood, Elloe Kaifi, Lavin Skee, Hiroim and Korg.\n\nHulk becomes a popular hero for his actions in the arena, and a group of insurgents try to recruit the Hulk to their cause. The Hulk declines, but Elloe chooses to go with the rebels.\n\nDuring their next gladiator fight, Lavin Skee is killed. As the others come closer to winning their freedom, the Red King's lieutenant, Caiera, arranges for them to fight the Silver Surfer, who is also controlled by an obedience disk. During the battle, the Hulk breaks the Silver Surfer's disk, freeing him. The Silver Surfer then destroys all the obedience disks of everyone in the arena. As he leaves Sakaar, he offers to return Hulk to Earth. Hulk chooses to stay behind.\n\nThe Hulk and his warbound, now on the run from the Red King, are hunted by Caiera. As they travel through villages, Hulk finds followers who believe he is the foretold savior, \"Sakaarson.\" Hulk denies this title. Caiera finally confronts the Hulk, but their battle is interrupted by an invasion of \"spikes\" that cause monstrous mutations and death to anyone they touch. Caiera calls the Red King for assistance and learns that he ordered the spikes to be deployed there. Horrified at what her king has done, Caiera joins the Hulk.\n\nHulk leads a raid on the Red King's capital, culminating in a one-on-one battle between the two of them. The Red King is defeated, and Hulk is named the new king. He takes Caiera for his wife, and the two are able to broker peace among the various conflicts which had festered under the Red King. Caiera becomes pregnant with Hulk's child.\n\nMeanwhile, the shuttle that brought Hulk to Sakaar is being turned into a monument. As part of its self-destruct sequence, the antimatter warp core engine detonates in a massive explosion. The whole city is destroyed, and Caiera dies. Enraged and blaming the Avengers who built the shuttle for the damage, Hulk and his warbound leave Sakaar and head for Earth.\n\nArriving on Earth, Hulk and the warbound begin World War Hulk.\n\nSakaar rebuilds after the explosion with the help of Hulk's two surviving sons, Skaar and Hiro-Kala.\n\nThe series has been collected into a number of individual volumes:\n\n\nA special issue of \"What If?\" featured three alternate versions of Planet Hulk:\n\nThe 2015 \"Secret Wars\" crossover included a miniseries titled \"Planet Hulk\" written by Sam Humphries and penciled by Marc Laming. It follows a variation of Steve Rogers and a variation of Devil Dinosaur as they fight their way through the Battleworld domain of Greenland, a region filled with an assortment of Hulks.\n\nIn an alternate Marvel Universe, Dr. Bruce Banner (who has no alter ego) owns a large technology business known as Bannertech. The headquarters is a city of the future where Amadeus Cho (who works at Bannertech), performs unauthorized gamma experiments on animals. Dr. Banner and Amadeus are alerted by S.H.I.E.L.D. that the Gamma Bomb in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s possession has been stolen and launched by A.I.M. Bruce attempts to evacuate the city of the future whilst Amadeus tries to hijack the bomb. The bomb ultimately crashes into the Bannertech tower, destroying it and catching evacuating employees in its blast radius. Dr. Banner and his employees are turned green, but they are relieved that they are alive. Amadeus is not seen again. The employees and Dr. Banner suddenly mutate into various Hulk creatures. When the various Marvel universes collide, a section of this Earth including the inhabiting Hulks become the region of Battleworld known as Greenland. Sometime after the creation of Battleworld, Doctor Doom has his Thor Corps perform a mission for him. As they fly over the Mud Kingdom in Greenland, they are attacked by the Hulks who live there. The Hulks' primitive weapons anger the Thor Corps who stop the attack by destroying the Hulks' homes. The Thor Corps then leave as they were told to contain battles, but not to interfere. Meanwhile, in God Emperor Doom's Killiseum in Doomstadt, Steve Rogers and Devil Dinosaur win their twelfth fight. Whilst being congratulated by Arcade, they attempt to interrogate him to find where Bucky Barnes currently is. Their attempt fails and Steve is summoned by God Emperor Doom. Sheriff Strange offers Steve a chance to live on behalf of God Emperor Doom. Steve must travel to Greenland, kill the Red King, and rescue Bucky from him. Steve takes Devil Dinosaur with him and they are teleported by Doctor Strange to Greenland. Upon arrival, they are meant to meet with an operative. However, they are attacked by gamma-irradiated bugs. Steve and Devil Dinosaur are saved by a Hulk named Doc Green who fires a powerful laser cannon killing the bugs.\n\nUpon getting acquainted with the Captain and the Devil after they woke up, Doc Green agrees to become their guide in Greenland to help them navigate it and rescue Bucky from the Red King. During a flashback in an unknown kingdom, the Captain and Bucky are racing through the rubble in the streets of a war-torn city. A missile blows up the ground in front of Bucky. Steve digs Bucky out of the rubble. Steve picks up Bucky and starts to carry him to safety. Bucky says that they need to get underground. Bucky then suggests that he and Steve enlist to fight. Steve comments that they are both beanpoles and have no business fighting. Bucky points to a picture of The Falcon as Captain America in a propaganda poster for the Super Soldier program. Steve says it is nothing but a pipe dream. On their way to the Mud Kingdom, Doc Green saves the Captain and Devil from a Hulk-Eating Plant. The Captain and Doc Green were then attacked by Bull Hulks and separated from Devil. Upon ending up in the Gamma Lake after escaping into the river and going over the waterfall, the Captain and Doc Green were attacked by a giant aquatic creature called a Sea Hulk that grabs the Captain with its tentacle. Doc Green then quotes \"There you are. Come out and play.\"\n\nAs Doc Green tried to get to the Captain, the Devil showed up and attacked the Sea Hulk, killing it by biting off part of its neck during the fight. The incident put them off course, leaving them with two choices: circle back around the Fang Mountains which would take three days or cut straight to the Mud Kingdom by going through the Barrens of the Tribal Hulks where the Tribal Hulks dwell. The Captain decided to go through the Barrens of the Tribal Hulk as it was the faster route. In their way through the Barrens, they saw a wall made of the skulls of the people who died in the civil war between the Mud Kingdom and the Tribal Hulks. Doc Green said that the gamma only revealed what's already within each living being: an obsession with war and violence. It was the reality everyone denied. He then began to mock the Captain by saying it would be no different with him if he got corrupted by gamma as he was already doing God Emperor Doom's dirty work. But Captain said he wouldn't as he planned to find and free Bucky without killing the Red King. As a storm approached them, they took shelter inside a cave and were attacked and captured by the Tribal Hulks.\n\nThe Captain was taken by the Tribal Hulks to the Mud Kingdom to be sold as an slave, but was rescued by Doc Green before the Tribal Hulks could do so. After they got to the top of a structure, Doc Green pointed at the Red King's castle where Bucky was being held. Doc Green warned the Captain that it was not like the time when he and Bucky stole pies from grandma Hubbard. Surprised, the Captain asked him how he did know about that and who he was before he turned into a Hulk. Before Doc Green could answer, the Devil returned to help the Captain. With his help, the Captain invaded the castle and confronted the Red King. The Captain told him about his mission, but said that if he resealed Bucky, he would them spare his life. The Red King revealed that God Emperor Doom had lied to him and that he had sent Bucky's head to Doomsgard a month ago. He then grabbed the severed bionic arm of Bucky and said that Bucky wasn't his prisoner, but his trophy.\n\nThe Red King then tried to convince Rogers to join his army to take God Emperor Doom down, as he was the one responsible for Bucky's death, however, he was attacked and killed by Rogers instead. Doc Green showed up afterwards, congratulating the Captain for the completion of his mission. With the Red King dead, Doc Green would take his place and rule the Mud Kingdom as God Emperor Doom had planned. The Captain started to argue with him as he knew that Bucky was already dead and manipulated him into thinking otherwise in order to get the mission done, while Doc Green mocked him by having succumbed to the Hulk inside himself just like him. Rogers said he wasn't anything like Doc Green. In order to prove him wrong, Doc Green returns to his human form of a Steve Rogers from a domain similar to the one the Captain came from where his Bucky died and he became a Hulk. Doc Green taunted a confused Captain about how Bucky made him weak and because of his loyalty to him he would leave him to rule the Greenland. The Captain responded that Bucky had made him brave enough to do what must be done and killed Doc Green. The Captain then threw the severed head of the Red King in front of the Tribal Hulks which ended the battle between them and Devil. After grieving their companion's death, the Captain and the Devil left the Mud Kingdom behind.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Coalition governments are predominant on both the federal and the state level exemplifying the German desire for consensus politics instead of one party majority rule as in democracies that follow the Westminster model. Although this consensus culture is beneficial insofar as it enables minority groups to take part in political discussions and decision making, it often leads to situations in which different interest groups blockade each other resulting in political gridlocks. Political decision making is further complicated by the powers held by the German states and the presence of a judicial branch with the power to review and dismiss legislation. Therefore political power in Germany is not concentrated in the hands of one or a small number of individuals but spread thinly. Even the Chancellor can only set general guidelines for federal policies (Richtlinienkompetenz) and has to negotiate with many other politicians and interest groups when there is a need to take concrete measures.\n"}

The name \"pork-knockers\" refers to their regular diet of pickled pork of wild pig that is often eaten at the end of the day. Caribbean author A. R. F. Webber suggested that the term may have originated as \"pork-barrel knocker\".\n\nA 1921 account observed that most pork-knockers of that era were of African descent and worked individually or in small groups. Pork-knockers have often been dependent on bush traders, who carry mining supplies and sometimes grubstake the pork-knockers' operations. Pork-knockers may work in close proximity to each other and disputed claims may lead to violence.\n\nPork-knockers have been responsible for discovering large deposits of gold and diamonds. Many Guyanese stories describe pork-knockers who have made fortunes only to lose them in a tragic or comic fashion. Guyana-born author Jan Carew's 1958 novel \"Black Midas\" involves a boy leaving his coastal village to become a pork-knocker.\n\nThe presence of pork-knockers in the Guyanese interior has upset traditional Amerindian life there. The Akawaio people have experienced land disputes with pork-knockers and have been adversely affected by a rising cost of living. Amazonian anthropologist Audrey Butt Colson observed that mining has led to a collapse of the subsistence economy. Butt Colson writes that mining village Kamarang, known as \"Red Light City\", typifies the \"pork-knocker syndrome of drink, gambling, sex, conspicuous consumption and, from time to time, violence.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11630765", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11630765", "title": "Pure alexia", "text": "Pure alexia\n\nPure alexia, also known as agnosic alexia or alexia without agraphia or pure word blindness, is one form of alexia which makes up \"the peripheral dyslexia\" group. Individuals who have pure alexia have severe reading problems while other language-related skills such as naming, oral repetition, auditory comprehension or writing are typically intact.\n\nPure alexia is also known as: \"alexia without agraphia\", \"letter-by-letter dyslexia\", \"spelling dyslexia\", or \"word-form dyslexia\". Another name for it is \"Dejerine syndrome\", after Joseph Jules Dejerine, who described it in 1892; however, when using this name, it should not be confused with medial medullary syndrome which shares the same eponym.\n\nPure alexia results from cerebral lesions in circumscribed brain regions and therefore belongs to the group of acquired reading disorders, alexia, as opposed to developmental dyslexia found in children who have difficulties in learning to read.\n\nPure alexia almost always involves an infarct to the left posterior cerebral artery (which perfuses the splenium of the corpus callosum and left visual cortex, among other things). The resulting deficit will be pure alexia – i.e., the patient can write but cannot read (even what they have just written). However, because pure alexia affects visual input, not auditory input, patients with pure alexia can recognize words that are spelled out loud to them. This is because the left visual cortex has been damaged, leaving only the right visual cortex (occipital lobe) able to process visual information, but it is unable to send this information to the language areas (Broca's area, Wernicke's area, etc.) in the left brain because of the damage to the splenium of the corpus callosum. Patients with this deficit mostly do have a stroke to the posterior cerebral artery. But they may be susceptible to pure alexia as a consequence of other traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) as well. Anything that stops proper blood flow to the area necessary for normal reading abilities will cause a form of alexia. The posterior cerebral artery is a main local for the cause of this deficit because this artery is not just responsible for itself. It also supplies the anterior temporal branches, the posterior temporal branches, the calcarrine branch, and the parieto-occipital branch. What is important about these arteries is their location. All of them supply blood to the back outer parts of the brain. This part of the brain is also referred to as the posterior lateral part of the brain. In cases of pure alexia, locations are found in the section of the brain, specifically the temporo-occipital area. This is the area that is activated when people without any sort of alexia receive activation when undergoing orthographic processing. This area is known as the visual word form area due to this pattern of activation.\n\nStudies have shown that pure alexia may be a result of a disconnection syndrome. Analysis of diffusion images showed that the visual word form area (VWFA) is connected to the occipital lobe via the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), a projection that runs between the temporal and occipital lobe. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) showed that two weeks after surgery in the ILF, the VWFA-Occipital Lobe tract was severely degenerated. The results came from an epileptic patient who showed symptoms of pure alexia after his surgery. Thus, the proposed pathophysiological mechanism is that the ILF lesion interferes with transmission of visual information to the VWFA. There is, however, an alternative view that suggests the \"VWFA\" is devoted to processing of high acuity foveal input, which is particularly salient for complex visual stimuli like letter strings. Studies have highlighted disrupted processing of non-linguistic visual stimuli after damage to the left pFG, both for familiar and unfamiliar objects \n\nPure alexia exhibits some unexpected residual abilities despite the inability to read words. For instance, one patient had preserved calculation capabilities such as deciding which number was greater, and whether a number was odd or even with greater than chance probability. The study showed that the patient was also able to calculate simple arithmetic tasks such as addition, subtraction, and division, but not multiplication, even though the patient could not read the numbers. For example, the patient would be presented with \"8 – 6\", and he or she would read it as \"five minus four\", but still come up with the correct answer \"two\" with greater than chance accuracy. Pure alexia patients also seem to retain some residual semantic processing. They are able to perform better than chance when forced to make a lexical decision or make a semantic-categorisation decision. These subjects also performed better with nouns than functors, better with words that had high rather than low imageability, and performed poorly with suffixes. However, this may be due to right hemisphere input or residual left hemisphere input.\n\nIn patients, a common symptom is letter-by-letter reading or LBL. This action is a compensatory strategy which these patients use in order to come up with a semblance of reading. It is essentially looking at the consonants and vowels of the word and sounding them out as they sound. However, this method does not always work, especially for words like 'phone' where the ph sounds like an f, but if sounded out, does not sound like an f. Also, by reading words in the fashion, the rate at which patients read words is much slower compared to people who do not have this disability. Petersen et al. proved that the issue of reading time had more to do with the length of the words than reading ability. The team had 4 patients with right hemisphere damage and 4 patients with left hemisphere damage in the temporo-occipital lobes as well as 26 controls were shown one word at a time on a screen. They were exposed to 20 words of 3 and 5 letters, 12 words of 7 letters. The subjects were asked to read the words as quickly and as accurately as possible. The patients with left hemisphere lesions consistently read the longer words slower than the controls despite the difficulty of the word. It is thought that as the word gets longer, the letters on the outsides of the word go into peripheral vision, making the patient shift their attention thus making the patient take longer to read.\n\nThough there have been ample attempts to rehabilitate patients with pure alexia, few have proven to be effective on a large scale. Most rehabilitation practices have been specialized to a single patient or small patient group. At the simplest level, patients seeking rehabilitation are asked to practice reading words aloud repeatedly. This is meant to stimulate the damaged system of the brain. This is known as multiple oral re-reading (MOR) treatment. This is a text-based approach that is implemented in order to prevent patients from LBL reading. MOR works by reading aloud the same text repeatedly until certain criteria are reached. The most important criteria for a pure alexic patient is reading at an improved rate. The treatment aims to shift patients away from the LBL reading strategy by strengthening links between visual input and the associated orthographic representations. This repetition supports the idea of using top-down processing initially minimize the effects peripheral processing which were demonstrated in the study above. From here, the goal is to increase bottom-up processing. This will hopefully aid in word recognition and promote interactive processing of all available information to support reading. 'The supported reading stimulation from MOR has a rehabilitative effect so that reading rate and accuracy are better for untrained text, and word-form recognition improves as evidenced by a reduced word-length effect.' These tactics have seen quite good success. \nAnother tactic that has been employed is the use of cross modal therapy. In this therapy, patients are asked to trace the words in which they are trying to read aloud. There has been success using cross modal therapy such as kinaesthetic or motor-cross cuing therapy, but tends to be a more feasible approach for those on the slower reading end of the spectrum.\n"}

Like many genres of contemporary art, sound art may be interdisciplinary in nature, or be used in hybrid forms. Sound art can be considered as being an element of many areas such as acoustics, psychoacoustics, electronics, noise music, audio media, found or environmental sound, soundscapes, explorations of the human body, sculpture, architecture, film or video and other aspects of the current discourse of contemporary art.\n\nIn Western art, early examples include Luigi Russolo's \"Intonarumori\" or noise intoners, and subsequent experiments by Dadaists, Surrealists, the Situationist International, and in Fluxus happenings. Because of the diversity of sound art, there is often debate about whether sound art falls within the domains of visual art or experimental music categories, or both. Other artistic lineages from which sound art emerges are conceptual art, minimalism, site-specific art, sound poetry, electro-acoustic music, spoken word, avant-garde poetry, and experimental theatre.\n\nThe earliest documented use of the term in the U.S. is from a catalogue for a show called \"Sound/Art\" at The Sculpture Center in New York City, created by William Hellerman in 1983. The show was sponsored by \"The SoundArt Foundation,\" which Hellerman founded in 1982. The artists featured in the show were: Vito Acconci, Connie Beckley, Bill and Mary Buchen, Nicolas Collins, Sari Dienes and Pauline Oliveros, Richard Dunlap, Terry Fox, William Hellermann, Jim Hobart, Richard Lerman, Les Levine, Joe Lewis, Tom Marioni, Jim Pomeroy, Alan Scarritt, Carolee Schneeman, Bonnie Sherk, Keith Sonnier, Norman Tuck, Hannah Wilke, Yom Gagatzi. The following is an excerpt from the catalogue essay by art historian Don Goddard: \"It may be that sound art adheres to curator Hellermann's perception that \"hearing is another form of seeing,' that sound has meaning only when its connection with an image is understood... The conjunction of sound and image insists on the engagement of the viewer, forcing participation in real space and concrete, responsive thought rather than illusionary space and thought.\" Sound art always takes place in an acoustic context, which may influence interpretation as much as if not more than any associated imagery. Installations of sound art rely on the acoustics of the spaces and reproduction technologies employed as can be exemplified by current practitioners such as Chris Watson.\n\nThe Klankenbos (Sound forest) of Provinciaal Domein Dommelhof is the biggest sound art collection in public space in Europe. In the forest there are 15 sound installation pieces by artists such as Pierre Berthet, Paul Panhuysen, Geert Jan Hobbijn (Staalplaat Soundsystem), Hans van Koolwijk, and others. Yearly in Kortrijk there is the sound art festival Wilde Westen (formerly known as Happy New Ears). In Brussels there are QO2 and Overtoon, two organisations that run artist-in-residence programs and organize events. Logos Foundation from Ghent is a sound art org run by Godfried-Willem Raes.\n\nIn Zadar there is the Sea Organ which plays music by way of sea waves and tubes located underneath a set of large marble steps.\n\nOriginally from Amsterdam, but moved to Berlin is Staalplaat, a record label focused on sound art and experimental music. Transmediale is a yearly festival focused on media art, covering many sound art performances and installations.\n\nThe Dutch sound art tradition started more or less in the Philips Natuurkundig Laboratorium where Dick Raaijmakers worked in the 60s. Paul Panhuysen and Remko Scha developed many early sound art pieces in the 70s and 80s and set up the Apollohuis in Eindhoven. STEIM. WORM, Extrapool are active organisations that have sound art activities. Polderlicht was a sound art festival running from 2000–2015. iii (Instrument Inventors innitiative]] is a The Hague based organisation focused on the creation of sound art pieces. The organisation has an active artist-in-residence program and continuously invites sound artists to make new works at their location. The Netherlands have three academies where you can study in the direction of sound art Institute of Sonology, Art Science at Royal Academy of Art, The Hague and at the Utrecht School of the Arts in Utrecht.\n\nLydgalleriet (The Soundgallery) is a non-commercial gallery for sound based art practices, situated in the centre of Bergen.\n\nPlaying the Building was an art installation by David Byrne, ex singer of Talking Heads, and Färgfabriken, an independent art venue in Stockholm. Elektronmusikstudion is an active organisation.\n\nA known sound art pieces in the UK are Blackpool High Tide Organ and Singing Ringing Tree.

Most board games, card games, sports, or other games, can be adopted to create a stripping variant. A classic example is strip poker, the strip variant of poker.\n\nStrip games can be played by single-sex groups or by mixed groups and may be intended to generate an atmosphere of fun and lighten the social atmosphere, or to heighten the sexual atmosphere by creating sexual excitement. Like other adult or adolescent party games, activities besides removing clothing and playing cards might be involved. (\"Truth or Dare?\" type options are often included.)\n\nStrip games are comparable to drinking games, in which players are required to match game losses with the drinking of a certain amount of alcohol.\n\nIn a strip variant of a game, players, in addition to losing points according to the normal rules of the game, are also required to incrementally remove their clothing. The number of garments removed depends on the particular rules being used, but typically one piece is removed per loss or per point lost. As there are many variants of each game, the rules which will be followed on each occasion will need to be made clear, especially if there are new players. A rule which will need to be clear is when a game is to stop. For example, players can agree for the game to stop when a player is in their underwear, has only one article left or is naked or for the game to continue until only one player is left with some clothes on; and if any player can pull out if they feel uncomfortable. Other rules which will be made clear is when a player must remove clothing, as well as what constitutes \"clothing\" (for example, whether a pair of shoes or socks is one article or two, and whether jewelry, sunglasses or other accessories are clothing).\n\nGenerally, players will start wearing the same number of articles of clothing, though that is not necessary. It must be made clear as to what happens when a player has removed all their clothes. For example, the person may be permitted to put their clothes back on and continue playing, or the person may continue playing without clothes, until everybody has removed their clothing, or for the game to stop at that point, with the players either putting clothes back on, or remaining unclothed or semi-clothed for the rest of the evening.\n\nUnlike their traditional variants, strip games are usually not played until the last player is removed from the game by being outscored by other players, instead players are removed from the game when they have no further garments left to take off or refuse to take off further garments.\n\nThese variations of rules are introduced in order to make game play more enticing, get more players involved, and keep guests entertained, especially during parties where alcohol is already being consumed. Unlike its traditional counterpart, the strip game becomes significantly more exciting the longer it progresses, as players are anticipating the losers to be fully or partially nude, depending on the rules of the game.\n\nAs with drinking games, the strip game is usually not drawn out until the players are fully undressed or completely intoxicated, instead the players usually withdraw from the game voluntarily beforehand, depending on the degree of their personal inhibitions, as well as the general social atmosphere.\n\nThe rules of many card and board games can be altered to produce a strip variant. Traditional casino games, such as blackjack and poker, as well as games often played at parties, such as Scrabble, Bullshit, Speed, chess, Yahtzee, Shithead, and many others can be varied to include a stripping aspect.\n\nStrip poker is played like regular varieties of poker, except that players remove an article of clothing when they lose a round. Any form of poker can be adapted to a strip form; however, it is usually played with simple variants with few betting rounds, like five-card draw.\n\nBased on that most simple of card games \"snap\" where two players simultaneously place a card face up on the table. If the cards are the same they must shout \"snap\". The winner is the one who shouts \"snap\" correctly first. A player also wins if the other player incorrectly shouts snap. As with standard snap, the winner takes all cards on the table. But in this case the loser also removes an item of clothing. A player loses either when they have removed all their clothes or the other player accumulates all the cards, at which point the loser must remove the last of their clothes. \n\nInstead of shouting \"Snap\" the players can shout \"strip\" which some believe adds to the atmosphere. \n\nUsually played between couples as a form of foreplay. In groups, played between pairs with winners playing winners until only one person remains wearing clothes. In group sessions winners may re-dress between games, if that is agreed beforehand, to extend gameplay. Otherwise getting dressed is unusual, being regarded as missing the point of the game and being prudish. The final winner is expected to remove the last of their clothes upon declaration as winner. Only at that point may everybody dress, if that has been agreed before the game. Usually people remain naked or leave.\n\nThe gender mix in the group games and individual pairs is entirely a matter for the participants. In some games selecting pairs randomly from the group, or randomly within gender, such as by throwing dice, adds to the atmosphere and acts as an \"ice breaker\" which is the underlying purpose of the game.\n\nLike regular Blackjack, players try to get a higher card count than a dealer and not over 21. Each time a player wins a hand, the dealer takes off one article of clothing and if the dealer wins, the player/s take one off.\n\nNormal Scrabble rules apply except for the stripping rules, which can vary. For example, the players can agree to remove an article of clothing if a player scores less than 5 points; or when another player gets a triple word score; or if a player did not score the highest score on a round.\n\nThis game is a variant of pass the parcel or hot potato, and involves a group of people passing around a wind-up music box. When the music stops playing, the person holding the box must remove an item of clothing. The box is then wound up and passed around again.\n\nThe same as rock-paper-scissors game. The most popular strip game in Japan, possibly even in East Asia.\n\nStandard Twister gameplay, with the additional penalty that every time a player falls, they must remove an article of clothing.\n\nStandard Uno gameplay, Normal Uno rules apply except for the stripping rules, every time a player loses a hand, the person must remove an item of clothing.\n\nStripping games also often appear as plot devices or even themes in erotic or pornographic films. One example of such a case is the 2012 film \"Strip Mahjong: Battle Royale\".\n\nPartial or complete removal of clothing has formed a central role in numerous game shows broadcast in Europe, Asia and the US for some years. These include:\n\n"}
{"id": "654624", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=654624", "title": "Taiaha", "text": "Taiaha\n\nA taiaha () is a traditional weapon of the Māori of New Zealand; a close-quarters staff weapon made from either wood or whalebone, and used for short, sharp strikes or stabbing thrusts with efficient footwork on the part of the wielder.\n\nTaiaha are usually between in length. It has three main parts; the \"arero\" (tongue), used for stabbing the opponent and parrying; the \"upoko\" (head), the base from which the tongue protrudes; and the \"ate\" (liver) or \"tinana\" (body), the long flat blade which is also used for striking and parrying.\n\nMau rākau is the martial art that teaches the use of the taiaha and other Māori weapons in combat. As with other martial arts styles, students of the taiaha spend years mastering the skills of timing, balance and co-ordination necessary to wield the weapon effectively. The taiaha is widely known due to its use in the \"wero\" — the traditional Māori challenge during the pōwhiri, a formal welcoming ceremony. A \"wero\" is commonly given to heads of state and visiting dignitaries welcomed to New Zealand.\n\nThe taiaha is one of many cultural items which are used to introduce children in school to Māori culture. They are also used in present-day kapa haka competitions, and training with the taiaha is seen as part of the Māori cultural revival.\n\nThe use of traditional Māori weaponry declined after the Europeans arrived in New Zealand. Weapons like the taiaha were replaced by the European’s muskets and para whakawai, or traditional Māori weaponry training schools, disappeared altogether. As a result, the traditional weaponry knowledge was lost among many Maori tribes. Some tribes managed to maintain their distinctive traditions by passing down traditional knowledge secretly between a few chosen individuals.\n\nDuring the Māori cultural renaissance in the 1980s, there has been a renewed interest and cultivation of traditional weapons. Although there is a much narrower range of traditional weapons being revived, the Māori weaponry has expanded to become a significant trademark of Māori culture. This revival has been part of the larger Māori cultural renaissance that began in the late 1960s. The survival of Māori weaponry was only possible with the work and activism of remaining experts like Irirangi Tiakiawa, Pita Sharples, John Rangihau, Matiu Mareikura and Mita Mohi.\n\nIn a modern context, Māori weaponry is severely limited to just a few types, with the taiaha being one of the most popular. Likewise, only a small number of para whakawai are in operation—most are taught within a tribal framework. Much of the knowledge within today’s para whakawai is presented with a background of a deeper tribal history, offering a strong sense of identity, kinship and belonging.\n\nThe para whakawai on Mokoia Island in Lake Rotorua trains members of Te Arawa and other interested individuals in weaponry ideologies, theories and beliefs. This programme was established under the guidance of Mita Mohi in the mid-1980s. This programme was extended to the Christchurch area in the 90s being delivered by Temairiki Williams and the group Te Tohu O Tu. \n\nThe para whakawai Te Whare Tū Taua o Aotearoa began at Hoani Waititi marae in Auckland and grew to include a number of outreach programmes in different regions. It was established by Pita Sharples in the 1980s ‘to offer the ancient art of mau rakau back to Maoridom as an innovative programme’.\n\nWarfare and weaponry were essential to the traditionally militant Māori society. Children were prepared for warfare from an early age. Their early training included playing activities like boxing, wrestling and stick-throwing games.\n\nIn the para whakawai, the young men learned mau rākau (the use of weapons). They were instructed in battle formations, weapon use, and attack and defense maneuvers. They would often participate in mock battles using reeds instead of the real weapons. Rakanga waewae (skilful footwork) was vital to fighting and using weapons. Using weapons, especially the taiaha, takes \"a lot of maneuvering. It is dangerous. It requires hours, days, months and years of constant use to master it.\"\n\nTo Māori, weapons were more than just implements of warfare — they were taonga (treasures), and handed down as precious heirlooms from generation to generation. Weapons were made of wood, stone and bone in a slow, painstaking process. Traditionally, a long weapon from hardwood could take months to shape and decorate; a stone patu would take over a year to complete. Though it took time to fashion weapons, the level of dedication and pride in creating these objects made them valuable. Karakia (incantations) were sometimes said over weapons to imbue them with deities and make them tapu (sacred).\n\n\nOther Māori weapons:\n\n"}
{"id": "41046196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41046196", "title": "The Global Media Monitoring Project", "text": "The Global Media Monitoring Project\n\nThe Global Media Monitoring Project (GMMP) is the largest international study of gender in the news media. It is also an advocacy organization that aims to change the representation of women in the news media. Every five years since 1995 the GMMP collects data on indicators of gender in the news, such as: the presence of women, gender bias, and stereotyping. The most recent study, conducted in 2015, encompassed 114 countries.\n\nThe idea for a media monitoring project was created at the Women Empowering Communication international conference in Bangkok in 1994. The World Association for Christian Communication (WACC) along with MediaWatch (Canada) took up the project. They had several key goals:\n\nCoverage\n\nThe 1995 Report covered 71 countries, and was conducted by volunteers over the span of one day. Consequent studies took place in 2000 and covered 70 countries, in 2005 covering 76 countries, in 2010 in 108 countries and in 2015 in 114 countries. All of the monitoring and compiling of reports is carried out by volunteers. GMMP reports have been presented at the Women’s NGO Forum in Beijing (1995), the UN Beijing + 5 (2000), a parallel-session at the Commission on the Status of Women 2010 session, and in 100 Women BBC series 2015 \"Is News Failing Women?\".\n\nThe 2015 Project covered 22,136 news items, 26,010 news personnel, and 45,402 total news subjects in newspaper, radio, television, internet news and news media tweets. The research discussed news subjects, personnel and content through the framework of media accountability to women .\n\nNews Subjects\n\nThe report discovered that progress towards gender parity in the news has almost ground to a halt over the period 2010 to 2015: Women make up only 24% of the persons heard, read about or seen in newspaper, television and radio news, exactly as they did in 2010. Over the past two decades, the gender gap in people in the news has narrowed most dramatically in Latin America by 13 percent. Women are three percent less visible in political news stories now than five years ago. They comprise 38% of people interviewed on the basis of personal experience compared to 31% in 2005. North America has the highest percentage of women experts in the news (32%), followed by the Caribbean (29%) and Latin America (29%). In 2015, progress towards news representation that acknowledges women's participation in economic life remain elusive: While women in the real world hold at least 40% of paid employment globally, in the news world only 20% of the workers in the formal labor force are women, while 67% of the news world unemployed and stay-at-home parents are women. Portrayals of women as survivors of domestic violence have risen by more than four times across the period 2005 to 2015.\n\nReporters and Presenters\n\nThe 2015 GMMP detected what appears to be a global glass ceiling for female news reporters as far as they are visible in newspaper bylines and newscast reports. Women have consistently reported only 37% of the news over the past decade from 2005 to 2015. Women as news reporters are most present on radio, at 41%, and least in print news, at 35%. Younger presenters on screen are predominantly female, but the scales tip dramatically at 50 years old when men begin to dominate the news-anchoring scene. At 65 years and older, women disappear from the screen as reporters and presenters.\n\nNews Content\n\n9% of stories overall contain reference to legal, rights or policy frameworks, with social and legal stories making the highest contribution to the global average. A rights angle is barely present is political and economic stories. 97% of political stories in Asia, 98% of economic stories in the Pacific region and the Middle East perform poorly on the rights-focus yardstick. 14% of stories by female reporters focus centrally on women, in contrast to 9% of stories by their male counterparts. 9% of stories evoke gender equality or inequality issues, more than double the percentage documented in 2005. Only 4% of stories clearly challenge gender stereotypes, a one percent change since 2005.\n\nDigital News\n\nWomen's relative invisibility in traditional news media has crossed over into digital news delivery platforms: Only 26% of the people in internet news stories and media news tweets combined are women. Women report five percent more stories online than in the traditional mediums combined: 42% of online news are reported by women. Gender difference in source selection by female and male reporters becomes starker in online news: Women are 33% of sources in stories by online news female reporters, compared to 23% in stories by men. Only 4% of news media tweets clearly challenge gender stereotypes, exactly similar to the overall percentage of print, radio and television stories that challenge such stereotypes.\n\nThe GMMP 1995 - 2015 findings paint a picture in which unequal gender power relations are entrenched and validated, and in which gender stereotypes are replicated and reinforced by the world's news media.\n\nThat the patterns of underrepresentation, misrepresentation and invisibilization of women have continued into the digital news world show that the problem is deeply entrenched in the mainstream news media system irrespective of the platform through which news are channeled.\n"}
{"id": "2364632", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2364632", "title": "The Haywain Triptych", "text": "The Haywain Triptych\n\nThe Haywain Triptych is a panel painting by Hieronymus Bosch, currently housed in the Museo del Prado, Madrid, Spain. A date of around 1516 has been established by means of dendrochronological research. The central panel, signed \"Jheronimus Bosch\", measures 135 by 200 centimeters and the wings measure 147 × 66 cm. The outside shutters feature a version of Bosch's \"The Wayfarer\".\n\nThe painting was part of a group of six acquired by king Philip II of Spain in 1570, and shipped to El Escorial four years later. It was later sold to the Marquis of Salamanca, and divided into three paintings. In 1848, the central panel was bought by Isabella II of Spain and brought to Aranjuez, the right one was returned to Escorial and the left went to the Prado. The triptych was finally recomposed in 1914 in the latter museum. A copy exists at the Escorial.\n\nThe exterior of the shutters, like most contemporary Netherlandish triptychs, were also painted, although in this case Bosch used full colors instead of the usual grisaille. When closed, they form a single scene depicting a wayfarer. Around him is a series of miniatures including the robbery of another wayfarer and a hanged man. The man uses a stick to repel a dog.\n\nAccording to the most recent interpretations, this figure may represent the man who follows his road in spite of the temptation of sins (such as lust, perhaps symbolized by the two dancing shepherds) and the evil acts occurring around him.\n\nThe Haywain triptych follows a similar narrative to \"The Garden of Earthly Delights\". The left panel shows God giving form to Eve. Unlike the \"Garden\", though, a narrative sequence flows through the panel in different scenes. At the top, the rebel angels are cast out of Heaven while God sits enthroned, the angels turning into insects as they break through the clouds. Below this, God creates Eve from the rib of Adam. Next, Adam and Eve find the serpent and the tree; the serpent offers them an apple. Finally, at the lowest part of the panel, the angel forces the two out of the Garden of Eden. Adam speaks with the angel; Eve, in a melancholic pose, looks ahead to the right.\n\nThe central panel features a large wagon of hay surrounded by a multitude of fools engaged in a variety of sins, quite apart from the sins of lust which dominates the \"Garden of Earthly Delights\". In the center panel Bosch shows Christ in the sky, not paralleled in the \"Garden\". An angel on top of the wagon looks to the sky, praying, but none of the other figures see Christ looking down on the world. The rightward bow of the figures around the wagon provides the force for the viewer’s eye to move with them on their journey and the cart is drawn by infernal beings which drag everyone to Hell, depicted on the right panel.\n\nThe forward kinetic motion of the participants moves the viewer from present-day sin into unadulterated torture in the realms of Hell. The procession on the left side of this panel bends back into the middle ground, but the right side figures continue in a straight line with the wagon, a more evident progress into damnation.\n\nThe triptych was thoroughly investigated by the scientists at the Bosch Research and Conservation Project with the results published in book form. Bosch's palette was rather limited with pigments including azurite, lead-tin yellow, vermilion and ochres.\n\n"}

Key members of the \"\" team, such as creative director Maxime Béland worked on the game. Gameloft released a handheld version for Apple's iOS on May 27, 2010. There are also versions available for the Android, Windows Phone and Bada. The game was followed by a sequel in 2013 titled \"\".\n\n\"Splinter Cell: Conviction\" introduces a number of new gameplay features to the \"Splinter Cell\" series, one of which is the \"Mark & Execute\" feature, which allows the player to mark specific targets, such as enemies or objects, and shoot them in rapid succession without manually targeting each one. The player can choose to prioritize these targets, so that, for example, he can distract one guard by shooting out a light in his vicinity and then take out another guard. Another new feature is the \"Last Known Position\", which occurs when the player breaks the line of sight of an alerted guard. This creates a visual silhouette where the guard thinks Sam is, allowing the player to flank his enemies.\n\nOther new features include the ability to interrogate characters in real-time, and use objects in the surrounding environment against them. Mission objectives and key plot points are projected onto walls within the in-game world, in order to keep the player immersed in the gameplay. Several other features, such as blending into crowds, improvising gadgets, and interaction with the environment, were announced, and according to creative director Maxime Béland would have given the game \"a lot of \"Bourne Identity\" influence,\" but were scrapped after the development team decided that going in this direction would be taking too much of a risk.\n\nSome of the features that were present in the last four games in the series do not appear in this game. Sam's hybrid night/heat vision goggles and his multipurpose SC-20K assault rifle, which were the mainstay of the last four games, no longer appear. His light sensor is also absent, although change in the screen saturation now shows whether Sam is hidden from view. Sam can no longer move or hide dead bodies, nor can he knock enemies unconscious, as all equipment that helped doing the latter are absent. Lock picking and hacking minigames are also not included in the game. Sam has been equipped with MK.23 and MP-446 pistols with a suppressor and unlimited ammo, which helps him to takedown his enemies in a stealthy way.\n\nOne of Ubisoft's stated goals for \"Conviction\" was to make the game more accessible. According to Béland, \"\" is \"very hardcore\", which turned off many players and disconnected people from the fantasy of being Sam Fisher. Béland contrasted the earlier games in the series with works containing James Bond or Jason Bourne, who \"run fast, they don't make noise, they kill one, two, three or four guys super quickly,\" and he stated that \"Conviction\" delivers a similarly dynamic experience with more of an emphasis on action than previous \"Splinter Cell\" games.\n\nMultiplayer mode in \"Splinter Cell: Conviction\" involves both split screen, System link (Xbox 360), and online cooperative mode, plus a \"Deniable Ops\" mode, involving four modes that pit players against AI enemies in game modes such as \"Hunter\" (where the player must kill a set number of enemies), \"Infiltration\" (where the player must kill a set number of enemies without being seen), \"Last Stand\" (where the player must protect a bomb as enemies try to disarm it), and \"Face-Off\" (a competitive version of \"Hunter\"). \"Face-Off\" is the game's only competitive multiplayer mode, as it features the ability to kill the opposing player. \"Hunter\", \"Infiltration\", and \"Last Stand\" can be played in single-player modes and do not always have to be played with a human partner. The game does not contain the \"Spies Vs Mercenaries\" mode featured in the previous games of the series.\n\nAccording to co-op game director Patrick Redding, the stealth in \"Conviction\" is designed around new core elements like \"Mark & Execute\" and \"Last Known Position\".\n\nThe game's story is divided into two portions. The main portion is the game's single-player campaign, which puts the player in control of Sam Fisher. The \"Prologue\" portion of the game, however, is accessed through the multiplayer co-op mode, which puts two players in control of agents Archer and Kestrel.\n\nTen days prior to the events of the main game, Third Echelon agent \"Archer\" (Edward Yankie) and his Russian counterpart, Voron agent \"Kestrel\" (Alex Ivanovici) are deployed to Nevsky Prospekt in Saint Petersburg, Russia to halt rogue elements of the Russian military from selling advanced warheads on the black market. Intelligence from Andriy Kobin (Elias Toufexis) has pointed to drug and human trafficker Valentin Lesovsky (Mark Camacho) as the broker for the sale, and Archer and Kestrel are to terminate Lesovsky and his associate, Boris Sychev (Alain Goulem), as well as gaining Lesovsky's contact list.\n\nHaving completed their mission, Archer and Kestrel are deployed to the Russian embassy in Baku, Azerbaijan to gather intelligence on an arms deal conducted by former Russian GRU Colonel Leonid Bykhov. They observe the deal and see Bhykov betray his associate, Tagizade, ordering his men to kill him. Archer and Kestrel prevent the destruction of the weapons crates, learning that the weapons Bhykov was going to sell were Block II JDAM missile guidance kits. They interrogate Bhykov, learning that he is working with Major General Kerzakov, who is in the Yastreb Complex, an underground fortress situated underneath Moscow's Red Square.\n\nThey infiltrate the complex and learn the location of the EMP warheads. They render the JDAM kits inoperable by using their portable EMP devices, and download data from multiple servers to trace the EMP devices to the Mozdok Proving Grounds. Sneaking aboard a supply truck, they infiltrate the Proving Grounds and secure the EMP devices with the help of Kobin. During their extraction, Third Echelon director Tom Reed (James A. Woods) calls Archer and orders him to kill Kestrel; concurrently, Kestrel reads Archer's OPSAT (Operational Satellite Uplink) device, forcing him to act in self-defense. Whilst either player can die, the canon ending has Kestrel fatally shooting Archer; overcome with grief and unaware that Kobin has entered, Kestrel is shot in the head.\n\nThe events of the main game take place three years after that of \"\". Former Navy SEAL Victor Coste (Howard Siegel) is being interrogated by a private military company called \"Black Arrow\", and recounts the events of \"Conviction\" in the past tense.\n\nSam Fisher (Michael Ironside) is investigating in Valletta, Malta regarding rumors that the hit-and-run death of his daughter, Sarah, might not have been accidental. As he investigates, Anna \"Grim\" Grímsdóttir (Claudia Besso), Sam's former colleague, contacts him and warns him of the imminent attack by a group of hitmen. Sam neutralizes them and goes after their contractor, Andriy Kobin, a drug runner who was responsible for Sarah's death. He infiltrates Kobin's mansion, kills his guards and interrogates him, but is captured by a Third Echelon Splinter Cell team before being able to extract anything useful.\n\nHe is relocated to Price Airfield in Virginia, where he is to be interrogated by Grim and the Black Arrow. However, Grim kills the guard and releases Sam, revealing that she is working for U.S. President Patricia Caldwell (Lynne Adams), investigating suspicious circumstances concerning Third Echelon Director Tom Reed, Black Arrow, and stolen Russian EMP technology. She claims that Sarah is in fact alive and helps Sam escape the airfield.\n\nAfter escaping, Sam meets Victor Coste at a county fair at the Washington Monument, receives some equipment, and learns that Lucius Galliard (Tyrone Benskin), the CEO of Black Arrow, has tasked the private military company to provide corporate security for White Box Technologies, his recently purchased R&D company specialized in EMP technology. Sam infiltrates White Box Technologies and witnesses Black Arrow murdering scientists that are no longer needed. He hacks a high security White Box computer and retrieves strategic data about an operation involving EMP for Grim's analysts to study. He escapes the facility after a firefight with armed Black Arrow gunmen, triggering an EMP to cover his tracks. He is later directed to the Lincoln Memorial on orders from President Caldwell, in order to eavesdrop on a conversation between Reed and Galliard. The conversation and the subsequent interrogation of Galliard reveals that the operation, due in 24 hours, is funded and organized by a group called \"Megiddo\"; Galliard is shot before he can reveal more. Sam gives chase but the assassin is killed by a car bomb.\n\nSam leaves the scene for the Third Echelon headquarters; after fighting his way into the building, killing all its security forces and recovering a set of sonar goggles from Grim's friend named Charlie Fryman (by Graham Cuthbertson), he raids Reed's office. Instead of finding Reed, Sam finds Kobin and interrogates him. Kobin reveals that Reed, acting on Megiddo's orders, is planning to activate three massive EMP devices in Washington DC and assassinate Caldwell in the ensuing chaos, allowing Vice President Calvin Samson (Larry Day) to take over the presidency. In return, Reed would be promoted. Kobin also reveals that he faked Sarah's death on orders from Grim. Grim confirms this, playing an audio recording of the deceased former Director Irving Lambert (Don Jordan). Sam learns that Lambert had found out that there was a mole in Third Echelon who planned to use Sarah as leverage against Sam. Lambert staged Sarah's death in order to nullify this plan, but was not able to locate the mole. Grim urges an enraged Sam to destroy the EMP device in the Michigan Avenue Reservoir, as Sarah's apartment is within its blast radius. At this time, the Third Echelon building's self-destruct protocol activates and Sam is forced to escape before the building explodes.\n\nWith the aid of Coste, Sam attacks the Michigan Avenue Reservoir. After slaughtering Black Arrow mercenaries defending the site, Sam marks the EMP generators for Coste to destroy from the air. Sam is then extracted by Coste and has a brief reunion with Sarah (Victoria Sanchez) before the two remaining EMPs are activated, destroying most of the electronic defenses in the city and causing general chaos. Shortly afterwards, Coste's helicopter is shot down by a surface-to-air missile, but all three survive. While Coste takes Sarah to safety, Sam journeys through downtown Washington seeing the chaos and fear the EMPs have caused. He assaults the White House, now strewn with United States Secret Service corpses, engaging the occupying Black Arrow mercenaries and Third Echelon troops in combat. After shooting and immobilizing the corrupt Vice President, Sam regroups with Grim.\n\nGrim and Sam must enter the Oval Office without alarming Reed, who may kill the President. To that end, Grim shoots Sam in the left shoulder and pretends to have detained him at gunpoint, allowing them to enter the Oval Office safely. Reed prepares to execute Sam and the President, revealing that Caldwell was going to shut down Third Echelon after Lambert's death. Reed plans to frame Sam for assassinating Caldwell as supposed proof to the country that Third Echelon is still needed. At this point, Sam and Grim spring into action, disarming Reed and killing his escorts. Sam interrogates Reed while United States Army soldiers extract Caldwell. It is then revealed that Reed was the mole Lambert was looking for. At this point, the player has the choice to have Sam or Grim execute Reed. Canonically, Fisher spares Reed only for Grim to execute him.\n\nThe story then returns to Coste's interrogation. Coste states that Sam, in his last conversation has promised to protect him just as he would protect his brother. At that moment, an alarm starts to blare, while an explosion accompanied by gunfire is heard in the background, causing all of the interrogators to abandon the interview.\n\nThe existence of a sequel to \"Double Agent\" was leaked to the internet on September 21, 2006 through a 2GB rar file containing, among other media, 75 concept art images of as-yet unannounced next-generation games uploaded to Ubisoft's public FTP site. The leaked images showed gloomy images of the Washington Monument under military occupation, as well as roadside views of Washington, D.C.\n\n\"Conviction\" was officially announced on May 23, 2007 when Ubisoft released a trailer for the game. It depicted a more rugged-looking Sam with long hair and a fully-grown beard. He had the ability to blend in with the environment, interact with tables and chairs and utilize hand-to-hand combat against enemies, making the game appear less stealth-based than previous games. The lighting and shadow effects also showed a vast improvement over \"Double Agent\". The game was originally due for release on November 16, 2007. However, it missed its initial launch date, and on May 19, 2008, \"Xbox World\" reported that \"Splinter Cell: Conviction\" was \"officially on hold,\" and had been taken \"back to the drawing board.\" While Ubisoft never confirmed this, they did announce that the game had been pushed back to the 2009-2010 fiscal year.\n\nThe game resurfaced at E3 2009, with a completely new visual style and a more casual-looking Sam. The developers confirmed that the \"new\" \"Conviction\" had been in development since early 2008, commenting that \"the gameplay has evolved a lot\" and \"the visual direction is simply much better.\" The game was given a November 2009 release date at E3, but was later pushed back to the first quarter of 2010. After initially announcing a release date of February 23, Ubisoft delayed the game again until April. On February 4, 2010, Ubisoft officially announced that the game would be released on April 13 for the Xbox 360.\n\n\"Conviction\" supports AMD's multi-monitor-technology Eyefinity.\n\nOn July 16, 2007, it was announced that composers Kaveh Cohen and Michael Nielsen, in association with music house Groove Worx, would be composing the score to \"Conviction\", their first score for a video game.

The main points of criticism were its short length and that too much of the title is played in monochrome. GameSpot's Kevin Van Ord awarded the game a score of 8 out of 10, praising its cooperative mode and storytelling, but criticizing its short length and slimmed-down stealth elements, as well as most of the interrogation sections, stating that interrogations were a \"missed opportunity\" and \"more predictable than provocative.\" GameTrailers gave it an 8.9 out of 10 praising the \"top-notch voice acting\" and the game as a whole, saying \"\"Conviction\" is a gripping new chapter in the \"Splinter Cell\" saga.\" \"Game Informer\" gave the game a 9 out of 10 and GamePro gave it a 5 out of 5.\n\n\"Conviction\" had a less welcome reception with some PC reviewers.
