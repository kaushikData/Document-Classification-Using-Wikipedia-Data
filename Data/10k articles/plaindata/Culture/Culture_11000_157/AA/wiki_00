Written by the Australian archaeologist Audrey Meaney, it was published by the company British Archaeological Reports as the 96th monograph in their BAR British Series. Prior to writing the work, Meaney had published several books dealing with Anglo-Saxon burials.\n\nIn the book, Meaney opines that scholars can understand more about Anglo-Saxon beliefs regarding magic by looking at the archaeological evidence for amulets and related magic items found buried in graves. Looking at the literary evidence for magical practices, she goes on to look at a wide variety of items found in Anglo-Saxon inhumation burials which might have had amuletic properties. She categorises such artefacts into a series of overarching categories, including vegetable amulets, mineral amulets, animal amulets, manufactured amulets and found amulets, to each of which she devotes a chapter. Concluding her study, Meaney argues that amulets were primarily worn by women and children in Anglo-Saxon England, and that there were certain females, whom she termed \"cunning women\", who worked in a specific magical capacity for their local communities.\n\nThe book received a mixed review from the academic Hilda Ellis Davidson in the \"Folklore\" journal. Meaney herself produced a rebuttal to Ellis Davidson in the following issue. Meaney's ideas regarding Anglo-Saxon cunning women would subsequently be adopted by fellow archaeologist Tania Dickinson.\n\nPrior to the publication of \"Anglo-Saxon Amulets and Curing Stones\", Meaney had written a number of studies on the archaeological burial record from Anglo-Saxon England. 1964 saw the publication of the \"Gazetteer of Early Anglo-Saxon Burial Sites\", brought out by Allen and Unwin. In 1970, Meaney's book, \"Two Anglo-Saxon Cemeteries at Winnall, Winchester, Hampshire\" was published by the Society for Medieval Archaeology as the fourth title in their monograph series.\n\nChapter one, \"Introduction\" opens with Meaney's discussion of how archaeology can be used to shed light on the cognitive aspects of the past. She explains how she chooses to define terms like \"amulet\", \"talisman\", \"charm\" and \"curing stone\", before making comparisons with contemporary \"good luck charms\" to highlight the pervasiveness of amulets in human society. Moving on, she explores the early Christian attitudes to amulets in Europe using documentary sources, before going on to look specifically at the matter in Anglo-Saxon England. Here, she examines several Early Mediaeval manuscripts, such as the \"Lacnunga\" and \"Bald's Leechbook\", for evidence of written charms which made reference to amulets, before discussing the three known examples of Anglo-Saxon finger rings which had been engraved with a charm in runic script.\n\nProceeding to discuss the existence of amulets and curing stones in Anglo-Saxon burials, she notes that two conditions must apply before an artefact is labelled under one of these two categories. The first is that there should be documentary evidence that \"the object was believed to have magical powers.\" Although recognising that the most applicable documentary evidence should come from Anglo-Saxon England, she refuses to dismiss supporting evidence from a \"related or descendent culture\", and cites examples as varied as the ancient Greek \"Natural History\" by Pliny the Elder to 19th-century British folk customs. Her second condition is that such artefacts should be evidently \"especially valued\" by those who performed the burial, being close to the body, but which were neither beautiful nor useful, implying that they must have had a different, magical purpose.\n\nThe second chapter, entitled \"Vegetable Amulets\", looks at the evidence for herbal amulets in the Old English medical manuscripts, noting how problematic it is to identify specific plant species from the information provided in these sources. Using information from later Middle English sources, Meaney attempts to highlight the magical uses that Anglo-Saxons had for a variety of different plants, including betony, camomile and mugwort. Following on from this, Meaney discusses the evidence of plant-based amulets from Anglo-Saxon cemeteries, noting the existence of flat wooden coils from Welbeck Hill in Lincolnshire, an oak ball from Little Wilbraham in Cambridgeshire and the vegetable fibres found at Polhill in Kent.\n\nChapter three, \"Mineral Amulets\" offers an exploration of the evidence for amulets and curing stones made out of mineral substances, such as rocks and crystals. Making use of both written sources and burial evidence from Anglo-Saxon England and neighbouring parts of Europe, Meaney focuses on the role of amber, jet, amethyst and the potential magical associations which they had in Early Medieval society. She also looks at burial evidence for the use as quartz in creating rock crystal beads and spindle whorls and also the burial of crystal balls and sieve spoons, speculating on any magical uses that such items might have had by comparing them with Medieval literary sources and later folklore. She proceeds to look into the role of quartz pebbles, holed stones, pyrites and chalk and other white substances, all of which have been found in Anglo-Saxon graves.\nMoving into the fourth chapter, \"Animal Amulets\", Meaney discusses possible amulets that were made out of animal products. After discussing Old English literary sources for magical beliefs regarding animal products, she refers to various items found within Anglo-Saxon graves which may have had amuletic properties, including fossil invertebrates like ammonites and echinoids and also shells such as cowries, which were imported to England from the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. Meaney proceeds to look into the wide variety of animal teeth found in Anglo-Saxon graves, including horse, oxen, boar and pig, dog and wolf, beaver and human, speculating as to their potential symbolism. She then rounds off the chapter with a discussion of items carved out of antler and the claws and miscellaneous bones that have sometimes been found in graves from this period.\n\nChapter five, \"Manufactured Amulets\", deals with items that were intentionally crafted by the Anglo-Saxons or neighbouring peoples, possibly with the intention of being used as amulets. Meaney opens the chapter with a look at the miniature models of weapons and tools that were often found in Anglo-Saxon graves, comparing them with toiletry items and debating their possible amuletic uses. She then looks at pendants and in particular at the Anglo-Saxon bucket pendants, making comparisons with similar items in continental Europe. Next, Meaney looks at the various metal knots, rings and keys found in Anglo-Saxon contexts, noting that the latter apparently had phallic associations. Proceeding with this analysis, she then discusses the work-boxes found in multiple female Christian graves, which contained scraps of cloth and other organic materials; Meaney looks into the possible that they are relic boxes, containing sanctified pieces of cloth. Finally, she looks at miscellaneous items such as bronze spangles and bullae found in the Anglo-Saxon context.\n\nThe sixth chapter, which is entitled \"Found Amulets\", looks at \"objects trouvés\" in Anglo-Saxon England, items which had probably been constructed in the preceding pre-Roman and Roman Iron Ages of English history but which had been adopted by Anglo-Saxons as trinkets and in certain cases buried with them. Meaney discusses the Anglo-Saxon use of Roman-era glass beads, either for general ornamentation or as sword beads, making use of later folklore to argue that for the Anglo-Saxons, such beads may have been viewed as amuletic. She proceeds to discuss how certain Anglo-Saxons may have made use of prehistoric worked flints for weather magic, and then their use of coinage produced by the Roman Empire, Byzantine Empire, Merovingians and Visigoths, primarily for ornamentation. Meaney looks at the Anglo-Saxon tradition of burying the deceased with \"something old\", such as a Roman brooch or a sherd of coloured Roman glass, suggesting that these had potential amuletic properties.\n\nThe final chapter offers a conclusion to the study, initially looking at the few amuletic items that were associated with male burials, such as magical inscriptions on armour and weaponry. She then discusses the role of amulets in infant burials before moving on to look at those included in the burials of adult women. She argues that certain female burials with particular collections of amulets represent \"cunning women\" who served their tribe in a magical capacity, using their abilities for both malevolent and benevolent purposes. She rounds off the book with a discussion of the changing fashions in amulets and the changing attitudes towards Anglo-Saxon amulets throughout history.\n\n\"Anglo-Saxon Amulets and Curing Stones\" was reviewed in \"Folklore\", the published journal of The Folklore Society, by the academic Hilda Ellis Davidson.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31916228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31916228", "title": "Body politic", "text": "Body politic\n\nThe body politic is a medieval metaphor that likens a nation to a corporation which had serious historical repercussions throughout recent history and therefore giving the Crown: \"As a legal entity today the Crown as executive is regarded as a corporation sole or aggregate\", a corporate entity. Maitland argues that the Crown (as a legal term) is a convenient cover for ignorance and traces the legal term Crown as corporation sole originally from the 16th century and argues that it was both a political and legal ploy originally reserved for the monarch of the day with the combination of medieval Roman law amalgamated into the early medieval domain of early church property law. The modern understanding of the concept means a body politic comprises all the people in a particular country considered as a single group. The analogy typically includes reference to the sovereign head of government as head of state, though the analogy may also be extended to other anatomical parts, as in political readings of Aesop's fable of \"The Belly and the Members\".\n\nA later European reference to the concept appears in \"The Book of the Body Politic\" (1407) by poet and court writer Christine de Pizan, in which she admits having borrowed the concept from a letter of Plutarch's to the Roman Emperor Trajan but does not mention John of Salisbury's work, \"Policraticus\". The metaphor appears in the French language as the \"corps-état\".\nThe metaphor was elaborated in the Renaissance, and subsequently, as medical knowledge based on Galen was challenged by thinkers such as William Harvey. Analogies were drawn between supposed causes of disease and disorder and their equivalents in the political field, viewed as plagues or infections that might be remedied with purges and nostrums.\n\n The term \"Body politic\" (the political body of society) derives from the mediæval political concept of the King's two bodies first noted by mediaeval historian Ernst Kantorowicz, as a point of theology as much as statehood. However, the person to give the concept some legal bite and codified reality, as much as legitimacy as well as Sovereignty, was the 14th century judge Sir William de Shareshull in 1351 for the offence of high treason in the aftermath of the Barons war. However, by the time of the fifteenth-century judge Sir John Fortescue the concept moves away from theology to jurisprudence in his \"The Difference between an Absolute and a Limited Monarchy\", written from exile in about 1462 . Fortescue explains that the \"character angelus\" (divine character) of the king is his royal power, derived from angels and separate from the frail physical powers of his body. However, he uses the phrase \"body politic\" itself only in its modern sense, to describe the realm, or shared rule, of Brutus, mythical first king of England, and how he and his fellow exiles had covenanted to form a body politic. Unusually for the time, Fortescue was writing in English and not Latin: \"made a body pollitike callid a reawme.\" The early medieval period (13th century) saw a general and radical shift in the idea of the political body and sovereignty and who was to be ultimate ruler of humankind.This constant shift in Translatio imperii and \"The Halo of perpetuity\"(Kantorowicz reasoning) transformed the king's persona from Liturgy to legal science, argues Kantorowicz. However, the Norman conquest proved one thing, quite surprisingly enough, the king wasn't the ultimate and major landowner with just 20% of land ownership as William the Conqueror found out to his disgust and chagrin, which ultimately led to the Domesday book being compiled. With Plenitudo potestatis, Unam sanctam (a Papal bull) extra Ecclesiam nulla salus and the Sun and moon allegory now part of the armoury of jurisdictional power of the papacy with both Canon law, and medieval political theology now becoming(part of the Scholastic movement beginning with Thomas Aquinas and John of Salisbury) a standard bearer for medieval political power which then descended into the infamous Inquisition and heresy (deviation from truth)as the ultimate legal reality which meant both the Roman Catholic Church and Papal supremacy couldn't be ignored(not without fear of excommunication and in some cases judicial execution). The church, which ultimately had powerful claims to sovereignty due to their immense wealth and vast monetary resources which included a clever taxation system establishing the legal validity of the tithe system which baffled legal experts of the day of its historical lineage and origin, such as Sir William Blackstone, for example, not its legal validity; such as their (the church's) enormous network and ownership of land, law making and the then-University and education system.\n\nIn 1550 the jurist Edmund Plowden merged Fortescue's concepts, at the same time removing them from abstraction into a real, physical manifestation in the body of the king. Plowden reports how lawyers codified this notion in an examination of a case of land-ownership turning on a disputed gift by an earlier monarch; they determined that the \"Body politic…that cannot be seen or handled…[is] constituted for the direction of the People…[and] these two bodies are incorporated in one person…the Body politic includes the [king's] Body natural.\" In 1609 Attorney General Edward Coke pronounced his dissenting opinion, that mortal power was God-made while the immortality of royal power existed only as a man-made concept; Coke later succeeded in limiting the royal power of both Charles I and James VI and I with his now infamous judgements of Case of Proclamations and his \"Petition of Right\", which triggered off the English Civil War and would have reverberations right across the country for the next 100 years. When the monarchy, in the person of Charles II, was restored at the end of the Commonwealth the idea remained current and royalty continued to use the notion, as a buttress to its authority, until an assertion of the rights of Parliament brought about the Glorious Revolution of 1688. In the 18th century English Barrister and judge Sir William Blackstone developed further the medieval idea and the legal argument (which still stands today) of the monarch in legal terms \"immortal\" with added emphasis of a quasi divine (\"character angelus\") status.\n\nThe pre-Revolution monarchs of France also claimed legitimacy on this principle, and extended it to include the idea that the king's heir assimilated the \"body politic\" of the old king, in a physical \"transfer of corporeality\", on accession.\n\n"}

It is famous for being the oldest (or one of the oldest) known samples of the use of the Greek alphabet. The text is scratched on a wine jug (oenochoe), which was found in 1871 and is named after the location where it was found, the ancient Dipylon Cemetery, near the Dipylon Gate on the area of Kerameikos in Athens. The jug is attributed to the Late Geometrical Period (750-700 BC). It is now in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens (inv. 192).\n\nThe text is written in an archaic form of the Greek alphabet, with some letter shapes still resembling those of the original Phoenician alphabet. It is written from right to left, with the individual letters mirror-shaped in comparison with the modern forms. It is placed in a circle around the shoulder of the vessel. The text consists of 46 characters, of which the first 35 can easily be read as an hexametric verse in Greek. The fragmentary rest is believed to have been the beginning of the second verse of a distichon, but the exact interpretation is unclear. B. Powell has argued that the final characters may represent a garbled snippet from the middle of an abecedarium (ΚΛΜΝ) by a second hand, someone learning to write. More recently, N. M. Binek has shown that the last six markings can \"be viewed not as letters or as attempts to inscribe letters, but rather as decorative elements fashioned by a second inscriber in accordance with the principles of Geometric idiom,\" inasmuch as the segment roughly mirrors the shapes of letters 9-4 (ΧΡΟΝΥΝ).

{"id": "2267781", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2267781", "title": "Discourse ethics", "text": "Discourse ethics\n\nDiscourse ethics refers to a type of argument that attempts to establish normative or ethical truths by examining the presuppositions of discourse. Variations of this argument have been used in the establishment of egalitarian ethics, as well as libertarian ethics.\n\nGerman philosophers Jürgen Habermas and Karl-Otto Apel are considered the originators of modern discourse ethics. Habermas's discourse ethics is his attempt to explain the implications of communicative rationality in the sphere of moral insight and normative validity. It is a complex theoretical effort to reformulate the fundamental insights of Kantian deontological ethics in terms of the analysis of communicative structures. This means that it is an attempt to explain the universal and obligatory nature of morality by evoking the universal obligations of communicative rationality. It is also a cognitivist moral theory, which means it holds that justifying the validity of moral norms can be done in a manner analogous to the justification of facts. However, the entire project is undertaken as a rational reconstruction of moral insight. It claims only to reconstruct the implicit normative orientations that guide individuals and it claims to access these through an analysis of communication.\n\nThis type of ethics consists of conversations about ideas in civic or community contexts marked by diversity of perspectives requiring thoughtful public engagement. This discourse is made up of differing insights that helps to shape the public's engagement with one another. This type of discourse is meant to protect and to promote the public good. For public discourse ethics to be successful there must be an effective level of civility between people or persons involved. It was Sigmund Freud who once said, \"civilization began the first time an angry person cast a word instead of a rock\" and that statement is something that continues to be seen in society today. The Harvard Law Review accurately examines public discourse and explains it in a manner that is appropriate and conceptually accurate. \"Every man who publishes a book commits himself to the judgement of the public, and anyone may comment upon his performance... [W]hatever their merits, others have a right to pass their judgement upon them-to censure them if they be censurable, and to turn them into ridicule if they be ridiculous\". For the public discourse ethics to be productive there must be accountability on the public stage as the Harvard Law Review calls into question. Without any act of accountability the ethicality of the discourse is no longer valid and cannot go on. Public accountability consists of three basic factors. The factors are a diversity of ideas, an engagement of public decision making, and finally an account for continuing a practice or way of doing something or a means or reason for changing the practice. Finally, public discourse ethics puts a great responsibility on the individual. They must continually be asking questions and finding answers. They will not always be right; and that is okay. As long as they are able to make a positive decision in the end.\n\nHabermas maintains that normative validity cannot be understood as separate from the argumentative procedures used in everyday practice, such as those used to resolve issues concerning the legitimacy of actions and the validity of the norms governing interactions. He makes this claim by making reference to the validity dimensions attached to speech acts in communication and the implicit forms of argumentation they imply (see Universal pragmatics). The basic idea is that the validity of a moral norm cannot be justified in the mind of an isolated individual reflecting on the world. The validity of a norm is justified only intersubjectively in processes of argumentation between individuals; in a dialectic. The validity of a claim to normative rightness depends upon the mutual understanding achieved by individuals in argument.\n\nFrom this it follows that the presuppositions of argumentation would become important. Kant extracted moral principles from the necessities forced upon a rational subject reflecting on the world. Habermas extracts moral principles from the necessities forced upon individuals engaged in the discursive justification of validity claims, from the inescapable presuppositions of communication and argumentation. These presuppositions were the kinds of idealization that individuals had to make in order for communication and argumentation to even begin. For example:\n\nThere were also presuppositions unique to discourse:\n\nThese are all at the center of Habermas's moral theory. Habermas's discourse ethics attempts to distill the idealized moral point of view that accompanies a perfectly rational process of argumentation (also idealized), which would be the moral principle implied by the presuppositions listed above. The key point is that the presuppositions of argumentation and communication that have been rationally reconstructed by Habermas are both factual and normative. This can be said about his entire project because it is explicitly attempting to bridge the gap between the \"is\" and the \"ought.\" Habermas speaks of the mutual recognition and exchanging of roles and perspectives that are demanded by the very structural condition of rational argumentation. He maintains that what is implied in these factual presuppositions of communication is the deep structure of moral norms, the conditions that every valid norm must fulfill.\n\nThe presuppositions of communication express a universal obligation to maintain impartial judgment in discourse, which constrains all affected to adopt the perspectives of all others in the exchange of reasons. From this Habermas extracts the following principle of universalization (U), which is the condition every valid norm has to fulfill:\n\nThis can be understood as the deep structure of all acceptable moral norms, and should not be confused with the principle of discourse ethics (D), which presupposes that norms exist that satisfy the conditions specified by (U).\n\n(D) Only those norms can claim to be valid that meet (or could meet) with the approval of all affected in their capacity as participants in a practical discourse.\n\nThe implications of (U) and (D) are quite profound. (U) claims to be a rational reconstruction of the impartial moral point of view at the heart of all cognitivist moral theories. According to moral cognitivists (e.g. Kant, Rawls etc.), it is only from such a moral point of view that insight into the actual (quasi-factual) impersonal obligations of a general will can be gained, because this perspective relieves decisions from the inaccuracies of personal interests. Of course, Habermas's reconstruction is different because it is intersubjective. That is, Habermas (unlike Kant or Rawls) formulates the moral point of view as it arises out of the multiple perspectives of those affected by a norm under consideration. The moral point of view explicated in (U) is not the property of an individual subject but the property of a community of interlocutors, the results of a complex dialogical process of role taking and perspective exchanging. Furthermore, (U) is deduced from a rational reconstruction of the presupposition of communication, which downgrades the strong transcendentalism of Kantian ethics by establishing a foundation in inner-worldly processes of communication.\n\n(D) on the other hand is a principle concerning the manner in which norms conforming to (U) must be justified through discourse. Again, Habermas takes the task of moral reflection out of the isolated individual's head and gives it to intersubjective processes of communication. What (D) proposes is that moral principles must be validated in actual discourse and that those to be affected by a norm must be able to participate in argumentation concerning its validity. No number of thought experiments can replace a communicative exchange with others regarding moral norms that will affect them. Moreover, this general prescription concerning the type of discourse necessary for the justification of moral norms opens the process of moral deliberation to the kind of learning that accompanies a fallibilistic orientation. (U) and (D) are catalysts for a moral learning process, which although fallible is not relative. The flesh and blood insights of participants in communicative exchange are refracted through the universal guidelines explicated from the deep structures of communication and argumentation. This spawns discourses with a rational trajectory, which are grounded in the particular circumstances of those involved but aimed at a universal moral validity.\n\nThe practical applications of discourse ethics have taken a significant turn after the publication of Habermas' book Between Facts and Norms (1992), where its application to democracy and the legislative process was substantially refined and expanded. Prior to this book, Habermas had left open the question of the various applications of discourse theory to almost any type of consensus oriented group ranging from highly visible political and governmental groups, such as Parliament in Great Britain and Congressional debate in the United States, and other consensus oriented activities as found in public and private institutions such as those supported on various international websites and Wikipedia.\n\n\n"}

The origins of the festival are preserved through oral history. According to folk legend, the wild zebu cattle that roamed the Highlands were first domesticated for food in Imerina under the reign of Ralambo. Different legends attribute the discovery that zebu were edible to the king's servant or to Ralambo himself. Ralambo is credited with founding the traditional ceremony of the fandroana to celebrate this discovery, although others have suggested he merely added certain practices to the celebration of a long-standing ritual. \n\nAccording to one version of the story, while traversing the countryside Ralambo and his men came across a wild zebu so exceptionally fat that the king decided to make a burnt offering of it. As the zebu flesh cooked, the enticing smell led Ralambo to taste the meat. He declared zebu meat to be fit for human consumption. In honor of the discovery, he decided to establish a holiday called \"fandroana\" that would be distinguished by the consumption of well-fattened zebu meat. The holiday was to be celebrated on the day of his birth, which coincided with the first day of the year. To this end, the holiday symbolically represented a community-wide renewal that would take place over a period of several days before and after the first of the year.\n\nAlthough the precise form of the original holiday cannot be known with certainty and has evolved over time, 18th- and 19th-century accounts suggest what the event may have been like. Accounts from these centuries indicate that all family members were required to reunite in their home villages during the festival period. Estranged family members were expected to attempt to reconcile. Homes were cleaned and repaired and new housewares and clothing were purchased. The symbolism of renewal was particularly embodied in the traditional sexual permissiveness encouraged on the eve of the \"fandroana\" (characterized by early 19th-century British missionaries as an \"orgy\") and the following morning's return to rigid social order with the sovereign firmly at the helm of the kingdom. \n\nOn this morning, the first day of the year, a red rooster was traditionally sacrificed and its blood used to anoint the sovereign and others present at the ceremony. Afterward the sovereign would bathe in sanctified water, then sprinkle it upon attendees to purify and bless them and ensure an auspicious start to the year. Children would celebrate the \"fandroana\" by carrying lighted torches and lanterns in a nighttime processional through their villages. The zebu meat eaten over the course of the festival was primarily grilled or consumed as \"jaka\", a preparation reserved uniquely for this holiday. \"Jaka\" was prepared during the festival by sealing shredded zebu meat with suet in a decorative clay jar; this confit would then be conserved in an underground pit for twelve months to be served at the next year's \"fandroana\".\n\nIn November 1943, a \"fandroana\" was held in Toulouse by the authorities of Vichy France. The \"Chef d'état\" Philippe Pétain was dressed as a Merina king and received a wooden zebu sculpture from the \"tirailleurs malgaches\" (Malagasy soldiers) stranded in France after the British invasion of Madagascar.\n"}

Notable phonological features include its uvular r, nasal vowels, and three processes affecting word-final sounds: liaison, a specific instance of sandhi in which word-final consonants are not pronounced unless they are followed by a word beginning with a vowel; elision in which certain instances of (schwa) are elided (such as when final before an initial vowel) and (resyllabification) in which word-final and word-initial consonants may be moved across a syllable boundary, with syllables crossing word boundaries:\n\nAn example of the various processes is this:\n\nPhonetic notes:\n\nAlthough double consonant letters appear in the orthographic form of many French words, geminate consonants are relatively rare in the pronunciation of such words. The following cases can be identified.\n\nThe geminate pronunciation is found in the future and conditional forms of the verbs ('to run') and ('to die'). The conditional form \"il mourrait\" ('he would die'), for example, contrasts with the imperfect form \"il mourait\" ('he was dying'). This is no longer true for most modern speakers, for whom has reduced to in all words. Other verbs that have a double orthographically in the future and conditional are pronounced with a simple : \"il pourra\" ('he will be able to'), \"il verra\" ('he will see').\n\nWhen the prefix combines with a base that begins with \"n\", the resulting word is sometimes pronounced with a geminate and similarly for the variants of the same prefix \"im-\", \"il-\", \"ir-\": \n\nOther cases of optional gemination can be found in words like ('syllable'), ('grammar'), and ('illusion'). The pronunciation of such words, in many cases, a spelling pronunciation varies by speaker and gives rise to widely varying stylistic effects., cited in In particular, the gemination of consonants other than the liquids and nasals is \"generally considered affected or pedantic\". Examples of stylistically marked pronunciations include ('addition') and ('intelligence').\n\nGemination of doubled and is typical of the Languedoc region, as opposed to other southern accents.\n\nA few cases of gemination do not correspond to double consonant letters in the orthography. The deletion of word-internal schwas (see below), for example, can give rise to sequences of identical consonants: \"là-dedans\" ('inside'), \"l'honnêteté\" ('honesty'). Gemination is obligatory in such contexts. The elided form of the object pronoun \"l<nowiki>'</nowiki>\" ('him/her/it') can optionally (in nonstandard, popular speech) be realized as a geminate when it appears after a vowel:\nFinally, a word pronounced with emphatic stress can exhibit gemination of its first syllable-initial consonant:\n\nMany words in French can be analyzed as having a \"latent\" final consonant that is pronounced only in certain syntactic contexts when the next word begins with a vowel. For example, the word ('two') is pronounced in isolation or before a consonant-initial word (\"deux jours\" → 'two days'), but in \"deux ans\" (→ 'two years'), the linking or liaison consonant is pronounced.\n\nStandard French contrasts up to 13 oral vowels and up to 4 nasal vowels. The schwa (in the center of the diagram next to this paragraph) is not necessarily a distinctive sound. Even though it often merges with one of the mid front rounded vowels, its patterning suggests that it is a separate phoneme (see the sub-section Schwa below).\n\nMany dialects do not contrast all of these vowels - see below.\n\nIn contrast with the mid vowels, there is no tense–lax contrast in close vowels. However, non-phonemic lax (near-close) appear in the Quebec and Cajun varieties as allophones of when the vowel is both phonetically short (so not before ) and in a closed syllable, so that e.g. \"petite\" 'small ()' differs from \"petit\" 'small ()' not only in the presence of the final but also in the tenseness of the . Laxing is obligatory only in stressed closed syllables, but also found in other environments to various degrees.\n\nIn Parisian French, are consistently close , but the exact height of is somewhat debatable as it has been variously described as close and near-close .\n\nAlthough the mid vowels contrast in certain environments, there is limited distributional overlap so they often appear in complementary distribution. Generally, close-mid vowels () are found in open syllables, and open-mid vowels () are found in closed syllables. However, there are minimal pairs:\n\nBeyond the general rule, known as the \"loi de position\" among French phonologists, there are some exceptions. For instance, and are found in closed syllables ending in , and only is found in closed monosyllables before , , and .\n\nThe phonemic opposition of and has been lost in the southern half of France, where these two sounds are found only in complementary distribution. The phonemic oppositions of and and of and in terminal open syllables have been lost in all of France, but not in Belgium, where and are still opposed as and .\n\nThe phonemic contrast between front and back is sometimes not maintained in Standard French, which leads some researchers to reject the idea of two distinct phonemes. However, the distinction is still clearly maintained in other dialects such as Quebec French.\n\nWhile there is much variation among speakers in France, a number of general tendencies can be observed. First of all, the distinction is most often preserved in word-final stressed syllables such as in these minimal pairs:\n\nThere are certain environments that prefer one open vowel over the other. For example, is preferred after and before :\n\nThe difference in quality is often reinforced by a difference in length (but the difference is contrastive in final closed syllables). The exact distribution of the two vowels varies greatly from speaker to speaker.\n\nBack is much rarer in unstressed syllables, but it can be encountered in some common words:\n\nMorphologically complex words derived from words containing stressed do not retain it:\n\nEven in the final syllable of a word, back may become if the word in question loses its stress within the extended phonological context:\n\nThe phonetic qualities of the back nasal vowels are not very similar to those of the corresponding oral vowels, and the contrasting factor that distinguishes and is the extra lip rounding of the latter according to some linguists, but other linguists have come to the conclusion that the main difference is in tongue height. Speakers who produce both and distinguish them mainly through increased lip rounding of the former, but many speakers use only the latter phoneme, especially most speakers in northern France such as Paris (but not farther north, in Belgium).\n\nIn some dialects, particularly that of Europe, there is an attested tendency for nasal vowels to shift in a counterclockwise direction: tends to be more open and shifts toward the vowel space of (realised also as ), rises and rounds to (realised also as ) and shifts to or . Also, there also is an opposite movement for for which it becomes more open and unrounds to , resulting in a merger of Standard French and in this case. In Quebec French, two of the vowels shift in a different direction: → , more or less as in Europe, but → and → .\n\nWhen phonetically realised, schwa (), also called \"e \" ('dropped e') and \"e \" ('mute e'), is a mid-central vowel with some rounding. Many authors consider it to be phonetically identical to . Geoff Lindsey suggests the symbol . state, more specifically, that it merges with before high vowels and glides:\nin phrase-final stressed position:\nand that it merges with elsewhere. However, some speakers make a clear distinction, and it exhibits special phonological behavior that warrants considering it a distinct phoneme. Furthermore, the merger occurs mainly in the French of France; in Quebec, and are still distinguished.\n\nThe main characteristic of French schwa is its \"instability\": the fact that under certain conditions it has no phonetic realisation.\n\nPronouncing as is a way to emphasise the syllable. For instance, pronouncing ('baby bottle') instead of is a way to draw attention to the (to clarify the spelling, for example).\n\nIn French versification, word-final schwa is always elided before another vowel and at the ends of verses. It is pronounced before a following consonant-initial word. For example, \"une grande femme fut ici \", would be pronounced , with the at the end of each word being pronounced.\n\nSchwa cannot normally be realised as a front vowel () in closed syllables. In such contexts in inflectional and derivational morphology, schwa usually alternates with the front vowel :\n\nA three-way alternation can be observed, in a few cases, for a number of speakers:\n\nInstances of orthographic that do not exhibit the behaviour described above may be better analysed as corresponding to the stable, full vowel . The enclitic pronoun , for example, always keeps its vowel in contexts like \"donnez-le-moi\" → ('give it to me') for which schwa deletion would normally apply (giving *), and it counts as a full syllable for the determination of stress.\n\nCases of word-internal stable are more subject to variation among speakers, but, for example, \"un rebelle\" → ('a rebel') must be pronounced with a full vowel in contrast to \"un rebond\" → or ('a bounce').\n\nExcept for the distinction still made by some speakers between and in rare minimal pairs like ('to put') vs. ('teacher'), variation in vowel length is entirely allophonic. Vowels can be lengthened in closed, stressed syllables, under the following two conditions:\n\n\nWhen such syllables lose their stress, the lengthening effect may be absent. The vowel of is long in \"Regarde comme elle saute !\", in which the word is phrase-final and therefore stressed, but not in \"Qu'est-ce qu'elle saute bien !\" In accents wherein is distinguished from , however, it is still pronounced with a long vowel even in an unstressed position, as in \"fête\" in \"C'est une fête importante.\"\n\nThe following table presents the pronunciation of a representative sample of words in phrase-final (stressed) position:\n\nIn Parisian French, the close vowels and the mid front at the end of utterances can be devoiced. A devoiced vowel may be followed by a sound similar to the voiceless palatal fricative :\n\nIn Quebec French, close vowels are often devoiced when unstressed and surrounded by voiceless consonants:\nThough a more prominent feature of Quebec French, phrase-medial devoicing is also found in European French.\n\nThe final vowel (usually ) of a number of monosyllabic function words is elided in syntactic combinations with a following word that begins with a vowel. For example, compare the pronunciation of the unstressed subject pronoun, in \"je dors\" ('I am sleeping'), and in \"j'arrive\" ('I am arriving').\n\nThe glides , , and appear in syllable onsets immediately followed by a full vowel. In many cases, they alternate systematically with their vowel counterparts , , and such as in the following pairs of verb forms:\nThe glides in the examples can be analysed as the result of a glide formation process that turns an underlying high vowel into a glide when followed by another vowel: → .\n\nThis process is usually blocked after a complex onset of the form obstruent + liquid (a stop or a fricative followed by or ). For example, while the pair \"loue\"/\"louer\" shows an alternation between and , the same suffix added to \"cloue\" , a word with a complex onset, does not trigger the glide formation: \"clouer\" ('to nail'). Some sequences of glide + vowel can be found after obstruent-liquid onsets, however. The main examples are , as in \"pluie\" ('rain'), , and . They can be dealt with in different ways, as by adding appropriate contextual conditions to the glide formation rule or by assuming that the phonemic inventory of French includes underlying glides or rising diphthongs like and .\n\nGlide formation normally does not occur across morpheme boundaries in compounds like \"semi-aride\" ('semi-arid'). However, in colloquial registers, \"si elle\" ('if she') can be pronounced just like ('sky'), or \"tu as\" ('you have') like \"tua\" ('[he] killed').\n\nThe glide can also occur in syllable coda position, after a vowel, as in ('sun'). There again, one can formulate a derivation from an underlying full vowel , but the analysis is not always adequate because of the existence of possible minimal pairs like ('country') / ('paycheck') and ('abbey') / ('bee'). Schane (1968) proposes an abstract analysis deriving postvocalic from an underlying lateral by palatalization and glide conversion ( → → ).\n\nWord stress is not distinctive in French, so two words cannot be distinguished on the basis of stress placement alone. In fact, grammatical stress is always on the final full syllable (syllable with a vowel other than schwa) of a word. Monosyllables with schwa as their only vowel (, , , etc.) are generally clitics but otherwise may receive stress.\n\nThe difference between stressed and unstressed syllables in French is less marked than in English. Vowels in unstressed syllables keep their full quality, regardless of whether the rhythm of the speaker is syllable-timed or mora-timed (see isochrony). Moreover, words lose their stress to varying degrees when pronounced in phrases and sentences. In general, only the last word in a phonological phrase retains its full grammatical stress (on its last full syllable).\n\nEmphatic stress is used to call attention to a specific element in a given context such as to express a contrast or to reinforce the emotive content of a word. In French, this stress falls on the first consonant-initial syllable of the word in question. The characteristics associated with emphatic stress include increased amplitude and pitch of the vowel and gemination of the onset consonant, as mentioned above. Emphatic stress does not replace, but occurs in tandem with, grammatical stress.\n\nFor words that begin with a vowel, emphatic stress falls on the first syllable that begins with a consonant or on the initial syllable with the insertion of a glottal stop or a liaison consonant.\n\nFrench intonation differs substantially from that of English. There are four primary patterns:\n\n\n\n\n"}

The company is based in Braunschweig, Germany, commonly known as Brunswick in English. Grotrian-Steinweg makes premium grand pianos and upright pianos.\nGrotrian-Steinweg's history dates back to 1835 when the first Steinweg piano factory was built by Heinrich Engelhard Steinweg (later known as Henry Steinway after his emigration to the US where he founded Steinway & Sons). In 1856, Friedrich Grotrian became a partner; in 1865 his son Wilhelm Grotrian and two associates bought the factory and the right to market their pianos as successors to the Steinweg brand. Ensuing generations of Grotrian family members led the company to become one of the finest piano manufacturers in Germany. Grotrian-Steinweg pianos were preferred by some famous pianists, and they received accolades at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Grotrian-Steinweg operated an orchestra and a concert hall, and established sales rooms in a half dozen major cities in Germany, and by 1920, in London as well. At its peak in the late 1920s, Grotrian-Steinweg employed 1,000 people and made 3,000 pianos per year.\n\nEconomic depression in the 1930s and war in the 1940s caused Grotrian-Steinweg to decline severely and then lose its factory completely. The family rebuilt the factory and re-established its reputation for quality work. In the 1950s, an annual piano-playing competition was founded by the company, to identify promising young piano students.\n\nGrotrian-Steinweg sought to expand into the US in the mid-1960s. Steinway & Sons sued to prevent them from using the Steinweg name, resulting in a 1975 decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The case set a precedent in describing \"initial interest confusion\": that the brand Grotrian-Steinweg could cause piano buyers to temporarily confuse its brand with the brand Steinway & Sons. The court ordered Grotrian-Steinweg to stop selling pianos in the US under the \"Steinweg\" name. Afterward, the company formed a business entity named Grotrian Piano Company to sell pianos in North America.\n\nOn 13 January 1803, Georg Friedrich Karl Grotrian, called Friedrich, was born in Schöningen, Germany. He settled in Moscow to sell pianos, beginning around 1830. He joined a partnership in a small piano making firm based in Saint Petersburg, and included these pianos among the various instruments he sold in his successful Moscow music shop.\n\nIn Germany, Heinrich Engelhard Steinweg (1797–1871) started making pianos in 1835 from his house in Seesen at the edge of the Harz mountains; a source of fine beech and spruce wood for the instruments. Among the pianos that Steinweg produced in his first year was a square piano designed by and built for Friedrick Grotrian. (This instrument is now in the Braunschweig museum.) H.E. Steinweg entered three of his pianos in a state fair in 1839, two of them square pianos, but his grand piano brought wide notice. In 1850, H.E. Steinweg took most of his large family to New York City, leaving the piano factory to his eldest son C.F. Theodor Steinweg (1825–1889) who stayed behind to run it under his own name. Meanwhile, in New York City, the Steinweg family Americanized their surname to Steinway and in 1853 they founded the piano manufacturer Steinway & Sons.\nSoon after taking ownership of his father's old factory, C.F. Theodor Steinweg moved it to Wolfenbüttel near Braunschweig. Here he met Friedrich Grotrian who was traveling for business. In 1854, Friedrich Grotrian received the Müller-Mühlenbein pharmacy as an inheritance from an uncle, so he moved back to Germany to manage it. He joined C.F. Theodor Steinweg's piano company as a partner in 1856.\nIn 1857, C.F. Theodor Steinweg and Grotrian moved the piano factory to Braunschweig, setting up shop in a former mayor's mansion at 48 Bohlweg Street in the inner, medieval part of the city. The company employed about 25 people at this time. Friedrich Grotrian died on 11 December 1860, leaving his share of the company to his son Wilhelm (1843–1917). In 1865, C.F. Theodor Steinweg was needed by his family in New York to help manage Steinway & Sons after his brothers Henry and Charles died. Wilhelm Grotrian joined with two of the piano workmen—Adolph Helfferich and H.D.W. Schulz—to buy out C.F. Theodor Steinweg's share of the building. The new partnership paid for the right to use the trademark \"C.F. Th. Steinweg Nachf.\", meaning, \"Successor to C.F. Theodor Steinweg.\" (\"Nachf.\" is an abbreviation for \"Nachfolger\"—German for \"successor\".) The company name became \"Grotrian, Helfferich, Schulz, Th. Steinweg Nachf.\" Wilhelm Grotrian raised two sons in the 1870s: Wilhelm \"Willi\" Grotrian Jr (1868–1931) and Kurt Grotrian (1870–1929).\n\nIn New York City, C.F. Theodor Steinweg (H.E. Steinweg's son) changed his name to C.F. Theodore Steinway, and served as the leader and chief technician of Steinway & Sons for fifteen years. He did not like living in the US, so he kept his home in Braunschweig and traveled back and forth as needed. In 1880 he stopped traveling overseas and started a new Steinway & Sons piano factory in Hamburg, competing with his father's old firm, now called Grotrian-Steinweg, in making pianos for European customers. After establishing the business, Steinway retired to Braunschweig for his last years. He died in 1889, leaving his collection of pianos to the city's museum. The Hamburg factory proved successful in competing against Grotrian-Steinweg—both companies were known for producing premium pianos.\n\nIn the 1880s, Willi Grotrian studied piano making with Wm. Knabe & Co. in Baltimore, Maryland, and with Pleyel, Wolff et Cie in Paris, France. Kurt Grotrian also studied with piano makers in other countries. Their father Wilhelm Grotrian Sr took Willi with him to Chicago in 1893; there, at the World's Columbian Exposition, Grotrian-Steinweg won an award for fine quality. Pianists Eugen d'Albert, Ignacy Jan Paderewski and Clara Schumann expressed a preference for Grotrian-Steinweg pianos. Grotrian-Steinweg was counted among the top German piano manufacturers along with Bechstein, Blüthner, Feurich, Ibach, Lipp and the Hamburg division of Steinway. In 1895, Wilhelm Grotrian Sr made his two sons partners in the business. He told them, \"Lads, build good pianos and the rest will take care of itself.\" Willi Grotrian methodically set about to improve the systems and standards the Grotrian-Steinweg company used to produce pianos. The Grotrian-Steinweg brand was well known for being of the highest quality: the company was named purveyor to some 30 \"Kaisers, Kings and royal houses\". The owners Franz Wilhelm Grotrian, Willi Grotrian and Kurt Grotrian were awarded an imperial and royal warrant of appointment to the court of Austria-Hungary.\n\nIn Braunschweig, Grotrian-Steinweg grew to a workforce of 550 by 1913, producing about 1,600 pianos annually. The Grotrian-Steinweg Orchestra was active in Leipzig under the baton of young conductor Hermann Scherchen. Grotrian-dedicated salesrooms were operating in Leipzig, Hanover, Königsberg, Düsseldorf and Berlin.\n\nDuring World War I, Kurt Grotrian left the factory to serve in the German Army. He was soon wounded and taken prisoner of war. The elder Wilhelm Grotrian died in 1917. Willi Grotrian, his son, led the company but it was greatly reduced in manpower and orders for pianos. After the war, the company resumed as before, expanding sales in 1920 by establishing a London shop under the brand name Grotrian-Steinweg. The workforce increased to 1,000. In 1924, Grotrian-Steinweg built an unusual piano for microtonal music composer Ivan Wyschnegradsky. The piano had three manuals, and strings tuned a quarter tone apart. By 1927, Grotrian-Steinweg was making about 3,000 pianos annually. This number dropped significantly in the 1930s during the Great Depression; fewer than 500 pianos were made in 1931, and the workforce was reduced to less than 200.\n\nKurt Grotrian had become seriously ill in the late 1920s, and in 1928 he made his two sons Erwin (1899–1990) and Helmut (1900–1977) shareholders. In 1929, Kurt Grotrian died of complications from his old war wound. Willi Grotrian died in 1931.\nIn World War II, the Grotrian-Steinweg factory (like many others in Germany) was ordered to switch to fabricating parts for aircraft. The factory was destroyed in 1944 by the bombing of Braunschweig, as was the founder's mansion in the center of town. Afterward, Erwin and Helmut rebuilt the factory. By 1948, production had resumed; composer and pianist Wilhelm Kempff went on record as an admirer of the \"sonority and exquisite execution\" of the post-war work.\n\nIn 1954, Grotrian-Steinweg initiated a piano-playing competition known as \"Grotrian-Steinweg Klavierspielwettbewerb\", featuring young pianists from music schools. The competition took place in the Braunschweig location of the Hertie department store, with audience applause used as the gauge to determine the winner. In 1968, Grotrian-Steinweg entered into talks with the German National Music Council and the Hannover University of Music to increase the scale of the competition. It increased in odd years to encompass a national and international scope. Pianists such as and Lars Vogt gained notice as winners of the competition.\n\nThe first trademark friction between the two piano manufacturers occurred in 1895 when Steinway & Sons sued to stop Grotrian-Steinweg from using the name \"Steinweg\" on its pianos. Steinway lost the case, but in January 1919, Willi and Kurt Grotrian decided to change the family surname to Grotrian-Steinweg to protect the trademark of the family business, in the hope of preventing further lawsuits. In 1925, the company established a sales presence in the US as a Delaware corporation called Grotrian-Steinweg Company. Over the next three years, Grotrian-Steinweg sold only 15 pianos in the US, in addition to a few sold by an independent dealer in New York City. Upon discovering the sales in 1928, Steinway & Sons complained to the distributor and to Grotrian-Steinweg, but in 1929 Grotrian-Steinweg sent 47 pianos to the US. A family representative of Steinway went to Germany to discuss the problem directly with the Grotrian-Steinweg family. Arriving at a private agreement, the two family leaders smoked a \"peace cigar\" and Grotrian-Steinweg subsequently stopped using the names \"Steinweg\" and \"Grotrian-Steinweg\" in the US. In 1930 the Delaware corporation was dissolved, and in the next three years exports from Grotrian-Steinweg to the US decreased then halted completely. In 1950, Grotrian-Steinweg relinquished its old 1926 trademark application, which had never been published.\n\nIn 1961, Knut Grotrian-Steinweg (b. 1935) joined the company. In 1966, the company formed a contract with Wurlitzer to sell Grotrian-Steinweg pianos in the US, and the Steinway company brought suit in New York. The case lasted nine years, winding its way through trial courts and district courts, presenting the litigants' counterclaims and appeals. In 1975, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit heard the arguments in \"Grotrian, Helfferich, Schulz, Th. Steinweg Nachf. v. Steinway & Sons\". Grotrian-Steinweg, the plaintiff, argued that their brand was long established, predating Steinway's in Germany. Steinway & Sons, defendant, counterclaimed that their brand, well known and strongly positive in the US, was weakened by consumers' confusion as to whether the pianos were related. The court affirmed the lower court's ruling in favor of the defendant that piano buyers would be misled in their \"initial interest\" in the two piano brands; \"a potential Steinway buyer may satisfy himself that the less expensive Grotrian-Steinweg is at least as good, if not better, than a Steinway.\" The court felt that Grotrian-Steinweg—a brand not very well known in the US—was unfairly given an extra measure of credibility based on the strong reputation that Steinway & Sons had built. Even though premium piano buyers were understood to be sophisticated and knowledgeable, and would not be confused at the time of purchase about which manufacturer produced which piano, the court held that a \"subliminal confusion\" might be present at the initial attraction to the Grotrian-Steinweg brand. The company was forbidden to sell pianos in the US under the name \"Steinweg\" after 1977. Accordingly, in 1976 Grotrian-Steinweg formed a subsidiary brand for selling pianos in North America: Grotrian Piano Company GmbH.\n\nThe case was the first instance of a court defining the concept now known as \"initial interest confusion\". District Judge Lloyd Francis MacMahon wrote: \"Misled into an initial interest, a potential Steinway buyer may satisfy himself that the less expensive Grotrian-Steinweg is at least as good, if not better, than a Steinway.\" MacMahon's idea about the \"initial interest\" confusion was confirmed by Appeals Court Judge William H. Timbers, writing, \"such initial confusion works an injury to Steinway.\"\n\nThe English-language section of Grotrian's website does not have any reference to the surname \"Steinweg\", unlike the French-, German- and Russian-language versions. This is likely a result of the lawsuit and a wish to minimize liability.\n\nIn 1974, the Grotrian-Steinweg family built a new factory in northwest Braunschweig on Grotrian-Steinweg Street, very near Bundesautobahn 2, a major east–west highway. After Helmut and Erwin Grotrian-Steinweg supervised the construction they retired, leaving Helmut's son Knut in charge. This factory is the current location of Grotrian-Steinweg production. In 1999, Knut Grotrian-Steinweg stepped down from active supervision of the company, and put day-to-day control in the hands of Burkhard Stein, an industrial manager and piano builder. As of 2012, the Grotrian-Steinweg company is owned by the daughters of Erwin Grotrian, with sixth-generation Jobst Grotrian (b. 1969), Knut's son, a shareholder. Annually, the company produces about 500 upright pianos in six sizes and 100 grand pianos in five sizes. Some 20 concert grands are made per year—each one requiring 8 months of manufacture. In 2010, the company issued a special 175-year anniversary model, a upright called \"Composé Exclusif\", of which 50 were produced.\n\nIn 2011, Larry Fine said that Modern Grotrian-Steinweg pianos are among the \"highest quality\"—on par with Hamburg-built Steinways, Faziolis, and Bösendorfers, and higher quality, in his opinion, than New York-built Steinways.\n\nThe following pianists and composers have expressed admiration for Grotrian-Steinweg pianos:\n\n\n"}

The term is usually applied for professional profile images on social media, the 'about us page' or a corporate website and promotional pictures of actors, models, and authors. \n\nIn theater, film, and television, actors, models, singers, and other entertainers are often required to include a head shot, along with their résumé, when applying for a job. These head shots are usually more artistic: they intend to portray the subject in the best possible light. Head shots often feature the actor or actress facing off-center. A performer will often have head shots expressing different poses and expressions to give a potential employer an idea of the subject's range of appearances or expressions. These types of head shots are called \"looks\". It is common for an actor to have different head shots for different roles, but for the most part these consist of a change in attire. The head shots that include a person’s shoulders are called \"three-quarter\" shots. Previously, head shots were often in black-and-white; however, most head shots are now taken in color.\n\nActors' head shots, when printed and not simply uploaded online to an industry database, are done in an 8\"×10\" format. Other promotional images, for example, press shots and lobby prints, may be in many different aspect ratios. Acting head shots are often not photographic prints, instead they are typically printed via a lithographic or laser process.\n\nThe main purpose of an actor's head shot is identification. Therefore, the most important feature of an actor's head shot is that it represents the subject. Theatrical head shots are usually very \"neutral\" looking shots of the actor clearly showing their facial features.\n\nHead shots are intended to show a person as they currently appear and reflect their best qualities. Therefore, if an actor's hair has been recently cut or colored, they would often get a new head shot to reflect their new image. Additionally, if an actor has a scar or facial blemish, it is expected to be visible on the head shot and not digitally removed from the image. Pimples or spots are temporary and, therefore, are usually digitally retouched.\n\nModeling head shots or comp cards, sometimes also called tear sheets, are a compilation of images for casting in one sheet with a résumé of work, name and relevant statistics. They are often done in color; however in some jurisdictions, such as the UK, they may be in black-and-white. Models often use them for castings and modeling work applications. A close-up head shot is often required to show a model's skin complexion for beauty work.\n\nModeling head shots are usually used for:\n\nModels' head shots are also often professionally retouched to ensure their close-up beauty photograph appears perfect without blemishes or spots.\n\nComp cards are one of the cornerstones of a model’s “marketing materials”. They are about 5½×8” and printed on both sides. Almost all \ncomp cards are in color but may include black-and-white images.

A corporation may chose a streamlined background for all its headshots while an individual may chose an action, experience or background objects to identify his or her brand. Large corporations, firms and/or agencies will usually have a manual for the type and style of headshot to be photographed.\n\n"}
{"id": "1666316", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1666316", "title": "Heyoka", "text": "Heyoka\n\nThe heyoka (heyókȟa, also spelled \"haokah,\" \"heyokha\") is a kind of sacred clown in the culture of the Lakota people of the Great Plains of North America. The heyoka is a contrarian, jester, and satirist, who speaks, moves and reacts in an opposite fashion to the people around them. Only those having visions of the thunder beings of the west, the \"Wakíŋyaŋ,\" and who are recognized as such by the community, can take on the ceremonial role of the heyoka.\n\nThe Lakota medicine man, Black Elk, described himself as a \"heyoka,\" saying he had been visited as a child by the thunder beings. (Thunderbirds).\n\nThe \"Heyókȟa\" is thought of as being backwards-forwards, upside-down, or contrary in nature. This manifests by their doing things backwards or unconventionally—riding a horse backwards, wearing clothes inside-out, or speaking in a backwards language. For example, if food is scarce, a \"heyókȟa\" may sit around and complain about how full he is; during a baking hot heat wave, a \"heyókȟa\" might shiver with cold and put on gloves and cover himself with a thick blanket. Similarly, when it is freezing he might wander around naked, complaining that it is too hot. A unique example is the famous \"heyókȟa\" sacred clown called \"the Straighten-Outer\":\n\nThe \"heyókȟa\" symbolizes and portrays many aspects of the sacred beings, the Wakíŋyaŋ. His satire presents important questions by fooling around. They ask difficult questions, and say things others are too afraid to say. Their behavior poses questions as do Zen koans. By reading between the lines, the audience is able to think about things not usually thought about, or to look at things in a different way.\n\nPrincipally, the \"heyókȟa\" functions both as a mirror and a teacher, using extreme behaviors to mirror others, and forcing them to examine their own doubts, fears, hatreds, and weaknesses. \"Heyókȟa\" have the power to heal emotional pain; such power comes from the experience of shame—they sing of shameful events in their lives, beg for food, and live as clowns. They provoke laughter in distressing situations of despair, and provoke fear and chaos when people feel complacent and overly secure, to keep them from taking themselves too seriously or believing they are more powerful than they are.\n\nIn addition, sacred clowns serve an important role in shaping tribal codes. Unbound by societal constraints, \"heyókȟa\" are able to violate cultural taboos freely and thus critique established customs. Paradoxically, however, by violating these norms and taboos, they help to define the accepted boundaries, rules, and societal guidelines for ethical and moral behavior. They are the only ones who can ask \"Why?\" about sensitive topics; they use satire to question the specialists and carriers of sacred knowledge or those in positions of power and authority.\n\nIn Lakota mythology, \"Heyókȟa\" is also a spirit of thunder and lightning. He is said to use the wind as sticks to beat the drum of thunder. His emotions are portrayed opposite the norm; he laughs when he is sad and cries when he is happy, cold makes him sweat and heat makes him shiver. In art, he is depicted as having two horns, which marks him as a hunting spirit.. In some visions, he also appeared as a snow bird, a swallow, a horse, a dog, a night hawk, a frog, or a dragonfly. \n\nIn 2013, Half Acre brewery in Chicago, Illinois released what they called Heyoka IPA, which became one of their signature beers. It won a silver medal at the Great American Beer Festival in October 2014. Members of the American Indian Movement and other Native American activists complained, arguing that giving the name of a sacred figure in Lakota spirituality to a beer constituted cultural appropriation. Half Acre renamed their beer \"Senita\" (perhaps after the Senita cactus found in the American Southwest that is depicted on the former \"Heyoka\" beer can).\n\n\n"}

The \"law\" is a statement regarding the difficulty of accurately estimating the time it will take to complete tasks of substantial complexity. It is often cited by programmers, especially in discussions of techniques to improve productivity, such as \"The Mythical Man-Month\" or extreme programming. The recursive nature of the law is a reflection of the widely experienced difficulty of estimating complex tasks despite all best efforts, including knowing that the task is complex.\n\nThe law was initially introduced in connection with a discussion of chess-playing computers, where top-level players were continually beating machines, even though the machines outweighed the players in recursive analysis. The intuition was that the players were able to focus on particular positions instead of following every possible line of play to its conclusion. Hofstadter wrote in 1979, \"In the early days of computer chess, people used to estimate that it would be ten years until a computer (or program) was world champion. But after ten years had passed, it seemed that the day a computer would become world champion was still more than ten years away ... This is just one more piece of evidence for the rather recursive Hofstadter's Law:\" Notably, that day did indeed come, when Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov in 1997, which indicates that the Law of Accelerating Returns may take effect when the task is repeated, thus counteracting -- and [in some cases] overpowering -- Hofstadter's law.\n\n"}

{"id": "3765637", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3765637", "title": "Intelligent tutoring system", "text": "Intelligent tutoring system\n\nAn intelligent tutoring system (ITS) is a computer system that aims to provide immediate and customized instruction or feedback to learners, usually without requiring intervention from a human teacher. ITSs have the common goal of enabling learning in a meaningful and effective manner by using a variety of computing technologies. There are many examples of ITSs being used in both formal education and professional settings in which they have demonstrated their capabilities and limitations. There is a close relationship between intelligent tutoring, cognitive learning theories and design; and there is ongoing research to improve the effectiveness of ITS. An ITS typically aims to replicate the demonstrated benefits of one-to-one, personalized tutoring, in contexts where students would otherwise have access to one-to-many instruction from a single teacher (e.g., classroom lectures), or no teacher at all (e.g., online homework). ITSs are often designed with the goal of providing access to high quality education to each and every student.\n\nThe possibility of intelligent machines have been discussed for centuries. Blaise Pascal created the first calculating machine capable of mathematical functions in the 17th century simply called Pascal's Calculator. At this time the mathematician and philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz envisioned machines capable of reasoning and applying rules of logic to settle disputes (Buchanan, 2006). These early works contributed to the development of the computer and future applications.\n\nThe concept of intelligent machines for instructional use date back as early as 1924, when Sidney Pressey of Ohio State University created a mechanical teaching machine to instruct students without a human teacher. His machine resembled closely a typewriter with several keys and a window that provided the learner with questions. The Pressey Machine allowed user input and provided immediate feedback by recording their score on a counter.\n\nPressey himself was influenced by Edward L. Thorndike, a learning theorist and educational psychologist at the Columbia University Teacher College of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Thorndike posited laws for maximizing learning. Thorndike's laws included the law of effect, the law of exercise, and the law of recency. Following later standards, Pressey's teaching and testing machine would not be considered intelligent as it was mechanically run and was based on one question and answer at a time, but it set an early precedent for future projects.\nBy the 1950s and 1960s, new perspectives on learning were emerging. Burrhus Frederic \"B.F.\" Skinner at Harvard University did not agree with Thorndike's learning theory of connectionism or Pressey's teaching machine. Rather, Skinner was a behaviourist who believed that learners should construct their answers and not rely on recognition. He too, constructed a teaching machine structured using an incremental mechanical system that would reward students for correct responses to questions.\n\nIn the period following the second world war, mechanical binary systems gave way to binary based electronic machines. These machines were considered intelligent when compared to their mechanical counterparts as they had the capacity to make logical decisions. However, the study of defining and recognizing a machine intelligence was still in its infancy.\n\nAlan Turing, a mathematician, logician and computer scientist, linked computing systems to thinking. One of his most notable papers outlined a hypothetical test to assess the intelligence of a machine which came to be known as the Turing test. Essentially, the test would have a person communicate with two other agents, a human and a computer asking questions to both recipients. The computer passes the test if it can respond in such a way that the human posing the questions cannot differentiate between the other human and the computer. The Turing test has been used in its essence for more than two decades as a model for current ITS development. The main ideal for ITS systems is to effectively communicate. As early as the 1950s programs were emerging displaying intelligent features. Turing's work as well as later projects by researchers such as Allen Newell, Clifford Shaw, and Herb Simon showed programs capable of creating logical proofs and theorems. Their program, The Logic Theorist exhibited complex symbol manipulation and even generation of new information without direct human control and is considered by some to be the first AI program. Such breakthroughs would inspire the new field of Artificial Intelligence officially named in 1956 by John McCarthy in 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference. This conference was the first of its kind that was devoted to scientists and research in the field of AI.\n\nThe latter part of the 1960s and 1970s saw many new CAI (Computer-Assisted instruction) projects that built on advances in computer science. The creation of the ALGOL programming language in 1958 enabled many schools and universities to begin developing Computer Assisted Instruction (CAI) programs. Major computer vendors and federal agencies in the US such as IBM, HP, and the National Science Foundation funded the development of these projects. Early implementations in education focused on programmed instruction (PI), a structure based on a computerized input-output system. Although many supported this form of instruction, there was limited evidence supporting its effectiveness. The programming language LOGO was created in 1967 by Wally Feurzeig, Cynthia Solomon, and Seymour Papert as a language streamlined for education. PLATO, an educational terminal featuring displays, animations, and touch controls that could store and deliver large amounts of course material, was developed by Donald Bitzer in the University of Illinois in the early 1970s. Along with these, many other CAI projects were initiated in many countries including the US, the UK, and Canada.\n\nAt the same time that CAI was gaining interest, Jaime Carbonell suggested that computers could act as a teacher rather than just a tool (Carbonell, 1970). A new perspective would emerge that focused on the use of computers to intelligently coach students called Intelligent Computer Assisted Instruction or Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). Where CAI used a behaviourist perspective on learning based on Skinner's theories (Dede & Swigger, 1988), ITS drew from work in cognitive psychology, computer science, and especially artificial intelligence. There was a shift in AI research at this time as systems moved from the logic focus of the previous decade to knowledge based systems—systems could make intelligent decisions based on prior knowledge (Buchanan, 2006). Such a program was created by Seymour Papert and Ira Goldstein who created Dendral, a system that predicted possible chemical structures from existing data. Further work began to showcase analogical reasoning and language processing. These changes with a focus on knowledge had big implications for how computers could be used in instruction. The technical requirements of ITS, however, proved to be higher and more complex than CAI systems and ITS systems would find limited success at this time.\n\nTowards the latter part of the 1970s interest in CAI technologies began to wane. Computers were still expensive and not as available as expected. Developers and instructors were reacting negatively to the high cost of developing CAI programs, the inadequate provision for instructor training, and the lack of resources.\n\nThe microcomputer revolution in the late 1970s and early 1980s helped to revive CAI development and jumpstart development of ITS systems. Personal computers such as the Apple 2, Commodore PET, and TRS-80 reduced the resources required to own computers and by 1981, 50% of US schools were using computers (Chambers & Sprecher, 1983). Several CAI projects utilized the Apple 2 as a system to deliver CAI programs in high schools and universities including the British Columbia Project and California State University Project in 1981.\n\nThe early 1980s would also see Intelligent Computer-Assisted Instruction (ICAI) and ITS goals diverge from their roots in CAI. As CAI became increasingly focused on deeper interactions with content created for a specific area of interest, ITS sought to create systems that focused on knowledge of the task and the ability to generalize that knowledge in non-specific ways (Larkin & Chabay, 1992). The key goals set out for ITS were to be able to teach a task as well as perform it, adapting dynamically to its situation. In the transition from CAI to ICAI systems, the computer would have to distinguish not only between the correct and incorrect response but the type of incorrect response to adjust the type of instruction. Research in Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Psychology fueled the new principles of ITS. Psychologists considered how a computer could solve problems and perform 'intelligent' activities. An ITS programme would have to be able to represent, store and retrieve knowledge and even search its own database to derive its own new knowledge to respond to learner's questions. Basically, early specifications for ITS or (ICAI) require it to \"diagnose errors and tailor remediation based on the diagnosis\" (Shute & Psotka, 1994, p. 9). The idea of diagnosis and remediation is still in use today when programming ITS.\n\nA key breakthrough in ITS research was the creation of LISPITS, a program that implemented ITS principles in a practical way and showed promising effects increasing student performance. LISPITS was developed and researched in 1983 as an ITS system for teaching students the LISP programming language (Corbett & Anderson, 1992). LISPITS could identify mistakes and provide constructive feedback to students while they were performing the exercise. The system was found to decrease the time required to complete the exercises while improving student test scores (Corbett & Anderson, 1992). Other ITS systems beginning to develop around this time include TUTOR created by Logica in 1984 as a general instructional tool and PARNASSUS created in Carnegie Mellon University in 1989 for language instruction.\n\nAfter the implementation of initial ITS, more researchers created a number of ITS for different students. In the late 20th century, Intelligent Tutoring Tools (ITTs) was developed by the Byzantium project, which involved six universities. The ITTs were general purpose tutoring system builders and many institutions had positive feedback while using them. (Kinshuk, 1996) This builder, ITT, would produce an Intelligent Tutoring Applet (ITA) for different subject areas. Different teachers created the ITAs and built up a large inventory of knowledge that was accessible by others through the Internet. Once an ITS was created, teachers could copy it and modify it for future use. This system was efficient and flexible. However, Kinshuk and Patel believed that the ITS was not designed from an educational point of view and was not developed based on the actual needs of students and teachers (Kinshuk and Patel, 1997). Recent work has employed ethnographic and design research methods to examine the ways ITSs are actually used by students and teachers across a range of contexts, often revealing unanticipated needs that they meet, fail to meet, or in some cases, even create.\n\nModern day ITSs typically try to replicate the role of a teacher or a teaching assistant, and increasingly automate pedagogical functions such as problem generation, problem selection, and feedback generation. However, given a current shift towards blended learning models, recent work on ITSs has begun focusing on ways these systems can effectively leverage the complementary strengths of human-led instruction from a teacher or peer, when used in co-located classrooms or other social contexts.\n\nThere were three ITS projects that functioned based on conversational dialogue: AutoTutor, Atlas (Freedman, 1999), and Why2. The idea behind these projects was that since students learn best by constructing knowledge themselves, the programs would begin with leading questions for the students and would give out answers as a last resort. AutoTutor's students focused on answering questions about computer technology, Atlas's students focused on solving quantitative problems, and Why2's students focused on explaining physical systems qualitatively. (Graesser, VanLehn, and others, 2001) Other similar tutoring systems such as Andes (Gertner, Conati, and VanLehn, 1998) tend to provide hints and immediate feedback for students when students have trouble answering the questions. They could guess their answers and have correct answers without deep understanding of the concepts. Research was done with a small group of students using Atlas and Andes respectively. The results showed that students using Atlas made significant improvements compared with students who used Andes. However, since the above systems require analysis of students' dialogues, improvement is yet to be made so that more complicated dialogues can be managed.\n\nIntelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) consist of four basic components based on a general consensus amongst researchers (Nwana,1990; Freedman, 2000; Nkambou et al., 2010):\n\nThe \"domain model\" (also known as the cognitive model or expert knowledge model) is built on a theory of learning, such as the ACT-R theory which tries to take into account all the possible steps required to solve a problem. More specifically, this model \"contains the concepts, rules, and problem-solving strategies of the domain to be learned. It can fulfill several roles: as a source of expert knowledge, a standard for evaluating the student's performance or for detecting errors, etc.\" (Nkambou et al., 2010, p. 4). Another approach for developing domain models is based on Stellan Ohlsson's Theory of Learning from performance errors, known as constraint-based modelling (CBM). In this case, the domain model is presented as a set of constraints on correct solutions.\n\nThe \"student model\" can be thought of as an overlay on the domain model. It is considered as the core component of an ITS paying special attention to student's cognitive and affective states and their evolution as the learning process advances. As the student works step-by-step through their problem solving process, an ITS engages in a process called \"model tracing\". Anytime the student model deviates from the domain model, the system identifies, or \"flags\", that an error has occurred. On the other hand, in constraint-based tutors the student model is represented as an overlay on the constraint set. Constraint-based tutors evaluate the student's solution against the constraint set, and identify satisfied and violated constraints. if there are any violated constraints, the student's solution is incorrect, and the ITS provides feedback on those constraints. Constraint-based tutors provide negative feedback (i.e. feedback on errors) and also positive feedback \n\nThe \"tutor model\" accepts information from the domain and student models and makes choices about tutoring strategies and actions. At any point in the problem-solving process the learner may request guidance on what to do next, relative to their current location in the model. In addition, the system recognizes when the learner has deviated from the production rules of the model and provides timely feedback for the learner, resulting in a shorter period of time to reach proficiency with the targeted skills. The tutor model may contain several hundred production rules that can be said to exist in one of two states, \"learned\" or \"unlearned\". Every time a student successfully applies a rule to a problem, the system updates a probability estimate that the student has learned the rule. The system continues to drill students on exercises that require effective application of a rule until the probability that the rule has been learned reaches at least 95% probability.\n\n\"Knowledge tracing\" tracks the learner's progress from problem to problem and builds a profile of strengths and weaknesses relative to the production rules. The cognitive tutoring system developed by John Anderson at Carnegie Mellon University presents information from knowledge tracing as a \"skillometer\", a visual graph of the learner's success in each of the monitored skills related to solving algebra problems. When a learner requests a hint, or an error is flagged, the knowledge tracing data and the skillometer are updated in real-time.\n\nThe \"user interface\" component \"integrates three types of information that are needed in carrying out a dialogue: knowledge about patterns of interpretation (to understand a speaker) and action (to generate utterances) within dialogues; domain knowledge needed for communicating content; and knowledge needed for communicating intent\" (Padayachee, 2002, p. 3).\n\nNkambou et al. (2010) make mention of Nwana's (1990) review of different architectures underlining a strong link between architecture and paradigm (or philosophy). Nwana (1990) declares, \"[I]t is almost a rarity to find two ITSs based on the same architecture [which] results from the experimental nature of the work in the area\" (p. 258). He further explains that differing tutoring philosophies emphasize different components of the learning process (i.e., domain, student or tutor). The architectural design of an ITS reflects this emphasis, and this leads to a variety of architectures, none of which, individually, can support all tutoring strategies (Nwana, 1990, as cited in Nkambou et al., 2010). Moreover, ITS projects may vary according to the relative level of intelligence of the components. As an example, a project highlighting intelligence in the domain model may generate solutions to complex and novel problems so\nthat students can always have new problems to work on, but it might only have simple methods for teaching those problems, while a system that concentrates on multiple or novel ways of teaching a particular topic might find a less sophisticated representation of that content sufficient.\n\nApart from the discrepancy amongst ITS architectures each emphasizing different elements, the development of an ITS is much the same as any instructional design process. Corbett et al. (1997) summarized ITS design and development as consisting of four iterative stages: (1) needs assessment, (2) cognitive task analysis, (3) initial tutor implementation and (4) evaluation.\n\nThe first stage known as needs assessment, is common to any instructional design process, especially software development. This involves a \"learner analysis\", consultation with subject matter experts and/or the instructor(s). This first step is part of the development of the expert/knowledge and student domain. The goal is to specify learning goals and to outline a general plan for the curriculum; it is imperative not to computerize traditional concepts but develop a new curriculum structure by defining the task in general and understanding learners' possible behaviours dealing with the task and to a lesser degree the tutor's behavior. In doing so, three crucial dimensions need to be dealt with: (1) the probability a student is able to solve problems; (2) the time it takes to reach this performance level and (3) the probability the student will actively use this knowledge in the future. Another important aspect that requires analysis is cost effectiveness of the interface. Moreover, teachers and student entry characteristics such as prior knowledge must be assessed since both groups are going to be system users.\n\nThe second stage, cognitive task analysis, is a detailed approach to expert systems programming with the goal of developing a valid computational model of the required problem solving knowledge. Chief methods for developing a domain model include: (1) interviewing domain experts, (2) conducting \"think aloud\" protocol studies with domain experts, (3) conducting \"think aloud\" studies with novices and (4) observation of teaching and learning behavior. Although the first method is most commonly used, experts are usually incapable of reporting cognitive components. The \"think aloud\" methods, in which the experts is asked to report aloud what s/he is thinking when solving typical problems, can avoid this problem. Observation of actual online interactions between tutors and students provides information related to the processes used in problem-solving, which is useful for building dialogue or interactivity into tutoring systems.\n\nThe third stage, initial tutor implementation, involves setting up a problem solving environment to enable and support an authentic learning process. This stage is followed by a series of evaluation activities as the final stage which is again similar to any software development project.\n\nThe fourth stage, evaluation includes (1) pilot studies to confirm basic usability and educational impact; (2) formative evaluations of the system under development, including (3) parametric studies that examine the effectiveness of system features and finally, (4) summative evaluations of the final tutor's effect: learning rate and asymptotic achievement levels.\n\nEight principles of ITS design and development\n\nAnderson et al. (1987) outlined eight principles for intelligent tutor design and Corbett et al. (1997) later elaborated on those principles highlighting an all-embracing principle which they believed governed intelligent tutor design, they referred to this principle as:\n\nPrinciple 0: An intelligent tutor system should enable the student to work to the successful conclusion of problem solving.\n\nAll this is a substantial amount of work, even if authoring tools have become available to ease the task. This means that building an ITS is an option only in situations in which they, in spite of their relatively high development costs, still reduce the overall costs through reducing the need for human instructors or sufficiently boosting overall productivity. Such situations occur when large groups need to be tutored simultaneously or many replicated tutoring efforts are needed. Cases in point are technical training situations such as training of military recruits and high school mathematics. One specific type of intelligent tutoring system, the Cognitive Tutor, has been incorporated into mathematics curricula in a substantial number of United States high schools, producing improved student learning outcomes on final exams and standardized tests. Intelligent tutoring systems have been constructed to help students learn geography, circuits, medical diagnosis, computer programming, mathematics, physics, genetics, chemistry, etc. Intelligent Language Tutoring Systems (ILTS), e.g. this one, teach natural language to first or second language learners. ILTS requires specialized natural language processing tools such as large dictionaries and morphological and grammatical analyzers with acceptable coverage.\n\nDuring the rapid expansion of the web boom, new computer-aided instruction paradigms, such as e-learning and distributed learning, provided an excellent platform for ITS ideas. Areas that have used ITS include natural language processing, machine learning, planning, multi-agent systems, ontologies, semantic Web, and social and emotional computing. In addition, other technologies such as multimedia, object-oriented systems, modeling, simulation, and statistics have also been connected to or combined with ITS. Historically non-technological areas such as the educational sciences and psychology have also been influenced by the success of ITS.\n\nIn recent years, ITS has begun to move away from the search-based to include a range of practical applications. ITS have expanded across many critical and complex cognitive domains, and the results have been far reaching. ITS systems have cemented a place within formal education and these systems have found homes in the sphere of corporate training and organizational learning. ITS offers learners several affordances such as individualized learning, just in time feedback, and flexibility in time and space.\n\nWhile Intelligent tutoring systems evolved from research in cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence, there are now many applications found in education and in organizations. Intelligent tutoring systems can be found in online environments or in a traditional classroom computer lab, and are used in K-12 classrooms as well as in universities. There are a number of programs that target mathematics but applications can be found in health sciences, language acquisition, and other areas of formalized learning.\n\nReports of improvement in student comprehension, engagement, attitude, motivation, and academic results have all contributed to the ongoing interest in the investment in and research of theses systems. The personalized nature of the intelligent tutoring systems affords educators the opportunity to create individualized programs. Within education there are a plethora of intelligent tutoring systems, an exhaustive list does not exist but several of the more influential programs are listed below.\n\nAlgebra Tutor\nPAT (PUMP Algebra Tutor or Practical Algebra Tutor) developed by the Pittsburgh Advanced Cognitive Tutor Center at Carnegie Mellon University, engages students in anchored learning problems and uses modern algebraic tools in order to engage students in problem solving and in sharing of their results. The aim of PAT is to tap into a students' prior knowledge and everyday experiences with mathematics in order to promote growth. The success of PAT is well documented (ex. Miami-Dade County Public Schools Office of Evaluation and Research) from both a statistical (student results) and emotional (student and instructor feedback) perspective.\n\nSQL-Tutor is the first ever constraint-based tutor developed by the Intelligent Computer Tutoring Group (ICTG) at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand. SQL-Tutor teaches students how to retrieve data from databases using the SQL SELECT statement.\n\nEER-Tutor is a constraint-based tutor (developed by ICTG) that teaches conceptual database design using the Entity Relationship model. An earlier version of EER-Tutor was KERMIT, a stand-alone tutor for ER modelling, whjich was shown to results in significant improvement of student's knowledge after one hour of learning (with the effect size of 0.6).\n\nCOLLECT-UML is a constraint-based tutor that supports pairs of students working collaboratively on UML class diagrams. The tutor provides feedback on the domain level as well as on collaboration.\n\nMathematics Tutor\nThe Mathematics Tutor (Beal, Beck & Woolf, 1998) helps students solve word problems using fractions, decimals and percentages. The tutor records the success rates while a student is working on problems while providing subsequent, lever-appropriate problems for the student to work on. The subsequent problems that are selected are based on student ability and a desirable time in is estimated in which the student is to solve the problem.\n\neTeacher\neTeacher (Schiaffino et al., 2008) is an intelligent agent or pedagogical agent, that supports personalized e-learning assistance. It builds student profiles while observing student performance in online courses. eTeacher then uses the information from the student's performance to suggest a personalized courses of action designed to assist their learning process.\n\nZOSMAT\nZOSMAT was designed to address all the needs of a real classroom. It follows and guides a student in different stages of their learning process. This is a student-centered ITS does this by recording the progress in a student's learning and the student program changes based on the student's effort. ZOSMAT can be used for either individual learning or in a real classroom environment alongside the guidance of a human tutor.\n\nREALP\nREALP was designed to help students enhance their reading comprehension by providing reader-specific lexical practice and offering personalized practice with useful, authentic reading materials gathered from the Web. The system automatically build a user model according to student's performance. After reading, the student is given a series of exercises based on the target vocabulary found in reading.\n\nCIRCSlM-Tutor\nCIRCSIM_Tutor is an intelligent tutoring system that is used with first year medical students at the Illinois Institute of Technology. It uses natural dialogue based, Socratic language to help students learn about regulating blood pressure.\n\nWhy2-Atlas\nWhy2-Atlas is an ITS that analyses students explanations of physics principles. The students input their work in paragraph form and the program converts their words into a proof by making assumptions of student beliefs that are based on their explanations. In doing this, misconceptions and incomplete explanations are highlighted. The system then addresses these issues through a dialogue with the student and asks the student to correct their essay. A number of iterations may take place before the process is complete.\n\nSmartTutor\nThe University of Hong Kong (HKU) developed a SmartTutor to support the needs of continuing education students. Personalized learning was identified as a key need within adult education at HKU and SmartTutor aims to fill that need. SmartTutor provides support for students by combining Internet technology, educational research and artificial intelligence.\n\nAutoTutor\nAutoTutor assists college students in learning about computer hardware, operating systems and the Internet in an introductory computer literacy course by simulating the discourse patterns and pedagogical strategies of a human tutor. AutoTutor attempts to understand learner's input from the keyboard and then formulate dialog moves with feedback, prompts, correction and hints.\n\nActiveMath\nActiveMath is a web-based, adaptive learning environment for mathematics. This system strives for improving long-distance learning, for complementing traditional classroom teaching, and for supporting individual and lifelong learning.\n\nESC101-ITS\nThe Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India developed the ESC101-ITS, an intelligent tutoring system for introductory programming problems.\n\nGeneralized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT) is an educational software designed for creation of computer-based tutoring systems. Developed by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory from 2009 to 2011, GIFT was released for commercial use in May 2012. GIFT is open-source and domain independent, and can be downloaded online for free. The software allows an instructor to design a tutoring program that can cover various disciplines through adjustments to existing courses. It includes coursework tools intended for use by researchers, instructional designers, instructors, and students. GIFT is compatible with other teaching materials, such as PowerPoint presentations, which can be integrated into the program.\n\nSHERLOCK\n\"SHERLOCK\" is used to train Air Force technicians to diagnose problems in the electrical systems of F-15 jets. The ITS creates faulty schematic diagrams of systems for the trainee to locate and diagnose. The ITS provides diagnostic readings allowing the trainee to decide whether the fault lies in the circuit being tested or if it lies elsewhere in the system. Feedback and guidance are provided by the system and help is available if requested.\n\nCardiac Tutor\nThe Cardiac Tutor's aim is to support advanced cardiac support techniques to medical personnel. The tutor presents cardiac problems and, using a variety of steps, students must select various interventions. Cardiac Tutor provides clues, verbal advice, and feedback in order to personalize and optimize the learning. Each simulation, regardless of whether the students were successfully able to help their patients, results in a detailed report which students then review.\n\nCODES\nCooperative Music Prototype Design is a Web-based environment for cooperative music prototyping. It was designed to support users, especially those who are not specialists in music, in creating musical pieces in a prototyping manner. The musical examples (prototypes) can be repeatedly tested, played and modified. One of the main aspects of CODES is interaction and cooperation between the music creators and their partners.\n\nAssessing the effectiveness of ITS programs is problematic. ITS vary greatly in design, implementation, and educational focus. When ITS are used in a classroom, the system is not only used by students, but by teachers as well. This usage can create barriers to effective evaluation for a number of reasons; most notably due to teacher intervention in student learning.\n\nTeachers often have the ability to enter new problems into the system or adjust the curriculum. In addition, teachers and peers often interact with students while they learn with ITSs (e.g., during an individual computer lab session or during classroom lectures falling in between lab sessions) in ways that may influence their learning with the software. Prior work suggests that the vast majority of students' help-seeking behavior in classrooms using ITSs may occur entirely outside of the software - meaning that the nature and quality of peer and teacher feedback in a given class may be an important mediator of student learning in these contexts. In addition, aspects of classroom climate, such as students' overall level of comfort in publicly asking for help, or the degree to which a teacher is physically active in monitoring individual students may add additional sources of variation across evaluation contexts. All of these variables make evaluation of an ITS complex, and may help explain variation in results across evaluation studies.\n\nDespite the inherent complexities, numerous studies have attempted to measure the overall effectiveness of ITS, often by comparisons of ITS to human tutors. Reviews of early ITS systems (1995) showed an effect size of \"d\" = 1.0 in comparison to no tutoring, where as human tutors were given an effect size of \"d\" = 2.0. Kurt VanLehn's much more recent overview (2011) of modern ITS found that there was no statistical difference in effect size between expert one-on-one human tutors and step-based ITS. Some individual ITS have been evaluated more positively than others. Studies of the Algebra Cognitive Tutor found that the ITS students outperformed students taught by a classroom teacher on standardized test problems and real-world problem solving tasks. Subsequent studies found that these results were particularly pronounced in students from special education, non-native English, and low-income backgrounds.\n\nA more recent meta-analysis suggests that ITSs can exceed the effectiveness of both CAI and human tutors, especially when measured by local (specific) tests as opposed to standardized tests. \"Students who received intelligent tutoring outperformed students from conventional classes in 46 (or 92%) of the 50 controlled evaluations, and the improvement in performance was great enough to be considered of substantive importance in 39 (or 78%) of the 50 studies. The median ES in the 50 studies was 0.66, which is considered a moderate-to-large effect for studies in the social sciences. It is roughly equivalent to an improvement in test performance from the 50th to the 75th percentile. This is stronger than typical effects from other forms of tutoring. C.-L. C. Kulik and Kulik’s (1991) meta-analysis, for example, found an average ES of 0.31 in 165 studies of CAI tutoring. ITS gains are about twice as high. The ITS effect is also greater than typical effects from human tutoring. As we have seen, programs of human tutoring typically raise student test scores about 0.4 standard deviations over control levels. Developers of ITSs long ago set out to improve on the success of CAI tutoring and to match the success of human tutoring. Our results suggest that ITS developers have already met both of these goals... Although effects were moderate to strong in evaluations that measured outcomes on locally developed tests, they were much smaller in evaluations that measured outcomes on standardized tests. Average ES on studies with local tests was 0.73; average ES on studies with standardized tests was 0.13. This discrepancy is not unusual for meta-analyses that include both local and standardized tests... local tests are likely to align well with the objectives of specific instructional programs. Off-the-shelf standardized tests provide a looser fit. ... Our own belief is that both local and standardized tests provide important information about instructional effectiveness, and when possible, both types of tests should be included in evaluation studies.\"\n\nSome recognized strengths of ITS are their ability to provide immediate yes/no feedback, individual task selection, on-demand hints, and support mastery learning.\n\nIntelligent tutoring systems are expensive both to develop and implement. The research phase paves the way for the development of systems that are commercially viable. However, the research phase is often expensive; it requires the cooperation and input of subject matter experts, the cooperation and support of individuals across both organizations and organizational levels. Another limitation in the development phase is the conceptualization and the development of software within both budget and time constraints. There are also factors that limit the incorporation of intelligent tutors into the real world, including the long timeframe required for development and the high cost of the creation of the system components. A high portion of that cost is a result of content component building. For instance, surveys revealed that encoding an hour of online instruction time took 300 hours of development time for touring content. Similarly, building the Cognitive Tutor took a ratio of development time to instruction time of at least 200:1 hours. The high cost of development often eclipses replicating the efforts for real world application.\nIntelligent tutoring systems are not, in general, commercially feasible for real-world applications.\n\nA criticism of Intelligent Tutoring Systems currently in use, is the pedagogy of immediate feedback and hint sequences that are built in to make the system \"intelligent\". This pedagogy is criticized for its failure to develop deep learning in students. When students are given control over the ability to receive hints, the learning response created is negative. Some students immediately turn to the hints before attempting to solve the problem or complete the task. When it is possible to do so, some students bottom out the hints – receiving as many hints as possible as fast as possible – in order to complete the task faster. If students fail to reflect on the tutoring system's feedback or hints, and instead increase guessing until positive feedback is garnered, the student is, in effect, learning to do the right thing for the wrong reasons. Most tutoring systems are currently unable to detect shallow learning, or to distinguish between productive versus unproductive struggle (though see, e.g.,). For these and many other reasons (e.g., overfitting of underlying models to particular user populations), the effectiveness of these systems may differ significantly across users.\n\nAnother criticism of intelligent tutoring systems is the failure of the system to ask questions of the students to explain their actions. If the student is not learning the domain language than it becomes more difficult to gain a deeper understanding, to work collaboratively in groups, and to transfer the domain language to writing. For example, if the student is not \"talking science\" than it is argued that they are not being immersed in the culture of science, making it difficult to undertake scientific writing or participate in collaborative team efforts. Intelligent tutoring systems have been criticized for being too \"instructivist\" and removing intrinsic motivation, social learning contexts, and context realism from learning.\n\nPractical concerns, in terms of the inclination of the sponsors/authorities and the users to adapt intelligent tutoring systems, should be taken into account. First, someone must have a willingness to implement the ITS. Additionally an authority must recognize the necessity to integrate an intelligent tutoring software into current curriculum and finally, the sponsor or authority must offer the needed support through the stages of the system development until it is completed and implemented.\n\nEvaluation of an intelligent tutoring system is an important phase; however, it is often difficult, costly, and time consuming. Even though there are various evaluation techniques presented in the literature, there are no guiding principles for the selection of appropriate evaluation method(s) to be used in a particular context. Careful inspection should be undertaken to ensure that a complex system does what it claims to do. This assessment may occur during the design and early development of the system to identify problems and to guide modifications (i.e. formative evaluation). In contrast, the evaluation may occur after the completion of the system to support formal claims about the construction, behaviour of, or outcomes associated with a completed system (i.e. summative evaluation). The great challenge introduced by the lack of evaluation standards resulted in neglecting the evaluation stage in several existing ITS'.\n\nIntelligent tutoring systems are less capable than human tutors in the areas of dialogue and feedback. For example, human tutors are able to interpret the affective state of the student, and potentially adapt instruction in response to these perceptions. Recent work is exploring potential strategies for overcoming these limitations of ITSs, to make them more effective.\n\nDialogue\n\nHuman tutors have the ability to understand a person's tone and inflection within a dialogue and interpret this to provide continual feedback through an ongoing dialogue. Intelligent tutoring systems are now being developed to attempt to simulate natural conversations. To get the full experience of dialogue there are many different areas in which a computer must be programmed; including being able to understand tone, inflection, body language, and facial expression and then to respond to these. Dialogue in an ITS can be used to ask specific questions to help guide students and elicit information while allowing students to construct their own knowledge. The development of more sophisticated dialogue within an ITS has been a focus in some current research partially to address the limitations and create a more constructivist approach to ITS. In addition, some current research has focused on modeling the nature and effects of various social cues commonly employed within a dialogue by human tutors and tutees, in order to build trust and rapport (which have been shown to have positive impacts on student learning).\n\nEmotional affect\n\nA growing body of work is considering the role of affect on learning, with the objective of developing intelligent tutoring systems that can interpret and adapt to the different emotional states. Humans do not just use cognitive processes in learning but the affective processes they go through also plays an important role. For example, learners learn better when they have a certain level of disequilibrium (frustration), but not enough to make the learner feel completely overwhelmed. This has motivated affective computing to begin to produce and research creating intelligent tutoring systems that can interpret the affective process of an individual. An ITS can be developed to read an individual's expressions and other signs of affect in an attempt to find and tutor to the optimal affective state for learning. There are many complications in doing this since affect is not expressed in just one way but in multiple ways so that for an ITS to be effective in interpreting affective states it may require a multimodal approach (tone, facial expression, etc...). These ideas have created a new field within ITS, that of Affective Tutoring Systems (ATS). One example of an ITS that addresses affect is Gaze Tutor which was developed to track students eye movements and determine whether they are bored or distracted and then the system attempts to reengage the student.\n\nSeveral conferences regularly consider papers on intelligent tutoring systems. The oldest is \nThe International Conference on Intelligent Tutoring Systems, which started in 1988 and is now held every other year. The International Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) Society publishes The International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education (IJAIED) and organizes the annual International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (http://iaied.org/conf/1/) started in 1989. Many papers on intelligent tutoring systems also appear at International Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation, and Personalization () and International Conference on Educational Data Mining ().\nThe American Association of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) will sometimes have symposia and papers related to intelligent tutoring systems. A number of books have been written on ITS including three published by Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is sponsored by the Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society.\n\nIn 1976, the International Wittgenstein Symposium was founded by Elisabeth Leinfellner, Werner Leinfellner, Rudolf Haller, Paul Weingartner, and Adolf Hübner in Kirchberg am Wechsel, Lower Austria. The location was chosen because in the 1920s, Ludwig Wittgenstein taught at elementary schools in the area surrounding Kirchberg am Wechsel. On the 24th to the 25th of April, 1976 (just prior to the 25th anniversary of Wittgenstein's death), the first conference took place. Only four of the five founders gave talks on his philosophical work at the first meeting, but at the second, 120 speakers attended from around the world.\n\nThe general topic of each symposium centers around the philosophy and philosophy of science of Wittgenstein, but the specific topics change from year to year. For example, the topic of the second International Wittgenstein Symposium was \"Wittgenstein and his impact on contemporary thought\" and the topic of the third symposium was \"Wittgenstein, the Vienna Circle, and critical rationalism (including a seminar on Popper's \"open society\").\" A survey of topics is available from the site of the Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society.\n\nStarting with the second symposium, the papers accepted for presentation have been published in edited proceedings. From 1978 to 2005 the proceedings of the International Wittgenstein Symposium were published by Hölder-Pichler-Tempsky and are now published by ontos verlag. The proceedings published at ontos verlag are available Open Access online at a site prepared by the Wittgenstein Archives at the University of Bergen. The Wittgenstein Archives have also prepared a site that contains an Open Access selection of symposium papers from the period 2001-10.\n\nThe symposia are sponsored by the Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society and they are largely funded by the government of Lower Austria and the Austrian Federal Ministry for Science and Research.\n\n"}

{"id": "8942033", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8942033", "title": "Kathryn Merteuil", "text": "Kathryn Merteuil\n\nKathryn Merteuil is a fictional character who appears in \"Cruel Intentions\" and \"Cruel Intentions 2\", portrayed by actresses Sarah Michelle Gellar and Amy Adams, respectively. Based on the Marquise Isabelle de Merteuil in Pierre Choderlos de Laclos's \"Les Liaisons dangereuses\", Kathryn serves as the primary antagonist of the series.\n\nIn the film, Kathryn is wealthy, beautiful and popular, She is part of the Upper East Side's social elite. Portrayed as a manipulative mastermind who uses and destroys people for her own amusement, she is also depicted as being addicted to cocaine, which she hides in her rosary, and may even suffer from Bulimia, as her ex-boyfriend Court states she's a \"Bulimic Headcase\" and Sebastian's private journal also states she's bulimic. She hides her true nature behind the facade of a deeply religious model student, fooling everyone she knows, except for her equally narcissistic step-brother Sebastian Valmont and Court Reynolds. Kathryn shows signs of sociopathic and narcissistic traits, treating the death of her supposedly \"loved\" brother with cold disdain (who exposed her, posthumously, via his journal, a book that Cecile and Annette distributed), and gleefully enjoying destroying his life, as well as those of the people she perceives as threats or inferior to her. She has a strong superiority complex, but the extent of her interest in Sebastian is left ambiguous (she does cry when Sebastian's journal is made public, but whether this is because she finally saw how much Sebastian actually loathed/loved her, or if it is because people finally see her conniving, troubled mind, is left unanswered). Kathryn is the archetypal cold, ice princess whose opulent bedroom is a cold, dark lair decorated in royal blue and silver with crystal embellishments. When she's not wearing black, gray or other dark, muted colors, she occasionally wears icy blue.\n\nIn the film, she's first seen discussing her prep school with Mrs. Caldwell and her daughter, Cecile. Kathryn promises Mrs. Caldwell that she will look out for the sheltered and naive Cecile. However, she reveals to her step-brother Sebastian that her real intention is to use Cecile to take revenge on Court Reynolds, her ex-boyfriend, who had dumped her for Cecile. Kathryn asks Sebastian to seduce Cecile; yet he refuses as he is planning to seduce virgin Annette Hargrove, the daughter of their school's new headmaster. The two make a wager: Kathryn believes he cannot get Annette to bed, yet Sebastian believes he can. If Kathryn wins, she gets Sebastian's vintage Jaguar XK140; if Sebastian wins, Kathryn will have sex with him.\n\nAfter numerous failed attempts of seducing Annette, Sebastian agrees to seduce Cecile. Cecile confesses to Kathryn that her music teacher, Ronald Clifford is in love with her. Afterwards Kathryn secretly tells Mrs. Caldwell about Ronald and Cecile's romance and Mrs. Caldwell intervenes in their relationship. Sebastian, in turn, calls Cecile to his house, ostensibly to give her a letter from Ronald. There, he blackmails Cecile and performs oral sex on her. The next day, Cecile confides in Kathryn, who advises her to learn from Sebastian so that she can make Ronald happy in bed.\n\nAfter Sebastian sleeps with Annette, Kathryn offers herself to Sebastian as he has won the bet, but he refuses; he now only wants Annette. Kathryn begins showing signs of possessiveness towards Sebastian, and it is suggested that she is in truly in love with him. The next day, Kathryn taunts him and threatens to ruin Annette's reputation, so Sebastian pretends indifference to Annette and coldly breaks up with her. After Sebastian tells Kathryn that he has broken up with Annette and arranged for Cecile and Ronald to be together, Kathryn reveals that she has known all along that he was truly in love with Annette and manipulated him into giving her up. Kathryn knowing he came to make plans for them to have sex, rejects him. Once he leaves Kathryn calls Ronald to tell him that Sebastian slept with Cecile and (falsely) inform him that Sebastian hit her. This false information leads to Ronald attacking Sebastian and engineers his death. Only when he watches Sebastian and Annette profess their love before his death, Ronald realizes that Kathryn lied to him in order to get him to kill Sebastian and feels guilty for his actions. At Sebastian's funeral, Cecile distributes copies of Sebastian's private journal, made into a book by Annette, titled \"Cruel Intentions\". Kathryn is humiliated and rejected by her former friends, and her spotless reputation is ruined when the drugs hidden in her rosary are discovered.\n\nThe straight-to-video prequel to the original film centers around a younger Kathryn. In the prequel film it is revealed Kathryn was born to Manhattan's Tiffany Merteuil a well-respected New York socialite. However, the prequel features several inconsistencies in its relation to the first film, such as the backstory concerning Kathryn's mother and Kathryn's overly outward meanspirited behavior, but this is due to the film originally being written as a TV series retelling rather than a prequel. She attends Manchester Prep, a prestigious co-educational private school on just outside of the city. As in the first film, she manipulates and controls everyone around her, even seducing her school's headmaster, and then blackmailing him into letting her do whatever she wants. Soon her new Step-brother Sebastian Valmont and his father move in, and after their first meeting, Kathryn becomes quickly jealous of Sebastian as he out skills her in both piano and vocabulary.\n\nThe next day, at a school assembly, Kathryn, who is the student body president, delivers a speech to her classmates, but is interrupted by uncontrollable hiccups coming from a student, who then begins to choke on the gum that she was chewing in a bid to stop her hiccups. She is saved by the quick action of Another fellow student who performs the Heimlich maneuver, allowing the student to expel the gum, which ends up flying into Kathryn's hair. Afterwards Kathryn calls a meeting For the secret society of student elites, deciding upon the fate of the new students. This leads them to Cherie, the student with the hiccups, as well as the discovery that Cherie's family is wealthier than that of Kathryn; this, and the events of the assembly, cause Kathryn to seek a vendetta against Cherie.\n\nThe next night, Kathryn calls Cherie, asking if she'd like to attend a school event with her. Revealing to Sebastian that she plans to ruin Cherie's reputation. She takes Cherie to a popular nightclub, and tricks her into drinking several Long Island Ice Teas. After getting the attention of a male club goer, Kathryn tells Cherie he clearly likes her and that she has to \"fuck him\". Yet her plan fails once Cherie throws up on the young man's feet. After Sebastian angers Kathryn, whose day is interrupted by not being able to contact her driver, She conducts a plan to make him similar to her, and begins thinking on how she can mold Sebastian into a heartless womanizer. She starts by interfering with Sebastian's attempts to woo the fellow student Danielle. Kathryn first tries to tempt him away from Danielle by luring him with identical twins, who confide to Sebastian that Danielle is the only virgin at Manchester and she plans not to have sex with anyone unless she's truly in love.\n\nKathryn continues her attempt to sabotage Cherie, however it backfires, as Kathryn's mother tells her to become best friends with Cherie, in an attempt to encourage Cherie's mother to donate a large amount of money to the school. Sebastian soon professes his love for Danielle, only to find that she does not reciprocate. It turns out that Danielle is actually secretly working alongside Kathryn and is helping fulfill her secret plan to dupe Sebastian and make him heartless. Defeated by Kathryn's manipulation, a heartbroken Sebastian states he no longer has any attentions to ever fall in love again, afterwards he makes an alliance with Kathryn to dominate and manipulate others. She then tells Sebastian he should start with Cherie.\n\nWhile Kathryn herself does not appear in the third film in the franchise, the main character in this film - Kathryn's equally manipulative cousin Cassidy Merteuil - reveals that she is currently a patient in a methadone clinic.\n\nKathleen Sweeney sees Merteuil as one of \"Hollywood's Bad Girls\", a stock character that Sweeney regards as appearing first in Veronica Sawyer in the 1988 film \"Heathers\". Sweeney suggests that 1999 \"gave viewers two manipulative dark-haired Queen Bees\": Kathryn Merteuil in \"Cruel Intentions\" and Courtney Alice Shayne in \"Jawbreaker\". Sweeney notes that in both films, \"the Queens of Mean are punished by their peers, but not before laying out the game plan for wielding power in high school as visual \"how-to\" manuals for aspiring Queen Bees everywhere.\" Merteuil, Sweeney suggests, \"maintains a Straight-A Uber Girl persona of innocence until the very end.\" Samantha Lindop classifies Merteuil as a \"fille fatale\" (a young \"femme fatale\") and compares her to Adrian Forrester in \"The Crush\".\n\nRichard Burt suggests that Merteuil is \"punished for being beautiful and smart\" in that she \"can't keep guys from dumping her for stupider girls.\" Burt goes on to note that Merteuil is a \"bitch\" who is \"incapable of love\" and \"ultimately humiliated for her destructive nastiness.\"\n\nGellar's portrayal of Merteuil was parodied in the 2001 film \"Not Another Teen Movie\", in which Mia Kirshner played Catherine Wyler, \"The Cruelest Girl in School\".\n"}

{"id": "33174651", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33174651", "title": "La Cebra Danza Gay", "text": "La Cebra Danza Gay\n\nLa Cebra Danza Gay is a dance troupe founded in 1996 by José Rivera Moya in Mexico City. It is the first in Mexico to focus nearly exclusively on gay community and the issues it faces. The groups as a repertoire of over ten major works including \"Danza del mal amor o mejor me voy\", which has been performed over 100 times. La Cebra has appeared in various locations in Mexico and has had appearances in the United States and France.\nThe dance troupe was founded by José Rivera Moya from San Luis Potosí. When Rivera arrived to Mexico City in 1987, there were no gay bars and police action against homosexuals was common. In the capital, Rivera became a dancer with the Ballet Independiente under director Raúl Flores Canelo, who would remain an influence on Rivera’s work since. While a dancer with this Ballet, Rivera produced his first work with a homoerotic theme called \"Danza del mal amor o mejor me voy\", first presented in 1990, winning the Concurso Interno de Coreografías of that year. In 1996, Rivera founded La Cebra in Mexico City to focus nearly exclusively on gay themes, becoming his life’s work. \n\nRivera readily admits he is not the first choreographer in Mexico to create gay-themed pieces, giving credit to his mentor Flores Canelo as well as to Marco Antonio Silva and Miguel Mancillas. However, he founded La Cebra as the first to focus on gay themes, with much of the works presented by the group based on Rivera’s own life as a gay male growing up in Mexican society.The director considers himself a “narrative choreographer” and says that his works say what many young gays “want to scream.” Today, Rivera remains artistic director of the Ballet Independiente and has become a member of the Mexican Society of Choreographers (Sociedad Mexicana de Coreógrafos).\nLa Cebra Danza Gay was established in 1996 specifically to focus on gay issues, including erotic themes. Rivera’s 1990s work, \"Danza del mal amor o mejor me voy\", moved from the Ballet Independiente to become one of the main elements of the new organization’s repertoire. In 1998, the group had it first major performance at the XXIII Festival Internacional de Danza “Lilia López” in San Luis Potosí. Since then it has remained active, performing in various parts of Mexico and the United States. As of 2005, Danza del mal amor o mejor me voy had been performed 100 times. In 2010, it collaborated with humorist Alejandro García Villalón of the Nueva Trova Cubana. Today, there are six main dancers José Rivera Moya, Bruno Ramírez, Hugo Cruz, Jonathan Villeda, Juan Madero and Jesús Salinas. It is one of very few dance troupes consisting entirely of men, as most are dominated by women.The members of the group are not necessarily homosexual, but the themes it works with almost exclusively are. La Cebra has had guest choreographers such as Rafael Rosales, also from the Ballet Independiente, and Bruno Ramírez. The group receives support from the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes, with permanent practice space at the CONACULTA building in Colonia Guerrero in Mexico City. For its 15th anniversary, the troupe performed “Con humo en los ojos y en el corazón” by Uruguayan dancer Dery Fazio. The event also included a “retro” fashion show to support AIDS research. \nLa Cebra’s message and focus remains on the gay community and the issues it faces with some branching out to more general cultural and human rights issues. These include elements such as homoeroticism, violence, minority rights, AIDS, cross-dressing, hate crimes, discrimination, male prostitution and the Catholic’s church stance on homosexuality. \n\n\"Ave María Purísima, de prostitución y lentejuelas\" was created with the dance company in 1996. \"Yo no soy Pancho Villa ni me gusta el futbol\" was created in 1998 about the gay nightclub scene in Mexico City. \"Quinceañera del Bajío mata a sus chambelanes\" is a criticism of the drug-related violence which plagues Mexico. \"Oraciones\" was choreographed by Graciela Henriquez, which traces the roots of Latin American peoples and the religious syncretism that emerged after Spanish and Portuguese conquests. \"Arcoiris Mambo\" is a homage to the music of the 1950s, and the movies of Mexico’s Golden Age of Cinema. \"Bailemos a Mozart. Por los ángeles que se han ido\" was created in 2001 in memory of those who had died of AIDS. \"El tiempo lo arrasa todo. Queda la muerte\" was created in 2004 which discusses death and AIDS. \"Cartas de amor\" is about people who live with HIV. \"El soldado y el marinero\" is a love story.\nLa Cebra has performed in various parts of Mexico, such as Baja California, Colima and Oaxaca and has made appearances in the United States and Europe. The group performed \"Bailemos a Mozart, por los angeles\" at the Palacio de Bellas Artes, the country’s most prestigious venue. The group represented Mexico at the X Biennal de la Danse in Lyon, France in 2002. It participated in the X Muestra Internacional de Danza Tijuana in 2008. In 2010, performed at the Feria del Libro y la Rosa in Taxco, sponsored by UNAM, and the Festival Artístico Coahuila . In 2011, they were invited to perform at the Festival Internacional Cervantino, which is significant as Guanajuato is considered one of the most conservative cities in Mexico. For this event, the group opted to perform a work called \"Ganímedes\",” which is based on the Greek myth. It has homoerotic themes and dances who are nude except for body paint.\n"}

{"id": "15754385", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15754385", "title": "Noble lie", "text": "Noble lie\n\nIn politics, a noble lie is a myth or untruth, often, but not invariably, of a religious nature, knowingly propagated by an elite to maintain social harmony or to advance an agenda. The noble lie is a concept originated by Plato as described in the \"Republic\".\n\nIn religion, a pious fiction is a narrative that is presented as true by the author, but is considered by others to be fictional albeit produced with an altruistic motivation. The term is sometimes used pejoratively to suggest that the author of the narrative was deliberately misleading readers for selfish or deceitful reasons. The term is often used in religious contexts, sometimes referring to passages in religious texts.\n\nPlato presented the Noble Lie (γενναῖον ψεῦδος, \"gennaion pseudos\" – literally, \"a lie or wrong opinion about origin\") in the fictional tale known as the myth or parable of the metals. In it, Socrates provides the origin of the three social classes who compose the republic proposed by Plato; Socrates speaks of a socially stratified society, wherein the populace are told \"a sort of Phoenician tale\":\n\nSocrates proposes and claims that if the people believed \"this myth...[it] would have a good effect, making them more inclined to care for the state and one another.\" This is his \"noble lie\": \"a contrivance for one of those falsehoods that come into being in case of need, of which we were just now talking, some noble one...\"\n\nKarl Popper accused Plato of trying to base religion on a noble lie as well. In \"The Open Society and Its Enemies\", Popper remarks, \"It is hard to understand why those of Plato's commentators who praise him for fighting against the subversive conventionalism of the Sophists, and for establishing a spiritual naturalism ultimately based on religion, fail to censure him for making a convention, or rather an invention, the ultimate basis of religion.\" Religion for Plato is a noble lie, at least if we assume that Plato meant all of this sincerely, not cynically. Popper finds Plato's conception of religion to have been very influential in subsequent thought.\n\nStrauss noted that thinkers of the first rank, going back to Plato, had raised the problem of whether good and effective politicians could be completely truthful and still achieve the necessary ends of their society. By implication, Strauss asks his readers to consider whether it is true that noble lies have no role at all to play in uniting and guiding the polis. Are myths needed to give people meaning and purpose and to ensure a stable society? Or can men dedicated to relentlessly examining, in Nietzsche's language, those \"deadly truths,\" flourish freely? Thus, is there a limit to the political, and what can be known absolutely? In \"The City and Man,\" Strauss discusses the myths outlined in Plato's \"Republic\" that are required for all governments. These include a belief that the state's land belongs to it even though it was likely acquired illegitimately and that citizenship is rooted in something more than the accidents of birth. Seymour Hersh also claims that Strauss endorsed noble lies: myths used by political leaders seeking to maintain a cohesive society. In \"The Power of Nightmares\", documentary filmmaker Adam Curtis opines that \"Strauss believed it was for politicians to assert powerful and inspiring myths that everyone could believe in. They might not be true, but they were necessary illusions. One of these was religion; the other was the myth of the nation.\"\n\n\"Plato has been criticized for his Foundation Myth as if it were a calculated lie. That is partly because the phrase here translated 'magnificent myth' (p.414b) has been conventionally mistranslated 'noble lie'; and this has been used to support the charge that Plato countenances manipulation by propaganda. But the myth is accepted by all three classes, Guardians included. It is meant to replace the national traditions which any community has, which are intended to express the kind of community it is, or wishes to be, its ideals, rather than to state matters of fact.\"\n\nThe Sea of Faith Network (SoF) aims are \"Exploring and promoting religious faith as a human creation...\"\n\nAlthough arguably not an organisation \"based\" on the noble lie, many of their members no longer believe, but continue to espouse religious beliefs for positive social control and continue to hold positions in many religious organizations and various church groups.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14775345", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14775345", "title": "Nude (art)", "text": "Nude (art)\n\nThe nude figure is a tradition in Western art, and has been used to express ideals of male and female beauty and other human qualities. It was a central preoccupation of Ancient Greek art, and after a semi-dormant period in the Middle Ages returned to a central position in Western art with the Renaissance. Athletes, dancers, and warriors are depicted to express human energy and life, and nudes in various poses may express basic or complex emotions such as pathos. In one sense, a nude is a work of fine art that has as its primary subject the unclothed human body, forming a subject genre of art, in the same way as landscapes and still life. Unclothed figures often also play a part in other types of art, such as history painting, including allegorical and religious art, portraiture, or the decorative arts.\n\nNude female figures called Venus figurines are found in very early prehistoric art, and in historical times, similar images represent fertility deities. Representations of gods and goddesses in Babylonian and Ancient Egyptian art are the precursors of the works of Western antiquity. Other significant non-Western traditions of depicting nudes come from India, and Japan, but the nude does not form an important aspect of Chinese art. Temple sculptures and cave paintings, some very explicit, are part of the Hindu tradition of the value of sexuality, and as in many warm climates partial or complete nudity was common in everyday life. Japan had a tradition of mixed communal bathing that existed until recently, and was often portrayed in woodcut prints.\n\nThe earliest Greek sculpture, from the early Bronze Age Cycladic civilization consists mainly of stylized male figures who are presumably nude. This is certainly the case for the kouros, a large standing figure of a male nude that was the mainstay of Archaic Greek sculpture. The first realistic sculptures of nude males, the kouroi depict nude youths who stand rigidly posed with one foot forward. By the 5th century BCE, Greek sculptors' mastery of anatomy resulted in greater naturalness and more varied poses. An important innovation was contrapposto—the asymmetrical posture of a figure standing with one leg bearing the body's weight and the other relaxed. An early example of this is Polykleitos' sculpture \"Doryphoros\" (ca. 440 BCE).\n\nIn the convention of heroic nudity, gods and heroes were shown nude, while ordinary mortals were less likely to be so, though athletes and warriors in combat were often depicted nude.\n\nIn Ancient Greece, where the mild climate was conducive to being lightly-clothed or nude whenever convenient, and male athletes competed at religious festivals entirely nude, and celebrated the human body, it was perfectly natural for the Greeks to associate the male nude form with triumph, glory, and even moral excellence. The Greek goddess Aphrodite was a deity whom the Greeks preferred to see clothed. In the mid-fourth century BC, the sculptor Praxiteles made a nude Aphrodite, called the Knidian, which established a new tradition for the female nude, having idealized proportions based on mathematical ratios as were the nude male statues. The nudes of Greco-Roman art are conceptually perfected ideal persons, each one a vision of health, youth, geometric clarity, and organic equilibrium. Kenneth Clark considered idealization the hallmark of true nudes, as opposed to more descriptive and less artful figures that he considered merely naked. His emphasis on idealization points up an essential issue: seductive and appealing as nudes in art may be, they are meant to stir the mind as well as the passions.\n\nChristian attitudes cast doubt on the value of the human body, and the Christian emphasis on chastity and celibacy further discouraged depictions of nakedness, even in the few surviving Early Medieval survivals of secular art. Completely unclothed figures are rare in medieval art, the notable exceptions being Adam and Eve and the damned in \"Last Judgement\" scenes, and the ideal forms of Greco-Roman nudes are completely lost, transformed into symbols of shame and sin, weakness and defenselessness. This was true not only in Western Europe, but also in Byzantine art. Increasingly, Christ was shown largely naked in scenes of his Passion, especially the Crucifixion, and even when glorified in heaven, to allow him to display the wounds his sufferings had involved. The Nursing Madonna and naked \"Penitent Mary Magdalene\", as well as the infant Jesus, whose penis was sometimes emphasized for theological reasons, are other exceptions with elements of nudity in medieval religious art.\n\nBy the late medieval period female nudes intended to be attractive edged back into art, especially in the relatively private medium of the illuminated manuscript, and in classical contexts such as the Signs of the Zodiac and illustrations to Ovid. The shape of the female \"Gothic nude\" was very different from the classical ideal, with a long body shaped by gentle curves, a narrow chest and high waist, small round breasts, and a prominent bulge at the stomach (as in the Hugo van der Goes at left). Male nudes tended to be slim and slight in figure, probably drawing on apprentices used as models, but were increasingly accurately observed.\n\nThe rediscovery of classical culture in the Renaissance restored the nude to art. Donatello made two statues of the Biblical hero David, a symbol for the Republic of Florence: his first (in marble, 1408–1409) shows a clothed figure, but his second, probably of the 1440s, is the first freestanding statue of a nude since antiquity, several decades before Michelangelo's massive \"David\" (1501–04). Nudes in Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling reestablished a tradition of male nudes in depictions of Biblical stories; the subject of the martyrdom of the near-naked Saint Sebastian had already become highly popular. The monumental female nude returned to Western art in 1486 with \"The Birth of Venus\" by Sandro Botticelli for the Medici family, who also owned the classical Venus de' Medici, whose pose Botticelli adapted.\n\nThe \"Dresden Venus\" of Giorgione (c. 1510), also drawing on classical models, showed a reclining female nude in a landscape, beginning a long line of famous paintings including the \"Venus of Urbino\" (Titian, 1538), the \"Rokeby Venus\" (Diego Velázquez, c. 1650), Goya's \"Nude Maja\" (c. 1798) and Manet's \"Olympia\" (1863). Although they reflect the proportions of ancient statuary, such figures as Titian's \"Venus and the Lute Player\" and \"Venus of Urbino\" highlight the sexuality of the female body rather than its ideal geometry. In addition to adult male and female figures, the classical depiction of Eros became the model for the naked Christ child.\n\nRaphael in his later years is usually credited as the first artist to consistently use female models for the drawings of female figures, rather than studio apprentices or other boys with breasts added, who were previously used. Michelangelo's suspiciously boyish \"Study of a Kneeling Nude Girl for The Entombment\" (Louvre, c. 1500), which is usually said to be the first nude female figure study, predates this and is an example of how even figures who would be shown clothed in the final work were often worked out in nude studies, so that the form under the clothing was understood. The nude figure drawing or figure study of a live model rapidly became an important part of artistic practice and training, and remained so until the 20th century.\n\nIn Baroque art, the continuing fascination with classical antiquity influenced artists to renew their approach to the nude, but with more naturalistic, less idealized depictions, perhaps more frequently working from live models. Both genders are represented; the male in the form of heroes such as Hercules and Samson, and female in the form of Venus and the Three Graces. Peter Paul Rubens, who with evident delight painted women of generous figure and radiant flesh, gave his name to the adjective rubenesque.\n\nIn the later Baroque or Rococo period, a more decorative and playful style emerged, exemplified by François Boucher's \"Venus Consoling Love\", likely commissioned by Madame Pompadour.\n\nIn the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, classical subjects remained popular, along with nudes in historical paintings. In the later nineteenth century, academic painters continued with classical themes, but were challenged by the Impressionists. Eduard Manet shocked the public of his time by painting nude women in contemporary situations in his \"Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe\" (1863) and \"Olympia\" (1865), and Gustave Courbet earned criticism for portraying in his \"Woman with a Parrot\" a naked prostitute without vestige of goddess or nymph. Edgar Degas painted many nudes of women in ordinary circumstances, such as taking a bath. Auguste Rodin challenged classical canons of idealization in his expressively distorted Adam. With the invention of photography, artists began using the new medium as a source for paintings, Eugène Delacroix being one of the first.\n\nAlthough both the Academic tradition and Impressionists lost their cultural supremacy at the beginning of the twentieth century, the nude remained although transformed by the ideas of modernism. The idealized Venus was replaced by the woman intimately depicted in private settings, as in the work of Egon Schiele. The simplified modern forms of Jean Metzinger, Amedeo Modigliani, Gaston Lachaise and Aristide Maillol recall the original goddesses of fertility more than Greek goddesses. In early abstract paintings, the body could be fragmented or dismembered, as in Picasso's Demoiselles d'Avignon, but there are also abstracted versions of classical themes, such as Henri Matisse's dancers and bathers.\n\nIn the post-WWII era, Abstract Expressionism moved the center of Western art from Paris to New York City. One of the primary influences in the rise of abstraction, the critic Clement Greenberg, had supported de Kooning's early abstract work. Despite Greenberg's advice, the artist, who had begun as a figurative painter, returned to the human form in early 1950 with his \"Woman\" series. Although having some references to the traditions of single female figures, the women were portrayed as voracious, distorted, and semi-abstract. According to the artist, he wanted to \"create the angry humor of tragedy\"; having the frantic look of the atomic age, a world in turmoil, a world in need of comic relief. Later, he said \"Maybe ... I was painting the woman in me. Art isn't a wholly masculine occupation, you know. I'm aware that some critics would take this to be an admission of latent homosexuality ... If I painted beautiful women, would that make me a non-homosexual? I like beautiful women. In the flesh—even the models in magazines. Women irritate me sometimes. I painted that irritation in the Woman series. That's all.\" Such ideas could not be expressed by pure abstraction alone. Some critics, however, see the Woman series as misogynistic.\n\nOther New York artists of this period retained the figure as their primary subject. Alice Neel painted nudes, including her own self-portrait, in the same straightforward style as clothed sitters, being primarily concerned with color and emotional content. Philip Pearlstein uses unique cropping and perspective to explore the abstract qualities of nudes. As a young artist in the 1950s, Pearlstein exhibited both abstracts and figures, but it was deKooning that advised him to continue with figurative work.\n\nAround 1970, from feminist principles, Sylvia Sleigh painted a series of works reversing stereotypical artistic themes by featuring naked men in poses usually associated with women.\n\nLucien Freud was one of a small group of painters which included Francis Bacon who came to be known as \"The School of London\"; creating figurative work in the 1970s when it was unfashionable. However, by the end of his life his works had become icons of the Post Modern era, depicting the human body without a trace of idealization, as in his series working with an obese model. One of Freud's works is entitled \"Naked Portrait\", which implies a realistic image of a particular unclothed woman rather than a conventional nude. In Freud's obituary in \"The New York Times\", it is stated: His \"stark and revealing paintings of friends and intimates, splayed nude in his studio, recast the art of portraiture and offered a new approach to figurative art\".\n\nThe paintings of Jenny Saville include family and self-portraits among other nudes; often done in extreme perspectives, attempting to balance realism with abstraction; all while expressing how a woman feels about the female nude. Lisa Yuskavage's nude figures painted in a nearly academic manner constitute a \"parody of art historical nudity and the male obsession with the female form as object\". John Currin is another painter whose work frequently reinterprets historic nudes. Cecily Brown's paintings combine figurative elements and abstraction in a style reminiscent of de Kooning. Marlene Dumas paints emotionally challenging images derived from her own snapshots or from photographs found in news magazines. Dumas says of her paintings of nude figures that \"it was not the nude I was looking for, nor the posing figure, but the erotic conditions of life ... Two 'subjects' confronting each other.\"\n\nThe end of the twentieth century saw the rise of new media and approaches to art, although they began much earlier. In particular installation art often includes images of the human body, and performance art frequently includes nudity. \"Cut Piece\" by Yoko Ono was first performed in 1964 (then known as a \"happening\"). Audience members were requested to come on stage and begin cutting away her clothing until she was naked. Several contemporary performance artists such as Marina Abramović, Vanessa Beecroft and Carolee Schneemann use their own nude bodies or other performers in their work.\n\nIn art, a figure drawing is a study of the human form in its various shapes and body postures, with line, form, and composition as the primary objective, rather than the subject person. \nA life drawing is a work that has been drawn from an observation of a live model. Study of the human figure has traditionally been considered the best way to learning how to draw, beginning in the late Renaissance and continuing to the present.\n\nJapanese prints are one of the few non-western traditions that can be called nudes, but they are quite different. The activity of communal bathing in Japan is portrayed as just another social activity, without the significance placed upon the lack of clothing that exists in the West.\n\nOil paint historically has been the ideal medium for depicting the nude. By blending and layering paint, the surface can become more like skin. \"Its slow drying time and various degrees of viscosity enable the artist to achieve rich and subtle blends of color and texture, which can suggest transformations from one human substance to another.\"\n\nDue to its durability, it is in sculpture that we see the full, nearly unbroken history of the nude from the Stone Age to the present. Figures, usually of the naked female, have been found in the Balkan region dating back to 7,000 BCE and continue to this day to be generated. In the Indian and Southeast Asian sculpture tradition nudes were frequently adorned with bracelets and jewelry that tended to \"punctuate their charms and demarcate the different parts of their bodies much as developed musculature does in the male.\"\n\nThe nude has been a subject of photography almost since its invention in the nineteenth century. Early photographers often selected poses that imitated the classical nudes of the past. Photography suffers from the problem of being too real, and for many years was not accepted by those committed to the traditional fine arts. However, the work of many photographers has been established as fine artists including Ruth Bernhard, Imogen Cunningham, Anne Brigman, Edward Weston and Alfred Stieglitz.\n\nIn the late twentieth century several new art forms have emerged, including installations, performance, and video art all of which have been used to create works that include nudity.\n\nWhile there is no single definition of fine art, there are certain generally accepted features of most definitions. In the fine arts, the subject is not merely copied from nature, but transformed by the artist into an aesthetic object, usually without significant utilitarian, commercial (advertising, illustration), or purely decorative purposes. There is also a judgement of taste; the fine art nude being part of high culture rather than middle brow or low culture. However, judgements of taste in art are not entirely subjective, but include criteria of skill and craftsmanship in the creation of objects, communication of complex and non-trivial messages, and creativity. Some works accepted as high culture of the past, including much Academic art, are now seen as imitative or sentimental otherwise known as kitsch.\n\nModern artists have continued to explore classical themes, but also more abstract representations, and movement away from idealization to depict people more individually. During most of the twentieth century, the depiction of human beauty was of little interest to modernists, who were concerned instead with the creation of beauty through formal means. In the contemporary, or Post-modern era, the nude may be seen as passé by many, however there are always artists that continue to find inspiration in the human form.\n\nThe most often cited book on the nude in art history is \"The Nude: a Study in Ideal Form\" by Lord Kenneth Clark, first published in 1956. The introductory chapter makes the most often-quoted distinction between the naked body and the nude. Clark states that to be naked is to be deprived of clothes, and implies embarrassment and shame, while a nude, as a work of art, has no such connotations. This separation of the artistic form from the social and cultural issues remains largely unexamined by classical art historians.\n\nOne of the defining characteristics of the modern era in art is the blurring of the line between the naked and the nude. This likely first occurred with the painting \"The Nude Maya\" (1797) by Goya, which in 1815 drew the attention of the Spanish Inquisition.\nThe shocking elements were that it showed a particular model in a contemporary setting, with pubic hair rather than the smooth perfection of goddesses and nymphs, who returned the gaze of the viewer rather than looking away. (Goya then painted another version, with clothes.) Some of the same characteristics were shocking almost 70 years later when Manet exhibited his \"Olympia\", not because of religious issues, but because of its modernity. Rather than being a timeless Odalisque that could be safely viewed with detachment, Manet's image was of a prostitute of that time, perhaps referencing the male viewers' own sexual practices.\n\nArt historian and author, Frances Borzello says that contemporary artists are no longer interested in the ideals and traditions of the past, but confront the viewer with all the sexuality, discomfort and anxiety that the unclothed body may express, perhaps eliminating the distinction between the naked and the nude. Performance art takes the final step by presenting actual naked bodies as a work of art.\nKenneth Clark noted that sexuality was part of the attraction to the nude as a subject of art, stating \"no nude, however abstract, should fail to arouse in the spectator some vestige of erotic feeling, even though it be only the faintest shadow—and if it does not do so it is bad art and false morals.\" According to Clark, the explicit temple sculptures of tenth-century India \"are great works of art because their eroticism is part of their whole philosophy.\" Great art can contain significant sexual content without being obscene. However sexually explicit works of fine art produced in Europe before the modern era, such as Gustav Courbet's \"L'Origine du monde\", were not intended for public display. The judgement of whether a particular work is artistic or pornographic is ultimately subjective and has changed through history and from one culture to another. Some individuals judge any public display of the unclothed body to be unacceptable, while others may find artistic merit in explicitly sexual images. Public reviews of art may or may not address the issue.\n\nThe nude, particularly the female body, has always been one of the more obvious subjects of work in museums. However, in the United States nudity in art is a controversial subject when public funding and display in certain venues brings the work to the attention of the general public. Puritan history continues to impact the selection of artwork shown in museums and galleries. At the same time that any nude may be suspect in the view of many patrons and the public, art critics may reject work that is not either ironic or fetishistic, and therefore cutting edge. \"Artists who refuse to assault the body with stylishly perverse psychological or physical deformations are usually dismissed as being hopelessly out of tune with today's art world.\" Works that celebrate the human body are likely to be seen as too erotic by one group, and kitsch by the other. According to Bram Dijkstra, attractive nudes by American artists have been relegated to storage by museums, with only rare special exhibits or publications in recent decades. Relatively tame nudes tend to be shown in museums, while works with shock value such as those by Jeff Koons are shown in cutting-edge galleries. Dijkstra says the art world has devalued simple beauty and pleasure, although these values are present in art from the past and in many contemporary works.\n\nWhen school groups visit museums, there are inevitable questions that teachers or tour leaders must be prepared to answer. The basic advice is to give matter-of-fact answers emphasizing the differences between art and other images, the universality of the human body, and the values and emotions expressed in the works. However, the problems that might arise lead many teachers to avoid the subject.\n\nIn classical works, children were rarely shown except for babies and putti. Before the era of Freudian psychoanalysis, children were assumed to have no sexual feelings before puberty, so naked children were shown as symbols of pure innocence. Boys often swam nude, and were shown doing so in paintings by John Singer Sargent, George Bellows, and others. Other images were more erotic, either symbolically or explicitly.\n\nMen and women did not receive equal opportunities in nude training during the Renaissance. Female artists were not allowed access to nude models and could not participate in this part of the arts education. During this time period the study of the nude figure was something all male artists were expected to go through to become an artist of worth and to be able to create History Paintings.\n\nAcademic art history tends to ignore the sexuality of the male nude, speaking instead of form and composition.\n\nFor much of history, nude men represented martyrs and warriors, emphasizing an active role rather than the passive one assigned to women in art. Alice Neel and Lucien Freud painted the modern male nude in the classic reclining pose, with the genitals prominently displayed. Sylvia Sleigh painted versions of classic works with the genders reversed.\n\nThe Greek goddesses were initially sculpted with drapery rather than nude. The first free-standing, life-sized sculpture of an entirely nude woman was the \"Aphrodite of Cnidus\" created ca. 360–340 BCE by Praxiteles. The female nude became much more common in the later Hellenistic period.\n\nRarely seen during the Middle Ages, the female nude reappeared in Italy in the 15th century. Subsequently, eroticism became more emphatic in paintings such as Giorgione's \"Sleeping Venus\" (ca. 1510), which situated the reclining nude in an idyllic landscape, and Titian's \"Danaë\" series (ca. 1553–1556). These works inspired countless reclining female nudes for centuries afterwards. The annual glut of paintings of idealized nude women in the 19th-century Paris Salon was satirized by Honoré Daumier in an 1864 lithograph.\n\nIn the 19th century the Orientalism movement added another reclining female nude to the possible subjects of European paintings, the odalisque, a slave or harem girl. One of the most famous was \"The Grande Odalisque\" painted by Ingres in 1814.\n\nFor Lynda Nead, the female nude is a matter of containing sexuality; in the case of the classical art history view represented by Kenneth Clark, this is about idealization and de-emphasis of overt sexuality, while the modern view recognizes that the human body is messy, unbounded, and problematical. If a virtuous woman is dependent and weak, as was assumed by the images in classical art, then a strong, independent woman could not be portrayed as virtuous.\n\nUntil the 1960s, art history and criticism rarely reflected anything other than the male point of view. The feminist art movement began to change this, but one of the first widely known statements of the political messages in nudity was made in 1972 by the art critic John Berger. In \"Ways of Seeing\", he argued that female nudes reflected and reinforced the prevailing power relationship between females portrayed in art and the predominantly male audience. A year later Laura Mulvey wrote \"Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema\" stating the concept of the male gaze, which asserts that all nudes are inherently voyeuristic.\n\nThe feminist art movement was aimed at giving women the opportunity to have their art reach the same level of notoriety and respect that men’s art received. The idea that women are intellectually inferior to men came from Aristotelian ideology and was heavily depended on during the Renaissance. It was believed by Aristotle that during the process of procreation, men were the driving force. They held all creative power while women were the receivers. Women’s only role in reproduction was to provide the material and act as a vessel. This idea carried over into the image of the artist and the nude in art. The artist was seen specifically as a white male, and he was the only one who held the innate talent and creativity to be a successful professional artist. This belief system was prevalent in nude art. Women were depicted as passive, and they did not possess any control over their image. The female nude during the Renaissance was an image created by the male gaze. It is an eroticized image that holds the heterosexual male desire.\n\nIn Jill Fields’ article “Frontiers in Feminist Art History”, Fields examines the feminist art movement and how they attempted to change the image of the female nude. She considers how the image of the female nude was created and how the feminist art history movement attempted to change the way the image of the female nude was represented. Derived from the Renaissance ideal of feminine beauty, the image of the female body was created by men and for a male audience. In paintings like Gustave Courbet's,\" The Origin of the World,\" and Francois Boucher's, \"Reclining Girl\", women are expressed with open legs. This symbol implies that women are to be passive and they are an object to be used. The feminist art history movement has aimed to change the way this image is perceived. The female nude has become less of an icon in Western art since the 1990s, but this decline in importance did not stop members of the feminist art movement from incorporating things like the “central core” image. This way of representing the nude female figure in art was focused on the fact that women were in control of their own image. The central image was focused on vulva related symbols. By incorporating new images and symbols into the female nude image in Western art, the feminist art history movement continues to try and dismantle the male-dominated art world.\n\nThe nude image in art has affected women of color in a different way than it has white women, according to Charmaine Nelson. The different depictions of the nude in art has not only instituted a system of controlling the image of women but it has put women of color in a place of other. The intersection of their identities, as Nelson asserts, creates a “doubly fetishized black female body.” Women of color are not represented to the degree that white women are in nude art from the Renaissance to the 1990s, and when they are represented it is in a different way than white women. The Renaissance ideal of female beauty did not include black women. White women were represented as a sexual image, and they were the ideal sexual image for men during the Renaissance. White women, in most major works, did not have pubic hair. Black women normally did, and this created their image in an animalistic sexual way. While the white women’s image became one of innocence and the idealized, black women were continually overtly sexualized.\n\nThe nude has also been used to make a powerful social or political statement. An example is \"The Barricade\" by George Bellows, which depicts Belgian citizens being used as human shields by Germans in World War I. Although based upon a report of a real incident in which the victims were not nude, portraying them so in the painting emphasizes their vulnerability and universal humanity.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Panels usually include a moderator who guides the discussion and sometimes elicits audience questions, with the goal of being informative and entertaining. Film panels at fan conventions have been credited with boosting box office returns by generating advance buzz.\n\nThe typical format for a discussion panel includes a moderator in front of an audience.\n\nTelevision shows in the English-speaking world that feature a discussion panel format include \"Real Time with Bill Maher\", \"Loose Women\", \"The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore\", as well as segments of the long-running \"Meet the Press\". Quiz shows featuring this format, such as \"QI\" and \"Never Mind the Buzzcocks\", are called panel games. The host of a panel is typically expected to bring a token refreshment or snack to the discussants.\n\nPanels at sci-fi fan conventions, such as San Diego Comic-Con and New York Comic-Con, have become increasingly popular; there are typically long lines to get access to the panels. The panels often feature advance looks at upcoming films and video games. Panels and the early screenings at conventions have been credited as increasing the popularity of blockbuster films in recent years.\n\nOne of the earliest film panels was at the 1976 San Diego Comic-Con, when publicist Charles Lippincott hosted a slideshow—in front of a \"somewhat skeptical\" audience—for an upcoming film called \"Star Wars\". Five years later, the \"Blade Runner\" panel at the 1981 San Diego Comic-Con featured a film featurette, before featurettes were popular. At the 2000 event, \"\" preview panel ushered in today's era of hugely popular panels.\n\n"}
{"id": "14488873", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14488873", "title": "Pedra Furada", "text": "Pedra Furada\n\nPedra Furada (, meaning pierced rock) is an important collection of over 800 archaeological sites in the state of Piauí, Brazil. These include hundreds of rock paintings dating from circa 11,000 years ago. Charcoal from very ancient fires and stone shards that may be interpreted as tools suggest the possibility of a human presence prior to the arrival of Clovis people in North America.\n\nIn 1973, a Brazilian and French team excavating a site located in the southeastern portion of what is now the Serra da Capivara National Park discovered the first finds. The discovery was reported by the Brazilian archaeologist Niède Guidon, who published her findings in 1986. She has since conducted extensive excavations and published other findings.\n\nPedra Furada includes a collection of rock shelters used for thousands of years by human populations. The first excavations yielded charcoal deposits with Carbon-14 dates of 48,000 to 32,000 years BP. Repeated analysis has confirmed this dating, carrying the range of dates up to 60,000 BP. A review of the site by archaeologist Tom Dillehay in 1994 suggested that the charcoal remains may have been from natural fires and were not necessarily indicative of human occupation.\n\nGuidon has established 15 distinct levels, classified in three cultural phases, called \"Pedra Furada\", that includes the oldest remains; and \"Serra Talhada\", from 12,000 to 7,000 BP, with tools such as knives, scrapers, flakes used \"as is\" or with some retouch and lithic cores, all made of quartz or quartzite. Third is \"Agreste\" late phase. The site also has hundreds of rock paintings dated from 5,000 to 11,000 years ago.\n\nMore recently, the site of Toca da Tira Peia, also in Serra da Capivara National Park, was shown to have signs of human presence dating to 22,000 years ago.\n\nAlso the nearby site of Sitio do Meio has been excavated over the years. Although not as old, in some ways it helps to support and clarify the chronology of Pedra Furada. The lithics at Sitio do Meio are better preserved.\n\nThe discoveries are the subject of debate as they apparently contradict the longstanding \"Clovis first\" view for the settlement of humans in the Americas, which holds that the first inhabitants of the continent were representatives of the Clovis culture, which began roughly 11,500 BP. Discoveries at other sites, such as Monte Verde, Chile, dated to 14,800 years BP, Piedra Museo in the Argentinian province of Santa Cruz, dated 11,000 years BP, Topper in the state of South Carolina, U.S.A. dated 16,000–20,000 years BP, and the Meadowcroft Rockshelter located near Avella in Washington County in southwestern Pennsylvania, United States, dated to 16,000 years BP, have also raised doubts about the \"Clovis First\" theory. As a result, scholars have proposed alternate scenarios for the routes of colonization and the diffusion of culture through the continents, in a heated dispute that has not been resolved.\n\nThe mainstream view of the peopling of the Americas, also known as the \"short chronology theory,\" is that the first movement beyond Alaska into the New World occurred no earlier than 15,000 – 17,000 years ago, followed by successive waves of immigrants. Pedra Furada provides potential evidence for the proponents of the \"long chronology theory,\" which states that the first group of people entered the hemisphere at a much earlier date, possibly 21,000–40,000 years ago, with a much later mass secondary wave of immigrants. This evidence is considered controversial and not widely accepted by experts in the field. A caribou bone used as a scraper, found at the Old Crow Flats site in Canada was thought to be 27,000 years old in the 1970s was used to support the \"long chronology theory\". A re-dating, with more modern techniques in the 1990s came up with an age of 2,000 years.\n\nDebate continues as to whether or not the artifacts and hearths are instead geofacts that were made naturally, or alternatively, made by monkeys. Wild bearded capuchin monkeys (\"Sapajus libidinosus\") in Serra da Capivara National Park have been observed smashing stones against rocks embedded in the ground. The resulting 'shaped' rocks and flakes are similar to early hominid tools and flakes. It has been suggested that similar behavior, by earlier simians, might account for what have been regarded as human tools at Pedra Furada. James Adovasio of Florida Atlantic University believes that the tools identified by Guidon as human made are rocks that fell from a cliff and broke when they hit the ground. “The Pedra Furada stuff is not even up to capuchin standards,” he said. (The capuchin behavior also has implications for interpretations of the simplest Oldowan technology in East African). This seems to be a dividing line on the debate among archaeologists disputing Guidon's theory that the site's artifacts prove pre-Clovis human settlement in the Americas.\n\nIn 2000 the controversy was characterized by Alex Bellos, at \"The Guardian,\" as U.S. archaeologists believe that the items are geofacts created naturally, \"because the North Americans cannot believe that they do not have the oldest site\", while David Meltzer, of the Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas asks \"...if we have [pre-Clovis] humans in South America, then by golly, why don't we have them in North America too?\" \n\nResponding to this Guidon suggested a sea voyage across the Atlantic as a potential route for the first migration. \n\nIn an article in the \"New York Times\" Guidon claimed occupation of the Americas could go back 100,000 years and the first settlers 'might have come not overland from Asia but by boat from Africa'.\n\nMichael R. Waters, a geoarchaeologist at Texas A&M University noted the absence of genetic evidence in modern populations to support Guidon's claim. The Buttermilk Creek Complex in Texas was discovered in 2006 and dated at about 15,500 BP. \n\nThen, in 2017 a hearth excavated on Triquet Island off British Columbia was determine to be 14,000 years old, making it one of the oldest human settlements ever discovered in North America and bolstering the Pacific Coastal Migration route hypothosis.\n\nGuidon has said that, \"The carbon is not from a natural fire. It is only found inside the sites. You don't get natural fires inside the shelters.\" French palaeolithic archaeologist Jacques Pelegrin, believes there is a possibility for natural processes creating flaked stones that could mimic the Pedra Furada specimens because of their simplicity, but he finds this very unlikely in this case because of continuous human presence in the site.\n\n\nAIMOLA, Giulia et al. \"Final Pleistocene and Early Holocene at Sitio do Meio, Piauí, Brazil: Stratigraphy and comparison with Pedra Furada.\" Journal of Lithic Studies, [S.l.], v. 1, n. 2, p. 5-24, sep. 2014.

{"id": "445636", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=445636", "title": "Philip Converse", "text": "Philip Converse\n\nPhilip Ernest Converse (November 17, 1928 – December 30, 2014) was an American political scientist. He was a professor emeritus in political science and sociology at the University of Michigan (PhD 1958) who was a seminal figure in the field of public opinion, survey research, and quantitative social science. He has been described as \"one of the most important social scientists of the 20th century.”\n\nConverse's widely-cited book chapter \"The Nature of Belief Systems in Mass Publics\" (\"Ideology and Discontent\", edited by David E. Apter, 1964) held that most people lack structure and stability in their political views. With Angus Campbell, Warren Miller, and Donald Stokes, he co-wrote \"The American Voter\", an instrumental work of political science using data from the American National Election Studies, a set of important surveys of American public opinion carried out by the University of Michigan Survey Research Center and the Center for Political Studies. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1969.\n\nPhilip Converse was the younger brother of Connie Converse, one of the earliest-known practitioners of the singer-songwriter genre of popular music. Philip died of lung disease on December 30, 2014, aged 86.\n\nPhilip Converse was born November 17, 1928, in Concord, New Hampshire. He earned his B.A. in English at Denison University in 1949, and he earned a master's degree in English literature from the University of Iowa in 1950. Converse was drafted into U.S. military service during the Korean War, working as a newspaper editor on a base in Battle Creek, MI.\n\nConverse studied for a time in France before returning to the United States to earn an M.A. in sociology at the University of Michigan in 1956, followed by a Ph.D. in social psychology at Michigan in 1958. As he began his graduate education, Converse worked as the assistant study director of Michigan's Survey Research Center, joining forces with Warren Miller and Angus Campbell to field the 1956-1960 National Election Study panel survey. That work produced the foundational text for political behavior, \"The American Voter\" (1960). He would serve in leadership roles for the Center and for the broader Institute for Social Research (ISR) in which it was housed for the rest of his career, including as director of the Center for Political Studies (1981-1986) and director of ISR itself (1986-1989).\n\nIn 1961, Converse married social scientist Jean G. McDowell, an expert in interviewing techniques who directed the Detroit Area Study.\n\nConverse became an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Michigan in 1960, the same year as his co-authored seminal treatise \"The American Voter\" was published. He quickly earned tenure with promotion to associate professor in 1964, as his celebrated essay on belief systems was published. One year later, he was promoted to the rank of full professor in sociology and a joint appointment in political science. After being awarded two named chair positions in the 1970s and 1980s, Converse was selected as the 1987 Henry Russel Lecturer, the University's highest honor given to a senior faculty member.\n\nConverse left the University of Michigan to become director of the Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University in 1989. He returned to the University of Michigan as an emeritus professor of sociology and political science in 1994.\n\nPhilip Converse died December 30, 2014, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, at the age of 86. He was survived by his wife, Jean, and his two sons.\n\nConverse is best known for his work on ideology and belief systems, voters and elections, partisanship, political representation, party systems, the human meaning of social change, and political sophistication. His work drew on extensive public opinion survey data from the United States and France.\n\nIn \"The Nature of Belief Systems in Mass Publics,\" Converse challenged the notion that ordinary citizens share the sophisticated ideological structure in political thinking seen among political elites. He argues first that belief systems are ultimately about \"constraint\"—if one's view changes on an issue central to the belief system, that change shifts attitudes throughout the network of other views when constraint is high. In contrast, other views do not change in a low-constraint belief system when another attitude changes. Converse says belief systems are constructed by political elites, who decide the issue views that go together, and he says political information is key for determining whether members of the mass public are capable of following these connections in their own thinking.\n\nNext, Converse empirically analyzes belief systems in the mass public using survey data from the 1956-58-60 American National Election Study. He proceeds in four parts. In the first section, he shows that, when asked to describe their views on the political parties and candidates, very few Americans rely on abstract principles or other signs of ideological thinking (\"ideologues\"). Instead, the largest category of people think about politics and parties in terms of \"group benefits\" based on which prominent social groups they see as advantaged or disadvantaged by Democrats or Republicans. Others thought about parties based on the \"nature of the times\" or \"no issue content.\" In sum, regular people don't talk about politics in ideological ways.\n\nIn the second section, Converse shows that when Americans are asked explicitly to explain the terms \"liberal\" and \"conservative,\" many struggle to link those terms to the political parties and to give meaningful reasons for those pairings. This suggests a lack of ideological understanding and again pushed against the notion of an ideological public. In the third section, Converse presents evidence that issue preferences in the public show low constraint, as seen in low correlations between issue pairs. This stands in contrast to relatively high constraint observed in the views of political elites. Finally, Converse shows that political attitudes are highly unstable in the mass public over time. On some issues, the public provides such inconsistent responses over two and four years that they appear to be responding almost as if at random. If ordinary people had idiosyncratic belief systems, he argues their views would be stable over time. The instability he observes is the final strike against the notion of an ideologically sophisticated public.\n\nConverse concludes that mass publics generally lack the structured belief systems seen in political elites, and he speculates that this finding from mid-century America applies broadly across publics in other places and eras.\n\nIn a 1970 essay, Converse calls these highly unstable political views \"non-attitudes.\"\n\nConverse's book \"Political Representation in France\" with Roy Pierce on mass politics in France draws similar conclusions about belief systems.\n\nConverse also co-authored \"The American Voter\" with Angus Campbell, Warren Miller, and Donald Stokes. The book is one of the earliest and most influential assessments of electoral behavior in political science. One of the book's primary contributions was the introduction of the social-psychological concept of partisan identity and investigations into its effects on political behavior. Partisanship, they say, is functions more as an attachment to a social group than as a mere summary of political values and attitudes, and it is the fundamental driver in vote choice and much else. This theory became known as the Michigan Model. They also find that citizens who choose not to identify with a political party are generally disengaged from politics and low in political knowledge, in contrast to idealized views celebrating the independent voter. Evidence for the book was drawn from analysis of the 1956-68 National Election Studies panel. \"The American Voter\" also assesses factors that influence voter turnout, the influence of electoral rules, effects from social and economic conditions, the roles of group identity and socio-economic position, and it introduces some of the initial analysis that underlies Converse's 1964 \"Nature of Belief Systems\" essay. The book also introduces other important concepts like the \"funnel of causality\" modeling the long-term and short-term forces leading eventually to an individual's vote, and the \"normal vote\" model relating partisanship and turnout in election outcomes.\n\nPhilip Converse is one of the most influential political scientists in history.

{"id": "18918759", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18918759", "title": "Pornoviolence", "text": "Pornoviolence\n\n\"Pornoviolence\" is an essay by American author Tom Wolfe. It first appeared under a longer title in the July 1967 issue of \"Esquire\" magazine, and was later published in the collection \"Mauve Gloves & Madmen, Clutter & Vine\". The essay introduced the term \"pornoviolence\" in reference to graphic written or audiovisual depictions of violence, which Wolfe argued were used in newspapers, magazines, and film to stimulate prurient audience interest.\n\nThe essay was intended to decry the media's habit of glorifying violence as a way of gratifying their audience, in the same way a pornographic film does using sex. Aside from attacking popular culture, such as the articles of \"The National Enquirer\" and its imitators, Wolfe also levels his criticism at more mainstream art, including Truman Capote's controversial non-fiction novel \"In Cold Blood\". He argues that, in the absence of mystery and the unpredictable, Capote's book retains the audience's attention with the promise of disclosing gruesome details about the true crime it discusses, thus degenerating the work to the level of sadistic sensationalism, or, indeed, pornoviolence.\n\n\"Pornoviolence\" as a term has subsequently been used to disparage excessively violent content in books, horror films, and video games.\n\n"}
{"id": "22447334", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22447334", "title": "Prank call", "text": "Prank call\n\nA prank call (also known as a crank call, phony call or hoax call) is a telephone practical joke. Prank phone calls began to gain a worldwide following since the invention of telephones, as they became a staple of the obscure and amusing cassette tapes traded among musicians, sound engineers, and media traders beginning in the late 1970s. Among the most famous and earliest recorded prank calls are the Tube Bar prank calls tapes, which centered on Louis \"Red\" Deutsch. Comedian Jerry Lewis was an incorrigible phone prankster, and recordings of his hijinks, dating from the 1960s and possibly earlier, still circulate to this day.\n\nVery prominent people have fallen victim to prank callers, for example Elizabeth II, who was fooled by Canadian DJ Pierre Brassard posing as Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, asking her to record a speech in support of Canadian unity ahead of the 1995 Quebec referendum. Two other notable examples of prank calls were made by the Miami-based radio station Radio El Zol. In one, they telephoned Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez, and spoke to him pretending to be Cuban president Fidel Castro. They later reversed the prank, calling Castro and pretending to be Chávez. Castro began swearing at the pranksters live on air after they revealed themselves.\n\nPrank callers can now be easily found through Caller ID, so it is often asserted that since the 1990s, prank calls have been harder to accomplish and thus waning in popularity. Most telephone companies permit callers to withhold the identifying information from calls using the vertical service code *67 that blocks the caller's ID (141 in the UK), but potential victims may be reluctant to answer a call from an ID-blocked number. Wiretapping by several governments have also made prank calls easier to trace. Callers can also call from payphones in order to hide their identity, although this is becoming less common as pay phones are beginning to phase out starting in the late 2000s. The advent and advancements in digital switching technologies such as those found in SS7, unspoofable ANI, as well as outbound and inbound calls being logged at carrier exchange equipment, further complicate the pranksters will to remain anonymous while carrying out such activities.\n\nAnother increasingly popular option is to use some form of VoIP. With some VoIP services, the telephone number will simply not exist. These calls are extremely difficult to trace since they may pass through servers and routers operated by multiple corporations or entities in various countries. Although law enforcement agencies may theoretically be able to find where a VoIP call originates from if they tried, in practice the amount of time, effort, and resources required would be too great to use on ordinary prank calls.\n\nSometimes, prank callers are able to connect with political leaders. In December 2005, a commercially operated radio station in Spain (COPE – owned by a series of institutions affiliated with the Catholic Church) played a prank on Bolivian president-elect Evo Morales. The hoaxster pretended to be Spanish Prime Minister José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, congratulating Morales on his election and saying things like, \"I imagine the only one not to have called you was George Bush. I've been here two years and he still hasn't called me\".\n\nEver since the opportunity has been available, there have been multiple internet radio stations dedicated to prank calls. Most of them feature a so-called \"rotation\" of prank calls, which is a constant broadcast of various prank calls submitted by the community, usually streamed from a SHOUTcast server host. Software such as Ventrilo has allowed prank calls to be carried out to a more private user-base, however, in real-time.\n\nThe internet has allowed many people to share their own personal prank calls and develop into communities. Prank calls can be carried out in many ways; live or pre-recorded. Sites such as Stickam and Ustream allow hosts to carry out prank calls live to thousands of listeners, who can also chat and discuss on-goings in real-time. The use of social networking and the popularity of user generated content also allows these prank calls to spread and popularity to grow. \n\nSome prank calls are criminalized in many jurisdictions, for instance if the call involves calling the emergency services, while others may be protected as freedom of expression. For example, in the US, for a prank call to fall afoul of the Telecommunications Act, , the call must be done with the intent to \"abuse, threaten, or harass\". In Australia, the 2Day FM incident is alleged by ACMA to have violated Australian law, but on the grounds that the recorded call was publicly broadcast without the other party's consent.\n\nRudimentary criminal 'pranks' may range from simple telephone harassment to bomb threats. One such hoax call occurred in Perth, Western Australia, on New Year's Eve 2002, when a drunk teenager called the new anti-terrorist hot line to report a bomb threat against the New Year's Eve fireworks celebrations. The threat was taken seriously, and the celebrations were about to be cancelled when police discovered that no such threat existed. The teenager was then arrested for the false report.\n\nMore elaborate pranks rely on tricking the recipient into harmful behavior. An example of these was the 1996–2004 strip search phone call scam, in which a prankster posing as a police officer was able to cause store managers to strip search female employees. More recently, the Pranknet virtual community has been credited for causing tens of thousands of dollars in damage to many hotels and fast food restaurants. Posing as authority figures, such as fire alarm company representatives and hotel corporate managers, Pranknet participants called unsuspecting employees and customers in the United States via Skype and tricked them into damaging property, setting off fire sprinklers and other humiliating acts such as disrobing. They also post fraudulent ads on Craigslist, and then shout racial epithets and make violent threats of rape and murder against the people who call them to respond to the ads. Pranknet members listen in real-time and discuss the progress together in a private chat room. The group, who flaunted their anonymity, were outed when editors of \"The Smoking Gun\", posing as journalists, persuaded them to visit unique URLs.\n\nA series of prank calls by Joseph Sherer led to convictions and a twenty-year prison sentence for impersonating a physician, criminal endangerment, and aggravated assault. In one call, as described by the Montana Supreme Court, \"Sherer, impersonating a sympathetic and caring doctor, instructed the victim to cut off her nipple. The victim's obedient actions flowed directly from Sherer's instructions.\"\n\nUntil his death in 2011, Oklahoma construction worker Frank Garrett was prank called and recorded countless times for his vitriolic reactions. The soundboard community that followed him caused at least three known incidents with the law: two in Kansas City, Missouri and a third in Houston; both were for threats of violence against residents and the police with his name being used in the process. Both incidents were covered by local FOX News stations. \n\nIn 2012, Jacintha Saldanha, a nurse at King Edward VII hospital who was attending a pregnant Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, was deceived into transferring a prank call from Mel Greig and Mike Christian, the hosts of the \"Hot30 Countdown\" radio program broadcast on 2Day FM in Sydney, Australia, who were impersonating Queen Elizabeth II and Charles, Prince of Wales. The hoaxsters were able to ask the duty nurse questions about the duchess' health, making the answers public. Saldanha was later found dead in a suspected suicide. The incident and the following death received intense media coverage and triggered an investigation, but no charges were laid.\n\nPrank calls frequently appear in many earlier episodes of \"The Simpsons\", as Bart calls Moe's Tavern asking for people whose names are actually double entendres. Examples include \"Mike Rotch\" (my crotch), \"Bea O'Problem\" (B.O. problem), \"Al Coholic\" (alcoholic), \"Amanda Hugginkiss\" (a man to hug and kiss), and \"Anita Bath\" (I need a bath). Moe then asks his clientele if the person is present, embarrassing himself in the process. However, in the episode \"Flaming Moe's\", Bart's prank call backfires when he calls up asking for a \"Hugh Jass\" (huge ass), only for a man with the same name to answer. And in \"Donnie Fatso\", Fat Tony accidentally calls Moe asking for his business partner, \"Yuri Nator\" (urinator).\n\n\"Weird Al\" Yankovic's song \"Phony Calls\" (a parody of \"Waterfalls\" by TLC, featured on his 1996 album \"Bad Hair Day\") deals with prank phone calls. Specifically, it talks about the \"Is your refrigerator running?\" gag and the \"Do you have Prince Albert in a can?\" gag. It also incorporates Bart Simpson's aforementioned \"Mike Rotch\" prank phone call. \n\nOn an episode of \"Pee-Wee's Playhouse\", the mischievous Randy makes a prank call (the classic \"Is your refrigerator running? Then you better catch it!\" gag) and talks Pee-Wee into doing so also. The recipient of the call is irritated and gets her husband on the phone, who happens to be a police officer. The officer sternly warns Pee-Wee that making prank calls is against the law and that it can result in going to jail and a lifetime criminal record.\n\nThe Cartoon Network series \"Regular Show\" featured an episode centered around prank calls in its first season, entitled \"Prank Callers\". Inspired by watching online videos of the \"world's best prank caller\", the show's protagonists, Mordecai and Rigby, attempt to make several prank calls of their own. After the two fail to prank the world's best prank caller, they are sent back in time to 1982, and are later joined by the rest of the show's main cast. The episode then focuses on the group's efforts to return to their proper time period, by pranking the aforementioned prank caller. in the episode entitled \"House Rules\" Benson decrees a series of dubious rules. one of which forbids the use of making prank calls, causing Mordecai and Rigby to abandon him of their own free will.

This call led Rick, star of \"Pawn Stars\" and owner of the store, to repeatedly swear and yell at the prank callers. The 4chan callers recorded this and uploaded it to YouTube, and subsequently many videos related to prank callers dialing random establishments and asking about \"Battletoads\" have been uploaded.\n\nIn an episode of Seinfeld Jerry is out and Kramer takes his messages noting calls from \"George, Elaine, George again, Newman...but THAT was a crank call.\"\n"}

{"id": "5162132", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5162132", "title": "Return of the Blind Dead", "text": "Return of the Blind Dead\n\nReturn of the Blind Dead, also known as Return of the Evil Dead and El ataque de los muertos sin ojos (translation: \"Attack of the Eyless Dead\"), is a 1973 Spanish horror film written and directed by Amando de Ossorio.\n\nThe film is the second in Ossorio's \"Blind Dead\" series, and the sequel to \"Tombs of the Blind Dead\" (1972). It was followed by \"The Ghost Galleon\" (1974).\n\nThe film opens with a flashback to 13th century Bouzano, Portugal. A peasant mob has captured the Knights Templar and is preparing to burn them for witchcraft and murder. One of the captured knights (Luis Barboo) swears revenge on the village. The villagers (in a break from the first film) burn the knights' eyes out with torches before burning them to death.\n\nThe film flashes ahead to the present, where the village prepares for a festival celebrating the 500th anniversary of the defeat of the Templars. The village idiot, Murdo (José Canalejas), watches the preparations until being attacked and stoned by a pack of children. The children are run off by Moncha (Loreta Tovar) and Juan (José Thelman), romantically involved locals.\n\nBack in the town square, firework technician and former military captain Jack Marlowe (Tony Kendall) meets Mayor Duncan (Fernando Sancho), his assistant Dacosta (Ramón Lillo) and his fiancee/secretary Vivian (Esperanza Roy). It is revealed that Jack and Vivian have a personal history, establishing a tension between the four characters. Jack and Vivian take a walk, where she reveals that she purposely hired Jack to rekindle their romance. Their walk takes them to the abbey graveyard where the Templars are buried. Their romantic interlude is interrupted by peeping Murdo, who proceeds to warn them of the Templars' impending return. After Jack and Vivian depart, Murdo murders a young townswoman that he has kidnapped as a blood sacrifice.\n\nWhile the festival is in full swing, the Templars rise, awakened by Murdo's sacrifice. At the festival, Jack convinces Vivian to leave with him. Their interactions raise the ire of Duncan and Dacosta, who are a keeping a close eye on the pair.\n\nBack at the graveyard, the Templars ride down Murdo (but leave him alive) and head toward town. On their way, they come across Moncha's house, where she is in the midst of a sexual rendezvous with Juan. Juan is killed but Moncha escapes on an undead Templar horse. She stops for help at the rail station, where she persuades the station manager (Francisco Sanz) of the danger by revealing her zombie horse. She runs off, as he tries to call the mayor.\n\nWhile the phone rings in his office, the mayor dispatches Dacosta and his henchmen to assault Jack. The beating is finally interrupted when the call from the station manager gets through. The mayor is skeptical, and believes the manager to be drunk. He sends Dacosta to the station to take over. The Templars arrive at the station and kill the manager.\n\nMeanwhile, Jack and Vivian leave in Jack's car. They encounter the traumatized Moncha in the middle of the road and bring her back to town. Dacosta and another of Duncan's goons, Beirao (Ramón Lillo), encounter the knights as they approach the train station. They hurry back to the village and warn the mayor of the oncoming horde.\n\nThe mayor calls the governor (Juan Cazalilla) to request help, but his pleas fall on deaf ears as the governor assumes Duncan to be drunk and reprimands him. The governor is the third person (after the station manager, and then the mayor) to ignore warnings of the coming Templars, assuming the messenger to be drunk.\n\nThe knights descend on the village and the festival turns into a massacre. Jack organizes Dacosta and some of the villagers into a defense force, as Duncan scrambles to gather his valuables and then looks on from the balcony. Eventually, Jack and Dacosta clear an escape for most of the villagers. Jack, Vivian, Dacosta, Moncha and Duncan are all left behind. They try to get away in Jack's car, but are overwhelmed by zombies and escape into the church, where Beirao and his wife Amalia (Lone Fleming), are holed up with their daughter (Maria Nuria). Once inside the church, the group finds Murdo hiding out.\n\nThe survivors begin fortifying the church against the undead siege, but before long, unity begins to erode. After failing once again to convince the governor of their plight, Duncan persuades Beirao to make a break for the car. He is killed in the attempt. Meanwhile, Murdo persuades Moncha to come with him into the tunnels beneath the church to escape. After Beirao's failed attempt, Duncan tries to escape using Beirao and Amalia's young daughter as bait. He is killed and the child is left in grave peril among the Templars. Jack and Amalia manage to save her, with Amalia sacrificing her own life in the process.\n\nDown in the tunnels, Murdo is decapitated by the knights as he climbs out to the surface and Moncha is subsequently pulled by her head through the opening and killed.\n\nBack in the church, Dacosta catches Vivian alone. Resigned to a grim fate, he attempts to rape her before the Templars kill him. Jack rescues Vivian, and Dacosta is impaled on a spear in the ensuing scuffle.\n\nAs the night wears on, Jack and Vivian decide to chance escaping. They convince Amalia's daughter that the zombies and her mother's death were both part of a nightmare and then blindfold her as they attempt to silently creep through the square full of blind dead. As they slip past the Knights, the little girl peeks out of her blindfold and screams as she sees the zombies surrounding them. However, the Templars make no move, and then crumple to the ground in the breaking morning light. Jack, Vivian and the child walk away from the village as the credits roll.\n\n\nAs in the other three films in the series, de Ossorio wrote, directed and designed the Templar make-up for the film and composer Anton Garcia Gabril scored it.\n\nOssorio characterized the financing and production of the film as \"very difficult... very complicated\", and claimed he had never been paid by the distributor.\n\nThe principle shooting location for the festival scenes and the church exterior was the Plaza de la Iglesia located in the pueblo of El Vellon in Madrid, Spain.\n\nDe Ossorio described the film as having \"political aspects\", evidenced by the mayor who looks to abandon the town and save himself when the Templars attack.\n\nAuthor and critic Jamie Russell described the thematic link between sex and death in the films as \"a pessimistic vision in which youth and beauty are always destroyed\". Russell asserted that \"sex becomes nothing more than prelude...that brings us ever closer to the final end\", and that \"flesh is simply a reminder of our own mortality\".\n\nThere are multiple cuts of the film. The uncut Spanish language version, \"El ataque de los muertos sin ojos\", runs over four minutes longer than the international English-language cut, \"Return of the Evil Dead\", and contains longer, more explicit gore sequences. The opening of the English cut contains a truncated version of the Templars' blood sacrifice before the villagers capture and kill the knights. In the Spanish version, the sacrifice flashback occurs when Murdo warns Jack and Vivian about the coming return of the Templars, and contains shots of the virgin's heart being removed and eaten by the knights. In the \"Return of the Evil Dead\" cut, Murdo does not sacrifice a local girl to incite the Templars resurrection, and when he's decapitated later in the film, the shot of his headless, spurting neck is removed. Several names are changed and/or Anglicized in the English dub of the film: the village of Bouzano is renamed Berzano, Moncha is Monica, Juan is Don, Dacosta is Howard, Beirao is Bert and Amalia's unnamed daughter is Nancy.\n\nBoth versions were included on the Blue Underground DVD release of the film.\n\nRotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reported that 14% of seven surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 3.9 out of 10. Paul Corupe of DVD Verdict called it \"less a sequel than a complete re-imagining of the first film\" that owes a debt to \"Night of the Living Dead\". Adam Tyner of DVD Talk wrote, \"Sitting through \"The Return of the Evil Dead\" is like wading through one of the later \"Jaws\" sequels; yes, the body count is exponentially higher, the Knights Templar are in virtually every scene, there's an attempt to keep the pacing amped up...and in the process, pretty much everything worthwhile about the original is discarded\". Writing in \"The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia\", academic Peter Dendle said that the film was more influenced by \"Night of the Living Dead\" than \"Tombs\", as it rewrote the history of the Knights and does not follow the first film's continuity, and noted, \"Though \"Return\" lacks the charming simplicity of the first \"Blind Dead\" film, it does sustain a gradual building of tension more successfully than \"Tombs\"\".\n\n"}
{"id": "13302082", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13302082", "title": "Revelation Space universe", "text": "Revelation Space universe\n\nThe \"Revelation Space\" universe is a fictional universe which was created by Alastair Reynolds and used as the setting for a number of his novels and stories. Its fictional history follows the human species through various conflicts from the relatively near future (roughly 2200) to approximately 40,000 AD (all the novels to date are set between 2427 and 2727, although certain stories extend beyond this period). It takes its name from \"Revelation Space\", which was the first published novel set in the universe.\n\nThe name \"\"Revelation Space\" universe\" has been used by Alastair Reynolds in both the introductory text in the collections \"Diamond Dogs, Turquoise Days\" and \"Galactic North\", and also on several editions of the novels set in the universe.\n\nThe \"Revelation Space\" universe is set in a future version of our world, with the addition of a number of extraterrestrial species and advanced technologies that are not necessarily grounded in current science. It is, nonetheless, somewhat \"harder\" than most examples of space opera, relying to a considerable extent on science Reynolds believes to be possible; in particular, faster-than-light travel is largely absent. Reynolds has said he prefers to keep the science in his fiction plausible, but he will adopt science he believes will be impossible when it is necessary for the story.\n\nWhile a great deal of science fiction reflects either very optimistic or dystopian visions of the human future, the Revelation Space universe is notable in that human societies have not developed to either positive or negative extremes. Instead, despite their dramatically advanced technology, they are similar to those of today in terms of their moral ambiguity and mixture of cruelty and decency, corruption and opportunity.\n\nThe \"Revelation Space\" universe contains elements of Lovecraftian horror, with one posthuman entity stating explicitly that some things in the universe are fundamentally beyond human or transhuman understanding. Nevertheless, the main storyline is essentially optimistic, with humans continuing to survive even in a universe that seems fundamentally hostile to intelligent life.\n\nThe name \"Revelation Space\" appears in the novel of the same name during Philip Lascaille's account of his visit to Lascaille's Shroud, an anomalous region of the local universe. Lascaille says that \"the key\" to something momentous \"was explained to me [. . .] while I was in Revelation Space.\"\n\nThe chronology of the \"Revelation Space\" universe extends to roughly one billion years into the past, when the \"Dawn War\" — a galaxy-spanning conflict over the availability of various natural resources — resulted in almost all sentient life in the galaxy being wiped out. One race of survivors, later termed the Inhibitors, having converted itself to machine form, predicted that the impending Andromeda–Milky Way collision, roughly 3 billion years in our future, may severely damage the capacity of either galaxy to support life. Consequently, they planned to adjust the positions of stars in order to limit the damage the collision would cause. Also central to the Inhibitor project was the eradication of all species above a certain technological level until the crisis was over (as they believed no organic species would be capable of co-operating on such a large-scale project). Whilst they were relatively successful, certain advanced species were able to hide from Inhibitor forces, or even fight back.\n\nIn human history, during 21st and 22nd centuries numerous wars occurred, and a flotilla of generation ships were deployed to colonise a planet orbiting the star 61 Cygni (this becomes a major segment of the plot of \"Chasm City\"). The flotilla was later to reach a planet termed Sky's Edge, which was to be embroiled in war until human civilisation there was eradicated.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Solar System in 2190, the Conjoiners emerged as a result of increased experimentation with neural implants. In response, the Coalition for Neural Purity was formed, opposed to the Conjoiners. Nevil Clavain fought on the side of the Coalition in the ensuing war, but defected later on after being betrayed. Clavain, and the Conjoiners, succeeded in escaping the Solar System and left for surrounding stars.\n\nFor the next few centuries, the so-called \"Belle Epoque\", humanity enjoyed a period of relative peace and prosperity, with several planets being colonised. The most successful planet of all was Yellowstone, a planet orbiting the star Epsilon Eridani, site of the Glitter Band / Rust Belt and Chasm City. Technologies developed included the Conjoiner Drive, a gift from the Conjoiners (who resumed contact with humanity at an unknown time), advanced nanotechnology, and numerous other devices. With the exception of an attempted takeover of the Glitter Band, no major incidents affected humanity during this time.\n\nThe \"Belle Epoque\" was terminated by the advent of the Melding Plague in 2510, a nanotechnological virus that destroyed all other nanotechnology it came into contact with. Only the Conjoiners were unaffected by this disaster, which devastated the civilisation around Yellowstone. War between the Demarchists and Conjoiners erupted as a result of the plague.\n\nMeanwhile, activities around a far-flung human colony on the planet Resurgam, orbiting the star Delta Pavonis, inadvertently attracted the attention of the Inhibitors. The Conjoiners, also made aware of this event, sent Clavain to recover the exceedingly powerful \"Cache Weapons\" from this system (said weapons having been stolen from the Conjoiners centuries before) that could be used to fend off the Inhibitors while the Conjoiners escaped. Clavain instead defected from the Conjoiners, intending to use the weapons to protect all of humanity. Skade, another Conjoiner, was sent to stop him and recover the weapons. They fought around the Resurgam system, with Clavain and his allies eventually obtaining the weapons. Clavain's ally Remontoire agreed to seek out alien assistance from the Hades Matrix, a nearby alien computer disguised as a neutron star, whilst Clavain sheltered refugees from Resurgam on another planet, later termed Ararat.\n\nRemontoire returned in 2675, only a few days after Clavain's death at the hands of Skade, who had arrived with him. Remontoire and his allies were now at war with the Inhibitors, assisted by alien technology obtained from Hades. Even so, it was realised that the humans would not last indefinitely, and Clavain's people, now led by Scorpio decided to seek out the mysterious \"Shadows\", a race believed to be near a moon called Hela, site of a theocracy. Aura, daughter of Ana Khouri (an ally of Remontoire) infiltrated the theocracy under the pseudonym Rashmika Els. After considerable conflict, Scorpio and Aura realised that contacting the Shadows was inadvisable. They instead contacted the Nestbuilders, who provided them with weapons capable of defeating the Inhibitors. As such, the Inhibitors were effectively eradicated from human space, with buffer zones and frontiers established to keep them at bay.\n\nHumanity then enjoyed a second, 400-year-long golden age. After this, however, came the Greenfly outbreak, in which human civilisation was destroyed by a rogue terraforming system of human origin that destroyed planets and converted them to millions of orbiting, vegetation-filled habitats. The Greenfly began to subsume most of human space, with all efforts to stop them failing. The storyline of the Revelation Space universe thus far concludes with humanity leaving the Milky Way galaxy in an attempt to set up a new civilisation elsewhere.\n\nAll short stories and novellas in this universe to date are collected in \"Galactic North\" and \"Diamond Dogs, Turquoise Days\", with the exception of \"Monkey Suit\" and \"The Last Log of the Lachrimosa\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The SEVP encompasses the F status (for foreign students in the United States in academic programs and their dependents), J status (for exchange visitors in the United States and their dependents), and M status (for foreign students in the United States in vocational programs and their dependents). The exchange visitor part of the program (J visa) is managed by the U.S. Department of State, although the SEVIS system is maintained by ICE.\n\nNote that SEVP does not manage the issuance of the visas themselves. Visas are issued at United States consulates and embassies in other countries, which fall under the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Consular Affairs. However, having the correct status and information in the SEVIS system is necessary for a person to be able to receive a F, J, or M visa.\n\nNote that the SEVP does not cover some other statuses that can be used by foreign students in the United States, such as the H-4 status and other statuses for dependents of people in non-student statuses.\n\nIn the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, a truck bomb was detonated below the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City. In the aftermath of this incident, the student visa came under increased scrutiny when it was discovered that Eyad Ismoil, one of the terrorists involved was in the United States on an expired student visa.\n\nA memorandum from the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Investigative Agency Policies to the Deputy Attorney General dated September 24, 1994, mentioned the need to subject foreign students to thorough and continuing scrutiny before and during their stay in the United States. On April 17, 1995, the Deputy Attorney General asked the INS Commissioner to address this issue. This led to the formation of an INS task force in June 1995 to conduct a comprehensive review of the F, M, and J visa processes. Besides the INS, the task force included members from the State Department and the United States Information Agency, and experts in the administration of international student programs. The task force report, issued on December 22, 1995, identified problems in the tracking and monitoring of students by schools, problems in the certification of schools by the INS, and problems with INS receiving and maintaining up-to-date records from schools. As a result of these findings, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 directed the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to develop and conduct a program to collect certain information on nonimmigrant foreign students and exchange visitors from approved institutions of higher education and designated exchange visitor programs.\n\nIn June 1997, the INS launched a pilot program for a centralized electronic reporting system for institutions, called the Coordinated Interagency Partnership Regulating International Students (CIPRIS). The CIPRIS pilot officially ended in October 1999, as the INS felt it had gathered enough data from the prototype to start working on the nationwide system. The INS began working on a new system that would be called the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) with the associated information system called the Student and Exchange Visitor Information Service (SEVIS). During the rollout, CIPRIS and SEVIS met with considerable opposition from the and the American Council on Education. However, they claimed that the opposition was not against the programs in principle but due to the concern that a botched rollout by the INS could result in many students suffering.\n\nIn the aftermath of the September 11 attacks (September 11, 2001) and the Patriot Act passed in response (October 26, 2001), there was further increase in scrutiny of student visas, increasing the momentum in favor of the adoption of SEVIS. This was partly because of the fact that one of the attackers, Hani Hanjour, had come to the United States on a student visa.\n\nBelow is a timeline of the key events in the two years after the attacks describing the key steps in the evolution of SEVIS:\n\nSEVIS has undergone six major releases since its launch. The release is numbered using a major release version number followed by a dot and a minor release version number. Below is a partial list of release dates:\n\nDuring the first half of 2012, changes that affect all colleges, universities, and other educational institutions that provide English language training (\"ESL\") programs began. These changes stem from the Accreditation of English Language Training Act (\"Accreditation Act\"), which became effective in June 2011. Pursuant to the Accreditation Act, ESL programs that enroll foreign nonimmigrant students must obtain accreditation from a regional or national accreditation agency recognized by the United States Department of Education. The Accreditation Act applies to two types of ESL programs: Stand-Alone ESL Schools whose officials have indicated on the school's Form I-17 the intention to offer only ESL programs of study; and Combined Schools whose officials have indicated on the school's Form I-17 that the school offers an ESL program of study, as well as other programs of study. A Combined School may either contract out the ESL program of study or wholly own and operate the ESL program of study under the institution's governance.\n\nSchools and programs approved to host students and scholars on these visas are required to report certain information. Information that must be reported includes:\n\nIn addition, they must report events that constitute a violation of the international visitor's visa status, such as academic suspension, criminal conviction, failure to enroll and unauthorized off-campus employment.\n\nIn 2004, the United States Congress mandated that all international students and exchange visitors pay the I-901 SEVIS fee, which funds the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) and SEVIS. The fee can be paid online at fmjfee.com. As of January 2017, the fees are as follows:\n\nThe SEVIS fee must be paid after receiving the initial document (I-20 or DS-2019) and is a prerequisite for obtaining the F, J, or M visa, or if transitioning to student status using Form I-539.\n\nThe fee needs to be paid only for the principal (the F-1, J-1, or M-1). Dependents (F-2, J-2, and M-2) do not need to pay the fee. Also, the fee needs to be paid only once per initial SEVIS record, and in particular, does not need to be paid again if applying for a new visa on the same status. It is distinct from the visa fees, which need to be paid for each visa application.\n\nBelow is the list of fees for schools seeking SEVP certification (through Form I-17) or re-certification, as of January 2017.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "421981", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=421981", "title": "Substitute good", "text": "Substitute good\n\nA substitute good is a good that can be used in place of another. In consumer theory, substitute goods or substitutes are products that a consumer perceives as similar or comparable, so that having more of one product makes them desire less of the other product. Formally, \"X\" and \"Y\" are substitutes if, when the price of \"X\" rises, the demand for \"Y\" rises.\n\nPotatoes from different farms are an example: if the price of one farm's potatoes goes up, then it can be presumed that fewer people will buy potatoes from that farm and source them from another farm instead.\n\nThere are different degrees of substitutability. For example, a car and a bicycle may substitute to some extent: if the price of motor fuel increases considerably, one may expect that some people will switch to bicycles.\n\nIn economics, one way that two or more goods can be classified is by examining the relationship of the demand schedules when the price of one good changes. This relationship between demand schedules leads to classification of goods as either substitutes or complements. Substitute goods are goods which, as a result of changed conditions, may replace each other in use (or consumption). A substitute good, in contrast to a complementary good, is a good with a positive cross elasticity of demand. This means a good's demand is increased when the price of another good is increased; both in the same direction. Conversely, the demand for a good is decreased when the price of another good is decreased. If goods A and B are substitutes, an increase in the price of A will result in a leftward movement along the demand curve of A and cause the demand curve for B to shift out. A decrease in the price of A will result in a rightward movement along the demand curve of A and cause the demand curve for B to shift in.\nExamples of substitute goods include margarine and butter, tea and coffee, beer and wine. Substitute goods not only occur on the consumer side of the market but also the producer side. Substitutable producer goods would include: petroleum and natural gas (used for heating or electricity). The degree to which a good has a perfect substitute depends on how specifically the good is defined. Take for example, the demand for Rice Krispies cereal, which is a very narrowly defined good as compared to the demand for cereal generally. The fact that one good is substitutable for another has immediate economic consequences: insofar as one good can be substituted for another, the demands for the two kinds of good will be interrelated by the fact that customers can trade off one good for the other if it becomes advantageous to do so.\n\nAn \"increase\" in price (ceteris paribus) will result in an \"increase\" in demand for its substitute goods. If two goods have a high substitutability, the change in demand will be much greater. Thus, economists can predict that a spike in the cost of a particular brand of detergent is likely to result in a large change in demand for other brands, whereas a change in the price of pencils will have a much smaller effect on the demand for other stationery, such as pens on legal documents or pencils on most high-school maths homework.\n\nIt is important to note that when speaking about substitute goods one is referring to \"two different kinds\" of goods; so the \"substitutability\" of one good for another is always a matter of degree. One good is a perfect substitute for another only if it can be used in exactly the same way. In that case the utility of a combination is an increasing function of the sum of the two amounts, and theoretically, in the case of a price difference, there would be no demand for the more expensive good.\n\nIn microeconomics, two types of substitutes are being distinguished, gross substitutes and net substitutes. Good formula_1 is said to be gross substitute of good formula_2 if\n\nGoods X and Y are said to be net substitutes if \n\nwhere formula_5 is a utility function for the two goods.\n\nSubstitutes differ with respect to their category membership. Within-category substitutes are goods that are members of the same taxonomic category, goods sharing common attributes (e.g., chocolate, chairs, station wagons, etc.). Cross-category substitutes are goods that are members of different taxonomic categories but can satisfy the same goal. A person who cannot have the chocolate that she desires, for example, might instead buy ice cream to satisfy her goal to have a dessert.\n\nGoods that are completely substitutable with each other are called perfect substitutes. They may be characterized as goods having a linear utility function or a constant marginal rate of substitution. \n\nWriteable compact disks from different manufacturers are often considered to be perfect substitutes. As the price of one brand of CD rises, consumers will be expected to substitute other brands of CD in a one-to-one fashion. This means that the total quantity of CDs purchased would not change.\n\nImperfect substitutes have a lesser level of substitutability, and therefore exhibit variable marginal rates of substitution along the consumer indifference curve. The consumption points on the curve offer the same level of utility as before but the compensation now depends on the starting point of the substitution. An example of such a product is the soft drink. As the price of Coca-Cola rises, consumers could be expected to substitute Pepsi. However, many consumers prefer one brand of soft drink over the other. Consumers who prefer Coke to Pepsi, for example, will not trade between them in a one-to-one fashion. Rather, a consumer would be willing to give relatively large amounts of Pepsi in exchange for relatively small amounts of Coke.\n\nPeople exhibit a strong preference for within-category substitutes to cross-category substitutes. Across a ten sets of different foods, a majority of research participants (79.7%) believed that a within-category substitute would better satisfy their craving for a food they could not have than a cross-category substitute. Unable to acquire a desired Godiva chocolate, for instance, a majority reported that they would prefer to eat a store-brand chocolate (a within-category substitute) than a chocolate-chip granola bar (a cross-category substitute). This preference for within-category substitutes appears, however, to be misguided. Because within-category substitutes are more similar to the missing good, their inferiority to it is more noticeable. This creates a negative contrast effect, and leads within-category substitutes to be less satisfying substitutes than cross-category substitutes.\n\nMany markets for commonly used goods feature products which are perfectly substitutable yet are differently branded and marketed, a condition referred to as monopolistic competition. A good example may be the comparison between store brand and name brand versions of medications - the products may be \"identical\" but the packaging is differentiated by the vendors. Since the goods are essentially alike, the only genuine difference between them is the price - their vendors rely primarily on price and branding to effect sales. In those sectors consumer choice is usually driven by discriminate according to \"lowest price\", with higher-priced variants relying on a sense of exclusivity created by slicker branding to maintain competitiveness.\n\n\nPerfect substitutability is significant in the era of deregulation, since there are usually several competing providers in a field (e.g. electricity suppliers) each retailing exactly the same product. The result is often aggressive price competition between the retailers.\n\nOne of the requirements for perfect competition is that the products of competing firms should be perfect substitutes. When this condition is not satisfied, the market is characterized by product differentiation.\n\n\"Unit-demand goods\" are goods from which the consumer wants only a single item. If the consumer has two items, then his utility is the \"maximum\" of the utilities he gains from each of these items. For example, consider a certain consumer that only wants a means of transportation, which may be either a car or a bicycle. His utility from a car is 100 and from a bicycle is 50. If he has both a car and a bicycle, then he uses only the car so his utility is 100. \"Unit-demand goods are always substitutes\", since if the price of one good increases, the consumer will tend to want the other good (Laizer 2016).\n\n"}

{"id": "50443206", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50443206", "title": "The Cloverfield Paradox", "text": "The Cloverfield Paradox\n\nThe Cloverfield Paradox is a 2018 American science fiction horror film directed by Julius Onah, written by Oren Uziel and Doug Jung, and produced by J. J. Abramss Bad Robot Productions. It is the third installment in the \"Cloverfield\" franchise, following \"Cloverfield\" (2008) and \"10 Cloverfield Lane\" (2016). The film stars Daniel Brühl, Elizabeth Debicki, Aksel Hennie, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Chris O'Dowd, John Ortiz, David Oyelowo and Zhang Ziyi, and follows an international group of astronauts aboard a space station who, after using a particle accelerator to try to solve Earth's energy crisis, must find a way home after accidentally traveling to an alternate dimension.\n\nThe film was based on \"God Particle\", a spec script from Oren Uziel which had the main plot of the space station crew, but was unconnected to \"Cloverfield\". The script was acquired by Paramount Pictures and Bad Robot in 2012. It had been initially planned as part of Paramount's low-budget InSurge distribution label, but following the folding of that label, its production was expanded as a Paramount-distributed film. Only during production did Abrams decide to link the film to \"Cloverfield\", adapting Uziel's screenplay and adding scenes to establish the connection, after the same approach was used to alter \"10 Cloverfield Lane\" from its original script, \"The Cellar\". Abrams saw the particle accelerator accident as a cinematic means for future events to cause changes in the past, narratively linking the \"Cloverfield\" franchise together.\n\nOnce announced as a yet-to-be-named \"Cloverfield\" film in late 2016, the film's release was delayed several times. A surprise trailer aired during Super Bowl LII on February 4, 2018, advertising the film's final title and its release on Netflix, which had purchased rights for the film from Paramount. The release occurred immediately after the game.\n\nWhile the unique marketing tactics were praised, the film itself received generally negative reviews from critics, who disliked the narrative, writing and editing, with many considering it the weakest of the \"Cloverfield\" films, although Mbatha-Raw's performance did receive some praise.\n\nIn 2028, Earth is suffering from a global energy crisis. The space agencies of the world prepare to test the Shepard particle accelerator aboard the orbiting Cloverfield Station, which would provide Earth with infinite energy, while conspiracy theorists fear it will create the \"Cloverfield Paradox\", opening portals to allow horrors from parallel universes to threaten Earth. Among the crew is Ava Hamilton, a British engineer who frets about leaving her husband Michael potentially for years, as their relationship struggles since the loss of their children to a house fire. The crew is rounded out by American commander Kiel, German physicist Ernst Schmidt, Brazilian medical doctor Monk Acosta, Irish engineer Mundy, Russian engineer Volkov, and Chinese engineer Tam.\n\nAfter about two years of unsuccessful testing of the Shepard, they eventually achieve a seemingly stable beam, but it then overloads and creates a power surge on the station. After restoring basic power, they find Earth has vanished from view, and the gyroscope that aids in the station's navigation is missing. As the crew work on repairs, strange events begin to occur, including finding an unfamiliar woman called Mina Jensen fused with wires inside a wall, whom the crew rescues. Volkov fears something crawling beneath his skin and is compelled to craft a gun using an on-board 3D printer. He uses the gun to threaten the crew, but as he does so he convulses and dies, and the station's colony of worms bursts out of him. Jensen tells Ava not to trust Schmidt, who is soon discovered to be a spy sent by the German government to keep the Shepard shut down. Mundy's arm gets pulled into a solid wall and is severed clean off, without bleeding or pain. They find the arm roaming of its own volition. When they recognize that it is trying to write something, it instructs them to \"cut Volkov open\". Once they do, they find the missing gyroscope. They quickly locate Earth and restore their communications, but transmissions state that Cloverfield Station was destroyed and fell to Earth two days prior.\n\nThe crew determine they have moved to a different universe; Jensen is found to be a crew member of the space station from this universe. Here, Hamilton's children did not die, she stayed on Earth as a civilian engineer, and Jensen replaced Tam as the station's engineer. They plan to reactivate the Shepard device to return to their own universe. While the crew repair the station, Tam works out a means to make Shepard work properly, but she is trapped in a chamber flooding with water, which later implodes and is exposed to space, killing Tam. Meanwhile, Hamilton decides to return with Jensen to Earth to be with her children. As they prepare, Mundy is killed in an explosion caused by a strange magnetic field. After the explosion, Kiel sacrifices himself to disengage the wildly-spinning maintenance ring that was jeopardizing the station, leaving Hamilton in charge.\n\nOn Earth, Michael wakes up to discover a wave of destruction ravaging the planet, witnessing the silhouette of a giant monster in the distance. On his way to offer his assistance at the local hospital, he stops to help a young girl named Molly at a dockyard. After learning that the hospital has been destroyed, he takes her to an underground shelter belonging to a friend and tends to her wounds.\n\nWith Shepard ready to activate again, Hamilton prepares to leave with Jensen, but Jensen suddenly knocks her out. Jensen kills Monk with Volkov's gun, wounds Schmidt, and insists that the station must stay in her universe to keep the Shepard device there. Regaining consciousness, Hamilton uses the gun to shoot out a window, ejecting Jensen into space. Hamilton decides to return to their universe with Schmidt and makes a recording for her alternate universe self, giving her the plans for the Shepard device and stressing the importance of her family. Hamilton and Schmidt reverse the universe shift and use Tam's modifications to finally make Shepard work. After reporting in, the two eject themselves in an evacuation capsule towards Earth.\n\nMichael learns from mission control of the station's reappearance and his wife's return to Earth, but he lambasts mission control for not warning Hamilton not to return to Earth in light of the ongoing situation. As the capsule re-enters the Earth's atmosphere, the head and torso of a giant monster burst through a layer of clouds.\n\nAdditionally, Donal Logue cameos as Mark Stambler, a conspiracy theorist discussing the \"Cloverfield Paradox\"; reviewers observed that the character shares the same surname as Howard Stambler, the conspiracy theorist portrayed by John Goodman in \"10 Cloverfield Lane\". Suzanne Cryer, who appeared as Leslie in \"10 Cloverfield Lane\", also appears in a brief cameo role as a newscaster who interviews Stambler. Simon Pegg and Greg Grunberg, both of whom have frequently worked with Abrams on other films and television series, provide vocal cameos as Radio Voice and Joe, respectively. Oyelowo and Logue previously portrayed Kiel and Stambler in the film's ARG campaign.\n\nThe film was announced in November 2012, under the title \"God Particle\", based on a script by Oren Uziel and to be directed by Julius Onah. With J.J. Abrams' Bad Robot Productions as the production studio, it was set to be released under Paramount's InSurge label, limiting the film's budget to $5–10 million. At this stage, the film was established to take place on a space station in Earth's orbit and a resulting incident that causes the crew to find Earth has gone missing. Uziel said that his script had been a spec script he wrote about one year after finishing up a similar spec script for \"Shimmer Lake\". The pick-up of the film occurred around the same time that Paramount and Bad Robot bought the rights to the spec script \"The Cellar\" by Josh Campbell and Matt Stuecken, which ultimately was reworked during production to become \"10 Cloverfield Lane\" (2016), adding in elements to tie that script to the first \"Cloverfield\" film; however, when Uziel wrote his screenplay for \"God Particle\" it had not been attached to \"Cloverfield\". When Bad Robot acquired the script, J. J. Abrams had already put some thought for how it could fit into \"Cloverfield\" but had not come up with a way prior to filming. Abrams liked that with the script, \"how something in the future could be an origin for something in the past\" to establish origin stories for the other \"Cloverfield\" works. Abrams said that the script had \"the DNA\" that made it a potential \"Cloverfield\" film, and was looking for it to be a spiritual sequel to the original.\n\nIn March 2015, Paramount decided to close the InSurge label; \"The Cellar\" had been moved under the main Paramount label, but \"God Particle\"s fate was unclear. By February 2016, Paramount confirmed it would release the film under its own label, with a planned February 2017 release date.\n\nIn March 2016, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and David Oyelowo were confirmed to be cast in the film.<ref name=\"/Film Cast\"></ref> In April, \"Variety\" reported that John Krasinski was in early talks to join the film to play one of the astronauts, but had a possible conflict due to a commitment with a television series. In May, Elizabeth Debicki, Daniel Brühl, Chris O'Dowd, Zhang Ziyi, John Ortiz, and Aksel Hennie were announced as members of the cast. Cinematographer Dan Mindel was confirmed to join the film from his résumé.\n\nThe film was shot in Los Angeles, California, where it received tax credits under the state's film incentive program. While filming in Los Angeles, the project was shot under the titles of \"God Particle\" and \"Clean Pass\". Filming began on June 10, 2016 and wrapped on September 23, 2016. According to Uziel, it was during production that he came to learn that the film was being connected to \"Cloverfield\", requiring him to rewrite a few scenes for additional shooting. Uziel speculated that the decision to connect to \"Cloverfield\" was due to the difficulty in marketing a stand-alone science-fiction film at the time, and felt the connection between the films was more of an anthology series similar to \"The Twilight Zone\", with each movie dealing with how people with complex relations deal with an other-worldly dilemma. The scenes set on Earth were added during production only after they found test audiences wanted to know what was happening on Earth during events on the space station. The final shot of the monster, similar to the creature Clover seen in the first \"Cloverfield\" movie, was a shot that the production team came to recognize as a further way to link the films. Among some of the film's Easter eggs includes a figurine of a \"Slusho!\" mascot aboard the station; the drink brand had been featured in \"Cloverfield\"s viral marketing.\n\nShortly after filming in October 2016, \"The Wrap\" learned from insiders of the connection of \"God Particle\" to \"Cloverfield\", though neither Paramount nor Bad Robot commented on this discovery. However, by December 2016, Paramount affirmed the film's connection; the title \"God Particle\" had been dropped in favor of listing the film as \"2017 \"Cloverfield\" movie\".\n\nAlongside the renaming, Paramount reslotted the film's release from February 2017 to October 2017, to give more time for post-production. The film suffered two additional delays. In July 2017, it was announced the release had been delayed another three months to February 2018. In January 2018, the release was moved for a third time, to April 20, 2018. The reason for these latter delays was not given.\n\nIn mid-January 2018, the \"Cloverfield\" alternative reality game (ARG), which had been used for both of the previous films, was relaunched, and provided some hints how this film would be tied to the other two.\n\nIn late January 2018, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" stated that Netflix was interested in picking up the film from Paramount, following a similar deal the streaming service had worked out for the film \"Annihilation\". According to the \"Reporter\", Paramount's chairman Jim Gianopulos felt the film's budget (which ballooned to over $40 million from an initial $5 million) was too large for the film to be profitable with a traditional theatrical release and that it still needed work done, and \"while Abrams expressed an intent to get down to business in post-production, it was too little, too late\". In March 2018, Paramont's COO Andrew Gumpert affirmed that Paramont, after reviewing the finished film with Abrams, had doubted the commercial viability of a theatrical release, and that \"there was an ability for us to be fiscally prudent and monetize\" by selling the rights to Netflix, exposing the film to a much larger audience. Following the film's release, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" stated that Netflix paid more than for the rights, with negotiations starting in late December 2017 and completed by mid January 2018; this offer made the film immediately profitable to Paramount. The studio retains China and home entertainment release rights. According insiders speaking to \"The Wrap\", Paramount executives believed handing off the release to Netflix was an easy way to get instant return on the film, and the surprise reveal and release a good way to keep in line with the mysterious mystique in the franchise. This said, they clarified that they still have intentions of having theatrical releases for future films in the series.\n\nAround this time, speculation of the film being named \"Cloverfield Station\" arose, though this was not confirmed by Paramount. Further speculation circulated in Hollywood sources that work on the film was actually complete and that its first trailer would be revealed soon; \"10 Cloverfield Lane\" had a similar surprise trailer.\n\nThe events of the preceding month culminated on February 4, 2018, where, during a surprise advertisement during Super Bowl LII, Netflix announced it had acquired the premiere rights for the film, now titled \"The Cloverfield Paradox\", and would be available on the service, immediately after the game. The actors themselves were not aware of this arrangement until the day of the Super Bowl and were told of the title, the advertisement, and the release that day during a morning conference call.\n\nOn November 28, 2018, Paramount announced that the film would be receiving a DVD and Blu-ray release on February 5, 2019. \n\nOn review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 17% based on 107 reviews, with an average rating of 4.5/10. The site's critical consensus states: \"Brilliant casting is overshadowed by a muddled mix of genres and storylines that scratch more heads than sci-fi itches in \"The Cloverfield Paradox\".\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 37 out of 100, based on reviews from 27 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews.\"\n\nJohn DeFire of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" called the film a \"trainwreck of a sci-fi flick bent on extending a franchise that should have died a peaceful death almost exactly one decade ago.\" Writing for Deadline Hollywood Dino-Ray Ramos said, \"The Super Bowl trailer for \"Paradox\" gave the impression the movie would reveal the origin of the monster that appeared in the 2008 movie and was later on hinted at in the critically acclaimed 2016 follow-up — but it barely did that. Instead, it stalls the franchise as a pastiche of sci-fi cinema veiled in clever marketing.\"\n\nCinemablend gave it a positive review, granting it 4 of 5 stars; the review noted that the ensemble cast \"helps keep the wheels in motion, with a perpetual motion that never lets up\", and that Ava's storyline provides a \"human anchor\" for the film's narrative.\n\nWhile the film received negative reviews, the marketing approach of announcing the film during the Super Bowl and premiering it hours later was seen as a novel move by Netflix. IGN noted that this strategy could only work for a film in an established franchise, whereas most new films would need a significant marketing period to draw in viewers. Even knowing that the film might be a critical flop, Netflix would have been able to grab attention due to hype from the Super Bowl, and attention that the \"Cloverfield\" series had already had.\n\nAccording to Nielsen ratings based on subscription video on demand, nearly 785,000 viewers watched \"The Cloverfield Paradox\" on the night of Super Bowl LII; by three days, over 2.8 million had watched it, and 5 million after a week. These ratings were not as strong as Netflix's \"Bright\", released 6 weeks earlier, which had 11 million viewers within 3 days. The film did not significantly draw viewers from the episode of \"This is Us\" on NBC after the Super Bowl game, which had been extensively marketed ahead of the night, and which drew 27 million that evening.\n\n\n"}

It was developed by Krome Studios and published by Vivendi Universal Games for the Game Boy Advance, GameCube, PlayStation 2 and Xbox. Amaze Entertainment developed the Nintendo DS version.\n\nThe game utilizes the voices of celebrities, featuring Elijah Wood as the voice of Spyro, Comedian David Spade as Sparx, Cree Summer as Cynder and Gary Oldman as Ignitus. Its success spawned two sequels and a planned CGI movie.\n\n\"The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning\" uses a more action-based focus than previous \"Spyro\" games. Rather than the previous focus on platforming, the gameplay is now more combat based. Spyro has a variety of combat moves as well as four different breath attacks: fire, electricity, ice and earth, which he can use as both long range and short range attacks. Spyro can also use furies, huge blasts of elemental energy. The game has fewer levels than previous \"Spyro\" games, with six levels that progress from a starting point towards a final destination and boss encounter in a linear fashion, and two rail shooter style flying levels adjoining them. It takes about six hours to complete the game.\n\nThe DS version has additional attacks and challenges. As well as breath attacks and furies, Spyro can create an elemental shield around himself that protects him from enemies while hurting attacking enemies. Also, the DS version has extra side missions in the form of puzzles.\n\nThe game begins inside a temple, where a large red dragon named Ignitus is watching over an egg; it is the \"Year of the Dragon\", a time every twelve years when new dragon eggs are brought to the realm. A dragons' prophecy tells that every ten generations, a rare purple dragon will be born, who will direct the fate of that era; Ignitus is looking after such an egg.\n\nThe dragons are, however, at war with an enemy known as the \"Dark Master\", who also knows of the prophecy, and lays siege to the temple, intent on destroying the brood of eggs. Ignitus escapes with the purple dragon's egg, leaving it to drift downriver into a swamp, hoping for the best. The egg is discovered by a family of dragonflies, and upon hatching, they name the dragon Spyro and adopt him into the family and raise him as one of their own, alongside Sparx, a dragonfly born the same day.\n\nOne day, after coming under attack by strange foes and discovering that he can breathe fire, Spyro is told that he is not a dragonfly himself but a stranger from a distant land; Spyro decides to leave the swamp in search of his true home; Sparx, though reluctant at first, decides to follow along. Spyro is pursued by hostile forces, but eventually comes into contact with a distraught Ignitus, who although pleased that Spyro is alive, fears that with the Dragon Temple under occupation by their enemy, led by a female dragon named Cynder (who was from the same brood of eggs, but was kidnapped) their war is already lost.\n\nSpyro convinces Ignitus to lead him to the Temple, and is able to drive Cynder's forces out, after which Ignitus tells Spyro more about their war against the dark armies, offers Spyro some training in the art of the fire element, and then sends Spyro off to rescue three other dragons from Cynder's forces. One by one, Spyro clashes with Cynder's armies, rescues the three other dragons, Volteer, Cyril, and Terrador, while acquiring new skills and training along the way. It is learned that Cynder has been draining the dragons' power into crystals.\n\nCynder, however, starts fighting Spyro who shortly after rescues the final Dragon Guardian, Terrador; Ignitus intervenes to fight Cynder but is kidnapped. It is revealed that it was the four dragons who originally sealed away the Dark Master, and that Cynder is using the dragons' drained powers to open the seal. Ignitus's power is the final key in unsealing the Dark Master, so Spyro is sent on a final, direct assault against Cynder's fortress.\n\nSpyro attempts to fight Cynder, but Cynder succeeds in draining Ignitus's power of fire into a crystal, and escapes to the sealed realm of the Dark Master. During the fight, Spyro had noticed there was something familiar in Cynder's eyes. Ignitus then tells Spyro the rest of the story of what happened the night of the attack on the temple. After sending Spyro's egg down the river, Ignitus had returned to see that the Dark Master's forces had destroyed the brood of eggs, except one - for only a dragon born in the Year of the Dragon can open the portal and release the Dark Master: Cynder, who had been transformed by the Dark Master's sinister powers. Ignitus fears that it is too late to stop her, but Spyro pursues Cynder and forces a showdown, eventually using all of his power in a final attack which defeats her, purging her of the Dark Master's influence and returning her to her true form, a young dragon the same size as Spyro. The realm begins to collapse in on itself; Sparx insists on making a quick exit but Spyro declares he will not leave Cynder behind with the Dark Master; though barely, Spyro is able to grab Cynder and escape safely.\n\nThough victorious, the battle cost Spyro much of his own strength and powers, and both Spyro and Cynder suspect that the Dark Master is still alive somewhere; the war is still far from over. The story continues in \"\".\n\nSpyro and Sparx are described as being an \"oddly-matched, yet compatible pair\". Spyro was adopted into a family of dragonflies, growing up alongside Sparx, a dragonfly born the same day. Through an ape attack, Spyro's parents tell him that he isn't a dragonfly. In fact, he is a dragon from a distant place. Learning this, Spyro set out to find this place and Sparx tagged along with him. Spyro and Sparx are voiced by Elijah Wood and David Spade.\n\nThe Dragon Guardians are a group of four elder dragons, each the master of an elemental power and who in turn teach that power to Spyro once he finds them. Ignitus, a red dragon, is very wise and is the guardian of fire. Volteer, a highly intelligent yellow dragon with a lightning fast tongue and guardian of electricity, Cyril, a sassy blue ice dragon and is the guardian of ice, and Terrador, a militant green dragon with a spike ball tail tip and is the guardian of earth. Gary Oldman voices as Ignitus, Corey Burton as Volteer, Jeff Bennett as Cyril, and Kevin Michael Richardson as Terrador.\n\nA large, powerful black dragon, Cynder serves as the primary antagonist in \"The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning\". Although born from the same batch of eggs as Spyro and in truth the same size and age as Spyro, Cynder's egg was seized by the Dark Master's forces and she was raised by them; under the influence of the Dark Master's power, Cynder grew to gigantic size and strength quickly due to the dark magic the Dark Master shrouded Cynder in, and was then able to defeat and capture the Dragon Guardians, collecting their power in order to unseal the Dark Master from imprisonment. After her defeat from Spyro, Cynder returned to her original size and strength, and was safely returned to the Dragon Temple to celebrate Spyro's victory. Cynder is voiced by Cree Summer.\n\nKrome Studios were asked by Vivendi Games to develop \"The Legend of Spyro\". After Krome showed Vivendi their technology they were using to develop a \"Crash Bandicoot\" game, Sierra asked a prototype for what subsequently became \"The Legend of Spyro\".\n\nApart from the Game Boy Advance version, \"The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning\" received fair reviews at best. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the Xbox version 71.27% and 69/100, the Nintendo DS version 68.22% and 68/100, the GameCube version 67.17% and 67/100, the PlayStation 2 version 64.52% and 64/100 and the Game Boy Advance version 44.67% and 44/100.\n\n"}
{"id": "2711926", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2711926", "title": "The Odyssey (miniseries)", "text": "The Odyssey (miniseries)\n\nThe Odyssey is a 1997 American fantasy–adventure television miniseries based on the ancient Greek epic poem by Homer, the \"Odyssey\". Directed by Andrei Konchalovsky, the miniseries aired in two parts beginning on May 18, 1997 on NBC. The series won the award for \"Outstanding Directing for a Miniseries or a Special\". It was filmed in Malta, Turkey, parts of England, and many other places around the Mediterranean, where the story takes place. The cast includes Armand Assante, Greta Scacchi, Irene Papas, Isabella Rossellini, Bernadette Peters, Eric Roberts, Geraldine Chaplin, Christopher Lee and Vanessa Williams.\n\nOdysseus (Armand Assante), the king of the ancient Greek kingdom of Ithaca, is called to service in the Trojan War after the birth of his son Telemachus, much to the dismay of his wife Queen Penelope (Greta Scacchi). Odysseus is worried that he may not return, and tells Penelope that she should remarry by the time Telemachus is a man if he does not return. The war lasts ten years, during which Greece's best soldier, Achilles (Richard Trewett), is killed and the Greeks avenge him by using a giant horse to sneak inside and destroy the city of Troy. Laocoön (Heathcote Williams) tries to warn the Trojans of a vision of this, but is suddenly devoured by a sea monster. On the way back, Odysseus' ego gets the best of him and he tells the gods that he did it himself, which angers Poseidon (voiced by Miles Anderson) so much that he promises to make Odysseus' journey home to Penelope nearly impossible, mentioning that it was he who sent the sea monster to devour Laocoön.\n\nOdysseus and his men initially stop on an island dominated by one-eyed giants, the Cyclopes. A Cyclops named Polyphemus (Reid Asato) traps them in his cave intending to eat them, but Odysseus gets him drunk on wine, causing him to pass out. Then, he sharpens a tree branch into a stake and blinds the Cyclops, allowing them to escape by hiding under sheep skins when he removes the heavy stone door. Polyphemus screams for help, but Odysseus had tricked him into stating that his name was \"Nobody\", so the Cyclops is shouting that nobody has tricked him, arousing no suspicion. Odysseus and his men escape, but Odysseus taunts the Cyclops who asks his father Poseidon to avenge him. This makes Odysseus' journey home harder.\n\nOdysseus travels to an island where Aeolus (Michael J. Pollard) provides him with a bag of wind to help him home, instructing him to open it when he gets close to Ithaca. One of his men opens it prematurely blowing them off course. Next, they stop at the island of Circe (Bernadette Peters), a beautiful witch, who turns his men into animals and blackmails him into sleeping with her. Odysseus is told of Circe's magic by Hermes (Freddy Douglas), who helps him avoid being transformed as well. Circe tells him to go to the Underworld next, and only then does Odysseus realize that he has actually been tricked by Circe, who put a spell on him so he stayed on the island for five years instead of five days. Odysseus digs his ship out of the sand and tide and sails to the Underworld.\n\nArriving at the Underworld, Tiresias (Christopher Lee) torments Odysseus, recognizing his courage and wit, but criticizes his ego and foolishness. After Odysseus sacrifices a goat into the River Styx, Tiresias tells him that the only way home will take him past a treacherous isle where the monsters Scylla and Charybdis live. As he is running in terror from the underworld, he meets his mother Anticlea (Irene Papas), who committed suicide due to the pain of losing her son. She informs him that back on Ithaca there are multiple suitors, including Eurymachus (Eric Roberts), vying with each other to marry Penelope for her money and power.\n\nOdysseus' boat nears the isle of Scylla and Charybdis. Scylla's six serpentine heads wreak havoc on the crew, killing many. Everyone but Odysseus is killed when Charybdis creates a whirlpool and destroys his ship. Odysseus arrives on the island where Calypso (Vanessa Williams) lives and becomes her prisoner. Meanwhile, Odysseus' now 15-year-old son Telemachus (Alan Stenson) tries to find his father and is told by Athena (Isabella Rossellini) to travel to Sparta and seek out one of his former comrades that fought with him. When Telemachus finds Menelaus (Nicholas Clay), one of Odysseus' comrades, he learns that he doesn't know what happened to Odysseus but believes him to be dead.\n\nTwo years later, Hermes arrives, telling Calypso to release Odysseus, and she provides him with a raft to get to Ithaca. Another storm causes problems for Odysseus as he calls out to Poseidon. Poseidon reminds Odysseus about what he said the day he left Troy, and to remember his place as a mere mortal. The next morning, Odysseus washes ashore and is found by some Phaeacians girls. With help from Phaeacian King Alcinous (Jeroen Krabbé), they help Odysseus back to Ithaca. They deliver him at night while he is fast asleep, to a hidden harbor on Ithaca. Upon awakening the next morning, he finds himself on Ithaca where is reunited with Telemachus. Using a peasant disguise provided by Athena, Odysseus meets up with Penelope where she decides to hold a contest to find the person who can string Odysseus' bow. After Odysseus wins the contest, Athena lifts his disguise and Odysseus is assisted by Telemachus in slaying Eurymachus and the suitors. Once the suitors are dead, Odysseus reunites with Penelope.\n\nThe creature effects for this miniseries were provided by Jim Henson's Creature Shop where they used a talking animatronic pig roasting on a spit, a CGI for Scylla, a rod puppet sea slug-like sea monster that devours Laocoön, and the full-bodied version of Polyphemus.\n\nThe boat used in the series was reused a few years later for the \"Jason and the Argonauts\" miniseries.\n\nMPAA rated this film PG-13 for violent sequences and some sensuality.\n\n\n"}

It is based on Michel Houellebecq's 1991 essay \"To Stay Alive\", about struggling artists, the role of the poet, and mental health problems. It features marginal artists as well as Houellebecq and the rock singer Iggy Pop, who reads from the original essay.\n\nThe director Erik Lieshout had first met Houellebecq when he interviewed him for Dutch television during the promotion of the novel \"The Possibility of an Island\", and ended up directing \"Last Words\", a behind-the-scenes documentary for Houellebecq's own film adaptation of the novel. Lieshout then asked Iggy Pop if he could possibly provide a track for the film, with little hope; but to his surprise, the singer replied very enthusiastically: in the mean time he had actually read the book (as well as a selection of Houellebecq's poetry), and loved it, finding many parallels with his own life and state of mind, to the point that it inspired him a whole album, named \"Préliminaires\", quieter than his usual output, partly sung in french, with several tracks directly related to the novel. The two artists first met in 2009, during the promotion for the album, and shared their admiration for each other's works. Indeed, Houellebecq has been a devoted fan of The Stooges since he was a teenager, contrasting with his reputation for apathy and languid intellectualism.\n\n\"To Stay Alive: A Method\" was produced by Serious Film with co-production support from AT-prod and VPRO. It was completed in April 2016.\n\nThe film was screened at the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam on 19 November 2016. It was released in Dutch cinemas on 2 February 2017.\n\n"}
{"id": "1557692", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1557692", "title": "Vietnamese phonology", "text": "Vietnamese phonology\n\nThis article is a technical description of the sound system of the Vietnamese language, including phonetics and phonology. Two main varieties of Vietnamese, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon), are described below.\n\nInitial consonants which exist only in the Hanoi dialect are in red, while those that exist only in the Saigon dialect are in blue.\n\n\n\n\nThe table below summarizes these sound correspondences:\n\nThe IPA chart of vowel nuclei above is based on the sounds in Hanoi Vietnamese; other regions may have different inventories. Vowel nuclei consist of monophthongs (simple vowels) and three centering diphthongs.\n\nIn Vietnamese, vowel nuclei are able to combine with offglides or to form closing diphthongs and triphthongs. Below is a chart listing the closing sequences of general northern speech.\n\nWhen stops occur at the end of words, they have no audible release ():\n\nWhen the velar consonants are after , they are articulated with a simultaneous bilabial closure (i.e. doubly articulated) or are strongly labialized .\n\nThe pronunciation of syllable-final \"ch\" and \"nh\" in Hanoi Vietnamese has had different analyses. One analysis, that of has them as being phonemes , where contrasts with both syllable-final \"t\" and \"c\" and contrasts with syllable-final \"n\" and \"ng\" . Final is, then, identified with syllable-initial .\n\nAnother analysis has final and as representing predictable allophonic variants of the velar phonemes and that occur after upper front vowels (orthographic ) and (orthographic ). This analysis interprets orthographic ⟨ach⟩ and ⟨anh⟩ as an underlying , which becomes phonetically open and diphthongized: → , → . This diphthongization also affects ⟨êch⟩ and ⟨ênh⟩: → , → .\n\nArguments for the second analysis include the limited distribution of final and , the gap in the distribution of and which do not occur after and , the pronunciation of ⟨ach⟩ and ⟨anh⟩ as and in certain conservative central dialects, and the patterning of ~ and ~ in certain reduplicated words. Additionally, final is not articulated as far forward as the initial : and are pre-velar with no alveolar contact.\n\nThe first analysis closely follows the surface pronunciation of a slightly different Hanoi dialect than the second. In this dialect, the in and is not diphthongized but is actually articulated more forward, approaching a front vowel . This results in a three-way contrast between the rimes \"ăn\" vs. \"anh\" vs. \"ăng\" . For this reason, a separate phonemic is posited.\n\nThe following rimes ending with velar consonants have been diphthongized in the Hanoi dialect:\n\nWith the above phonemic analyses, the following is a table of rimes ending in in the Hanoi dialect:\n\nWhile the variety of Vietnamese spoken in Hanoi has preserved finals faithfully from Middle Vietnamese, the variety spoken in Saigon has drastically changed its finals. Rimes ending in and were merged except after ; in these rimes, is the underlying phoneme while occurs after rounded vowels and occurs after front vowels . Subsequently, vowels in labial-velar rimes became diphthongized while vowels in alveolar rimes became centralizedin a similar fashion to the Hanoi dialect.\n\nThe following rimes have been diphthongized or centralized in the Saigon dialect:\n\nWith the above phonemic analyses, the following is a table of rimes ending in in the Saigon dialect:\n\nVietnamese vowels are all pronounced with an inherent tone. Tones differ in\n\n\nUnlike many Native American, African, and Chinese languages, Vietnamese tones do not rely solely on pitch contour. Vietnamese often uses instead a register complex (which is a combination of phonation type, pitch, length, vowel quality, etc.). So perhaps a better description would be that Vietnamese is a register language and not a \"pure\" tonal language.\n\nIn Vietnamese orthography, tone is indicated by diacritics written above or below the vowel.\n\nThere is much variation among speakers concerning how tone is realized phonetically. There are differences between varieties of Vietnamese spoken in the major geographic areas (northern, central, southern) and smaller differences within the major areas (e.g. Hanoi vs. other northern varieties). In addition, there seems to be variation among individuals. More research is needed to determine the remaining details of tone realization and the variation among speakers.\n\nThe six tones in the Hanoi and other northern varieties are:\n\nNgang tone:\n\n\nHuyền tone:\n\n\nHỏi tone:\n\n\nNgã tone:\n\n\nSắc tone:\n\n\nNặng tone:\n\n\nThe Southern variety is similar through all tones except for the \"nặng\" and \"ngã\" tones; the \"nặng\" tone is pronounced [˨˧], while the \"ngã\" tone is merged into the \"hỏi\" tone.\n\nNorth-central and Central Vietnamese varieties are fairly similar with respect to tone although within the North-central dialect region there is considerable internal variation.\n\nIt is sometimes said (by people from other provinces) that people from Nghệ An pronounce every tone as a nặng tone.\n\nAn older analysis assumes eight tones rather than six. This follows the lead of traditional Chinese phonology. In Middle Chinese, syllables ending in a vowel or nasal allowed for three tonal distinctions, but syllables ending with , or had no tonal distinctions. Rather, they were consistently pronounced with a short high tone, which was called the entering tone and considered a fourth tone. Similar considerations lead to the identification of two additional tones in Vietnamese for syllables ending in , , and . These are not phonemically distinct from the \"sắc\" and \"nặng\" tones, however, and hence not considered as separate tones by modern linguists and are not distinguished in the orthography.\n\nAccording to , there are 4,500 to 4,800 possible spoken syllables (depending on dialect), and the standard national orthography (\"Quốc Ngữ\") can represent 6,200 syllables (\"Quốc Ngữ\" orthography represents more phonemic distinctions than are made by any one dialect). A description of syllable structure and exploration of its patterning according to the Prosodic Analysis approach of J.R. Firth is given in Henderson (1966).\n\nThe Vietnamese syllable structure follows the scheme:\n\nwhere\n\nIn other words, a syllable has an obligatory nucleus and tone, and can have an optional consonant onset, an optional on-glide , and an optional coda or off-glide.\n\nMore explicitly, the syllable types are as follows:\n\nC: Any consonant may occur in as an onset with the following exceptions:\n\nw: the onglide (sometimes transcribed instead as labialization on a preceding consonant):\n\n\nV: The vowel nucleus V may be any of the following 14 monophthongs or diphthongs: .\n\nG: The offglide may be or . Together, V and G must form one of the diphthongs or triphthongs listed in the section on Vowels.\n\nC: The optional coda C is restricted to labial, coronal, and velar stops and nasals , which cannot cooccur with the offglides .\n\nT: Syllables are spoken with an inherent tone contour:\n\nBelow is a table comparing four linguists' different transcriptions of Vietnamese vowels as well as the orthographic representation. Notice that this article mostly follows , with the exception of marking short vowels short.\n\nAnother thing to mention about Han's studies is that she uses a rather small number of participants and, additionally, although her participants are native speakers of the Hanoi variety, they all have lived outside of Hanoi for a significant period of their lives (e.g. in France or Ho Chi Minh City).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "300591", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=300591", "title": "Whale watching", "text": "Whale watching\n\nWhale watching is the practice of observing whales and dolphins (cetaceans) in their natural habitat. Whale watching is mostly a recreational activity (cf. birdwatching), but it can also serve scientific and/or educational purposes. A study prepared for International Fund for Animal Welfare in 2009 estimated that 13 million people went whale watching globally in 2008. Whale watching generates $2.1 billion per annum in tourism revenue worldwide, employing around 13,000 workers. The size and rapid growth of the industry has led to complex and continuing debates with the whaling industry about the best use of whales as a natural resource.\n\nOrganized whale watching started in the United States, when the Cabrillo National Monument in San Diego was declared a public venue for observing the migration of Gray Whales; the spectacle attracted 10,000 visitors in its first year, 1950. In 1955 the first water-based whale watching commenced in the same area, charging customers $1 per trip to view the whales at closer quarters. The industry spread throughout the western coast of the United States over the following decade.\n\nIn 1971 the Montreal Zoological Society commenced the first commercial whale watching activity on the eastern side of North America, offering trips in the St. Lawrence River to view Fin and Beluga Whales.\n\nIn 1984, Erich Hoyt, who had spent much time amongst the Orcas of British Columbia, published the first comprehensive book on whale watching, \"The Whale Watcher's Handbook\", which Mark Carwardine called his number one \"natural classic\" book in \"BBC Wildlife\" Magazine.\n\nBy 1985 more visitors watched whales from New England than California. The rapid growth in this area has been attributed to the relatively dense population of Humpback Whales, whose acrobatic behavior such as breaching (jumping out of the water) and tail-slapping thrilled observers, and the close proximity of whale populations to the large cities there.\n\nWhale watching tourism has grown substantially since the mid-1980s. The first worldwide survey of whale watching was conducted by Hoyt for the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society (WDCS) in 1992. It was updated in 1995 and submitted by the UK government to the International Whaling Commission (IWC) meetings as a demonstration of the value of living whales. In 1999, the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) asked Hoyt for another expansion, which was published in 2001. In 2009 the survey was completed by a team of economists and this report estimated that in 2008, 13 million people went whale watching, up from 9 million ten years earlier. Commercial whale watching operations were found in 119 countries. Direct revenue of whale watching trips was estimated at US$872.7 million and indirect revenue of $2,113.1 million was spent by whale watchers in tourism-related businesses.\n\nWhale watching is of particular importance to developing countries. Coastal communities have started to profit directly from the whales' presence, significantly adding to popular support for the protection of these animals from commercial whaling and other threats such as bycatch and ship strikes using the tool of marine protected areas and sanctuaries. In 2007, the Humane Society International sponsored a series of workshops to introduce whale watching to coastal Peru and commissioned Hoyt to write a blueprint for high quality, sustainable whale watching. This manual, later translated into Spanish, French, Indonesian, Japanese, Chinese and Dutch, with co-sponsorship from WDCS, IFAW and Global Ocean was updated in English in 2012 in ebook form.\n\nThe rapid growth of the number of whale watching trips and the size of vessel used to watch whales may affect whale behavior, migratory patterns and breeding cycles. There is now strong evidence that whale watching can significantly affect the biology and ecology of whales and dolphins.\n\nEnvironmental campaigners, concerned by what they consider the \"quick-buck\" mentality of some boat owners, continue to strongly urge all whale watcher operators to contribute to local regulations governing whale watching (no international standard set of regulations exist because of the huge variety of species and populations). Common rules include:\n\n(Source: WDCS)\n\nIn Uruguay, where whales can be watched from the beach, legislators have designated the country's territorial waters as a sanctuary for whales and dolphins. It is illegal to be more than 300 metres from a whale.\n\nWhale watching tours are available in various locations and climates. By area, they are:\n\nIn South Africa, the town of Hermanus is one of the world centers for whale watching. Between May and December southern right whales come so close to the Cape shoreline that visitors can watch whales from their hotels. The town employs a \"whale crier\" (cf town crier) to walk through the town announcing where whales have been seen.\n\nYou can watch the whales in Hermanus from the cliff tops, from a boat or the air. Boat-based whale watching tours are available out of the Hermanus New harbour which allows the public to view southern right whales from June till Mid December. Port Elizabeth runs a boat-based whale watching tour out of the Port Elizabeth harbour which allows the public to view southern right whales from July to November, humpback whales from June to August and November to January, and Bryde's whales all year round, up-close. Visitors can also see humpback whales from the lighthouse at Cape Recife (the Westerly point of Algoa Bay), and southern right whales from viewing points along the coast. Boat-based whale watching (and dolphin watching) is also a popular tourist attraction in a number of other coastal towns in South Africa, such as Plettenberg Bay, where the industry is linked to conservation and education efforts through Plettenberg Bay-based volunteer marine conservation organisations. Plettenberg Bay is visited by southern right whales in the winter months and humpback whales in the summer months. Bryde's whales are resident throughout the year. The other famous centre for whale watching is False Bay. Tours leave Gordon's Bay and follow the coast around the bay. Species include southern right whales, humpback whales and Bryde's whales. Orcas are present during the winter months. Visitors include pilot whales and pygmy sperm whales. Many species of dolphin are encountered including Haveside dolphins. The same tours include great white sharks at Seal Island and the African Penguin Colony at Simon's Town.\n\nIn Brazil, humpbacks are observed off Salvador in Bahia State and at the National Marine Park of Abrolhos during their breeding season in austral winter and spring. Likewise, southern right whales are observed from shore in Santa Catarina State and Espírito Santo during the same season. Mother/calf pairs can come as close to shore as 30 meters (about 100 feet). Income from whale watching bolsters coastal communities and has made the township of Imbituba, the Brazilian \"whale capital\".\n\nIn Argentina, Península Valdés in Patagonia hosts (in winter) the largest breeding population of southern right whales, with more than 2,000 catalogued by the Whale Conservation Institute and Ocean Alliance. The region contains six natural reserves, and is considered to be one of the premier whale watching destinations in the world, particularly around the town of Puerto Pirámides and the city of Puerto Madryn, as the whales come within of the main beach and play a major part in the large ecotourism industry in the region.\n\nIn Uruguay, southern right whales are observable from the beach in two coastal departments – Maldonado and Rocha from June to November. The points where most sightings in Maldonado are made are Punta Colorada, Punta Negra, Playa Mansa and Punta Salinas in Punta del Este, and in Rocha off La Paloma and La Pedrera beaches.\n\nIn Western Australia, whales are watched near Cape Naturaliste in the south-east Indian Ocean and at Cape Leeuwin where the Indian and Southern Oceans meet.\n\nIn the Southern Ocean there are many spots to see whales, both from land or aboard ship. Albany on the south coast of Western Australia the town where the last land based whaling station in the southern hemisphere was located is now home to a thriving whale watching industry. In Victoria a popular site is Logan's Beach at Warrnambool, as well as in the waters off Port Fairy and Portland. In Tasmania whales can be seen all along the east coast and even on the River Derwent. In South Australia whales are watched in the Great Australian Bight Marine Park areas and closer to Adelaide at Victor Harbor.\n\nIn eastern Australia, whale watching occurs in many spots along the Pacific coast. From headlands, whales may often be seen making their migration south. At times, whales even make it into Sydney Harbour.\n\nNew South Wales National Parks and Wildlife took an active role in 2010 during the peak southern whale watching season between May and November with the launch of its whale watching site.\n\nIn Colombia, the towns of Bahía Solano and Nuquí are visited by a large number of Humpback whales from late July to the beginning of October. In southern Costa Rica, Marino Ballena National Park has two seasons when whales visit.\n\nIn Panama, the Pearl Islands archipelago receive an estimated 300 humpbacks whale from late June to late November. These had become now the main attraction for whale watching tours starting in Panama City. In the Gulf of Chiriqui, the World Heritage Site of Coiba Island National Park and the islands near the town of Boca Chica are offering opportunities for whale watching. Isla Iguana near Pedasi is now a popular destination for whale watchers. Several foundations train local community members to perform as guide and captains for whale watching tours.\n\nIn Ecuador, from June to September, there are many sites from which large groups of humpback whales can be seen, including Isla de la Plata (AKA Little Galapagos) and Salinas, at the tip of the Santa Elena Peninsula.\n\nTidal straits, inlets, lagoons, and varying water temperatures provide diverse habitats for multiple cetacean species. Substantial numbers live off the coasts of Great Britain, Ireland, Iceland, Scandinavia, Portugal, Spain, and France. Commercial car ferries crossing the Bay of Biscay from Britain and Ireland to Spain and France often pass by enormous blue whales and much smaller harbor porpoise. Land-based tours can often view these animals.\n\nChanonry Point is one of the best spots in the UK to view Bottlenose dolphin \"Tursiops truncatus\". The dolphins are visible from the shore, particularly on an incoming tide when they play and fish in the strong currents. Other wildlife, including porpoises and grey seals, can also regularly be spotted.\n\nOff the south coast of Ireland, humpback whales and fin whales are regularly seen on organized whale watching trips between July and February. Species seen all year include minke whales, common dolphins, bottlenose dolphins, Risso's dolphins, Orcas and harbour porpoises. There is also a resident group of bottlenose dolphins in the Shannon Estuary which attracts tourists all year round.\n\nIn northern Norway (Nordland and Troms) orcas are visible in the Vestfjorden, Tysfjorden, Ofotfjorden and Andfjorden as the herring gathers in the fjords to stay over the winter and off the Lofoten islands during the summer. At Andenes on Andøya in Vesterålen and around Krøttøya in Troms, sperm whales can be observed year round, summer whale watching trips occur from May till September, winter trips with killer whales and humpback whales are offered from October till April. Tromsø also offers whale watching for sperm whales and other whales. The continental shelf Eggakanten and deep water where the sperm whales congregate, is very close to shore, beginning only from the Andenes harbour.\n\nIn Portugal whale watching is available in the Algarve. Lagos and Portimão are the most important whale watching places. The species observed in this area are: bottlenose dolphin, common dolphin, striped dolphin, pilot whale, fin whale and orca.\n\nIn the middle of the Northeast Atlantic, around the Madeira, the Azores and the Cape Verde archipelagos, whale watching is on the increase and popular due to more protection and education. One of the most common whales in these regions is the sperm whale, especially groups of calving females.\n\nIn Spain whale watching is available along the Strait of Gibraltar, the Canary Islands, and in the Bay of Biscay. Tarifa is the most important whale watching town in the Strait of Gibraltar; this gateway to the Mediterranean Sea is also a central point in between the colder waters to the North and the tropical waters off of Africa: a good route for migrating cetaceans. The species observed in this area are: bottlenose dolphin, common dolphin, striped dolphin, pilot whale, sperm whale, fin whale and orca.\n\nIn the Canary Islands it is possible to see these and others, such as the blue whale, Bryde's whale, beaked whale, false killer whale, Risso's dolphin, Atlantic spotted dolphin and rough-toothed dolphin.\n\nIn Iceland it is possible to see whales in Eyjafjörður, Breiðafjörður, Skjálfandi and Faxaflói. The towns offering whale watching are Dalvík, Hauganes, Húsavík, Akureyri, Hólmavík, Grundarfjörður and Reykjavík. Most common are minke whale, humpback whale, white-beaked dolphin, blue whale, Killer Whale, Sperm Whale and harbour porpoise.\n\nIn New England and off the east coast of Long Island in the United States, the whale watching season typically takes place from about mid-spring through October, depending both on weather and precise location. It is here that the humpback whale, fin whale, minke whale, and the very endangered/heavily protected North Atlantic right whale are often observed. For generations, areas like the Gulf of Maine and Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary (part of the inner waters formed by Cape Cod's hooked shape) have been important feeding grounds for these species: to this day a very large portion of the waters off the Eastern Seaboard are rich in sand lance and other nutritious treats for mothers to teach their calves to feed on.\n\nIn the past this area was the US whaling industry's capital, particularly Nantucket, an island just off the coast of Massachusetts. Though strict laws prohibit molestation of these large wild mammals, it is not unknown for the whales to approach whale watching boats uninvited, particularly curious calves and juveniles: it is not unknown in particular, for example, for juvenile humpbacks to approach the boat and spyhop to get a better look at the humans aboard. In recent years it is also not uncommon to see these animals playing and feeding in harbors, including New York City or Boston where fish species of interest to the whales have lately returned in astonishing numbers. As of 2011, an expert from Cornell University has recorded the vocalizations of six whale species including the humpback, the fin whale, and the massive blue whale within close proximity of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in the lower portion of New York Harbor and there is at least one company offering marine life tours out of The Rockaway Peninsula in Queens. Due to these increasingly frequent visits, new laws address the safety of boaters, commercial fishermen, and the whales themselves: off the coast of Boston, for example, cargo vessels must slow down to protect the much slower North Atlantic right whale and there is talk of erecting an apparatus for the much more heavily trafficked waters surrounding New York City that can warn boats of a whale's presence and location so as to avoid accidentally striking the animal. Because of the relative diversity of whales and dolphins within easy access of shore, cetacean research takes place at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, and the Riverhead Foundation among other centers.\nEastern Canada has many whale watching tours in Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia or New Brunswick. Twenty-two species of whales and dolphins frequent the waters of Newfoundland and Labrador, although the most common are the humpback, minke, fin, Beluga and killer whales. Another popular whale-watching area is at Tadoussac, Quebec, where Belugas favor the extreme depth and admixture of cold fresh water from the Saguenay River into the inland end of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. Humpbacks, minkes, fin and blue whales are also frequently seen off Tadoussac.The Bay of Fundy is an equally important feeding ground for large baleen whales and dozens of other creatures of the sea; it shares a population of migrating humpbacks with America and is a known summer nursery for mother right whales with calves.\n\nOn the east coast of the United States, Virginia Beach, Virginia whale watching is a winter activity from the end of December until the middle of March. Fin, humpback, and right Whales are seen off the Virginia Beach coast on whale watching boat trips run by the Virginia Aquarium and Marine Science Center. Sightings are mostly of juveniles who stay near the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay where food is plentiful, while the adults continue to the Caribbean to mate. \"Mom\" and \"Dad\" pick up their offspring on the way back north where the whole family summers.\n\nEcotourism based on kayak trips is gaining in popularity in warm-water vacation destinations such as Sarasota Keys. Guided kayak trips take kayakers on a tour of the local ecosystem. Kayakers can watch dolphins breach and manatees eat sea grass, in shallow bay water.\n\nThe waters surrounding Virginia are also a known migration corridor for the endangered North Atlantic right whale: Pregnant females must pass through this area around December to reach their birthing grounds down the coast in Georgia and Florida. For these reasons the waters between the Delmarva Peninsula and the barrier islands that stretch southwards towards northern Florida must be monitored every winter and spring as mothers give birth to their calves, nurse them, and then ready themselves and their younglings to return north for the cooler waters near New England and Canada.\n\nAbout 25 species are observed in the Caribbean waters such as Humpback whales, Sperm whales, beaked whales and many other small cetaceans. Principle whale watch activities : Dominican Republic, East Caribbean islands. Caribwhale, the Caribbean whale watch association, include operators engaged in a sustainable whale watching activity, experts, conservationists and research groups as the International Fund for Animal Welfare, Dalhousie University and Association Evasion Tropicale.\n\nOn the South and East Coasts of Sri Lanka and The Maldives, the industry is growing. During winter and summer, sperm whales cross the southern tip of the island, migrating to the warmer waters of Southeast Asia. So do pygmy blue whales.\n\nMany pygmy blue whales can be seen at Dondra point in Sri Lanka. You can access it through the Mirissa Harbour or Weligama Harbour. Whale watching tours can be arranged via many in Sri Lanka.\n\nThe sea of Mirissa is the place where you can see blue whales and few types of dolphins while travelling in Sri Lanka. Many sightings have been reported in November to April in the year.\n\nOn the West Coast of Canada and the United States, excellent whale watching can be found in Alaska (summer), British Columbia, and the San Juan Islands/Puget Sound in Washington, where orca pods are sometimes visible from shore. Three types of orca pods can be observed during the summer months in the Northeast Pacific: resident, transient, and offshore killer whales. \n\nOn the Oregon Coast, several whale species, especially gray whales, may be seen year-round, and the state trains volunteers to assist tourists in the winter months, during whale migration season. In California, good whale-watching can be found year-round on the Southern California coast. During the winter and spring (December–May), gray whales can be seen from shore on their annual migration (the best spot being Point Vicente), while blue whales are often seen between July and October. Fin whales, minke whales, orcas, and various species of dolphins can be seen year-round. In spring, summer, and fall at the Farallon Islands off San Francisco, one may see humpbacks, grays, and blue whales. \n\nIn Mexico, the various lagoons of Baja California Sur become breeding habitat for gray whales in February and March.\nHumpback whales can be seen off the southern tip of Baja California, and off Puerto Vallarta in Jalisco on the west coast of Mexico, and Barra de Potosi on the south coast of Mexico in the state of Guerrero.. A number of towns in Mexico celebrate the whale's arrival with festivals such as Guerrero Negro, in the first half of February and the port of San Blas on 24 and 25 February.\n\nEach winter 4,000 to 10,000 North Pacific humpback whales migrate from Alaska to Hawaii. In the vast waters that line Alaska's coast, an encounter with a whale is likely, if not downright predictable. In the summer, after thousands of whales have made their way to the rich feeding grounds of Alaska waters, sightings are extremely common. Whale watching is possible within as well as outside the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary. The best places to see whales in Hawaiʻi is in the protected channels between the Hawaiʻian islands. The best months to see the whales here are January and February when you can expect to see between 2 and 4 whales per 15 minute period, although fluctuations between 0 and 20 sightings are normal.\n\nMany countries in Asia have large whale watching industries. In 2008 the largest, in terms of number of tourists, were mainland China, Taiwan and Japan. India, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, the Philippines and the Maldives also have dolphin watching and some whale watching. China’s dolphin watching is almost entirely focussed on Sanniang Bay in Guangxi. Taiwan has several whale watching ports on its east coast. Japan has a range of whale and dolphin watching businesses on all main islands and Okinawa, Zamami, Ogasawara, Mikura-Jima and Miyake-jima.\n\nIn the Philippines, over thirty species of whales and dolphins can be observed around Pamilacan in Central Visayas, Davao Gulf, the northern coast of the province-island Babuyan Islands in Batanes, Pasaleng Bay, and Malampaya Sound, Palawan. The Visayas is particularly known area for dolphin sightings, and is home to one of the larger populations of the Fraser's dolphin in the world. Dolphin species in the Visayas are attracted to fish lures and to commercial fishing operations. In the northernmost province of Batanes, at least 12 species of whales and dolphins has been sighted, making it the single location in the country with the highest cetacean diversity. There seems to be no specific whale watching season in the Philippines, although the calmer waters of the summer season typically provides the best conditions. Some populations, like those of the Irrawaddy dolphin, Bryde's whale, and humpback whales in Batanes, appear migratory. Other populations have yet to be studied. Some former coastal whaling communities in the Philippines have also started to generate whale watching income.\n\nIn Indonesia, whale sharks can be observed in Nabire of Papua region.\n\nKaikoura in New Zealand is a world-famous whale-watching site. The sea around Kaikoura supports an abundance of sea life, with the town's income stemming largely from the tourism generated from whale watching and swimming with or around dolphins. Recently the sperm whale watching at Kaikoura has developed rapidly and now it is an industry leader, arguably the most developed in the world. The town went into recession after the collapse of whaling in New Zealand. Its recent development has been used to advocate the benefits of watching whales instead of hunting them.\n\nThe Sunshine Coast and Hervey Bay (where the whales stay and rest before migrating) in Queensland, Australia offer reliable whale watching conditions for southern humpback whales from the end of June through to the end of November each year. Whale numbers and activity have increased markedly in recent years. Sydney, Eden, Port Stephens, Narooma and Byron Bay in New South Wales are other popular hot spots for tours from May to November.\n\nSouthern right whales are seen June–August along the south coast of Australia. They are often readily viewed from the coast around Encounter Bay near Victor Harbor and up to a hundred at a time may be seen from the cliff tops at the head of the Great Australian Bight near Yalata. See also Whaling in Australia.\n\nIn the Pelagos Sanctuary for Mediterranean Marine Mammals, located in the waters of Italy, France and Monaco, there are eight species of marine mammals residents, most of them all year. Frequent summer excursions depart from the ports of Genoa and Imperia, in Liguria, Northern Italy.\n\nThe three biggest whaling nations (Canada, Greenland and Norway) have growing whale watching industries. The next four whaling nations (Japan, USA, Russia and Iceland) also have whale watching industries. Indeed, Iceland had the fastest-growing whale watching industry in the world between 1994 and 1998.\n\nWhale watching and hunting take place in different regions of Canada. Whale watching happens in the Saint Lawrence River, western Hudson's Bay near Churchill, and British Columbia. Hunting takes place in eastern Hudson's Bay (Nunavik, Quebec), Nunavut and the Beaufort Sea. Researchers have suggested the hunting areas would benefit more from whale watching than hunting, since hunting takes more resources than it earns.\n\nGreenland has small whale watching operations in Disko Bay and Nuuk. Both areas have beluga hunts. There has been controversy over who is allowed to participate in hunts and consume the meat.\n\nEnjoyment of observing live cetaceans is rather separated from the domestic whaling industry in Norway; however, whale watching has become a popular national tourist attraction in recent years, especially in Andfjorden (Vesterålen and Troms) and around Tromsø.\n\nErich Hoyt and other conservationists argue that a whale is worth more alive and watched than dead. The goal is to persuade their governments to curtail whaling activities. This debate continues at the International Whaling Commission, particularly since whaling countries complain that the scarcity of whale meat and other products has increased their value. However, the whale meat market has collapsed, and in Japan the government subsidizes the market through distribution in schools and other promotion. In 1997, 2,000 tonnes of whale meat were sold for $30m – a 10-tonne Minke Whale would thus have been worth $150,000. There is no agreement as to how to value a single animal although its true value is probably much higher. However, it is clear from most coastal communities that are involved in whale watching that profits can be made and are more horizontally distributed throughout the community than if the animals were killed by the whaling industry.\n\nRussian whale watching involves orcas off the Kamchatka peninsula on the edge of the Sea of Okhotsk.\n\nBeluga are hunted in the Sea of Okhotsk as well as farther north. Erich Hoyt of the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society has identified other places in Russia to develop whale watching.\n\nUpon the resumption of whaling in Iceland in August 2003, pro-whaling groups, such as fishermen who argue that increased stocks of whales deplete fish populations, suggested that sustainable whaling and whale watching could live side-by-side. Whale watching lobbyists, such as Húsavík Whale Museum curator Asbjorn Bjorgvinsson, counter that the most inquisitive whales, which approach boats very closely and provide much of the entertainment on whale-watching trips, will be the first to be taken. Pro-whaling organisations such as the High North Alliance on the other hand, claim that some whale-watching companies in Iceland are surviving only because they receive funding from anti-whaling organizations.\n\nIn comparison, the government of the Azores has promoted an economic policy centred on tourism that includes whale watching. With the decline of whaling in the early 1970s in the islands, many of the communities of the archipelago involved in whaling (including villages and towns, specifically on the islands of Faial, Terceira, São Miguel and Pico) were transformed into hubs for whale watching services (that followed the migratory tracts during the summer), while older buildings and factories were re-purposed into museums.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7215432", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7215432", "title": "Wolves Eat Dogs", "text": "Wolves Eat Dogs\n\nWolves Eat Dogs is a crime novel by Martin Cruz Smith, set in Russia and Ukraine in the year 2004. It is the fifth novel to feature Investigator Arkady Renko and the first one taking place in Russia during the new, independent (post-Soviet) era.\n\nRussia has changed from a Communist to capitalist state, and Ukraine has seceded from the former Soviet Union. When Pavel \"Pasha\" Ivanov, one of the leading members of Russia's new billionaire class, dies in an apparent suicide, Renko investigates. Pasha fell from the balcony of his penthouse apartment, and all the signs point to his having been alone at the time. The only anomaly is a large mound of table salt in the victim's wardrobe.\n\nDespite interference from his own boss as well as from other persons of power, Renko continues his investigation by questioning Pasha's friends and associates. There is apparently some kind of dark secret in Ivanov's past, and Pasha was always very depressed around May Day. Just before he is forcefully removed from the investigation, Arkady returns alone to Pasha's apartment and reconstructs his movements on the night he died. In the drawer of his bureau, Arkady finds a radiation dosimeter wrapped in a blood-stained handkerchief. Turning it on, he finds that the entire apartment is radioactive, the highest levels coming from the mound of salt. Arkady concludes that Ivanov did indeed commit suicide but that it was under a form of duress. A HazMat team re-examines the apartment and Pasha's body and finds that the salt was mixed with a small quantity of cesium chloride, identical in appearance to table salt but lethally radioactive. After confirming that his apartment was filled with radiation, Ivanov swallowed a large quantity of the salt before jumping, in an attempt to protect anyone entering the apartment later. \n\nA week after Arkady's discovery, Pasha's business partner Timofeyev is found murdered near Pripyat, Ukraine, in the \"dead zone\" around the site of the Chernobyl disaster. Arkady's superior, exasperated at his insubordination, posts him to Ukraine to \"investigate\" this murder with neither assistance nor resources. He makes the acquaintance of the colorful local community: a team of radiobiologists, various foreign scientists, and a small group of peasant squatters who refuse to leave the area despite the official evacuation. Arkady also becomes the lover of Eva Kazka, a medical doctor assigned to the scientific community. Eva confides to him that she was rendered infertile and also suffered a long series of operable cancers as a result of exposure to radioactive fallout that blanketed Kiev while she was marching in a May Day parade after the meltdown.\n\nEva's ex-husband, Alex Gerasimov, the leader of the radiobiology team, kidnaps Arkady and reveals himself to be the culprit, explaining his motives with relish: Ivanov and Timofeyev were the favorite pupils of Alex's father, Felix Gerasimov, the Soviet Union's leading authority on nuclear accidents. When the Central Committee telephoned Gerasimov to ask what to do about the meltdown, Gerasimov was too drunk to respond, so Ivanov and Timofeyev took the call, pretending to be relaying Gerasimov's instructions. Based on what the Committee told them, Ivanov and Timofeyev decided that it was unnecessary to either evacuate Pripyat or to cancel the May Day celebrations in Kiev. In other words, Ivanov and Timofeyev were ambitious men who reacted to a crisis the way ambitious men do: by covering up for their boss, and by telling the men in charge what they want to hear - and by doing so, they allowed millions of civilians (including Eva) to be exposed to the fallout. Gerasimov remained untouched by the scandal but later committed suicide.\n\nWhile Alex admits that Ivanov and Timofeyev were not solely responsible for the disaster, he felt they should be held accountable to some degree. He planted tiny grains of cesium on their clothes and persons, tormenting them before administering fatal doses. He even offered to stop if Ivanov and Timofeyev would return to Chernobyl and admit their responsibility, but \"they were too ashamed to save their own lives.\" After Ivanov's death, Timofeyev tried to save himself by returning to the scene of his crime, though Alex says he doesn't know who murdered him. Having killed his assistants in cold blood, Alex prepares to kill Arkady to cover his tracks when he is shot down by the vengeful sister of one of the assistants. \n\nArkady reports that Pasha's case has been solved, though the murders of Timofeyev and Alex Gerasimov remain open. He is recalled to Moscow. Eva leaves with him, and the couple adopt an orphaned boy named Zhenya whom Arkady has been mentoring at a local shelter.\n\nA few months later, they make a one-day trip back to Pripyat to visit some of their local friends, an elderly farmer couple who have lived in the same place all their lives, and whose grandchildren died from radiation poisoning. Seeing the husband, Roman, slaughter a pig in almost exactly the same way as Timofeyev was killed, Arkady and Eva realize that it was Roman who killed Timofeyev, and why, but refrain from reporting it to the authorities.\n\nThere are a number of possible interpretations of the title:\n\n\n"}
