The 1910s represented the culmination of European militarism which had its beginnings during the second half of the 19th century. The conservative lifestyles during the first half of the decade, as well as the legacy of military alliances, was forever changed by the assassination, on June 28, 1914, of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne. The murder triggered a chain of events in which, within 33 days, World War I broke out in Europe on August 1, 1914. The conflict dragged on until a truce was declared on November 11, 1918, leading to the controversial, one-sided Treaty of Versailles, which was signed on June 28, 1919.\n\nThe war's end triggered the abdication of various monarchies and the collapse of five of the last modern empires of Russia, Germany, China, Ottoman Turkey and Austria-Hungary, with the latter splintered into Austria, Hungary, southern Poland (who acquired most of their land in a war with Soviet Russia), Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, as well as the unification of Romania with Transylvania and Moldavia. However, each of these states (with the possible exception of Yugoslavia) had large German and Hungarian minorities, creating some unexpected problems that would be brought to light in the next two decades. \"(See Dissolution of Austro-Hungarian Empire: Successor States for better description of composition of names of successor countries/states following the splinter.)\"\n\nThe decade was also a period of revolution in a number of countries. The Portuguese 5 October 1910 revolution, which ended the 8 century long monarchy, spearheaded the trend, followed by the Mexican Revolution in November 1910, which led to the ousting of dictator Porfirio Diaz, developing into a violent civil war that dragged on until mid-1920, not long after a new Mexican Constitution was signed and ratified. The Russian Empire also had a similar fate, since its participation on World War I led it to a social, political and economical collapse which made the tsarist autocracy unsustainable and, as a following of the events of 1905, culminated in the Russian Revolution and the establishment of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, under the direction of the Bolshevik Party later renamed as Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The Russian Revolution of 1917, known as the October Revolution, was followed by the Russian Civil War, which dragged on until approximately late 1922.\n\nMuch of the music in these years was ballroom-themed. Many of the fashionable restaurants were equipped with dance floors. Prohibition in the United States began January 16, 1919, with the ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n\n\n\n\nProminent assassinations, targeted killings, and assassination attempts include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 1913 Armory Show in New York City was a seminal event in the history of Modern Art. Innovative contemporaneous artists from Europe and the United States exhibited together in a massive group exhibition in New York City, and Chicago.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following articles contain brief timelines which list the most prominent events of the decade:\n\n1910 • 1911 • 1912 • 1913 • 1914 • 1915 • 1916 • 1917 • 1918 • 1919\n\n"}

Founded by public figure, producer and director Sadyk Sher-Niyaz in 2001 in the capital of Bishkek, the structure of the Fund consists of the Union of Improvised Singing ‘Aitysh’, Film Production Company ‘Aitysh Film’, International Film Festival \"Kyrgyzstan - Land of Short Films\", Manas Cinema network and Literary Organization ‘Kalemger’.\n\nThe idea of creating Aitysh Public Fund was born in 1998 as at this time the art of traditional improvised singing was poorly developed throughout the country.\n\nIn 2001, Sadyk Sher-Niyaz established the Fund to support young singing improvisers and to restore the former greatness of this traditional art known as ‘Aitysh’. Together with such well-known singing improvisers as Ashyraly Aytaliev, and Tuuganbay Abdiev, Sadyk Sher-Niyaz established a school for young singing improvisers. By 2014, the school had approximately 30 students.\n\nIn 2003, the singing improvisers were included in the UNESCO List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. The Head of UNESCO, Kōichirō Matsuura, gave special thanks to the founder, Sadyk Sher-Niyaz, for his contribution to world culture.\n\nIn 2004, the Russian NTV television channel devoted a programme to Aitysh Public Fund and the art of improvised singing and in 2005, the largest US newspaper ‘The Washington Post’ published an article about this tradition.\n\nThe Fund has helped to establish new, talented singing improvisers such as Amantay Kutmanaliev, Jenishbek Toktobek, Elmirbek Imanaliev, Aaly Tutkuchev, Azamat Bolgonbaev. In addition, the Fund has contributed to the resumption of cultural unity between Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan through international competitive concerts.\n\nLater Aitysh Public Fund started to promote the development of other spheres of Kyrgyz culture and from 2004 to launch new cultural projects.\n\nSince 2001, Aitysh Public Fund has organized and sponsored:\n\n\nThe fund also supports the release, presentation and distribution of publications, video and audio materials, the authors of which include singing improvisers and others.\n\nIn 2004, due to the large interest in the art of improvised singing among the population, the first public TV channel Public Television Radio Corporation (PTRC) and the second channel ElTR began live broadcasts of the competitive concerts.\n\nRegular partners include the Ministry of Culture of the Kyrgyz Republic, International Humanitarian Cooperation Fund, , Kyrgyzfilm and International PEN.\n\nIn 2001, in order to promote the development of the traditional art of improvised singers, Sadyk Sher-Niyaz founded a school for young singing improvisers.\n\nIn December 2004, he also founded the literary organization ‘Kalemger’. The purpose of the organization is to support young, talented writers in Kyrgyzstan. Several collections of member’s work have been released, as well as dozens of periodic anthologies.\n\nIn 2006, Sadyk Sher-Niyaz founded the film production company ‘Aitysh Film’. The main objective of the film company is the development of Kyrgyz cinema by supporting the creativity of talented young people. Aitysh Film produces art-house, animation and documentary films.\n\n‘Kyrgyzstan – Land of Short Films’, an annual International Film Festival for short films from the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Baltic States and Georgia, has been held in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan since 2011. Traditionally, the festival opens on 12 December and lasts 4 days. The opening date of the festival marks the birthday of the famous Kyrgyz author Chingiz Aitmatov, who died in 2008. Aitmatov was also a screenwriter and former Head of the Union of Filmmakers of Kyrgyzstan.\n"}

The original work was created in 1928. It was sold in 2005 for $27.5 million, at the time a record price for a sculpture sold in an auction.\nThe original title in Romanian is Pasărea în văzduh.\n\nIn the \"Bird in Space\" works, Brâncuși concentrated not on the physical attributes of the bird, but instead on its movement. The bird's wings and feathers are eliminated, the swell of the body is elongated, and the head and beak are reduced to a slanted oval plane.\nSeven of the sculptures in the series are made of marble, while the other nine were cast in bronze. The first and best known of the series is housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, while two bronze casts (1928 and c.1941) reside in that city's Museum of Modern Art. Two versions of the sculpture, one bronze (1924) and one marble (1923–1924), are housed in the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., is home to a marble and a bronze from 1925 and 1927, respectively. A 1926 bronze is held by the Seattle Art Museum but is currently not on display. Two more bronze casts (1925–1926 and 1927) are on display at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and a 1931 bronze cast is housed at the Norton Simon Museum of Art in Pasadena, California. Another bronze of unknown casting date resides in the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice, Italy, and the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra owns two marbles, both c.1931-1936, one white and one black.\n\nIn 1926-27, \"Bird in Space\" was the subject of a court battle over its taxation by U.S. Customs. In October 1926, \"Bird in Space\", along with 19 other Brâncuși sculptures, arrived in New York harbor aboard the steamship \"Paris\". While works of art are not subject to custom duties, the customs officials refused to believe that the tall, thin piece of polished bronze was art and so imposed the tariff for manufactured metal objects, 40% of the sale price or about $230 (over $3130 in 2016 U.S. dollars). Marcel Duchamp (who accompanied the sculptures from Europe), American photographer Edward Steichen (who was to take possession of \"Bird in Space\" after exhibition), and Brâncuși himself were indignant; the sculptures were set to appear at the Brummer Gallery in New York City and then the Arts Club in Chicago. Under pressure from the press and artists, U.S. customs agreed to rethink their classification of the items, releasing the sculptures on bond (under \"Kitchen Utensils and Hospital Supplies\") until a decision could be reached. However, customs appraiser F. J. H. Kracke eventually confirmed the initial classification of items and said that they were subject to duty. Kracke told the \"New York Evening Post\" that \"several men, high in the art world were asked to express their opinions for the Government... One of them told us, 'If that's art, hereafter I'm a bricklayer.' Another said, 'Dots and dashes are as artistic as Brâncuși's work.' In general, it was their opinion that Brâncuși left too much to the imagination.\" The next month, Steichen filed an appeal to the U.S. Customs' decision.\n\nUnder the 1922 Tariff Act, for a sculpture to count as duty-free it must be an original work of art, with no practical purpose, made by a professional sculptor. No one argued that the piece had a practical purpose, but whether or not the sculpture was art was hotly contested. The 1916 case \"United States v. Olivotti\" had established that sculptures were art only if they were carved or chiseled representations of natural objects \"in their true proportions.\" Therefore, a series of artists and art experts testified for both the defense and the prosecution about the definition of art and who decides exactly what art is.\n\nBrâncuși's affidavit to the American Consulate explained the process of creating the piece, establishing its originality:\n\nDespite the varied opinions on what qualifies as art presented to the court, in November 1928 Judges Young and Waite found in favor of the artist. The decision drafted by Waite concluded:\n\nThis was the first court decision that accepted that non-representational sculpture could be considered art.\n\n\"Bird in Space\" was the inspiration for a classical music composition by composer Timothy A. Corpus. This work was premiered at the architectural festival Open House Chicago, in which the piece was performed throughout the festival at the Arts Club of Chicago.\n\nThe American poet, Muriel Rukeyser (1913-1980) refers to Brancusi's \"Bird\" in her poem, \"Reading time: 1 minute 26 seconds\" (1939) and uses this link to highlight the fear we have of embracing the new and non-utilitarian in the arts, and to encourage us to break through an unhealthy mind-set so that we may see the world anew: \"... The climax when the brain acknowledges the world, / all values extended into the blood awake. / Moment of proof. And as they say Brancusi did, / building his bird to extend through soaring air, / as Kafka planned stories that draw to eternity / through time extended. And the climax strikes. ...\" (from \"A Turning Wind\", 1939. Muriel Rukeyser).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46676803", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46676803", "title": "Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night", "text": "Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night\n\nBloodstained: Ritual of the Night is an upcoming action-adventure video game developed by ArtPlay, DICO and WayForward Technologies, and published by 505 Games. The game is led by former \"Castlevania\" series producer Koji Igarashi, and is considered a spiritual successor to the series. \"Bloodstained\" will be released for Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox One. It is expected to be released in 2019. A retro-style companion game, \"Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon\", was developed by Inti Creates and released in May 2018.\n\nIgarashi conceived the game after his departure from Konami in 2014, prompted by numerous fan requests for him to make another Metroidvania-type game. He used the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter to demonstrate to potential funding agencies of the demand for the game in 2015, which successfully raised more than 5.5 million from backers, making it the most funded video game crowdfunding campaign on the platform until it was surpassed by \"Shenmue III\" shortly after.\n\n\"Bloodstained\" follows the protagonist Miriam, an orphan who was taken in by an Alchemist guild and subjected to experiments that cause her to crystalize as the result of magi-crystals, crystalized demonic energy, being transplanted into her body. The ordeal placed her in a ten year coma, awakening to find her condition temporarily halted by an alchemist named Johannes who was against the guild's act to summon demons to their world, though his treatment can be averted should Miriam assimilate too many crystal shards from defeated demons. To prevent the outbreak of demons and end the curse while retaining her humanity, Miriam ventures into Demon Castle to confront Gebel, another of the alchemists' magi-crystal experiments who lost his humanity and summoned the demons to change the world.\n\nThe game is expected to follow the Metroidvania-style gameplay of the post-\"\" and \"\" games of the \"Castlevania\" series; by defeating enemies, Miriam will gain powers enabled by the crystals on her body, as well as items that can be used to craft new weapons and armor. The game will be presented in a 2.5D style, presenting the game in three-dimensional graphics but restricting movement to a 2D system. Igarashi stated the choice for 2.5D was that it follows in the style of his previous \"Castlevania\" games.\n\n\"Bloodstained\" is a spiritual successor to the \"Castlevania\" series by Konami, of which Koji Igarashi had been the series producer from 2001 to 2010. In March 2014, Igarashi opted to leave Konami, stating concern for his continued employment and differences in the directions they wanted to take the company. Igarashi later stated \"For the longest time, when I was working at Konami, I was protected by my company. They took care of me. Now I'm kind of anxious.\" Igarashi also stated that he had received a large number of requests from fans to continue to develop \"Castlevania\" games, giving him another reason to leave Konami and aim to start his own studio to develop these fan-requested games, including a Metroidvania-styled game with similar themes to \"Castlevania\".\n\nPrior to his departure, news of the success of the Kickstarter for \"Mighty No. 9\", a \"Mega Man\"-inspired game produced by the former series producer and artist Keiji Inafune, had reached Japan, and inspired Igarashi that this could be a similar route to obtain funding for a new game. Following his departure, he began pitching for funding of a new game with the help of Digital Development Management's Ben Judd, who has also assisted with \"Mighty No. 9\"s funding. They approached more than twenty publishers with the pitch, but found that none of them were willing to help. According to Judd, while Igarashi's reputation reduced the risk involved with the title and the projected budget was modest, the publishers were skeptical. Japanese publishers want to make sure that the American and European markets would want the title, and \"Castlevania\" games historically were not as well received in European markets. Western publishers believed the Japanese origins of the games were too strange for them. After six months with no success, Igarashi opted to join mobile developer ArtPlay as a paying job, but worked with the company to assure that he would be free to continue to pursue this new game idea.\n\nIgarashi recognized the success of \"Mighty No. 9\"s Kickstarter, and began seeking how to do that for his vision. He and Judd were able to locate investors that would help contribute funds, but only if they could show there was a strong interest in the title. The two opted to use Kickstarter to demonstrate what they believed would be a popular title, seeking to gain $500,000 to secure funding that would cover the remaining 10% of development costs. The Kickstarter was launched on 11 May 2015. Promotion and handling of the social media for the Kickstarter campaign was handled by Fangamer. Prior to the Kickstarter, Igarashi teased the announcement through social media using the phrases \"igavania\" and \"sword or whip\", and on the day of the announcement, participated in live streaming event via Twitch playing several other Metroidvania titles with various gaming personalities and developers. 2 Player Productions helped with filming Igarashi's pitch for the Kickstarter at Castello di Amorosa in northern California a month prior to its announcement.\n\nThe game succeeded in its base goal within four hours of going live, and reached $1.5 million within the first day. Various stretch goals were introduced and met, including obtaining David Hayter as a voice actor for the game. Hayter had originally been slated for the role of Gebel, but ended up as Zangetsu for the final game. Additional stretch goals included hiring Robert Belgrade, the voice of Alucard in \"Symphony of the Night\" to have a voice role, and allowing artist Ayami Kojima to create the packaging artwork for physical copies. Additional stretch goals include support for local co-operative play, a boss rush mode, a \"classic mode\" which will rework some portions of the game's maps into strictly-linear levels akin to the original \"Castlevania\" games, and a roguelike dungeon mode where the player can challenge a procedurally-generated dungeon. In addition to monetary stretch goals, Igarashi is offering additional bonuses for all backers based on the amount of social media content the Kickstarter generates, such as followers of the game on Twitter or Facebook or number of pieces of fan artwork submitted to its site. The \"Bloodstained\" Kickstarter was successfully funded with more than $5.5M in pledges, and the highest value video game Kickstarter project, exceeding the previous amount set by \"\". However, about two months afterwards, the Kickstarter for \"Shenmue III\" broke \"Bloodstained\"s record, raising over $6.3 million in a similar period as \"Bloodstained\".\n\nIgarashi and ArtPlay are developing the game's narrative, design, and overseeing production, while they have hired DICO as a third-party publisher around June 2016 to assist in developing the game's assets and level design. The game will be published and marketed by 505 Games. Developer Inti Creates, whose name had been associated with \"Bloodstained\" earlier in the project, have been involved in developing a mini-game that will be released alongside the main game. \"Bloodstained\" is being developed for Unreal Engine 4. Armature Studio was set to port the PlayStation Vita and Wii U versions before their cancellation, which were stretch goals of the campaign. Armature Studio also planned to release the code base for both the Wii U and Vita ports for free to any studio licensed to work on it, as Unreal Engine 4 is not officially supported on either system. Near the end of 2018, Igarashi announced they had also brought on WayForward Technologies to help with some development, specifically in the area of polishing the title. Igarashi had been impressed by WayForward's skill in 2D platform games, such as their \"Shantae\" series, and was excited for them to be part of the project.\n\nThe game's music will be written by Michiru Yamane, a former Konami composer who worked on the music for several \"Castlevania\" games, Ippo Yamada, Jake Kaufman, and members of the musical group Noisycroak. Shutaro Iida, who worked on previous \"Castlevania\" games as a programmer, director and designer, is returning to the game in the role of a planner.\n\nA single-level demonstration of \"Bloodstained\" was made available to play for attendees of Electronic Entertainment Expo 2016, and was released to Kickstarter backers a week later. In July 2016, Igarashi announced that the game had entered full production.\n\nThough Igarashi originally anticipated a 2017 release, he announced in September 2016 that he was bringing a second studio to help with the development of the game, and delayed the game. Igarashi stated the delay was primarily due to the added work to complete the campaign's stretch goals, a factor he could not consider during the Kickstarter period, and his commitment to making a high quality game, \"better than a traditional Iga-vania game that I've made in the past\" and not wanting to back down on quality just to make the original release date. The amount of work in man-hours, along with Inti Create's inexperience with the Unreal engine to complete some of the concepts he wanted in the game, led Igarashi to bring in additional studios and push back the release date. Igarashi later revealed these studios as DICO, who have experience with localization and global development, and Monobit, for technical assistance with the game engine. The game is slated for release in 2019.\n\nIn March 2017, Igarashi opted to transfer development from the Wii U to the Nintendo Switch, offering backers who had selected the Wii U version a refund or a choice of the game on a different platform, with the Switch being the default option for backers who had previously chosen the Wii U. Igarashi had started the Kickstarter when the Wii U was the dominant Nintendo platform, but with the introduction of the Switch since that point, he found it difficult to support the Wii U, and made the transition.\n\nThe game's name is based around the concept of magi-crystal curse that inflicts the main characters: they grow across the person's body with the appearance of stained glass, and Igarashi felt that \"Bloodstained\" was a good play on words to reflect that. While the title is thematically based around the Gothic theme like \"Castlevania\", Igarashi did not want to incorporate the public domain character of Dracula into it, feeling it would make the game too close to previous \"Castlevania\" titles and did not want to make his new game feel like a \"half-baked copy\". Igarashi opted to make the main playable character Miriam female based on recognizing current trends in video games in Western markets to present strong female lead characters that the broad range of intended players of either gender would enjoy playing, while avoiding the developmental encumbrances of creating two separate-gendered playable characters.\n\nThe development team announced that they would release the game using a staggered content model, following the approach used by \"Shovel Knight\", so that they are able to release the core game on time, and bring additional content to the game over time and avoid critical release delays. On August 20, 2018, the team announced that the PlayStation Vita version of the game had been cancelled due to Sony dropping support for the system; backers that desired the Vita release were given the option of selecting the game for a different platform for free or assorted refund options.\n\nAs part of the Kickstarter's stretch goals, Inti Creates also developed a companion game, \"Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon\", a NES-stylized platform game with Miriam and Gebel playable alongside the swordsman exorcist Zangetsu and the alchemist Alfred. It was released on Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Xbox One, Nintendo 3DS, and Nintendo Switch on May 24, 2018.\n\n"}

Astrolabes are calculation instruments that enable their users to tell the time and determine their geographical latitude using the position of the sun and stars. An extremely rare instrument, the Canterbury Astrolabe Quadrant probably belonged to a travelling scholar who may have lost it in Canterbury while on pilgrimage to that city.\n\nIt is also the first astrolabe to have been found during an archaeological dig.

It was the last of Anderson's books to be published by Boni & Liveright before the firm's financial collapse. Most of the stories in the collection were previously published either in magazines (\"Why They Got Married\" appeared in the March 1929 issue of \"Vanity Fair\", for example, and \"A Meeting South\" was first published in \"The Dial\" of April 1925) and books (versions of \"Death in the Woods\" and \"A Meeting South\" were included in \"\" and \"Sherwood Anderson's Notebook\" (both 1926), respectively). According to John Earl Bassett, most of the stories in \"Death in the Woods\" were written between 1926 and 1930 with four preceding that time and one following.\n\nThe collection is made up of 16 stories:\n\n\"Death in the Woods\" is presented as a first-person narrative by an unreliable narrator, who tells the story of an old woman, Mrs. Grimes. Mrs. Grimes lives on the edge of society and survives by selling eggs and using the proceeds to buy food for herself, her small family and the animals in her care. Her husband is considered to be a horse thief, and the couple is looked down on by others.\n\nMrs. Grimes' personal history, according to the narrator, is that she was abandoned by her mother and grew up as an indentured servant. It is suggested that there she received inappropriate attentions from her German master. The master's wife was suspicious and perhaps cruel toward her. Mrs. Grimes agrees to marry Jake Grimes, who \"helps\" her escape her German master and his wife.\n\nMrs. Grimes and Jake Grime have a son and a daughter, but the daughter died in childhood. The narrator tells us that their son grows up to be like his father. Both of them verbally abused Mrs. Grimes and treat her in a manner similar to the way the German and his wife had treated her. She does not know life could be any different as this is all she ever experienced, according to the narrator. Her main concern in life is taking care of, and feeding the animals and people in her care. Her duty, she feels, is to feed animal life.\n\nOn the last day of her life, Mrs. Grimes walks into town to trade some eggs and buy some meager supplies. Her dogs follow her into town. According to the narrator, the butcher was unusually friendly and compassionate on this visit (because of the snowy, cold weather), giving her some extra liver and speaking to her kindly. She begins her walk home late in the day.\n\nOn her way home, she leaves the road and walks through the woods, probably a short cut. On this shortcut she reaches a clearing where she sits down to rest. While sitting down, she dies. The dogs, that had been following her, run around her in circles, then rip the pack away from her and devour the food inside.\n\nThe body is discovered by a hunter, who goes into town and tells everyone about the body in the woods. A group of men and some boys, including the narrator, walk into the woods to examine the body and bring it back.\n\nWhen the narrator and his brother return home, the older brother tells the story.

{"id": "247274", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=247274", "title": "Extended family", "text": "Extended family\n\nAn extended family is a family that extends beyond the nuclear family, consisting of parents like father, mother, and their children, aunts, uncles, and cousins, all living nearby or in the same household. An example is a married couple that lives with either the husband or the wife's parents. The family changes from immediate household to extended household.\n\nIn some circumstances, the extended family comes to live either with or in place of a member of the immediate family. These families include, in one household, near relatives in addition to an immediate family. An example would be an elderly parent who moves in with his or her children due to old age. In modern Western cultures dominated by immediate family constructs, the term has come to be used generically to refer to grandparents, uncles, aunts, and cousins, whether they live together within the same household or not. However, it may also refer to a family unit in which several generations live together within a single household. In some cultures, the term is used synonymously with consanguineous family.\n\nIn a stem family, a type of extended family, first presented by Frédéric Le Play, parents will live with one child and his or her spouse, as well as the children of both, while other children will leave the house or remain in it unmarried. The stem family is sometimes associated with inegalitarian inheritance practices, as in Japan and Korea, but the term has also been used in some contexts to describe a family type where parents live with a married child and his or her spouse and children, but the transfer of land and moveable property is more or less egalitarian, as in the case of traditional Romania, northeastern Thailand or Mesoamerican indigenous peoples. In these cases, the child who cares for the parents usually receives the house in addition to his or her own share of land and moveable property.\n\nIn an extended family, parents and their children's families may often live under a single roof. This type of joint family often includes multiple generations in the family. From culture to culture, the variance of the term may have different meanings. For instance, in India, the family is a patriarchal society, with the sons' families often staying in the same house.\n\nIn the joint family, the workload is shared among the members. The patriarch of the family (often the oldest male member) is the head of the household. Grandparents are usually involved in the raising process of the children along with guidance and education. Like any family unit the success and structure are dependent on the personalities of the individuals involved.\n\nAmy Goyer, AARP multigenerational issues expert, said the most common multigenerational household is one with a grandparent as head of household and his adult children having moved in with their children, an arrangement usually spurred by the needs of one or both to combine resources and save money. The second most popular is a grandparent moving in with an adult child's family, usually for care-giving reasons. She noted that 2.5 million grandparents say they are responsible for the basic needs of the grandchild living with them.\n\nThe house often has a large reception area and a common kitchen. Each family has their own bedroom. The members of the household also look after each other when a member is ill.\n\nIt has often been presumed that extended family groups sharing a single household enjoy certain advantages, such as a greater sense of security and belonging due to sharing a wider pool of members to serve as resources during a crisis, and more role models to help perpetuate desired behavior and cultural values. However, even in cultures in which adults are expected to leave home after marriage to begin their own nuclear-based households, the extended family often forms an important support network offering similar advantages. Particularly in working-class communities, grown children tend to establish their own households within the same general area as their parents, aunts, uncles, and grandparents. These extended family members tend to gather often for family events and to feel responsible for helping and supporting one another, both emotionally and financially.\n\nWhile contemporary families may be considered more mobile in general than in the past, sociologists find that this has not necessarily resulted in the disintegration of extended family networks. Rather, technological aids such as the Internet and social networking sites such as Facebook are now commonly used to retain contact and maintain these family ties.\n\nParticularly in the case of single-parent households, it can be helpful for extended family members to share a single household in order to share the burden of meeting expenses. On the other hand, sharing a household can present a disadvantage depending on the sizes and number of families involved, particularly when only a few members shoulder most of the responsibility to meet expenses for the family's basic needs.\n\nAn estimated 49 million Americans (16.1% of the total population) live in homes comprising three or more generations, up from 42 million in 2000. This situation is similar in Western Europe. Another 34 percent live within a kilometer of their children.\n\nIn many cultures, such as in those of many of the Asians, Middle Easterners, Africans, Eastern Europeans, Southern Europe, indigenous Latin Americans and Pacific Islanders, \"extended families\" are the basic family unit. Even in Western Europe, extended families (mostly of the stem type) were also clearly prevalent, England being a rare exception. Some have stated that the relative \"uniqueness\" of the traditional English family (the absolute nuclear family) was at least partly responsible for the birth of industrialization, free-market capitalism and liberalism in that country.\n\nIt is common for today's world to have older children in nuclear families to reach walking up to driving age ranges before meeting extended family members. Geographical isolation is common for middle-class families who move based on occupational opportunities while family branches \"retain [their] basic independence\". Some extended families hold family reunions or opportunities for gathering regularly, normally around holiday time frames, to reestablish and integrate a stronger family connection. This allows individual nuclear families to connect with extended family members.\n\nAustralian Aborigines are another group for whom the concept of family extends well beyond the nuclear model. Aboriginal immediate families include aunts, uncles and a number of other relatives who would be considered \"distant relations\" in the context of the nuclear family. Aboriginal families have strict social rules regarding whom they can marry. Their family structure incorporates a shared responsibility for all tasks.\n\nWhere families consist of multiple generations living together, the family is usually headed by the oldest man. More often than not, it consists of grandparents, their sons and their sons' families. Extended families make discussions together and solve a problem.\n\nHistorically, for generations South Asia had a prevailing tradition of the \"joint family system\" or \"undivided family\". Joint family system is an extended family arrangement prevalent throughout the Indian subcontinent, particularly in India, consisting of many generations living in the same home, all bound by the common relationship. A patrilineal joint family consists of an older man and his wife, his sons and unmarried daughters, his sons’ wives and children. The family is headed by a patriarch, usually the oldest male, who makes decisions on economic and social matters on behalf of the entire family. The patriarch's wife generally exerts control over the household, minor religious practices and often wields considerable influence in domestic matters. Family income flows into a common pool, from which resources are drawn to meet the needs of all members, which are regulated by the heads of the family.\n\nIn the early stages of the twentieth century, it was not very common to find many families with extended kin in their household, which may have been due to the idea that the young people in these times typically waited to establish themselves and start a household before they married and filled a home. As life expectancy becomes older and programs such as Social Security benefit the elderly, the old are now beginning to live longer than prior generations, which then may lead to generations mixing together. According to results of a study by Pew Research Center in 2010, approximately 50 million (nearly one in six) Americans, including rising numbers of seniors, live in households with at least two adult generations, and often three. It has become an ongoing trend for elderly generations to move in and live with their children, as they can give them support and help with everyday living. The main reasons cited for this shift are an increase in unemployment and slumped housing prices and arrival of new immigrants from Asian and South American countries. In 2003, the number of U.S. \"family groups\" where one or more subfamilies live in a household (e.g. a householder's daughter has a child. The mother-child is a subfamily) was 79 million. Two-point-six million of U.S. multigenerational family households in 2000 had a householder, the householder's children, and the householder's grandchildren. That's 65 percent of multigenerational family households in the U.S. So it is twice as common for a grandparent to be the householder than for adult children to bring parents into their home. The increase in the number of multigenerational households has created complex legal issues, such as who in the household has authority to consent to police searches of the family home or private bedrooms.\n\nMexican society is composed of three-generational units consisting of grandparents, children and grandchildren. Further close relationships are maintained with the progenitors of these families and are known as kin or \"cousins\" When one is born they are born into two extended families, a kinship group of sometimes 70 people. The group traditionally acts as a cohesive unit pooling resources and influence. The extended family also consists of spouses and siblings. This is in contrast to the two generational American nuclear family.\n\nSome scholars have used the term \"grand-family\" to describe the close relationship between grandparents, children, and grandchildren in Mexican society. Larissa A. Lomnitz and Marisol Perez-Lizaur, for example, describe the grand-family as \"the basic unit of family solidarity in Mexico\", where basic family obligations between grandparents, children, and grandchildren include \"economic support, participation in family rituals, and social recognition\". Katie Willis and Cathy Mcilwaine also note that grand-families are a \"distinctive feature\" of \"low-income\", \"middle-income\", as well as \"elite sectors\" of Mexican society.\n\nEconomic background has become a very prominent factor in the likelihood of living in an extended family. Many families who live in low-income areas are beginning to move in with one another for financial and emotional support. The relative economic deprivation of racial and ethnic minorities leads to higher levels of extended family involvement; primarily because blacks and Latinos have less money and education than whites, they are more likely to give and receive help from kin. Having family on which one can rely is very important in times of economic hardship especially if there are children involved. Living in an extended family provides constant care for children and support for other members of the family as well. Analysis of the National Survey of Families and Households suggests there are differences between whites and other ethnic groups because of economic differences among racial groups: blacks and Latinos less often have the economic resources that allow the kind of privatization that the nuclear family entails. Extended kinship, then, is a survival strategy in the face of economic difficulties. Being able to rely on not only two parents but grandparents, aunts, uncles, brothers, and sisters helps to create a support system which in turn brings families closer together. Living in an extended family provides many things that a nuclear family does not.\n\nThe number of multigenerational households has been steadily rising because of the economic hardships people are experiencing today. According to the AARP, multigenerational households have increased from 5 million in 2000 to 6.2 million in 2008.\"There's no question that with some ethnicities that are growing in America, it is more mainstream and traditional to have multigenerational households. We're going to see that increasing in the general population as well,\" says AARP's Ginzler. While high unemployment and housing foreclosures of the recession have played a key role in the trend, Pew Research Center exec VP and co-author of its multigenerational household study Paul Taylor said it has been growing over several decades, fueled by demographic and cultural shifts such as the rising number of immigrants and the rising average age of young-adult marriages. The importance of an extended family is one that many people may not realize, but having a support system and many forms of income may help people today because of the difficulties in finding a job and bringing in enough money.\n\n\"Complex family\" is a generic term for any family structure involving more than two adults. The term can refer to any extended family, polyamorous or to a polygamy of any type. It is often used to refer to the group marriage form of polygamy.\n\n"}
{"id": "9180166", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9180166", "title": "Gay icon", "text": "Gay icon\n\nA gay icon is a public figure (historical or present) who is embraced by many within lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) communities.\n\nSome of the main qualities of a gay icon often include glamour, flamboyance, strength through adversity, and androgyny in presentation. Such icons can be of any sexual orientation or gender; if LGBT, they can be out or not. Although most gay icons have given their support to LGBT social movements, some have expressed opposition, advocating against a perceived \"homosexual agenda\".\n\nHistorically, icons were typically elevated to such status because their sexual orientation remains a topic of debate among historians. Modern gay icons are predominantly female entertainers who commonly garner a large following within LGBT communities over the course of their careers.\n\nThe earliest gay icon may have been Saint Sebastian, a Christian saint and martyr, whose combination of strong and shirtless physique, symbolic arrow-pierced flesh and rapturous look of pain have intrigued artists, both gay and straight, for centuries and began the first explicitly gay cult in the nineteenth century. Journalist Richard A. Kaye wrote, \"Contemporary gay men have seen in Sebastian at once a stunning advertisement for homosexual desire (indeed, a homoerotic ideal), and a prototypical portrait of a tortured closet case.\"\n\nDue to Saint Sebastian's status as a gay icon, Tennessee Williams chose to use the saint's name for the martyred character Sebastian in his play, \"Suddenly, Last Summer\". The name was also used by Oscar Wilde—as Sebastian Melmoth—when in exile after his release from prison. Wilde, an Irish writer and poet, was about as \"out of the closet\" as was possible for the late 19th century, and is himself considered to be a gay icon.\n\nMarie Antoinette was an early lesbian icon. Rumors about her relationships with women circulated in pornographic detail by anti-royalist pamphlets before the French Revolution. In Victorian England, biographers who idealized the Ancien Régime made a point of denying the rumours, but at the same time romanticised Marie Antoinette's \"sisterly\" friendship with the Princesse de Lamballe as—in the words of an 1858 biography—one of the \"rare and great loves that Providence unites in death.\" By the end of the 19th century, she was a cult icon of \"sapphism.\" Her execution, seen as tragic martyrdom, may have added to her appeal.\n\nAllusions to her appearance were made in early 20th century lesbian literature—most notably Radclyffe Hall's \"The Well of Loneliness\"—where the gay playwright Jonathan Brockett describes Marie Antoinette and de Lamballe as \"poor souls... sick to death of the subterfuge and pretenses.\" She had crossover appeal as a gay icon, as well, at least for French novelist, playwright, poet, essayist, and political activist Jean Genet, who was fascinated by her story. He included a reenactment of her execution in his 1947 play \"The Maids\".\n\nModern gay icons in entertainment include film stars and musicians, most of whom have strong, distinctive personalities, and many of whom died young or under tragic circumstances. For example, Greek-American opera singer Maria Callas—who reached her peak in the 1950s—became a gay icon because the uniquely compelling qualities of her stage performances were allied to a tempestuous private life, a sequence of unhappy love affairs, and a lonely premature death in Paris after her voice had deserted her.\n\nLesbian icons, sometimes called \"dykons\" (a portmanteau of the words \"dyke\" and \"icon\") are most often powerful women who are, or are rumored to be, lesbian or bisexual. However, a few male entertainers have also had iconic status for lesbian people. James Dean was an early lesbian icon who, along with Marlon Brando, influenced the butch look and self-image in the 1950s and after. One critic has argued for Johnny Cash as a minor lesbian icon, attributing his appeal to \"lesbian identification with troubled and suffering masculinity.\" Science fiction author Forrest J Ackerman was dubbed an \"honorary lesbian\" for his help during the early days of lesbian rights organisation Daughters of Bilitis. He also wrote lesbian-themed fiction under the pseudonym Laurajean Ermayne.\n\nGay icons may be homosexual or heterosexual, out or in the closet, male or female. The women most commonly portrayed by drag queens are usually gay icons. The definition of what it means to be a \"gay icon\" has come under criticism in recent years for a lack of substance. Paul Flynn of \"The Guardian\" wrote, \"The concept of gay icon is a cheap ticket...[and] the idea of gay iconography itself is currently replaceable with the idea of popularity and the ability to carry a strong, identifiable, signature look.\" Author Michael Thomas Ford depicts a similar attitude in his work of fiction \"Last Summer\".\n\nAlthough the term \"gay icon\" is most commonly used in the United States, the concept is found in other cultures, as well. Dalida, an Egyptian singer of Italian origin, had a career-long gay following that extended out of Paris and well into the Middle East. In the years since her death, her iconic status has not diminished.\nAs a result of their pro-LGBT activism and their artistry, Taiwanese singers A-mei and Jolin Tsai, Indian actor Anil Kapoor and Indian actress Sonam Kapoor and Hong Kong singer, Leslie Cheung have been called gay icons.\n\nSimilarly, in European countries such as the Netherlands, Dutch singer and actress Willeke Alberti is widely embraced as a gay icon, due to a combination of her song repertoire, her durability, and her performances in support of manifold gay causes. Spanish actress Carmen Maura, Spanish politician Pedro Zerolo, Italian singer Mina, and Raffaella Carrà, Scottish pop singer Jimmy Somerville, German actress and singer Hildegard Knef and English singers Dusty Springfield and Sophie Ellis-Bextor are also considered gay icons, as are French entertainers Dalida, Mylène Farmer, Lorie, Jenifer, Alizée and Ysa Ferrer, Ukrainian boy band Kazaky, Turkish singer Ajda Pekkan and Italian actress Isabella Rossellini.\n\nLatin American figures have also gained reputations as gay icons. Pop band Alaska y Dinarama is one example. Their single \"¿A quién le importa?\" (\"Who Cares?\"), which was later covered in 2002 by Thalía, was a hit for the 1980s Spanish band, becoming a gay anthem for the Hispanophone LGBT community. Singer Gloria Trevi is considered a gay icon, especially after her release of \"Todos Me Miran\" (\"They All Are Looking at Me\") featuring a rejected gay man turned drag queen, but had been popular with the gay and lesbian community in Mexico since the beginning of her career for being a controversial and powerful singer. Mexican singer and actress Paulina Rubio has been a gay icon for Latin America after supporting gay marriage and publicly stating that she wants to have sex with fellow gay icon Madonna.\n\nOther modern Latin American gay icons include singers Alaska, Ricky Martin, La Lupe, Sara Montiel, Lola Flores and Chavela Vargas.\n\nArgentine gay icons include actresses Isabel Sarli, Susana Giménez and Moria Casán, the trans woman Florencia de la V, First Lady Eva Perón and President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner.\n\nVenezuelan actresses Mimi Lazo, Haydée Balza, Lila Morillo, Mirtha Perez, Kiara and Hilda Abrahamz are the most beloved gay icons in the country, often impersonated by drag queens. Other artist who have fought for gay rights in the country are the model and actress Patricia Velazquez, the playwriter Isaac Chocrón, the journalist Boris Izaguirre, the actors Edgar Ramirez and Luis Fernandez as for the youtuber Pedro Figueira known as La Divaza.\n\nIn Brazil, pop singers Kelly Key, Sandy, Lorena Simpson, Preta Gil, and Wanessa are considered gay icons. In 2012, Key was honored with the \"Pink Triangle Award,\" a Brazilian LGBT award, considered the \"Gay Oscar\".\n\nThe 1930s saw a number of writers, political activists, and celebrities garner reputations as gay icons. Poet and satirical writer Dorothy Parker reportedly had a large gay following. Though the phrase \"friend of Dorothy\" was made popular in later years by Judy Garland's role in \"The Wizard Of Oz\" (1939), some speculate it originated with Parker.\nActress Bette Davis' performance in \"Dark Victory\" (1939), was dubbed by queer theorist Eve Sedgwick as \"the epistemology of the closet.\" Davis' portrayal of the melodramatic Judith Traherne made her talent for playing someone with a secret revered and her \"camp-worthy\" dialog reflexive of the \"flamboyant gay queen of the dramatic arts.\" Ed Sikov, author of \"Dark Victory: The Life of Bette Davis\", wrote that 20th century gay men developed their own subculture following Davis' example.\n\nIn Marcella Althaus-Reid's \"Liberation Theology and Sexuality\", Marlene Dietrich, who is considered to be the first German-born actress to receive critical acclaim in Hollywood, is a model of liberation and subversion, as well as beauty, perfection and sensuality. In Rio de Janeiro, Althaus-Reid discovered a statue of Dietrich dressed as Our Lady of Aparecida in a gay bar in Copacabana beach. The image of Dietrich as the black Virgin Mary represents her overcoming duality. According to Althaus-Reid, it is a figure that sanctifies Dietrich while simultaneously liberating Mary.\n\nOther icons from this time period include Cary Grant, who endured speculation over his alleged relationships with men.\n\nAn archetypal gay icon is Judy Garland. Michael Bronski, author of \"Culture Clash: The Making of Gay Sensibility\", describes Garland as \"the quintessential pre-Stonewall gay icon.\" So revered is she as a gay icon that her best known film role, Dorothy Gale in \"The Wizard of Oz\", became used as code among homosexuals in the 1950s.\n\nThe expression \"Is he a friend of Dorothy?\" was slang for \"Is he gay?\" The character Dorothy meets an odd group of friends during her journey through Oz—the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion and the Scarecrow—and so referring to an individual as a \"friend of Dorothy\" meant that they were \"unusual or odd\" and, therefore, \"queer\". Though Garland has been noted for her embodiment of camp in her acting roles, Bronski argues that she was the \"antithesis of camp\" and \"made a legend of her pain and oppression.\" As Bronski observes, the bleak setting of 1950s Hollywood had replaced the \"sauciness of the [1930s] and the independence of the [1940s].\" Garland, as well as Connie Francis, Lana Turner and Susan Hayward, epitomized the idea that \"suffering was the price of glamor...[and] the women stars of the [1950s] reflected the condition of many gay men: they suffered, beautifully\".\nGarland's daughter Liza Minnelli would later follow in her mother's footsteps as a gay icon, as would fellow musical artist Barbra Streisand. Joan Crawford has been described as the \"ultimate gay icon—the martyr who suffered for her art and, therefore, enabled herself to bond with this all-important faction of her fanbase.\" In \"Joan Crawford: The Essential Biography\", author Lawrence J. Quirk explains that Crawford appealed to gay men because they sympathized with her struggle for success, in both the entertainment industry and in her personal life. Though Crawford had been a notable film star during the 1930s and 1940s, according to David Bret, author of \"Joan Crawford: Hollywood Martyr\", it was not until her 1953 film \"Torch Song\" that she was seen as a \"complete gay icon, primarily because it was shot in color.\" Bret explains that seeing the actress' red hair, dark eyes and \"Victory Red\" lips linked her to \"gaydom's other sirens: Dietrich, Garland, Bankhead, Piaf, and new recruits Marilyn Monroe and Maria Callas.\"\n\nActress Lucille Ball was also a prominent icon from this period. In Lee Tannen's book \"I Loved Lucy: My Friendship with Lucille Ball\", the author describes his experience when he witnessed Lucille Ball being labeled a gay icon for the first time by a mutual friend. Ball was told of the adoration she received from gay men, as a bar in West Hollywood was known for routinely playing episodes of her television series \"I Love Lucy\" every weekend.\n\nDuring the late 1970s, many female comedians appeared, joining the ranks of what had stereotypically been a male profession, including Joan Rivers, who began appearing on \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\". Rivers gained a strong gay following after performing in Greenwich Village, an LGBT friendly area of New York, from the early days of her career. Rivers' frank and sharp use of wit and insults (largely turned toward herself) made her an instant gay icon. \nThe first gay icon of the 1970s underground gay disco scene was the \"Queen of Disco\" Donna Summer, whose dance songs became anthems for the clubbing gay community, and her music the back beat to the battles of the gay rights movement of the 1970s. Her number one single \"Love to Love You Baby\"—regarded as an \"absolute disco epic\"—not only became a gay anthem because of its \"unabridged sexuality\", but it also brought European-oriented disco to the United States and influenced the course the recording industry would take in the following years. However, Summer became immersed in controversy when, after becoming a Born again Christian, and during a 1983–84 tour, at the dawn of the HIV/AIDS crisis, she was allegedly reported as making homophobic remarks; including that \"AIDS was God's punishment to homosexuals.\" Fellow disco singer Gloria Gaynor was embraced by the gay community because of her single \"I Will Survive\", which served as an anthem for both feminists and the gay rights movement. The Village People, a pioneering disco group, are also regarded as gay icons for bringing gay disco culture into the mainstream with their popular disco and dance hits; and their costumes, with each member of the group representing a part of gay erotica (a policeman, a sailor, a construction worker, a cowboy, a leather clad man).\n\nActress Lynda Carter became a gay icon after starring as Wonder Woman in the 1975–1979 series of the same name. Her role as the heroine attracted the LGBT community for her onscreen persona of female strength and fashionable outfits. Carter is a vocal supporter of LGBT equality and has participated in the New York City Gay Pride Parade.\n\nSinger Sylvester became a gay icon after releasing his Hi-NRG single \"You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)\" in 1978. Sylvester often made appearances in drag, and often described as a disco diva because of his falsetto voice and flamboyant appearance. He also influenced the gay nightclub scene in the late seventies and eighties. Sylvester died of AIDS-related complications in 1988.\n\nSinger Cass Elliot became known as a gay icon, both during her solo career and as a member of The Mamas & the Papas. Her musical impact became known through her camp fashion and lyrics praising individuality (such as \"Make Your Own Kind of Music\" and \"Different\") and free love. Her music was later featured in the acclaimed gay film \"Beautiful Thing\" (1996), adapted from the play of the same name.\n\nSinger and actress Bette Midler became recognized as a gay icon in the 1970s. After performing on Broadway, Midler began performing at the Continental Baths, a gay bathhouse in the city, where she became close to her piano accompanist Barry Manilow, who produced her first major album \"The Divine Miss M\" (1973). \"Despite the way things turned out [with the AIDS crisis], I'm still proud of those days [singing at gay bathhouses]. I feel like I was at the forefront of the gay liberation movement, and I hope I did my part to help it move forward. So, I kind of wear the label of 'Bathhouse Betty' with pride,\" Midler reminisced in 1998.\n\nFreddie Mercury, the lead vocalist of Queen, was widely considered a gay icon, with his LGBT fanbase growing by the 1980s. Although Freddie Mercury never revealed his sexuality publicly (even when events made it seem inevitable), he often \"playfully alluded to his queerness with his flamboyant, high-camp stage antics\", according to \"Gay Star News\". In 1992, John Marshall of \"Gay Times\" expressed the following opinion: \"[Mercury] was a 'scene-queen,' not afraid to publicly express his gayness, but unwilling to analyse or justify his 'lifestyle' ... It was as if Freddie Mercury was saying to the world, 'I am what I am. So what?' And that in itself for some was a statement.\" Many assumed him to be either gay or bisexual and not sexually active. He would often distance himself from his later partner, Jim Hutton, during public events. On the evening of November 24, 1991, Mercury died at the age of 45 at his home in Kensington of AIDS-related illnesses (bronchial pneumonia).\n\nArtists particularly embraced by the gay community during the 1980s included Whitney Houston, Patti Labelle, Alaska, Charo, Dolly Parton, Elaine Paige, Amanda Lear, Prince and Mylène Farmer. Several Britons were seen as gay icons, including singers Boy George, David Bowie, George Michael, Morrissey, Pet Shop Boys, Kate Bush, Annie Lennox, and writer Quentin Crisp. Elton John also became a gay icon during this decade, a status strengthened throughout the years.\nDiana Ross, a long time gay icon, of The Supremes; released a song I'm Coming Out which brought a significance to the phrase of \"Coming out.\"\nCher became notable in the gay community not only for her music, but also her drag, her leather outfits of the 80s made her popular with the leather crowd. In later years, her son Chaz Bono came out as gay at the age of 17 (and many years later as a transgender man), much to his mother's initial feelings of \"guilt, fear and pain\". When Cher was able to accept her son's sexual orientation, she realized that Chaz, as well as other LGBT people, \"didn't have the same rights as everyone else, [and she] thought that was unfair\". Cher emerged not only as an icon among LGBT people, but also as a role model for straight parents who have gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender children. She became the keynote speaker for the 1997 national Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) convention. Cher's longevity in the music industry has often been credited to her gay following. William J. Mann, author of \"Gay Pride: A Celebration of All Things Gay and Lesbian,\" comments \"[w]e'll be dancing to a 90-year-old Cher when we're 60. Just watch\".\n\nContinuing into the 1980s, pop music singer Madonna—dubbed the \"Queen of Pop\" and \"Queen of Dance\" by the media, and later the \"World's Most Successful Female Recording Artist\" by \"Guinness World Records\"—became the preeminent gay icon of the late 20th century. \"The Advocate\"s Steve Gdula commented \"[b]ack in the 1980s and even the early 1990s, the release of a new Madonna video or single was akin to a national holiday, at least among her gay fans.\" Gdula also stated that during this period, concurrent with the rise of the AIDS epidemic, \"when other artists tried to distance themselves from the very audience that helped their stars to rise, Madonna only turned the light back on her gay fans and made it burn all the brighter.\"\n\nGeorges Claude Guilbert, author of \"Madonna As Postmodern Myth: How One Star's Self-Construction Rewrites Sex, Gender, Hollywood and the American Dream\", writes that Madonna's reverence as a gay icon is equated with that of Judy Garland, noting similarities between the two popular culture icons. Guilbert writes that gay icons \"usually belong to one or the other of two types of female stars: either the very vulnerable or suicidal star, or the strong idol whom nobody or nothing resists, like Madonna.\" According to \"\", the pop star has always been aware that her most loyal fans were gay men, has appeared in gay-oriented magazines as an activist for gay rights, and was even named in the book \"The Gay 100\" as one of the most influential gay people in history.\nOther superstar recording artists, including Cyndi Lauper, followed. Lauper and Madonna were seen as trailblazers of women's sexual liberation. Lauper's debut album \"She's So Unusual\" (1983) generated a large following of fans responding to the \"gay-friendly camp and lesbian-friendly womyn power epitomized in [her] femme anthem 'Girls Just Want to Have Fun'.\" Lauper explained that growing up during the 1960s influenced her dedication to fair and equal treatment of all people, noting that the music of the 1960s \"helped to open the world's point of view to change.\" According to Lauper \"It wasn't until my sister came out in the early [1970s] that I became more aware of the bigoted slurs and the violence against a community of people...who were gay.\" Lauper has since become an active gay rights activist, often encouraging LGBT people and their allies to vote for equal rights. Political activism for LGBT rights was the theme of Lauper's annual True Colors Tour.\n\nIn the mid- to late-1980s, Oprah Winfrey emerged as an icon for the gay community with an intimate confessional communication style that altered the cultural landscape. According to the book \"Freaks Talk Back\" by Yale sociologist Joshua Gamson, the tabloid talk show genre popularized by Oprah Winfrey and Phil Donahue, did more to make gay people mainstream and socially acceptable than any other development of the 20th century by providing decades of high-impact media visibility for sexual nonconformists.\n\nFellow gay icon Ellen DeGeneres cast Winfrey to play the therapist she comes out of the closet to on the controversial episode of her \"Ellen\" sitcom. Though Winfrey abandoned her tabloid talk show format in the mid-1990s as the genre became flooded by more extreme clones like Ricki Lake, Jenny Jones and Jerry Springer, she continued to broadcast shows that were perceived as gay-friendly. Her show \"Oprah's Big Give\" was the first reality TV show with an openly gay host Nate Berkus. Her own show has been nominated several times for GLAAD Media Awards, and another in 2010 for an interview with Ellen DeGeneres and her wife Portia de Rossi, winning one in 2007 Oprah Winfrey also co-produced the Oscar-winning film \"\" (2009), which was honored by GLAAD for portraying a lesbian couple as heroines.\n\nWinfrey's iconic status among gay males has entered the popular culture. One of the stars of the reality TV show \"The Benefactor\" was a gay African American man named Kevin who was so obsessed with Winfrey that he would ask \"What would Oprah do?\" before making any strategic decision. Adam Lambert is another high-profile gay man who has described himself as a fan of Winfrey. Other icons from this decade include Joan Collins, Tori Amos, Tina Arena, Harvey Fierstein, and Stevie Nicks.\n\nJanet Jackson, who twice was established as one of the highest-paid recording artists in the history of contemporary music during the 1990s, became a gay icon after she released her sixth studio album \"The Velvet Rope\" (1997). The album was honored by the National Black Lesbian and Gay Leadership Forum and received the award for Outstanding Music Album at the 9th Annual GLAAD Media Awards in 1998 for its songs that dealt with sexual orientation and homophobia. On April 26, 2008, she received the Vanguard Award—a media award from the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation—to honor her work in the entertainment industry in promoting equality for LGBT people. GLAAD President Neil G. Giuliano commented, \"Ms. Jackson has a tremendous following inside the LGBT community and out, and having her stand with us against the defamation that LGBT people still face in our country is extremely significant.\"\n\nDeborah Cox quickly becomes a gay icon due to her investment for the fight against the AIDS but also and especially thanks to club remixes included in her singles, which are frequently played in the discothèques.\n\nWriter, composer and singer, Ysa Ferrer is regarded as the French \"Kylie\". Her dance/electro style, called \"Pop Kosmic\" is very popular in France and Russia especially in the gay community where she is considered as a true icon.\n\nGlenn Close was established as a gay icon after portraying Margarethe Cammermeyer in \"\" (1995). She gained more recognition through her campy portrayal of the glamorous Cruella de Vil in \"101 Dalmatians\" (1996) and as the fading diva Norma Desmond in the Broadway musical \"Sunset Boulevard\".\n\nGarth Brooks, whose sister is openly lesbian, was one of the first non-LGBT male artists to openly back gay rights, and later same-sex marriage.\n\nThe Spice Girls became gay icons during the 1990s, on account of their dance-pop sound, flamboyant outfits, outgoing personalities and affirmations of equality. Geri Halliwell, in particular, went on to become a gay icon in her own right during her solo career in the 2000s, covering The Weather Girls' classic gay anthem, \"It's Raining Men\". In 2016, Halliwell received the Honorary Gay Award at the annual Attitude Awards.\n\nThe main single of I Turn to You by Melanie C, which became a gay anthem, was released as the \"Hex Hector Radio Mix\", for which Hex Hector won the 2001 Grammy as Remixer of the Year.\n\nFollowing her \"Ride It\" single in 2004, which became a gay anthem, Geri Halliwell confirms her gay icon status.\n\nKylie Minogue reinvented herself musically in the first decade of the 21st century and found herself faced with a renewed and increasing gay fanbase. She said, \"My gay audience has been with me from the beginning ... they kind of adopted me.\" Minogue first became aware of her gay audience in 1988, when several drag queens performed to her music at a Sydney pub, and she later saw a similar show in Melbourne. Minogue felt \"very touched\" to have such an \"appreciative crowd,\" and this encouraged her to perform at gay venues throughout the world, as well as headlining Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. Her sister, Dannii Minogue, also has a large gay following and has been regarded a gay icon.\n\nIrish actress and television presenter Carrie Crowley, best known abroad for presenting the Eurovision Song Contest 1997, has also been cited as a gay icon.\n\nAs a result of her role playing Karen Walker on \"Will & Grace\", Megan Mullally emerged as a gay icon. One commentator wrote that the show \"won the actress an impressive gay following, both with men and women, who want to be her and with her.\"\n\nThe television series \"Sex and the City\" was popular among gay men and spawned gay icons Sarah Jessica Parker and Kim Cattrall.\n\nChristina Aguilera is regarded a gay icon, a status that came following the release of the song \"Beautiful\", which became a gay anthem and was recognized as \"the most empowering song for lesbian, gay and bisexual people of the decade.\" The accompanying video featured people who can feel ostracised from society, including a same-sex couple and a transgender woman. Aguilera also was honored with the very first spot on The Abbey's Gay Walk of Fame for her contributions to gay culture, re-enforcing the title of gay icon she earned a decade ago with her anthem \"Beautiful\".\n\nMelanie Brown was shown kissing another woman in her \"For Once in My Life\" video, making this song a hymn of the gay community.\n\nPopular singers including Celine Dion, Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Lily Allen, Lana Del Rey, Marina and The Diamonds, P!nk, Beyoncé, Mariah Carey, Miley Cyrus, Ariana Grande, Kesha, Jennifer Lopez, Sia, Britney Spears, Rihanna, Carly Rae Jepsen, Nicki Minaj, Demi Lovato, Kelly Clarkson, and Katy Perry are notable gay icons of current times.\n\nMany famous actors have been celebrated as gay icons, including supermodel Tyra Banks, Kathy Griffin, Jessica Lange, Angela Lansbury, Carrie Fisher, Lucy Lawless, Mo'Nique, Maggie Smith. Meryl Streep became a gay icon after portraying Miranda Priestly in the film \"The Devil Wears Prada\".\n\nVarious LGBT celebrities have been embraced as gay icons after opening up about their sexual orientation as media professionals and public figures, including Eric Andre, Lance Bass, Ellen DeGeneres, Neil Patrick Harris, Elton John, Adam Lambert, Ricky Martin, Wentworth Miller, Rosie O'Donnell, Frank Ocean, RuPaul, George Takei, Ian McKellen, Christina Hendricks, Sarah Paulson, Harry Styles, and Hayley Kiyoko.\n\nBen Cohen, Jason Collins, Greg Louganis, Martina Navratilova, Billie Jean King, Tom Daley, Robbie Rogers, Michael Sam, Brian Boitano and Gareth Thomas, are considered gay icons within the sports industry.\n\nIn the political arena, gay icons are represented by, among others, Empress Elisabeth of Austria, Diana, Princess of Wales, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Pedro Zerolo, Brian Sims, Ann Coulter, George Moscone, Coretta Scott King, Abraham Lincoln, Winnie Mandela, Tony Blair, Hillary Clinton, Imelda Marcos, Eva Perón, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir, the first openly lesbian head of government of the modern era. Roger Casement, an Irish civil rights activist, became a gay icon of the early 20th century. Civil rights activist Coretta Scott King was held in high regard among members of the gay community for her involvement in the Gay Rights Movement. During her lifetime, she routinely equated the goals of the Civil Rights Movement, led by her late husband Martin Luther King Jr., with that of LGBT activism.\n\nSan Francisco City Supervisor Harvey Milk was the first openly gay man to be elected to office in the U.S. and spearheaded the defeat of statewide anti-gay ballot measure Proposition 6 in California in 1978. While he and Moscone were assassinated shortly thereafter, both became viewed as martyrs for gay rights. Milk's image as a positive role model led to him becoming the namesake for the first high school designed primarily for gay teenagers, the Harvey Milk High School, in the East Village of New York City. The portrayal of those efforts in the critically acclaimed film \"Milk\" earned Sean Penn an Oscar and comparisons to the contemporary battle over the anti-gay ballot initiative Proposition 8 raging in California at the time of the film's release in 2008.\n\nAn ironic icon is Anita Bryant, who worked to oppose homosexuality. During the 1970s, Bryant led a national campaign, \"Save Our Children\", that conflated homosexuality and pedophilia and insisted that, because homosexuals cannot reproduce, they must \"recruit\" or \"convert\" people to their lifestyle. California State Senator John V. Briggs applauded Bryant's work as a \"national, religious crusade [and] courageous stand to protect American children from blatant homosexuality\". However, as Bruce C. Steele of \"The Advocate\" wrote, Bryant's crusade against the Gay Rights Movement made her synonymous with it.\n\nAccording to John Coppola, exhibit curator and former head of exhibits at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC, \"In a completely unintended way, Anita Bryant was about the best thing to happen to the gay rights movement ... She and her cohorts were so over the top that it just completely galvanized the gay rights movement\". The 30th anniversary of Bryant's campaign against LGBT rights has been commemorated at the Stonewall Library & Archives, with executive director Jack Rutland dubbing her \"The Mother of Gay Rights\".\n\nVarious fictional characters have been regarded as gay icons, including cartoon figures. Bugs Bunny, a fictional anthropomorphic rabbit appearing in animation by Warner Bros. Cartoons during the Golden Age of American animation—dubbed the greatest cartoon character of all time by \"TV Guide\"—has been declared a \"queer cultural icon [and] parodic diva\" due to his \"cross-dressing antics\" and camp appeal.\n\nSome comic book characters are considered gay icons. Homosexual interpretations of Batman and the original Robin, Dick Grayson, have been of interest in cultural and academic study, due primarily to psychologist Fredric Wertham's \"Seduction of the Innocent\" (1954). In the mid-1950s, Wertham led a national campaign against comic books, convincing Americans that they were responsible for corrupting children and encouraging them to engage in acts of sex and violence. In relation to Batman and Robin, Wertham asserted \"the Batman type of story helps to fixate homoerotic tendencies by suggesting the form of an adolescent-with-adult or Ganymede-Zeus type of love-relationship\".\n\nIn \"Containing America: Cultural Production and Consumption in Fifties America\", authors Nathan Abrams and Julie Hughes point out that homosexual interpretations of Batman and Robin existed prior to Wertham's \"Seduction of the Innocent\". Wertham claimed his book was, in fact, prompted by the earlier research of a California psychiatrist. The relationship between Batman and arch villain the Joker has also been interpreted by many as homoerotic. Frank Miller, author of \"The Dark Knight Returns\", has described the relationship between Batman and the Joker as a \"homophobic nightmare,\" and views the character as sublimating his sexual urges into crime fighting, concluding, \"He'd be much healthier if he were gay.\"\n\nOne TV series that appeals most to LGBT culture is the 1960s sitcom \"Bewitched\". Aside from the campy characterizations, it contained three gay cast members (Dick Sargent, Paul Lynde and—allegedly—Agnes Moorehead). Star Elizabeth Montgomery and Sargent were grand marshals of a Los Angeles gay pride parade in the early 1990s. Another example is Bianca Montgomery of \"All My Children\".\n\nMany celebrities have responded positively to being regarded as gay icons, several noting the loyalty of their gay fans. Eartha Kitt and Cher credited gay fans with keeping them going at times when their careers had faltered. Kylie Minogue has acknowledged the perception of herself as a gay icon and has performed at such events as the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. Asked to explain the reason for her large gay fanbase, Minogue replied, \"It's always difficult for me to give the definitive answer because I don't have it. My gay audience has been with me from the beginning ... they kind of adopted me.\" She noted that she differed from many gay icons who were seen as tragic figures, with the comment, \"I've had a lot of tragic hairdos and outfits. I think that makes up for it!\"\n\nTammy Faye Messner (ex-wife of fellow controversial televangelist Jim Bakker and mother of pastor Jay Bakker), who benevolently has been referred to as \"the ultimate drag queen,\"  said in her last interview with Larry King that, \"When I went—when we lost everything, it was the gay people that came to my rescue, and I will always love them for that.\"\n\nOthers have been more ambivalent. Mae West, a gay icon from the early days of her career, supported gay rights but bristled when her performance style was referred to as camp.\n\nMadonna has acknowledged and embraced her gay following throughout her career, even making several references to the gay community in her songs or performances, and performed at several gay clubs. She has declared in interviews that some of her best friends are gay and that she adores gay people and refers to herself as \"the biggest gay icon of all times.\" She also has been quoted in television interviews in the early 1990s as declaring the \"big problem in America at the time was homophobia.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1004355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1004355", "title": "Gilbert Ryle", "text": "Gilbert Ryle\n\nGilbert Ryle (19 August 1900 – 6 October 1976) was a British philosopher. He was a representative of the generation of British ordinary language philosophers who shared Wittgenstein's approach to philosophical problems, and is principally known for his critique of Cartesian dualism, for which he coined the phrase \"the ghost in the machine.\" Some of his ideas in the philosophy of mind have been referred to as \"behaviourist.\" Ryle's best known book is \"The Concept of Mind\" (1949), in which he writes that the \"general trend of this book will undoubtedly, and harmlessly, be stigmatised as 'behaviourist'.\" Ryle, having engaged in detailed study of the key works of Bernard Bolzano, Franz Brentano, Alexius Meinong, Edmund Husserl, and Martin Heidegger, himself suggested instead that the book \"could be described as a sustained essay in phenomenology, if you are at home with that label.\"\n\nRyle was born in Brighton, England, in 1900, and grew up in an environment of learning. His father was a Brighton doctor, a generalist who had interests in philosophy and astronomy, and passed on to his children an impressive library. Ryle was educated at Brighton College, and in 1919 he went up to The Queen's College at Oxford to study Classics but was quickly drawn to Philosophy. He graduated with a \"triple first\": first-class honours in classical honour moderations (1921), \"literae humaniores\" (1923), and politics, philosophy, and economics (1924), and was appointed as lecturer in philosophy at Christ Church, Oxford in 1925. A year later, he became a Student (Fellow) and tutor at Christ Church, where he remained until 1940.\n\nIn World War II he was commissioned in the Welsh Guards. A capable linguist, he was recruited into intelligence work and by the end of the war had been promoted to the rank of Major. After the war he returned to Oxford and was elected Waynflete Professor of Metaphysical Philosophy and Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford. He published his principal work, \"The Concept of Mind\" in 1949. He was President of the Aristotelian Society from 1945 to 1946, and editor of the philosophical journal \"Mind\" from 1947 to 1971. Ryle died on 6 October 1976 at Whitby, North Yorkshire.\n\nHis brothers John Alfred (1889–1950) and George Bodley (1902–1978), both educated at Brighton College as well, also had eminent careers. John became Regius Professor of Physic at the University of Cambridge 1935–45 and physician to King George V. George, after serving as Director of Forestry first for Wales and then England, was Deputy-Director of the Forestry Commission 1963–65 and appointed a CBE.\n\nIn \"The Concept of Mind\", Ryle argues that dualism involves category mistakes and philosophical nonsense. Category mistakes and nonsense as philosophical topics continued to inform Ryle's work. Students in his 1967-8 Oxford audience would be asked rhetorically what was wrong with saying that there are three things in a field: two cows and a pair of cows. They were also invited to ponder whether the bung-hole of a beer barrel is part of the barrel or not.\n\nRyle thought it was no longer possible to believe that it was a philosopher's task to study mental as opposed to physical objects. However, in its place, Ryle saw the tendency of philosophers to search for objects whose nature was neither physical nor mental. Ryle believed, instead, that \"philosophical problems are problems of a certain sort; they are not problems of an ordinary sort about special entities.\"\n\nRyle offers the analogy of philosophy as being like cartography. Competent speakers of a language, Ryle believes, are to a philosopher what ordinary villagers are to a mapmaker. The ordinary villager has a competent grasp of his village, and is familiar with its inhabitants and geography. However, when asked to interpret a map for the same knowledge he has practically, the villager will have difficulty until he is able to translate his practical knowledge into universal cartographal terms. The villager thinks of the village in personal and practical terms, while the mapmaker thinks of the village in neutral, public, cartographical terms.\n\nBy \"mapping\" the words and phrases of a particular statement, philosophers are able to generate what Ryle calls \"implication threads.\" In other words, each word or phrase of a statement contributes to the statement in that, if the words or phrases were changed, the statement would have a different implication. The philosopher must show the directions and limits of different implication threads that a \"concept contributes to the statements in which it occurs.\" To show this, he must be \"tugging\" at neighbouring threads, which, in turn, must also be \"tugging.\" Philosophy, then, searches for the meaning of these implication threads in the statements in which they are used.\n\nA distinction deployed in \"The Concept of Mind\", between knowing-how and knowing-that (e.g., knowing how to tie a reef knot and knowing that Queen Victoria died in 1901), has attracted independent interest. This distinction is also the origin of procedural (knowing-how) and declarative (knowing-that) models of long term memory.\n\nRyle took a narrow view of the scope of his field. For him, philosophy did not extend beyond the philosophy of mind, philosophical logic, and the philosophy of language. Ethics, political philosophy, and aesthetics were 'philosophy' only by a strained courtesy and a burdensome historical tradition.\n\nRyle's notion of thick description, from \"The Thinking of Thoughts: What is 'Le Penseur' Doing?\" and \"Thinking and Reflecting\", has been an important influence on cultural anthropologists such as Clifford Geertz.\n\"The Concept of Mind\" was recognised on its appearance as an important contribution to philosophical psychology, and an important work in the ordinary language philosophy movement. However, in the 1960s and 1970s the rising influence of the cognitivist theories of Noam Chomsky, Herbert A. Simon, Jerry Fodor and others in the neo-Cartesian school became predominant. Chomsky even wrote a book entitled \"Cartesian Linguistics\". The two major post-War schools in the philosophy of mind, the representationalism of Jerry Fodor and the functionalism of Wilfrid Sellars, posited precisely the 'internal' cognitive states that Ryle had argued against. However, as influential modern philosopher and former student Daniel Dennett has pointed out, recent trends in psychology such as embodied cognition, discursive psychology, situated cognition and others in the post-cognitivist tradition have provoked a renewed interest in Ryle's work. Dennett has provided a sympathetic foreword to the 2000 edition of \"The Concept of Mind\". Ryle remains a significant defender of the possibility of lucid and meaningful interpretation of higher-level human activities without recourse to an immaterial soul.\n\nRichard Webster endorsed Ryle's arguments against mentalist philosophies, suggesting that they implied that \"theories of human nature which repudiate the evidence of behaviour and refer solely or primarily to invisible mental events will never in themselves be able to unlock the most significant mysteries of human nature.\"\n\n\n"}

Boaistuau selected from Bandello six most dark and gorey stories and changed them for his means. He was followed by François de Belleforest who adapted 12 more stories for the new edition in 1570.\n\nThose dark mood stories were imitated by writers like Jacques Yver (\"Le Printemps d’Yver\", 1572), Vérité Habanc (\"Nouvelles Histoires tant tragiques que comiques\", 1585), Bénigne Poissenot (\"Nouvelles Histoires Tragiques\", 1586), Alexandre Sylvain (\"Epitomes de cent histoires tragicques\", 1581), and Bruneau de Rivedoux (\"Histoire véritable de certains voyages périlleux et hasardeux sur la mer\", 1599).\n\nFrançois de Rosset began to borrow plots for his tragic stories from contemporary crime chronicle (\"Les Histoires tragiques de nostre temps\", 1615), and this innovation proved to be extremely popular.\n\nAnother important author is Jean-Pierre Camus who adds infernal and diabolical theme.\n"}
{"id": "273856", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=273856", "title": "Industrial society", "text": "Industrial society\n\nIn sociology, an industrial society is a society driven by the use of technology to enable mass production, supporting a large population with a high capacity for division of labour. Such a structure developed in the Western world in the period of time following the Industrial Revolution, and replaced the agrarian societies of the pre-modern, pre-industrial age. Industrial societies are generally mass societies, and may be succeeded by an information society. They are often contrasted with traditional societies.\n\nIndustrial societies use external energy sources, such as fossil fuels, to increase the rate and scale of production. The production of food is shifted to large commercial farms where the products of industry, such as combine harvesters and fossil fuel based fertilizers, are used to decrease required human labor while increasing production. No longer needed for the production of food, excess labor is moved into these factories where mechanization is utilized to further increase efficiency. As populations grow, and mechanization is further refined, often to the level of automation, many workers shift to expanding service industries.\n\nIndustrial society makes urbanization desirable, in part so that workers can be closer to centers of production, and the service industry can provide labor to workers and those that benefit financially from them, in exchange for a piece of production profits with which they can buy goods. This leads to the rise of very large cities and surrounding suburban areas with a high rate of economic activity.\n\nThese urban centers require the input of external energy sources in order to overcome the diminishing returns of agricultural consolidation, due partially to the lack of nearby arable land, associated transportation and storage costs, and are otherwise unsustainable. This makes the reliable availability of the needed energy resources high priority in industrial government policies.\n\nSome theoreticians (namely Ulrich Beck, Anthony Giddens, and Manuel Castells) argue that we are located in the middle of a transformation or transition from industrial societies to post-industrial societies. The triggering technology for the change from an agricultural to an industrial organisation was steam power, allowing mass production and reducing the agricultural work necessary. Thus, many industrial cities have been built around rivers. Identified as catalyst or trigger for the transition to post-modern or informational society is global information technology.\n\nSome, such as Theodore Kaczynski, have argued that an industrialized society leads to psychological pain and that citizens must actively work to return to a more primitive society. His essay, \"Industrial Society and Its Future\", describes different political factions and laments the direction of technology and the modern world.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "557762", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=557762", "title": "Justify My Love", "text": "Justify My Love\n\n\"Justify My Love\" is a song by American singer Madonna from her first greatest hits compilation album \"The Immaculate Collection\" (1990). It was released on October 30, 1990, by Sire Records as the lead single from \"The Immaculate Collection\". The song was written by Lenny Kravitz and Ingrid Chavez, with additional lyrics by Madonna. Chavez was not credited on the song, which led to a lawsuit against Kravitz. Chavez settled out-of-court, the terms of which included a songwriting credit. Madonna's vocals are primarily spoken and whispered, but almost never sung, a style which she again employed on her following studio album \"Erotica\" (1992).\n\nMusically, \"Justify My Love\" is a trip hop inspired song, with mid-tempo settings and instrumentation. The lyrics of the song are primarily about sex and romance. \"Justify My Love\" received mixed reviews from older critics, but was critically appreciated by many contemporary critics, noting it as one of Madonna's best songs to date. The song became Madonna's ninth number one single on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, while reaching the Top 10 in several countries including Australia, Canada, Finland, New Zealand, Italy, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe accompanying music video portrayed Madonna as a woman walking in a hotel hallway, looking distressed and tired from work, until being seduced into having sex with a mysterious man and woman. It caused controversy worldwide, due to its explicit sexual images, and was subsequently banned from MTV and other TV networks. The video, which contained imagery of sadomasochism, voyeurism, and bisexuality, made its US television debut December 3, 1990 on ABC during its late-night news program \"Nightline\". The song was part of the setlist of three of her concert tours, the most recent being The MDNA Tour in 2012.\n\n\"Justify My Love\" was originally written and recorded by Ingrid Chavez, Prince's protégé and friend, and Lenny Kravitz: he and producer André Betts composed the music while Chavez penned the lyrics based on a poem she had written for Kravitz, and read them aloud. Kravitz added the title hook and chorus to the demo while Madonna corrected one line. Chavez was not credited for the song and later sued Kravitz in 1992: she received an out-of-court settlement, and gained a co-writing credit for her work. When the lawsuit was settled, Chavez's attorney Steven E. Kurtz clarified that Madonna's additional writing credit was not questioned in the lawsuit. The song was released on November 6, 1990, three days before the release of the compilation. \n\nProducer Kravitz used the drums found on Public Enemy's instrumental, \"Security of the First World\", without consent, which was in turn based on the end drum break of James Brown's \"Funky Drummer\", and used it as the basis of the song. The song was unusual in that Madonna's vocals are primarily spoken and whispered, but almost never sung. This style served as a prelude to her next album \"Erotica\", in which she spoke the lyrics on some of the songs rather than singing them. Kravitz and Madonna provided background vocals. Chavez' had previously provided the \"spoken intro\" to Prince's 1988 song \"Eye No\", and Chavez' vocal style on her 1991 debut album has been described as \"breathy spoken passages\".\n\nComposed as a midtempo song, \"Justify My Love\" is a trip hop-inspired song. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, the song is set in common time, with a tempo of 100 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of B minor with Madonna's voice ranging from the tonal nodes of A to D. According to Jim Farber from \"Entertainment Weekly\", he described the song's musical beat and Madonna's vocals as \"vague, tuneless phrases chanted in Madonna's most breathless voice over a minimal house groove — serves mainly to justify the visuals.\" In a review for \"The Immaculate Collection\", David Browne said that she introduced an \"adult\" pop. The song features \"heavy breathing with a backbeat.\" Robert Christgau had compared the song composition to the songs on Madonna's \"Erotica\" album. Bill Lamb from \"About.com\" said the song is \"quite powerful and enthralling in its dreamy, beat heavy celebration of carnal coupling.\"\n\nMadonna and Lenny Kravitz remixed the song and named it \"The Beast Within\". It was included on the 12\" vinyl and CD maxi-single release in North America. The remix uses only the chorus and certain lines of the original song, with the verses being replaced by passages from the Book of Revelation. Subsequent live concert performances have simply billed the song as \"The Beast Within\", a song in its own right, it is now no longer referred to as a remix. The song first garnered media attention early in 1991 when the Simon Wiesenthal Center accused the song of containing anti-semitic lyrics; specifically the lyric \"those who say that they are Jews, but they are not. They are a Synagogue of Satan\".\n\n\"Justify My Love\" received acclaim from many music critics. In a separate review from Allmusic, they gave the song four-and-a-half stars out of five, stating \"[Justify My Love] stands as one of the best of Madonna's long history of well-packaged maxi-singles, and further helped set a precedent for the maxi-single market.\" In a review from \"Entertainment Weekly\" by David Browne, he gave it a positive remark saying that people who have a \"hoo-haa\" surrounding the banning of the single \"underestimate her\". \"Rolling Stone\" had said along with \"Rescue Me\" are \"worthy sensual newies\". While reviewing \"Celebration\", Bill Lamb from \"About.com\" said \"Songs such as \"Justify My Love\" that sounded a little over-indulgent when first released have worn very well over time.\" Alexandra Capotorto from PopCrush.com said \"'Justify My Love' is perfectly constructed lovemaking music. While this track might be oozing sex, it's the NSFW music video that caused the most drama [...]\"\n\nIn the United States, \"Justify My Love\" peaked at number one for two weeks on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 singles chart. It also topped the \"Billboard\" Hot Dance Club Play charts and peaked at number 42 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The RIAA certified it platinum on February 22, 1991 for sales of over a million units. On 1991's \"Billboard\" Hot 100 year-end chart \"Justify My Love\" was allocated the number 21 spot.\n\nThe song received massive success in Europe as well. In the United Kingdom the single reached number two and was certified silver by the BPI on December 1, 1990. According to The Official Charts Company, the song has sold 235,000 copies in the UK. The song debuted at number 16 on the Swedish Singles Chart, eventually peaking at number eight for one week. In Norway, the song entered the chart at number seven and peaked at number three for one week, staying on the chart for nine weeks. The song entered at number 79 on the Dutch Top 40, peaking at number five. The song entered the French Singles Chart at number 42, and peaked at number 17, staying on the chart for 11 weeks.\nThe song also peaked at number nine in Austria and number three in Switzerland.\n\nThe song was also successful in the Oceanic region. It debuted at number 14 in the Australian Singles Chart, peaking at number four. It was present on the chart for 14 weeks and was certified Gold by the ARIA. It debuted at number 22 on the New Zealand Singles Chart, peaking at number five for two consecutive weeks. It was present on the New Zealand chart for a total of 16 weeks.\n\nThe music video for \"Justify My Love\" was directed in Paris on November 9, 1990 by Jean-Baptiste Mondino, who had also worked with Madonna in her video for \"Open Your Heart\". It features Madonna's then-boyfriend, model and actor Tony Ward. Some of the dancers featured in the video were also dancers from her Blond Ambition World Tour. It is a tribute to Jeanne Moreau of \"La Baie des Anges\". In 2013, she declared it her favorite music video.\n\nThe video was filmed in grainy black and white in the style of a 1960s European art film. There are also several shadowy film-noir elements such as characters seen only in silhouette. The action takes place in an elegant hotel that apparently caters to alternate lifestyle couples. Madonna (or the character she's playing) enters looking tired and distressed as she walks down the hallway toward her room. There she has a romantic fling with a mysterious man (played by Tony Ward). Some of the doors to the other rooms are ajar and we catch glimpses of various couples cavorting in BDSM fetish outfits (leather, PVC T-shirts, latex underwear, and corsets).\n\nIn a dream-like sequence, Madonna rolls around in bed wearing skimpy lace underwear and a garter belt and stockings while various figures come and go. The entire nudity (which led to the video being banned) occurs when a topless dominatrix-type woman, played by model Wallis Franken—suspenders partly covering her breasts—appears and roughly grabs a bound man (the same man who is with Madonna) by the hair. Her outfit, which includes a peaked leather hat and black gloves, copies the ensemble worn by Charlotte Rampling in the controversial film \"The Night Porter\". (Both the film and the video share elements of sadomasochism.) The theme of androgyny is also briefly alluded to when a woman who closely resembles Madonna's lover is seen in men's clothing with a drawn-on pencil mustache. The overall presentation is surreal and deliberately ambiguous. The retinue of strange characters may be real or simply fantasies from Madonna's imagination. In the end, a rejuvenated Madonna rushes out of the hotel room smiling and laughing.\n\nThe video was deemed too sexually explicit for MTV and was banned from the network. Madonna responded to the banning: \"Why is it that people are willing to go and watch a movie about someone getting blown to bits for no reason at all, and nobody wants to see two girls kissing and two men snuggling?\" On December 3, 1990, ABC's \"Nightline\" played the video in its entirety, then interviewed Madonna live about the video's sexual content and censorship. When asked whether she stood to make more money selling the video than airing it on MTV, she appeared impatient and answered, \"Yeah, so? Lucky me.\" She also expressed during the interview that she did not understand why MTV banned the video yet allowed videos that contained violence and degradation to women to continue receiving regular airplay. The video was then released in VHS, and became a bestselling \"video single\".\n\nThe video for \"Justify My Love\" was banned also from regular rotation on MuchMusic in Canada, although the controversy (as well as the subsequent banning of a video by Mitsou) led MuchMusic to launch a new series, \"Too Much 4 Much\", which played controversial music videos accompanied by panel discussions on their artistic and cultural context. In 2002, the video was aired in its entirety on MTV2 as part of a special countdown showing the most controversial videos ever to air on MTV. This countdown was shown only late at night because of the graphic imagery of \"Justify My Love\" and several other videos on the countdown.\n\nAlthough many complaints were received, the video was played without restriction on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's popular music video show Rage; as, being a public broadcaster, the ABC is not bound to follow classification guidelines\n\n\"Justify My Love\" was the first VHS video single to be released by Madonna. This was the first time an artist had released a single in this format. Released on VHS only, the packaging in North America was a plain black slip cover with a sticker around it, so that it resembled a \"seedy video\". In Europe, it was given the full cover artwork treatment, and they also included a bonus video of Madonna's performance of \"Vogue\" at the 1990 MTV Music Video Awards, which was ironic as MTV had banned the title track. In the UK, the video was given an \"18\" certificate by the BBFC, meaning no one under that age could legally buy or see the release. At the time of its release, the video peaked at #2 on the Billboard's Top Music Videos Chart for two weeks and spent 39 weeks in the chart overall. The music video was released on DVD for the first time on the greatest hits package \"\" in 2009. This version of the video was censored with black bars in a scene that contains female nudity. In Australia, the video was rated \"M\" and in New Zealand, the video was rated \"R16\" for sex scenes.\n\nOn the May 11, 1991 episode of the sketch-comedy series \"Saturday Night Live\", Madonna made a guest appearance in a pre-filmed segment which spoofed her controversial music video as well as her just-released \"\" film.\n\nDuring a \"Wayne's World\" sketch, Wayne (Mike Myers) and Garth (Dana Carvey) encounter a seductive Madonna lying on a bed in a hotel room during a fantasy dream sequence (also filmed in black and white). After some back-and-forth banter, Wayne and Madonna play Truth or Dare. Wayne begins by saying \"Truth.\" Madonna then asks \"Have you ever made love with two women at the same time?\" Wayne answers \"Uh...yes!\" to which Madonna says \"Okay, I believe you...not!\" Wayne then dares Madonna to make out with him. As they kiss, the music for \"Justify My Love\" begins to play. Garth is then seen dancing in a parody of the video before being abducted by two women in fetish-wear outfits.\n\nMadonna performed the song twice during The Girlie Show World Tour in 1993, the original version and also the \"Beast Within remix\". The latter was used as a dancers interlude during the show. The \"remix\" was again used as the video introduction to the 2004 Re-Invention World Tour, including imagery of Madonna from the exhibition \"X-STaTIC Pro=CeSS\", prior to her appearing on stage. It was subsequently included on the 2006 live album, \"I'm Going to Tell You a Secret\". This new version omits the controversial lyrics which caused the 1991 accusations.\n\nThe song was remixed again by William Orbit and used on The MDNA Tour as a video interlude. The black-and-white backdrop video, directed by Tom Munro, features Madonna being chased by people in carnival masks and locks herself in a room to indulge into her fantasies, while the masked followers search for her. The video is said to be a metaphor for everybody trying to take advantage of her, judge her or exploit her private life, and the interlude is her expression of escaping the judgement.\n\nSamples of the song were also used during the SEX video/performance interlude on the Rebel Heart Tour.\n\n\"Justify My Love\" has remained one of Madonna's most controversial singles to date. As a result of all the controversy, the single was released as a video-single and went on to become the highest selling video single of all time, eventually becoming certified four-times platinum by the RIAA. In 2003, Madonna fans were asked to vote for their Top 20 Madonna singles of all time by \"Q\" magazine. \"Justify My Love\" was allocated the number 12 spot.\n\nBill Lamb from \"About.com\" had listed the song at number 21 on his \"The Biggest Madonna Songs\". He also made a list entitled \"Top 10 Madonna Music Videos\", where it ended up at number four. PopCrush.com had listed the song at number one on their \"Top 10 Sex Songs\". \"Billboard.com\" had listed the song at number five on their Madonna's 40 Biggest Billboard Hits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\"|Physical\n\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\"|Longform Video\n"}

{"id": "39845988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39845988", "title": "Knowledge society", "text": "Knowledge society\n\nA knowledge society generates, shares and makes available to all members of the society knowledge that may be used to improve the human condition. A knowledge society differs from an information society in that the former serves to transform information into resources that allow society to take effective action while the latter only creates and disseminates the raw data. The capacity to gather and analyze information has existed throughout human history. However, the idea of the present-day knowledge society is based on the vast increase in data creation and information dissemination that results from the innovation of information technologies. The UNESCO World Report addresses the definition, content and future of knowledge societies.\n\nThe growth of Information and communication technology (ICT) has significantly increased the world’s capacity for creation of raw data and the speed at which it is produced. The advent of the Internet delivered unheard-of quantities of information to people. The evolution of the internet from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 offered individuals tools to connect with each other worldwide as well as become content users and producers. Innovation in digital technologies and mobile devices offers individuals a means to connect anywhere anytime where digital technologies are accessible. Tools of ICT have the potential to transform education, training, employment and access to life-sustaining resources for all members of society.\nHowever, this capacity for individuals to produce and use data on a global scale does not necessarily result in knowledge creation. Contemporary media delivers seemingly endless amounts of information and yet, the information alone does not create knowledge. For knowledge creation to take place, reflection is required to create awareness, meaning and understanding. The improvement of human circumstances requires critical analysis of information to develop the knowledge that assists humankind. Absent reflection and critical thinking, information can actually become \"non-knowledge\", that which is false or inaccurate. The anticipated Semantic Web 3.0 and Ubiquitous Web 4.0 will move both information and knowledge creation forward in their capacities to use intelligence to digitally create meaning independent of user-driven ICT.\n\nThe social theory of a knowledge society explains how knowledge is fundamental to the politics, economics, and culture of modern society. Associated ideas include the knowledge economy created by economists and the learning society created by educators. Knowledge is a commodity to be traded for economic prosperity. In a knowledge society, individuals, communities, and organizations produce knowledge-intensive work. Peter Drucker viewed knowledge as a key economic resource and coined the term knowledge worker in 1969. Fast forward to the present day, and in this knowledge-intensive environment, knowledge begets knowledge, new competencies develop, and the result is innovation. \nA knowledge society promotes human rights and offers equal, inclusive, and universal access to all knowledge creation. The UNESCO World Report establishes four principles that are essential for development of an equitable knowledge society:\n\nHowever, they acknowledge that the digital divide is an obstacle to achievement of genuine knowledge societies. Access to the internet is available to 39 percent of the world’s population. This statistic represents growth as well as a continued gap. Among the many challenges that contribute to a global digital divide are issues regarding economic resources, geography, age, gender, language, education, social and cultural background, employment and disabilities.\n\nTo reduce the span of the digital divide, leaders and policymakers worldwide must first develop and understanding of knowledge societies and second, create and deploy initiatives that will universally benefit all populations. The public expects politicians and public institutions to act rationally and rely on relevant knowledge for decision-making. Yet, in many cases, there are no definitive answers for some of the issues that impact humankind. Science is no longer viewed as the provider of unquestionable knowledge and sometimes raises more uncertainty in its search for knowledge. The very advancement of knowledge creates the existence of increased ignorance or non-knowledge. This means that public policy must learn to manage doubt, probability, risk and uncertainty while making the best decisions possible.\n\nTo confront the uncertainty that comes from an increase in both knowledge and the resulting lack of knowledge, members of a society disagree and make decisions using justification and observation of consequences. Public policy may operate with the intent to prevent the worst possible outcome versus find the perfect solution. Democratization of expert knowledge occurs when a knowledge society produces and relies on more experts. Expert knowledge is no longer exclusive to certain individuals, professional or organizations. If in a knowledge society, knowledge is a public good to which all people have access, any individual may also serve as a creator of knowledge and receive credit as an expert. Since politicians rely on expert knowledge for decision making, the layperson who may lack specialized knowledge might hold a view that serves as expertise to the political process.\n\nAs technologies are deployed to improve global information access, the role of education will continue to grow and change. Education is viewed as a basic human right. For a society where reading and counting are a requisite for daily living, skills in reading, writing, and basic arithmetic are critical for future learning. However, in a knowledge society, education is not restricted to school. The advent of ICT allows learners to seek information and develop knowledge at any time and any place where access is available and unrestricted. In these circumstances, the skill of learning to learn is one of the most important tools to help people acquire formal and informal education. In a knowledge society supported by ICT, the ability to locate, classify and sort information is essential. Equipped with this skill, the use of ICT becomes an active versus a passive endeavor and integral to literacy and lifelong learning.\n\nOne marker of a knowledge society is continuous innovation that demands lifelong learning, knowledge development, and knowledge sharing. The institution of education will need to become responsive to changing demands. Education professionals will need to learn along with everyone else, and as leaders of changing designs in learning, they will serve as a bridge between technology and teaching. The ability to individually reflect on personal learning requirements and seek knowledge in whatever method is appropriate characterizes lifelong learning. One model that supports this type of learning is the W. Edwards Deming Plan-do-check-act cycle that promotes continuous improvement. Educational professionals will need to prepare learners to be accountable for their own lifelong learning.\n\n"}

He notes, \"If 118 women had been killed, alarm bells regarding discrimination against women would probably have gone off around the world.\" He notes that able-bodied males were viewed as a more legitimate target during wars in Bosnia, Kosovo, Timor, Rwanda, and Chechnya.\n\nIvana Milojević notes that while patriarchy assigns the role of sex object to women, it assigns to men the role of violence-object, with male expendability being corollary to the sexual objectification of girls. Films such as \"They Were Expendable\" or \"The Expendables\" often are about all-male combat teams. Michael D. Clark notes that Adolf Hitler considered gay men expendable by means of Nazi concentration camps and Nazi medical experiments. Manosphere critics of feminism have argued that poor and working-class men \"are cannon fodder abroad and expendable labor at home, trapped beneath a glass floor in jobs nobody really wants—farm workers, roofers, garbage men—and injured at far higher rates than women\". Walter Block argues in \"The Case for Discrimination\" that male expendability is the result of women's being the bottleneck of reproductive capacity in a population. This theme was echoed in Warren Farrell's \"The Myth of Male Power\".\n\n"}
{"id": "5090652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5090652", "title": "Maximums", "text": "Maximums\n\nThe Maximums is a DC Comics team of super heroes parodying Marvel Comics's Ultimates and New Avengers, including the lower-case speech bubbles associated with the Ultimate Universe and the Avengers' battlecry \"Avengers Assemble!\" to their \"Maximums March!\" They are based in San Francisco.\n\nThey were introduced in \"Superman/Batman\" #20 (June 2005) as inhabitants of an alternate world. It was eventually revealed they had been created by the Joker and Mr. Mxyzptlk.\n\nThe Maximums were creations of the Joker and Mr. Mxyzptlk. They imagined a U.S. government sanctioned superhero team from a parallel world.\n\nDuring in the middle of a battle with the Axis of Evil, the Maximums encountered Superman and Batman from an alternate timeline, whom they claimed that Skyscraper murdered their Lois Lane. Superman kills Skyscraper and after the ensuing battle with the Maximums, escape via Boom Tube. With mysterious information provided by their fallen comrade, Bowman (who was actually impersonated by the Joker), the Maximums track Superman and Batman to their reality.\n\nWhile Batman and Superman are fighting the Atomic Skull who was stealing a briefcase with radioactive materials in it from Wayne Tech, the Maximums appear, seeking revenge. The Soldier fires a bullet at the Skull, and it passes through Superman's hand and causing the Skull to violently release a large amount of radiation that Superman acts to contain. Although Robot observes Superman's heroic act, Viking will have none of it. Soldier and Monster attempt to subdue Batman when Batzarro intervened, blinding everyone with his \"smoke\" bombs. Eventually, the Maximums were able to capture Superman and Batman, and returned to their world via Boom Tube.\n\nAfter imprisoning Superman and Batman in Alcatraz prison, the Maximums were underestimated by the heroes who they then easily escaped their prison. Superman fought Viking and Robot, who the latter no longer believed that they murdered Skyscraper, while Batman was attacked and defeated by Wolfen. However, the Bowman/Joker visited Lex Luthor and returned to the Maximums reality and releases the Kryptonite Man into an imprisoned Batman, possessing him.\n\nThe Kryptonite Man-possessed Batman fought with Superman while the Maximums argued over their fate. Superman used Robot's exterior armor to encase K-Man and force him out of Batman's body. Immediately thereafter, Bizarro and Batzarro appeared and attempted to rescue their idols to safety, but only for Batzarro to be stranded in the Maximums' reality.\n\nBoth Joker and Mxy then anticipated in having the Maximums into battling various versions of Superman and Batman; Joker wanted to kill \"every Batman there ever was or there ever will be.\" while on Mxy's part planned in freeing Darkseid from the Source Wall. However, Mxy had orchestrated this game into not only freeing Darkseid but Bat-Mite as well as Mxy was unable to directly free his fellow 5th Dimensional imp, and had to have a creation of the Joker do it himself. He explained to Superman and Batman that they, Darkseid and himself will play a central role in an upcoming Crisis. With Mxy's plan came to fruition, the Maximums were ceased to exist.\n\nThe members include:\n\nApart from Batman and Superman, the team's greatest enemies are the Axis of Evil, parodying the Masters of Evil. The Axis members are Godiva (the Enchantress); Annihilate (The Executioner); Demise (the Grim Reaper); and Rapier (the Swordsman/the Black Knight).\n\nOther villains may include the Bug's archenemy Halloween (based on the Green Goblin), although the appearance of Halloween throwing Kristen off the Golden Gate Bridge (modeled after the death of Spider-Man's former girlfriend Gwen Stacy) turned out to be a ploy to distract Superman.\n\nHornet has commented that the team seems to spend most of the time fighting itself, most notably a battle with former member the Chaos Witch in which Bowman was killed (a reference to the Scarlet Witch and the events of \"Avengers Disassembled\").\n\nThe Maximums' Earth also includes a version of Ghost Rider named the Skull Biker, but nothing more is known about him, except that his powers are Satanic in origin.\n\nAdditionally, Captain Atom was briefly sent here as a result of an atomic explosion involving Kryptonite. While recuperating, he was delusional, glowing green, and destroyed several buildings. He was, essentially, this Earth's equivalent to the Radioactive Man.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "49988266", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49988266", "title": "Men Against Fire", "text": "Men Against Fire\n\n\"Men Against Fire\" is the fifth episode of the third series of British science fiction anthology series \"Black Mirror\". Written by series creator and showrunner Charlie Brooker and directed by Jakob Verbruggen, it premiered on Netflix on 21 October 2016, together with the rest of series three.\n\nThe episode, set in a future with dystopian and post-apocalyptic elements, tells the story of Stripe (Malachi Kirby), a soldier in a military organization hunting and exterminating mutants known as \"roaches\". When his squad, which also includes his friend and partner \"Hunter\" (Madeline Brewer) and their squad leader Medina (Sarah Snook), encounters roaches, Stripe kills two of them; despite earning praise for his performance, he starts feeling different. Ariane Labed and Michael Kelly co-star as a woman saved by Stripe and a military psychologist, respectively.\n\n\"Stripe\" Koinange (Malachi Kirby) and \"Hunter\" Raiman (Madeline Brewer) are squadmates in a military organization that hunts down and exterminates mutant humans, dubbed \"roaches\", in a post-apocalyptic future. Each soldier has a neural implant called MASS that enhances the processing of their senses (including sight, sound, and smell), provides instant data via augmented reality, and creates comforting sex dreams at night.\n\nStripe and Hunter's squad follows a lead to a farmhouse. The team searches the grounds while squad leader Medina (Sarah Snook) interrogates the farm's owner, a devout Christian (Francis Magee), whom she suspects is harbouring roaches in accord with his beliefs. Medina's suspicions are confirmed, as Stripe discovers a complete secret \"nest\" of roaches – revealed to be pale, snarling, humanoid monsters with sharp teeth; when one of them points a mysterious LED device at Stripe, he and Hunter open fire on them. Afterwards, Stripe picks up the LED device and accidentally flashes himself in the eyes. Medina arrests the owner and orders the farmhouse torched. The device Stripe flashed in his eyes appears to have disrupted his MASS interface, which sporadically glitches during his training regimens the following day. Stripe undergoes a physical examination and sees a psychologist, Arquette (Michael Kelly); neither visit reveals any medical problems.\n\nThe next day, Medina, Stripe and Hunter arrive at an abandoned housing complex to look for further roaches. Stripe experiences another glitch: his sense of smell, seemingly dampened, suddenly returns. In the very next moment, a roach sniper kills Medina. Stripe and Hunter scour the sniper's nest and Stripe encounters what he perceives to be a regular human woman. He urges the woman to flee but Hunter shoots her dead. In a subsequent firefight, it is clear that Stripe is seeing humans where Hunter sees roaches. Stripe attempts to stop Hunter from continuing the massacre and knocks her out, but gets injured and then escapes with a frightened woman (Ariane Labed) and her boy.\n\nThe fleeing woman, Catarina, explains that Stripe's MASS implant has altered his senses to disguise the fact that \"roaches\" are actually regular humans. In fact, roaches are the victims of a genocide against those believed to be genetically inferior, following a global war ten years before. Catarina remarks that soldiers have MASS but everyday civilians do not; they simply hate the roaches due to propaganda and prejudice. Hunter suddenly reappears, killing Catarina and her son and knocking Stripe unconscious.\n\nStripe awakes inside a military prison cell, where Arquette explains that the LED device had sent viral coding to Stripe's MASS, causing it to glitch so that he could see roaches as human beings. Arquette then reveals the true secret purpose of the MASS implants: to augment the visual appearance of the persecuted humans to make them look zombie-like and frightening, to alter their voices to sound like monstrous nonsensical growls, to diminish the smells of blood and gore, and to selectively erase certain memories. MASS is used by the military to dehumanize the appearance of the enemy, allowing soldiers to kill them more efficiently and without remorse. Stripe, it turns out, has been working for a global eugenics program to \"protect the bloodline\" of humanity, something Stripe passively agreed to. Though his memory of agreeing to this has been erased by MASS, Arquette confirms it with video footage, and he also plays the raw footage of Stripe's farmhouse mission, except the roaches' appearances have not been augmented to look like monsters and so it is indeed revealed that he has been killing terrified ordinary humans. Stripe pleads with him to stop the footage and Arquette threatens to imprison Stripe, endlessly looping the raw footage, if Stripe does not consent to wipe his memory of the last few days and get his MASS system reset.\n\nStripe is later shown being discharged with full military honors, implying he consented to a second erasure of his memory. He approaches what his eyes show to be an immaculate house and a waiting dream girl, but in actuality he stands alone outside a graffiti-tagged, dilapidated shack.\n\nThe episode was written by Charlie Brooker, who was inspired by a documentary about the Iraq War which featured a civilian speaking for several minutes uninterrupted, and Dave Grossman's book, \"On Killing\", which is about the psychology of killing and based on Brigadier General S.L.A. Marshall's work. The title of the episode comes from Marshall's book \"Men Against Fire: The Problem of Battle Command\" (1947), wherein Marshall claims that during World War II, over 70% of soldiers did not fire their rifles, even under immediate threat, and most of those who fired aimed above the enemy's head. A similar statement is made during one of Arquette's dialogues in the episode.\n\nSuchandrika Chakrabarti of \"Daily Mirror\" rated the episode 5 out of 5, noting how the episode \"forces you to think about the philosophical consequences of high-tech warfare\". Adam Chitwood of \"Collider\" criticised the episode, saying it \"tips its hand way too early and is heavy-handed with its social commentary\".\n\n"}

This is in contrast to a nation state, where a single nation accounts for the bulk of the population. Depending on the definition of \"nation\" (which touches on ethnicity, language, and political identity), a multinational state might also be multicultural or multilingual.\n\nPresent-day examples of multinational states are Afghanistan, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Canada, China, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Madagascar, Montenegro, Nigeria, Pakistan, Russia, Serbia, South Africa, Spain, Suriname,Turkey, and the United Kingdom. Examples of historical multinational states that have since split into multiple sovereign states include Austria-Hungary, British India, Czechoslovakia, the Empire of Japan, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia. Some analysts have described the European Union as a multinational state or a potential one.\n\nMany attempts have been made to define what a multinational state is. One complicating factor is that it is possible for members of a group that could be considered a nation to identify with two different nationalities simultaneously. As Ilan Peleg wrote in \"Democratizing the Hegemonic State\": \n\nA state may also be a society, and a multiethnic society has people belonging to more than one ethnic group, in contrast to societies that are ethnically homogeneous. By some definitions of \"society\" and \"homogeneous\", virtually all contemporary national societies are multiethnic. The scholar David Welsh argued in 1993 that fewer than 20 of the 180 sovereign states then in existence were ethnically and nationally homogeneous, if a homogeneous state was defined as one in which minorities made up less than 5 percent of the population. Sujit Choudhry therefore argues that \"[t]he age of the ethnoculturally homogeneous state, if ever there was one, is over\".\n\nAccording to Neil MacGregor, Director of the British Museum, the Cyrus Cylinder written by Cyrus the Great, the founder of the Persian Empire, was \"the first attempt we know about running a society, a state with different nationalities and faiths—a new kind of statecraft.\"\n\nThe \"CIA World Factbook\" provides a list of the ethnic makeup of every country in the world.\n\nWhether Canada should be described as \"multinational\" is an ongoing topic in academia and popular discourse. The current policy of the federal government is that Canada is bilingual—English and French are both official languages—and multicultural. In 2006, the House of Commons of Canada voted in favour of \"Government Business No. 11\", which states that the Québécois \"form a nation within a united Canada\".\n\nSince 2010, under the presidency of Evo Morales, Bolivia has been officially defined as a plurinational state, which recognizes the national distinctiveness of various indigenous peoples.\n\nMany Asian countries recognise multiple ethnic groups:\n\nIndia has more than 2,000 ethnic groups and over 80,000 subcultures, and every major religion is represented, as are four major language families (Indo-European, Dravidian, Austroasiatic, and Sino-Tibetan) and a language isolate (Nihali).\n\nEach state and union territory of India has one or more official languages, and the Constitution of India recognizes in particular 22 \"scheduled languages\". It also recognizes 212 scheduled tribal groups, which together constitute about 7.5% of the country's population. \n\nIndia has a Muslim-majority state (Jammu and Kashmir) and a Muslim-majority union territory (Lakshadweep); three Christian-majority states (Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Nagaland); and a Sikh-majority state (Punjab). Most of its states are based on ethnicity, including Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Chhatisgarh (Hindustani), Tamil Nadu (Tamil), Andhra Pradesh and Telangana (Telugu), Karnataka (Kannadigas), Odisha (Odia), Jammu and Kashmir (Dogras and Kashmiris), Goa (Konkanis), Gujarat (Gujarati), West Bengal (Bengali), Maharashtra (Marathi), Punjab (Punjabi), Haryana (Haryanvi), and Kerala (Malayali).\n\nFurthermore, several Indian states are themselves ethnically, religiously, and linguistically diverse. Bihar and Jharkhand are home to the Maithils, Santalis and the Hindustani language speaking people. Karnataka is home to the Tulu and Kannada people; Jammu and Kashmir consists of Hindu-majority Jammu, Muslim-majority Kashmir, and Buddhist-majority Ladakh; and Assam includes the Assamese, Bodo, and Karbi people.\n\nThere are over 300 ethnic groups in Indonesia\n\nNepal does not have a majority ethnic group, and its society is multiethnic, multireligious, and multilingual. Aside from the country's indigenous people, most Nepalese are descendants of migrants from Kashmir, Greater Nepal, Tibet, India, and parts of Myanmar and China's Yunnan Province.\n\nKhas and Mongoloids populate the hilly areas of Nepal, while the Madhesis, a diverse group live in the southern plains. The indigenous Tharu people are also among the early settlers of the Terai region. The Himalayas are sparsely populated above 3,000 m (9,800 ft), but north of the mountains, in central and western Nepal, ethnic Sherpas and Tamangs inhabit high, semi-arid valleys. The Kathmandu Valley, in the middle hill region, constitutes a small fraction of the nation's area but is the most densely populated, with almost 5 percent of the nation's population. \n\nSri Lanka is inhabited by Sinhalese, Sri Lankan Tamils, Indian Tamils, Moors, Veddas, Burghers, and other small ethnic groups.\n\nAfghanistan has no ethnic majority, although the Pashtuns are estimated to account for over 45% of the population. Under the sovereign governance of Pashtun rulers, the term \"Afghan\" was changed from an ethnonym for Pashtuns to a demonym for any citizen of Afghanistan, regardless of ethnic affiliation. This change was incorporated into the constitution, making it resemble that of a multinational state. However, irredentist disputes over Pakistan's Pashtun lands have continued. \n\nOther ethnic groups in Afghanistan include Tajiks, Hazaras, Uzbeks, Aimaqs, Turkmens, and Balochs. The government gives equal status to Pashto and Dari as official languages.\n\nPresent-day Pakistan arose out of the Pakistan Movement, which demanded a separate state for the Muslims of the British Raj. The movement was based on the two-nation theory put forward by Muhammad Ali Jinnah: the idea that Hindus and Muslims in British India represented not only different religious communities but also distinct nations, and hence that, in the event of Indian independence, they should be divided into two nation states. Jinnah (known in Pakistan as \"Quaid-e-Azm\", meaning \"the great leader\") outlined the theory as follows:\n\nThis movement culminated in the creation of Pakistan in 1947 through the partition of India. Urdu was then promoted as the national language of all South Asian Muslims. However, Pakistan remains ethnically diverse. Punjabis are the largest language group, but at 45 percent of the population, they do not make up an absolute majority. Furthermore, only 8 percent of Pakistanis speak the national language, Urdu, as their mother tongue. As a result, many nationalist movements that oppose the two-nation theory have emerged, arguing that Pakistan is not only a linguistically diverse state but also a multinational one, and that, therefore, each ethnolinguistic group of Pakistan is a distinct nation. Common grievances of these movements include the idea that Punjabis dominate Pakistan politically and economically, thus marginalizing other groups, and that the establishment of Urdu as the country's sole official language is a form of cultural imperialism that ignores the heritage of Pakistan's diverse peoples.\n\nThe most successful of these movements was Bengali nationalism, which led to the creation of the Bengali-speaking nation-state of Bangladesh. The movement asserted that Urdu's official status gave an unfair advantage to Muhajirs (most of whom speak Urdu as their mother tongue) and Punjabis (whose mother tongue, Punjabi, is similar to Urdu, and many of whom were educated in Urdu under British rule). Bengalis feared they would be marginalized despite their demographic strength as, at the time, the largest ethnic group of Pakistan. These grievances culminated in the secession of East Bengal (which had been part of the administrative unit of East Pakistan) and the creation of Bangladesh.\n\nToday, nationalist movements within Pakistan include those of the Sindhis, Pashtuns, Balochs, Mohajirs, and Kashmiris. The members of these movements assert that Islam cannot be considered the sole basis for nationhood, and that Pakistan is therefore a multinational state. Their demands range from increased autonomy or the transformation of Pakistan into a federation, to the recognition of language rights for non-Urdu-speaking populations, to outright secession.\n\nDespite the fact that Punjabis are widely seen as the dominant ethnic group in Pakistan, both economically and politically, there is also a small Punjabi movement that asserts that the Punjabi language has been unfairly subordinated to Urdu and supports the reestablishment of cultural and economic links with East Punjab in India.\n\nWhen it was formed on 16 September 1963, Malaysia comprised four independent, self-governing nations: Malaya, Singapore, Sabah, and Sarawak. In 1965, Singapore seceded from the federation. Today, Malaya, Sabah, and Sarawak each have their own ethnic majority. Generally, however, Malaysia is considered to have three major ethnic groups: Malays, Chinese, and Indians. The Iban people are the majority in Sarawak, while Sabah is dominated by the Kadazan-Dusun, Murut, and Bajau peoples. Malay is the primary national language, followed by English. In Sabah and Sarawak, English is the official language, although many locals speak a dialect of Malay.\n\nAlthough the population of China is dominated numerically by the Han Chinese, the government recognizes 56 ethnic groups. Fifty-five of the 56 groups together account for less than 10 percent of the population.\n\nMontenegro is the only European state with no ethnic majority, but many others have ethnic minorities that form a majority within a province or region (see multilingual countries and regions of Europe).\n\nRussia has more than 160 ethnic groups and indigenous peoples. The largest population are the ethnic Russians, who are Slavs with Eastern Orthodox religious traditions, while the Tatars and Bashkirs are predominantly Muslim. Russia is also home to Buddhist populations, such as the nomadic Buryats and Kalmyks; the Shamanistic peoples of Siberia and the Far North; the Finno-Ugric peoples of the Russian Northwest and the Volga region; the Korean inhabitants of Sakhalin; and the peoples of the North Caucasus.\n\nOut of a total of more than 100 languages spoken in Russia, 27 have the status of official languages, the most widely spoken being Russian. More than 3 percent of the population speaks Tatar.\n\nThe territory of Belgium is almost equally divided between the two nations of Flemish Flanders and Francophone Wallonia. This led to political unrest throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, and in the aftermath of the difficult 2007–08 Belgian government formation, the Belgian media envisaged a partition of Belgium as a potential solution. There is also a German-speaking minority in the east.\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina is home to three ethnic \"constituent peoples\": Bosniaks (50.11%), Serbs (30.78%), and Croats (15.43%). The country's political divisions were created by the Dayton Agreement, which recognized a second tier of government comprising two entities: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (mostly Bosniaks and Croats) and the Republika Srpska (mostly Serbs), with each governing roughly half of the state's territory. A third region, the Brčko District, was governed locally. Today, all three ethnic groups have an equal constitutional status over the entire territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The country has a bicameral legislature and a three-member presidency composed of one member of each major ethnic group.\n\nIn order to maintain a nation state, France does not recognize any national identity or language other than French in its territory. However, many of its current and former territories—Alsace, Brittany, Corsica, Flanders, Moselle, Northern Catalonia, Occitania, Savoy, and the Basque Country—were not culturally French until they were francized in the late 19th century. According to WikiLeaks, former Prime Minister Michel Rocard told the American ambassador to France, Craig Roberts Stapleton, in 2005, \"France created itself by destroying five cultures: Breton, Occitan, Alsatian, Corsican, and Flemish.\"\n\nMontenegro is a multiethnic state in which no ethnic group forms a majority. The preamble of the Constitution of Montenegro identifies numerous nationalities—Montenegrins, Serbs, Bosniaks, Albanians, Muslims, Croats, and others—as citizens of a civic and democratic state. The largest ethnic groups are Montenegrins (45%), Serbs (28.7%), Bosniaks (8.6%), Albanians (4.9%), and Muslims (3.3%). \n\nThe official language is Montenegrin, but Serbian, Bosnian, Albanian, and Croatian are also in official use. In the 2011 census, Serbian was the most common mother tongue (42.88%), Montenegrin the second (36.97%), and Bosnian the third (5.33%).\n\nOfficial policy states that Norway was founded on the territory of two peoples, Norwegians and Samis. In addition, Forest Finns, Kvens, Jews, Romani, and the Norwegian and Swedish Travellers are recognised as national minorities.\n\nNineteen ethnic groups are officially recognised as national minorities in Serbia. Serbs are the largest ethnic group in the country, constituting 83.3 percent of the population (excluding Kosovo). The largest national minorities are Hungarians, Roma, and Bosniaks, and there are also significant populations of Croats, Montenegrins, Albanians, Slovaks, Romanians, Vlachs, Rusyns, Gorani, Macedonians, and Bulgarians. Since 2002, minorities have been entitled to organize their own national councils. Through those councils, members of national minorities can exercise their rights in the spheres of culture, education, information, and the official use of their own languages and scripts.\n\nVojvodina is a multiethnic autonomous province in northern Serbia, with more than 26 ethnic groups and six official languages.\n\nDefinitions of ethnicity and nationality in Spain are politically fraught, particularly since the transition from Francoist Spain to the Kingdom of Spain in the 1970s, when local regionalisms and peripheral nationalisms became a major part of national politics. \n\nThe term Spanish people (Spanish: \"pueblo español\") is defined in the Spanish Constitution of 1978 as the political sovereign, i.e., the citizens of the Kingdom of Spain. The same constitution, in its preamble, speaks of \"peoples and nationalities of Spain\" (\"pueblos y nacionalidades de España\") and their respective cultures, traditions, languages, and institutions.\n\nThe \"CIA World Factbook\" (2011) describes Spain's ethnic makeup as a \"composite of Mediterranean and Nordic types\", instead of the usual breakdown of ethnic composition. This reflects the formation of the modern Kingdom of Spain by the accretion of numerous independent Iberian realms: Andalusia, Aragon, Asturias, Castile, Catalonia, Galicia, León, Majorca, Navarre, and Valencia. Thus, today's Spaniards include Andalusians, Aragonese, Asturians, Basques, Cantabrians, Castilians, Catalans, Galicians, Leonese, and Valencians, and individual members of these groups may or may not consider them distinct nations.\n\nWhile the Office for National Statistics describes the United Kingdom as a nation state, other people, including former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, describe it as a multinational state. The term \"Home Nations\" is used to describe the national teams that represent the four nations of the United Kingdom: England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales.\n\nThe Kingdom of Great Britain was created on 1 May 1707 by the political union of the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland. This unification was the result of the Treaty of Union, which was agreed to on 22 July 1706 and then ratified by the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland in the 1707 Acts of Union. The two kingdoms, along with the Kingdom of Ireland, had already been in a personal union as a result of the 1603 Union of the Crowns, in which James VI, King of Scots, inherited the Kingdoms of England and Ireland and moved his court from Edinburgh to London. However, until 1707, all three had remained separate political entities with separate political institutions.\n\nPrior to the Acts of Union, the Kingdoms of England and Scotland both had minority populations of their own that could themselves be called nations. Wales and Cornwall were part of the Kingdom of England (Wales had been officially incorporated into England by the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542, although it had been a \"de facto\" English territory since the 13th century; Cornwall had been conquered during the Anglo-Saxon period). The Northern Isles, with their Norse-derived culture, were part of Scotland, having been pledged by Norway as security against the payment of a dowry for Margaret of Denmark and then integrated in 1471. When the Kingdom of Great Britain was created, many of its inhabitants retained a sense of English, Scottish, or Welsh identity. Many of them also spoke languages other than English: principally Scottish Gaelic, Scots, Welsh, Cornish, and Norn.\n\nAlmost a century later, the Kingdom of Ireland merged with the Kingdom of Great Britain to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland under the 1800 Acts of Union. The United Kingdom thus became the union of the kingdoms of England, Ireland, and Scotland. Eventually, disputes within Ireland over the terms of Irish home rule led to the partition of the island: The Irish Free State received dominion status in 1922, while Northern Ireland remained part of the UK. As a result, in 1927, the formal title of the UK was changed to its current form, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\nPolitical, ethnic, and religious tensions between Irish and British groups in Northern Ireland culminated in The Troubles. This period of armed conflict erupted in 1966 between loyalist paramilitaries, seeking to maintain the country's position in the UK, and republican paramilitaries, seeking to unify Ireland as a 32-county independent republic. The British Army also played a key role. Following the deaths of over 3,500 people, a peace treaty was reached in 1998, although divisions remain high in some areas and sporadic violence still occurs.\n\nThe end of the 20th century brought major governing changes, with the establishment of devolved national administrations for Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales following pre-legislative referendums.\n\nThe Scottish National Party, the current party of government in Scotland, is committed to the goal of an independent Scotland within the European Union, but this is opposed by the leadership of the next three largest parties in the Scottish Parliament. A referendum on Scottish independence was held in September 2014, and the electorate rejected it. Plaid Cymru, a Welsh party, has a similar ambition for Wales. Several parties in Northern Ireland, including the second- and third-largest, seek to establish an independent United Ireland, and have repeatedly called for border polls. The d'Hondt system used here means that either the First Minister or Deputy First Minister will be from one of these parties.\n\nMost countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are former colonies and, as such, are not drawn along national lines, making them truly multinational states. \nDuring its colonial time Ghana was imperialized by many countries and empires including the British Empire, the Portuguese Empire, the Danish Empire and the German Empire. Ghana has also seen a large mass of Chinese, Malay, European, Lebanese, and other multinational immigrants.\nKenya is home to more than 70 ethnic groups, the most populous of which are the Kikuyu, at about 20 percent of the population. Together, the five largest groups—the Kikuyu, Luo, Luhya, Kamba, and Kalenjin—account for 70 percent of Kenyans.\n\nThe largest nation in Nigeria is the Hausa-Fulani, which accounts for 29 percent of the country's population. However, the group actually encompasses two distinct ethnicities: the Hausa and the Fulani (or Fulbe). While both ethnicities are found in large areas of West Africa, it is only in Nigeria that they are classified as a single ethnic group for political expediency. \n\nPresent-day South Africa is the successor state to the Union of South Africa, which was formed from four British colonies in 1910. \n\nSouth Africa has eleven official languages (Afrikaans, English, Ndebele, Pedi, Sotho, Swazi, Tsonga, Tswana, Venda, Xhosa, and Zulu) and formally recognises several other languages spoken by minority nations. Speakers of each language may be of a different nationality—for example, some members of the Ndebele and Tswana nations speak Zulu, and groups such as the Thembu and Hlubi speak Xhosa. \n\nAs is the case throughout Africa, the nations of South Africa mostly correspond to specific regions. However, large cities such as Johannesburg are home to a mixture of national groups, leading to a \"melting pot\" of cultures. The government has continuously attempted to unify the country's various nationalities and to foster a South African identity. \n\nMany of the nationalities found in South Africa are also found in bordering countries, and in some cases, more members live in South Africa than in the country where the group originated. For example, there are more Sotho, Tswana, and Swazi people living in South Africa than in the bordering nation states of Lesotho, Botswana, and Swaziland, respectively. In the past, this has led to conflict. Lesotho still claims large swathes of South Africa, and attempts have been made to cede some South African territory to Botswana and Swaziland. All three states were intended to be incorporated in the Union of South Africa, but those plans never came to fruition because of power struggles within their apartheid governments.\n\nAustria-Hungary, which succeeded the Austrian Empire, was a historical multinational state. The centrifugal forces within it, coupled with its loss in World War I, led to its breakup in 1918. Its successor states included the First Austrian Republic, the Kingdom of Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, which later became part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Parts of Austria-Hungary were also incorporated into Poland, Ukraine, the Kingdom of Romania, and the Kingdom of Italy.\n\nThe principal languages of Austria-Hungary were German, Hungarian, Polish, Czech, and Croatian, but there were also many minor languages, including Ukrainian, Romanian, Slovak, Serbian, Slovene, Rusyn, Italian, and Yiddish.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire was the dynastic state of the Turkish House of Osman. At its peak in the 16th and 17th centuries, it controlled much of Southeast Europe, Western Asia, the Caucasus, North Africa, and the Horn of Africa. \n\nIn addition to Turks, the ethnic groups of the Ottoman Empire included Albanians, Amazighs, Arabs, Armenians, Assyrians, Bosnians, Bulgarians, Circassians, Georgians, Greeks, Jews, Kurds, Laz, Macedonians, Romanians, Serbs, Tatars, and Zazas.\n\nThrough millet courts, confessional communities were allowed to rule themselves under their own legal systems: for example, sharia law for Muslims, Canon law for Christians, and halakha law for Jews. After the Tanzimat reforms from 1839–76, the term \"millet\" was used to refer to legally protected religious minority groups, similar to the way other countries use the word \"nation\". (The word \"millet\" comes from the Arabic word \"millah\" (ملة), which literally means \"nation\".) The millet system has been called an example of pre-modern religious pluralism.\n\nThe Soviet Union was a state composed of the Soviet republics (of which there were 15 after 1956), with the capital in Moscow. It was founded in December 1922, when the Russian SFSR—which formed during the Russian Revolution of 1917 and emerged victorious in the ensuing Russian Civil War—unified with the Transcaucasian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian SSRs. Addressing the Extraordinary Eighth Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union on 25 November 1936, Joseph Stalin stated that \"within the Soviet Union there are about sixty nations, national groups, and nationalities. The Soviet state is a multinational state.\"\n\nIn the late 1980s, some of the republics sought sovereignty over their territories, citing Article 72 of the USSR Constitution, which stated that any constituent republic was free to secede. On 7 April 1990, a law was passed allowing a republic to secede if more than two-thirds of its residents voted for secession in a referendum. Many held free elections, and the resulting legislatures soon passed bills that contradicted Soviet laws, in what became known as the War of Laws.\n\nIn 1989, the Russian SFSR—the largest constituent republic, with about half of the USSR's population—convened a new Congress of People's Deputies and elected Boris Yeltsin its chairman. On 12 June 1990, the Congress declared Russia's sovereignty over its territory and proceeded to pass legislation that attempted to supersede Soviet laws. Legal uncertainty continued through 1991 as constituent republics slowly gained \"de facto\" independence.\n\nIn a referendum on 17 March 1991, majorities in nine of the 15 republics voted to preserve the Union. The referendum gave Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev a minor boost, and in the summer of 1991, the New Union Treaty was designed and agreed upon by eight republics. The treaty would have turned the Soviet Union into a much looser federation, but its signing was interrupted by the August Coup—an attempted coup d'état against Gorbachev by hardline Communist Party members of the government and the KGB, who sought to reverse Gorbachev's reforms and reassert the central government's control over the republics. When the coup collapsed, Yeltsin—who had publicly opposed it—came out as a hero, while Gorbachev's power was effectively ended. \n\nAs a result, the balance of power tipped significantly toward the republics. In August 1991, Latvia and Estonia declared their independence (following Lithuania's 1990 example), while the other twelve republics continued to discuss new, increasingly loose models for the Union.\n\nOn 8 December 1991, the presidents of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus signed the Belavezha Accords, which declared the Soviet Union dissolved and established the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in its place. Doubts remained about the authority of the Belavezha Accords to dissolve the Union, but on 21 December 1991, representatives of every Soviet republic except Georgia—including those that had signed the Belavezha Accords—signed the Alma-Ata Protocol, which confirmed the dissolution of the USSR and reiterated the establishment of the CIS. On 25 December 1991, Gorbachev yielded, resigning as the president of the USSR and declaring the office extinct. He turned the powers vested in the Soviet presidency over to Yeltsin, the president of Russia.\n\nThe following day, the Supreme Soviet, the highest governmental body of the Soviet Union, dissolved itself. Many organizations, such as the Soviet Army and police forces, remained in place in the early months of 1992, but were slowly phased out and either withdrawn from or absorbed by the newly independent states.\n\nThe first country to be known by this name was the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, known until 3 October 1929 as the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. It was established on 1 December 1918 by the union of the State of Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs and the Kingdom of Serbia (to which the Kingdom of Montenegro had been annexed on 13 November 1918), and the Conference of Ambassadors gave international recognition to the union on 13 July 1922. \n\nThe Kingdom of Yugoslavia was invaded by the Axis powers in 1941 and abolished as a result of World War II. It was succeeded by Democratic Federal Yugoslavia, proclaimed in 1943 by the Yugoslav Partisans resistance movement. When a communist government was established in 1946, the country was renamed the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. In 1963, it was renamed again, becoming the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY). This was the largest Yugoslav state, with Istria and Rijeka having been added after World War II.\n\nThe country consisted of six constituent \"socialist republics\" (SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, SR Croatia, SR Macedonia, SR Montenegro, SR Slovenia, and SR Serbia) and two \"socialist autonomous provinces\" (SAP Vojvodina and SAP Kosovo, which became largely equal to other members of the federation after 1974).\n\nStarting in 1991, the SFRY disintegrated in the Yugoslav Wars, which followed the secession of most of the country's constituent entities. The next Yugoslavia, known as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, existed until 2003, when it was renamed Serbia and Montenegro. In 2006, this last vestige separated into Serbia and Montenegro, but only to go further in 2008 after Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence.\n\n"}

{"id": "22986", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22986", "title": "Politics", "text": "Politics\n\nPolitics (from , meaning \"affairs of the cities\") is the process of making decisions that apply to members of a group.\n\nIt refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance—organized control over a human community, particularly a state. The academic study focusing on just politics, which is therefore more targeted than all Political science, is sometimes referred to as Politology (not to be confused with Politicology).\n\nIn modern nation-states, people have formed political parties to represent their ideas. They agree to take the same position on many issues and agree to support the same changes to law and the same leaders.\n\nAn election is usually a competition between different parties. Some examples of political parties worldwide are: the African National Congress (ANC) in South Africa, the Conservatives in the United Kingdom, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in Germany and the Indian National Congress in India.\n\nPolitics is a multifaceted word. It has a set of fairly specific meanings that are descriptive and nonjudgmental (such as \"the art or science of government\" and \"political principles\"), but often does carry a connotation of dishonest malpractice. The word has been used negatively for many years: the British national anthem as published in 1745 calls on God to \"Confound their politics\", and the phrase \"play politics\", for example, has been in use since at least 1853, when abolitionist Wendell Phillips declared: \"We do not play politics; anti-slavery is no half-jest with us.\"\n\nA variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.\n\nIt is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. The history of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's \"Republic\", Aristotle's \"Politics\" and the works of Confucius.\n\nThe word comes from the same Greek word from which the title of Aristotle's book \"Politics\" (Πολιτικά, \"Polis\") also derives; \"polis\" means \"affairs of the cities\". The book title was rendered in Early Modern English in the mid-15th century as \"Polettiques\"; it became \"politics\" in Modern English. The singular \"politic\" first attested in English 1430 and comes from Middle French \"politique\", in turn from Latin \"politicus\", which is the Latinization of the Greek πολιτικός (\"politikos\"), meaning amongst others \"of, for, or relating to citizens\", \"civil\", \"civic\", \"belonging to the state\", in turn from πολίτης (\"polites\"), \"citizen\" and that from πόλις (\"polis\"), \"city\".\n\nFormal politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures. Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.\n\nSemi-formal politics is politics in government associations such as neighborhood associations, or student governments where student government political party politics is often important.\n\nInformal politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another. Informal Politics is typically understood as everyday politics, hence the idea that \"politics is everywhere\".\n\nThe history of politics is reflected in the origin, development, and economics of the institutions of government.\n\nThe origin of the state is to be found in the development of the \"art of warfare\". Historically speaking, all political communities of the modern type owe their existence to successful warfare.\n\nKings, emperors and other types of monarchs in many countries including China and Japan, were considered divine. Of the institutions that ruled states, that of kingship stood at the forefront until the American Revolution put an end to the \"divine right of kings\". Nevertheless, the monarchy is among the longest-lasting political institutions, dating as early as 2100 BC in Sumeria to the 21st century AD British Monarchy. Kingship becomes an institution through the institution of hereditary monarchy.\n\nThe king often, even in absolute monarchies, ruled his kingdom with the aid of an elite group of advisors, a council without which he could not maintain power. As these advisors and others outside the monarchy negotiated for power, constitutional monarchies emerged, which may be considered the germ of constitutional government.\n\nThe greatest of the king's subordinates, the earls and dukes in England and Scotland, the dukes and counts in the Continent, always sat as a right on the council. A conqueror wages war upon the vanquished for vengeance or for plunder but an established kingdom exacts tribute. One of the functions of the council is to keep the coffers of the king full. Another is the satisfaction of military service and the establishment of lordships by the king to satisfy the task of collecting taxes and soldiers.\n\nThere are many forms of political organization, including states, non-government organizations (NGOs) and international organizations such as the United Nations. States are perhaps the predominant institutional form of political governance, where a state is understood as an institution and a government is understood as the regime in power.\n\nAccording to Aristotle, states are classified into monarchies, aristocracies, timocracies, democracies, oligarchies, and tyrannies. Due to changes across the history of politics, this classification has been abandoned.\n\nAll states are varieties of a single organizational form, the sovereign state. All the great powers of the modern world rule on the principle of sovereignty. Sovereign power may be vested on an individual as in an autocratic government or it may be vested on a group as in a constitutional government. Constitutions are written documents that specify and limit the powers of the different branches of government. Although a constitution is a written document, there is also an unwritten constitution. The unwritten constitution is continually being written by the legislative branch of government; this is just one of those cases in which the nature of the circumstances determines the form of government that is most appropriate. England did set the fashion of written constitutions during the Civil War but after the Restoration abandoned them to be taken up later by the American Colonies after their emancipation and then France after the Revolution and the rest of Europe including the European colonies.\n\nThere are many forms of government. One form is a strong central government as in France and China. Another form is local government, such as the ancient divisions in England that are comparatively weaker but less bureaucratic. These two forms helped to shape the practice of federal government, first in Switzerland, then in the United States in 1776, in Canada in 1867 and in Germany in 1871 and in 1901, Australia. Federal states introduced the new principle of agreement or contract. Compared to a federation, a confederation has a more dispersed system of judicial power. In the American Civil War, the argument by the Confederate States that a State could secede from the Union didn't stand because of the Federal government's power.\n\nAccording to professor A. V. Dicey in \"An Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution\", the essential features of a federal constitution are: a) A written supreme constitution in order to prevent disputes between the jurisdictions of the Federal and State authorities; b) A distribution of power between the Federal and State governments and c) A Supreme Court vested with the power to interpret the Constitution and enforce the law of the land remaining independent of both the executive and legislative branches.\n\nGlobal politics include different practices of political globalization in relation to questions of social power: from global patterns of governance to issues of globalizing conflict. The 20th century witnessed the outcome of two world wars and not only the rise and fall of the Third Reich but also the rise and relative fall of communism. The development of the atomic bomb gave the United States a more rapid end to its conflict in Japan in World War II. Later, the hydrogen bomb became the ultimate weapon of mass destruction.\n\nGlobal politics also concerns the rise of global and international organizations. The United Nations has served as a forum for peace in a world threatened by nuclear war, \"The invention of nuclear and space weapons has made war unacceptable as an instrument for achieving political ends.\" Although an all-out final nuclear holocaust is radically undesirable for man, \"nuclear blackmail\" comes into question not only on the issue of world peace but also on the issue of national sovereignty. On a Sunday in 1962, the world stood still at the brink of nuclear war during the October Cuban Missile Crisis from the implementation of U.S. vs Soviet Union nuclear blackmail policy.\n\nAccording to political science professor Paul James, global politics is affected by \"values\": norms of human rights, ideas of human development, and beliefs such as cosmopolitanism about how we should relate to each:\n\nWilliam Pitt the Elder, speaking before the British House of Lords, 9 January 1770, observed: \"Unlimited power is apt to corrupt the minds of those who possess it.\" This was echoed more famously by John Dalberg-Acton over a century later: \"Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\"\n\nPolitical corruption is the use of legislated powers by government officials for illegitimate private gain. Misuse of government power for other purposes, such as repression of political opponents and general police brutality, is not considered political corruption. Neither are illegal acts by private persons or corporations not directly involved with the government. An illegal act by an officeholder constitutes political corruption only if the act is directly related to their official duties and/or power.\n\nForms of corruption vary, but include corruption, extortion, cronyism, nepotism, patronage, graft, and embezzlement. While corruption may facilitate criminal enterprise such as drug trafficking, money laundering, and trafficking, it is not restricted to these activities. The activities that constitute illegal corruption differ depending on the country or jurisdiction. For instance, certain political funding practices that are legal in one place may be illegal in another. In some cases, government officials have broad or poorly defined powers, which make it difficult to distinguish between legal and illegal actions. Worldwide, bribery alone is estimated to involve over 1 trillion US dollars annually. A state of unrestrained political corruption is known as a kleptocracy, literally meaning \"rule by thieves\".\n\nA political party is a political organization that typically seeks to attain and maintain political power within government, usually by participating in electoral campaigns, educational outreach or protest actions. Parties often espouse an expressed ideology or vision bolstered by a written platform with specific goals, forming a coalition among disparate interests.\n\nPolitical science, the study of politics, examines the acquisition and application of power. Political scientist Harold Lasswell defined politics as \"who gets what, when, and how\". Related areas of study include political philosophy, which seeks a rationale for politics and an ethic of public behaviour, as well as examining the preconditions for the formation of political communities; political economy, which attempts to develop understandings of the relationships between politics and the economy and the governance of the two; and public administration, which examines the practices of governance. The philosopher Charles Blattberg, who has defined politics as \"responding to conflict with dialogue,\" offers an account which distinguishes political philosophies from political ideologies.\n\nThe first academic chair devoted to politics in the United States was the chair of history and political science at Columbia University, first occupied by Prussian émigré Francis Lieber in 1857.\n\nSeveral different political spectra have been proposed.\n\nPolitical analysts and politicians divide politics into left wing and right wing politics, often also using the idea of center politics as a middle path of policy between the right and left. This classification is comparatively recent (it was not used by Aristotle or Hobbes, for instance), and dates from the French Revolution era, when those members of the National Assembly who supported the republic, the common people and a secular society sat on the left and supporters of the monarchy, aristocratic privilege and the Church sat on the right.\n\nThe meanings behind the labels have become more complicated over the years. A particularly influential event was the publication of the Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in 1848. The \"Manifesto\" suggested a course of action for a proletarian revolution to overthrow the bourgeois society and abolish private property, in the belief that this would lead to a classless and stateless society.\n\nThe meaning of left-wing and right-wing varies considerably between different countries and at different times, but generally speaking, it can be said that the right wing often values tradition and inequality while the left wing often values progress and egalitarianism, with the center seeking a balance between the two such as with social democracy, libertarianism or regulated capitalism.\n\nAccording to Norberto Bobbio, one of the major exponents of this distinction, the Left believes in attempting to eradicate social inequality – believing it to be unethical or unnatural while the Right regards most social inequality as the result of ineradicable natural inequalities, and sees attempts to enforce social equality as utopian or authoritarian.\nSome ideologies, notably Christian Democracy, claim to combine left and right wing politics; according to Geoffrey K. Roberts and Patricia Hogwood, \"In terms of ideology, Christian Democracy has incorporated many of the views held by liberals, conservatives and socialists within a wider framework of moral and Christian principles.\" Movements which claim or formerly claimed to be above the left-right divide include Fascist Terza Posizione economic politics in Italy, Peronism in Argentina, and National Action Party in Mexico.\nAuthoritarianism and libertarianism refer to the amount of individual freedom each person possesses in that society relative to the state. One author describes authoritarian political systems as those where \"individual rights and goals are subjugated to group goals, expectations and conformities\", while libertarians generally oppose the state and hold the individual as sovereign. In their purest form, libertarians are anarchists , who argue for the total abolition of the state, of political parties and of other political entities, while the purest authoritarians are, by definition, totalitarians who support state control over all aspects of society. \n\nFor instance, classical liberalism (also known as \"laissez-faire liberalism\",) is a doctrine stressing individual freedom and limited government. This includes the importance of human rationality, individual property rights, free markets, natural rights, the protection of civil liberties, constitutional limitation of government, and individual freedom from restraint as exemplified in the writings of John Locke, Adam Smith, David Hume, David Ricardo, Voltaire, Montesquieu and others. According to the libertarian Institute for Humane Studies, \"the libertarian, or 'classical liberal,' perspective is that individual well-being, prosperity, and social harmony are fostered by 'as much liberty as possible' and 'as little government as necessary.'\" For anarchist political philosopher L. Susan Brown \"Liberalism and anarchism are two political philosophies that are fundamentally concerned with individual freedom yet differ from one another in very distinct ways. Anarchism shares with liberalism a radical commitment to individual freedom while rejecting liberalism's competitive property relations.\"\n\n\n"}

From 7 March 2011, the programme was repeated in the early mornings, on BBC2. The second series, comprising a further 26 episodes, started on 11 July 2011. The third series, comprising the final 26 episodes, began on CBeebies 23 March 2015.\n\nThe series features an all-mouse reggae band, Rastamouse and Da Easy Crew, who play music at the 'Nuff Song Studio' when they're not solving mysteries for the President of Mouseland. All the characters speak with a Jamaican accent.\n\n\n\nRastamouse first appeared in 2004 in the children's books \"Rastamouse and the Crucial Plan\" and \"Rastamouse Da Bag-a Bling\". A third book, \"Rastamouse and the Double-Crossin' Diva\", was published in 2005. The stories were co-written by Genevieve Webster, an author and illustrator, and Michael De Souza, a Rastafarian swimming instructor. They are written in rhyme and contain a Caribbean accent and some Jamaican Patois terms. A pop song, \"Ice Popp\", was released in 2011.\n\nLenny Henry read two of the stories, \"The Crucial Plan\" and \"Da Bag-a Bling\", for the BBC's \"Jackanory Junior\", which was first shown in January 2008.\n\nThe stories emphasise the importance of solving problems through mutual understanding, love and respect, without resorting to punishment. \"Rastamouse\"s ethos is redemption and not retribution — \"make a bad ting good\" — helping wrong-doers to redeem themselves from their mistakes.\n\nRastamouse and Da Easy Crew's album \"Makin' A Bad Ting Good\" was released by EMI in July 2011. It includes the single \"Ice Popp\".\n\nA full second album of original music, \"Best Friends\", was released by the Demon Music Group sublabel Little Demon on 24 June 2016. The lead single of the album was \"Mi Love Mi Music\".\n\nAll music for the series was composed by Andrew Kingslow. The theme tune was sung by Martin \"Sugar\" Merchant, former singer in the rock/reggae band Audioweb.\n\nThe puppets were made by Mackinnon and Saunders, who previously made the puppets for \"Bob the Builder\", \"Postman Pat\" and Tim Burton's \"Corpse Bride\".\n\nThere was early speculation in the British media that the \"Rastamouse\" cheese was an allusion to marijuana, despite actual cheese being shown in the series. The Rastafarian poet Benjamin Zephaniah criticised the accuracy of the West Indian accents. There have been complaints to the BBC regarding the use of Jamaican slang, and racist overtones have been alleged.\n\n\"The Voice\", a newspaper that serves the British African-Caribbean community, welcomed the show, albeit as a stereotype of Jamaican life: a \"The Voice\" website poll showed that over 60% considered it to be a positive programme. \"The Sun\" newspaper reported that the creator, Michael de Souza, had been saddened by the initial media reaction to \"Rastamouse\". Both the \"Sun\" and Digital Spy commented that the BBC claimed that \"Rastamouse is not racist\". \"The Guardian\" newspaper gave a differing view of Rastamouse, with the producer Greg Boardman stating that the producers \"never intentionally put in innuendo or anything that isn't age-appropriate\".\n\nFigures provided by broadcast regulator Ofcom indicate that the animated TV show received 12 complaints in 2011, though none of them was upheld. The BBC described \"Rastamouse\", aimed at children under six, as one of its most popular shows of 2011.\n\nIn June 2011, Rastamouse performed a series of shows in the Kidz Field at Glastonbury Festival.\n\nThey also performed in 2011 on English breakfast show \"Daybreak\".\n\nOn 13 March 2015, Rastamouse & Da Easy Crew took part in Dermot's Day of Dance for Red Nose Day 2015.\n\nOn 28 February 2015, the world's first official \"Rastamouse\" shop was opened by co-author Michael de Souza, in Peckham, South London.\n\n"}
{"id": "990062", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=990062", "title": "Robert Caldwell", "text": "Robert Caldwell\n\nBishop Robert Caldwell (7 May 1814 – 28 August 1891) was a missionary and linguist, who academically established the Dravidian family of languages.He served as Assistant Bishop of Tirunelveli from 1877. He was described in \"The Hindu\" as a \"pioneering champion of the downtrodden\" and an \"avant-garde social reformer\". The Government of Tamil Nadu has created a memorial in his honor and a postage stamp has been issued in his name. a statue of Caldwell was erected in 1967 near to Marina Beach, Chennai, as a gift of the Church of South India.\n\nRobert Caldwell was born at Clady, then in County Antrim, Ireland, on 7 May 1814 to poor Scottish Presbyterian parents. The family moved to Glasgow and there he began work at the age of nine. Mostly self-taught, he returned to Ireland aged 15, living with an older brother in Dublin while studying art between 1829 and 1833. He then returned to Glasgow, probably as a consequence of a crisis of faith, and he became active in the Congregational church.\n\nCaldwell won a scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford only to find it rescinded when the authorities discovered that he had been born in Ireland. He responded by joining the London Missionary Society, who sent him to the University of Glasgow for training. There Caldwell came under the influence of Daniel Keyte Sandford, a professor of Greek and promoter of Anglicanism whose innovative research encouraged Caldwell's liking for comparative philology and also theology. Caldwell left university with a distinction and was ordained as a Congregationalist minister.\n\nAt 24, Caldwell arrived in Madras on 8 January 1838 as a missionary of the London Missionary Society and later joined the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel Mission (SPG). To further his missionary objectives, Caldwell realised that he had to be proficient in Tamil to proselytise the masses and he began a systematic study of the language. He was consecrated Bishop of Tirunelveli in 1877. In 1844, Caldwell married Eliza Mault (1822–99), with whom he had seven children. She was the younger daughter of the veteran Travancore missionary, Reverend Charles Mault (1791–1858) of the London Missionary Society. For more than forty years, Eliza worked in (Idayankudi) and Tirunelveli proselytising the people, especially Tamil-speaking women.\n\nRobert Caldwell used the term \"Dravidian\" to separate the languages spoken in South India from other, more Sanskrit-affiliated languages of India. Apart from the main South Indian languages of Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Tulu, the Brahui language spoken in Pakistan and Afghanistan also belongs to the Dravidian language family. A few more languages have been identified as such. Scholars in the 19th century prior to Caldwell considered Tamil and other South Indian languages to be rooted in Sanskrit and affiliated to the Indo-European language family. Some early critics such as Charles E. Gover, author of \"The Folk Songs of South India\" disagreed with his findings.\n\nWhile Caldwell's \"A Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian or South-Indian family of languages\" was prescient in recognising that Dravidian languages constitute a distinct language family, \"Caldwell's primary concern was to convert the south Indians to Christianity\" and at times the work deliberately ventures beyond the scope of linguistics to advance that goal.\n\nThe Caste system in India was an exploitative, violent and dehumanising ideology that served the interests of high-caste Hindus. In keeping with his Christian beliefs, Caldwell was absolutely opposed to it and committed to the welfare of people whom he believed could be liberated from casteist oppression through evangelism. His efforts to evangelise were directed specifically towards members of the Tamil-speaking Chanar caste, who self-identified as Hindu. Caldwell took the conclusions he had arrived at with respect to the Dravidian language family's distinctive features in a radically new direction by claiming that Tamils, particularly those from the lower-castes like the Chanars, constituted a community distinct from \"other Hindus\".\n\nCaldwell asserted that the Chanar were not merely Tamil speakers but an \"indigenous Dravidian\" people, distinct ethnically and, most critically for him, religiously, from their high-caste oppressors, whom he referred to as \"Brahmanical Aryans\" (another invention of Caldwell's - in this case \"Aryan\" as an ethnic signifier for foreign and \"Brahmanical\" to signify the \"Hinduism\" of the high-caste). These wildly speculative claims, well outside the scope of linguistics, were intended \"to develop a history which asserted that the indigenous Dravidians had been subdued and colonised by the Brahmanical Aryans\". However, the first edition of Caldwell's grammar was \"met with firm resistance\" by the Chanars precisely because they \"did not like the idea of being divorced from Brahmanical civilisation\", the very division Caldwell was hoping to exploit. As a result, Caldwell portrayed Chanar culture as \"superior\" but nonetheless \"distinct\" to Hindu culture in subsequent editions to further his objective of alienating them from high-caste Hindus and converting them to Christianity.\n\nThe book has been described as being on occasion \"pejorative, outrageous, and somewhat paternalistic. But on the whole his studies represent a pioneering effort to understand religions completely foreign to the British mind\". In the domain of Dravidian linguistics though, it remains a respected work today.\n\nWhile serving as Bishop of Tirunelveli (alongside Edward Sargent), Caldwell (who was not a trained archaeologist) did much original research on the history of Tirunelveli. He studied palm leaf manuscripts and Sangam literature in his search, and made several excavations, finding the foundations of ancient buildings, sepulchral urns and coins with the fish emblem of the Pandyan Kingdom. This work resulted in his book \"A Political and General History of the District of Tinnevely\" (1881), published by the Government of the Madras Presidency.\nCaldwell’s mission lasted more than fifty years. The publication of his research into both the languages and the history of the region, coupled with his position in both Indian and English society, gave stimulus to the revival of the Non-Brahmin movement.\n\nMeanwhile, on difficult ground for evangelism, Caldwell achieved Christian conversion among the lower castes. He had adopted some of the methods of the Lutheran missionaries of earlier times, having learned German purely in order to study their practices.\n\nCaldwell the Tamil language scholar, Christian evangelist and champion of the native church, remains today an important figure in the modern history of South India. He is still remembered there, and his statue, erected eighty years after his death, stands near the Marina Beach at Chennai. The Indian historian Dr M.S.S. Pandian, Visiting Fellow at the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies in Delhi, recently commented that Caldwell’s \"contribution to both Christianity in South India and the cultural awakening of the region is unmatched during the last two hundred years\".\n\nA commemorative postage stamp on him was issued on 7 May 2010.\n\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n"}

{"id": "63892", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63892", "title": "Scots language", "text": "Scots language\n\nScots is the Germanic language variety spoken in Lowland Scotland and parts of Ulster (where the local dialect is known as Ulster Scots). It is sometimes called Lowland Scots to distinguish it from Scottish Gaelic, the Celtic language which was historically restricted to most of the Highlands, the Hebrides and Galloway after the 16th century. The Scots language developed during the Middle English period as a distinct entity.\n\nAs there are no universally accepted criteria for distinguishing a language from a dialect, scholars and other interested parties often disagree about the linguistic, historical and social status of Scots and particularly its relationship to English. Although a number of paradigms for distinguishing between languages and dialects exist, they often render contradictory results. Broad Scots is at one end of a bipolar linguistic continuum, with Scottish Standard English at the other. Scots is often regarded as one of the ancient varieties of English, but it has its own distinct dialects. Alternatively, Scots is sometimes treated as a distinct Germanic language, in the way that Norwegian is closely linked to, but distinct from, Danish.\n\nA 2010 Scottish Government study of \"public attitudes towards the Scots language\" found that 64% of respondents (around 1,000 individuals being a representative sample of Scotland's adult population) \"don't really think of Scots as a language\" but it also found that \"the most frequent speakers are least likely to agree that it is not a language (58%) and those never speaking Scots most likely to do so (72%)\". In the 2011 Scottish census, a question on Scots language ability was featured.\n\nNative speakers sometimes refer to their vernacular as \"braid Scots\" (or \"broad Scots\" in English) or use a dialect name such as the \"Doric\", or the \"Buchan Claik\". The old-fashioned \"Scotch\", an English loan, occurs occasionally, especially in Northern Ireland. The term \"Lallans\", a variant of the Modern Scots word \"lawlands\" , is also used, though this is more often taken to mean the Lallans literary form. Scots in Ireland is known in official circles as Ulster-Scots (\"Ulstèr-Scotch\" in revivalist Ulster-Scots) or \"Ullans\", a recent neologism merging Ulster and Lallans.\n\n\"Scots\" is a contraction of \"Scottis\", the Older Scots and northern version of late Old English \"Scottisc\" (modern English \"Scottish\"), which replaced the earlier i-mutated version \"Scyttisc\". Before the end of the fifteenth century, English speech in Scotland was known as \"English\" (written \"Ynglis\" or \"Inglis\" at the time), whereas \"Scottish\" (\"Scottis\") referred to Gaelic.\n\nBy the beginning of the fifteenth century, the English language used in Scotland had arguably become a distinct language, albeit one lacking a name which clearly distinguished it from all the other English variants and dialects spoken in Britain. From 1495 the term \"Scottis\" was increasingly used to refer to the Lowland vernacular and \"Erse\", meaning Irish, as a name for Gaelic. For example, towards the end of the fifteenth century, William Dunbar was using \"Erse\" to refer to Gaelic and, in the early sixteenth century, Gavin Douglas was using \"Scottis\" as a name for the Lowland vernacular. The Gaelic of Scotland is now usually called Scottish Gaelic.\n\nNorthumbrian Old English had been established in what is now southeastern Scotland as far as the River Forth by the seventh century, as the region was part of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria. Middle Irish was the then language of the Scottish court and the common use of Old English remained largely confined to this area until the thirteenth century. \n\nThe succeeding variety of Early northern Middle English spoken in southeastern Scotland was also known as Early Scots. It began to further diverge from the Middle English of Northumbria due to twelfth and thirteenth century immigration of Scandinavian-influenced Middle English-speakers from the North and Midlands of England. Later influences on the development of Scots came from the Romance languages via ecclesiastical and legal Latin, Norman French, and later Parisian French, due to the Auld Alliance. Additionally, there were Dutch and Middle Low German influences due to trade with and immigration from the Low Countries. Scots also includes loan words in the legal and administrative fields resulting from contact with Middle Irish, and reflected in early medieval legal documents. Contemporary Scottish Gaelic loans are mainly for geographical and cultural features, such as \"ceilidh\", \"loch\" and \"clan\".\n\nFrom the thirteenth century, the Early Scots language spread further into Scotland via the burghs, which were proto-urban institutions first established by King David I. In the fourteenth century Scotland, the growth in prestige of Early Scots and the complementary decline of French, made Scots the prestige dialect of most of eastern Scotland. By the sixteenth century Middle Scots had established orthographic and literary norms largely independent of those developing in England. \n\nFrom 1610 to the 1690s during the Plantation of Ulster some 200,000 Scots-speaking Lowlanders settled in Ulster in Ireland. In the core areas of Scots settlement, Scots outnumbered English settlers by five or six to one. \n\nThe name Modern Scots is used to describe the Scots language after 1700, when southern Modern English was generally adopted as the literary language, though Modern Scots remained the vernacular.\n\nIn Scotland, Scots is spoken in the Scottish Lowlands, the Northern Isles, Caithness, Arran and Campbeltown. In Ulster (Ireland) it is spoken in the Counties of Down, Antrim, Londonderry and Donegal. Dialects include Insular Scots, Northern Scots, Central Scots, Southern Scots and Ulster Scots.\n\nBefore the Treaty of Union 1707, when Scotland and England joined to form the Kingdom of Great Britain, there is ample evidence that Scots was widely held to be an independent sister language forming a pluricentric diasystem with English.\n\nThe linguist Heinz Kloss considered Modern Scots a \"Halbsprache\" (half language) in terms of an abstand and ausbau languages framework although today, in Scotland, most people's speech is somewhere on a continuum ranging from traditional broad Scots to Scottish Standard English. Many speakers are either diglossic and/or able to code-switch along the continuum depending on the situation in which they find themselves. Where on this continuum English-influenced Scots becomes Scots-influenced English is difficult to determine. Because standard English now generally has the role of a Dachsprache, disputes often arise as to whether the varieties of Scots are dialects of Scottish English or constitute a separate language in their own right.\n\nThe UK government now accepts Scots as a regional language and has recognised it as such under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.\n\nEvidence for its existence as a separate language lies in the extensive body of Scots literature, its independent – if somewhat fluid – orthographic conventions and in its former use as the language of the original Parliament of Scotland. Because Scotland retained distinct political, legal, and religious systems after the Union, many Scots terms passed into Scottish English.\n\nFrom the mid-sixteenth century, written Scots was increasingly influenced by the developing Standard English of Southern England due to developments in royal and political interactions with England.\n\nWhen an English herald spoke to Mary of Guise and her councillors in 1560, at first they spoke in the \"Scottyshe toung\", but then he \"not well understanding\", they continued in her native French. King James VI, who in 1603 became James I of England, observed in his work \"The Reulis and Cautelis to be observit and eschewit in Scottis Prose\" that \"For albeit sindrie has written of it in Engish, quhilk is lykest to our language ...\" however, with the increasing influence and availability of books printed in England, most writing in Scotland came to be done in the English fashion. Following James VI's move to London, the Protestant Church of Scotland adopted the 1611 Authorized King James Version of the Bible; subsequently, the Acts of Union 1707 led to England joining Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain, having a single Parliament of Great Britain based in London. After the Union and the shift of political power to England, the use of Scots was discouraged by many in authority and education, as was the notion of Scottishness itself. Many leading Scots of the period, such as David Hume, defined themselves as Northern British rather than Scottish. They attempted to rid themselves of their Scots in a bid to establish standard English as the official language of the newly formed union. Nevertheless, Scots was still spoken across a wide range of domains until the end of the eighteenth century, illustrated for example, in the summary by Frederick Pottle, James Boswell's twentieth-century biographer, concerning James's view of the speech habits of his father Alexander Boswell, a judge of the Supreme Courts of Scotland:\n\nOthers did however scorn Scots, such as intellectuals from the Scottish Enlightenment David Hume and Adam Smith, who went to great lengths to get rid of every Scotticism from their writings. Following such examples, many well-off Scots took to learning English through the activities of those such as Thomas Sheridan, who in 1761 gave a series of lectures on English elocution. Charging a guinea at a time (about £ in today's money), they were attended by over 300 men, and he was made a freeman of the City of Edinburgh. Following this, some of the city's intellectuals formed the Select Society for Promoting the Reading and Speaking of the English Language in Scotland. From such eighteenth-century activities grew Scottish Standard English. Scots remained the vernacular of many rural communities and the growing number of urban working-class Scots.\nIn the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the use of Scots as a literary language was revived by several prominent Scotsmen such as Robert Burns. Such writers established a new cross-dialect literary norm.\n\nDuring the first half of the twentieth century, knowledge of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century literary norms waned, and currently there is no institutionalised standard literary form. By the 1940s, the Scottish Education Department's language policy was that Scots had no value: \"it is not the language of 'educated' people anywhere, and could not be described as a suitable medium of education or culture\". Students reverted to Scots outside the classroom, but the reversion was not complete. What occurred, and has been occurring ever since, is a process of language attrition, whereby successive generations have adopted more and more features from Standard English. This process has accelerated rapidly since widespread access to mass media in English and increased population mobility became available after the Second World War. It has recently taken on the nature of wholesale language shift, sometimes also termed language change, convergence or merger. By the end of the twentieth century, Scots was at an advanced stage of language death over much of Lowland Scotland. Residual features of Scots are often regarded as slang. A Scottish Government study in 2010 found that 64% of respondents (being a representative sample of Scotland's adult population) \"don't really think of Scots as a language\", however, \"the most frequent speakers are least likely to agree that it is not a language (58%) and those never speaking Scots most likely to do so (72%)\".\n\nRecently, attitudes have somewhat changed, and the status of the language has been raised in schools in Scotland. Scots is now included in the new national school curriculum. Previously in Scotland's schools there had been little education taking place through the medium of Scots, although it may have been covered superficially in English lessons, which could entail reading some Scots literature and observing the local dialect. Much of the material used was often Standard English disguised as Scots, which caused upset among proponents of Standard English and proponents of Scots alike. One example of the educational establishment's approach to Scots is, \"Write a poem in Scots. (It is important not to be worried about spelling in this – write as you hear the sounds in your head.)\", whereas guidelines for English require teaching pupils to be \"writing fluently and legibly with accurate spelling and punctuation\".\n\nThe use of Scots in the media is scant and is usually reserved for niches where local dialect is deemed acceptable, e.g. comedy, Burns Night, or representations of traditions and times gone by. Serious use for news, encyclopaedias, documentaries, etc., rarely occurs in Scots, although the Scottish Parliament website has offered some information in it.\n\nIt has been difficult to determine the number of speakers of Scots via census, because many respondents might interpret the question \"Do you speak Scots?\" in different ways. Campaigners for Scots pressed for this question to be included in the 2001 UK National Census. The results from a 1996 trial before the Census, by the General Register Office for Scotland, suggested that there were around 1.5 million speakers of Scots, with 30% of Scots responding \"Yes\" to the question \"Can you speak the Scots language?\", but only 17% responding \"Aye\" to the question \"Can you speak Scots?\". (It was also found that older, working-class people were more likely to answer in the affirmative.) The University of Aberdeen Scots Leid Quorum performed its own research in 1995, cautiously suggesting that there were 2.7 million speakers, though with clarification as to why these figures required context.\n\nThe GRO questions, as freely acknowledged by those who set them, were not as detailed and as systematic as the University of Aberdeen ones, and only included reared speakers, not those who had learned the language. Part of the difference resulted from the central question posed by surveys: \"Do you speak Scots?\". In the Aberdeen University study, the question was augmented with the further clause \"... or a dialect of Scots such as Border etc.\", which resulted in greater recognition from respondents. The GRO concluded that there simply was not enough linguistic self-awareness amongst the Scottish populace, with people still thinking of themselves as speaking badly pronounced, grammatically inferior English rather than Scots, for an accurate census to be taken. The GRO research concluded that \"[a] more precise estimate of genuine Scots language ability would require a more in-depth interview survey and may involve asking various questions about the language used in different situations. Such an approach would be inappropriate for a Census.\" Thus, although it was acknowledged that the \"inclusion of such a Census question would undoubtedly raise the profile of Scots\", no question about Scots was, in the end, included in the 2001 Census. The Scottish Government's \"Pupils in Scotland Census 2008\" found that 306 pupils spoke Scots as their main home language. A Scottish Government study in 2010 found that 85% of around 1000 respondents (being a representative sample of Scotland's adult population) claim to speak Scots to varying degrees.\n\nThe 2011 UK census was the first to ask residents of Scotland about Scots. A campaign called Aye Can was set up to help individuals answer the question. The specific wording used was \"Which of these can you do? Tick all that apply\" with options for 'Understand', 'Speak', 'Read' and 'Write' in three columns: English, Scottish Gaelic and Scots. Of approximately 5.1 million respondents, about 1.2 million (24%) could speak, read and write Scots, 3.2 million (62%) had no skills in Scots and the remainder had some degree of skill, such as understanding Scots (0.27 million, 5.2%) or being able to speak it but not read or write it (0.18 million, 3.5%). There were also small numbers of Scots speakers recorded in England and Wales on the 2011 Census, with the largest numbers being either in bordering areas (e.g. Carlisle) or in areas that had recruited large numbers of Scottish workers in the past (e.g. Corby or the former mining areas of Kent).\n\nAmong the earliest Scots literature is John Barbour's \"Brus\" (fourteenth century), Wyntoun's \"Cronykil\" and Blind Harry's \"The Wallace\" (fifteenth century). From the fifteenth century, much literature based on the Royal Court in Edinburgh and the University of St Andrews was produced by writers such as Robert Henryson, William Dunbar, Gavin Douglas and David Lyndsay. \"The Complaynt of Scotland\" was an early printed work in Scots. The \"Eneados\" is a Middle Scots translation of Virgil's \"Aeneid\", completed by Gavin Douglas in 1513.\n\nAfter the seventeenth century, anglicisation increased. At the time, many of the oral ballads from the borders and the North East were written down. Writers of the period were Robert Sempill, Robert Sempill the younger, Francis Sempill, Lady Wardlaw and Lady Grizel Baillie.\n\nIn the eighteenth century, writers such as Allan Ramsay, Robert Burns, James Orr, Robert Fergusson and Walter Scott continued to use Scots – Burns's \"Auld Lang Syne\" is in Scots, for example. Scott introduced vernacular dialogue to his novels. Other well-known authors like Robert Louis Stevenson, William Alexander, George MacDonald, J. M. Barrie and other members of the Kailyard school like Ian Maclaren also wrote in Scots or used it in dialogue.\n\nIn the Victorian era popular Scottish newspapers regularly included articles and commentary in the vernacular, often of unprecedented proportions.\n\nIn the early twentieth century, a renaissance in the use of Scots occurred, its most vocal figure being Hugh MacDiarmid whose benchmark poem \"A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle\" (1926) did much to demonstrate the power of Scots as a modern idiom. Other contemporaries were Douglas Young, John Buchan, Sidney Goodsir Smith, Robert Garioch, Edith Anne Robertson and Robert McLellan. The revival extended to verse and other literature.\n\nIn 1955 three Ayrshire men – Sandy MacMillan, an English teacher at Ayr Academy; Thomas Limond, noted town Chamberlain of Ayr; and A.L. (Ross) Taylor, Rector of Cumnock Academy  – collaborated to write \"Bairnsangs\" (Child Songs), a collection of children's nursery rhymes and poems in Scots. The book contains a five-page glossary of contemporary Scots words and their pronunciations.\n\nAlexander Gray's translations into Scots constitute the greater part of his work, and are the main basis for his reputation.\n\nIn 1983 William Laughton Lorimer's translation of the New Testament from the original Greek was published.\n\nHighly anglicised Scots is sometimes used in contemporary fiction, for example, the Edinburgh dialect of Scots in \"Trainspotting\" by Irvine Welsh (later made into a motion picture of the same name).\n\n\"But'n'Ben A-Go-Go\" by Matthew Fitt is a cyberpunk novel written entirely in what Wir Ain Leid (Our Own Language) calls \"General Scots\". Like all cyberpunk work, it contains imaginative neologisms.\n\nThe \"Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam\" has been translated into Scots by Rab Wilson (published in 2004). Alexander Hutchison has translated the poetry of Catullus into Scots, and in the 1980s, Liz Lochhead produced a Scots translation of \"Tartuffe\" by Molière. J. K. Annand translated poetry and fiction from German and medieval Latin into Scots.\n\nThe strip cartoons \"Oor Wullie\" and \"The Broons\" in the \"Sunday Post\" use some Scots.\n\nThe orthography of Early Scots had become more or less standardised by the middle to late sixteenth century. After the Union of the Crowns in 1603 the Standard English of England came to have an increasing influence on the spelling of Scots through the increasing influence and availability of books printed in England. After the Acts of Union in 1707 the emerging Scottish form of Standard English replaced Scots for most formal writing in Scotland.\n\nThe eighteenth-century Scots revival saw the introduction of a new literary language descended from the old court Scots, but with an orthography that had abandoned some of the more distinctive old Scots spellings and adopted many standard English spellings. Despite the updated spelling, however, the rhymes make it clear that a Scots pronunciation was intended. These writings also introduced what came to be known as the apologetic apostrophe, generally occurring where a consonant exists in the Standard English cognate. This Written Scots drew not only on the vernacular but also on the King James Bible and was also heavily influenced by the norms and conventions of Augustan English poetry. Consequently, this written Scots looked very similar to contemporary Standard English, suggesting a somewhat modified version of that, rather than a distinct speech form with a phonological system which had been developing independently for many centuries. This modern literary dialect, ‘Scots of the book' or Standard Scots once again gave Scots an orthography of its own, lacking neither \"authority nor author.\" This literary language used throughout Lowland Scotland and Ulster, embodied by writers such as Allan Ramsay, Robert Fergusson, Robert Burns, Sir Walter Scott, Charles Murray, David Herbison, James Orr, James Hogg and William Laidlaw among others, is well described in the 1921 Manual of Modern Scots.\n\nOther authors developed dialect writing, preferring to represent their own speech in a more phonological manner rather than following the pan-dialect conventions of modern literary Scots, especially for the northern and insular dialects of Scots.\n\nDuring the twentieth century a number of proposals for spelling reform were presented. Commenting on this, John Corbett (2003: 260) writes that \"devising a normative orthography for Scots has been one of the greatest linguistic hobbies of the past century.\" Most proposals entailed regularising the use of established eighteenth and nineteenth century conventions, in particular the avoidance of the apologetic apostrophe which supposedly represented \"missing\" English letters. Such letters were never actually missing in Scots. For example, in the fourteenth century, Barbour spelt the Scots cognate of 'taken' as \"tane\". Because there has been no \"k\" in the word for over 700 years, representing its omission with an apostrophe seems pointless. The current spelling is usually \"taen\".\n\nThrough the twentieth century, with the decline of spoken Scots and knowledge of the literary tradition, phonetic (often humorous) representations became more common.\n\nFrom \"The New Testament in Scots\" (William Laughton Lorimer 1885–1967)\nMatthew:1:18ff\n\nModern Scots follows the subject–verb–object sentence structure as does Standard English. However, the word order \"He turnt oot the licht\" to 'He turned the light out' and \"Gie's it\" (\"Give us it\") to 'Give it to me' may be preferred.\n\nThe indefinite article \"a\" may be used before both consonants and vowels. The definite article \"the\" is used before the names of seasons, days of the week, many nouns, diseases, trades and occupations, sciences and academic subjects. It is also often used in place of the indefinite article and instead of a possessive pronoun.\n\nScots includes some strong plurals such as \"ee\"/\"een\" (eye/eyes), \"cauf\"/\"caur\" (calf/calves), \"horse\"/\"horse\" (horse/horses), \"cou\"/\"kye\" (cow/cows) and \"shae\"/\"shuin\" (shoe/shoes) that survived from Old English into Modern Scots but have become weak plurals in Standard Modern English – \"ox\"/\"oxen\" and \"child\"/\"children\" being exceptions. Nouns of measure and quantity remain unchanged in the plural.\n\nThe relative pronoun is \"that\" for all persons and numbers, but may be elided. Modern Scots also has a third adjective/adverb \"this\"-\"that\"-\"yon\"/\"yonder\" (\"thon\"/\"thonder\") indicating something at some distance. \"Thir\" and \"thae\" are the plurals of \"this\" and \"that\" respectively.\n\nThe present tense of verbs adheres to the Northern subject rule whereby verbs end in -\"s\" in all persons and numbers except when a single personal pronoun is next to the verb. Certain verbs are often used progressively and verbs of motion may be dropped before an adverb or adverbial phrase of motion.\n\nMany verbs have strong or irregular forms which are distinctive from Standard English.\nThe regular past form of the weak or regular verbs is \"-it\", \"-t\" or \"-ed\", according to the preceding consonant or vowel.\n\nThe present participle and gerund \"in\" are now usually but may still be differentiated and in Southern Scots and, and North Northern Scots.\n\nThe negative particle is \"na\", sometimes spelled \"nae\", e.g. \"canna\" (can't), \"daurna\" (daren't), \"michtna\" (mightn't).\n\nAdverbs usually take the same form as the verb root or adjective especially after verbs. \"Haein a real guid day\" (Having a really good day). \"She's awfu fauchelt\" (She's awfully tired).\n\nThe vowel system of Modern Scots:\n\nVowel length is usually conditioned by the Scottish Vowel Length Rule.\n\n\n\n"}

It is possible to draw parallels with the London street gangs of the 1890s, whose behaviour was labelled hooliganism. The social commentator Alexander Devine attributed the gang culture to lack of parental control, lack of discipline in schools, \"base literature\" and the monotony of life in Manchester's slums.\n\nGangs were formed throughout the slums of central Manchester, in the townships of Bradford, Gorton and Openshaw to the east and in Salford, to the west of the city. Gang conflicts erupted in Manchester in the early 1870s and went on sporadically for thirty years, declining in frequency and severity by the late 1890s.\n\nScuttlers distinguished themselves from other young men in working-class neighbourhoods by their distinctive clothing. They generally wore a uniform of brass-tipped pointed clogs, bell-bottomed trousers, cut like a sailor's (\"bells\" that measured fourteen inches round the knee and twenty-one inches round the foot) and \"flashy\" silk scarves. Their hair was cut short at the back and sides, but they grew long fringes, known as \"donkey fringes\", that were longer on the left side and plastered down on the forehead over the left eye. Peaked caps were also worn tilted to the left to display the fringe. The scuttlers' girlfriends also had a distinctive style of dress consisting of clogs, shawl, and a vertically striped skirt.\n\nScuttling gangs were territorial fighting gangs, as reflected in their names; the Bengal Tigers came from the cluster of streets and courts off Bengal Street in Ancoats. Most gangs took their names from a local thoroughfare, such as Holland Street, Miles Platting, or Hope Street, Salford.\nGang members fought with a variety of weapons, but they all carried knives and wore heavy buckled belts, often decorated with pictures such as serpents, scorpions, hearts pierced with arrows or women's names. The thick leather belts were their most prized possessions and were wrapped tightly around the wrist at the onset of a \"scuttle\", so that the buckle could be used to strike at opponents. The use of knives and belts was designed to maim and disfigure rather than to kill.\n\nSome of the clashes between rival gangs involved large numbers; the \"Gorton Reporter\" described one such instance in May 1879 as involving more than 500 people. Scuttling reached a peak in 1890–91; it was said that by 1890 more youths were held in Strangeways Prison for scuttling than for any other offence.\n\nBy the turn of the century the gangs had all but died out owing to some of the worst slums having been cleared, the setting up of Working Lads' Clubs (such as Salford Lads' Club) to engage the working youths in more peaceful\nactivities, the spread of street football and the advent of the cinema.\n\nOne initiative to provide an alternative to gang warfare resulted in the formation of St Marks (West Gorton) Football Club, which later became Manchester City FC. In 1997 the Manchester historian Gary James highlighted that scuttling was the number one unifying activity of young men, and that the creation of St Mark's Football Club was a very serious attempt at diverting the young men of West Gorton into more worthwhile activities. Anna Connell, perceived by many as the founder of St Mark's FC, also helped create men's meetings, a library, and other society improving facilities and clubs.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n"}
{"id": "3193582", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3193582", "title": "Sociology of culture", "text": "Sociology of culture\n\nThe sociology of culture, and the related cultural sociology, concerns the systematic analysis of culture, usually understood as the ensemble of symbolic codes used by a members of a society, as it is manifested in the society. For Georg Simmel, culture referred to \"the cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history\". Culture in the sociological field is analyzed as the ways of thinking and describing, acting, and the material objects that together shape a group of people's way of life.\n\nContemporary sociologists' approach to culture is often divided between a \"sociology of culture\" and \"cultural sociology\"—the terms are similar, though not interchangeable. The \"sociology of culture\" is an older concept, and considers some topics and objects as more-or-less \"cultural\" than others. By way of contrast, Jeffrey C. Alexander introduced the term \"cultural sociology\", an approach that sees all, or most, social phenomena as inherently cultural at some level. For instance, a leading proponent of the \"strong program\" in cultural sociology, Alexander argues: \"To believe in the possibility of cultural sociology is to subscribe to the idea that every action, no matter how instrumental, reflexive, or coerced [compared to] its external environment, is embedded to some extent in a horizon of affect and meaning.\" In terms of analysis, sociology of culture often attempts to explain some discretely cultural phenomena as a product of social processes, while cultural sociology sees culture as a component of explanations of social phenomena. As opposed to the field of cultural studies, cultural sociology does not reduce all human matters to a problem of cultural encoding and decoding. For instance, Pierre Bourdieu's cultural sociology has a \"clear recognition of the social and the economic as categories which are interlinked with, but not reducible to, the cultural.\"\n\nCultural sociology first emerged in Weimar, Germany, where sociologists such as Alfred Weber used the term \"Kultursoziologie\" (cultural sociology). Cultural sociology was then \"reinvented\" in the English-speaking world as a product of the \"cultural turn\" of the 1960s, which ushered in structuralist and postmodern approaches to social science. This type of cultural sociology may loosely be regarded as an approach incorporating cultural analysis and critical theory. In the beginning of the cultural turn, sociologists tended to use qualitative methods and hermeneutic approaches to research, focusing on meanings, words, artifacts and symbols. \"Culture\" has since become an important concept across many branches of sociology, including historically quantitative and model-based subfields, such as social stratification and social network analysis.\n\nThe sociology of culture grew from the intersection between sociology, as shaped by early theorists like Marx, Durkheim, and Weber, and anthropology where researchers pioneered ethnographic strategies for describing and analyzing a variety of cultures around the world. \nPart of the legacy of the early development of the field is still felt in the methods (much of cultural sociological research is qualitative) in the theories (a variety of critical approaches to sociology are central to current research communities) and substantive focus of the field. For instance, relationships between popular culture, political control, and social class were early and lasting concerns in the field.\n\nAs a major contributor to conflict theory, Marx argued that culture served to justify inequality. The ruling class, or the bourgeoisie, produce a culture that promotes their interests, while repressing the interests of the proletariat. \nHis most famous line to this effect is that \"Religion is the opium of the people\".\nMarx believed that the \"engine of history\" was the struggle between groups of people with diverging economic interests and thus the economy determined the cultural superstructure of values and ideologies. For this reason, Marx is a considered a \"materialist\" as he believes that the economic (material) produces the cultural (ideal), which \"stands Hegel on his head,\" who argued the ideal produced the material.\n\nDurkheim held the belief that culture has many relationships to society which include:\n\nWeber innovated the idea of a status group as a certain type of subculture. Status groups are based on things such as: race, ethnicity, religion, region, occupation, gender, sexual preference, etc. These groups live a certain lifestyle based on different values and norms. They are a culture within a culture, hence the label subculture. Weber also purported the idea that people were motivated by their material and ideal interests, which include things such as preventing one from going to hell. Weber also explains that people use symbols to express their spirituality, that symbols are used to express the spiritual side of real events, and that ideal interests are derived from symbols.\n\nFor Simmel, culture refers to \"the cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history.\" Simmel presented his analyses within a context of \"form\" and \"content\". Sociological concept and analysis can be viewed.\n\nAs no two cultures are exactly alike they do all have common characteristics.\nA culture contains:\n\n1. Social Organization: Structured by organizing its members into smaller numbers to meet the cultures specific requirements. Social classes ranked in order of importance (status) based on the cultures core values. In example: money, job, education, family, etc. \n\n2. Customs and Traditions: Rules of behavior enforced by the cultures ideas of right and wrong such as is customs, traditions, rules, or written laws.\n\n3. Symbols: Any thing that carries particular meaning recognized by people who share the same culture.\n\n4. Norms: Rules and expectations by which a society guides the behavior of its members. The two types of norms are mores and folkways. Mores are norms that are widely observed and have a great moral significance. Folkways are norms for routine, casual interaction.\n\n5. Religion: The answers to their basic meanings of life and values.\n\n6. Language: A system of symbols that allows people to communicate with one another.\n\n7. Arts and Literature: Products of human imagination made into art, music, literature, stories, and dance.\n\n8. Forms of Government: How the culture distributes power. Who keeps the order within the society, who protects them from danger, and who provides for their needs. Can fall into terms such as Democracy, Republic, or Dictatorship.\n\n9. Economic Systems: What to produce, how to produce it, and for whom. How people use their limited resources to satisfy their wants and needs. Can fall into the terms Traditional Economy, Market Economy, Command Economy, Mixed Economy.\n\n10. Artifacts: Distinct material objects, such as architecture, technologies, and artistic creations.\n\n11. Social institutions: Patterns of organization and relationships regarding governance, production, socializing, education, knowledge creation, arts, and relating to other cultures.\nIn an anthropological sense, culture is society based on the values and ideas without influence of the material world.\n\nCulture is like the shell of a lobster. Human nature is the organism living inside of that shell. The shell, culture, identifies the organism, or human nature. Culture is what sets human nature apart, and helps direct the life of human nature.\n\nAnthropologists lay claim to the establishment of modern uses of the culture concept as defined by Edward Burnett Tylor in the mid-19th century.\n\nMalinowski collected data from the Trobriand Islands. Descent groups across the island claim parts of the land, and to back up those claims, they tell myths of how an ancestress started a clan and how the clan descends from that ancestress. Malinowski's observations followed the research of that found by Durkheim.\n\nRadcliffe-Brown put himself in the culture of the Andaman Islanders. His research showed that group solidification among the islanders is based on music and kinship, and the rituals that involve the use of those activities. In the words of Radcliffe-Brown, \"Ritual fortifies Society\".\n\nMarcel Mauss made many comparative studies on religion, magic, law and morality of occidental and non-occidental societies, and developed the concept of total social fact, and argued that the reciprocity is the universal logic of the cultural interaction.\n\nLévi-Strauss, based, at the same time, on the sociological and anthropological positivism of Durkheim, Mauss, Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown, on the economic and sociological marxism, on freudian and Gestalt psychology and on structural linguistics of Saussure and Jakobson, realized great studies on areas myth, kinship, religion, ritual, symbolism, magic, ideology (souvage pensée), knowledge, art and aesthetics, applying the methodological structuralism on his investigations. He searched the universal principals of human thought as a form of explaining social behaviors and structures.\n\nFrench sociologist Pierre Bourdieu's influential model of society and social relations has its roots in Marxist theories of class and conflict. Bourdieu characterizes social relations in the context of what he calls the \"field\", defined as a competitive system of social relations functioning according to its own specific logic or rules. The \"field\" is the site of struggle for power between the dominant and subordinate classes. It is within the \"field\" that legitimacy—a key aspect defining the dominant class—is conferred or withdrawn.\n\nBourdieu's theory of practice is practical rather than discursive, embodied as well as cognitive and durable though adaptive. A valid concern that sets the agenda in Bourdieu's theory of practice is how action follows regular statistical patterns without the product of accordance to rules, norms and/or conscious intention. To explain this concern, Bourdieu explains habitus and field. Habitus explains the mutually penetrating realities of individual subjectivity and societal objectivity after the function of social construction. It is employed to transcend the subjective and objective dichotomy.\n\nThe belief that culture is symbolically coded and can thus be taught from one person to another means that cultures, although bounded, can change. Cultures are both predisposed to change and resistant to it. Resistance can come from habit, religion, and the integration and interdependence of cultural traits.\n\nCultural change can have many causes, including: the environment, inventions, and contact with other cultures.\n\nSeveral understandings of how cultures change come from anthropology. For instance, in diffusion theory, the form of something moves from one culture to another, but not its meaning. For example, the ankh symbol originated in Egyptian culture but has diffused to numerous cultures. Its original meaning may have been lost, but it is now used by many practitioners of New Age religion as an arcane symbol of power or life forces. A variant of the diffusion theory, stimulus diffusion, refers to an element of one culture leading to an invention in another.\n\nContact between cultures can also result in acculturation. Acculturation has different meanings, but in this context refers to replacement of the traits of one culture with those of another, such as what happened with many Native American Indians. Related processes on an individual level are assimilation and transculturation, both of which refer to adoption of a different culture by an individual.\n\nGriswold outlined another sociological approach to cultural change. Griswold points out that it may seem as though culture comes from individuals – which, for certain elements of cultural change, is true – but there is also the larger, collective, and long-lasting culture that cannot have been the creation of single individuals as it predates and post-dates individual humans and contributors to culture. The author presents a sociological perspective to address this conflict.\n\nSociology suggests an alternative to both the view that it has always been an unsatisfying way at one extreme and the sociological individual genius view at the other. This alternative posits that culture and cultural works are collective, not individual, creations. We can best understand specific cultural objects... by seeing them not as unique to their creators but as the fruits of collective production, fundamentally social in their genesis. (p. 53)\nIn short, Griswold argues that culture changes through the contextually dependent and socially situated actions of individuals; macro-level culture influences the individual who, in turn, can influence that same culture. The logic is a bit circular, but illustrates how culture can change over time yet remain somewhat constant.\n\nIt is, of course, important to recognize here that Griswold is talking about cultural change and not the actual origins of culture (as in, \"there was no culture and then, suddenly, there was\"). Because Griswold does not explicitly distinguish between the origins of cultural change and the origins of culture, it may appear as though Griswold is arguing here for the origins of culture and situating these origins in society. This is neither accurate nor a clear representation of sociological thought on this issue. Culture, just like society, has existed since the beginning of humanity (humans being social and cultural). Society and culture co-exist because humans have social relations and meanings tied to those relations (e.g. brother, lover, friend). Culture as a super-phenomenon has no real beginning except in the sense that humans (homo sapiens) have a beginning. This, then, makes the question of the origins of culture moot – it has existed as long as we have, and will likely exist as long as we do. Cultural change, on the other hand, is a matter that can be questioned and researched, as Griswold does.\n\nCulture theory, developed in the 1980s and 1990s, sees audiences as playing an active rather than passive role in relation to mass media. One strand of research focuses on the audiences and how they interact with media; the other strand of research focuses on those who produce the media, particularly the news.\n\nComputer-mediated communication (CMC) is the process of sending messages—primarily, but not limited to text messages—through the direct use by participants of computers and communication networks. By restricting the definition to the direct use of computers in the communication process, you have to get rid of the communication technologies that rely upon computers for switching technology (such as telephony or compressed video), but do not require the users to interact directly with the computer system via a keyboard or similar computer interface. To be mediated by computers in the sense of this project, the communication must be done by participants fully aware of their interaction with the computer technology in the process of creating and delivering messages. Given the current state of computer communications and networks, this limits CMC to primarily text-based messaging, while leaving the possibility of incorporating sound, graphics, and video images as the technology becomes more sophisticated.\n\nCultural activities are institutionalised; the focus on institutional settings leads to the investigation \"of activities in the cultural sector, conceived as historically evolved societal forms of organising the conception, production, distribution, propagation, interpretation, reception, conservation and maintenance of specific cultural goods\". Cultural Institutions Studies is therefore a specific approach within the sociology of culture.\n\nKey figures in today's cultural sociology include: Julia Adams, Jeffrey Alexander, John Carroll, Diane Crane, Paul DiMaggio, Henning Eichberg, Ron Eyerman, Sarah Gatson, Andreas Glaeser, Wendy Griswold, Eva Illouz, Karin Knorr-Cetina, Michele Lamont, Annette Lareau, Stjepan Mestrovic, Philip Smith, Margaret Somers, Yasemin Soysal, Dan Sperber, Lynette Spillman, Ann Swidler, Diane Vaughan, and Viviana Zelizer.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "242123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=242123", "title": "The Diary of a Nobody", "text": "The Diary of a Nobody\n\nThe Diary of a Nobody is an English comic novel written by the brothers George and Weedon Grossmith, with illustrations by the latter. It originated as an intermittent serial in \"Punch\" magazine in 1888–89 and first appeared in book form, with extended text and added illustrations, in 1892. The \"Diary\" records the daily events in the lives of a London clerk, Charles Pooter, his wife Carrie, his son Lupin, and numerous friends and acquaintances over a period of 15 months.\n\nBefore their collaboration on the \"Diary\", the brothers each pursued successful careers on the stage. George originated nine of the principal comedian roles in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas over 12 years from 1877 to 1889. He also established a national reputation as a piano sketch entertainer and wrote a large number of songs and comic pieces. Before embarking on his stage career, Weedon had worked as an artist and illustrator. The \"Diary\" was the brothers' only mature collaboration. Most of its humour derives from Charles Pooter's unconscious and unwarranted sense of his own importance, and the frequency with which this delusion is punctured by gaffes and minor social humiliations. In an era of rising expectations within the lower-middle classes, the daily routines and modest ambitions described in the \"Diary\" were instantly recognised by its contemporary readers, and provided later generations with a glimpse of the past that it became fashionable to imitate.\n\nAlthough its initial public reception was muted, the \"Diary\" came to be recognised by critics as a classic work of humour, and it has never been out of print. It helped to establish a genre of humorous popular fiction based on lower or lower-middle class aspirations, and was the forerunner of numerous fictitious diary novels in the later 20th century. The \"Diary\" has been the subject of several stage and screen adaptations, including Ken Russell's \"silent film\" treatment of 1964, a four-part TV film scripted by Andrew Davies in 2007, and a widely praised stage version in 2011, in which an all-male cast of three played all the parts.\n\n\"The Diary of a Nobody\" was the work of George Grossmith and his brother Weedon Grossmith, the sons of a court reporter and part-time stage entertainer, also named George. The younger George followed his father, first as a reporter and later on the stage; the 7-years-younger Weedon studied at the West London School of Art and had some success as a portrait painter before becoming a comic actor. The brothers were fascinated with the stage at an early age. In 1864, at 17 and 10, they hosted a complex programme of musical and dramatic entertainment in their parents' garden at Haverstock Hill. This included a 20-minute burlesque version of \"Hamlet\", in which George played the title role; Weedon was Ophelia.\n\nBy 1877 the younger George Grossmith had established himself as a comic piano sketch entertainer in provincial institutes and literary societies. In that year he was seen by Arthur Sullivan and, separately, by W. S. Gilbert, in performances of their one-act comic opera \"Trial by Jury\". Impressed, they engaged him to play the comic lead in their new, full-length work, \"The Sorcerer\". Thereafter, Grossmith created the leading comic role in each of Gilbert and Sullivan's long-running comic operas until \"The Yeomen of the Guard\", which closed in 1889. While appearing in the operas, Grossmith continued his piano entertainment career at private parties and matinees, writing and composing his own material. He became the most successful comic entertainer of his day, writing numerous operettas, around 100 piano sketches, some 600 songs and short piano pieces, and three books. For \"Punch\" magazine in 1884 he provided a series of short sketches based on his experiences as a court reporter at Bow Street Magistrates' Court. In 1889, Grossmith ended his connection with Gilbert and Sullivan to pursue his piano sketch career full-time and continued to perform until 1908. He died in 1912.\n\nAs an artist Weedon Grossmith exhibited at the Royal Academy and at the Grosvenor Gallery. He also contributed illustrations to \"Punch\" and the prestigious \"Art Journal\". He was nevertheless dissatisfied with his financial prospects as an artist, and by 1885 was pursuing an alternative career as an actor. He continued his career on the stage with considerable success until 1918, making his name playing roles he described as \"cowards, cads and snobs\", and as browbeaten small men under the thumb of authority. He wrote several plays, of which \"The Night of the Party\" (1901) was his most successful, and from 1894 was engaged in the management of two West End theatres. He died in 1919. The literary scholar Peter Morton, who published an annotated edition of the \"Diary\" in 2009, suggests that many of the events depicted in it were drawn from the brothers' own home experiences, and that Weedon, \"something of a scapegrace compared with his perfectionist brother\", was the model for Lupin.\n\nThe diary begins on 3 April of an unstated year, and runs for approximately 15 months. In a short prologue, readers are informed that Charles Pooter and his wife Caroline (Carrie) have just moved to a new home at \"The Laurels\", Brickfield Terrace, Holloway. Mr Pooter is a City of London clerk with Perkupps, possibly an accountancy or private banking firm (though their business is not explicitly stated). The couple's 20-year-old son William works as a bank clerk in Oldham. The first entries describe the Pooters' daily lives and introduce their particular friends, such as their neighbour Gowing, the enthusiastic bicyclist Cummings, and the Jameses from Sutton. From the beginning a pattern is set whereby the small vexations of the Pooters' daily lives are recounted, many of them arising from Pooter's unconscious self-importance and pomposity. Trouble with servants, tradesmen, and office juniors occur regularly, along with minor social embarrassments and humiliations.\n\nThe rare formal social events in the Pooters' lives are particular magnets for misfortune. They receive an invitation from the Lord Mayor of London to attend a ball at the Mansion House for \"Representatives of Trade and Commerce\". After days of keen anticipation they are dismayed, when they arrive, to find that the gathering is undistinguished. Pooter is snobbishly upset to be greeted familiarly by his local ironmonger, even more so when this tradesman appears to be on social terms with some of the more important guests. Pooter overindulges in champagne and humiliates Carrie by collapsing on the dance floor.\n\nIn the summer their son arrives from Oldham and informs his parents that he wishes henceforth to be called by his middle name, \"Lupin.\" He has been dismissed from his bank post for idleness; although dismayed, Pooter sees this as a chance to get his son into Perkupps. Lupin joins the couple for their annual holiday week in Broadstairs, but relationships are strained by Lupin's \"fast\" habits. On their return, Pooter's efforts to find Lupin a job at first prove fruitless. The boy is interested in amateur dramatics and joins an organisation called the \"Holloway Comedians\". With the help of Pooter's employer Mr. Perkupp, Lupin finally secures a clerical position with a firm of stockbrokers in November. He then shocks his parents by announcing his engagement.\n\nLupin's fiancée, Daisy Mutlar, is the sister of one of his theatrical friends and is, he says, \"the nicest, prettiest, and most accomplished girl he ever met\". Pooter is disappointed when he meets her: \"She is a big young woman... at least eight years older than Lupin. I did not even think her good-looking\". Nevertheless, in her honour the Pooters give a large dinner-party, to which Pooter invites Mr Perkupp. The party becomes boisterous; Mr Perkupp arrives at a particularly raucous moment, and decides not to stay. Pooter believes the party has failed, and is despondent, although Carrie deems it a great success. However, within a few days, Lupin informs them that the engagement is off.\n\nIn the following weeks Lupin often brings the Holloway troupe back to \"The Laurels\". These occasions are graced with the unexplained presence of a complete stranger, Mr Padge, who regularly occupies the best chair as if of right. Lupin opts out of the family's Christmas celebrations, and then announces, to everyone's astonishment, that the engagement to Daisy is back on. Christmas passes happily enough, despite a supper party which degenerates into a food fight instigated by Daisy.\n\nIn the New Year, Pooter is promoted to senior clerk at Perkupp's, and his salary raised by £100 a year, but his achievement is overshadowed by Lupin's announcement that he has just profited by £200 through a timely shares speculation. Lupin persuades his father, and Gowing and Cummings, to invest small sums in Parachikka Chlorates, the source of his gains. The Pooters meet a new friend of Lupin's, Mr Murray Posh, who Pooter thinks is somewhat over-familiar with Daisy and might, he warns Lupin, be a rival for her hand. Lupin pooh-poohs this notion. Later, Pooter learns that he and his friends have lost their investment; indeed, Lupin's stockbroking firm has collapsed entirely and its principal has fled. Lupin is thus unemployed; worse, that same day the engagement of Daisy Mutlar to Murray Posh is announced. Lupin's only consolation, he tells his father, is that he persuaded Posh to invest £600 in Parachikka Chlorates. However, in Pooter's eyes the situation is redeemed when Mr Perkupp offers Lupin a clerkship.\n\nApril begins with another social disaster. The Pooters receive an invitation to a ball given by the East Acton Rifle Brigade, which they imagine will be a glittering occasion. It turns out to be shabby and down-at-heel; furthermore, having liberally supplied fellow-guests—among them Mr Padge—with food and drink which he thinks is free, Pooter is presented at the end with a large bill that he can barely afford to pay. Other social events also turn sour: a lunch party with Mr Finsworth, the father of an old friend, is marred by some unfortunate comments by Pooter on the Finsworth family portraits. On another occasion they meet a loud and over-opinionated American, Mr Hardfur Huttle who, Pooter realises, is like a mature version of Lupin.\n\nLupin is sacked from Perkupps for persuading their top client, Mr Crowbillion, to take his business to another firm. Pooter is mortified, but the new firm rewards Lupin with £25 commission and a job at £200 a year. Lupin resumes his friendship with Murray Posh and Daisy, who is now Mrs Posh. Lupin moves to lodgings in Bayswater, where Pooter and Carrie are invited to dine and where they meet Murray's sister, known as \"Lillie Girl\", a woman of around 30. Pooter learns that Murray Posh has settled £10,000 on both Daisy and \"Lillie Girl\".\n\nPooter is summoned to meet Hardfur Huttle, who offers Perkupps a new client to replace Mr Crowbillion. Perkupp is so grateful to Pooter for this introduction that he buys up the freehold of \"The Laurels\" and presents the deeds to Pooter. As the couple celebrate, a letter arrives from Lupin announcing his engagement to \"Lillie Girl\": \"We shall be married in August, and among our guests we hope to see your old friends Gowing and Cummings\".\n\nThe \"Diary\" made its initial appearance as an intermittent serial in the satirical weekly magazine \"Punch\". The first of the 26 instalments was announced in the issue of 26 May 1888 with a brief editorial note: \"As everybody who is anybody is publishing Reminiscences, Diaries, Notes, Autobiographies, and Recollections, we are sincerely grateful to 'A Nobody' for permitting us to add to the historic collection\". The diary entry dates are several weeks behind the dates on which they appear in \"Punch\".\nThe \"Punch\" serialisation ended in May 1889 with the diary entry for 21 March, which records the Pooters and their friends celebrating the minor triumph of Lupin's appointment as a clerk at Perkupps. That was the intended end of the diary; however, when the writers were preparing the manuscript for publication as a book, they added a further four months' entries to the text, and included 26 illustrations by Weedon Grossmith.\n\nIn June 1892 J.W. Arrowsmith Ltd published the \"Diary\" in book form, although its critical and popular success was not evident until the third edition appeared in October 1910. After the First World War the book's popularity continued to grow; regular reprintings and new editions ensured that thereafter the book was never out of print. Audiobook versions have been available since 1982. The writer Robert McCrum, in a personal list of \"The 100 greatest novels of all time\" published in \"The Observer\" newspaper, listed the \"Diary\" at number 35.\n\nThe \"Punch\" serialisation attracted little critical comment; \"The Athenaeum\"s literary critic thought the series \"may have escaped unnoticed amid better jokes\". When the \"Diary\" was published as a book, \"Punch\" heralded it in its issue of 23 July 1892 as \"very funny\", adding: \"not without a touch of pathos\". However, apart from a warmly approving report in \"The Saturday Review\", the book's initial critical reception was lukewarm. The \"Review\"s critic thought the book \"admirable, and in some of its touches [it] goes close to genius\", with a natural and irresistible appeal: \"The \"Diary\" has amused us from cover to cover\". This contrasted with the negative judgement of \"The Athenaeum\", which opined that \"the book has no merit to compensate for its hopeless vulgarity, not even that of being amusing\". It questioned the tastefulness of jokes aimed almost exclusively at the poverty of underpaid city clerks, and concluded: \"Besides, it is all so dull\". \"The Speaker\"s critic thought the book \"a study in vulgarity\", while \"The New York Times\", reviewing the first American edition, found the work largely incomprehensible: \"There is that kind of quiet, commonplace, everyday joking in it which we are to suppose is highly satisfactory to our cousins across the water ... Our way of manufacturing fun is different\". Although details of sales figures are not given, Arrowsmiths later acknowledged that the early editions of the book did not have a wide public impact.\n\nBy 1910 the \"Diary\" was beginning to achieve a reputation in London's literary and political circles. In his essay \"On People in Books\", published earlier that year, the writer and humourist Hilaire Belloc hailed the \"Diary\" as \"one of the half-dozen immortal achievements of our time ... a glory for us all\". Among others who recorded their appreciation of the work were Lord Rosebery, the former prime minister who told Arrowsmiths that he thought he had \"purchased and given away more copies than any living man ... I regard any bedroom I occupy as unfurnished without a copy of it\". Another essayist-cum-politician who added his tribute was Augustine Birrell, who in 1910 occupied the cabinet post of Chief Secretary for Ireland. Birrell wrote that he ranked Charles Pooter alongside Don Quixote as a comic literary figure, and added a note of personal pride that one of the characters in the book—\"an illiterate charwoman, it is true\"—carried his name. Arrowsmiths printed these appreciations as prefaces in the 1910 and subsequent issues. The 1910 edition proved immediately popular with the reading public, and was followed by numerous reprintings. In its review of this edition \"The Bookman\" s critic wrote of Charles Pooter: \"You laugh at him—at his small absurdities, his droll mishaps, his well-meaning fussiness; but he wins upon you and obtains your affection, and even your admiration, he is so transparently honest, so delightfully and ridiculously human\".\n\nIn its review of the book's fourth edition, published in 1919, \"The Bookman\" observed that the book was now a firm favourite with the public. \"It has had many imitators ... but not one of them has rivalled the original, and they have all faded away\". The reviewer recommended the book's \"quaint drollery, its whimsical satire and delightfully quiet irony\". In Canada, \"Queen's Quarterly\" magazine's sympathetic reception of the book contrasted with that of the \"New York Times\" nearly 30 years previously. It praises the understated but lovable self-portrait of Pooter, and adds that \"It is not till the second or third reading—and you are bound to reread it—that the really consummate art of this artless book becomes apparent\". The literary critic D. B. Wyndham Lewis summarised the Pooters as \"warm, living, breathing, futile, half-baked, incredibly alive and endearing boneheads\".\n\nThe novelist Evelyn Waugh had been familiar with the \"Diary\" since his childhood. It was a great favourite of his parents—Arthur Waugh used to read passages aloud to his family, and Evelyn's biographer Selena Hastings has drawn attention to the distinctly Pooterish elements in the Waugh household. Evelyn Waugh was initially contemptuous of the book, but grew to admire it, to the extent of writing in his 1930 essay \"One Way to Immortality\" that it was \"the funniest book in the world\". He added: \"Nobody wants to read other people's reflections on life and religion and politics, but the routine of their day, properly recorded, is always interesting, and will become more so as conditions change with the years\". Morton posits that several of the leading characters in Waugh's early novels, though socially far removed from the Pooters, share the bafflement of Charles and Carrie with the problems of a changing world. In his 1945 novel \"Brideshead Revisited\", Waugh has Lady Marchmain comforting her family by reading aloud from the \"Diary\" \"with her beautiful voice and great humour of expression\". Morton suggests that one of the work's attractions to Waugh was his personal identification with Lupin, and the way in which the disapproved son (as Waugh saw himself) repeatedly manages to turn adverse circumstances to his ultimate advantage.\n\nAt about the time that Waugh was discovering his affection for the \"Diary\" another writer, J. B. Priestley, was extolling it as an exemplar of English humour; Jerome K. Jerome, Priestley asserted, never wrote anything as good: \"[P]oor Mr Pooter, with his simplicity, his timidity, his goodness of heart, is not simply a figure of fun but one of those innocent, lovable fools who are dear to the heart\". In a 1943 essay, George Orwell considered the book an accurate account of English life in the 1880s. In describing Pooter he revived the Don Quixote analogy but saw this English equivalent as a sentimentalised version of the original, one who \"constantly suffers disasters brought upon him by his own folly\". In the years after the Second World War the book's stock remained high; Osbert Lancaster deemed it \"a great work of art\", and similar enthusiasm was expressed by a new generation of writers and social historians. Gillian Tindall, writing in 1970, thought the \"Diary\" \"the best comic novel in the language\", and lauded Pooter as \"the presiding shade\" of his era. This accolade was echoed a further generation on by A. N. Wilson, who wrote in his study of the Victorian era: \"Who is to say that Oscar Wilde and Aubrey Beardsley are more typical of the [1890s] than the lower-middle class Charles and Carrie Pooter?\" Wilson also observed the extent to which the Pooters had become recognised as \"arbiters of the greatest good taste\", as the late 20th-century English middle classes sought to acquire or preserve authentic Victorian features in their carefully crafted \"period\" homes. A \"Spectator\" article of 2008 remarks on how such houses as \"The Laurels\", the humble habitats of 1890s City clerks, had by the 21st century become desirable £1 million-plus homes in what it terms \"banker land\".\n\nPeter Bailey, in his study \"White Collars, Gray Lives\" (1999), traces the beginnings of literary interest in the lower-middle classes to the \"disquieting irruption of a new breed of petty bourgeois shop and office workers\" that faced Victorian writers in the last quarter of the 19th century. The Grossmiths' \"Diary\" was a typical satire of its time; it probed the lower-middle class lives of the Pooters and poked fun at their pretensions and petty concerns. Tony Joseph calls the \"Diary\" \"a sharp analysis of social insecurity\". Although many writers had themselves come from humble backgrounds, they often sought to disguise their origins through scorn: \"putting the boot in on the lower middle classes\", says Bailey, \"has long been the intellectual's blood sport\". However, the quarter-century following the publication of \"The Diary of a Nobody\" saw a tendency to mix mockery with sympathy, even approval. In the works of writers such as George Gissing, H. G. Wells, Arnold Bennett and E. M. Forster, characters emerged who, despite the recognisably Pooterish aspects of their lives, were by no means entirely absurd. Bennett and Wells could poke fun at figures such as \"Denry Machin\", \"Mr Polly\" or \"Mr Lewisham\", while at the same time celebrating their fortitude, energy and determination to look for better things. In cases such as these, writes Bailey, \"disdain could change to admiration and national self-identification, as the Little Man ... was transposed into Everyman, a model of cheerful resilience in times of crisis.\"\n\nDuring the past century, the fictitious diary has developed as an accepted means of comedic expression; the original has, says Morton, \"been fertile ground which has germinated many seeds\". An early example is Anita Loos's novel of 1925: \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes: The Illuminating Diary of a Professional Lady\" in which the protagonist, Lorelei Lee, records her flirtatious adventure in prose that \"follows the mannerisms of colloquial speech\" and suggests innocence or ignorance yet, the critic Elyse Graham observes, \"burlesques, in excoriating detail, the vernacular of the American middle class\". The diary genre became particularly popular in the late 20th century. In 1978–81 Christopher Matthew produced three volumes of diaries recording the daily life of \"Simon Crisp\", a bachelor would-be man-about town of the era. The title of the first, \"The Diary of a Somebody\", is a direct reference to the Grossmith original. Reviewing this volume in \"The Spectator\", Benny Green points out several parallels with the original, in both character and event. Matthew's book, says Green, is amusing, but the Grossmiths' book is superior; it is \"affecting as well as comical, in a way that the Matthew pastiche is not\". In 1982 came the first appearance of Sue Townsend's teenage creation, Adrian Mole, whose passage into young manhood and early middle age is charted in a long series of diaries. The more middle-aged he becomes, says Morton, the more he resembles Pooter.\n\nKeith Waterhouse's \"Mrs Pooter's Diary\" of 1983 is an adaptation of the Grossmith original that shifts the narrative voice to Carrie Pooter. In 1996 Helen Fielding used the imaginary diary format for \"Bridget Jones's Diary\", which records the daily paraphernalia of a single woman's life. The \"New York Times\" critic wrote that it \"captures neatly the way modern women teeter between 'I am woman' independence and a pathetic girlie desire to be all things to all men.\" This diary began as a weekly column in \"The Independent\", and was later published in books which sold more than 15 million copies in 40 countries. In the 1990s the satirical magazine \"Private Eye\" lampooned John Major, British prime minister 1990–97, in \"The Secret Diary of John Major aged 47\", a hybrid of the Adrian Mole diaries with \"The Diary of a Nobody\", which made much fun of Major's lower-middle class origins.\n\nThe social historian James Hammerton defines \"Pooterism\" as \"the dependent weakness and inflated social pretension of white-collar workers, constructed in the workplace but expressed just as powerfully at home\". Jon Wilde of \"The Guardian\" observes this characteristic in a number of British TV comedy creations of the late 20th and early 21st centuries: Captain Mainwaring, Victor Meldrew, and \"Peep Show\"s Mark Corrigan are all examples of characters \"whose blinkered view of themselves is forever in sharp contrast to how they are perceived by the world\". Charles Pooter, says Hammerton, was a metaphor for lower middle-class pretension, pomposity and self-importance, set up for mockery by the \"elites\". However, by the mid-20th century changes in the perception of masculine roles in lower middle-class society had stifled the mockery, as men increasingly embraced domesticity. Hammerton remarks that the Grossmiths \"would surely appreciate the irony in seeing features of the lower middle-class existence they mocked so mercilessly becoming the more universal model for 20th century family life\". Bailey remarks on how the poet John Betjeman presented the Pooters \"not as objects of ridicule but of envy, snug and secure in their suburban retreat\".\n\nIn September 1954 a stage version of the \"Diary\", by Basil Dean and Richard Blake, was presented at London's Arts Theatre with a cast that included George Benson and Dulcie Gray as the Pooters and Leslie Phillips as Lupin. Anthony Hartley, writing in \"The Spectator\", classed this production as \"fair-to-middling\", with sympathetic performances from the principals: \"[I]t is a precondition of this kind of play that everybody concerned should have a heart of gold: only in the case of Mr. Pooter's employer, Mr. Perkupp, do we actually hear the metal chinking.\" \n\nIn 1986 Waterhouse presented an adaptation of his \"Mrs Pooter\" text at the Garrick Theatre, with Judi Dench and Michael Williams. This version was revived in 1993 at the Greenwich Theatre in a production by Matthew Francis. Clive Swift and Patricia Routledge played Charles and Carrie, in what Paul Taylor in \"The Independent\" described as \"essentially a two-hander ... in which all the other folk (including Lupin Pooter, the uppish, worrying son) are either imagined characters or, at times, impersonated by the Pooters\". \n\nIn March 2011 the \"Diary\" was the subject of an even less orthodox production at the Royal & Derngate Theatre, Northampton. Adapted by Hugh Osborne, with an all-male cast led by Robert Daws, this supposes that Pooter has arranged for his diaries to be performed by amateur actors. Quentin Letts of the \"Daily Mail\" found this \"an evening of some of the cleverest, fastest entertainment I have seen for months\". Lyn Gardner in \"The Guardian\" found it \"a show of some charm – though one that, like Pooter himself, does not quite have the credentials to be quite so pleased with itself\". \nIn 2014 a production of the \"Diary\" was staged in London by Rough Haired Pointer at the White Bear Theatre and later transferred to the King's Head Theatre. This production was revived at the King's |head in 2017; Time Out said of it: \"It captures the original’s sharp subtext, frivolous wit and heavy irony, while also being very, very silly\". \n\nThe first adaptation for screen was Ken Russell's short (40 minutes) film for the BBC film unit in 1964. Russell shot this in the style of the silent films of Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin, with the text narrated in a voice-over. The BBC screened two subsequent adaptations: in 1979 a version dramatised by Basil Boothroyd, and in 2007 a four-part dramatisation Andrew Davies, directed by Susanna White and first shown on BBC Four as part of the channel's Edwardian season. \"The Guardian\"s critic wrote of the latter that Hugh Bonneville was \"immaculate as the ignored kerfuffler [Pooter].\"\n\nBBC Radio 4 (sound radio) has broadcast several dramatisations of the \"Diary\". These include Stephen Tompkinson and Annette Badland in a 2004 adaptation by Kelvin Segger, and Johnny Vegas and Katherine Parkinson in Andrew Lynch's 2012 adaptation. In March 2015, BBC Radio 4 Extra broadcast an audio version of the 1986 Keith Waterhouse adaptation, starring Judi Dench and Michael Williams.\n\nNotes\nCitations\nBibliography\n\n"}

It follows two children named Billy—a slow-witted happy-go-lucky boy—and Mandy—his dark and cynical best friend—who, after winning a limbo game to save Billy's pet hamster, gain the mighty Grim Reaper as their best friend in eternal servitude and slavery.\n\n\"Billy & Mandy\" began as a series of segments on \"Grim & Evil\", from which it was spun-off, along with \"Evil Con Carne\", on August 24, 2001. The show ran as a separate series from June 13, 2003 to November 9, 2007, but a telefilm, titled \"\", aired on October 12, 2008, officially bringing the series to a close. In addition to the episodes, three movies, two special episodes, and nineteen shorts were made, with 3 award wins for the series as a whole. \"Billy & Mandy\" has also been made into a video game as well as various licensed merchandise. Reruns can currently be seen on Boomerang.\n\nThe series is centered around the exploits of Billy (voiced by Richard Steven Horvitz), a completely idiotic and happy-go-lucky boy; Mandy (Grey DeLisle), a cynical and merciless girl, and Grim (Greg Eagles), the Grim Reaper who is often tormented by the duo. After cheating at a limbo match against Grim (in retaliation for putting the limbo rod too low for them to go under), he is enslaved in a permanently unwanted friendship with the children. Grim is miserable in the first days of his servitude, and even fantasizes about killing them multiple times. However, as the time passes, he gradually adapts to the new life, and even grows to care for Billy and Mandy, if only somewhat. Despite this, he retains a love-hate relationship with the two and desires to eventually break free from his servitude.\n\nBilly and Mandy use Grim's supernatural abilities and powers to venture into supernatural locations or environments, such as the Underworld, or the Netherworld, inhabited by an assortment of grotesque monstrous beasts. The pair also use Grim's enormously strong supernatural abilities or ties with a number of beastly characters to achieve goals or desires for themselves, often with twisted results. Famed fictional monsters including Dracula, the Wolfman, and the bogeyman are also comically depicted in the series.\n\nSupporting characters include Irwin (Vanessa Marshall), a nerdy awkward boy who has a crush on Mandy; Harold (Richard Steven Horvitz), Billy's father who is even dumber than his son; Gladys (Jennifer Hale), Billy's loving yet mentally unstable mother; Mindy (Rachael MacFarlane), the snobby, stuck-up, and spoiled queen bee of Billy and Mandy's school; Sperg (Greg Eagles), the local bully who has a sensitive side; Fred Fredburger (C.H. Greenblatt), a simple-minded, irritating underworld creature who loves frozen yogurt and nachos; Dracula (Phil LaMarr), a selfish elderly vampire who's revealed to be Irwin's paternal grandfather in the final season of the show.\n\nThe show lacks continuity for the most part, as many episodes end with characters killed, exiled, or stuck in a situation. Characters sometimes display an awareness of some events from previous episodes, but there are no clear character arcs or coherent plot lines tying the show together.\n\nThe series had its genesis in 1995, when Maxwell Atoms, while he was a junior at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, made a two-minute short film for his thesis project. Titled \"Billy and Mandy in: The Trepanation of the Skull and You\", it centers around Billy and Mandy (prototype versions) discussing trepanning with each other. In the end, Mandy drills Billy's head, causing him to pass out after too much blood loss even though he says he feels great. The short had never been shown publicly until April 30, 2016, during the first annual TromAnimation Film Festival. After the screening, Atoms uploaded the film, albeit in a deteriorating state after years of storage, on his YouTube channel.\n\nThe show's existence is the result of a viewer poll event by way of telephone and the Internet called \"Cartoon Network's Big Pick\" which was held from June 16 to August 25, 2000. The three final choices were \"Grim and Evil\" (later splitting into two separate series: \"The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy\" and \"Evil Con Carne\"), \"Whatever Happened to... Robot Jones?\" and \"Longhair and Doubledome\". Out of the three, \"Grim and Evil\" attained the most votes with 57%; \"Robot Jones\" came in second place at 23% while \"Longhair and Doubledome\" received 20% of the vote.\n\nOriginally part of \"Grim & Evil\", \"Billy & Mandy\" served as the main show. In each episode, an \"Evil Con Carne\" short was put between two \"Grim\" shorts. On occasion, it was the other way around, with two \"Evil\" shorts and one \"Grim\" short. The series premiered on August 24, 2001, during the \"Cartoon Cartoon Fridays Big Pick Weekend\".\n\nOn June 13, 2003, the network separated the two segments and gave each their own full-length program. The short-lived \"Evil Con Carne\" show was cancelled once the already-produced season had aired. Some characters from \"Evil Con Carne\" occasionally appeared on \"The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy\". General Skarr become an official character on the show in the episode \"Skarred for Life\", where he becomes Billy's new next-door neighbor, and in \"Company Halt\", the ninth episode of the final season which functions as the true series finale for \"Evil Con Carne\", Ghastly, Hector, Boskov, and Stomach restart their evil organization and convince Skarr to join them, but their plans are ultimately foiled by Billy and Mandy, and Skarr goes back to living his life as a normal person.\n\n\"The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy\" received critical acclaim and became one of Cartoon Network's top rated and most popular series. Common Sense Media gave the show a 3/5 star rating and stated that it has \"goofy punchlines and obscure cultural references\", and recommends the viewer age be at least 8 years old. The series has won one Annie Award, two Emmy Awards and including those three wins, has been nominated a total of nine times for various awards. New episodes were broadcast on Cartoon Network Fridays at 7:30pm to over 1 million viewers an episode.\n\nThree TV movies were made for the series. The first one was called \"Billy & Mandy's Big Boogey Adventure\" and was released on DVD in April, 2007. Common Sense Media gave the movie 2/5 stars and is meant for kids over the age of 8 calling it \"undeniably gross and just as undeniably funny\". DVDverdict.com gave the movie a good review as well.\n\nA second movie, \"Wrath of the Spider Queen\", was also released in 2007. It was based on a spider queen from Grim's distant past, who tries to take revenge on him because she was meant to be the reaper. Meanwhile, keeping up with the spider theme, Billy learns to love his spider son Jeff.\n\nOn October 12, 2008, a third and final spin-off movie, titled \"Underfist: Halloween Bash\", premiered. The movie's primary focus is on Irwin, Jeff the Spider, Hoss Delgado, General Skarr, and Fred Fredburger accidentally coming together to defeat an invasion of chocolate bar monsters, led by an evil marshmallow bunny, on Halloween night.\n\nThe score composers for the series are Gregory Hinde, Drew Neumann and Guy Moon. In addition, two songs were made for the show by Aurelio Voltaire, the episode \"Little Rock of Horrors\", which parodies the musical \"Little Shop of Horrors\", features a song titled \"BRAINS!\" and, in \"Billy & Mandy's Big Boogey Adventure\", the song \"Land of the Dead\" is played in the opening credits. Both songs are a part of the album \"Spooky Songs For Creepy Kids\". The season two episode \"Battle of the Bands\" also featured the song \"Darkness\" by metal band SPF 1000. There was also an instance at the end of the Christmas special entitled \"Billy & Mandy Save Christmas\", where the end credits music is the song \"Round and Round\" by heavy metal band Ratt.\n\nA video game inspired by the series was developed by Midway Games, and released on October 2, 2006. It is a 3D fighting game. The video game received fair to good reviews: GameSpot gave it a 6.6/10 by Greg Mueller, he goes on to say that while it is fun for the \"first few hours\" and has \"Fast-paced gameplay\" the game action \"gets old quickly\" and has a very short story mode. IGN gave the game a good score of 7.2/10 highlighting its presentation and appeal. Metacritic gave the game a rating of 61/100 based on 10 critic reviews.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "43066454", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43066454", "title": "The Multiversity", "text": "The Multiversity\n\nThe Multiversity is a limited series of interrelated one-shots set in the DC Multiverse in The New 52, a collection of universes seen in publications by DC Comics. The one-shots in the series were written by Grant Morrison, each with a different artist. \"The Multiversity\" began in August 2014 and ran until April 2015.\n\nIn the conclusion to the 1985 comic book crossover \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", the DC Multiverse collapsed, merging the history of five universes into one single new universe. In the 1998–1999 series \"The Kingdom\", author Mark Waid and co-creator Grant Morrison introduced the concept of Hypertime, a super-dimensional construct that allowed for all publications to be canon or in-continuity somewhere. Hypertime, although infrequently used, was a replacement and explanation for the multiple timelines and histories DC had published through the years.\n\nIn the 2005–06 crossover \"Infinite Crisis\", the survivors of the first Crisis—Alexander Luthor, Jr. from Earth-Three, Superboy-Prime from Earth-Prime, and Kal-L of Earth-Two—had attempted to create a perfect world to replace the current DC Universe (DCU), with Luthor restoring, merging, and destroying worlds that had once existed in the Multiverse or were featured in Elseworlds publications. Luthor failed, due to the intervention of the universe's heroes, and inadvertently altered the history of the DC Universe. Prior to the publication of \"Infinite Crisis\", editor Dan DiDio revealed that Hypertime no longer exists in the DCU.\n\nFollowing \"Infinite Crisis\", the year-long weekly maxi-series \"52\" (2006–2007) led to the revelation that Multiverse still exists, in the form of 52 alternate universes. Author Grant Morrison stated that the return of the Multiverse was intended to launch new franchises, explaining:\nIn 2007–08, the weekly series \"Countdown\" (\"Countdown to Final Crisis\") was published as a follow up to \"52\" and lead-in to DC's next line-wide crossover \"Final Crisis\", along with various spin-off titles featuring the new Multiverse. The Multiverse plays a large part in the \"Final Crisis\" (2008–2009) series, where a team of Supermen from across the Multiverse assemble to defeat a rogue Monitor, Mandrakk. The series introduced Calvin Ellis, a new Superman from Earth-23 who is the President of the United States. Grant Morrison based the character on Barack Obama. The character would later appear in Grant Morrison's \"Action Comics\" #9 (July 2012) and was a central character in \"The Multiversity\". \"Final Crisis\" was described by editor Dan DiDio as the finale in a trilogy of stories about the Multiverse, describing each Crisis: \"The death of the Multiverse, the rebirth of the Multiverse, and now the ultimate story of the multiverse.\"\n\nWhen asked about his future role in expanding the Multiverse following \"Final Crisis\", Morrison stated: \"I'm in the early stages of putting together material for a Multiverse series but I want to spend a lot of time getting it exactly right, so there are currently no deadlines and I don't anticipate any of this coming out until 2010.\" Morrison later revealed that he had been working on a new book set on Earth-4, featuring Charlton Comics characters, but inspired by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons's 1986 limited series \"Watchmen\", which in turn was proposed initially as being based on Charlton Comics characters.\n\nIn \"Wizard\" #212 (April 2009), Morrison detailed his project, \"The Multiversity\", intended for publication in 2010. Morrison states that the series: \"will pick up a bunch of strands from \"52\" and \"Final Crisis\".\" He noted that his work would include a one-shot for each of seven different universes, where they: \"all link together as a seven-issue story that re-imagines the relationship between the DCU and the Multiverse.\"\n\nMorrison provided Jeffrey Renaud of Comic Book Resources with further details, explaining the reasoning behind the project: \"The idea was to do seven books that would be #1 issues for seven different teams on seven different Earths. Each of these would be the bible for what could potentially be an entire comic line for each of these Earths.\" Originally, his co-writers (Geoff Johns, Mark Waid, and Greg Rucka) on \"52\" were to have participated in the project.\n\nIn 2010, it was revealed that Morrison's frequent collaborators Cameron Stewart and Frank Quitely were, at the time, the only artists chosen for \"The Multiversity\". Quitely would illustrate \"Pax Americana\", featuring Morrison's reworking of the Charlton characters, based on Earth-4. Stewart's one-shot would be \"Thunderworld\", focusing on Captain Marvel of Earth-5. Artist Frazer Irving stated that Morrison \"reserved a small part of my soul\" to do work on \"The Multiversity\".\n\nIn 2011, DC Comics announced that its entire line of publications would be cancelled following \"Flashpoint\" (2011), leading into a rebooted DC Universe known as The New 52. The finale of \"Flashpoint\" #5 (September 2011) saw three distinct universes from the Multiverse—WildStorm Universe, Vertigo, and the DC Universe—merge into one universe, designated \"Prime Earth\". Dan DiDio clarified that there is still a Multiverse, but gave no details on how it has changed and suggested \"The Multiversity\" might provide answers. Morrison later revealed that \"The Multiversity\" would not be out until 2012, noting that Quitely had just begun working on his issue. Morrison also gave a definitive length for the series, 9 one-shots, where two are book-ends with the other 7 each focusing on a different universe. Tonally, Morrison has described \"The Multiversity\" as feeling similar to his work on \"Seven Soldiers\" (2005).\n\nIn September 2012, as part of MorrisonCon, DC Entertainment officially confirmed \"The Multiversity\", giving the series a publication date of late 2013. It was also revealed that the series would feature 8 one-shots, each issue being 38 pages plus an 8-page backup. Morrison also confirmed that \"The Multiversity\" had not been affected by anything in The New 52, but would still feature a \"little sort of wave over to the DC Universe,\" and that The New 52 fits \"really nicely into the scheme without doing any damage.\"\n\nIn February 2013, Morrison stated that he had created a guidebook for DC's Multiverse, incorporating all 52 alternate universes, which other authors reference when working with the multiverse concept. The guidebook was included as the sixth installment of \"The Multiversity\" and was published in January 2015; it contained maps and blueprints to the Multiverse as well as brief descriptions of the meta-humans that populate forty-five out of its fifty-two alternate Earths (with details about Earths 14, 24, 25, 27, 28, 46 and 49 omitted).\n\nIn April 2014, \"The Multiversity\" was announced for publication in August 2014. The announcement also revealed more of the series' artists including Chris Sprouse, Karl Story, Ben Oliver, Frank Quitely, Cameron Stewart, Ivan Reis, and Joe Prado. In May 2014, the first issue, by artists Ivan Reis and Joe Prado, was officially solicited by DC Comics. Each subsequent one-shot was published monthly.\n\nIn July 2014, during San Diego Comic-Con International, DC Comics held a panel titled \"The Multiversity Enrollment\", featuring creators Grant Morrison and Cameron Stewart with editor Eddie Berganza. Posters, featuring a map of the Multiverse, designed by Morrison and Rian Hughes, were handed out to attendees of the panel. DC later included a version of the map as a \"Channel 52\" exclusive at the end of books published in the week of July 28, 2014.\n\nIn May 2015, a director's cut of the \"Pax American\" one-shot was published.\n\n\"The Multiversity\" featured a story arc about the DC Comics multiverse being invaded by a race of cosmic parasites known as the Gentry. The Gentry come from beyond the immediate DC \"local\" multiverse, and each member is a cultural fear or \"bad idea\" personified as a living, demonic entity. Intellectron is the immoral genius; Demogorgunn is the mindless, sprawling horde; Hellmachine is unchecked, uncontrollable technology; Dame Merciless is the ultimate extreme of the Femme Fatale; and Lord Broken is insanity and despair.\n\nThe Gentry were drawn to the multiverse by the emanations of ruined dreams and negative ideas. They want to seize ownership of every single mind in existence, and in doing so, control all thoughts and stories. To this end, they use \"Ultra Comics #1\" as a vector to infect the multiverse, and they simultaneously launch an attack on every earth in the Orrery of Worlds.\n\nVarious heroes from across different universes are forced to band together to face this extra-dimensional threat, initiating the \"Battle for All Creation.\"\n\nThe series contained nine issues and consisted of six one-shots, a guidebook containing a map of the multiverse and entries describing each Earth, and a two-part story serving as a prologue and conclusion—which Morrison described as an: \"80-page giant DC super-spectacular story.\" Each one-shot took place in a different universe, and each publication featured different trade dress and a different storytelling approach. Morrison explains: \"each comic looks like it comes from a different parallel world, so they're all slightly different.\"\n\nMorrison stated that when developing the series, he had to think of a way for the featured universes to communicate with each other. He recalled the \"Flash of Two Worlds\" storyline from \"The Flash\" #123, where the adventures of the Golden Age Flash (Jay Garrick of Earth-2) were documented as a comic book on Earth-1. He incorporated this device into \"The Multiversity\", stating \"they're reading each other's adventures, so there's some way that if a real big emergency arises, they can communicate using comic books. So each world has a comic from the previous world which has clues to the disaster that's coming their way, and they all have to basically start communicating using writers and artists so it's my big, big statement.\" Morrison further explained how the device was used to create a cohesive story: \"[I]t's almost like a baton race or a relay race where each of the worlds can read a comic book that's published in their world but which tells the adventures of the previous world. The characters are actually reading the series along with the readers.\"\n\nThe first chapter, illustrated by Ivan Reis, Joe Prado, and Nei Ruffino, \"The Multiversity\" featured Calvin Ellis, President of the United States and Superman of Earth-23. Morrison described \"The Multiversity\" as a big team book, featuring characters from all over the Multiverse, the team looked: \"after the welfare of the entire multiverse and they're headquartered in a place called the Multiversity.\" Morrison compared the team to a Justice League of the Multiverse. The team includes characters such as Captain Carrot as well as Thunderer, an Aboriginal version of Marvel Comics' Thor. It was published in August 2014.\n\nThe second chapter, illustrated by Chris Sprouse and Karl Story, \"The Society of Super-Heroes: Conquerors of the Counter-World\" (\"SOS\") featured the Society of Super-Heroes from Earth-20 and their villainous counterparts from Earth-40. The Society of Superheroes is a pulp-style Justice Society of America, led by Doc Fate, who had previously appeared in \"Superman Beyond\". Morrison describes him as: \"kind of a Doc Savage-come-Doctor Fate guy who teams with the Mighty Atom, the Immortal Man, Lady Blackhawk and her Blackhawks, and Abin Sur, the Green Lantern. It's all kind of a 1940s retro thing. As I say, it's a pulp take on superheroes,\" along with other recreated \"primitive pulp characters\". Morrison described this Earth as having a population of only \"two billion people, even though it's 2012.\" There has been a recent global war akin to World War II, albeit directed against a scion of the al-Ghul dynasty, and an alliance of Arab/Islamic states, the \"Desert Crescent\". Earth-40 invaders devastate Earth-20 as its super villains wage global war against the Society of Super Heroes in defense of their home alternate. It was published in September 2014.\n\nThe third chapter, illustrated by Ben Oliver, \"The Just\" features a world of legacy characters and children of superheroes from Earth-16, such as Connor Hawke and the Super-Sons. \"This is those guys but they're not the main heroes. There's a whole younger generation of heroes—kind of media brats almost.\" Morrison describes them as \"children of superheroes—a son of Superman, a son of Batman, et cetera—who exist in a world where they have incredible abilities, but the previous generation had ushered in a utopia, so they don't really have any notion of where to direct it, and they're very unhappy with the world as is.\" Morrison cites MTV's \"The Hills\" as his inspiration for \"The Just\". Morrison described the idea as: \"What happens when your mom and dad fix everything? Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman have kind of fixed everything so the kids have nothing to do\", instead resorting to battle reenactments, \"these kids, they dress up but they've never fought anything.\" Morrison had originally conceptualized a \"Super-Sons\" story as part of his \"All-Star Superman\" series, where Superman and Batman had stopped all crime, noting that \"[o]ne day, I might get to them or some version of it. There's a little bit of that in the \"Multiversity\" series that I'm doing\". Morrison originally designated this universe as Earth-11. The one-shot was published in October 2014. Dame Merciless is the Gentry member who is assigned to this world, working confusion and disorientation into the lives of Kyle Rayner/Green Lantern, Alexis Luthor and Offspring, appearing in an artwork by Kon-El/Superboy.\n\nThe fourth chapter, illustrated by Frank Quitely, \"Pax Americana: In Which We Burn\" takes place on Earth-4 and features characters from Charlton Comics. It has been described by Morrison as: \"if Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons had pitched the \"Watchmen\" now, rooted in a contemporary political landscape.\" Rather than the Cold War focus of \"Watchmen\", the title's focus is on international terrorism and conspiracy in a world of superheroes. The story is told with an 8-panel grid, similar to \"Watchmen\"s 9-panel grid layout. The story is based around musical harmonics, as each world in the Multiverse vibrates at a different frequency, with Quitely explaining: \"music, and vibration… musical vibrations, the octave, the eight as a repeated motive, and creating patterns leading the eye around the page in a specific way.\" Morrison describes \"Pax Americana\" as his \"Citizen Kane\". The Captain Atom of this universe had been introduced in \"Final Crisis\" as his world's analogue to Superman. Morrison describes The Question as: \"a little bit like Rorschach but absolutely nothing like Rorschach.\" Peacemaker is described as a good guy, but assassinates the President of the United States. The story revolves around the assassination and the failures on part of the Charlton characters. The one-shot was published in November 2014.\n\nThe fifth chapter, illustrated by Cameron Stewart, \"Thunderworld Adventures\" takes place on Earth-5 and features characters from the Captain Marvel family. Morrison described this book as: \"a classic Shazam book but it's done in a way almost like a Pixar movie or the way we did \"All Star Superman\". It captures the spirit of those characters without being nostalgic or out of date.\" Morrison called it his \"attempt to see if you can get the pure note of Captain Marvel, with no irony and no camp and just make it work for everyone. It's like a myth, a little folk tale. It's pure.\" The one-shot was published in December 2014.\n\nIn this chapter, Doctor Sivana reads a copy of \"The Society of Super-Heroes: Conquerors of the Counter-World\", and the comic book inspires him to recruit an army of alternate versions of himself from across the multiverse. Sivana and the Legion of Sivanas pool their resources to develop synthetic, crystallized time called Suspendium, and they use their invention to create an eighth day of the calendar week called Sivanaday. Sivana then pilots a gigantic, technological copy of the Rock of Eternity into the heart of the Multiverse and captures the wizard Shazam.\n\nSivana's machinations result in time distortions all over Fawcett City. While reporting for WHIZ Media, Billy Batson sees a vision of himself from the future, warning his past self to keep careful track of time. Billy is suddenly attacked by Doctor Sivana's children: Magnificus, Thaddeus Sivana Jr., and Georgia, all of whom have been given superpowers to rival the Marvel Family. Billy transforms into Captain Marvel and battles the Sivanas and the Monster Society of Evil with assistance from Mary Marvel, Captain Marvel Jr., the Lieutenant Marvels, and Mister Tawky Tawny.\n\nCaptain Marvel journeys through the Multiverse to the Rock of Eternity to put a stop to Sivana's scheme. He discovers that Sivana has stolen the secret of Shazam's magic lightning, and Sivana becomes a hulking, musclebound brute called Black Sivana. Black Sivana appears to be winning the fight, but Captain Marvel transforms back into Billy Batson and uses the Suspendium crystals to transmit a message back through time. The meaning of the message is revealed: each member of the Legion of Sivanas stole Suspendium from the group, depriving Sivanaday the full twenty-four hours to last a complete day. Sivanaday runs out of time and Sivana loses his powers. Having saved the day, Captain Marvel and the Marvel Family fly off to the next big adventure.\n\nThe sixth chapter, illustrated by various artists, featured the \"Multiversity Guidebook\", consisting of detailed entries on all 52 Earths, a map showcasing \"all known existence\", and a history of the \"Crisis\" events. The one-shot was published in 80-Page Giant format in January 2015.\n\nIn this chapter, the Little League of the Chibi Earth-42 is attacked by the Legion of Sivanas. The Batman of Earth-42 must team up with the displaced Batman of post-apocalyptic Earth-17 to escape from the Sivanas' army of killer robots. While the Batmen attempt to activate the device used by the Sivanas for crossing from earth to earth, the Batman of Earth-42 learns about events transpiring on Earth-51 by reading about them in the \"Multiversity Guidebook\" comic, where they appear as fictional characters.\n\nOn Earth-51, Kamandi, Prince Tuftan, and Ben Boxer investigate a mysterious tomb on the Island of the God-Watchers. They are observed from afar by New Gods of Supertown, who identify the tomb as the place where Darkseid was caged and contained. It is revealed by the New Gods of Earth-51 that they can exist across the multiverse as \"emanations.\" It is also revealed that Darkseid has been freed from his tomb by Nix Uotan – unleashed to assume new forms and spread evil across all reality.\n\nThe Batman of Earth-17 escapes to the House of Heroes with the\" Multiversity Guidebook\", only to arrive just as Gentry member Hellmachine launches an all-out assault. The slain members of the Little League return to life, commanded to live and die over and over again by the unseen master of the Gentry: the all-powerful \"Empty Hand.\"\n\nThe seventh chapter, illustrated by Jim Lee and Scott Williams, \"Mastermen\", takes place on Earth-10, and features characters from Quality Comics as part of the Freedom Fighters and Nazi versions of various heroes. The concept is borrowed from Earth-X, a universe where Nazi Germany won World War II, featured in stories before \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\". Morrison describes this one-shot as a \"big, dark Shakespearean story.\" The members of this world's Freedom Fighters include a Jewish Phantom Lady, a homosexual Ray, and an African Black Condor, with other members also being representative of groups targeted by the Nazis, such as Doll Man and Doll Woman, who are Jehovah's Witnesses. Overman, the Superman of this world, landed on Earth in 1939 in Nazi territory and was raised by Adolf Hitler. The story is set around a utopia built by this world's Superman after he realizes the evil nature of Hitler; this Superman \"knows his entire society, though it looks utopian, was built on the bones of the dead. Ultimately it's wrong and it must be destroyed.\" The one-shot was published in February 2015.\n\nIn this chapter, Kal-L landed in the contested Sudetenland in 1939 and his ship was discovered by the Nazis. Kal-L is dubbed Overman by Adolph Hitler and is raised to be a living super-weapon and a symbol of Nazi supremacy. In April 1956, Overman presided over the fall of the United States amidst the devastation of Washington, D.C. Sixty years later, in 2016, Overman is a member of the New Reichsmen, his world's version of the Justice League, which consists of the Valkyrie Brunnhilde (an alternate Wonder Woman), Underwaterman (an alternate Aquaman), Leatherwing (an alternate Batman whose grandfather was Hans von Hammer, the protagonist of Enemy Ace), Blitzen/Lightning (an alternate version of the Flash, who is a female speedster), the Martian (an alternate Martian Manhunter), and unnamed alternate versions of Green Lantern and Red Tornado. The world is a technologically advanced utopia, built on the genocide of millions. The guilt-ridden Overman is haunted by the death of his cloned sister, Overgirl, and has recurring nightmares of a towering, ruined house – Lord Broken of the Gentry.\n\nAfter the Human Bomb attacks an Overgirl memorial in Metropolis, Overman and the Reichsmen attempt to uncover the truth behind a new terrorist organization called the Freedom Fighters and their leader, the mysterious figure known only as \"Uncle Sam.\" Uncle Sam warns of a terrible revenge for the Nazi atrocities of the past, and the Reichsmen suspect that they have a traitor on the team. Overman has growing doubt about his cause, but prepares to attend a performance of Wagner's \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\" with his wife, Lena.\n\nUncle Sam carries out his master plan, and the Human Bomb detonates on board the Reichsmen's orbiting satellite base. The damaged satellite falls to earth, and Overman is unable to stop it from crashing into the city of Metropolis. Millions die and the city is utterly destroyed. Overman is the only survivor, left alone in a crater of ash. The destruction of Metropolis marks \"the beginning of the end\" of the Nazi empire.\n\nThe eighth chapter, illustrated by Doug Mahnke and Christian Alamy, \"Ultra Comics\" takes place on Earth-33, an alternate name for the real world. It features Ultraa, the first superhero of Earth-Prime. Morrison describes this book as: \"the most advanced thing I've ever done. I'm so excited about this. It's just taking something that used to be done in comics and captions that they don't do anymore and turning it into a technique, a weapon, but beyond that I don't want to say. It's a haunted comic book, actually, it's the most frightening thing anyone will ever read. It's actually haunted—if you read this thing, you'll become possessed.\" This one-shot was published in March 2015.\n\nThe eighth chapter concerns the creation of Ultra Comics: a synthetic, completely fictional comic book superhero created by \"memesmiths\" to battle and defeat a dangerous idea designated as a Hostile Independent Thought-Form. After exploring the ruins of a bizarre, post-apocalyptic New York City, Ultra Comics is betrayed and the HIT is revealed to be Intellectron of the Gentry. Collaborating with the Gentry are the \"Neighbourhood Guard\", a group of feral, cannibal children, and other versions of Ultra characters from the DC Multiverse, including Ultra-Man, Ultra the Multi-Alien and several others. The Ultras all serve Ultraa, consort of Maxima and joint ruler of her world Almerac. Ultra Comics is ultimately destroyed by Intellectron, but not before trapping it on the last page of the comic – effectively sealing it inside the end of the narrative. The final caption ominously warns the reader that their mind has become infected.\n\nThe ninth and final chapter, illustrated by Ivan Reis and Joe Prado, \"The Multiversity\" #2 features the final battle between the Gentry and the combined superheroes of the DC Comics Multiverse. The issue was published in April 2015.\n\nThe corrupted Nix Uotan opens doorways across the multiverse that allow the Gentry to complete their invasion, despite attacks from Aquawoman, Thunderer, President Superman, Captain Carrot, Red Racer, and the Retaliators of Earth-8. Ultimately, Nix Uotan is freed from Gentry control by the Red Racer, working in tandem with every speedster superhero in existence. Uotan reveals that he resisted the Gentry while under their control, and arranged for the same doorways that summoned the Gentry to summon the champions of the Multiverse. The Harbinger AI from the House of Heroes transmits a cosmic SOS across every Earth, calling on all superheroes everywhere to rise to the defense of their worlds.\n\nThe Gentry are defeated and driven back. A small group of superheroes pursue the Gentry to the ruined world of Earth-7, where they discover that the members of the Gentry that they fought were merely part of a vast legion of Gentries. The Gentries labor to complete a Multiverse-destroying doomsday weapon called the Oblivion Machine. They are watched over by their master – a shadowy, unknowable entity called as \"The Empty Hand.\" The Empty Hand informs the gathered heroes that its assessment of the Multiverse is finished, and it then effortlessly banishes the heroes from Earth-7.\n\nAt the House of Heroes, the assembled super-beings of the Multiverse vow to work together to protect their worlds from future threats to reality. Organized by President Superman of Earth-23, they form a pan-universal superteam called Justice Incarnate. The superheroes offer to reward Nix Uotan for his role in the rescue of multi-trillions of lives. At first, Nix Uotan declines, but then he remembers something and asks for a small favor. The story ends with Nix in his human form, waking from a dream. He now has the $800.00 he owes to his landlord, and he pays in full.\n\nThe series has been collected into a single volume:\n\n\nOn the future of the Multiverse, Morrison explained, \"each one of the episodes also sets up a potential series. You could do a Multiverse range of books out of this. All of them are designed to be issue one of potential long-running series as well as being self-contained. It's been a storytelling challenge, but the whole idea is to set stuff up for future development – not necessarily by me, but by DC in some way.\" At San Diego Comic-Con International 2015, Morrison announced a series of original graphic novels under the title \"Multiversity Too\". The series will continue to be written by Morrison, with the first entry, \"Multiversity Too: The Flash\" scheduled to debut in 2016. In December 2017, Morrison noted the project was on hold. He added, \"I felt there was a lot of great Flash material in comics and on TV so I left my take on the table for a while. I'll get to it eventually.\"\n"}
{"id": "1201980", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1201980", "title": "The Tholian Web", "text": "The Tholian Web\n\n\"The Tholian Web\" is the ninth episode of the of the original American science fiction television series \"\". It is episode #64, production #64, first broadcast on November 15, 1968, and repeated August 19, 1969. It was written by Judy Burns and Chet Richards and directed by Herb Wallerstein.\n\nIn the episode, Captain Kirk is caught between dimensions while the crew of the \"Enterprise\" works to retrieve him. All the while, the Tholians are weaving a destructive energy web around the \"Enterprise\" because Spock will not leave Tholian space without his Captain.\n\nThe Federation starship USS \"Enterprise\" enters an uncharted region of space while searching for her sister ship, the USS \"Defiant\", which has been missing for three weeks. Sensors detect what seem to be fractures in space, and an unexplained power loss affects all systems. The \"Defiant\" is found adrift, and Captain James T. Kirk, First Officer Spock, Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy, and Navigator Ensign Chekov transport across wearing environmental suits for protection. Aboard \"Defiant\", they find the entire crew dead, apparently having killed one another.\n\nThe boarding party discovers that the \"Defiant\" is slowly dissolving. At one point, McCoy is able to pass his hand through an almost invisible man and a table. With limited transporter functionality due to the unexplained malfunctions, Kirk orders his men to return to \"Enterprise\" first. The beaming takes much longer than usual, and as Chief Engineer Mr. Scott finally tries to beam Kirk aboard, the \"Defiant\" vanishes, taking the Captain with it.\n\nSpock determines that the local space is experiencing periods of \"interphase\", and believes that Kirk will reappear during the next one. As he explains the situation, Chekov lashes out in anger, a symptom that Dr. McCoy believes is due to their proximity to \"Defiant\". Spock, however, refuses to move the ship, fearful of disrupting local space, which would result in the loss of the Captain.\n\nWith two hours to go before the next interphase, the \"Enterprise\" is approached by a small, unfamiliar ship. Its captain, Commander Loskene of the Tholian Assembly, asserts that the \"Enterprise\" has violated Tholian space and must leave. Spock persuades him to wait one hour and fifty-three minutes. When the time is up, Kirk does not reappear, and Spock concludes that the Tholian ship has disrupted the interphase.\n\nWhen the \"Enterprise\" is attacked by Loskene, McCoy again urges Spock to leave, believing that Kirk is dead. Spock chooses to return fire and the Tholian ship is disabled, but the \"Enterprise\" takes damage as well. Scotty warns that because of the damage he cannot guarantee that he can hold their position. A second Tholian ship joins the first, and the two begin to weave a vast energy web that cages the \"Enterprise\". Spock determines that if the web is completed before repairs are done, they will be unable to escape.\n\nSpock conducts a memorial service for Kirk, during which another man becomes insane. Spock and McCoy then view a tape left by Kirk meant to be played in the event of his death, which asks the two of them to work together for the benefit of the ship. Lieutenant Uhura and Scott both report seeing ghostly manifestations of Kirk. Finally, this apparition is seen on the bridge; Kirk is still in his environmental suit and appears to be urging Spock to \"hurry\".\n\nWith the Tholian Web nearly complete, McCoy dispenses an antidote to the effects of the local space, and Spock determines the time of Kirk's next appearance. They successfully lock onto Kirk's coordinates, and Spock orders the activation of ship's power, which carries them through the spatial rift to a point 2.72 parsecs away. Kirk is brought along by the transporter lock, and he is beamed aboard just as his oxygen runs out.\n\nBack on the bridge, Kirk questions Spock and McCoy about their handling of the emergency, particularly concerning his final orders. Both claim that they had not had time to listen to them, and Kirk accepts that answer.\n\nIn a two-part episode of \"\" called \"In a Mirror, Darkly\", it is revealed that the \"Defiant\" has reappeared in the Mirror Universe of Archer's time, where it is first salvaged by the Tholians and then stolen by the Terran Empire. The \"Defiant\" bridge is recreated in precise detail, even to the positions of the dead crewmen.\n\nIn 1997 it became known that United States Customs investigators had used the name \"Tholian Web\" for a technique for embroiling child porn enthusiasts in internet conversations to trick them into illegal activity. \nBy 1997 it had triggered hundreds of prosecutions.\n\nIn 2010 Gerry W. Beyer, of the Texas Tech University School of Law, cited a video recording introduced in this episode, which Captain Kirk, Captain of the starship \"Enterprise\", had left for his two most senior officers to play in the event of his death, urging them to overcome their personal animosity.\nBeyer described this fictional recording as one of the first recorded instances of what he called a \"video-will\".\n\nPolitical scientists have compared the metaphor of the entrapment in this episode with the deep challenges politicians and administrators feel when confronted with competing factions and lobby groups.\n\n"}
{"id": "31222", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31222", "title": "Theoderic the Great", "text": "Theoderic the Great\n\nTheoderic the Great (454 – 30 August 526), often referred to as Theodoric (; , ', , , , ', , , ), was king of the Ostrogoths (475–526), ruler of Italy (493–526), regent of the Visigoths (511–526), and a patricius of the Roman Empire. As ruler of the combined Gothic realms, Theoderic controlled an empire stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Adriatic Sea. He kept good relations between Ostrogoths and Romans, maintained a Roman legal administration and oversaw a flourishing scholarly culture and the largest building program in Italy in 100 years.\n\nTheodoric was born in Pannonia in 454 as the son of king Theodemir, a Germanic Amali nobleman, and his concubine Ereleuva. From 461 to 471, Theoderic grew up as a hostage in Constantinople, received a privileged education under imperial direction, and succeeded his father as leader of the Pannonian Ostrogoths in 473. Settling his people in lower Moesia, Theoderic came into conflict with Thracian Ostrogoths led by Theodoric Strabo, whom he eventually supplanted, uniting the peoples in 484. Emperor Zeno subsequently gave him the title of Patrician, \"Vir gloriosus\", and the office of Magister militum (master of the soldiers), and even appointed him as consul. Seeking further gains, Theoderic frequently ravaged the provinces of the Eastern Roman Empire, eventually threatening Constantinople itself. In 488, Emperor Zeno ordered Theoderic to overthrow the Germanic \"foederatus\" and King of Italy, Odoacer. After a victorious four-year war, Theoderic killed Odoacer with his own hands while they shared a meal, settled his 200,000 to 250,000 people in Italy, and founded an Ostrogothic Kingdom based in Ravenna. Theoderic extended his hegemony over the Burgundian and Vandal Kingdoms through marriage alliances. In 511, the Visigothic Kingdom was brought under Theoderic's direct control, forming a Gothic empire that extended from the Atlantic Ocean to the Adriatic Sea.\n\nTheoderic's achievements began to unravel in his later years. The Burgundians and Vandals threw off Ostrogothic hegemony by 523, and Theoderic's presumptive heir to both Gothic realms and son-in-law Eutharic died in 522, throwing his succession into doubt. Theoderic's good relations with the Roman Senate deteriorated due to a presumed senatorial conspiracy in 522, and, in 523, Theoderic had the philosopher and court official Boethius and Boethius' father-in-law Symmachus executed on charges of treason related to the alleged plot. Theoderic died in Ravenna on 30 August 526, and was succeeded by his grandson Athalaric, with Theoderic's daughter Amalasuntha serving as regent. The Visigothic Kingdom re-acquired its independence on Theoderic's death.\n\nSeeking to restore the glory of Ancient Rome, he ruled Italy in its most peaceful and prosperous period since Valentinian. Memories of his reign made him a hero of German legend as Dietrich von Bern.\n\nThe man who would later rule under the name of Theoderic was born in AD 454, on the banks of the Neusiedler See near Carnuntum. This was just a year after the Ostrogoths had thrown off nearly a century of domination by the Huns. His Gothic name, which is reconstructed by linguists as \"*Þiudareiks\", translates into \"people-king\" or \"ruler of the people\". The son of King Theodemir and Ereleuva, Theoderic went to Constantinople as a young boy, as a hostage to secure the Ostrogoths' compliance with a treaty Theodemir had concluded with the Byzantine Emperor Leo the Thracian (ruled 457–474).\n\nHe was Leo's hostage at the Great Palace of Constantinople from 461 to 471 and was well-educated by Constantinople's best teachers. Theodoric was treated with favor by the Emperors Leo I and Zeno (ruled 474–475 and 476–491). He settled his people in Epirus in 479 with the help of his relative Sidimund. Theodoric became \"magister militum\" (Master of Soldiers) in 483, and one year later he became consul in a ceremony in the presence of Emperor Zeno. Afterwards, he returned to live among the Ostrogoths when he was 31 years old and became their king in 488. The legend that he was illiterate arose from the fact that he used a stamp to affix his approval of laws; he no doubt spoke Latin and Greek and could read these languages although one cannot know how well.\n\nAt the time, the Ostrogoths were settled in Byzantine territory as \"foederati\" (allies) of the Romans, but were becoming restless and increasingly difficult for Zeno to manage. Not long after Theoderic became king, the two men worked out an arrangement beneficial to both sides. The Ostrogoths needed a place to live, and Zeno was having serious problems with Odoacer, the King of Italy who had come to power in 476. Ostensibly a viceroy for Zeno, Odoacer was menacing Byzantine territory and not respecting the rights of Roman citizens in Italy. At Zeno's encouragement, Theoderic invaded Odoacer's kingdom. In this endeavor he received the support of the Rugian king Frideric, who was the son of Theodoric's cousin Giso.\n\nTheoderic moved with his people towards Italy in the autumn of 488. On the way he was opposed by the Gepids, whom he defeated at Sirmium in August 489. Arriving in Italy, Theodoric won the battles of Isonzo and Verona in 489. He was defeated by Odoacer at Faenza in 490, but regained the upper hand after securing victory in the Battle of the Adda River on August 11, 490. In 493 he took Ravenna. On February 2, 493, Theoderic and Odoacer signed a treaty that assured both parties would rule over Italy. A banquet was organised on 15 March 493 in order to celebrate this treaty. It was at this banquet that Theoderic, after making a toast, killed Odoacer; Theoderic drew his sword and struck him on the collarbone.\n\nLike Odoacer, Theoderic was ostensibly only a viceroy for the emperor in Constantinople. In reality, he was able to avoid imperial supervision, and dealings between the emperor and Theoderic were as equals. Unlike Odoacer, however, Theoderic respected the agreement he had made and allowed Roman citizens within his kingdom to be subject to Roman law and the Roman judicial system. The Goths, meanwhile, lived under their own laws and customs. In 519, when a mob had burned down the synagogues of Ravenna, Theoderic ordered the town to rebuild them at its own expense.\n\nTheoderic the Great sought alliances with, or hegemony over, the other Germanic kingdoms in the west. He allied with the Franks by his marriage to Audofleda, sister of Clovis I, and married his own female relatives to princes or kings of the Visigoths, Vandals and Burgundians. He stopped the Vandals from raiding his territories by threatening the weak Vandal king Thrasamund with invasion, and sent a guard of 5,000 troops with his sister Amalafrida when she married Thrasamund in AD 500. For much of his reign, Theoderic was the \"de facto\" king of the Visigoths as well, becoming regent for the infant Visigothic king, his grandson Amalaric, following the defeat of Alaric II by the Franks under Clovis in 507. The Franks were able to wrest control of Aquitaine from the Visigoths, but otherwise Theoderic was able to defeat their incursions.\nTheoderic's achievements began to unravel even before his death. He had married off his daughter Amalasuntha to the Visigoth Eutharic, but Eutharic died in August 522 or 523, so no lasting dynastic connection of Ostrogoths and Visigoths was established. In 522, the Catholic Burgundian king Sigismund killed his own son, Theoderic's grandson, Sergeric. Theoderic retaliated by invading the Burgundian kingdom and then annexing its southern part, probably in 523. The rest was ruled by Sigismund's Arian brother Godomar, under Gothic protection against the Franks who had captured Sigismund. This brought the territory ruled by Theoderic to its height (see map), but in 523 or 524 the new Catholic Vandal king Hilderic imprisoned Amalafrida and killed her Gothic guard. Theoderic was planning an expedition to restore his power over the Vandal kingdom when he died in 526.\nTheoderic was married once.\n\nHe had a concubine in Moesia, name unknown, with whom he had two daughters:\n\nBy his marriage to Audofleda in 493 he had one daughter:\n\nAfter his death in Ravenna in 526, Theoderic was succeeded by his grandson Athalaric. Athalaric was at first represented by his mother Amalasuntha, who served as regent from 526 until 534. The kingdom of the Ostrogoths, however, began to wane and was conquered by Justinian I in 553 after the Battle of Mons Lactarius.\n\nTheoderic promoted the rebuilding of Roman cities and the preservation of ancient monuments in Italy. The fame of his building works reached far-away Syria. Theoderic's building program saw more extensive new construction and restoration than that of any of the Western Roman Emperors after Honorius (395–423).\n\nTheoderic devoted most of his architectural attention to his capital, Ravenna. He restored Ravenna's water supply by repairing an aqueduct originally built by Trajan. He proceeded to construct a \"Great Basilica of Hercules\" next to a colossal statue of Hercules. To promote Arianism, the king commissioned a small Arian cathedral, the \"Hagia Anastasis\", which contains the Arian Baptistery. Three more churches built by Theoderic in Ravenna and its suburbs, S. Andrea dei Goti, S. Giorgio and S. Eusebio, were destroyed in the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries.\n\nTheoderic built the Palace of Theoderic for himself in Ravenna, modeled on the Great Palace of Constantinople. It was an expansion of an earlier Roman structure. The palace church of Christ the Redeemer survives and is known today as the Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo. An equestrian statue of Theoderic was erected in the square in front of the palace. This may have been the \"Regisole\", which was moved to Pavia, then destroyed during the French Revolution by the local Jacobin Club.\nTheoderic the Great was interred in Ravenna, but his bones were scattered and his mausoleum was converted to a church after Belisarius conquered the city in 540. His mausoleum is one of the finest monuments in Ravenna. Unlike all the other contemporary buildings in Ravenna, which were made of brick, the Mausoleum of Theoderic was built completely from fine quality stone ashlars.\n\nThe Palace of Domitian on the Palatine Hill was reconstructed, using the receipts from a specially levied tax. The city walls of Rome were rebuilt, a feat celebrated by the Senate of Rome with a gilded statue of Theoderic. The Senate's Curia, the Theatre of Pompey, the city aqueducts, sewers and a granary were refurbished and repaired. Statues were set up in the Flavian Amphitheatre.\n\nIn 522 the philosopher Boethius became his \"magister officiorum\" (head of all the government and court services). Boethius was a dedicated Hellenist bent on translating all the works of Aristotle into Latin and harmonizing them with the works of Plato. A year later, he was imprisoned and put to death after being accused of treasonous correspondence with the Eastern emperor Justin I.\n\nIn the meantime Cassiodorus had succeeded Boethius as \"magister\" in 523. The pliant historian and courtier could be counted on to provide refined touches to official correspondence. \"To the monarch you [Cassiodorus] were a friendly judge and an honored intimate. For when he became free from his official cares, he looked to your conversation for the precepts of the sages, that he might make himself a worthy equal to the great men of old. Ever curious, he desired to hear about the courses of the stars, the tides of the sea, and legendary fountains, that his earnest study of natural science might make him seem to be a veritable philosopher in the purple\" (Cassiodorus' letterbook, \"Variae\" 9.24.8). The gulf was widening between the ancient senatorial aristocracy, whose center was Rome, and the adherents of Gothic rule at Ravenna: other distinguished public figures followed Boethius to the block.\n\nTheoderic in his final years was no longer the disengaged Arian patron of religious toleration that he had seemed earlier in his reign. \"Indeed, his death cut short what could well have developed into a major persecution of Catholic churches in retaliation for measures taken by Justinian in Constantinople against Arians there\"\n\nTheoderic was of the Arian faith. At the end of his reign quarrels arose with his Roman subjects and the Byzantine emperor Justin I over the Arianism issue. Relations between the two nations deteriorated, although Theoderic's ability dissuaded the Byzantines from waging war against him. After his death, that reluctance faded quickly.\n\nTheoderich as \"Dietrich von Bern\" is an important figure in Middle High German literature, and as Þiðrekr in Old Icelandic. In German legends, Dietrich becomes an exile from his native kingdom of Lombardy, fighting with the help of Etzel against his usurping uncle, Ermenrich. Only the Old High German Hildebrandslied still contains Odoacer as Dietrich's antagonist. The Old Norse version, based on German sources, moves the location of Dietrich (Thidrek)'s life to Westphalia and northern Germany. The legends paint a generally positive picture of Dietrich, with only some influence from the negative traditions of the church visible.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8376433", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8376433", "title": "Trope (philosophy)", "text": "Trope (philosophy)\n\nThe term \"trope\" is both a term which denotes figurative and metaphorical language and one which has been used in various technical senses. The term \"trope\" derives from the Greek τρόπος (\"tropos\"), \"a turn, a change\", related to the root of the verb τρέπειν (\"trepein\"), \"to turn, to direct, to alter, to change\"; this means that the term is used metaphorically to denote, among other things, metaphorical language. Perhaps the term can be explained as meaning the same thing as \"a turn of phrase\" in its original sense.\n\nThe term is also used in technical senses, which do not always correspond to its linguistic origin. Its meaning has to be judged from the context, some of which are given below.\n\nHere a trope is a figurative and metaphorical use of a word or a phrase. The verb \"to trope\" means then to make a trope.\n\nA trope or mode is one of the ten skeptical arguments or \"ways of refuting dogmatism\", also called The Ten Modes of Pyrrhonism, described by the Greek physician and philosopher Sextus Empiricus.\n\nThe use of tropes has been extended from a linguistic usage to the field of philosophy of history by, among other theorists, Hayden White in his \"Metahistory\" (1973). Tropes are generally understood to be styles of discourse — rather than figures of style — underlying the historian's writing of history. They are historically determined in as much as the historiography of every period is defined by a specific type of trope.\n\nFor Hayden White, tropes historically unfolded in this sequence: metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche, and finally, irony.\n\nTrope theory (or trope nominalism) in metaphysics is a version of nominalism. Here, a trope is a particular instance of a property, like the specific redness of a rose, or the specific nuance of green of a leaf. Trope theories assume that universals are unnecessary. This use of the term goes back to D. C. Williams (1953). The basic problem has been discussed previously in philosophy without using the term \"trope\". The following is a brief background:\n\nThe basic problem is the problem of universals. One part of the problem of universals is determining what it is for two tokens (or separate instances of something) to be of the same type. How can different things be the same? The arguments are complex, and involve semantics, metaphysics and epistemology. Part of the problem would be determining what it is for six different green objects to all be the same in respect to their color.\n\nOne classical solution is that of realism as found in the middle period of Plato's philosophy, with the \"Republic\" as a crowning work. According to this solution there are ideas or forms for any property. These forms exist timelessly as singular, perfect individuals in a metaphysical (timeless, supra-sensible) world of their own. They correspond to what is later called universals. Somehow the form of a specific color creates many secondary images of itself, as when a prototype is used to make copies or an object casts several shadows. Expressed more abstractly the individual colour-instances (the green of this leaf, the similar green of this frog) all partake in the same idea of green. In Plato the theory of forms is related to his theses about innate knowledge. In \"Phaedo\" the turn of the argument is that we cannot learn from experience what similarity is through abstraction, but must possess it in an innate form before we have any experience (\"Phaedo\" 74a-75d).\n\nNevertheless, Plato in the \"Parmenides\" dialogue himself formulated several problems for his view. One is: How can the idea, being single, nevertheless be present in a multitude of separate instances without being split apart.\n\nThe other solution is that of nominalism. Here the thesis is that universals such as the ideas or forms of Plato are unnecessary in an explanation of language, thought and the world. Only single individuals are real, but they can be grouped together by a human observer through their similarities. Nominalists are usually empiricists. Berkeley, for example, argued against universals or abstract objects using nominalistic arguments. He used the term idea to denote specific perceptions of an atomistic nature. They could be grouped through similarities or one could take a specific instance, for example the green hue of this frog one is looking at now, as a kind of paradigm case or prototype, and regard everything that was similar to it as belonging to the same type or category. One attraction of the nominalistic program is that if it can be carried out it solves Plato's problem in Parmenides, since the need for a single idea or form or universal \"green\" then vanishes and it can be expunged through Occam's razor, i.e. the rule that, other things being equal, one should not multiply explanatory entities beyond necessity.\n\nBertrand Russell (1912, chapter IX) argued against Berkeley and took the same basic position as Plato. His argument was basically one against any form of nominalism. It says, briefly, that if we introduce several instances of green as separate individuals, we nevertheless have to accept that the reason that we group them together is because they are similar. Therefore, we must presume at least one true universal, that of similarity.\n\nTwo popular recent solutions to the problem of universals, as it relates to the possibility of entities existing in multiple locations at the same time, are as follows.\n\nDavid Armstrong, a prominent Australian philosopher, argues, that there are instantiated universals, like Russell and the middle Plato. Briefly, an instantiated universal is a property (such as being green) that can exist in multiple locations at the same time. Going back to the problem of universals, for six different objects to all be green would be for each object to instantiate the universal green. The very same, identical universal green would be wholly located at each green object. To be even more specific, if a frog and a leaf are the same shade of green, the green of the frog and the green of the leaf are one and the same entity (qua green-ness), which happens to be multiply located.\n\nD. C. Williams and Keith Campbell, among others, reject instantiated universals in favor of tropes. Briefly, a trope is a property (such as being green) that can only exist in one location at one time. Trope theorists explain what it is for two tokens (individual instances) to be of the same type in terms of resemblance. As an example, for six different objects to all be green would be for each object to have its own distinct green trope. Each green trope would be a different entity from the other green tropes, but they would \"resemble\" each other and would all be taken to be green because of their resemblance. \n\nA metaphysical doctrine embracing both tropes and the objects on which the tropes depend was elaborated by Edmund Husserl in his \"Logical Investigations\", as part of what Husserl called 'formal ontology'. Husserl's ideas in this respect were used as the basis for the theory of truthmaking put forward by Kevin Mulligan, Peter Simons and Barry Smith in \"Truthmakers\" (1984) According to this theory it is tropes -- including both individual qualities and events -- that serve as the truthmakers for true atomic sentences such as 'John is hot' or 'Mary is loved by John' or 'John kicked Bill'.\n\n\n\n"}

Two-way communication has also been referred to as interpersonal communication. Common forms of two-way communication are:\n\n\nA cycle of communication and two-way communication are actually two different things. If we examine closely the anatomy of communication – the actual structure and parts – we will discover that a cycle of communication is not a two-way communication in its entirety. Meaning, two way communication is not as simple as one may infer. One can improve two-way or interpersonal communication by focusing on the eyes of the person speaking, making eye contact, watching body language, responding appropriately with comments, questions, and paraphrasing, and summarizing to confirm main points and an accurate understanding.\n\nTwo-way communication is different from one-way communication in that two-way communication occurs when the receiver provides feedback to the sender. One-way communication is when a message flows from sender to receiver only, thus providing no feedback. Some examples of one-way communication include: radio or television programs or even listening to policy statements from top executives. Two-way communication is especially significant in that it enables feedback to improve a situation.\n\nTwo-way communication involves feedback from the receiver to the sender. This allows the sender to know the message was received accurately by the receiver. Communication is also negotiated which means that the sender and receiver listen to each other, the messages then gathers information to respond. One person is the sender, which means they send a message to another person via face to face, email, telephone, etc. The other person is the receiver, which means they are the one getting the senders message. Once receiving the message, the receiver sends a response back. For example, Person A sends an email to Person B --> Person B responds with their own email back to Person A. The cycle then continues.\nThis chart demonstrates two-way communication and feedback.\n\nTwo-way communication may occur horizontally or vertically in the organization. When information is exchanged between superior and subordinate, it is known as vertical two-way communication. On the other hand, when communication takes place between persons holding the same rank or position, it is called horizontal two-way communication. Two-way communication is represented in the following diagrams: (Cite: https://thebusinesscommunication.com/two-way-communication-and-importance/) \n\nThere are many different types of two-way communication systems, and choosing which is best to use depends on things like the intended use, the location, the number of users, the frequency band, and the cost of the system. “Regardless of the type of system chosen, the one common feature is that all of the components must be compatible and work together to support a common purpose.”\nAmateur Radio is used for entertainment and as a hobby by many groups of people. These individuals label themselves as “Hams.” Amateur Radios are also known to be a reliable means of communication when all other forms are not operating. In times of disaster, communication through Amateur radios has led to lives being saved.\nCitizens band radio, CB radio, can be used by anyone who is not a member of a foreign government. It is meant for short range communication using devices that mimic walkie-talkies.\nFamily Radio Service, FRS, is also meant for short range communication using devices that mimic walkie-talkies. Like the CB radio, the FRS does not require a license and can be used by anyone who is not a member of a foreign government.\n\nInstant messaging became wildly popular around 1996 and spread even more with AOL in 1997. The concept behind IM is that it is a way of quick communication between two people due to tools such as knowing when messages are seen or knowing when others are online. Many social media sites have integrated IM into their sites as ways to spread communication. Chat Rooms are very similar, only they are messages to a group of people. Chat rooms are often public; meaning that you can send a message and anyone can freely join the “room” and view the message as well as respond.\n\nAs it relates to business, 75% of people believe in-person communication is critical. In-person interaction is useful for resolving problems more efficiently, generating long-term relationships, and resolving a problem or creating an opportunity quickly. 4 out of 6 of the most important attributes of building a relationship cannot be achieved without the power of in-person, which requires a rich communication environment. Business executives believe in-person collaboration is critical for more than 50 percent of key business strategic and tactical business processes when engaging with colleagues, customers, or partners.\n\nThe telephone is a device that is relatively easy to understand and use. In fact, the telephone connections used today have remained remarkably unchanged compared to those used almost a century ago. In addition, your connection to the phone company is rather straightforward as well. The telephone makes it easy to connect instantly with others from all over the world, making it simple to have a two-way conversation with a neighbor or with someone many miles away. Phones have undergone some changes over the years. Today, for example, phones use electronic switches instead of operators. The switch uses a dial tone so that when you pick up the phone you are aware that both the switch and the phone are functioning properly.\n\nComputer networks are used to have two-way communication by having computers exchange data. Ways that this is possible is wired interconnects and wireless interconnects. Types of wired interconnects are Ethernets and fiber optic cables. Ethernets connect local devices through Ethernet cables. Fiber runs underground for long distances and is the main source of Internet in most homes and businesses. Types of wireless interconnects include Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. The problem with these networks is that they don't have unlimited connection span. To expand the reach there are wide area interconnects such as satellite and cellular networks. Also, there are long distance interconnects which need \"backhaul\" to move the data back and forth and \"last mile\" to connect the provider to the network.\n"}

Unisex names are common in the English speaking world, especially in the United States. By contrast, some countries have laws preventing unisex names, requiring parents to give their children sex-specific names. In other countries, unisex names are sometimes avoided for social reasons such as potential discrimination, ridicule, and psychological abuse.\n\nNames may have different gender connotations from country to country or language to language. For example, the Italian male name \"Andrea\" (derived from Greek \"Andreas\") is understood as a female name in many languages, such as English, German, Hungarian, Czech, and Spanish.\n\nParents may name their child in honor of a person of another sex, which – if done widely – can result in the name becoming unisex. For example, Christians, particularly Catholics, may give a child a second/middle name of the opposite sex, e.g. name a son Marie or Maria in honor of the Virgin Mary or formerly Anne for Saint Anne; or name a daughter José in honor of Saint Joseph or Jean in honor of John the Baptist. This practice is rare in English-speaking countries.\n\nSome masculine and feminine names are homophones, pronounced the same for both sexes but spelled differently. For example, Yves and Eve and (for some speakers) Artemus and Artemis. These names are not strictly unisex names.\n\nUnisex names can be used as a source of humor, such as Julia Sweeney's sexually ambiguous character \"Pat\" on \"Saturday Night Live\". A running joke on the TV show \"Scrubs\" is that almost every woman J.D. sleeps with has a unisex name: Jordan, Alex, Danni, Elliot, Jamie, Kim, etc. Similarly, the sex of the baby Jamie in \"Malcolm in the Middle\" was purposely kept ambiguous when first introduced at the end of the show's fourth season to build suspense. In \"Gilmore Girls\", Rory is bothered by the discovery that her boyfriend Logan's workmate Bobby, is female. Rory had assumed Bobby was male and it is only upon their first meeting that Rory discovers Bobby's gender. The name \"Rory\" was historically a male name until \"Gilmore Girls\" reached popularity, at which point the name reached rough gender parity.\n\nIn Japanese dramas and manga, a unisex name may be given to an androgynous or gender-bending character as part of a plot twist to aid in presenting the character as one sex when they are actually another.\n\nIn mystery fiction, unisex names have been used to tease readers into trying to solve the mystery of a character's sex. The novels of Sarah Caudwell feature a narrator named Hilary Tamar, a law professor who is never identified as either male or female.\n\nUnisex names of African origin include:\n\n\n\n\nShona, a Bantu group in Zimbabwe, have unisex names which may indicate the circumstances of the baby or the family during the time of the birth.

Some popular examples are:\n\nMany Indian names become unisex when written with Latin characters because of the limitations of transliteration. The spellings \"Chandra\" and \"Krishna\", for example, are transliterations of both the masculine and feminine versions of those names. In Indian languages, the final \"a\" in each of these names are different letters with different pronunciations, so there is no ambiguity. However, when they are seen (and usually, spoken) by someone unfamiliar with Indian languages, they become sexually ambiguous. Other Indian names, such as \"Ananda\", are exclusively or nearly exclusively masculine in India, but because of their \"a\" ending, are assumed to be feminine in Anglophone societies. \n\nMany unisex names in India are obvious and ridiculed. For instance Nehal, Sonal, Snehal, Niral, Pranjal and Anmol are used commonly to name baby boys or girls in western states of India such as Gujarat. Similarly, names like Kajal, Sujal, Viral, Harshal, Deepal, Bobby, Mrinal, Jyoti, Shakti, Nilam, Kiran, Lucky, Ashwini, Shashi, Malhar, Umang, Shubham and Anupam are also very common sex-neutral names or unisex names in India. Most Punjabi Sikh first names such as \"Sandeep, Gurdeep, Kuldeep, Mandeep\", \"Surjeet, Gurjeet, Kuljeet, Harjeet, Manjeet\", \"Harpreet, Gurpreet, Jaspreet, Kulpreet, Manpreet\", \"Prabhjot, Harjot, Gurjot, Jasjot\" and \"Sukhjinder, Bhupinder, Jasbinder, Parminder, Kulvinder, Harjinder, Ranjodh, Sheeraz, Hardeep, Kirandeep, Sukhdeep, Govindpal, Encarl, Rajan\" are unisex names and equally commonly given to either sex. Also, names derived from Dari Persian and Arabic, but not used among native speakers of those languages, are common among South Asian Muslims. Since Persian does not assign genders to inanimate nouns, some of these names are gender-neutral, for example Roshan, Parveen, and Insaaf.\n\n\nDespite there being only a small number of Japanese unisex names in use, unisex names are widely popular. Many high-profile Japanese celebrities such as Hikaru Utada, Jun Matsumoto, Ryo Nishikido, Tomomi Kahala, Harumi Nemoto, Izumi Sakai, and Shizuka Arakawa have unisex names.\n\nUnisex names may also be used as nicknames. For example, a man named Ryounosuke and a woman named Ryouko may both use the unisex name Ryou as a nickname.\n\n\nThere are many Turkish names which are unisex. These names are almost always pure Turkish names (i.e. not Turkified Arabic names that have an Islamic connotation) that derive from Turkish words. These names may either be modern names or be derived from Turkic mythology. Some Persian-derived Turkish names, like Can and Cihan, are also unisex, as are even a few Arabic-derived names, like İhsan and Nur.\n\nAmong the common examples of the many unisex names in Turkey include:\n\nAmong modern Vietnamese names, unisex names are very popular. Vietnamese tend to distinguish unisex names by middle names (for example Quốc Khánh is a male name and Ngân Khánh is a female name). In many cases, a male could have a female name and vice versa. Popular examples of unisex names in Vietnam are: \n\n\n\nUnisex names have been enjoying some popularity in English-speaking countries in the past several decades. Masculine names have become increasingly popular among females in the past century but originally feminine names remain extremely rare among males.\n\nUnisex names include:\n\nIn the United States, most of the male names are now largely female, while in Britain, some (notably Charlie, Hilary, Sidney, and Robin) remain largely male. Sometimes different spellings have different sex distributions (Francis is less likely female than Frances), but these are rarely definitive. For example, in the US, as of 2016, both Skylar and Skyler are more common for females, but Skylar is most strongly associated with females (the 42nd most common name for females and the 761 most common for males born in 2016). than Skyler (the 359 most common name for females and the 414 most common for males born in 2016)\n\nModern unisex names may derive from:\n\nExamples of unisex names among celebrities and their children include:\n\nAccording to the Social Security Administration, Jayden has been the most popular unisex name for boys since 2008 and Madison has been the most popular unisex name for girls since 2000 in the United States. Prior to Jayden, Logan was the most popular unisex name for boys and prior to Madison, Alexis was the most popular unisex name for girls.\n\nMany popular nicknames are unisex. Some nicknames, such as Alex and Pat, have become popular as given names in their own right. The following list of unisex nicknames are most commonly seen in English-speaking countries such as Canada, the United States, Australia, South Africa, and the United Kingdom.\n\nFinnish law bans giving \"female child a male name and male child a female name\" among other restrictions. Some ambiguous names do exist, which have been given to children of both sexes. A partial list includes:\n\n\nMany of these names are rare, foreign or neologism, established names tend to be strongly sex-specific. Notably, a class of names that are derived from nature can be often used for either sex, for example: Aalto (wave), Halla (frost), Lumi (snow), Paju (willow), Ruska (fall colors), and Valo (light). Similarly, there are some (sometimes archaic) adjectives which carry no strong gender connotations, like Kaino (timid), Vieno (calm) or Lahja (a gift). Certain names can have unisex diminutives, such as Alex, which can be short for Aleksandra or Aleksanteri (or variants thereof).\n\nPopular unisex names of French origin include:\n\n\nThere are also pairs of masculine and feminine names that have slightly different spelling but identical pronunciation, such as André / Andrée, Frédéric / Frédérique and Gabriel / Gabrielle. In France and French-speaking countries, it can happen for people to have a combination of both masculine and feminine given names, but most of these include \"Marie\", such as Jean-Marie, Marie-Jean, Marie-Pierre. Marie was a unisex name in medieval times; it is nowadays only female except for its presence in compound names. Notable examples of people with a combination of masculine and feminine given names are Jean-Marie Le Pen (male), Marie-Jean Hérault de Séchelles (male), Marie-Pierre Kœnig (male), and Marie-Pierre Leray (female).\n\nEuropean royals often bear the name Marie, the French form of Maria, in their names. Prince Amedeo of Belgium, Archduke of Austria-Este (Amedeo Marie Joseph Carl Pierre Philippe Paola Marcus), Prince Jean of Luxembourg (Jean Félix Marie Guillaume), and Jean, Grand Duke of Luxembourg (Jean Benoît Guillaume Robert Antoine Louis Marie Adolphe Marc) are examples of male royals who bear Marie in their names.\n\nIn the past, German law required parents to give their child a sex-specific name. This is no longer the case, since the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany held in 2008 that there is no obligation for a name to be sex-specific, even if the child has only one given name. The custom of adding a second name which matches the child's legal sex is no longer required. Still, unisex names of German origin are rare, most of them being nicknames rather than formal names (such as Alex).\n\nExamples of unisex names include: \n\n\n\nUnisex names are in general illegal in Iceland (the given name \"Blær\" one of the few exceptions, the first reversal by a judge (and accepted will not be appealed to the Supreme Court) of former denial (as a female name); and e.g. \"Auður\" later approved for males, while \"Alex\" was denied for females later that the same year). The Icelandic Naming Committee (Icelandic: \"Mannanafnanefnd\") has preapproved lists of male and female names (with e.g. \"Ofur\" (e. Super or Uber), \"Lady\", and \"X\" (as middle name) declined, and for instance \"Þyrnirós\" (e. Sleeping Beauty, while literally meaning \"a rose with thorns\") is approved for females).\n\nAdditionally traditional patronymic (or rarely matronymic or both) Icelandic last names (by law) cannot be unisex. The suffix of the last name \"-dóttir\" (\"daughter\") is used for female sex; males use the suffix \"-son\" (rare exceptions for foreign females: when using husband's last name as a family name; family names are in general illegal with few exceptions). Given names are also clearly (to Icelanders) masculine or feminine, and linguistic gender has to match the gender identity of the person.\n\n, the law has been successfully challenged once, for the given male name \"Blær\" (transliterated Blaer) which was exceptionally allowed to be used for females. The Icelandic Naming Committee had for 14 years rejected the registration of Blær as a girl's name in the national census, and the girl in question was registered with the default given name \"stelpa\" (\"girl\") as the name was not on the list of about 1,853 approved female names. A lower court deemed the name additionally legal for females and the state decided not to use its right to appeal.\n\nAmong the few exceptions to the gender agreement rule are the traditional name Sturla, linguistically feminine, from medieval history always applies to males; and Ilmur (\"fragrance\" or \"odour\"), linguistically masculine, must apply to females.\n\n\nIn Italy, unisex names are very rare. There are basically male names like i.e. Andrea (which is female i.e. in English, Spanish, German or French), Elia or Mattia that can also be given to females. Names like Celeste, Amabile, Fiore, Loreto, or Diamante are, as opposite, female names that occasionally can be given to males.\n\nSometimes \"Maria\" is used as a middle male name (such as Antonio Maria).\n\n\"Rosario\" (feminine: \"Rosaria\") is a male name in Italian whereas in Spanish is female.\n\nThere are also unisex nicknames, i.e. Giusi or Giusy that can stand either for Giuseppe or Giuseppina, respectively \"Joseph\" and \"Josephine\"; Dani or Dany which stand for Daniele (male) or Daniela (female); Alex that can stand for Alessandro (male) as well as for Alessandra (female); Fede (literally: \"Faith\") that can stand either for Federico or Federica.\n\n\nNames that end with an \"i\" are considered unisex in Brazil. They tend to be Native Brazilian Indian names in origin, such as Araci, Jaci, Darci, Ubirani, but names from other cultures are now being absorbed, such as Remy, Wendy, and Eddy. Names that end with \"ir\" and \"mar\" tend to be unisex also, such as Nadir, Aldenir, Dagmar and Niomar - though in these cases there are some exceptions.\n\nDiminutive forms of names in Russian language can be unisex, such as Sasha/Shura (Alexandr or Alexandra), Zhenya (Yevgeniy or Yevgeniya), Valya (Valentin or Valentina), Valera (Valeriy or Valeriya), Slava (for names ending with -slav or -slava).\n\n\nIn Spain, unisex names are extremely rare. María, an originally feminine name is used in Spanish for males as second name, very commonly after José (e.g., José María). José is used for females preceded by María (María José). Also Guadalupe, a feminine name is sometimes used as masculine after José (José Guadalupe). More names given to both genders include Carmen, Inés, Reno, Trinidad, Nazaret, Reyes, and Celes. \n\nLike in English, some common nicknames are unisex such as Álex (Alejandro, Alejandra), Cris (Cristina, Cristian, Cristóbal), Dani (Daniel, Daniela).\n\nSome names are masculine in one culture and feminine in another, so that when these cultures mix in a third location, the same name appears unisex. Some example are:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11429497", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11429497", "title": "Vortigern and Rowena", "text": "Vortigern and Rowena\n\nVortigern and Rowena, or Vortigern, an Historical Play is a play that was touted as a newly discovered work by William Shakespeare when it first appeared in 1796. It was eventually revealed to be a Shakespeare hoax, the product of prominent forger William Henry Ireland. Its first performance was April 2, 1796, when it was ridiculed by the audience. Its titular protagonists, Vortigern and Rowena, are figures from Britain's traditional history.\n\nIreland had produced several earlier documents he claimed represented the writings of Shakespeare, but \"Vortigern and Rowena\" was the first play he attempted. He shortly followed it with a forged \"Henry II\". He had announced his \"discovery\" of the lost play as early as December 26, 1794, but did not show his father a manuscript until March 1795. He also provided a purported correspondence between Shakespeare and a printer explaining why the play was unpublished, as well as a deed accounting for how it came to be in hands of the Irelands. According to the deed, Shakespeare had willed all the manuscripts to an ancestor of the Irelands, also named William Henry Ireland, who had saved him from drowning. Years later, Ireland explained that he came up with this story to establish his right to the manuscripts in case a descendant of the bard might claim them.\n\nHearing of a newly recovered \"lost\" Shakespeare play, Irish playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan purchased the rights to the first production at Drury Lane Theatre in London for 300 pounds and the promise of half the revenues to Ireland's family. After reading the play, Sheridan noted its relative simplicity compared to Shakespeare's known works. Actor John Philip Kemble, the manager of Drury Lane, and who would play the title role in the play's only production, had serious doubts about \"Vortigern\"'s authenticity. Sarah Siddons, who had been cast as the title female role, dropped out one week before the scheduled opening for unknown reasons, though it is suspected that Kemble had successfully turned the famous actress against the work as well. Irish Shakespearean scholar Edmond Malone published \"An Inquiry into the Authenticity of Certain Miscellaneous Papers and Legal Instruments\" on March 21, 1796, about the authenticity of \"Vortigern\" and the other documents \"discovered\" by Ireland. Siddons' role of \"Edmunda\" was taken by Mrs Powell when it opened on 2 April 1796. The play did have its supporters; Henry James Pye and James Bland Burgess wrote prologues for it, while Robert Merry wrote an epilogue. \n\nWhen \"Vortigern and Rowena\" opened on April 2, 1796, Kemble used the chance to hint at his opinion by repeating Vortigern's line \"and when this solemn mockery is o'er,\" and the play was derided by the audience. It was never performed again until 2008. Some early critics accused William Henry Ireland's father Samuel of the forgery, though William assumed responsibility in two printed confessions. Samuel himself continued to regard the play as authentic and edited it in 1799, including a foreword in which he attacked Malone's findings and denounced the \"illiberal and injurious treatment\" he had received. Nevertheless, neither Ireland's reputation recovered from the fiasco, and William eventually moved to France, where he lived for several decades. He tried to publish \"Vortigern and Rowena\" as his own work when he returned to England in 1832, but met with little success.\n\nThe story begins as the King of the Britons Constantius offers half his crown to his adviser Vortigern for his loyal service. Vortigern immediately plots the king's murder in order to take the crown for himself. Meanwhile, the court Fool warns two of Vortigern's children, Pascentius and Flavia, of the bad times ahead and the three of them leave the court with Flavia in drag. Constantius' sons Aurelius (Ambrosius Aurelianus) and Uter (Uther Pendragon), studying in Rome, receive word of Vortigern's treachery and go to Scotland to raise an army against their father's killer. In response Vortigern summons an army of Saxons, led by Hengist and Horsus, to defend him from the Scots. He falls in love with Hengist's beautiful daughter Rowena, and proclaims her his queen, much to the chagrin of his wife Edmunda and his two remaining sons, Wortimerus (Vortimer) and Catagrinus (Catigern), who flee. Vortigern's family eventually all join Aurelius and Uter's army, and Aurelius and Flavia declare their mutual love. In the end the Saxons are routed and Aurelius defeats Vortigern but spares his life, and then marries Flavia. The final speech is delivered by the Fool, who admits that the play is not very tragic, as \"none save bad do fall, which draws no tear\".\n\nLike other apocryphal plays attributed to Shakespeare, \"The Birth of Merlin\" and \"Locrine\", \"Vortigern and Rowena\" takes the Matter of Britain as its subject, drawing especially from Geoffrey of Monmouth's \"Historia Regum Britanniae\" and Raphael Holinshed's \"Chronicle\", the same source used by Shakespeare. Shakespeare used Britain's mythical history in several of his plays, including \"King Lear\" and \"Cymbeline\", based on the stories of Leir of Britain and Cunobelinus, respectively. The play is essentially a pastiche of Shakespeare, with Vortigern serving as a Macbeth figure; other Shakespearean elements include the use of Holinshead and Flavia's cross-dressing.\n\nThe play experienced a comedic revival by the Pembroke Players at the Pembroke College New Cellars, Cambridge, on November 19, 2008. The production was directed by Pembroke third-year Alexander Whiscombe, and starred David Harrap in the title role with Eystein Thanisch as Aurelius. The American Shakespeare Center in Staunton, Virginia included the play as part of its Staged Reading Series in November, 2013.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "34272", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34272", "title": "Yiddish", "text": "Yiddish\n\nYiddish (, or , \"yidish\"/\"idish\", \"Jewish\", ; in older sources ייִדיש-טײַטש \"Yidish-Taitsh\", Judaeo-German) is the historical language of the Ashkenazi Jews. It originated during the 9th century in Central Europe, providing the nascent Ashkenazi community with a High German-based vernacular fused with elements taken from Hebrew and Aramaic as well as from Slavic languages and traces of Romance languages. Yiddish is written with a fully vocalized version of the Hebrew alphabet.\n\nThe earliest surviving references date from the 12th century and call the language (\"loshn-ashknaz\", \"language of Ashkenaz\") or (\"taytsh\"), a variant of \"tiutsch\", the contemporary name for Middle High German. Colloquially, the language is sometimes called (\"mame-loshn\", \"mother tongue\"), distinguishing it from (\"loshn koydesh\", \"holy tongue\"), meaning Hebrew and Aramaic. The term \"Yiddish\", short for \"Yidish Taitsh\" \"Jewish German\", did not become the most frequently used designation in the literature until the 18th century. In the late 19th and into the 20th century the language was more commonly called \"Jewish\", especially in non-Jewish contexts, but \"Yiddish\" is again the more common designation today.\n\nModern Yiddish has two major forms. Eastern Yiddish is far more common today. It includes Southeastern (Ukrainian–Romanian), Mideastern (Polish–Galician–Eastern Hungarian), and Northeastern (Lithuanian–Belarusian) dialects. Eastern Yiddish differs from Western both by its far greater size and by the extensive inclusion of words of Slavic origin. Western Yiddish is divided into Southwestern (Swiss–Alsatian–Southern German), Midwestern (Central German), and Northwestern (Netherlandic–Northern German) dialects. Yiddish is used in a number of Haredi Jewish communities worldwide; it is the first language of the home, school, and in many social settings among many Haredi Jews, and is used in most Hasidic and many Lithuanian yeshivas.\n\nThe term \"Yiddish\" is also used in the adjectival sense, synonymously with \"Jewish\", to designate attributes of Yiddishkeit (\"Ashkenazi culture\"; for example, Yiddish cooking and \"Yiddish music\": klezmer).\n\nPrior to the Holocaust, there were 11–13 million speakers of Yiddish among 17 million Jews worldwide. 85% of the approximately 6 million Jews who died in the Holocaust were Yiddish speakers, leading to a massive decline in the use of the language. Assimilation following World War II and \"aliyah\", immigration to Israel, further decreased the use of Yiddish both among survivors and among Yiddish-speakers from other countries (such as in the Americas). However, the number of speakers is increasing in Hasidic communities.\n\nThe established view is that, as with other Jewish languages, Jews speaking distinct languages learned new co-territorial vernaculars, which they then Judaized. In the case of Yiddish, this scenario sees it as emerging when speakers of Zarphatic and other Judeo-Romance languages began to acquire varieties of Middle High German, and from these groups the Ashkenazi community took shape. Exactly what German base lies behind the earliest form of Yiddish is disputed.\n\nIn Weinreich's model, Jewish speakers of Old French or Old Italian who were literate in either liturgical Hebrew or Aramaic, or both, migrated through Southern Europe to settle in the Rhine Valley in an area known as Lotharingia (later known in Yiddish as \"Loter\") extending over parts of Germany and France; There, they encountered and were influenced by Jewish speakers of High German languages and several other German dialects. Both Weinreich and Solomon Birnbaum developed this model further in the mid-1950s. In Weinreich's view, this Old Yiddish substrate later bifurcated into two distinct versions of the language, Western and Eastern Yiddish. They retained the Semitic vocabulary and constructions needed for religious purposes and created a Judeo-German form of speech, sometimes not accepted as a fully autonomous language.\n\nLater linguistic research has finessed the Weinreich model or provided alternative approaches to the language's origins, with points of contention being the characterization of its Germanic base, the source of its Hebrew/Aramaic adstrata, and the means and location of this fusion. Some theorists argue that the fusion occurred with a Bavarian dialect base. The two main candidates for the germinal matrix of Yiddish, the Rhineland and Bavaria, are not necessarily incompatible. There may have been parallel developments in the two regions, seeding the Western and Eastern dialects of Modern Yiddish. Dovid Katz proposes that Yiddish emerged from contact between speakers of High German and Aramaic-speaking Jews from the Middle East. The lines of development proposed by the different theories do not necessarily rule out the others (at least not entirely); an article in \"The Forward\" argues that \"in the end, a new 'standard theory' of Yiddish’s origins will probably be based on the work of Weinreich and his challengers alike.\"\n\nPaul Wexler proposed a model in 1991 that took Yiddish, by which he means primarily eastern Yiddish, not to be genetically grounded in a Germanic language at all, but rather as \"Judeo-Sorbian\" (a proposed West Slavic language) that had been relexified by High German. In more recent work, Wexler has argued that Eastern Yiddish is unrelated genetically to Western Yiddish. Wexler's model has met with little academic support, and strong critical challenges, especially among historical linguists.\n\nBy the 10th century, a distinctive Jewish culture had formed in Central Europe which came to be called \"Ashkenazi\", \"Ashkenazi Jews, from \"Ashkenaz\" (), the medieval Hebrew name for northern Europe and Germany. Ashkenaz was centered on the Rhineland and the Palatinate (notably Worms and Speyer), in what is now the westernmost part of Germany. Its geographic extent did not coincide with the German principalities of the time, and it included northern France. Ashkenaz bordered on the area inhabited by another distinctive Jewish cultural group, the Sephardi Jews, who ranged into southern France. Ashkenazi culture later spread into Eastern Europe with large-scale population migrations.\n\nNothing is known with certainty about the vernacular of the earliest Jews in Germany, but several theories have been put forward. The first language of the Ashkenazim may, as noted above, have been the Aramaic language, the vernacular of the Jews in Roman-era Judea and ancient and early medieval Mesopotamia. The widespread use of Aramaic among the large non-Jewish Syrian trading population of the Roman provinces, including those in Europe, would have reinforced the use of Aramaic among Jews engaged in trade. In Roman times, many of the Jews living in Rome and Southern Italy appear to have been Greek-speakers, and this is reflected in some Ashkenazi personal names (e.g., \"Kalonymos\" and Yiddish \"Todres\"). Hebrew, on the other hand, was regarded as a holy language reserved for ritual and spiritual purposes and not for common use. Much work needs to be done, though, to fully analyze the contributions of those languages to Yiddish.\n\nIt is generally accepted that early Yiddish was likely to have contained elements from other languages of the Near East and Europe, absorbed through migrations. Since some settlers may have come via France and Italy, it is also likely that the Romance-based Jewish languages of those regions were represented. Traces remain in the contemporary Yiddish vocabulary: for example, (\"bentshn\", \"to bless\"), ultimately from the Latin \"\"; (\"leyenen\", \"to read\"), from the Old French \"lei(e)re\"; and the personal names Bunim (related to French \" bon nom\", good name) and Yentl (Old French \"gentil\", \"noble\"). Western Yiddish includes additional words of ultimate Latin derivation (but still very few): for example, \"orn\" (to pray), cf. Old French \"orer\".\n\nThe Jewish community in the Rhineland would have encountered the many dialects from which Standard German would emerge a few centuries later. In time, Jewish communities would have been speaking their own versions of these German dialects, mixed with linguistic elements that they themselves brought into the region. Although not reflected in the spoken language, a main point of difference was the use of the Hebrew alphabet for the recording of the Germanic vernacular, which may have been adopted either because of the community's familiarity with the alphabet or to prevent the non-Jewish population from understanding the correspondence. In addition, there was probably widespread illiteracy in the non-Hebrew script, with the level of illiteracy in the non-Jewish communities being even higher. Another point of difference was the use of Hebrew and Aramaic words. These words and terms were used because of their familiarity, but more so because in most cases there were no equivalent terms in the vernacular which could express the Jewish concepts or describe the objects of cultural significance.\n\nIt is not known when Yiddish orthography first developed. The oldest surviving literary document using it is a blessing in the Worms machzor, a Hebrew prayer book from 1272. There is a scalable image online at the indicated reference. The Worms machzor is discussed in Frakes, 2004, and Baumgarten, ed. Frakes, 2005 – see the \"Bibliography\" at the foot of this article.\n\nThis brief rhyme is decoratively embedded in an otherwise purely Hebrew text. Nonetheless, it indicates that the Yiddish of that day was a more or less regular Middle High German written in the Hebrew alphabet into which Hebrew words – , \"makhazor\" (prayerbook for the High Holy Days) and , \"synagogue\" (read in Yiddish as \"beis hakneses\") – had been included. The niqqud appears as though it might have been added by a second scribe, in which case it may need to be dated separately and may not be indicative of the pronunciation of the rhyme at the time of its initial annotation.\n\nOver the course of the 14th and 15th centuries, songs and poems in Yiddish, and macaronic pieces in Hebrew and German, began to appear. These were collected in the late 15th century by Menahem ben Naphtali Oldendorf. During the same period, a tradition seems to have emerged of the Jewish community's adapting its own versions of German secular literature. The earliest Yiddish epic poem of this sort is the \"Dukus Horant\", which survives in the famous Cambridge Codex T.-S.10.K.22. This 14th-century manuscript was discovered in the Cairo Geniza in 1896, and also contains a collection of narrative poems on themes from the Hebrew Bible and the Haggadah.\n\nThe advent of the printing press in the 16th century enabled the large scale production of works, at a cheaper cost, some of which have survived. One particularly popular work was Elia Levita's \"Bovo-Bukh\" (), composed around 1507–08 and printed several times, beginning in 1541 (Isny) (under the title: Bovo d'Antona). Levita, the earliest named Yiddish author, may also have written \"Pariz un Viene\" (Paris and Vienna). Another Yiddish retelling of a chivalric romance, װידװילט \"Vidvilt\" (often referred to as \"Widuwilt\" by Germanizing scholars), presumably also dates from the 15th century, although the manuscripts are from the 16th. It is also known as \"Kinig Artus Hof\", an adaptation of the Middle High German romance \"Wigalois\" by Wirnt von Gravenberg. Another significant writer is Avroham ben Schemuel Pikartei, who published a paraphrase on the Book of Job in 1557.\n\nWomen in the Ashkenazi community were traditionally not literate in Hebrew, but did read and write Yiddish. A body of literature therefore developed for which women were a primary audience. This included secular works, such as the \"Bovo-Bukh\", and religious writing specifically for women, such as the \"Tseno Ureno\" and the \"Tkhines\". One of the best-known early woman authors was Glückel of Hameln, whose memoirs are still in print.\nThe segmentation of the Yiddish readership, between women who read \"mame-loshn\" but not \"loshn-koydesh\", and men who read both, was significant enough that distinctive typefaces were used for each. The name commonly given to the semicursive form used exclusively for Yiddish was (\"vaybertaytsh\" = \"women's \"taytsh\",\" shown in the heading and fourth column in the adjacent illustration), with square Hebrew letters (shown in the third column) being reserved for text in that language and Aramaic. This distinction was retained in general typographic practice through to the early 19th century, with Yiddish books being set in \"vaybertaytsh\" (also termed \"mesheyt\" or \"mashket\"—the construction is uncertain).\n\nAn additional distinctive semicursive typeface was, and still is, used for rabbinical commentary on religious texts when Hebrew and Yiddish appear on the same page. This is commonly termed Rashi script, from the name of the most renowned early author, whose commentary is usually printed using this script. (Rashi is also the typeface normally used when the Sephardic counterpart to Yiddish, Judaeo-Spanish or \"Ladino\", is printed in Hebrew script.)\n\nThe Western Yiddish dialect—sometimes pejoratively labeled \"Mauscheldeutsch\", i. e. \"Moses German\"—declined in the 18th century, as the Age of Enlightenment and the \"Haskalah\" led to a view of Yiddish as a corrupt dialect. A \"Maskil\" (from the same root word as \"Haskalah\") would write about and promote acclimatization to the outside world. Jewish children began attending secular schools where the primary language spoken and taught was German, not Yiddish. Owing to both assimilation to German and the revival of Hebrew, Western Yiddish survived only as a language of \"intimate family circles or of closely knit trade groups\". (Liptzin 1972).\n\nIn eastern Europe, the response to these forces took the opposite direction, with Yiddish becoming the cohesive force in a secular culture (see the Yiddishist movement). Notable Yiddish writers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries are Sholem Yankev Abramovitch, writing as Mendele Mocher Sforim; Sholem Rabinovitsh, widely known as Sholem Aleichem, whose stories about (\"Tevye der milkhiker\", \"Tevye the Dairyman\") inspired the Broadway musical and film \"Fiddler on the Roof\"; and Isaac Leib Peretz.\n\nIn the early 20th century, especially after the Socialist October Revolution in Russia, Yiddish was emerging as a major Eastern European language. Its rich literature was more widely published than ever, Yiddish theatre and Yiddish cinema were booming, and it for a time achieved status as one of the official languages of the Ukrainian People's Republic, the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic and the short-lived Galician Soviet Socialist Republic, and the Jewish Autonomous Oblast. Educational autonomy for Jews in several countries (notably Poland) after World War I led to an increase in formal Yiddish-language education, more uniform orthography, and to the 1925 founding of the Yiddish Scientific Institute, YIVO. In Vilnius, there was debate over which language should take primacy, Hebrew or Yiddish.\n\nYiddish changed significantly during the 20th century. Michael Wex writes, \"As increasing numbers of Yiddish speakers moved from the Slavic-speaking East to Western Europe and the Americas in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, they were so quick to jettison Slavic vocabulary that the most prominent Yiddish writers of the time—the founders of modern Yiddish literature, who were still living in Slavic-speaking countries—revised the printed editions of their oeuvres to eliminate obsolete and 'unnecessary' Slavisms.\" The vocabulary used in Israel absorbed many Modern Hebrew words, and there was a similar but smaller increase in the English component of Yiddish in the United States and, to a lesser extent, the United Kingdom. This has resulted in some difficulty in communication between Yiddish speakers from Israel and those from other countries.\n\nYiddish phonology is similar to that of Standard German. However, it does not have final-obstruent devoicing and fortis (voiceless) stop consonants are unaspirated, and the phoneme is invariably uvular, unlike the German phoneme , which is palatal, velar, or uvular.\n\nYiddish has a smaller inventory of vowels than Standard German and no vowel length distinction.\n\nOn the eve of World War II, there were 11 to 13 million Yiddish speakers. The Holocaust, however, led to a dramatic, sudden decline in the use of Yiddish, as the extensive Jewish communities, both secular and religious, that used Yiddish in their day-to-day life, were largely destroyed. Around five million of those killed — 85 percent of the Jews who died in the Holocaust — were speakers of Yiddish. Although millions of Yiddish speakers survived the war (including nearly all Yiddish speakers in the Americas), further assimilation in countries such as the United States and the Soviet Union, along with the strictly monolingual stance of the Zionist movement, led to a decline in the use of Eastern Yiddish. However, the number of speakers within the widely dispersed Haredi (mainly Hasidic) communities is now increasing. Although used in various countries, Yiddish has attained official recognition as a minority language only in Moldova, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Netherlands, and Sweden.\n\nReports of the number of current Yiddish speakers vary significantly. \"Ethnologue\" estimates, based on publications through 1991, that there were at that time 1.5 million speakers of Eastern Yiddish, of which 40% lived in Ukraine, 15% in Israel, and 10% in the United States. The Modern Language Association agrees with fewer than 200,000 in the United States. Western Yiddish is reported by \"Ethnologue\" to have had an ethnic population of 50,000 in 2000, and an undated speaking population of 5,000, mostly in Germany. A 1996 report by the Council of Europe estimates a worldwide Yiddish-speaking population of about two million. Further demographic information about the recent status of what is treated as an Eastern–Western dialect continuum is provided in the YIVO \"Language and Cultural Atlas of Ashkenazic Jewry\" (Language and Cultural Atlas of Ashkenazic Jewry).\n\nThere has been frequent debate about the extent of the linguistic independence of Yiddish from the languages that it absorbed. There has been periodic assertion that Yiddish is a dialect of German, or even \"just broken German, more of a linguistic mishmash than a true language\". Even when recognized as an autonomous language, it has sometimes been referred to as Judeo-German, along the lines of other Jewish languages like Judeo-Persian, Judaeo-Spanish or Zarphatic. A widely cited summary of attitudes in the 1930s was published by Max Weinreich, quoting a remark by an auditor of one of his lectures: (\"a shprakh iz a dialekt mit an armey un flot\" — \"A language is a dialect with an army and navy\").\n\nThe national language of Israel is Hebrew. The debate in Zionist circles over the use of Yiddish in Israel and in the Diaspora in preference to Hebrew also reflected the tensions between religious and secular Jewish lifestyles. Many secular Zionists wanted Hebrew as the sole language of Jews, to contribute to a national cohesive identity. Traditionally religious Jews, on the other hand, preferred use of Yiddish, viewing Hebrew as a respected holy language reserved for prayer and religious study. In the early 20th century, Zionist activists in Palestine tried to eradicate the use of Yiddish among Jews in preference to Hebrew, and make its use socially unacceptable.\n\nThis conflict also reflected the opposing views among secular Jews worldwide, one side seeing Hebrew (and Zionism) and the other Yiddish (and Internationalism) as the means of defining Jewish nationalism. In the 1920s and 1930s, \"gdud maginéi hasafá\", \"the language defendants regiment\", whose motto was \" \"ivri, dabér ivrít\",\" that is, \"Hebrew [i.e. Jew], speak Hebrew!\", used to tear down signs written in \"foreign\" languages and disturb Yiddish theatre gatherings. However, according to linguist Ghil'ad Zuckermann, the members of this group in particular, and the Hebrew revival in general, did not succeed in uprooting Yiddish patterns (as well as the patterns of other European languages Jewish immigrants spoke) within what he calls \"Israeli\", i.e. Modern Hebrew. Zuckermann believes that \"Israeli does include numerous Hebrew elements resulting from a conscious revival but also numerous pervasive linguistic features deriving from a subconscious survival of the revivalists’ mother tongues, e.g. Yiddish.\"\n\nAfter the founding of the State of Israel, a massive wave of Jewish immigrants from Arab countries arrived. In short order, these Mizrahi Jews and their descendants would account for nearly half the Jewish population. While all were at least familiar with Hebrew as a liturgical language, essentially none had any contact with or affinity for Yiddish (some, of Sephardic origin, spoke Judaeo-Spanish, others various Judeo-Arabic languages). Thus, Hebrew emerged as the dominant linguistic common denominator between the different population groups.\n\nIn religious circles, it is the Ashkenazi Haredi Jews, particularly the Hasidic Jews and the Lithuanian yeshiva world (see Lithuanian Jews), who continue to teach, speak and use Yiddish, making it a language used regularly by hundreds of thousands of Haredi Jews today. The largest of these centers are in Bnei Brak and Jerusalem.\n\nThere is a growing revival of interest in Yiddish culture among secular Israelis, with the flourishing of new proactive cultural organizations like YUNG YiDiSH, as well as Yiddish theatre (usually with simultaneous translation to Hebrew and Russian) and young people are taking university courses in Yiddish, some achieving considerable fluency.\n\nIn the Soviet Union during the 1920s, Yiddish was promoted as the language of the Jewish proletariat.\nIt was one of the official languages of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. Until 1938, the Emblem of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic included the motto \"Workers of the world, unite!\" in Yiddish. Yiddish was also official language in several agricultural districts of the Galician Soviet Socialist Republic.\n\nA public educational system entirely based on the Yiddish language was established and comprised kindergartens, schools, and higher educational institutions (technical schools, rabfaks and other university departments). At the same time, Hebrew was considered a bourgeois language and its use was generally discouraged. The vast majority of the Yiddish-language cultural institutions were closed in the late 1930s, along with cultural institutions of other ethnic minorities lacking administrative entities of their own. The last Yiddish-language schools, theaters and publications were closed by the end of the 1940s. It continued to be spoken widely for decades, nonetheless, in areas with compact Jewish populations (primarily in Moldova, Ukraine, and to a lesser extent Belarus).\n\nIn the former Soviet states, recently active Yiddish authors include Yoysef Burg (Chernivtsi 1912–2009) and Olexander Beyderman (b. 1949, Odessa). Publication of an earlier Yiddish periodical ( - der fraynd; lit. \"The Friend\"), was resumed in 2004 with (\"der nayer fraynd\"; lit. \"The New Friend\", Saint Petersburg).\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, 1,683 people spoke Yiddish in Russia, approximately 1% of all the Jews of the Russian Federation. According to Mikhail Shvydkoy, former Minister of Culture of Russia and himself of Jewish origin, Yiddish culture in Russia is gone, and its revival is unlikely.\n\nThe Jewish Autonomous Oblast was formed in 1934 in the Russian Far East, with its capital city in Birobidzhan and Yiddish as its official language. The intention was for the Soviet Jewish population to settle there. Jewish cultural life was revived in Birobidzhan much earlier than elsewhere in the Soviet Union. Yiddish theaters began opening in the 1970s. The newspaper (\"Der Birobidzhaner Shtern\"; lit: \"The Birobidzhan Star\") includes a Yiddish section. Although the official status of the language was not retained by the Russian Federation, its cultural significance is still recognized and bolstered. The First Birobidzhan International Summer Program for Yiddish Language and Culture was launched in 2007.\n\n, according to data provided by the Russian Census Bureau, there were 97 speakers of Yiddish in the JAO.\n\nYiddish was an official language of the Ukrainian People's Republic (1917–1921).\n\nSeveral countries that ratified the 1992 European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages have included Yiddish in the list of their recognized minority languages: the Netherlands (1996), Sweden (2000), Romania (2008), Poland (2009), Bosnia and Herzegovina (2010). In 2005, Ukraine did not mention Yiddish as such, but \"the language(s) of the Jewish ethnic minority\".\n\nIn June 1999, the Swedish Parliament enacted legislation giving Yiddish legal status as one of the country's official minority languages (entering into effect in April 2000). The rights thereby conferred are not detailed, but additional legislation was enacted in June 2006 establishing a new governmental agency, The Swedish National Language Council, the mandate of which instructs it to \"collect, preserve, scientifically research, and spread material about the national minority languages\", naming them all explicitly, including Yiddish. When announcing this action, the government made an additional statement about \"simultaneously commencing completely new initiatives for... Yiddish [and the other minority languages]\".\n\nThe Swedish government publishes documents in Yiddish, of which the most recent details the national action plan for human rights. An earlier one provides general information about national minority language policies.\n\nOn 6 September 2007, it became possible to register Internet domains with Yiddish names in the national top-level domain .SE.\n\nThe first Jews were permitted to reside in Sweden during the late 18th century. The Jewish population in Sweden is estimated at around 20,000. Of these, according to various reports and surveys, between 2,000 and 6,000 claim to have at least some knowledge of Yiddish. In 2009, the number of native speakers among these was estimated by linguist Mikael Parkvall to be 750–1,500. It is believed that virtually all native speakers of Yiddish in Sweden today are adults, and most of them elderly.\n\nIn the United States, at first most Jews were of Sephardic origin, and hence did not speak Yiddish. It was not until the mid-to-late 19th century, as first German, then Eastern European, Jews arrived in the nation, that Yiddish became dominant within the immigrant community. This helped to bond Jews from many countries. (\"Forverts\" – \"The Forward\") was one of seven Yiddish daily newspapers in New York City, and other Yiddish newspapers served as a forum for Jews of all European backgrounds. In 1915, the circulation of the daily Yiddish newspapers was half a million in New York City alone, and 600,000 nationally. In addition, thousands more subscribed to the numerous weekly papers and the many magazines.\n\nThe typical circulation in the 21st century is a few thousand. The \"Forward\" still appears weekly and is also available in an online edition. It remains in wide distribution, together with (\"der algemeyner zhurnal\" – \"Algemeiner Journal\"; \"algemeyner\" = general), a Chabad newspaper which is also published weekly and appears online. The widest-circulation Yiddish newspapers are probably the weekly issues ( \"The Jew\"), (; \"blat\" \"paper\") and ( \"the newspaper\"). Several additional newspapers and magazines are in regular production, such as the weekly אידישער טריביון \"Yiddish Tribune\" and the monthly publications (\"Der Shtern\" \"The Star\") and (\"Der Blik\" \"The View\"). (The romanized titles cited in this paragraph are in the form given on the masthead of each publication and may be at some variance both with the literal Yiddish title and the transliteration rules otherwise applied in this article.) Thriving Yiddish theater, especially in the New York City Yiddish Theatre District, kept the language vital. Interest in klezmer music provided another bonding mechanism.\n\nMost of the Jewish immigrants to the New York metropolitan area during the years of Ellis Island considered Yiddish their native language; however, native Yiddish speakers tended not to pass the language on to their children, who assimilated and spoke English. For example, Isaac Asimov states in his autobiography \"In Memory Yet Green\" that Yiddish was his first and sole spoken language, and remained so for about two years after he emigrated to the United States as a small child. By contrast, Asimov's younger siblings, born in the United States, never developed any degree of fluency in Yiddish.\n\nMany \"Yiddishisms\", like \"Italianisms\" and \"Spanishisms\", entered New York City English, often used by Jews and non-Jews alike, unaware of the linguistic origin of the phrases. Yiddish words used in English were documented extensively by Leo Rosten in \"The Joys of Yiddish\"; see also the list of English words of Yiddish origin.\n\nIn 1975, the film \"Hester Street\", much of which is in Yiddish, was released. It was later chosen to be on the Library of Congress National Film Registry for being considered a \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" film.\n\nIn 1976, the Canadian-born American author Saul Bellow received the Nobel Prize in Literature. He was fluent in Yiddish, and translated several Yiddish poems and stories into English, including Isaac Bashevis Singer's \"Gimpel the Fool\".\n\nIn 1978, Isaac Bashevis Singer, a writer in the Yiddish language, who was born in Poland and lived in the United States, received the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nLegal scholars Eugene Volokh and Alex Kozinski argue that Yiddish is \"supplanting Latin as the spice in American legal argot\".\n\nIn the 2000 United States Census, 178,945 people in the United States reported speaking Yiddish at home. Of these speakers, 113,515 lived in New York (63.43% of American Yiddish speakers); 18,220 in Florida (10.18%); 9,145 in New Jersey (5.11%); and 8,950 in California (5.00%). The remaining states with speaker populations larger than 1,000 are Pennsylvania (5,445), Ohio (1,925), Michigan (1,945), Massachusetts (2,380), Maryland (2,125), Illinois (3,510), Connecticut (1,710), and Arizona (1,055). The population is largely elderly: 72,885 of the speakers were older than 65, 66,815 were between 18 and 64, and only 39,245 were age 17 or lower.\nIn the six years since the 2000 census, the 2006 American Community Survey reflected an estimated 15 percent decline of people speaking Yiddish at home in the U.S. to 152,515. In 2011, the number of persons in the United States above the age of 5 speaking Yiddish at home was 160,968.\n\nThere are a few predominantly Hasidic communities in the United States in which Yiddish remains the majority language including concentrations in the Crown Heights, Borough Park, and Williamsburg neighborhoods of Brooklyn. In Kiryas Joel in Orange County, New York, in the 2000 census, nearly 90% of residents of Kiryas Joel reported speaking Yiddish at home.\n\nThere are well over 30,000 Yiddish speakers in the United Kingdom, and several thousand children now have Yiddish as a first language. The largest group of Yiddish speakers in Britain reside in the Stamford Hill district of North London, but there are sizable communities in northwest London, Leeds, Manchester and Gateshead. The Yiddish readership in the UK is mainly reliant upon imported material from the United States and Israel for newspapers, magazines and other periodicals. However, the London-based weekly \"Jewish Tribune\" has a small section in Yiddish called \"Yidishe Tribune\". From the 1910s to the 1950s, London had a daily Yiddish newspaper called די צײַט (\"Di Tsayt\", ; in English, \"The Time\"), founded, and edited from offices in Whitechapel Road, by Roumanian-born Morris Myer, who was succeeded on his death in 1943 by his son Harry. There were also from time to time Yiddish newspapers in Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow and Leeds.\n\nMontreal had, and to some extent still has, one of the most thriving Yiddish communities in North America. Yiddish was Montreal's third language (after French and English) for the entire first half of the twentieth century. \"Der Keneder Adler\" (\"The Canadian Eagle\", founded by Hirsch Wolofsky), Montreal’s daily Yiddish newspaper, appeared from 1907 to 1988. The Monument-National was the center of Yiddish theater from 1896 until the construction of the Saidye Bronfman Centre for the Arts (now the Segal Centre for Performing Arts), inaugurated on September 24, 1967, where the established resident theater, the Dora Wasserman Yiddish Theatre, remains the only permanent Yiddish theatre in North America. The theatre group also tours Canada, US, Israel, and Europe.\n\nEven though Yiddish has receded, it is the immediate ancestral language of Montrealers like Mordecai Richler, Leonard Cohen as well as former interim city mayor Michael Applebaum. Besides Yiddish-speaking activists, it remains today the native everyday language of 15,000 Montreal Hassidim.\n\nThe major exception to the decline of spoken Yiddish can be found in Haredi communities all over the world. In some of the more closely knit such communities, Yiddish is spoken as a home and schooling language, especially in Hasidic, Litvish, or Yeshivish communities, such as Brooklyn's Borough Park, Williamsburg, and Crown Heights, and in the communities of Monsey, Kiryas Joel, and New Square in New York (over 88% of the population of Kiryas Joel is reported to speak Yiddish at home.) Also in New Jersey, Yiddish is widely spoken mostly in Lakewood Township, but also in smaller towns with yeshivas, such as Passaic, Teaneck, and elsewhere. Yiddish is also widely spoken in the Jewish community in Antwerp, and in Haredi communities such as the ones in London, Manchester, and Montreal. Yiddish is also spoken in many Haredi communities throughout Israel. Among most Ashkenazi Haredim, Hebrew is generally reserved for prayer, while Yiddish is used for religious studies, as well as a home and business language. In Israel, however, Haredim commonly speak Hebrew, with the notable exception of many Hasidic communities. However, many Haredim who use Modern Hebrew also understand Yiddish. There are some who send their children to schools in which the primary language of instruction is Yiddish. Members of anti-Zionist Haredi groups such as the Satmar Hasidim, who view the commonplace use of Hebrew as a form of Zionism, use Yiddish almost exclusively.\n\nHundreds of thousands of young children around the globe have been, and are still, taught to translate the texts of the Torah into Yiddish. This process is called (\"taytshn\") – \"translating\". Most Ashkenazi yeshivas' highest level lectures in Talmud and Halakha are delivered in Yiddish by the rosh yeshivas as well as ethical talks of the Musar movement. Hasidic rebbes generally use only Yiddish to converse with their followers and to deliver their various Torah talks, classes, and lectures. The linguistic style and vocabulary of Yiddish have influenced the manner in which many Orthodox Jews who attend yeshivas speak English. This usage is distinctive enough that it has been dubbed \"Yeshivish\".\n\nWhile Hebrew remains the exclusive language of Jewish prayer, the Hasidim have mixed some Yiddish into their Hebrew, and are also responsible for a significant secondary religious literature written in Yiddish. For example, the tales about the Baal Shem Tov were written largely in Yiddish. The Torah Talks of the late Chabad leaders are published in their original form, Yiddish. In addition, some prayers, such as \"God of Abraham\", were composed and are recited in Yiddish.\n\nThere has been a resurgence in Yiddish learning in recent times among many from around the world with Jewish ancestry. The language which had lost many of its native speakers during WWII has been making somewhat of a comeback. In Poland, which traditionally had Yiddish speaking communities, a museum has begun to revive Yiddish education and culture. Located in Kraków, the Galicia Jewish Museum offers classes in Yiddish Language Instruction and workshops on Yiddish Songs. The museum has taken steps to revive the culture through concerts and events held on site.\nThere are various Universities worldwide which now offer Yiddish programs based on the YIVO Yiddish standard. Many of these programs are held during the summer and are attended by Yiddish enthusiasts from around the world. One such school located within Vilnius University (Vilnius Yiddish Institute) was the first Yiddish center of higher learning to be established in post-Holocaust Eastern Europe. Vilnius Yiddish Institute is an integral part of the four-century-old Vilnius University. Published Yiddish scholar and researcher Dovid Katz is among the Faculty.\n\nDespite this growing popularity among many American Jews, finding opportunities for practical use of Yiddish is becoming increasingly difficult, and thus many students have trouble learning to speak the language. One solution has been the establishment of a farm in Goshen, New York for Yiddishists.\n\nGoogle Translate includes Yiddish as one of its languages, as does Wikipedia. Hebrew alphabet keyboards are available and right-to-left writing recognised. Google search accepts queries in Yiddish.\n\nOver ten thousand Yiddish texts, estimated as over half of all the published works in Yiddish, are now online based on the work of the Yiddish Book Center, volunteers, and the Internet Archive.\n\nMany websites on the Internet are in Yiddish. In January 2013, \"The Forward\" announced the launch of the new daily version of their newspaper's website, which has been active since 1999 as an online weekly, supplied with radio and video programs, a literary section for fiction writers and a special blog written in local contemporary Hasidic dialects.\n\nComputer scientist Raphael Finkel maintains a hub of Yiddish-language resources, including a searchable dictionary and spell checker.\n\nIn late 2016, Motorola, Inc. released its smartphones with keyboard access for the Yiddish language in its foreign language option.\n\nHere is a short example of the Yiddish language with standard German as a comparison. \n\nEnglish \n\nAll human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.\n\nYiddish \n\nיעדער מענטש װערט געבױרן פֿרײַ און גלײַך אין כּבֿוד און רעכט. יעדער װערט באַשאָנקן מיט פֿאַרשטאַנד און געװיסן; יעדער זאָל זיך פֿירן מיט אַ צװײטן אין אַ געמיט פֿון ברודערשאַפֿט. \n\nYeder mentsh vert geboyrn fray un glaykh in koved un rekht. Yeder vert bashonkn mit farshtand un gevisn; yeder zol zikh firn mit a tsveytn in a gemit fun brudershaft.\n\nGerman \n\nAlle Menschen sind frei und gleich an Würde und Rechten geboren. Sie sind mit Vernunft und Gewissen begabt und sollen einander im Geist der Brüderlichkeit begegnen.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "29812528", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29812528", "title": "Yoke thé", "text": "Yoke thé\n\nYoke thé (, , literally \"miniatures\") is the Burmese name for marionette puppetry. Although the term can be used for marionettery in general, its usage usually refers to the local form of string puppetry. Like most of Burmese refined art, \"yoke thé\" performances originated from royal patronage and were gradually adapted for the wider populace. \"Yoke thé\" are almost always performed in operas.\n\nBurmese marionettes are very intricate and dexterous as they employ 18 or 19 wires for male and female characters respectively, and each puppet is controlled by only one puppeteer.\n\nThe probable date of the origin of Burmese marionettes is given as around 1780 during the reign of Singu Min, and their introduction is credited to the Minister of Royal Entertainment, U Thaw. From their inception, marionettes grew in popularity in the courts of the Konbaung dynasty. Little has changed since the creation of the art by U Thaw, and the set of characters developed by him is in use today. Until the conquest of Upper Burma by the British in late 1885 during the Third Anglo-Burmese War, \"yoke thé\" troupes thrived under royal patronage.\n\nA Burmese marionette troupe has 27 character figures.\n\nA traditional Burmese orchestra known as a \"hsaing waing\" usually provides the music. The puppeteers themselves often provide the voices of the characters.\n\nThe Burmese court was concerned with preserving the dignity of its members, and marionettes were often used to preserve the esteem of persons who had erred. The king could reprimand his children or his wife in this way by asking the puppeteers to put on a parable warning errant children or careless wives about their reckless ways. While the reprimand would be obvious to anyone who was in the know, it would largely pass unheeded by the people looking on, something that had a great deal of value in a court that could, and did, contain hundreds of people.\n\nBurmese marionettes also served as a conduit between the ruler and his subjects. Many times, people would ask the puppeteers to mention in a veiled fashion a current event or warning to the ruler. Thus, information or popular discontent could be transferred on without any disrespect, as marionettes could say things that a human could be punished for with death.\n\n\"Yoke thé\" troupes, like most artisans in pre-colonial Burma alongside the Sangha, enjoyed great royal patronage. However, like most forms of traditional artwork, the support dried up upon the colonisation of Upper Burma by the British in November 1885 following the Third Anglo-Burmese War.\n\nIn the late 1990s, General Khin Nyunt of the ruling junta lent official support to marionette actors and troupes, reviving a rapidly dying tradition. Nowadays, marionettes are very common in tourist attractions and also amongst the populace, and they have resumed their role of relatively safe political satire reflecting popular discontent.\n\nA new genre of \"yoke thé\" is emerging where a character and a real life actor perform the same feat, usually with the \"yoke thé\" puppets able to mimic and sometimes out-perform their human counterparts.\n\n"}
