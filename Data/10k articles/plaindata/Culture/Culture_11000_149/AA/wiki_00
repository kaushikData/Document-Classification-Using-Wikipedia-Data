It originated with an unsupported claim of a \"statistical spike\" for the death of musicians at that age, but this has been repeatedly disproved by research.\n\nIt remains a cultural meme, documenting the deaths of celebrities, some noted for their high-risk lifestyles. Names are often put forward for inclusion, but because the club is entirely notional, there is no official membership.\n\nThe 27 Club is a list of popular musicians, artists, actors and athletes who have died at age 27, often as a result of drug and alcohol abuse, or violent means such as homicide, suicide, or transportation-related accidents. The deaths of several 27 year-old popular musicians between 1969 and 1971 led to the belief that deaths are more common at this age. Statistical studies have failed to find any unusual pattern of musician deaths at this age, comparing it to equally small increases at ages 25 and 32, with a 2011 \"BMJ\" study noting instead that young adult musicians have a higher death rate than the rest of the young adult population, concluding: \"Fame may increase the risk of death among musicians, but this risk is not limited to age 27\".\n\nThe \"club\" has been repeatedly cited in music magazines, journals and the daily press. Several exhibitions have been devoted to the idea, as well as novels, films and stage plays. There have been many different theories and speculations about the causes of such early deaths and their possible connections. Cobain and Hendrix biographer Charles R. Cross wrote, four years before the \"BMJ\" study was published, \"The number of musicians who died at 27 is truly remarkable by any standard. [Although] humans die regularly at all ages, there is a statistical spike for musicians who die at 27.\"\n\nBrian Jones, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Jim Morrison all died at the age of 27 between 1969 and 1971. At the time, the coincidence gave rise to some comment, but it was not until the 1994 death of Kurt Cobain at age 27, that the idea of a \"27 Club\" began to catch on in public perception.\n\nAccording to Hendrix and Cobain biographer Charles R. Cross, the growing importance of the media—Internet, television and magazines—and the response to an interview of Cobain's mother were jointly responsible for such theories. An excerpt from a statement that Cobain's mother, Wendy Fradenburg Cobain O'Connor, made in the Aberdeen, Washington, newspaper \"The Daily World\"—\"Now he's gone and joined that stupid club. I told him not to join that stupid club.\"—referred to Hendrix, Joplin, and Morrison dying at the same age, according to Cross. Other authors share his view. On the other hand, Eric Segalstad, writer of \"\", assumed that Cobain's mother referred to the death of his two uncles and his great-uncle, all of whom had also committed suicide. According to Cross, the events have led a \"set of conspiracy theorists [to suggest] the absurd notion that Kurt Cobain intentionally timed his death so he could join the 27 Club\".\n\nIn 2011, seventeen years after Cobain's death, Amy Winehouse died at the age of 27, prompting a renewed swell of media attention devoted to the club once again. Three years earlier, she had expressed a fear of dying at that age.\n\nAn individual does not necessarily have to be a musician to qualify as a member of the 27 Club. \"Rolling Stone\" included television actor Jonathan Brandis, who committed suicide in 2003, in a list of \"members\" of the 27 Club. Anton Yelchin, who had played in a punk rock band but was primarily known as a film actor, was also described as a member of the club upon his death in 2016. Likewise, Jean-Michel Basquiat has been included in 27 Club lists, despite the relative brevity of his music career and his prominence as a graffiti artist and painter.\n\nA study published in the \"British Medical Journal\" in December 2011 concluded that there was no increase in the risk of death for musicians at the age of 27. Although the sampled musicians faced an increased risk of death in their 20s and 30s, this was not limited to the age of 27. A 2015 article in \"The Independent\" also provided statistical evidence that popular musicians are not more likely to die at the age of 27.\n\nThe theme is referenced in the song \"27 Forever\" by Eric Burdon, on his 2013 album \"'Til Your River Runs Dry\".\n\nThe name of the song \"27 Club\" by letlive. off their album \"The Blackest Beautiful\" is derived from the club.\n\nMagenta's eighth studio album, \"The Twenty Seven Club\", directly references the club. Each track is a tribute to a member of the club.\n\nThe song title \"27\" by Fall Out Boy from their album \"Folie à Deux\" is a reference to the club. The song explores the hedonistic lifestyles common in rock and roll. Pete Wentz, the primary lyricist of Fall Out Boy, wrote the song because he felt that he was living a similarly dangerous lifestyle.\n\nOn his song \"Brand Name\" from the album \"\", Mac Miller says \"To everyone who sell me drugs, don't mix it with that bullshit, I'm hoping not to join the twenty-seven club.\" Miller himself died on September 7, 2018, at the age of 26. His autopsy revealed that cause of death was an accidental overdose of fentanyl, cocaine and alcohol.\n\nThe song \"Colors\" by Halsey references the club with the lyric, \"I hope you make it to the day you're 28 years old\".\n\nRapper Watsky references the club on his song \"All You Can Do\" with the lyric \"I tried to join the 27 Club, they kicked me out.\" The song then goes on to reference some famous members of the club, namely Amy Winehouse, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Kurt Cobain, Jim Morrison, and Brian Jones.\n\nThe song \"27 Club\" by Ivy Levan released as a promotional single for her debut album \"No Good\" released in 2015 is a reference to the club.\n\n\"Uno\" by Rex Orange County refers to the club in the last line of the song; \"And every now and then I think about the fact that I'd become a legend if I died at 27.\"\n\nAdore Delano released a song called \"27 Club\" in her third studio album \"Whatever\" (2017). Delano was 27 years at the time of release.\n\n"}

The film is a feature-length adaptation of his 2012 Oscar-winning short film, \"Curfew\". The film had its world premiere at South by Southwest Film on March 10, 2014. The film was acquired for distribution by IFC Films on August 5, 2014 and released on November 28, 2014.\n\nIn New York City, Richie (Shawn Christensen), a downtrodden young man whose girlfriend, Vista (Isabelle McNally), recently disappeared, discovers the corpse of a girl who died from a heroin overdose while he is cleaning bathroom stalls at a nightclub. The club owner, Bill (Ron Perlman), arranges for her body to be removed without notifying the authorities.\n\nAt his apartment, Richie attempts suicide by cutting one of his wrists in a bathtub, when he receives a call from his estranged sister, Maggie (Emmy Rossum), asking him to look after her eleven-year-old daughter, Sophia (Fátima Ptacek). Richie goes to her school, where she recites \"Because I could not stop for Death\" by Emily Dickinson in both English and Mandarin Chinese. Richie takes her to her apartment before heading home, where he attempts suicide by drug overdose. Richie hallucinates a drug dealer calling him on the phone, threatening him by saying he is in the building. Sophia calls, however, and informs Richie that her mother has not returned home.\n\nRichie arrives at the lobby of Maggie's apartment, where he discovers that the drugs he took were Zolafren, intended for menopause. Outside Maggie's apartment, a suspicious-looking woman asks Richie about his sister's whereabouts. After entering, Maggie calls the apartment, indicating to Richie that she is in central booking and upon hearing of the woman, orders Richie to sneak Sophia out of the building.\n\nRichie takes Sophia to a bowling alley where he works. Richie calls central booking, who inform him that his sister was arrested and is awaiting arraignment at 4:30 AM. The owner of the bowling alley, Gideon (Paul Wesley), has Richie brought to the office. Gideon informs him that his girlfriend has been missing for a day, with her last whereabouts being at Bill's nightclub, and produces a photograph, which Richie recognizes as being of the dead woman he saw the night before. Richie denies knowledge of her whereabouts. He calls Bill, who tells him to come in at 1:30 AM to discuss the situation.\n\nAs a favor to Richie, Gideon allows Maggie the use of his lawyer, Bruce Warham (Richard Schiff), who informs Maggie that in the public's eyes, she is a mistress, due to her having sexual relations to a married man, despite having been assaulted.\n\nRichie tells Sophia about flip books he made growing up about a character called \"Sophia\". He brings Sophia to his former apartment in a downtrodden part of town, where he retrieves some flip books and calms his panicked niece by presenting the premise of a girl who dies in intricate ways, but comes back by the next installment. He then collapses from blood loss, but refuses to go to a hospital, due to promising Maggie to keep Sophia safe.\n\nAfter Sophia tells him the cruel things her estranged father, Darren (Fran Kranz), says to her, Richie assaults him at his work. Richie and Sophia visit Bill, who divulges that Gideon's girlfriend had been resisting his advances and in retaliation, he gave her heroin. Richie returns to Maggie's apartment, where he returns Sophia home. Sophia tells him that his constant love letters to Vista would work if he told her he loves her.\n\nHaving reached an epiphany, Richie confronts Gideon, telling him what happened to his girlfriend. Gideon and his armed thugs abduct Richie, then drop him off alongside the road, before speeding off to deal with Bill. Richie re-encounters the blonde woman, who is revealed to be the wife of Maggie's lover. Richie makes his rendezvous with a released Maggie and escorts her to her apartment.\n\nMaggie tells Richie that she does not want him to stay in her daughter's life, fearing him to be a \"false idol\". Richie tells her how much he looked up to her when they were younger and how much he still looks up to her now. He returns to his bathtub and prepares to kill himself, when Maggie calls him, inviting him over for dinner. Richie writes a much shorter letter to Vista, stating that he loves and misses her, before looking up and seeing an image of her sitting across from him.\n\n\n\"Before I Disappear\" had its worldwide premiere at South by Southwest (SXSW) on March 11, 2014, where it won the Audience Award and was nominated for the Grand Jury Award. Following SXSW, the film was shown at a handful of festivals, including the 71st Venice International Film Festival, where it was the only American film that was selected for the Venice Days program. IFC Films was announced to have acquired the American distribution rights to \"Before I Disappear\" on August 5, 2014. IFC gave the film a limited theatrical release on November 28, 2014.\n\nSimultaneous with the home media distribution of \"Before I Disappear\", IFC released the film on November 28, 2014 on video on demand via Amazon.com and iTunes. The film was released on DVD and Netflix on May 19, 2015.\n\nThe film opened on November 28, 2014 in one theater and on select VOD platforms. As of August 2016, it earned $10,078 from five screens.\n\nThe film won the South by Southwest Audience Award and was in competition at the Venice Film Festival.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes it holds a 38% rating based on 29 critic reviews and an average rating of 6.2/10. Metacritic gives the film a rating of 47/100 based on 13 critic reviews.\n\nMoviefone called it \"visually daring, nearly wondrous, and might be the best late night New York movie since Martin Scorsese's After Hours.\nJustin Chang of \"Variety\" called it \"visually well mounted, but too overwrought to really convince or resonate\".\nEric Kohn of Indiewire rated it B− and wrote that the film \"contains all the strong moments that distinguished \"Curfew\" while surrounding them with a lot of superfluous additions\". Mark Adams of \"Screen Daily\" described it as \"a stylish and beautifully shot adaptation, strong on performance and a nicely nuanced script, but in the end perhaps lacking an expanded story to suit its feature length.\" David Rooney of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" wrote a negative review, in which he criticized the writing and flow of the film as being sporadic, but gave credit to the performances of the actors.\n\n"}
{"id": "8028998", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8028998", "title": "Bengali phonology", "text": "Bengali phonology\n\nThe Bengali phonology is, like that of its neighbouring Eastern Indo-Aryan languages, characterised by a wide variety of diphthongs and inherent back vowel (both and ) instead of the schwa used by almost all other branches of the Indo-Aryan language family.\n\nPhonemically, Bengali features 29 consonants and 14 or 15 vowels (Eastern dialects incorporate an additional vowel featured in a vowel harmony process), including seven nasalized vowels. In the tables below, the sounds are given in IPA.\n\nAlthough the standard form of Bengali is largely uniform across West Bengal and Bangladesh, there are a few sounds that vary in pronunciation (in addition to the myriad variations in non-standard dialects):\n\n\nThe murmured series is missing in the Eastern Bengali of Dhaka and in Chittagong Bengali, where it is replaced by tone, as in Panjabi.\n\nNative Bengali ( \"tôdbhôbo\") words do not allow initial consonant clusters; the maximum syllabic structure is CVC (i.e. one vowel flanked by a consonant on each side). Many speakers of Bengali restrict their phonology to this pattern, even when using Sanskrit or English borrowings, such as \"geram\" (CV.CVC) for \"gram\" (CCVC) meaning 'village' or \"iskul\" / \"ishkul\" (VC.CVC) for \"skul\" (CCVC) 'school'.\n\nSanskrit ( \"tôtshômo\") words borrowed into Bengali, however, possess a wide range of clusters, expanding the maximum syllable structure to CCCVC. Some of these clusters, such as the in \"mrittü\" ('death') or the in \"spôshṭo\" ('clear'), have become extremely common, and can be considered permitted consonant clusters in Bengali. English and other foreign ( \"bideshi\") borrowings add even more cluster types into the Bengali inventory, further increasing the syllable capacity, as commonly-used loanwords such as \"ṭren\" ('train') and \"glash\" ('glass') are now included in leading Bengali dictionaries.\n\nFinal consonant clusters are rare in Bengali. Most final consonant clusters were borrowed into Bengali from English, as in \"lifṭ\" ('elevator') and \"beņk\" (\"bank'). However, final clusters do exist in some native Bengali words, although rarely in standard pronunciation. One example of a final cluster in a standard Bengali word would be \"gônj\", which is found in names of hundreds of cities and towns across Bengal, including \"Nôbabgônj\" and \"Manikgônj\". Some nonstandard varieties of Bengali make use of final clusters quite often. For example, in some Purbo (eastern) dialects, final consonant clusters consisting of a nasal and its corresponding oral stop are common, as in \"chand\" ('moon'). The Standard Bengali equivalent of \"chand\" would be \"chãd\", with a nasalized vowel instead of the final cluster.\n\nMagadhan languages such as Bengali are known for their wide variety of diphthongs, or combinations of vowels occurring within the same syllable. Several vowel combinations can be considered true monosyllabic diphthongs, made up of the main vowel (the nucleus) and the trailing vowel (the off-glide). Almost all other vowel combinations are possible, but only across two adjacent syllables, such as the disyllabic vowel combination in \"kua\" ('well'). As many as 25 vowel combinations can be found, but some of the more recent combinations have not passed through the stage between two syllables and a diphthongal monosyllable.\n\nIn standard Bengali, stress is predominantly initial. Bengali words are virtually all trochaic; the primary stress falls on the initial syllable of the word, while secondary stress often falls on all odd-numbered syllables thereafter, giving strings such as \"shôhojogita\" ('cooperation'). The first syllable carries the greatest stress, with the third carrying a somewhat weaker stress, and all following odd-numbered syllables carrying very weak stress. However, in words borrowed from Sanskrit, the root syllable has stress, out of harmony with the situation with native Bengali words. Also, in a declarative sentence, the stress is generally lowest on the last word of the sentence.\n\nAdding prefixes to a word typically shifts the stress to the left; for example, while the word \"shobbho\" ('civilized') carries the primary stress on the first syllable, adding the negative prefix creates \"ôshobbho\" ('uncivilized'), where the primary stress is now on the newly added first syllable \"ô\". Word-stress does not alter the meaning of a word and is always subsidiary to sentence-level stress.\n\nFor Bengali words, intonation or pitch of voice have minor significance, apart from a few cases such as distinguishing between identical vowels in a diphthong. However, in sentences intonation does play a significant role. In a simple declarative sentence, most words and/or phrases in Bengali carry a rising tone, with the exception of the last word in the sentence, which only carries a low tone. This intonational pattern creates a musical tone to the typical Bengali sentence, with low and high tones alternating until the final drop in pitch to mark the end of the sentence.\n\nIn sentences involving focused words and/or phrases, the rising tones only last until the focused word; all following words carry a low tone. This intonation pattern extends to wh-questions, as wh-words are normally considered to be focused. In yes-no questions, the rising tones may be more exaggerated, and most importantly, the final syllable of the final word in the sentence takes a high falling tone instead of a flat low tone.\n\nLike most Magadhan languages, vowel length is not contrastive in Bengali; all else equal, there is no meaningful distinction between a \"short vowel\" and a \"long vowel\", unlike the situation in most Indo-Aryan languages. However, when morpheme boundaries come into play, vowel length can sometimes distinguish otherwise homophonous words. This is because open monosyllables (i.e. words that are made up of only one syllable, with that syllable ending in the main vowel and not a consonant) can have somewhat longer vowels than other syllable types. For example, the vowel in \"ca\" ('tea') can be somewhat longer than the first vowel in \"caṭa\" ('licking'), as \"ca\" is a word with only one syllable, and no final consonant. The suffix \"ṭa\" ('the') can be added to \"ca\" to form \"caṭa\" ('the tea'), and the long vowel is preserved, creating a minimal pair ( vs. . Knowing this fact, some interesting cases of apparent vowel length distinction can be found. In general, Bengali vowels tend to stay away from extreme vowel articulation.\n\nFurthermore, using a form of reduplication called \"echo reduplication\", the long vowel in \"ca\" can be copied into the reduplicant \"ṭa\", giving \"caṭa\" ('tea and all that comes with it'). Thus, in addition to \"caṭa\" ('the tea') with a longer first vowel and \"caṭa\" ('licking') with no long vowels, we have \"caṭa\" ('tea and all that comes with it') with two longer vowels.\n\nThe phonological alternations of Bengali vary greatly due to the dialectal differences between the speech of Bengalis living on the \"Poschim\" (western) side and \"Purbo\" (eastern) side of the Padma River.\n\nIn the dialects prevalent in much of eastern Bangladesh (Barisal, Chittagong, Dhaka and Sylhet divisions), many of the stops and affricates heard in Kolkata Bengali are pronounced as fricatives.\n\nThe aspirated velar stop and the aspirated labial stop of Poshcim Bengali correspond to and or in many dialects of Purbo Bengali. These pronunciations are most extreme in the Sylheti dialect of far northeastern Bangladesh—the dialect of Bengali most common in the United Kingdom.\n\nMany Purbo Bengali dialects share phonological features with Assamese, including the debuccalization of to or and the pronunciation of and .\n\nThe influence of Tibeto-Burman languages on the phonology is mostly on the Bengali spoken in east of the Padma River and relatively less in West and South Bengal as is seen through the lack of nasalized vowels in eastern Bengal but nasalization being present in Indian Bengali and an alveolar articulation for the otherwise postalveolar stops , , , and , resembling the equivalent phonemes in languages such as Thai and Lao. In the phonology of West and Southern Bengal, the distinction between and is clear and distinct like neighbouring Indian languages. But in the far-eastern variants where there is Tibeto-Burman influence, the distinction becomes less clear and sometimes becomes similar to the phonology of the Assamese ৰ rô. Unlike most languages of the region, Purbo Bengali dialects tend not to distinguish aspirated voiced stops , , , , and from their unaspirated equivalents, with some dialects treating them as allophones of each other and other dialects replacing the former with the latter completely. Some variants of Bengali, particularly Chittagonian and Chakma Bengali, have contrastive tone; differences in the pitch of the speaker's voice can distinguish words. There is also a distinction between and in many northern Bangladeshi dialects. representing the uncommon to Bengali sound whereas the standard used for both letters in most other dialects.\n\n"}

Preparing a bill of quantities requires that the design is complete and a specification has been prepared.\nThe bill of quantities is issued to tenderers for them to prepare a price for carrying out the construction work. The bill of quantities assists tenderers in the calculation of construction costs for their tender, and, as it means all tendering contractors will be pricing the same quantities (rather than taking-off quantities from the drawings and specifications themselves), it also provides a fair and accurate system for tendering\n\nBills of quantities are prepared by quantity surveyors and building estimators, and \"Indeed the bill of quantities was the reason for the development of quantity surveying as a separate profession.\"\nCOBRA The international operations or trades used in construction.\nAs the rates for materials and labour change due to inflation, these books are frequently republished..\n\nThe practice historically of estimating building costs in this way arose from non-contractual measurements, taken off drawings to assist tenderers in quoting lump sum prices.\n\nThere are different styles of bills of quantities, mainly the Elemental BOQ and Trade Bills.\n\nA Contingency sum is an item found within a Bill of quantities (BoQ).\n\nThe item refers to unforeseeable cost likely to be incurred during the contract.\n\nThere are two types of contingency sum.

{"id": "5339355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5339355", "title": "Blood &amp; Orchids", "text": "Blood &amp; Orchids\n\nBlood & Orchids is a 1986 made-for-TV crime-drama film. Written for the screen by Norman Katkov, it was an adaptation of Katkov's own novel which, in turn, was inspired by the 1932 Massie Trial in Honolulu, Hawaii. It was typical of many crime dramas produced during the period.\n\nIn 1937 Hawaii, four native Hawaiian men find a white woman, beaten nearly to death, and take her to a hospital—only to be charged later with her rape and assault. During their trial, the woman's husband, a lieutenant in the US Navy, fatally shoots one of them and later stands trial himself. The trial brings into stark relief the racial tensions that tear at the social fabric of Territorial Hawaii in the years prior to World War II.\n\nSocialite Hester Ashley Murdoch (Madeleine Stowe) leaves an officers' dinner party at the US Naval base in Honolulu in the company of a man who is not her husband (Lieutenant Lloyd Murdoch, played by William Russ), but rather Lt. Murdoch's best friend. The friend coldly announces that he is terminating their relationship, though Hester is carrying his child. Outraged, she announces that she will tell her husband and the commanding admiral on the station. In retaliation, the friend beats her savagely and leaves her bloodied and battered where she lies.\n\nFour young Hawaiian men find her and take her to a hospital, although they fear being blamed for the condition she is in because she is \"haole\" (white) and they are native Hawaiian. At the hospital, Hester's mother Doris (Jane Alexander) assumes that the Hawaiians are to blame, but Hester says, \"It's nobody's fault; I was the pregnant one!\" The shocked Doris tells her daughter that she must collaborate in Doris' campaign to blame the Hawaiians, saying that Hester must think of Doris' \"position\" in high society. Accordingly, the four are charged with rape and assault, although the only sexual intercourse that Hester had was consensual and not with any of the four.\n\nMost of the law-enforcement officers involved, including the Honolulu Police Department and the Navy Shore Patrol, assume that the Hawaiians are guilty, but Detective Captain Curt Maddox (Kris Kristofferson) is unconvinced. Meanwhile, the Hawaiians get a court-appointed attorney who strives valiantly to show that the four must be innocent of the crime, because of time-line conflicts with the best estimate of when the beating took place.\nThe trial of the four ends abruptly and tragically, though, when Lieutenant Murdoch, at the height of an at-the-bench discussion between the judge and the two opposing counsels, abruptly draws his service automatic and shoots the lead defendant twice in the head, killing him.\n\nNow Murdoch must stand trial (in a civilian court) for murder in the first degree. Doris sends a wire to famed criminal attorney Walter Bergmann (Jose Ferrer), who agrees to defend Lieutenant Murdoch against the murder charge. The pretrial investigation is complicated by an affair between Detective Maddox and Mr. Bergmann's wife Leonore (Sean Young).\n\nThe case is further complicated when a number of Navy petty officers, all friends of Murdoch, kidnap the three remaining Hawaiians, tie them in spread-eagle fashion to an improvised rack, and beat them to get them to confess to the original alleged rape and assault. In the course of that particular atrocity, the Navy men repeatedly use the expression \"bilge\", which (at least according to the film) is common Navy slang for useless information or known falsehood. The lawyer for the Hawaiians interviews the three, after they are brought to a hospital and unable to lie on their backs because of the severe beatings they have received. There, they finally blurt out, \"They said, 'Bilge!'\" This gives the lawyer the vital clues he needs. Maddox follows up the clues and has the three arrested.\n\nMurdoch's trial climaxes with Attorney Bergmann trying to sum up by saying that Murdoch's action was excusable. \"Those animals beat her!\" he cries; then Hester, plagued by her conscience, blurts out, \"They're innocent! They're innocent!\" Although Bergmann roughly escorts her from the courtroom, the damage is done: Murdoch is convicted.\n\nSubsequently, Doris engages in a behavior called \"brazening it out\". She hires an interior decorator to redecorate her home. In the middle of her interview with the decorator, Detective Maddox arrives with a warrant for the arrests of Doris and Hester. Hester, crushed, rushes to her bathroom and hangs herself from the shower head. Doris discovers Hester's dead body and cries out in anguish, although whether that anguish is truly for losing her daughter or because this is the final shameful and devastating blow to her social position, the film leaves unresolved, perhaps deliberately so.\n\n\nThis film is based loosely on the trial of Lieutenant Thomas MassieUSN, the real-life person that forms the basis of Lieutenant Murdoch. Names of real-life persons have been changed, as follows:\n\n\nIn addition, new characters are added that have no verifiable real-life counterpart, or who performed actions for which there is no real-life counterpart. For example, though John Jardine was probably the most prominent HPD detective involved in the investigation, he was not a captain, but an only a sergeant, and there is no evidence that he or any other HPD officer ever had a romantic liaison with Clarence Darrow's wife.\n\nThis teleplay departs from historical events in many ways, as one can see by comparing the plot summary to the main article on the Massie Trial. For example:\n\n\nCast, crew, and production credits are taken from the All Movie Guide and the Internet Movie Database.\n\nThe historical record comes from the main article on the event on which this film is supposedly based. Further details, such as the details of Thalia's ultimate death, come from an external source describing the 2005 PBS documentary on the Massie Trial itself.\n\nThis film was nominated for two awards, including one Emmy Award for costuming and an Artios Award for casting.\n\n"}

In 2013 Said E. Dawlabani added the value systems approach to the cultural emergence aspect of macroeconomics.\n\nCultural economics develops from how wants and tastes are formed in society. This is partly due to nurture aspects, or what type of environment one is raised in, as it is the internalization of one’s upbringing that shapes their future wants and tastes. Acquired tastes can be thought of as an example of this, as they demonstrate how preferences can be shaped socially.\n\nA key thought area that separates the development of cultural economics from traditional economics is a difference in how individuals arrive at their decisions. While a traditional economist will view decision making as having both implicit and explicit consequences, a cultural economist would argue that an individual will not only arrive at their decision based on these implicit and explicit decisions but based on trajectories. These trajectories consist of regularities, which have been built up throughout the years and guide individuals in their decision-making process.\n\nEconomists have also started to look at cultural economics with a systems thinking approach. In this approach, the economy and culture are each viewed as a single system where \"interaction and feedback effects were acknowledged, and where in particular the dynamic were made explicit\". In this sense, the interdependencies of culture and the economy can be combined and better understood by following this approach.\n\nSaid E. Dawlabani's book \"MEMEnomics: The Next-Generation Economic System\" combines the ideas of value systems (see value (ethics)) and systems thinking to provide one of the first frameworks that explores the effect of economic policies on culture. The book explores the intersections of multiple disciplines such as cultural development, organizational behavior, and memetics all in an attempt to explore the roots of cultural economics.\n\nThe advancing pace of new technology is transforming how the public consumes and shares culture. The cultural economic field has seen great growth with the advent of online social networking which has created productivity improvements in how culture is consumed. New technologies have also lead to cultural convergence where all kinds of culture can be accessed on a single device. Throughout their upbringing, younger persons of the current generation are consuming culture faster than their parents ever did, and through new mediums. The smartphone is a blossoming example of this where books, music, talk, artwork and more can all be accessed on a single device in a matter of seconds. This medium and the culture surrounding it is beginning to have an effect on the economy, whether it be increasing communication while lowering costs, lowering the barriers of entry to the technology economy, or making use of excess capacity.\n\nThis field has also seen growth through the advent of new economic studies that have put on a cultural lens. For example, a recent study on Europeans living with their families into adulthood was conducted by Paola Sapienza, a professor at Northwestern University. The study found that those of Southern European descent tend to live at home with their families longer than those of Northern European descent. Sapienza added cultural critique to her analysis of the research, revealing that it is Southern European culture to stay at home longer and then related this to how those who live at home longer have fewer children and start families later, thus contributing to Europe's falling birthrates. Sapienza's work is an example of how the growth of cultural economics is beginning to spread across the field.\n\nAn area that cultural economics has a strong presence in is sustainable development. Sustainable development has been defined as \"...development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs...\". Culture plays an important role in this as it can determine how people view preparing for these future generations. Delayed gratification is a cultural economic issue that developed countries are currently dealing with. Economists argue that to ensure that the future is better than today, certain measures must be taken such as collecting taxes or \"going green\" to protect the environment. Policies such as these are hard for today's politicians to promote who want to win the vote of today's voters who are concerned with the present and not the future. People want to see the benefits now, not in the future.\n\nEconomist David Throsby has proposed the idea of culturally sustainable development which compasses both the cultural industries (such as the arts) and culture (in the societal sense). He has created a set of criteria in regards to for which policy prescriptions can be compared to in order to ensure growth for future generations. The criteria are as follows:\n\nWith these guidelines, Throsby hopes to spur the recognition between culture and economics, which is something he believes has been lacking from popular economic discussions.\n\nAs a growing field in behavioral economics, the role of culture in financial behavior is increasingly being demonstrate to cause highly significant differentials in the management and valuation of assets. Using the dimensions of culture identified by Shalom Schwartz, it has been proved that corporate dividend payments are determined largely by the dimensions of Mastery and Conservatism. Specifically, higher degrees of conservatism are associated with greater volumes and values of dividend payments, and higher degrees of mastery are associated with the total opposite. A different study assessed the role of culture on earnings management using Geert Hofstede’s cultural dimensions and the index of earnings management developed by Christian Leutz; which includes the use of accrual alteration to reduce volatility in reported earnings, the use of accrual alteration to reduce volatility in reported operating cash flows, use of accounting discretion to mitigate the reporting of small losses, and the use of accounting discretion when reporting operating earnings. It was found that Hofstede's dimension of Individualism was negatively correlated with earnings management, and that Uncertainty Avoidance was positively correlated. Behavioral economist Michael Taillard demonstrated that investment behaviors are caused primarily by behavioral factors, largely attributed to the influence of culture on the psychological frame of the investors in different nations, rather than rational ones by comparing the cultural dimensions used both by Geert Hofstede and Robert House, identifying strong and specific influences in risk aversion behavior resulting from the overlapping cultural dimensions between them that remained constant over a 20-year period.\n\nIn regards to investing, it has been confirmed by multiple studies that greater differences between the cultures of various nations reduces the amount of investment between those countries. It was proven that both cultural differences between nations as well as the amount of unfamiliarity investors have with a culture not their own greatly reduces their willingness to invest in those nations, and that these factors have a negative impact with future returns, resulting in a cost premium on the degree of foreignness of an investment. Despite this, equity markets continue to integrate as indicated by equity price comovements, of which the two largest contributing factors are the ratio of trade between nations and the ratio of GDP resulting from foreign direct investment. Even these factors are the result of behavioral sources, however. The UN World Investment Report (2013) shows that regional integration is occurring at a more rapid rate than distant foreign relations, confirming an earlier study concluding that nations closer to each other tend to be more integrated. Since increased cultural distance reduces the amount of foreign direct investment, this results in an accelerating curvilinear correlation between financial behavior and cultural distance.\n\nCulture also influences which factors are useful when predicting stock valuations. In Jordan, it was found that 84% of variability in stock returns were accounted for by using money supply, interest rate term structure, industry productivity growth, and risk premium; but were not influenced at all by inflation rates or dividend yield. In Nigeria, both real GDP and Consumer Price Index were both useful predictive factors, but foreign exchange rate was not. In Zimbabwe, only money supply and oil prices were found to be useful predictors of stock market valuations. India identified exchange rate, wholesale price index, gold prices, and market index as being useful factors. A comprehensive global study out of Romania attempted to identify if any factors of stock market valuation were culturally universal, identifying interest rates, inflation, and industrial production, but found that exchange rate, currency exchange volume, and trade were all unique to Romania.\n\n"}

{"id": "179339", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=179339", "title": "Decadence", "text": "Decadence\n\nThe word decadence, which at first meant simply \"decline\" in an abstract sense, is now most often used to refer to a perceived decay in standards, morals, dignity, religious faith, or skill at governing among the members of the elite of a very large social structure, such as an empire or nation state. By extension, it may refer to a decline in art, literature, science, technology, and work ethics, or (very loosely) to self-indulgent behavior.\n\nUsage of the term sometimes implies moral censure, or an acceptance of the idea, met with throughout the world since ancient times, that such declines are objectively observable and that they inevitably precede the destruction of the society in question; for this reason, modern historians use it with caution. The word originated in Medieval Latin \"(dēcadentia)\", appeared in 16th-century French, and entered English soon afterwards. It bore the neutral meaning of decay, decrease, or decline until the late 19th century, when the influence of new theories of social degeneration contributed to its modern meaning.\n\nIn literature, the Decadent movement—late nineteenth century \"fin de siècle\" writers who were associated with Symbolism or the Aesthetic movement—was first given its name by hostile critics. Later it was triumphantly adopted by some of the writers themselves. The Decadents praised artifice over nature and sophistication over simplicity, defying contemporary discourses of decline by embracing subjects and styles that their critics considered morbid and over-refined. Some of these writers were influenced by the tradition of the Gothic novel and by the poetry and fiction of Edgar Allan Poe.\n\nDecadence was the name given to a number of late nineteenth-century writers who valued artifice over the earlier Romantics' naïve view of nature. Some of them triumphantly adopted the name, referring to themselves as Decadents. For the most part, they were influenced by the tradition of the Gothic novel and by the poetry and fiction of Edgar Allan Poe, and were associated with Symbolism and/or Aestheticism.\n\nThis concept of decadence dates from the eighteenth century, especially from Montesquieu, and was taken up by critics as a term of abuse after Désiré Nisard used it against Victor Hugo and Romanticism in general. A later generation of Romantics, such as Théophile Gautier and Charles Baudelaire took the word as a badge of pride, as a sign of their rejection of what they saw as banal \"progress.\" In the 1880s, a group of French writers referred to themselves as Decadents. The classic novel from this group is Joris-Karl Huysmans' \"Against Nature\", often seen as the first great decadent work, though others attribute this honor to Baudelaire's works.\n\nIn Britain and Ireland the leading figure associated with the Decadent movement was Irish writer, Oscar Wilde. Other significant figures include Arthur Symons, Aubrey Beardsley and Ernest Dowson.\n\nThe Symbolist movement has frequently been confused with the Decadent movement. Several young writers were derisively referred to in the press as \"decadent\" in the mid-1880s. Jean Moréas' manifesto was largely a response to this polemic. A few of these writers embraced the term while most avoided it. Although the aesthetics of Symbolism and Decadence can be seen as overlapping in some areas, the two remain distinct.\n\nThis \"fertile culture\" of Berlin extended onwards until Adolf Hitler rose to power in early 1933 and stamped out any and all resistance to the Nazi Party. Likewise, the Nazis decried Berlin as a haven of vice. A new culture developed in and around Berlin, including architecture and design (Bauhaus, 1919–33), a variety of literature (Döblin, \"Berlin Alexanderplatz\", 1929), film (Lang, \"Metropolis\", 1927, Dietrich, \"Der blaue Engel\", 1930), painting (Grosz), and music (Brecht and Weill, \"The Threepenny Opera\", 1928), criticism (Benjamin), philosophy/psychology (Jung), and fashion. This culture was often considered to be decadent, and socially, morally, destructive.\n\nFilm was making huge technical and artistic strides during this period of time in Berlin, and gave rise to the influential movement called German Expressionism. \"Talkies\", the Sound films, were also becoming more popular with the general public across Europe, and Berlin was producing very many of them.\n\nBerlin in the 20s also proved to be a haven for English writers such as W. H. Auden, Stephen Spender and Christopher Isherwood, who wrote a series of 'Berlin novels', inspiring the play \"I Am a Camera\", which was later adapted into a musical, \"Cabaret\", and an Academy Award winning film of the same name. Spender's semi-autobiographical novel \"The Temple\" evokes the attitude and atmosphere of the place at the time.\n\nAccording to Vladimir Lenin, capitalism had reached its highest stage and could no longer provide for the general development of society. He expected reduced vigor in economic activity and a growth in unhealthy economic phenomena, reflecting capitalism's gradually decreasing capacity to provide for social needs and preparing the ground for socialist revolution in the West. Politically, World War I proved the decadent nature of the advanced capitalist countries to Lenin, that capitalism had reached the stage where it would destroy its own prior achievements more than it would advance.\n\nOne who directly opposed the idea of decadence as expressed by Lenin was José Ortega y Gasset in \"The Revolt of the Masses\" (1930). He argued that the \"mass man\" had the notion of material progress and scientific advance deeply inculcated to the extent that it was an expectation. He also argued that contemporary progress was opposite the true decadence of the Roman Empire.\n\nDecadence is an important aspect of contemporary left communist theory. Similar to Lenin's use of it, left communists, coming from the Communist International themselves started in fact with a theory of decadence in the first place, yet the communist left sees the theory of decadence at the heart of Marx's method as well, expressed in famous works such as \"The Communist Manifesto\", \"Grundrisse\", \"Das Kapital\" but most significantly in \"Preface to the Critique of Political Economy\".\n\nContemporary left communist theory defends that Lenin was mistaken on his definition of imperialism (although how grave his mistake was and how much of his work on imperialism is valid varies from groups to groups) and Rosa Luxemburg to be basically correct on this question, thus accepting capitalism as a world epoch similarly to Lenin, but a world epoch from which no capitalist state can oppose or avoid being a part of. On the other hand, the theoretical framework of capitalism's decadence varies between different groups while left communist organizations like the International Communist Current hold a basically Luxemburgist analysis that makes an emphasis on the world market and its expansion, others hold views more in line with those of Vladimir Lenin, Nikolai Bukharin and most importantly Henryk Grossman and Paul Mattick with an emphasis on monopolies and the falling rate of profit.\n\n\n\n"}

For example, the actual designer of Chanel is not its original founder and designer, Gabrielle Chanel, but German designer Karl Lagerfeld. The quality of the clothing and degree of its resemblance, if any, to the designer's work vary considerably depending on the licensee and the terms of the agreement the designer has struck. Some terms may limit the number of garment styles that may be produced, allowing the designer to veto any designs he or she finds unappealing. Examples include:\n\n\nThis licensing of designer names was pioneered by designers like Pierre Cardin in the 1960s and has been a common practice within the fashion industry from about the 1970s.\n\n \nDesigner jeans are available at many different price points usually at several hundreds of dollars, with some even approaching $1,000 USD.. Before the \"Great Recession,\" premium denim was one of the fastest growing categories of the apparel business, and there seemed to be no limit to what customers would pay for the latest label, fit, finish, or wash. \nAmericans bought $13.8 billion USD of men's and women's jeans in the year ended April 30, 2011, according to market-research firm NPD Group. But only about 1% of jeans sold in the U.S. over that year cost more than $50. Since the \"Great Recession,\" the landscape for premium jeans has changed: “Charging $600 for jeans for no reason at all — those days are over,” said You Nguyen, the senior vice president of women’s merchandising and design for Levi Strauss & Company. \n\nThe difference between the $300 jeans and the $30 jeans often has to do with the fabric quality, hardware, washes, design details, abrasions, and where they are manufactured. A \"fancy\" pair of jeans that has been treated with abrasions, extra washes, etc., to break the denim down to achieve a texture has undergone a certain amount of damage to get the 'worn in' feel. In this sense, the expensive jeans may be more delicate than the cheap ones. Jeans brands also try to stand out from season to season by using patented materials, such as rivets and stitching, and by using special washes and distressing methods. These might involve dying, pressing, and even using sandpaper and drills on the raw jeans. These methods can be particularly expensive when done in the U.S., where factories must meet more stringent environmental and labor standards than in many low-cost nations. \n\nTo be produced domestically (in the United States), jeans have to be priced at \"$200-plus,\" says Shelda Hartwell-Hale, a vice president at Directives West, an L.A.-based division of fashion consulting firm Doneger Group. The profit margins on premium jeans can be substantial. One retail executive says his gross profit margins for private-label jeans, which he makes for Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Sears Holdings Corp., and other retailers, are less than 20%, whereas the margins for his own premium lines are 40%-to-50%.\n\n"}

A draper may additionally operate as a cloth merchant or a haberdasher. \nDrapers were an important trade guild during the medieval period, when the sellers of cloth operated out of draper's shops. However the original meaning of the term has now largely fallen out of use.\n\nIn 1724, Jonathan Swift wrote a series of satirical pamphlets in the guise of a draper called the \"Drapier's Letters\".\n\nA number of notable people who have at one time or another worked as drapers include:\n\nA draper is now defined as a highly skilled role within the fashion industry. The term is used within a fashion design or costume design studio for people tasked with creating garments or patterns by draping fabric over a dress form; draping uses a human form to physically position the cloth into a desired pattern. This is an alternative method to drafting, when the garment is initially worked out from measurements on paper. \n\nA fashion draper may also be known as a \"first hand\" because they are often the most skilled creator in the workshop and the \"first\" to work with the cloth for a garment.

{"id": "190837", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=190837", "title": "Evolutionary algorithm", "text": "Evolutionary algorithm\n\nIn artificial intelligence, an evolutionary algorithm (EA) is a subset of evolutionary computation, a generic population-based metaheuristic optimization algorithm. An EA uses mechanisms inspired by biological evolution, such as reproduction, mutation, recombination, and selection. Candidate solutions to the optimization problem play the role of individuals in a population, and the fitness function determines the quality of the solutions (see also loss function). Evolution of the population then takes place after the repeated application of the above operators.\n\nEvolutionary algorithms often perform well approximating solutions to all types of problems because they ideally do not make any assumption about the underlying fitness landscape. Techniques from evolutionary algorithms applied to the modeling of biological evolution are generally limited to explorations of microevolutionary processes and planning models based upon cellular processes. In most real applications of EAs, computational complexity is a prohibiting factor. In fact, this computational complexity is due to fitness function evaluation. Fitness approximation is one of the solutions to overcome this difficulty. However, seemingly simple EA can solve often complex problems; therefore, there may be no direct link between algorithm complexity and problem complexity.\n\nStep One: Generate the initial population of individuals randomly. (First generation)\n\nStep Two: Evaluate the fitness of each individual in that population (time limit, sufficient fitness achieved, etc.)\n\nStep Three: Repeat the following regenerational steps until termination:\n\nSimilar techniques differ in genetic representation and other implementation details, and the nature of the particular applied problem.\n\nA possible limitation of many evolutionary algorithms is their lack of a clear genotype-phenotype distinction. In nature, the fertilized egg cell undergoes a complex process known as embryogenesis to become a mature phenotype. This indirect encoding is believed to make the genetic search more robust (i.e. reduce the probability of fatal mutations), and also may improve the evolvability of the organism. Such indirect (a.k.a. generative or developmental) encodings also enable evolution to exploit the regularity in the environment. Recent work in the field of artificial embryogeny, or artificial developmental systems, seeks to address these concerns. And gene expression programming successfully explores a genotype-phenotype system, where the genotype consists of linear multigenic chromosomes of fixed length and the phenotype consists of multiple expression trees or computer programs of different sizes and shapes. \n\nSwarm algorithms include\n\n\nThe computer simulations \"Tierra\" and \"Avida\" attempt to model macroevolutionary dynamics.\n\n"}
{"id": "2199545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2199545", "title": "Fingerpoke of Doom", "text": "Fingerpoke of Doom\n\nThe nickname Fingerpoke of Doom (FPOD) refers to an infamous incident in American professional wrestling which occurred on January 4, 1999 at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, Georgia, during a live broadcast of \"Nitro\", the flagship show of World Championship Wrestling (WCW).\n\nThe incident occurred during the main event of \"Nitro\", featuring WCW World Heavyweight Champion Kevin Nash, who was the leader of the Wolfpac faction of the New World Order (nWo), and Hollywood Hogan, the leader of the Hollywood faction of the nWo, with whom Nash and his group had been feuding since April 1998 when the original faction split up, and Hogan had retired from wrestling. The Wolfpac faction were babyfaces (heroes), while the Hollywood faction were heels (villains), as was the original nWo.\n\nThe match saw Hogan poke Nash in the chest with his index finger, prompting Nash to theatrically throw himself onto the mat and allow Hogan to pin him; the victory marked the reunion of both nWo factions into one villainous group. During the same broadcast, WCW announcer Tony Schiavone gave away the results of their Monday Night Wars rival World Wrestling Federation's \"Raw Is War\" (which was taped six days earlier and aired on tape delay at the same time Nitro was being aired live), revealing that wrestler Mick Foley (as Mankind) was set to win the WWF Championship. Although this revelation was meant to deter \"Nitro\" viewers from switching to \"Raw Is War\", it instead reportedly prompted 600,000 viewers to change channels in order to see Foley's victory, with most viewers only tuning back in to \"Nitro\" when there were five minutes left in the broadcast. The incident was named \"The Fingerpoke of Doom\" both for Nash's over-selling the finger poke, and for the negative ramifications the incident had for the company as a whole, with some wrestling journalists crediting it as the beginning of WCW's ultimate downfall and loss of the Monday Night Wars.\n\nThe match was directly related to a controversial main event that occurred at Starrcade in December 1998, during which Kevin Nash pinned Goldberg to win the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. At the time of the match, Goldberg had been undefeated in his WCW career; and his defeat came about due to the interference of Nash's former tag team partner Scott Hall.\n\nThe following evening, Nash professed dissatisfaction with Hall's interference, and offered Goldberg a rematch for the following episode of \"Nitro\" in Atlanta. However, Goldberg was kayfabe arrested halfway through the three-hour \"Nitro\" at the Georgia Dome and accused of \"aggravated stalking\" by Miss Elizabeth (Goldberg was originally to have been accused of rape, but refused to go along with that particular storyline). Although Goldberg was later released when Elizabeth could not keep her story straight, he would not make it back to the arena in time to compete against Nash; it was noted in \"The Death of WCW\" by R.D. Reynolds and Bryan Alvarez that the entire skit was proven to make no sense after it was revealed that the police station was across the street from the Georgia Dome.\n\nMeanwhile, Hollywood Hogan showed up for the first time since declaring his retirement one month prior. Hogan and Nash had been in a feud since April 1998, when Nash became a fan favorite by breaking away from Hogan's nWo stable in order to form his own rival faction, nWo Wolfpac; Hogan remained a villain, leading his own nWo faction, nWo Hollywood. In Goldberg's absence, Nash offered the title shot to Hogan, who accepted the offer.\n\nHogan came out to the ring accompanied by Scott Steiner, who had taken over the leadership role in nWo Hollywood. Nash came out next, then revealed a surprise to Hogan and the crowd by stopping at the end of the entrance ramp and pointing backwards. The surprise was Hall, who had been a part of nWo Hollywood for most of the last seven months and who entered wearing a Wolfpac T-shirt. This marked the reunion of The Outsiders, who had broken up as a tag team at Slamboree in May 1998.\n\nThe match started with the two men circling each other. Nash tried intimidating Hogan by pushing him hard into the corner. In retaliation, Hogan then hinted at punching Nash only to poke him in the chest. Nash fell on his back in a theatrical manner, which has been compared to \"getting hit in the chest with a cannonball\". Hogan then covered him to get the pinfall and was declared the new WCW World Heavyweight Champion.\n\nAfter this occurred, Hall and Steiner entered the ring and celebrated with Nash and Hogan to signify the Wolfpac and Hollywood factions were reuniting again. As Hogan had done before each time he had won the title since August 1996, he spray-painted the belt's faceplate with \"nWo\". However, to signify the reunion with the Wolfpac, Hogan used red spray paint. Meanwhile, the dissatisfied crowd began pelting the ring with food and other debris.\n\nGoldberg then reentered the building and ran to the ring to attack the reunited nWo members. Wolfpac member Lex Luger followed him, appearing to assist him, but instead jumped Goldberg from behind and showed he was also part of the reunited nWo. Goldberg was handcuffed to the ropes, repeatedly shocked with a taser, and had \"nWo 4 Life\" painted in red and black paint all over his back. A loud \"We want Sting!\" chant erupted from the fans in the Georgia Dome, hoping that Sting would come to rescue Goldberg and even things up for WCW. However, Sting had been out since Bret Hart attacked him at Halloween Havoc in October and would not appear again until March 1999; by that time the nWo reunion story had largely petered out in favor of Ric Flair taking control of WCW, and most of the nWo members had been sidelined due to injuries.\n\nAiring opposite \"Nitro\" this night was the episode of \"Raw Is War\" in which Mick Foley (as Mankind) won the WWF Championship from The Rock. As per their procedures at the time, the WWF had taped this particular episode of \"Raw Is War\" six days in advance of the program's airing and even acknowledged the title change on their website immediately after the taping had concluded. Earlier that night, armed with knowledge of what happened, WCW announcer Tony Schiavone, who was acting on orders from Eric Bischoff, gave away the result of the match before it aired: \nWithin minutes, as shown by Nielsen ratings, several hundred thousand viewers switched channels from \"Nitro\" on TNT to \"Raw Is War\" on the USA Network. After Mankind won the title, many fans then switched back to \"Nitro\", which still had five minutes of air time left. The final ratings for the night were 5.7 for \"Raw Is War\" and 5.0 for \"Nitro\".\n\nThe next week on \"Raw Is War\", there were signs in the crowd that said: \"Mick Foley put my butt in this seat\".\n\nIn \"WrestleCrap: The Very Worst of Pro Wrestling\", R.D. Reynolds says of the match, \"That was that. Fans had been burned one time too many by WCW and the nWo. From that point on in 1999, ratings steadily dropped for the company\".\n\nWWE refers to the match as \"one of the most scandalous title changes of all time\" and states that \"shocking does not even adequately describe this moment\". According to wrestling writers Brian Fritz and Christopher Murray, the event insulted fans, upset viewers, and alerted other wrestlers in the company of problems. They draw a direct link between the title change and the drop in ratings that took place in its aftermath. In \"The Death of WCW\", Reynolds and Alvarez expand on this link, stating that the January 4 incident \"more than any other, started the ball rolling towards the company's inevitable doom\". They believe that the \"now-legendary\" event made the episode \"the single most destructive \"Nitro\" in the history of the company\" and call it a \"disaster of epic proportions\". The \"New York Daily News\" stated that the match \"is widely considered the beginning of the end for WCW\".\n\nIn an interview with RF Video, Nash claimed that he had nothing to do with the booking of the incident. When discussing what RF Video refers to as \"infamous one finger pin with Hogan\", Nash said that Goldberg was the one who caused that rumor to be spread and that he had not begun booking until February 1999. In \"The Rise and Fall of WCW\", Goldberg said that the incident was Hogan and Nash playing their own little games against the wrestling world. Furthermore, Reynolds and Alvarez contended in \"The Death of WCW\" that the actions of Hogan and Nash from the time Goldberg beat Hogan in Atlanta until their own match in the same venue six months later, including the match itself, were part of an ongoing plot between the two wrestlers.\n\nOn the August 31, 2009 episode of \"Raw\", Dusty Rhodes, Shawn Michaels, and Triple H were shown watching and discussing footage of the Hogan–Nash match backstage.\n\nIn his autobiography, \"Hollywood Hulk Hogan\", Hulk Hogan rejected the idea that the Fingerpoke of Doom was pivotal in WCW's fall. He claimed that \"watering down the whole concept\" of the New World Order by splitting the group and creating spinoffs such as the Latino World Order and an inability to compete with the WWF's more risqué \"Attitude style\" were more responsible for WCW's downfall.\n\nEric Bischoff's autobiography \"Controversy Creates Ca$h\" includes a chapter entitled \"The Turning Point That Wasn't\". In it, Bischoff claimed that singling out the Fingerpoke as the reason WCW went under to be an over-simplification. He did acknowledge that people switched from watching \"Nitro\" to \"Raw Is War\" after Schiavone's remark about Foley winning the WWF Championship, but claimed that \"the tide had turned so significantly that us talking about one match didn't matter\".\n"}

It was told to them by Henriette Dorothea Wild (whom Wilhelm Grimm married in 1825) with more details, which were added in the second edition (1819). It is still a common expression in Hesse and beyond to say \"Hulda is making her bed\" when it is snowing, that is, she shakes her bed and out comes snow from heaven.\n\nIn the second edition of the book in 1819 they added some details, most prominently the rooster's greetings, provided by a correspondent: Georg August Friedrich Goldmann from Hanover. Like many other tales collected by the brothers Grimm the story of Frau Holle was told to teach a moral. In this case, it is that hard work is rewarded and laziness is punished.\n\nA rich widow lives with her daughter and her stepdaughter. The widow favored her younger biological daughter allowing her to become spoiled and idle while her older stepdaughter was left to do all the work. Every day the stepdaughter would sit outside the cottage and spin beside the well.\n\nOne day she pricked her finger on the point of the spindle. Leaning over the well to wash the blood away, the spindle fell from her hand and sank out of sight. The stepdaughter feared that she would be punished for losing the spindle, and in a panic she leapt into the well after it.\n\nThe girl found herself in a meadow where she came upon an oven full of bread. The bread asked to be taken out before it burned. With a baker's peel she took all the loaves out and then walked on. Then she came to an apple tree that asked that its apples be harvested. So she did so and gathered them into a pile, before continuing on her way. Finally she came to a small house of an old woman, who offered to allow the girl to stay if she would help with the housework.\n\nThe woman identified herself as Frau Holle, and cautioned the girl to shake the featherbed pillows and coverlet well when she made the bed, as that would make it snow in the girl's world. The girl agreed to take service with Frau Holle, and took care to always shake the featherbed until the feathers flew about like snowflakes.\n\nAfter a time, the girl became homesick and told Frau Holle that it was time for her to return home. Frau Holle had been impressed by the girl's kindness and hard work so much that when she escorted the girl to the gate, a shower of gold fell upon the girl. She also gave her the spindle which had fallen into the well. With that the gate was closed, and the girl found herself back, not far from her mother's house. \n\nHer mother wished the same good fortune for her biological daughter. She also set her to sit by the well and spin, but the girl deliberately threw the spindle into the well before jumping in herself. She too came to the oven, but would not assist the bread; nor would she help the apple tree. When she came to Frau Holle's house, she likewise took service there, but before long fell into her lazy, careless ways. Frau Holle soon dismissed her. As the lazy girl stood at the gate, a kettle of pitch spilled over her. \"That is what you have earned,\" said Frau Holle, and closed the gate.\n\nOther versions describe the first girl having a piece of gold fall from her lips every time she speaks whilst the second has a toad fall from her lips everytime she speaks.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> That is why, in Hessen whenever it snows they say that Frau Holle is making her bed.\n\nMarija Gimbutas names Hulda (or Holda, Holla, Holle) as having originally been an ancient Germanic supreme goddess who predates most of the Germanic pantheon, including deities such as Odin, Thor, Freya, and Loki, continuing traditions of pre-Indo-European Neolithic Europe. \n\nAs Christianity slowly replaced Scandinavian paganism during the Early Middle Ages, many of the old customs were gradually lost or assimilated into Christian tradition. By the end of the High Middle Ages, Scandinavian paganism was almost completely marginalized and blended into rural folklore, in which the character of Frau Hulda eventually survived.\n\nIn Germanic Pre-Christian folklore, Hulda, Holda, Holle and Holla were all names to denote a single being. According to Erika Timm, Perchta emerged from an amalgamation of Germanic and pre-Germanic, probably Celtic, traditions of the Alpine regions after the Migration Period in the Early Middle Ages. Hulda is also related to the Germanic figure of Perchta. She dwells at the bottom of a well, rides a wagon, and first taught the craft of making linen from flax. Holle is the goddess to whom children who died as infants go, and alternatively known as both the Dunkle Großmutter (Dark Grandmother) and the \"Weisse Frau\" (White Lady), elements which are more typically associated with the Grimms' fairy tale as well. Her connection to the spirit world through the magic of spinning and weaving has associated her with witchcraft in Catholic German folklore.\n\nFrau Holle is one of Germany's most durable female legendary figures and represents a pre-Christian deity who survived in popular belief and in the memory of common people well into the nineteenth century.\n\nThe Grimms say Perchta or Berchta was known \"precisely in those Upper German regions where Holda leaves off, in Swabia, in Alsace, in Switzerland, in Bavaria and Austria.\"\nAccording to Jacob Grimm (1882), Perchta was spoken of in Old High German in the 10th century as Frau Berchta and thought to be a white-robed female spirit. She was known as a goddess who oversaw spinning and weaving, like myths of Holda in Continental German regions. He believes she was the feminine equivalent of Berchtold, and she was sometimes the leader of the Wild Hunt.\n\nAccording to Erika Timm, Perchta emerged from an amalgamation of Germanic and pre-Germanic, probably Celtic, traditions of the Alpine regions after the Migration Period in the Early Middle Ages.\n\nLike many of the other tales collected by the Grimm brothers, \"Frau Holle\" personifies good behavior and bad, and the appropriate reward meted out for each. Even so, it also exhibits a number of contrasts with other stories. Typically, the magical beings who appear in the tales must enter the real world and appear to the protagonists before any intercession can take place. Moreover, these beings are almost always anonymous and therefore difficult to correlate with figures in pre-Christian mythology. By contrast, Frau Holle resides somewhere above the earth, and the protagonists must go to her, paradoxically by diving into a spring. When she makes her bed, loose feathers are 'stirred up' and fall to earth as snow, and so this fairy tale is an origin myth as well. Comparison between Frau Holle and a weather or earth goddess is inevitable. Jakob Grimm notes that Thunar (Thor) makes rain in a similar fashion, implying for Frau Holle a very high rank in the pantheon. \n\nThough not unique in this respect, the Frau Holle story is also notable for the absence of class-related motifs such as palaces, balls to which one may or may not be invited, and the rise to the status of the nobility through marriage.\n\nAccording to the Aarne and Thompson classification system of fairy tales, \"Mother Hulda\" is a story of type 480, \"The Kind and the Unkind Girls\". Others of this type include \"Shita-kiri Suzume\", \"Diamonds and Toads\", \"The Three Heads in the Well\", \"Father Frost\", \"The Three Little Men in the Wood\", \"The Enchanted Wreath\", \"The Old Witch\", and \"The Two Caskets\". Literary variants include \"The Three Fairies\" and \"Aurore and Aimée\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "43094", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43094", "title": "Gender role", "text": "Gender role\n\nA gender role, also known as a sex role, is a social role encompassing a range of behaviors and attitudes that are generally considered acceptable, appropriate, or desirable for people based on their actual or perceived sex or sexuality. Gender roles are usually centered on conceptions of femininity and masculinity, although there are exceptions and variations. The specifics regarding these gendered expectations may vary substantially among cultures, while other characteristics may be common throughout a range of cultures. There is ongoing debate as to what extent gender roles and their variations are biologically determined, and to what extent they are socially constructed.\n\nVarious groups, most notably the feminist movement, have led efforts to change aspects of prevailing gender roles that they believe are oppressive or inaccurate.\n\nThe term \"gender role\" was first used by John Money and colleagues in 1954, during the course of his study of intersex individuals, to describe the manners in which these individuals expressed their status as a male or female in a situation where no clear biological assignment existed.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines gender roles as \"socially constructed roles, behaviors, activities and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for men and women\". Debate continues as to what extent gender and gender roles are socially constructed (i.e. non-biologically influenced), and to what extent \"socially constructed\" may be considered synonymous with \"arbitrary\" or \"malleable\". Therefore, a concise authoritative definition of gender roles or gender itself is elusive.\n\nIn the sociology of gender, the process whereby an individual learns and acquires a gender role in society is termed \"gender socialization\".\n\nGender roles are culturally specific, and while some cultures distinguish only two (boy and girl or man and woman), others recognize more. Androgyny, for example, has been proposed as a third gender. Androgynous is simply a person with qualities pertaining to both the male and female gender. Other societies have claimed to identify more than five genders, and some non-Western societies have three genders – man, woman, and third gender. Some individuals (not necessarily being from such a culture) identify with no gender at all.\n\nMany transgender people reject the idea that they are a separate third gender, and identify simply as men or women. However, biological differences between (some) trans women and cisgender women have historically been treated as relevant in certain contexts, especially those where biological traits may yield an unfair advantage such as sport.\n\nGender \"role,\" which refers to the cultural expectations as understood by gender classification, is not the same thing as gender identity, which refers to the internal sense of one's own gender, whether or not it aligns with categories offered by societal norms. The point at which these internalized gender identities become externalized into a set of expectations is the genesis of a gender role.\n\nSome theories – which are collectively termed \"social construction\" theories – claim that gender behavior is mostly due to social conventions, although opposing theories disagree, such as theories in evolutionary psychology.\n\nMost children learn to categorize themselves by gender by the age of three. From birth, in the course of gender socialization, children learn gender stereotypes and roles from their parents and environment. In a traditional view, males learn to manipulate their physical and social environment through physical strength or dexterity, while girls learn to present themselves as objects to be viewed. Social constructionists state, for example, that gender-segregated children's activities create the appearance that gender differences in behavior reflect an essential nature of male and female behavior.\n\nAs an aspect of role theory, gender role theory \"treats these differing distributions of women and men into roles as the primary origin of sex-differentiated social behavior, their impact on behavior is mediated by psychological and social processes.\" According to Gilbert Herdt, gender roles arose from correspondent inference, meaning that general labour division was extended to gender roles.\n\nGender roles are considered by social constructionists to be hierarchical, and are characterized as a male-advantaged gender hierarchy. The term patriarchy, according to researcher Andrew Cherlin, defines \"a social order based on the domination of women by men, especially in agricultural societies\".\n\nAccording to Eagly \"et al.\", the consequences of gender roles and stereotypes are sex-typed social behavior because roles and stereotypes are both socially shared descriptive norms and prescriptive norms. \n\nJudith Butler, in works such as \"Gender Trouble\" and \"Undoing Gender\", contends that being female is not \"natural\" and that it appears natural only through repeated performances of gender; these performances in turn, reproduce and define the traditional categories of sex and/or gender.\n\nWorking in the United States, Talcott Parsons developed a model of the nuclear family in 1955, which at that place and time was the prevalent family structure. It compared a strictly traditional view of gender roles (from an industrial-age American perspective) with a more liberal view. The Parsons model was used to contrast and illustrate extreme positions on gender roles.\n\nHowever, these structured positions become less a liberal-individualist society, and the actual behavior of individuals is usually somewhere between these poles. According to the interactionist approach, roles (including gender roles) are not fixed but are constantly negotiated between individuals. In North America and southern South America, this is the most common approach among families whose business is agriculture.\n\nGender roles can influence all kinds of behaviors, such as choice of clothing, choice of work and personal relationships, e.g., parental status (See also Sociology of fatherhood).\n\nGeert Hofstede, a Dutch researcher and social psychologist who dedicated himself to the study of culture, sees culture as \"broad patterns of thinking, feeling and acting\" in a society In Hofstede's view, masculinity and femininity differ in the social roles that are associated with the biological fact of the existence of the two sexes: masculinity and femininity refer to the dominant sex role pattern in the vast majority of both traditional and modern societies, males being more assertive and females more nurturing.\n\nFemininity creates a society of overlapping gender roles, where \"both men and women are supposed to be modest, tender, and concerned with the quality of life.\"\n\nMasculinity creates a society of clearly distinct gender roles, where men should \"be assertive, tough, and focused on material success,\" while women should \"be more modest, tender, and concerned with the quality of life.\"\n\nHofstede's \"Feminine and Masculine Culture Dimensions\" states:\n\nMasculine cultures expect men to be assertive, ambitious and competitive, to strive for material success, and to respect whatever is big, strong, and fast. Masculine cultures expect women to serve and care for the non-material quality of life, for children and for the weak. Feminine cultures, on the other hand, define relatively overlapping social roles for the sexes, in which, in particular, men need not be ambitious or competitive but may go for a different quality of life than material success; men may respect whatever is small, weak, and slow.\n\nIn feminine cultures, modesty and relationships are important characteristics. This differs from in masculine cultures, where self-enhancement leads to self-esteem. Masculine cultures are individualistic, and feminine cultures are more collective because of the significance of personal relationships.\n\n'The dominant values in a masculine society are achievement and success; the dominant values in a feminine society are caring for others and quality of life'.\n\nIn the 1940s, Albert Ellis studied eighty-four cases of mixed births and concluded that 'while the power of the human sex drive may possibly be largely dependent on physiological factors... the direction of this drive does not seem to be directly dependent on constitutional element'. In the development of masculinity, femininity, and inclinations towards homosexuality or heterosexuality, nurture matters a great deal more than nature.\n\n\"In the 1950s, John Money, along with colleagues took up the study of intersex individuals, who, Money realized 'would provide invaluable material for the comparative study for bodily form and physiology, rearing, and psychosexual orientation'.\" \"Money and his colleagues used their own studies to state in the extreme what these days seems extraordinary for its complete denial of the notion of natural inclination.\"\n\nThey concluded that gonads, hormones, and chromosomes did not automatically determine a child's gender role. Among the many terms he coined was \"gender role\" which he defined in a seminal 1955 paper as \"all those things that a person says or does to disclose himself or herself as having the status of boy or man, girl or woman.\"\n\nIn recent years, the majority of Money's theories regarding the importance of socialization in the determination of gender have come under intense criticism, especially in connection with the false reporting of success in the \"John/Joan\" case, later revealed to be David Reimer.\n\nWest and Zimmerman developed an interactionist perspective on gender beyond its construction as \"roles.\" For them, gender is \"the product of social doings of some sort...undertaken by men and women whose competence as members of society is hostage to its production\". They argue that the use of \"role\" to describe gender expectations conceals the production of gender through everyday activities. Furthermore, roles are situated identities, such as \"nurse\" and \"student,\" developed as the situation demands while gender is a master identity with no specific site or organizational context. For them, \"conceptualizing gender as a role makes it difficult to assess its influence on other roles and reduces its explanatory usefulness in discussions of power and inequality\". West and Zimmerman consider gender an individual production that reflects and constructs interactional and institutional gender expectations.\n\nBecause of the influence of Simone de Beauvoir's feminist works and Michel Foucault's reflections on sexuality (among others), the idea that gender was unrelated to sex gained ground during the 1980s, especially in sociology and cultural anthropology. This view asserts that the relationship between gender and sex (presence of genitals/gonads) is not causally determinate. That is, that one may have the genitals of one sex while having the gender of another.\n\nThere continues to be debate on the subject. Simon Baron-Cohen, a Cambridge University professor of psychology and psychiatry claims 'the female brain is predominantly \"hard-wired\" for empathy, while the male brain is predominantly \"hard-wired\" for understanding and building systems'. However, Nash and Grossi describe his study of newborns as \"fraught with methodological problems\".\n\nSeveral studies have been conducted looking at the gender roles of intersex children.\n\nOne such study looked at female infants with adrenal hyperplasia, and who had excess male hormone levels, but were thought to be females and raised as such by their parents. These girls were more likely to express masculine traits.\n\nAnother study looked at 18 infants with the intersex condition 5-alpha reductase deficiency, and XY chromosomes, assigned female at birth. At adult age only one individual maintained a female role, all the others being stereotypically male.\n\nIn a third study, 14 male children born with cloacal exstrophy and assigned female at birth, including through intersex medical interventions. Upon follow-up between the ages of 5 to 12, eight of them identified as boys, and all of the subjects had at least moderately male-typical attitudes and interests.\nDr. Sandra Lipsitz Bem is a psychologist who developed the gender schema theory, based on the combination of aspects of the social learning theory and the cognitive-development theory of sex role acquisition, to explain how individuals come to use gender as an organizing category in all aspects of their life. In 1971, she created the Bem Sex-Role Inventory to measure how well an individual conformed to a traditional gender role, characterizing those tested as having masculine, feminine, androgynous, or undifferentiated personality. She believed that through gender-schematic processing, a person spontaneously sorts attributes and behaviors into masculine and feminine categories, and that therefore individuals processes information and regulate their behavior based on whatever definitions of femininity and masculinity their culture provides.\n\nWhile there are differences in average capabilities of various kinds (E.g. better average balance in females or greater average physical size and endurance in males) between the sexes the capabilities of some members of one sex will fall within the range of capabilities needed for tasks conventionally assigned to the other sex. Eve Shapiro, author of \"Gender Circuits\", explains that \"gender, like other social categories, is both a personal identity and a culture set of behaviors, beliefs and values.\"\n\nResearch at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center has also shown that gender roles may be biological among primates. Yerkes researchers studied the interactions of 11 male and 23 female Rhesus monkeys with human toys, both wheeled and plush. The males played mostly with the wheeled toys while the females played with both types equally. Study co-author Kim Wallen has, however, warned against overinterpreting the results as the color and size of the toys may also have been factors.\n\nIdeas of appropriate behavior according to gender vary among cultures and era, although some aspects receive more widespread attention than others. R.W. Connell in \"Men, Masculinities and Feminism\" claims:\n\nThere are huge areal differences in attitudes towards appropriate gender roles. In the \"World Values Survey\", responders were asked if they thought that wage work should be restricted to only men in the case of shortage in jobs: in Iceland the proportion that agreed with the proposition was 3.6%; while in Egypt it was 94.9%.\n\nAttitudes have also varied historically, for example, in Europe, during the Middle Ages, women were commonly associated with roles related to medicine and healing. Because of the rise of witch-hunts across Europe and the institutionalization of medicine, these roles became exclusively associated with men but in the last few decades these roles have become largely gender-neutral in Western society.\n\nVern Bullough stated that homosexual communities are generally more tolerant of switching gender roles. For instance, someone with a masculine voice, a five o'clock shadow (or a fuller beard), an Adam's apple, wearing a woman's dress and high heels, carrying a purse would most likely draw ridicule or other unfriendly attention in ordinary social contexts.\n\nBecause the dominant class sees this form of gender expression as unacceptable, inappropriate, or perhaps threatening, these individuals are significantly more likely to experience discrimination and harassment both in their personal lives and from their employer, according to a 2011 report from the Center for American Progress.\n\nGender roles may be a means through which one expresses their gender identity, but they may also be employed as a means of exerting social control, and individuals may experience negative social consequences for violating them.\n\nDifferent religious and cultural groups within one country may have different norms that they attempt to \"police\" within their own group, including gender norms.\n\n\"I Corinthians,\" 11:14 and 15 indicates that it is inappropriate for a man to wear his hair long, and good for a woman to wear her hair long.\n\nThe roles of women in Christianity can vary considerably today as they have varied historically since the first century New Testament church. This is especially true in marriage and in formal ministry positions within certain Christian denominations, churches, and parachurch organizations.\n\nMany leadership roles in the organized church have been restricted to males. In the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches, only men may serve as priests or deacons; only males serve in senior leadership positions such as pope, patriarch, and bishop. Women may serve as abbesses. Most mainstream Protestant denominations are beginning to relax their longstanding constraints on ordaining women to be ministers, though some large groups are tightening their constraints in reaction. Charismatic and Pentecostal churches have embraced the ordination of women since their founding.\n\nChristian traditions that officially recognize \"saints\", as persons of exceptional holiness of life having attained the beatific vision (heaven), do list women in that group. Most prominent is Mary, mother of Jesus who is highly revered throughout Christianity, particularly in the Catholic and Orthodox churches where she is considered the \"Theotokos\", i.e. \"Mother of God\", the son born of her, Jesus, being God Incarnate, that is, both God and Man. \nWomen prominent in Christianity have included contemporaries of Jesus, subsequent theologians, abbesses, mystics, doctors of the church, founders of religious orders, military leaders, monarchs and martyrs, evidencing the variety of roles played by women within the life of Christianity. Paul the Apostle held women in high regard and worthy of prominent positions in the church, though he was careful not to encourage disregard for the New Testament household codes, also known as New Testament Domestic Codes or \"Haustafelen\", of Greco-Roman law in the first century.\n\nIn the United Arab Emirates, non-Muslim Western women can wear crop tops, whereas Muslim women are expected to dress much more modestly, due to the injunction on women in Islam to dress modestly at all times when in public. In some Muslim countries, these differences are sometimes even codified in law.\n\nIn some Muslim-majority countries, however, even non-Muslim women are expected to follow Muslim female gender norms and Islamic law to a certain extent, such as by covering their hair. This norm may sometimes be objected to by women visiting from other countries - but they may nevertheless decide to comply on pragmatic grounds, in the interests of their own safety. For example, in Egypt, women who do not dress \"modestly\" - whether they are Muslims or not - may be perceived to be akin to prostitutes by men.\n\nMuhammad described the high status of mothers in both of the major hadith Collections (Bukhari and Muslim). One famous account is:\n\nHindu deities are more ambiguously gendered than deities of other world religions, such as Christianity, Islam, and others. This informs female and males relations, and informs how the differences between males and females are understood However, in a religious cosmology like Hinduism, which prominently features female and androgynous deities, some gender transgression is allowed. This group is known as the hijras, and has a long tradition of performing in important rituals, such as the birth of sons and weddings. Despite this allowance for transgression, Hindu cultural traditions portray women in contradictory ways. On one hand, women's fertility is given great value, and on the other, female sexuality is depicted as potentially dangerous and destructive.\n\nMarriage is an institution that influences gender roles, inequality, and change. In the United States, gender roles are communicated by the media, social interaction, and language. Through these platforms society has influenced individuals to fulfill the stereotypical gender roles within a heterosexual marriage starting out at a young age. Although traditionally, society claims that roles within a heterosexual marriage should be decided based on one's biological sex, today individuals are determining their own roles for themselves, ultimately creating equal partnerships.\n\nIn the U.S., marriage roles are generally decided based on gender. For approximately the past seven decades, heterosexual marriage roles have been defined for men and women based on society's expectations and the influence of the media. Men and women are typically associated with certain social roles dependent upon the personality traits associated with those roles. Traditionally, the role of the homemaker is associated with a woman and the role of a breadwinner is associated with a male. Typically, women are concerned with caring for the family and the home while men are typically providing for the family. This ultimately portrays the man as a leader and the woman as the follower.\n\nIn the U.S., single men are outnumbered by single women at a ratio of 100 single women to 86 single men, though never-married men over the age of 15 outnumber women by a 5:4 ratio (33.9% to 27.3%) according to the 2006 U.S. Census American Community Survey. The results are varied between age groups, with 118 single men per 100 single women in their 20s, versus 33 single men to 100 single women over 65.\n\nThe numbers also vary between countries. For example, China has many more young men than young women, and this disparity is expected to increase. In regions with recent conflict such as Chechnya, women greatly outnumber men.\n\nIn a cross-cultural study by David Buss, men and women were asked to rank the importance of certain traits in a long term partner. Both men and women ranked \"kindness\" and \"intelligence\" as the two most important factors. Men valued beauty and youth more highly than women, while women valued financial and social status more highly than men.\n\nIn today's society, media saturates nearly every aspect of one's life. It seems inevitable for society to be influenced by the media and what it is portraying. Roles are gendered, meaning that both males and females are viewed and treated differently according to their biological sex, and because gendered roles are learned, the media has a direct impact on individuals. Thinking about the way in which couples act on romantic television shows or movies and the way women are portrayed as passive in magazine ads, reveals a lot about how gender roles are viewed in society and in heterosexual marriages. Traditional gendered roles view the man as a “pro-creator, a protector, and a provider,” and the woman as “pretty and polite but not too aggressive, not too outspoken and not too smart.” Media aids in society conforming to these traditional gendered views. People learn through imitation and social-interaction both in the physical world and through the media; television, magazines, advertisements, newspapers, the Internet, etc. Michael Messner argues that \"gendered interactions, structure, and cultural meanings are intertwined, in both mutually reinforcing and contradictory ways.\"\n\nTelevision's influence on society, specifically the influence of television advertisements, is shown in studies such as that of Jörg Matthes, Michael Prieler, and Karoline Adam. Their study into television advertising has shown that women are much more likely to be shown in a setting in the home compared to men. The study also shows that women are shown much less in work-like settings. This underrepresentation in television advertising is seen in many countries around the world but is very present in developed countries. In another study in the \"Journal of Social Psychology,\" many television advertisements in countries around the world are seen targeting women at different times of the day than men. Advertisements for products directed towards female viewers are shown during the day on weekdays, while products for men are shown during weekends. The same article shows that a study on adults and television media has also seen that the more television adults watch, the more likely they are to believe or support the gender roles that are illustrated. The support of the presented gender stereotypes can lead to a negative view of feminism or sexual aggression.\n\nIt has been presented in the journal article by Emerald Group Publishing Limited that adolescent girls have been effected by the stereotypical view of women in media. Girls feel pressurised and stressed to achieve a particular appearance and there have been highly worrying consequences for the young girls if they fail to achieve this look. These consequences have ranged from anxiety to eating disorders. Young girls in an experiment of this journal article describe pictures on women in advertisements as unrealistic and fake. They are dressed in little and revealing clothing which sexualised the women and expose their thin figures, that are gazed upon by the public, creating an issue with stereotyping in the media.\n\nIt has also been presented that children are affected by gender roles in the media. Children's preferences in television characters are most likely to be to characters of the same gender. Because children favor characters of the same gender, the characteristics of the character are also looked to by children.In another journal article by Emerald Group Publishing Limited, the underrepresentation of women in children's television shows between 1930 and 1960 is examined. While studies between 1960 and 1990 show an increase in the representation of women in television, studies conducted between 1990 and 2005, a time when women were considered to be equal to men by some, show no change in the representation of women in children's television shows. Women, being underrepresented in children's television shows, are also often portrayed as married or in a relationship, while men are more likely to be single. This reoccurring theme in relationship status can be reflected in the ideals of children that only see this type of representation. \n\nGendered roles in heterosexual marriages are learned through imitation. People learn what society views as appropriate gender behaviors from imitating the repetition of actions by one's role-model or parent of the same biological sex. Imitation in the physical world that impacts one's gendered roles often comes from role-modeling parents, peers, teachers, and other significant figures in one's life. In a marriage, oftentimes each person's gendered roles are determined by their parents. If the wife grew up imitating the actions of traditional parents, and the husband non-traditional parents, their views on marital roles would be different. One way people can acquire these stereotypical roles through a reward and punishment system. When a little girl imitates her mother by performing the traditional domestic duties she is often rewarded by being told she is doing a good job. Nontraditionally, if a little boy was performing the same tasks he would more likely be punished due to acting feminine. Because society holds these expected roles for men and women within a marriage, it creates a mold for children to follow.\n\nOver the years, gender roles have continued to change and have a significant impact on the institution of marriage. Gender roles can be defined as the behaviors, values, and attitudes that a society considers appropriate for both male and female. Motivated by the women's rights movement and various other movements gender roles have begun to change, resulting in the changing economic landscape, women entering the workplace and many more. Traditionally, men and women had completely opposing roles, men were seen as the provider for the family and women were seen as the caretakers of both the home and the family. However, in today's society the division of roles are starting to blur. More and more individuals are adapting non-traditional gender roles into their marriage in order to share responsibilities. This revolutionary view on gender roles seeks out equality between sexes. In today's society it is more likely that a man and woman are both providers for their family. More and more women are entering the workforce while more men are contributing to household duties. Despite the fact that there is still a gap between gender roles, today, roles are less gendered and more equal in comparison to how they were traditionally.\n\nThroughout history spouses have been charged with certain societal functions. With the rise of the New World came the expected roles that each spouse was to carry out specifically. Husbands were typically working farmers - the providers. Wives typically cared for the home and the children. However, the roles are now changing, and even reversing.\n\nSocieties can change such that the gender roles rapidly change. The 21st century has seen a shift in gender roles due to multiple factors such as new family structures, education, media, and several others. A 2003 survey by the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated that about 1/3 of wives earn more than their husbands.\n\nWith the importance of education emphasized nationwide, and the access of college degrees (online, for example), women have begun furthering their education. Women have also started to get more involved in recreation activities such as sports, which in the past were regarded to be for men. Family structures are changing, and the number of single-mother or single-father households is increasing. Fathers are also becoming more involved with raising their children, instead of the responsibility resting solely with the mother.\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, the number of stay-at-home fathers in the US nearly doubled in the period from 1989 to 2012, from 1.1 million to 2.0 million. This trend appears to be mirrored in a number of countries including the UK, Canada and Sweden. However, Pew also found that, at least in the US, public opinion in general appears to show a substantial bias toward favoring a mother as a care-taker versus a father, regardless of any shift in actual roles each plays.\n\nGender equality allows gender roles to become less distinct and according to Donnalyn Pompper, is the reason \"men no longer own breadwinning identities and, like women, their bodies are objectified in mass media images.\" The LGBT rights movement has played a role increasing pro-gay attitudes, which according to Brian McNair, are expressed by many metrosexual men.\n\nAccording to Professor Lei Chang, gender attitudes within the domains of work and domestic roles, can be measured using a cross-cultural gender role attitudes test. Psychological processes of the East have historically been analysed using Western models (or \"instruments\") that have been translated, which potentially, is a more far-reaching process than linguistic translation. Some North American instruments for assessing gender role attitudes include:\nThrough such tests, it is known that American southerners exhibit less egalitarian gender views than their northern counterparts, demonstrating that gender views are inevitably affected by an individual's culture. This also may differ among compatriots whose 'cultures' are a few hundred miles apart.\n\nAlthough existing studies have generally focused on gender views or attitudes that are work-related, there has so far not been a study on specific domestic roles. Supporting Hofstede's 1980 findings, that \"high masculinity cultures are associated with low percentages of women holding professional and technical employment\", test values for work-related egalitarianism were lower for Chinese than for Americans. This is supported by the proportion of women that held professional jobs in China (far less than that of America), the data clearly indicating the limitations on opportunities open to women in contemporary Eastern society. In contrast, there was no difference between the viewpoint of Chinese and Americans regarding domestic gender roles.\n\nA study by Richard Bagozzi, Nancy Wong and Youjae Yi, examines the interaction between culture and gender that produces distinct patterns of association between positive and negative emotions. The United States was considered a more 'independence-based culture', while China was considered 'interdependence-based'. In the US people tend to experience emotions in terms of opposition whereas in China, they do so in dialectical terms (i.e., those of logical argumentation and contradictory forces). The study continued with sets of psychological tests among university students in Beijing and in Michigan. The fundamental goals of the research were to show that \"gender differences in emotions are adaptive for the differing roles that males and females play in the culture\". The evidence for differences in gender role was found during the socialization in work experiment, proving that \"women are socialized to be more expressive of their feelings and to show this to a greater extent in facial expressions and gestures, as well as by verbal means\". The study extended to the biological characteristics of both gender groups — for a higher association between PA and NA hormones in memory for women, the cultural patterns became more evident for women than for men.\n\nGender communication is viewed as a form of intercultural communication; and gender is both an influence on and a product of communication.\n\nCommunication plays a large role in the process in which people become male or female because each gender is taught different linguistic practices. Gender is dictated by society through expectations of behavior and appearances, and then is shared from one person to another, by the process of communication. Gender does not create communication, communication creates gender.\n\nFor example, females are often more expressive and intuitive in their communication, but males tend to be instrumental and competitive. In addition, there are differences in accepted communication behaviors for males and females. To improve communication between genders, people who identify as either male or female must understand the differences between each gender.\n\nAs found by Cara Tigue (McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada) the importance of powerful vocal delivery for women could not be underestimated, as famously described in accounts of Margaret Thatcher's years in power.)\n\nHall published an observational study on nonverbal gender differences and discussed the cultural reasons for these differences. In her study, she noted women smile and laugh more and have a better understanding of nonverbal cues. She believed women were encouraged to be more emotionally expressive in their language, causing them to be more developed in nonverbal communication.\n\nMen, on the other hand, were taught to be less expressive, to suppress their emotions, and to be less nonverbally active in communication and more sporadic in their use of nonverbal cues. Most studies researching nonverbal communication described women as being more expressively and judgmentally accurate in nonverbal communication when it was linked to emotional expression; other nonverbal expressions were similar or the same for both genders.\n\nMcQuiston and Morris also noted a major difference in men and women's nonverbal communication. They found that men tend to show body language linked to dominance, like eye contact and interpersonal distance, more than women.\n\nAccording to Julia Wood, there are distinct communication 'cultures' for women and men in the US. Wood believes that in addition to female and male communication cultures, there are also specific communication cultures for African Americans, older people, Indian Native Americans, gay men, lesbians, and people with disabilities. According to Wood, it is generally thought that biological sex is behind the distinct ways of communicating, but in reality the root is \"gender\".\n\nMaltz and Broker's research suggested that the games children play may contribute to socializing children into masculine and feminine gender roles: for example, girls being encouraged to play \"house\" may promotes stereotypically feminine traits, and may promote interpersonal relationships as playing house does not necessarily have fixed rules or objectives; boys tended to play more competitive and adversarial team sports with structured, predetermined goals and a range of confined strategies.\n\nMets, et al. explain that sexual desire is linked to emotions and communicative expression. Communication is central in expressing sexual desire and 'complicated emotional states', and is also the 'mechanism for negotiating the relationship implications of sexual activity and emotional meanings'.\n\nGender differences appear to exist in communicating sexual desire, for example, masculine people are generally perceived to be more interested in sex than feminine people, and research suggests that masculine people are more likely than feminine people to express their sexual interest.\n\nThis may be greatly affected by masculine people being less inhibited by social norms for expressing their desire, being more aware of their sexual desire or succumbing to the expectation of their gender culture. When feminine people employ tactics to show their sexual desire, they are typically more indirect in nature. On the other hand, it is known masculinity is associated with aggressive behavior in all mammals, and most likely explains at least part of the fact that masculine people are more likely to express their sexual interest. This is known as the Challenge hypothesis.\n\nVarious studies show different communication strategies with a feminine person refusing a masculine person's sexual interest. Some research, like that of Murnen, show that when feminine people offer refusals, the refusals are verbal and typically direct. When masculine people do not comply with this refusal, feminine people offer stronger and more direct refusals. However, research from Perper and Weis showed that rejection includes acts of avoidance, creating distractions, making excuses, departure, hinting, arguments to delay, etc. These differences in refusal communication techniques are just one example of the importance of communicative competence for both masculine and feminine gender cultures.\n\nA 1992 study tested gender stereotypes and labeling within young children.\n\nFagot \"et al.\" divided this into two different studies, the first investigated how children identified the differences between gender labels of boys and girls, the second study looked at both gender labeling and stereotyping in the relationship of mother and child.\n\nWithin the first study, 23 children between the ages of 2 and 7 underwent a series of gender labelling and gender stereotyping tests consisting of showing the children either pictures of males and females or objects such as a hammer or a broom then identifying or labeling those to a certain gender. The results of these tests showed that children under 3 years could make gender-stereotypic associations.\n\nThe second study looked at gender labelling and stereotyping in the relationship of mother and child using three separate methods. The first consisted of identifying gender labeling and stereotyping, essentially the same method as the first study. The second consisted of behavioral observations, which looked at ten-minute play sessions with mother and child using gender specific toys.\n\nThe third was a series of questionnaires such as an \"Attitude Toward Women Scale\", \"Personal Attributes Questionnaire\", and \"Schaefer and Edgerton Scale\" which looked at the family values of the mother.\n\nThe results of these studies showed the same as the first study with regards to labelling and stereotyping.\n\nThey also identified in the second method that the mothers positive reactions and responses to same-sex or opposite-sex toys played a role in how children identified them. Within the third method the results found that the mothers of the children who passed the “Gender Labeling Test”, had more traditional family values. These two studies, conducted by Beverly I. Fagot, Mar D. Leinbach and Cherie O'Boyle, showed that gender stereotyping and labeling is acquired at a very young age, and that social interactions and associations play a large role in how genders are identified.\n\nVirginia Woolf, in the 1920s, made the point: 'It is obvious that the values of women differ very often from the values which have been made by the other sex. Yet it is the masculine values that prevail' remade sixty years later by psychologist Carol Gilligan who used it to show that psychological tests of maturity have generally been based on masculine parameters, and so tended to show that women were less 'mature'. Gilligan countered this in her ground-breaking work, \"In a Different Voice\", holding that maturity in women is shown in terms of different, but equally important, human values.\n\nGender stereotypes are extremely common in society. One of the reasons this may be is simply because it is easier on the brain to stereotype (see Heuristics).\n\nThe brain has limited perceptual and memory systems, so it categorizes information into fewer and simpler units which allows for more efficient information processing. Gender stereotypes appear to have an effect at an early age. In one study, the effects of gender stereotypes on children's mathematical abilities were tested. In this study of American children between the ages of six and ten, it was found that the children, as early as the second grade, demonstrated the gender stereotype that mathematics is a 'boy's subject'. This may show that the mathematical self-belief is influenced before the age in which there are discernible differences in mathematical achievement.\n\nAccording to the 1972 study by Jean Lipman-Blumen, women who grew up following traditional gender roles from childhood were less likely to want to be highly educated while women brought up with the view that men and women are equal were more likely to want higher education. This result indicates that gender roles that have been passed down traditionally can influence stereotypes about gender.\n\nIn a later study, Deaux and her colleagues (1984) found that most people think women are \"more\" \"nurturant\", but \"less self-assertive\" than men. and that this belief is indicated universally, but that this awareness is related to women's \"role\". To put it another way, women do not have an \"inherently\" nurturant personality, rather that a nurturing personality is acquired by whoever happens to be doing the housework.\n\nIn a study of gender stereotypes by Jacobs (1991) it was found that parents' stereotypes interact with the sex of their child to directly influence the parents' beliefs about the child's abilities. In turn, parents' beliefs about their child directly influence their child's self-perceptions, and both the parents' stereotypes and the child's self-perceptions influence the child's performance.\n\nStereotype threat is being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group. In the case of gender it is the implicit belief in gender stereotype that women perform worse than men in mathematics, which is proposed to lead to lower performance by women.\n\nA review article of stereotype threat research (2012) relating to the relationship between gender and mathematical abilities concluded \"that although stereotype threat may affect some women, the existing state of knowledge does not support the current level of enthusiasm for this [as a] mechanism underlying the gender gap in mathematics\".\n\nIn 2018 Jolien A. van Breen and colleagues conducted research into subliminal gender stereotyping. Researchers took participants through a fictional Moral Choice Dilemma Task, which consisted of eight scenarios \"in which sacrificing one person can save several others of unspecified gender... In four scenarios, participants are asked to sacrifice a man to save several others (of unspecified gender), and in four other scenarios they are asked to sacrifice a woman.\" The results showed that women who identified as feminists were more willing to 'sacrifice' men than women who did not identify as feminists. \"If a person wanted to counteract that and ‘level the playing field’, that can be done either by boosting women or by downgrading men”, said van Breen. “So I think that this effect on evaluations of men arises because our participants are trying to achieve an underlying aim: counteracting gender stereotypes.\"\n\nGender stereotypes are frequently brought up as one disadvantage to women during the hiring process, and as one explanation of the lack of women in key organizational positions.\nManagement and similar leader positions are often perceived to be \"masculine\" in type, meaning they are assumed to require aggressiveness, competitiveness, strength and independence. These traits do not line up with the perceived traditional female gender role stereotype. (This is often referred to as the \"lack of fit\" model which describes the dynamics of the gender bias.) Therefore, the perception that women do not possess these \"masculine\" qualities, limits their ability to be hired or promoted into managerial positions.\n\nOne's performance at work is also evaluated based on one's gender. If a female and a male worker show the same performance, the implications of that performance vary depending on the person's gender and on who observes the performance; if a man performs exceedingly well he is perceived as driven or goal-oriented and generally seen in a positive light while a woman showing a similar performance is often described using adjectives with negative connotations.\nFemale performance is therefore not evaluated neutrally or unbiased and stereotyped in ways to deem their equivalent levels and quality of work as instead of lesser value.\n\nConsequently, that gender stereotype filter leads to a lack of fair evaluation and, in turn, to fewer women occupying higher paying positions. Gender stereotypes contain women at certain, lower levels; getting trapped within the glass ceiling. While the number of women in the workforce occupying management positions is slowly increasing, women currently fill only 2.5% of the higher managerial positions in the United States. The fact that most women are being allocated to occupations that pay less, is often cited as a contributor to the existing gender pay gap.\n\nIn relation to white women, women of color are disproportionally affected by the negative influence their gender has on their chances in the labor market. In 2005, women held only 14.7% of Fortune 500 board seats with 79% of them being white and 21% being women of color. This difference is understood through intersectionality, a term describing the multiple and intersecting oppressions and individual might experience. Activists during second-wave feminism have also used the term \"horizontal oppressions\" to describe this phenomenon. It has also been suggested that women of color in addition to the glass ceiling, face a \"concrete wall\" or a \"sticky floor\" to better visualize the barriers.\n\nLiberal feminist theory states that due to these systemic factors of oppression and discrimination, women are often deprived of equal work experiences because they are not provided equal opportunities on the basis of legal rights. Liberal feminists further propose that an end needs to be put to discrimination based on gender through legal means, leading to equality and major economic redistributions.\n\nWhile activists have tried calling on Title VII to provide an equal hiring and promotional process, that practice has had limited success. The pay gap between men and women is slowly closing. Women make approximately 21% less than her male counterpart according to the Department of Labor. This number varies by age, race, and other perceived attributes of hiring agents. A proposed step towards solving the problem of the gender pay gap and the unequal work opportunities is the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment which would constitutionally guarantee equal rights for women. This is hoped to end gender-based discrimination and provide equal opportunities for women.\n\nIf a woman \"does\" act according to female stereotypes, she is likely to receive backlash for not being competent enough; if she does \"not\" act according to the stereotypes connected to her gender and behaves more androgynous, or even masculine, it is likely to cause backlash through third-party punishment or further job discrimination. Therefore, women are expected to behave in a way that aligns with female gender stereotypes while these stereotypes are simultaneously used to justify their lack of success in an economic context, putting women in the workforce in a precarious, \"double bind\" situation. A proposed step to relieve women from this issue is the above-mentioned ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, as it would legally further gender equality and prohibit gender-based discrimination regardless if a woman is acting according to female gender stereotypes or in defiance of them.\n\nRosabeth Moss Kanter identified four types of stereotypes given to professional women via the media. The four stereotypes are, iron maiden, pet, mother, and seductress/sex object. Iron maiden refers to women who are deemed to display too many masculine traits and not enough feminine traits according to her audience. This leads audiences to question the trustworthiness of an iron maiden, because she is seen as strategically playing the field to appease voters. The pet stereotype is given to women who are identified as helpmates, cheerleaders, or mascots, which then leads the audience to see these women as naive or weak and unable to lead without a man's help. If a professional woman is seen as a mother, she is more likely to be seen as compassionate and caring, but also has the capacity to be shrew, punishing, and scolding. Additionally, it is possible for her leadership abilities to be called into question due to perceived conflicts with her maternal responsibilities. The fourth stereotype, seductress, is assigned to women who speak and act rather femininely, or have been victims of sexual harassment. The media tends to focus on the seductress woman's sex appeal and physical appearance in opposition to her policy stances and rhetoric.\n\nA proposed step to relieve women from that double bind is the above-mentioned ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, as it would further legal gender equality and prohibit gender-based discrimination, regardless if a woman is acting according to female gender stereotypes or in defiance of them.\n\nGender stereotypes and roles can also be supported implicitly. Implicit stereotypes are the unconscious influence of attitudes a person may or may not be aware that they hold. A person is influenced by these attitudes even though they are not aware. Gender stereotypes can also be held in this manner.\n\nThese implicit stereotypes can often be demonstrated by the Implicit-association test (IAT).\n\nOne example of an implicit gender stereotype is that males are seen as better at mathematics than females. It has been found that men have stronger positive associations with mathematics than women, while women have stronger negative associations with mathematics and the more strongly a woman associates herself with the female gender identity, the more negative her association with mathematics.\n\nThese associations have been disputed for their biological connection to gender and have been attributed to social forces that perpetuate stereotypes such as aforementioned stereotype that men are better at mathematics than women.\n\nThis particular stereotype has been found in American children as early as second grade.\n\nThe same test with Singaporean children found that the strength of their mathematics-gender stereotype and their gender identity predicted the association between individuals and mathematical ability.\n\nIt has been shown that this stereotype also reflects mathematical performance: a study was done on the worldwide scale and it was found that the strength of this mathematics-gender stereotype in varying countries correlates with 8th graders' scores on the TIMSS, a standardized math and science achievement test that is given worldwide. The results were controlled for general gender inequality and yet were still significant.\n\nAn example of gender stereotypes assumes those of the male gender are more 'tech savvy' and happier working online, however, a study done by Hargittai & Shafer, shows that many women also typically have lower self-perceived abilities when it comes to use of the World Wide Web and online navigation skills. Because this stereotype is so well known many women assume they lack such technical skills when in reality, the gap in technological skill level between men and women is significantly less than many women assume.\n\nIn the journal article written by Elizabeth Behm-Morawitz video games have been guilty of using sexualised female characters, who wear revealing clothing with an 'ideal' figure. It has been shown, female gamers can experience lower self-efficacy when playing a game with a sexualized female character. Women have been stereotyped in online games and have shown to be quite sexist in their appearance. It has been shown these kind of character appearances have influenced peoples' beliefs about gender capabilities by assigning certain qualities to the male and female characters in different games.\n\nThe concept of gender inequality is often perceived as something that is non-existent within the online community, because of the anonymity possible online. Remote or home-working greatly reduces the volume of information one individual gives another compared to face-to-face encounters, providing fewer opportunities for unequal treatment but it seems real-world notions of power and privilege are being duplicated: people who choose to take up different identities (avatars) in the online world are (still) routinely discriminated against, evident in online gaming where users are able to create their own characters. This freedom allows the user to create characters and identities with a different appearance than their own in reality, essentially allowing them to create a new identity, confirming regardless of actual gender those who are perceived to be female are treated differently because of their on-line gender identity.\n\nIn marked contrast to the traditional male-dominated stereotype a study shows that 52% of the gaming audience is made up of women and a minority of gaming characters are women. Only 12% of game designers in Britain and 3% of all programmers are women.\n\nDespite the growing number of women who partake in online communities, and the anonymous space provided by the Internet, issues such as gender inequality, the issue has simply been transplanted into the online world.\n\nEven though the number of women running for elected office has increased over the last decades, they still only make up 20% of U.S. senators, 19.4% of U.S. congressional representatives and 24% of statewide executives. Additionally, many of these political campaigns appear to focus on the aggressiveness of the female candidate which is often still perceived as a masculine trait. Therefore, female candidates are running based on gender-opposing stereotypes because that predicts higher likelihood of success than appearing to be a stereotypical woman.\n\nElections of increasing numbers of women into office serves as a basis for many scholars to claim that voters are not biased towards a candidate's gender. However, it has been shown that female politicians are perceived as only being superior when it comes to handling women's rights and poverty, whereas male politicians are perceived to be better at dealing with crime and foreign affairs. That view lines up with the most common gender stereotypes.\n\nIt has also been predicted that gender does only highly matter for female candidates that have not been politically established. These predictions apply further to established candidates, stating that gender would not be a defining factor for their campaign or the focal point of media coverage. This has been disproven by multiple scholars, often based on Hillary Clinton's multiple campaigns for the office of President of the United States.\n\nAdditionally, when voters don't have a lot of information about a female candidate, they are likely to view her as being a stereotypical woman which they often take as a basis for not electing her because they consider typical male qualities as being crucial for someone holding a political office.\n\nThroughout the 20th century, women in the United States saw a dramatic shift in social and professional aspirations and norms. Following the Women's Suffrage Movement of the late-nineteenth century, which resulted in the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment allowing women to vote, and in combination with conflicts in Europe, WWI and WWII, women found themselves shifted into the industrial workforce. During this time, women were expected to take up industrial jobs and support the troops abroad through the means of domestic industry. Moving from \"homemakers\" and \"caregivers\", women were now factory workers and \"breadwinners\" for the family.\n\nHowever, after the war, men returned home to the United States and women, again, saw a shift in social and professional dynamics. With the reuniting of the nuclear family, the ideals of American Suburbia boomed. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, middle-class families moved in droves from urban living into newly developed single-family homes on former farmland just outside major cities. Thus established what many modern critics describe as the \"private sphere\". Though frequently sold and idealized as “perfect living”, many women had difficulty adjusting to the new “private sphere.” Writer Betty Friedan described this discontent as “the feminine mystique.” The “mystique” was derived from women equipped with the knowledge, skills, and aspirations of the workforce, the “public sphere”, who felt compelled whether socially or morally to devote themselves to the home and family.\n\nOne major concern of feminism, is that women occupy lower-ranking job positions than men, and do most of the housework. A recent (October 2009) report from the Center for American Progress, \"The Shriver Report: A Woman's Nation Changes Everything\" tells us that women now make up 48% of the US workforce and \"mothers are breadwinners or co-breadwinners in a majority of families\" (63.3%, see figure 2, page 19 of the Executive Summary of The Shriver Report).\nAnother recent article in \"The New York Times\" indicates that young women today are closing the pay gap. Luisita Lopez Torregrosa has noted, \"Women are ahead of men in education (last year, 55 percent of U.S. college graduates were female). And a study shows that in most U.S. cities, single, childless women under 30 are making an average of 8 percent more money than their male counterparts, with Atlanta and Miami in the lead at 20 percent.\". While this study concerned American cities, a global trend is developing, and has now been termed \"the reverse gender gap.\"\n\nFeminist theory generally defines gender as a social construct that includes ideologies governing feminine/masculine (female/male) appearances, actions, and behaviors. An example of these gender roles would be that males were supposed to be the educated breadwinners of the family, and occupiers of the public sphere whereas, the female's duty was to be a homemaker, take care of her husband and children, and occupy the private sphere. According to contemporary gender role ideology, gender roles are continuously changing. This can be seen in Londa Schiebinger's \"Has Feminism Changed Science\", in which she states, \"Gendered characteristics - typically masculine or feminine behaviors, interests, or values-are not innate, nor are they arbitrary. They are formed by historical circumstances. They can also change with historical circumstances.\"\n\nOne example of the contemporary definition of gender was depicted in Sally Shuttleworth’s \"Female Circulation\" in which the, “abasement of the woman, reducing her from an active participant in the labor market to the passive bodily existence to be controlled by male expertise is indicative of the ways in which the ideological deployment of gender roles operated to facilitate and sustain the changing structure of familial and market relations in Victorian England.” In other words, this shows what it meant to grow up into the roles (gender roles) of a female in Victorian England, which transitioned from being a homemaker to being a working woman and then back to being passive and inferior to males. In conclusion, gender roles in the contemporary sex gender model are socially constructed, always changing, and do not really exist since, they are ideologies that society constructs in order for various benefits at various times in history.\n\nThe men's rights movement (MRM) is a part of the larger men's movement. It branched off from the men's liberation movement in the early-1970s. The men's rights movement is made up of a variety of groups and individuals who are concerned about what they consider to be issues of male disadvantage, discrimination and oppression. The movement focuses on issues in numerous areas of society (including family law, parenting, reproduction, domestic violence) and government services (including education, compulsory military service, social safety nets, and health policies) that they believe discriminate against men.\n\nScholars consider the men's rights movement or parts of the movement to be a backlash to feminism. The men's rights movement denies that men are privileged relative to women. The movement is divided into two camps: those who consider men and women to be harmed equally by sexism, and those who view society as endorsing the degradation of men and upholding female privilege.\n\nMen's rights groups have called for male-focused governmental structures to address issues specific to men and boys including education, health, work and marriage. Men's rights groups in India have called for the creation of a Men's Welfare Ministry and a National Commission for Men, as well as the abolition of the National Commission for Women. In the United Kingdom, the creation of a Minister for Men analogous to the existing Minister for Women, have been proposed by David Amess, MP and Lord Northbourne, but were rejected by the government of Tony Blair. In the United States, Warren Farrell heads a commission focused on the creation of a \"White House Council on Boys and Men\" as a counterpart to the \"White House Council on Women and Girls\" which was formed in March 2009.\n\nRelated to this is the Father's Rights Movement, whose members seek social and political reforms that affect fathers and their children. These individuals contest that societal institutions such as family courts, and laws relating to child custody and child support payments, are gender biased in favor of mothers as the default caregiver. They therefore are systemically discriminatory against males regardless of their actual caregiving ability, because males are typically seen as the bread-winner, and females as the care-giver.\n\nGender neutrality is the movement to end discrimination of gender altogether in society through means of gender neutral language, the end of sex segregation and other means.\n\nTransgender is the state of one's gender identity or gender expression not matching one's assigned sex. Transgender is independent of sexual orientation; transgender people may identify as heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, etc.; some may consider conventional sexual orientation labels inadequate or inapplicable to them. The definition of \"transgender\" includes:\n\nWhile people self-identify as transgender, the transgender identity umbrella includes sometimes-overlapping categories. These include transsexual; transvestite or cross-dresser; genderqueer; androgyne; and bigender. Usually not included are transvestic fetishists (because it is considered to be a paraphilia rather than gender identification), and drag kings and drag queens, who are performers who cross-dress for the purpose of entertaining. In an interview, celebrity drag queen RuPaul talked about society's ambivalence to the differences in the people who embody these terms. \"A friend of mine recently did the \"Oprah\" show about transgender youth\", said RuPaul. \"It was obvious that we, as a culture, have a hard time trying to understand the difference between a drag queen, transsexual, and a transgender, yet we find it very easy to know the difference between the American baseball league and the National baseball league, when they are both so similar.\"\n\nSexual orientation is defined by the interplay between a person's emotional and physical attraction toward others. Generally, sexual orientation is broken into the three categories: heterosexual, homosexual and bisexual. By basic definition, the term heterosexual is typically used in reference to someone who is attracted to people of the opposite sex, the term homosexual is used to classify people who are attracted to those of the same sex, and the term bisexual is used to identify those who are attracted to both the same and opposite sexes. However, some argue that sexual orientation is better defined as a continuum with those three categories represented. This idea was first proposed by sexologist Alfred Kinsey in 1948. After conducting a series of interviews, Kinsey and his team of researchers concluded that most people fell somewhere on a spectrum between strictly heterosexual and strictly homosexual. Their findings suggested that sexual orientation was more fluid than once believed.\n\nSexual orientation is developed based on the three components of sexual identity, sexual behavior and sexual attraction. Each component is independent so no other conclusions can be drawn based on one another.\n\nAn active conflict over the cultural acceptability of non-heterosexuality rages worldwide. The belief or assumption that heterosexual relationships and acts are \"normal\" is described as heterosexism or in queer theory, heteronormativity. Gender identity and sexual orientation are two separate aspects of individual identity, although they are often mistaken in the media.\n\nPerhaps it is an attempt to reconcile this conflict that leads to a common assumption that one same-sex partner assumes a pseudo-male gender role and the other assumes a pseudo-female role. For a gay male relationship, this might lead to the assumption that the \"wife\" handled domestic chores, was the receptive sexual partner, adopted effeminate mannerisms, and perhaps even dressed in women's clothing. This assumption is flawed because homosexual couples tend to have more equal roles, and the effeminate behavior of some gay men is usually not adopted consciously, and is often more subtle.\n\nCohabitating same-sex partners are typically egalitarian when they assign domestic chores. Sometimes these couples assign traditional female responsibilities to one partner and traditional male responsibilities to the other. Same-sex domestic partners challenge traditional gender roles in their division of household responsibilities, and gender roles within homosexual relationships are flexible. For instance, cleaning and cooking, traditionally regarded by many as both female responsibilities, might be assigned to different people. Carrington observed the daily home lives of 52 gay and lesbian couples and found that the length of the work week and level of earning power substantially affected the assignment of housework, regardless of gender or sexuality.\nIn many cultures, gender roles, especially for men, simultaneously act as an indicator for heterosexuality, and as a boundary of acceptable behavior for straight people. Therefore, lesbians, gay men and bisexual people may be viewed as exempt from some or all components of gender roles or as having different \"rules\" they are expected to follow by society.\n\nThese modified \"rules\" for lesbian, gay and bisexual people may also be oppressive. Morgan examines the plight of homosexuals seeking asylum from homophobic persecution who have been turned away by US customs for \"not being gay enough\"; not conforming sufficiently to standard (Western) conceptions of the gender roles occupied by gays and lesbians.\n\nConversely, heterosexual men and women who are not perceived as being sufficiently masculine or feminine, respectively, may be assumed to be, or suspected to be, homosexual, and persecuted for their perceived homosexuality.\n\nA number of studies conducted since the mid-90s have found direct correlation between a female criminal's ability to conform to gender role stereotypes, particularly murder, and the severity of their sentencing. \"...In terms of the social realities of justice in America, the experiences of diverse groups of people in society have contributed to the shaping of the types of criminals and victims that we have had. Like Andersen and Hill Collins (1998: 4) in their discussion of what they refer to as a 'matrix of domination,' we too conceive that class, race, and gender represent \"multiple, interlocking levels of domination that stem from the societal configurations of these structural relationships. These patterned actions, in turn, affect [ing] individual consciousness, group interaction, and individual and group access to institutional power and privileges.'\" \"Patterns of offending by men and by women are notable both for their similarities and for their differences. Both men and women are more heavily involved in minor property and substance abuse offenses than in serious crimes like robbery or murder. However, men offend at much higher rates than women for all crime categories except prostitution. This gender gap in crime is greatest for serious crime and least for mild forms of lawbreaking such as minor property crimes.\" \n\nThe ‘Family Violence Framework’ applies gender dynamics to family violence. “Families are constructed around relationships that involve obligations and responsibilities, but also status and power”. According to Hattery and Smith, when “masculinity and femininity are constructed…to generate these rigid and narrow gender roles, it contributes to a culture of violence against women” “People with more resources are more likely to be abusive towards those without resources”, meaning that the stronger member of the relationship abuses their weaker partner or family member to exert their powerful roles. However, the fight for power and equality remains – “Intimate partner violence in same-sex couples reveals that the rates are similar to those in the heterosexual community”.\n\n"}
{"id": "13236423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13236423", "title": "Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act", "text": "Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act\n\nAn Act To Protect Heritage Lighthouses (), officially known as Bill S-215, is a federal act to designate and preserve historically significant Canadian lighthouses. It was passed by the Canadian Parliament in May 2008. The act set up a public nomination process and sets heritage building conservation standards for lighthouses which are officially designated. First introduced in 2000 as Bill S-21 in the Senate of Canada the bill enjoyed consistent multi-party support despite the unpredictable legislative agendas of minority Parliaments and was repeatedly re-introduced. The final vote of approval was made by the Canadian Senate in 2008 and the bill received Royal Assent on May 29, 2008.\n\nThe Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act (S.C. 2008, c. 16) came into effect on May 29, 2010 and established a deadline of May 29, 2012 to nominate lighthouses for heritage designation. However an announcement in June 2010 to declare almost all Canadian lighthouses as surplus caused critics to accuse the Canadian Coast Guard of emasculating the bill.\n\nThe first designations under the Act were announced on 3 August 2012: the St. Paul Island (Nova Scotia) in Dingwall, and three in Saugeen Shores, Ontario, McNab Point and both the Front and Rear Range lights at the Saugeen River Front. As of February 2017, a total of 92 lighthouses had been designated.\n\nWith the world's largest coastline, Canada built a large network of lighthouses and developed a unique Canadian style of lighthouses following Confederation in 1867. Advances in navigational technology have lessened the critical navigational role of lighthouses while at the same time their cultural role and potential for tourism development has grown. Lighthouse groups seeking to preserve lighthouses soon found that in Canada, the landmark buildings fell into a heritage Catch-22. As federal buildings, they are exempt from municipal or provincial laws, but they are not protected by any federal heritage laws. Lighthouses are instead merely subject to a property management program called the Federal Heritage Building Review Office (FHBRO). A survey of lighthouses across Canada in 1998 by the Nova Scotia Lighthouse Preservation Society showed that fewer than 4 per cent of Canadian lighthouses have been protected from demolition under FHBRO, while in the United States, 70 percent of lighthouses over 50 years old have heritage protection by the National Register of Historic Places. The FHBRO process has also been criticized for lack of public consultation with most communities having no idea when local lighthouses were evaluated and for the fact that when lighthouses are sold privately or transferred to other levels of government, even the minimal FHBRO protection evaporates.\n\nThis lack of protection for heritage lighthouses was first felt in Nova Scotia, the Canadian province with the largest number of lighthouses. So many were facing demolition and neglect, that a campaign for federal legislation to protect lighthouses was launched by the Nova Scotia Lighthouse Preservation Society at the Chebucto Head lighthouse near Halifax on March 11, 1999. A committee of the society soon networked with other lighthouse groups in Atlantic Canada, Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, organizing a letter campaign to the Canadian Heritage Minister and every Member of Parliament and Senator to ask for legislation creating a \"Lighthouse Protection Act\".\nMany politicians responded positively but the leadership for the bill emerged from a fitting East Coast/West Coast partnership of two Canadian Senators, Mike Forrestall from Nova Scotia and Pat Carney from British Columbia. Forrestall first introduced the Bill in 2000, noting that lighthouses were neglected national symbols, \"The government was hell-bent on tearing them down or abandoning them.\"\n\nThe bill is modeled on the successful Heritage Railway Stations Protection Act passed by Parliament in 1988 which has proven a success in preserving railway heritage buildings.\n\nUnder the bill the Minister responsible for the Parks Canada Agency sets criteria to designate a heritage lighthouse, based on historical, architectural, and community values. The Minister is guided by specific criteria and the advice of an advisory committee. Before a lighthouse that has been declared surplus by the government can be designated, a group must provide a written commitment to Fisheries and Oceans Canada to acquire it, protect is heritage characteristics and to make use of it in a manner that will be financially viable. Parks Canada published full specifics about the program on its Web site.\n\nRenovations at a designated lighthouse must meet heritage building criteria established by the minister based on national and international standards for the conservation of heritage properties. An exception is made for renovations in emergency circumstance or for urgent operational requirements for the lighthouse's navigational role.\nThe heritage character of the lighthouse must still be protected even if a lighthouse is sold or transferred to another level of government. A heritage lighthouse may not be demolished unless \"there is no reasonable alternative\". An exception is made for demolitions in emergency circumstance or for urgent operational requirements. Both the sale and demolition of a designated lighthouse would require public consultation.\n\nAn Act To Protect Heritage Lighthouses was first introduced by the late Senator Mike Forrestall of Nova Scotia as a Private Member's Bill (S-21) in 2000. It was brought it forward three more times, as S-7, then as S-14, then as S-41 which was given Third Reading by the Senate on March 23, 2005. The House of Commons debated the bill in June 2005 in Second Reading and referred it to the Standing Committee on the Environment and Sustainable Development for clause-by-clause review. The bill died on the Order Paper when the federal election of January 2006 was called. Following the death of Senator Forrestall in June 2006, the bill was re-introduced as Bill-S220 in October 2006 by Senator Pat Carney of British Columbia. The Bill was given Third Reading and passed by the Senate on December 14, 2006. \nThe bill was first sponsored in the House of Commons by Conservative Member of Parliament Gerald Keddy. It passed Second Reading on June 13, 2007 and was scheduled to be reviewed by the House of Commons Fisheries Committee in October 2007 before Third and Final Reading. However, the announcement on September 4 that Parliament would be prorogued in October put the bill back to the Senate where on October 30 Pat Carney re-introduced it as Bill S-215. The Bill passed Third Reading in the Senate on December 13, 2007 and was re-introduced in the House of Commons by Conservative Member of Parliament Larry Miller where it passed 2nd Reading on March 11, 2008. The bill was referred to committee where an amendment were made to define lighthouse structures and limit the act to federally owned lighthouses. The Third and final Commons vote was made on May 1, 2008 followed by a Senate vote to approve the amendment which the bill passed on May 8. Royal Assent was given on May 29, 2008.\n\nThe Act came into effect on May 29, 2010, two years after Royal Assent.\n\nThe bill enjoyed consistent multi-party support from its Conservative sponsors but also Liberals such as Newfoundland MP Scott Simms and New Democratic Party MP Peter Stoffer who withdrew his own private members bill to protect lighthouses in support of S-220. Other MPs such as Catherine Bell from British Columbia welcomed an initiative to preserving a national landmark as a healthy alternative to contentious partisan issues of a minority Parliament. The only formal opposition was voiced by a Bloc Quebecois MP Raynald Blais who said he could not support the bill because it might mask federal neglect of other DFO responsibilities.\nIn addition to regional lighthouse advocates such as the Nova Scotia Lighthouse Preservation Society, the Heritage Canada Foundation was a consistent supporter noting that lighthouses need special protection because of the lack of federal legislation for any federal buildings.\n\nDespite the broad public support for the bill, some federal departmental staff initially opposed the bill suggesting it could cost up to $384 million to upgrade all of Canada's lighthouses to heritage standards. Supporters of the bill called these numbers inflated, pointing out that it assumes that every pieces of navigational equipment in the country, including hundreds of steel towers and floating buoys, would be designated whereas even the strongest proponents only anticipate the nomination of a select number of landmark lighthouses. They also noted that the bill leaves control of the number of designations, and any associated, costs, with the minister.\n\nParks Canada assigned staff and set up a program for heritage lighthouses following the passage of the act. Beginning in May 2010 communities became eligible to nominate lighthouses for designation. Communities had two years to nominate lighthouses as nominations closed on June 29, 2012. By the fall of 2010, 22 lighthouses had been nominated, mostly in Ontario including Chantry Island Lightstation Tower, one of the first to be nominated. It has yet to be designated because ownership cannot be transferred from the federal government to the Town of Saugeen Shores due to the uncertainty created by First Nations land claims to islands in the Lake Huron basin.\nThe move in June 2010 to dispose of almost all lighthouses in Canada, even operational lighthouses, caused controversy. Critics noted that as non-federal lighthouse are not covered by the Act, the move to disposal proposal essentially \"emasculates\" the Act. Other groups have pointed out that the Act is being used as a disposal mechanism for lighthouses contrary to its original intent. Critics included the Senate Committee on Fisheries and Oceans. In late 2010, Committee chair Bill Rompkey of Newfoundland and Labrador said the sell-off defeats the purpose of the act and called for the nomination process to be extended. As of May 2015, 970 had been declared surplus; 348 of those were the subject of public petitions for preservation under the Act.\nThe announcement required that any group that nominates a lighthouses must buy or take ownership of it. In other words, according to the \"Chronicle Herald\", the Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act \"seeks to divest the structures to new owners\".\n\nOf the 90 lighthouses that had been designated under the Act as of September 2016, 42 were still being managed by the federal government and 48 were being managed by other owners, such as community groups.\n\nThe designation process has continued well beyond 2015. For example, a full 13 were protected in July 2016 under the Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act. Subsequently, Marc Seguin of the non-profit group Save Our Lighthouses told Radio Canada that there were over 500 others that could be designated. An additional two were protected in February 2017 for a total of 92, in eight provinces, as of that date. A full list of lighthouses protected to date is published (and updated as required) on the Parks Canada web site.\n\n\n"}

His demonym 'al-Siqillī' indicates he was born in Sicily, but the patronym 'al-Makkī' suggests his family origins were in Mecca, where he is believed to have been raised and educated. Nicknamed 'The Wanderer', the precise chronology of his travels are uncertain. He probably spent his youth in Fatimid Egypt and Mahdia in Tunisia, but left there in 1148 when it fell to the Normans. After a period in Sicily, Ibn Ẓafar first went to Egypt, then to Aleppo in 1146, where he taught at the Madrasa Ibn Abī ‘Aṣrūn under the patronage of Ṣāfīal-Dīn. In 1154 he returned to Sicily under the patronage of Amīr Abū ‘Abd Allāh Ibn Abī al-Qāsim Ibn ‘Alī al-Qurashī, known as Ibn Hajar, a Sicilian Arab noble, who served as a general in the Norman army. Due to the civil unrest of the Muslim population some time later, Ibn Ẓafar left Sicily definitively and took refuge in Hamat, in Syria, where he died in poverty in 1170, or 1172. The geographer Yāqūt al-Rūmī referred to him as a ‘refined philologist’, and both Shams al-Dīn al-Dhahabī and Ibn Khallikān praised his scholarship and thought.\n\nIbn Ẓafar was said to have authored 32 books\n\n\"Sulwān al-Muṭā fī Udwān al-Atbā\" () (Consolation for the Ruler During the Hostility of his Subjects) is his magnum opus. When Niccolò Machiavelli, the famous Florentine, dedicated his treatise, 'The Prince', to Lorenzo di Medici four centuries later, Ibn Ẓafar was almost unknown to the Western world. He remained in relative obscurity even after Michele Amari's Italian translation appeared in 1851. Amari's introduction had included a biographical account of Ibn Ẓafar and his manuscript's history, and Richard Bentley published an English version in 1852. At the beginning of the 20th century another Sicilian and political scientist philosopher, Gaetano Mosca, wrote of the striking parallels between Ibn Ẓafar's treatise and Machiavelli's. Ibn Ẓafar's name is rarely credited as the precursor to its famous successor.\n\nThe treatise is a form of Wisdom literature with a long Arabian and Persian tradition, called 'Mirrors for princes', which purported to be handbooks for princes and caliphs offering counsel on the proper use of power, good governance and the conduct of commerce and trade. Ibn Ẓafar dedicated the first edition of 'Sulwan' to an unknown king facing revolt - possibly the ruler of Damascus expelled by Nur Eddin - and the second edition to his patron Abū al-Qāsim (Ibn Hajar).\n\n\"A Biography of Illustrious Men\", translated into Italian, English and Turkish.\n\n"}
{"id": "18546373", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18546373", "title": "Inoculation theory", "text": "Inoculation theory\n\nInoculation theory was developed by social psychologist William J. McGuire in 1961 to explain how attitudes and beliefs change, and more importantly, how to keep existing attitudes and beliefs consistent in the face of attempts to change them. Inoculation theory functions as a strategy to protect attitudes from change–to confer resistance to counter-attitudinal influences, whether such influences take the form of direct attacks or sustained pressures.\n\nThe theory posits that weak counterarguments–arguments that are easily refuted–generate resistance within the receiver, enabling them to maintain their beliefs in the face of a future, stronger, attack. Following exposure to weak counterarguments, the inoculation receiver will then seek out supporting information to further strengthen their threatened position. Finally, the held attitude or belief becomes resistant to a stronger attack, hence the medical analogy of a vaccine.\n\nInoculation is a theory developed to strengthen existing attitudes and beliefs while building resistance to future counterarguments. For inoculation to be successful it is crucial that a threat (motivation for resistance) is imposed upon these existing ideas and refutational preemption (ability to build defenses against potential counterarguments) takes place after the inoculation. The argument that is presented through inoculation must be strong enough to initiate motivation to maintain current attitudes and beliefs, but weak enough that the receiver will refute the counterargument (Compton, 2013; McGuire, 1964). Inoculation has been proven successful through trials and research. This article highlights vital aspects of inoculation theory, however, it is not exhaustive–there is a large volume of quality research on the theory not mentioned. Finally, while numerous studies have tested and verified the efficacy of the inoculation process, there continues to be a need for refinement and elaboration.\n\nInoculation theory is used today as part of the suite of tools used by those engaged in shaping or manipulating public opinion. These contexts include: politics (e.g., Pfau et al., 1990; see Compton & Ivanov, 2013, for a review), health campaigns (e.g., Pfau & VanBockern, 1994; see Compton, Jackson, & Dimmock, 2016, for a review), marketing (e.g., Compton & Pfau, 2004) and education (Compton, 2011), among others. (See Banas & Rains, 2010, for a meta-analysis, and Compton, 2013, for a narrative overview.)\n\nThe inoculation process is analogous to the medical inoculation process from which it draws its name; the analogy served as the inaugural exemplar for how inoculation confers resistance. As McGuire (1961) initially explained, medical inoculation works by exposing the body to a weakened form of a virus—strong enough to trigger a response (i.e., the production of antibodies), but not so strong as to overwhelm the body's resistance. Attitudinal inoculation works the same way: Expose the receiver to weakened counterarguments, triggering a process of counterargument which confers resistance to later, stronger persuasive messages. This process works like a metaphorical vaccination: the receiver becomes immune to attacking messages that attempt to change their attitudes or beliefs regarding the initial threat. Inoculation theory suggests that if one sends out messages with weak counterarguments, an individual can build immunity to those messages and strengthen their original attitudes. It uses a threat on initial beliefs to trigger a person's desire to fight against the threat, ultimately reinforcing their attitude.\n\nWilliam McGuire set out to conduct research “on ways of inducing resistance to persuasion, under the impression that while much experimental work was being done on factors that increased persuasive effectiveness, little was being done on ways of producing resistance to persuasion” (McGuire, 1964, p. 192). McGuire was motivated to study inoculation and persuasion as a result of the aftermath of the Korean War. Nine US prisoners of war, when given the opportunity, elected to remain with their captors. Many assumed they were brainwashed, so McGuire and other social scientists turned to ways of conferring resistance to persuasion (Dewey, 2017). This was a change in extant persuasion research, which was almost exclusively concerned with how to make messages more persuasive, and not the other way around (Gass & Seiter, 2003). \n\nThe theory of inoculation was derived from previous research studying one-sided and two-sided messages. One-sided messages are supportive messages to strengthen existing attitudes, but with no mention of counterpositions. One-sided messages are frequently seen in political campaigns when a candidate denigrates his or her opponent through \"mudslinging\". This method is effective in reinforcing extant attitudes of derision toward the opposition and support for the \"mudslinging\" candidate. If the audience supports the opposition, however, the attack message is ineffective. Two-sided messages present both counterarguments and refutations of those counterarguments. To gain compliance and source credibility, a two-sided message must demonstrate the sender's position, then the opposition's position, followed by a refutation of the opposition's argument, then finally the sender's position again (Lumsdaine & Janis, 1953).\n\nSince its creation, the uses of inoculation theory have been expanded in the areas of health, political, educational and commercial messaging. When McGuire (1966a) created this theory, it was applied to social clichés. This meant it was primarily used toward the attitudes that were rarely, if ever attacked by opposing forces. The early tests of inoculation theory were used on non-controversial issues, (e.g. brushing your teeth is good for you). Few refute that brushing one's teeth is a good habit, therefore external opposing arguments against tooth brushing would not change one's opinion, but it would strengthen support for brushing one's teeth (Banas & Rains, 2010). Inoculation theory studies currently target less popular or common attitudes, such as whether one should buy a Mac or a Windows-based PC computer or if one should support gay marriage. Implementing inoculation theory in studies of contemporary social issues (from mundane to controversial social issues), the variety and resurgence of studies using inoculation theory helps bolster the effectiveness and utility of the theory and provides support that it can be used to strengthen and/or predict attitudes.\n\nMcGuire led a series of experiments assessing inoculation's efficacy and adding nuance to our understanding for how it works (for a review, see Compton, 2013; Compton & Pfau, 2005). Early studies (e.g., McGuire & Papageorgis, 1961) limited testing of inoculation theory to cultural truisms, or beliefs accepted without consideration (e.g., people should brush their teeth daily). Later development of the theory extended inoculation to more controversial and contested topics in the contexts of politics (see Compton & Ivanov, 2013), health (see Compton, Jackson, & Dimmock, 2015), marketing, and contexts in which people have different pre-existing attitudes, such as climate change. The theory has also been applied in education to help prevent substance abuse.\n\nAdditionally, more recent research has examined inoculation's effects on targets besides attitudes, including task self-efficacy (Jackson, Compton, Whiddett, Anthony, & Dimmock, 2015). Other work has confirmed that inoculation's efficacy can be boosted with other persuasion processes, like reactance (Miller et al., 2013).\n\nInoculation theory states that to prevent persuasion it is necessary to strengthen preexisting attitudes, beliefs, or opinions. First, the receiver must be made aware of the potential vulnerability of an existing position (e.g., attitude, belief). This establishes threat and initiates defenses to future attacks. The idea is that when a weak argument is presented in the inoculation message, processes of refutation or other means of protection will prepare for stronger arguments later. It is critical that the attack is strong enough to keep the receiver defensive, but weak enough to not actually change those preexisting ideas. This will hopefully make the receiver actively defensive and allow them to create arguments in favor of their preexisting thoughts. The more active the receiver becomes in his or her defense the more it will strengthen their own attitudes, beliefs, or opinions (McGuire, 1964).\n\nThere are four basic key components to successful inoculation: threat, refutational preemption, delay, and involvement. The first is threat, which provides motivation to protect one's attitudes or beliefs (Pfau, 1997a). Threat is a product of the presence of counterarguments in an inoculation message and/or an explicit forewarning of an impending challenge to an existing belief (see Compton & Ivanov, 2012). The message receiver must interpret that a message is threatening and recognize that there is a reason to fight to maintain and strengthen their opinion. If the receiver of an opposing message does not recognize that a threat is present, they will not feel the need to start defending their position and therefore will not change their attitude or strengthen their opinion (Banas & Rains, 2010, p. 285). Compton and Ivanov (2012) found that participants who had been forewarned of an attack–i.e. threat–but not given the appropriate tools to combat the attack were more resistant than the control group. In this case, the simple act of forewarning of an attack was enough to resist the counterattitudinal persuasion.\n\nThe second component, refutational preemption, is the cognitive part of the process. It is the ability to activate one's own argument for future defense and strengthen their existing attitudes through counterarguing (Pfau, 1997). Scholars have also explored whether other resistance processes might be at work, including affect. Refutational preemption provides specific content that receivers can employ to strengthen attitudes against subsequent change. This aids in the inoculation process by giving the message receiver a chance to argue with the opposing message. It shows the message receiver that their attitude is not the only attitude or even the right attitude, creating a threat to their beliefs. This is beneficial because the receiver will get practice in defending their original attitude, therefore strengthening it. This is important in fighting off future threats of opposing messages and helps to ensure that the message will not affect their original stance on the issues (Banas & Rains, 2010, p. 285). Refutational preemption acts as the weak strain of the virus in the metaphor. By injecting the weakened virus–the opposing opinion–into a receiver, this prompts the receiver to strengthen their position, enabling them to fight off the opposing threat. By the time the body processes the virus–the counterattack–the receiver will have learned how to eliminate the threat. In the case of messaging, if the threatening message is weak or unconvincing, a person can reject the message and stick with their original stance on the matter. By being able to reject threatening messages a person builds strength of their belief and every successful threatening message that they can encounter their original opinions only get stronger (Banas & Rains, 2010, p. 285). Recent research has studied the presence and function of word-of-mouth communication, or post-inoculation talk (see Compton & Pfau, 2009), following exposure to inoculation messages (e.g., Ivanov et al., 2015).\n\nDelay is the next element that is necessary in the inoculation process. There has been much debate on whether there is a certain amount of time necessary between inoculation and further attacks on a persons' attitude that will be most effective in strengthening that person's attitude. McGuire (1961) suggested that delay was necessary strengthening a person's attitude and since then many scholars have found evidence to back that idea up. There are also scholars on the other side who suggest that too much of a delay lessens the strengthening effect of inoculation. With this being said, it has been revealed that the effect of inoculation can still be significant weeks or even months after initial introduction or the treatment showing that it does produce somewhat long-lasting effects (Banas & Rains, 2010).\n\nInvolvement is the final element of the inoculation process. Pfau, et al. (1997a) defined involvement as \"the importance or salience of an attitude object for a receiver\" and is “among the most important and widely employed concepts in the scholarly literature on persuasion” (p. 190). Involvement is critical; an individual's involvement with an issue determines how effective the inoculation process will be, if at all. If an individual does not have a vested interest in the subject, they will not perceive a threat and, consequently, will not feel the need to defend and strengthen their original opinion, rendering the inoculation process ineffective.\n\nResearch during the past two decades has revealed numerous real-world applications of inoculation theory. The field of Public Relations is the perfect place for the inoculation theory to be used because the field itself is meant to act to the public, their opinions, and their actions. It is especially useful with an audience who already has an opinion on a brand. Inoculation theory is the perfect way to convince already faithful customers that they are making the right choice in trusting your company and to keep the customer coming back in the future. For example, Apple and their \"Get A Mac\" campaign. This campaign did a great job of following the inoculation theory in targeting those who already preferred Mac computers. The series of ads pit out in the duration of the campaign had a similar theme; they directly compared Macs and PCs. Inoculation theory applies here as these commercials are more than likely aimed toward Apple users. These ads are effective because the Apple users already prefer Mac computers and they unlikely to change their minds. This comparison creates refutational preemption, showing Macs may not be the only viable options on the market. The TV ads throw in a few of the positive advantages that PCs have over Macs, but by the end of every commercial they reiterate the fact that the Mac is ultimately the superior product for consumers. This reassures viewers that their opinion is still right and that Macs are in fact better than PCs. The inoculation theory in these ads keep Mac users coming back for Apple products and may even have them coming back sooner for the bigger and better products that Apple is releasing. That last part is especially important in a field like technology because it is continually changing and something new is always being pushed out onto the shelves.\n\nAn example of inoculation theory usage in politics are present in studies indicating that it is possible to inoculate political supporters of a candidate in a campaign against the influence of an opponent's attack ads (Pfau & Burgoon, 1988); citizens against the corrosive influence of soft-money-sponsored political attack ads on democratic values (Pfau, M., Park, D., Holbert, R. L., & Cho, J., 2001); citizens of fledgling democracies against the spiral of silence which can thwart the expression of minority views (Lin, W. K., & Pfau, M., 2007); commercial brands against the influence of competitors' comparative ads (Pfau, 1992a); corporations against the damage to credibility and image that can occur in crisis settings (Dawar, N., & Pillutla, M. M., 2000); and young adolescents against influences of peer pressure, which can lead to smoking, underage drinking, and other harmful behaviors (Godbold, L. C., & Pfau, M., 2000).\n\nWhile there are many studies that have been conducted comparing different treatments of inoculation, there is one specific comparison that is mentioned throughout various studies. This is the comparison between what is known as refutational same and refutational different messages. A refutational same message is an inoculation treatment that refutes specific potential counterarguments that will appear in the subsequent persuasion message, while refutational different treatments are refutations that are not the same as those present in the impending persuasive message (Pfau et al., 1990). Pfau and his colleagues (1990) developed a study during the 1988 United States presidential election. The Republicans were claiming that the Democratic candidate was known to be lenient when it came to the issue of crime. The researchers developed a refutational same message that stated that while the Democratic candidate was in favor of tough sentences, merely tough sentences could not reduce crime. The refutational different message expanded on the candidate's platform and his immediate goals if he were to be elected. The study showed comparable results between the two different treatments. Importantly, as McGuire and others had found previously, inoculation was able to confer resistance to arguments that were not specifically mentioned in the inoculation message.\n\nCompton and Ivanov (2013) offer a comprehensive review of political inoculation scholarship and outline new directions for future work.\n\nSample studies include:\n\nPfau and some of his colleagues examined inoculation through the use of direct mail during the 1988 presidential campaign. The researchers were specifically interested in comparing inoculation and post hoc refutation. Post hoc refutation is another form of building resistance to arguments, however, instead of building resistance prior to future arguments, like inoculation, it attempts to restore original beliefs and attitudes after the counterarguments have been made. Results of the research reinforced prior conclusions that refutational same and different treatments both increase resistance to attacks. More important, results also indicated inoculation was superior to post hoc refutation when attempting to protect original beliefs and attitudes (Pfau et al., 1990).\n\nMuch of the research conducted in health is attempting to create campaigns that will encourage people to stop unhealthy behaviors (e.g. getting people to stop smoking or prevention of teen alcoholism). Compton, Jackson and Dimmock (2016) reviewed studies where inoculation theory was applied to health-related messaging. There are many inoculation studies with the intent to inoculate children and teenagers to prevent them from smoking, doing drugs or drinking alcohol. Much of the research shows that targeting at a young age can help them resist peer pressure in high school or college.\n\nGodbold and Pfau (2000) used sixth graders from two different schools and applied inoculation theory as a defense against peer pressure to drinking alcohol. They hypothesized that a normative message, a message tailored around what the social norms are, would be more effective than an informative message. An informative message is a message tailored around giving individuals information pieces. In this case, the information was why drinking alcohol is bad. The second hypothesis was that subjects who receive a threat two weeks later will be more resistant than those receiving an immediate attack. The results supported the first hypothesis partially. The normative message created higher resistance from the attack, but was not necessarily more effective. The second hypothesis was also not supported; therefore, the time lapse did not create further resistance for teenagers against drinking. One major outcome from this study was the resistance created by utilizing a normative message.\n\nIn another study conducted by Duryea (1983), the results were far more supportive of the theory. The study also attempted to find the message to use for educational training to help prevent teen drinking and driving. The teen subjects were given resources to combat attempts to persuade them to drink and drive or to get into a vehicle with a drunk driver. The subjects were: 1) shown a film; 2) participated in question and answer; 3) role playing exercises; and 4) a slide show. The results showed that a combination of the four methods of training was effective in combating persuasion to drink and drive or get into a vehicle with a drunk driver. The trained group was far more prepared to combat the persuasive arguments.\n\nAdditionally, Parker, Ivanov, and Compton (2012) found that inoculation messages can be an effective deterrent against pressures to engage in unprotected sex and binge drinking—even when only one of these issues is mentioned in the health message.\n\nAnother study by Pfau, et al. (1992) examined the role of inoculation when attempting to prevent adolescents from smoking. One of the main goals of the study was to examine longevity and persistence of inoculation. They took a group of elementary school students in South Dakota and had the students watch a video warning them of future pressures to smoke. In the first year, resistance was highest among those with low self-esteem (Pfau et al., 1992). At the end of the second year, students in the group showed more attitudinal resistance to smoking than they did previously (Pfau & Van Bockern 1994). Importantly, the study and its follow-up demonstrate the long-lasting effects of inoculation treatments.\n\nOther recent areas of study include vaccination safety. Wong and Harrison (2014) studied 212 female students and their attitudes about the HPV vaccine. They found that inoculation messages about HPV helped build resistance to messages that attacked the effectiveness of the HPV vaccine. Additionally, Compton, Jackson and Dimmock (2016) discussed possibilities of further research. One topic was on the preparation of possible health concerns that new parents may not be expecting. For example, benefits of breastfeeding, sleep deprivation and post-partum depression.\n\nOne area that has been heavily researched since the development of the theory is the prevention of smoking. These studies have mainly focused on preventing youth smokers–inoculation seems to be most effective in young children. Grover (2011) researched the effectiveness of the \"truth\" anti-smoking campaign on smokers and non-smokers. Grover divided the two groups to show that inoculation works differently when the behavior is already being exercised versus the behavior being non-existent. In the first hypothesis Grover predicted that exposure to the \"truth\" ads would result in negative attitudes towards smoking after being exposed to pro-smoking advertisements. That hypothesis was supported by the data. In the second hypothesis, exposure to \"truth\" ads results in increased aversion to tobacco industry retail products, the results showed the contrary. Exposure to \"truth\" ads reduces aversion to tobacco branded products. The other observation made here was that the greater the exposure to pro-smoking ads, the higher the aversion to tobacco retail products. This observation contradicts hypothesis H2c and hypothesis H3. In H3, the prediction was that the aversion towards tobacco industry retail products would dictate the exposure to \"truth\" ads and attitudes towards tobacco companies. This data was taken from a combined sample of both smokers and non-smokers. When Grover split the data between the two groups all the original hypotheses were supported, except H2c. Those results mirrored the results of the pooled data. What Grover demonstrated was that the initial attitude plays a major role in the ability to inoculate an individual.\nFuture studies in the area of health can be extremely beneficial to communities. Some areas that are currently being researched can possibly help with present-day issues (e.g., inoculation-based strategies for addiction intervention to assist sober individuals from relapsing). Other areas for future studies include, promoting healthy eating habits, exercising, breastfeeding and creating positive attitude towards mammograms (Ivanov, 2017). An area that has been underdeveloped is mental health awareness. With the number of young adults and teens committing suicide due to bullying this can be an area where inoculation messages could be effective. McGuire (1961) used a medical analogy to initially describe his theory. Unsurprisingly, inoculation strategies can be most effective when combined with health issues.\n\nInoculation theory research, as applied to advertising and marketing, are primarily focused on promoting healthy lifestyles with the help of a product or for a specific company's goal.\n\nShortly after McGuire published his development on inoculation theory, Szybillo and Heslin (1973) applied the concepts that McGuire used in the health industry to advertising and marketing campaigns. They sought to provide answers for advertisers marketing a controversial product or topic: if an advertiser knew the product or campaign would cause an attack, what would be the best advertising strategy? Would they want to refute the arguments or reaffirm their claims? (Szybill and Heslin, 1973)\n\nSzybillo and Heslin (1973) sought to test five hypotheses: 1) to reaffirm or refute the arguments is better than not addressing, 2) refuting the same counterarguments will be more effective than supportive defense, 3) refutational defense is better than supportive defense, 4) over a long period, refutational defense is more effective than supportive defenses, and 5) high credibility sources are more effective than low credibility. The controversial topic in the study was: \"Inflatable air bags should be installed as passive safety devices in all new cars.\"\n\nSzybillo and Heslin (1973) tested four advertisement strategies: defense, refutational-same, refutational-different and supportive. They also manipulated the time of the counterargument attack. Some subjects received the attack message 30 minutes after and the other group three days later. The results confirmed the first hypothesis that a reaffirmation or refutation approach is better than not addressing the attack. The second hypothesis was also confirmed with the data that refuting the counterargument is more effective than supportive defense. The third hypothesis was confirmed as well, though the mean for refutational-different posttreatment was not much greater than for supportive posttreatment. In this study the time lapse was not significantly impactful nor was the credibility of the source. Thus, hypothesis four and five were not supported.\n\nIn 2006, a jury awarded Martin Dunson and Lisa Jones, the parents of one-year-old Marquis Matthew Dunson, $5 million for the death of their son. Dunson and Jones sued Johnson & Johnson, the makers of Infant's Tylenol claiming that there were not enough warnings regarding the dosage of acetaminophen (Daly, 2006).\n\nWhat resulted was a Johnson & Johnson campaign that encouraged parents to practice proper dosage procedures (Veil and Kent, 2008). In a review of the campaign by Veil and Kent (2008), they breakdown the message of the campaign utilizing the basic concepts of inoculation theory. They theorize that Johnson & Johnson used inoculation to alter the negative perception of their product. The campaign began running prior to the actual verdict, thus the timing seemed suspicious.\n\nA primary contention made by Veil and Kent (2008) was that the intentions of Johnson & Johnson were not to convey safety guidelines for consumers, but to change how the consumer might respond to further lawsuits on overdose. The inoculation strategy used by Johnson & Johnson, per Veil and Kent, is evident in their campaign script: \"Some people think if you have a really bad headache, you should take extra medicine.\" The authors state the term \"some people\" is referring to the party suing the company. The commercial also used the Vice President of Sales for Tylenol to deliver a message, who may be considered a credible source.\n\nIn 1995, Burgoon et al. published empirical findings on issue/advocacy advertising campaigns like the one Johnson & Johnson executed. Most, if not all, of these types of advertising campaigns utilize inoculation to create the messages. Burgoon et al. (1995) posited that the use of inoculation strategies for these types of campaigns should be utilized to enhance the corporations' credibility and aide in maintaining the existing consumer attitude. This strategy should not be used to change consumer attitudes. Based on the analysis of previous research Burgoon et al. concluded issue/advocacy advertising is most effective for reinforcing support and avoid potential slippage in the attitudes of supporters. \nBased on previous publications they looked to test three hypotheses. The first was that issue/advocacy advertisements work to inoculate against counterattitudinal attacks. Next, issue/advocacy advertisements work to protect the source credibility. Lastly, conservatives are more likely to be inoculated by issue/advocacy messages. They use Mobil Oil's issue/advocacy campaign to test the hypotheses.\n\nThe first hypothesis was supported by the data. There was a significant effect provided by inoculation. Additionally, H1 showed that issue/advocacy inoculation messages and attack messages vary in effectiveness depending on the content. The result was also noted in the results of H2, which were also supported by the results. Finally, the results indicated that political views play a role in the effectiveness of the campaigns. Thus, confirming H3, that conservatives are easier to inoculate. They also posed a research question regarding the impact of gender on inoculation effectiveness in issue/advocacy campaigns. The conclusion was made that females are more likely to be inoculated with these types of campaigns. An additional observation made by Burgoon et. al (1995) was that the type of content used in these campaigns contributed to the campaigns success. The further the advertisement was from \"direct self-benefit\" the greater the inoculation effect was on the audience (Burgoon, et al., 1995).\n\nIt took quite some time for inoculation theory to be applied to marketing, because of the many limitations (Lessne and Didow, 1987). Lessne and Didow (1987) reviewed publications about inoculation application to marketing campaigns. They note that, at the time, the closest to true marketing context was Hunt's 1973 study on the Chevron campaign.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission made a statement that Chevron had deceived consumers on the effectiveness of their gas additive F-310. The FTC was going to conduct a corrective advertising campaign to disclose the information. In response to that, Chevron ran a print campaign to try and combat the anticipated FTC campaign. The double page advertisement read, \"If every motorist used Chevron with F-310 for 2000 miles, air pollutants would be reduced by thousands of tons in a single day. The Federal Trade Commission doesn't think that's significant.\" Hunt used this real-life message as an inoculation treatment in his research (Lessne and Didow, 1987).\n\nHe used the corrective campaign by the FTC as the attack on the positive attitude toward Chevron. The results indicated that a supportive treatment offered less resistance than a refutational treatment. The other discovery was that when an inoculative treatment is received, but no attack is followed there is a drop in attitude. One of the major limitations in this study was that Hunt did not allow a time elapse between the treatment and the attack. Which is a major element from McGuire's original theory (McGuire, 1961). Since this publication, there has been more research conducted in marketing and advertising as well. The future applications in marketing are far more promising than they were in 1987.\n\nOther more recent studies include:\n\n\nTreglia and Delia (2017) apply inoculation theory to cyber security; people are susceptible to electronic or physical tricks, scams or misrepresentations that may lead to deviating from security procedures and practices, opening the operator, organization or system to exploits, malware, theft of data or disruption of systems and services. Inoculation in this area improves peoples resistance to such attacks, examples and directions for future work are provided.\n\nRecent studies have approached inoculation by incorporating psychological reactance theory (Brehm, 1966, 1972; Brehm & Brehm, 1981) as a means to enhance resistance outcomes through inoculation theory's two key components: threat and refutational preemption.\n\nMiller, et al. (2013) focused their study on emerging adults and their reactance to persuasive appeals. Research has demonstrated that this population is in a transitional stage in life (Voyer et al., 2005) and are more likely to defend their behavioral freedoms if they feel others are attempting to control their behavior (Grandpre et al., 2003; Miller et al., 2006). Populations in transitional stages rely on source credibility as a major proponent of cognitive processing and message acceptance. If the message is explicit and threatens their perceived freedoms, transitional-stage populations will most likely derogate the source and dismiss the message. Two important needs for reactance to a threatened freedom from an emerging adult population is immediacy and vested interest (Crano, 1995). Their study discusses how emerging adults need to believe their behavioral freedoms, for which they have vestedness, are being threatened and that the threat exists in real time with almost immediate consequences. Threats that their perceived freedoms will be eliminated or minimized increases motivation to restore that freedom or possibly engage in the threatened behavior to reinforce their autonomy and control of their attitudes and actions. The study also surmises that threat does not necessarily need anger to motivate counterargumentation and simply attempting to provoke anger through manipulation is limited as a technique of gauging negative cognitions. Miller, et al. (2013) also consider refutational preemption as motivation for producing initial counterarguments and provocation of dissension when contemplating the attack message (Miller et al., 2013). The main focus of this study is to determine how to improve the effectiveness of the inoculation process by evaluating and generating reactance to a threatened freedom by manipulating explicit and implicit language and its intensity. While most inoculation studies focus on avoiding reactance, or at the very least, minimizing the impact of reactance on behaviors, in contrast, Miller, et al. (2013) chose to manipulate reactance by designing messages to enhance resistance and counterarguing output.\n\nThey posit seven hypotheses in this study. H1 aims to discover if reactance-enhanced messages warning of a potential attitudinal threat negative affect and cognitions toward the attack message and its source. H2 considers if reactance-enhanced messages increase more counterarguments for the subject and a decrease in attitude change. H3 ponders if reactance-enhanced messages also result in more source derogation in terms of credibility and an increase in negative affect toward the source. These first three hypotheses consider the appraisal process of reactance. The final four hypotheses regard the impact of language and intensity as potentially more threatening (i.e. generating more resistance to the message because of increased counterattitudinal output and source derogation.\n\nTheir methods involve three phases. Phase 1 assesses the attitudes of their participants regarding four topics: \"legalization of marijuana, gun control legislation, legalization of gambling, and restriction of television violence\" (Miller et al., 2013, p. 135). Phase 2 presented an inoculation message relative to each participant's measured attitudes from Phase 1. The participants were divided into two groups, including the inoculation group and the control group. The questionnaire the participants received also gauged both their perceived threat and affect toward the attack messages. In Phase 3, each group was also given an attack message using either high-controlling or low-controlling language, and again, to evaluate the levels of perceived threat and affect.\n\nThe study concluded that support existed for all hypotheses. The results of their experimentation yielded the understanding that inoculation coupled with reactance-enhanced messages leads to \"stronger resistance effects\" (p. 148). Consistent with the medical analogy of inoculation theory, Miller, et al. (2013) liken reactance-enhanced messages to a \"booster shot,\" increasing the success of the inoculation. Another unique feature of the study is examining low-controlling language versus high-controlling language and its impact on affect and source credibility.\n\nSimilarly, Miller, et al. (2007) utilizes psychological reactance theory (Brehm, 1966, 1972; Brehm & Brehm, 1981) to avoid or eliminate source derogation and message rejection. In this study, their focus is instead Brehm's concept of restoration. Some of their ideas deal with low reactance and whether it can lead to more positive outcomes and if behavioral freedoms can be restored once threatened. As discussed in Miller, et al. (2013), this study ponders whether individuals know they have the behavioral freedom that is being threatened and whether they feel they are worthy of that freedom. This idea also ties into the emerging adult population of the above study and its affirmation that individuals in transitional stages will assert their threatened behavior freedoms (Voyer et al., 2005; Grandpre et al., 2003; Miller et al., 2006; Miller et al. 2007; Miller et al., 2013).\n\nMiller, et al. (2007) sought to determine how effective explicit and implicit language is at mitigating reactance. Particularly, restoration of freedom is a focus of this study, and gauging how concrete and abstract language informs an individual's belief that he or she has a choice. Some participants were given a persuasive appeal related to health promotion with a following postscripted message designed to remind them they have a choice as a method of restoring the participants' freedom. Using concrete language proved more effective at increasing the possibilities of message acceptance and source credibility. This study is relevant to inoculation research in that it lends credence to Miller, et al. (2013), which transparently incorporates psychological reactance theory in conjunction with inoculation theory to improve the quality of persuasive appeals in the future.\n\nFollowing Compton and Pfau's (2009) research on postinoculation talk, Ivanov, et al. (2012) explore how cognitive processing could lead to talk with others after receiving an inoculation message in which threat exists. The authors found that message processing leads to postinoculation talk which could potentially lead to stronger resistance to attack messages. Further, postinoculation talk acts virally, spreading inoculation through talk with others on issues that involve negative cognitions and affect. In previous research, the assumption that talk was subvocal (existing only intrapersonally) was prevalent, without concern for the impact of vocal talk with other individuals. Ivanov, et al. (2012) deems vocal talk important to the incubation process.\n\nTheir study concluded that individuals who receive an inoculation message that contains threat will talk to others about the message and talk more frequently than individuals who do not receive an inoculation message. Additionally, the act of postinoculation talk bolsters their attitudes and increases resistance to the message as well as increasing the likelihood that talk will generate a potentially viral effect–spreading inoculation to others through the act of vocal talk (Ivanov et al., 2012).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "39434976", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39434976", "title": "Inquisitor (video game)", "text": "Inquisitor (video game)\n\nInquisitor is a role-playing video game developed by Czech company Cinemax. The game was originally released in 2009, and was in development for almost 10 years. Three more years were needed to translate the game into English and it was released on GOG.com on September 5, 2012. On June 1, 2013, \"Inquisitor\" was greenlit on Steam.\n\nInquisitor plays similarly to \"Baldur's Gate\" series, being a top-down role-playing game. Firstly, the player chooses his character from the classes of priest, paladin or thief. The player then travels throughout the world, fighting against monsters along the way. The player also investigates crimes against God and the king by finding evidence against the suspect, after which they may be arrested, tortured, and, after conviction, burned at the stake. It is, however, possible to mistakenly arrest innocents should false evidence be found.\n\nEvidence in \"Inquisitor\" includes the testimony of other characters in the game, as well as items found at location where the crime was committed. It is also possible to draw conclusions from seemingly unrelated information. Found evidence is recorded in character's notebook.\n\nThe game has an estimated playing time of 100 hours. Inquisitor includes more than 200 weapons, 80 spells and 7 types of magic, alongside over 90 types of monster to combat.\n\nThe setting of Inquisitor is the fictional kingdom of Utherst, in which the omens of the Prophecy of Saint Ezekiel have started to appear, foretelling the end of the world. The game chronicles the efforts of the titular Inquisition to fight against heresy in light of this. The main character Maxmilian Conti is an Inquisitor who is sent to the town of Hillbrandt to investigate the murder of a local merchant.\n\nMaxmilian finds out that the merchant was murdered by Linda von Callagan a wife of a local noble. At first she refuses her guilt but later she confesses due to fear of murder by bishop Vallarian a highest ranking Inquisitor in area. It is revealed that Vallarian is a plotted all problems in Hillbrandt to retrieve an artifact found by the murdered merchant. He used the artifact to summon a demon Arthamon. Vallarian is executed but there are clues indicating that he was a member of an ancient cult trying to bring an apocalypse.\n\nMaxmilian leaves Hillbrandt and continues his investigation in Glatzburg. There he seeks a help of a local priest Trevorius. When he gains his trust Trevorius is murdered. In the end the protagonist tracks down another member of the cult who is no less than Cardinal Truncquillius. Truncquillius is also arrested an executed but not before he summons a demon Bafomet to the world.\n\nMaxmilian then goes to Alvaron, the capital of the kingdom. He gets there just a short time after death of the king. His investigation leads to his fight to all summoned demons and finding the actual leader of the cult - archbishop Lauentius. When he finds him, player can choose if he wants to join the cult or to stop it.\n\nIf he joins the cult, Laurentius is killed by a knight who shows up and attacks the player. When the knight is killed player has to defeat Archangel Gabriel. Player then revives the crown prince Louis who has to create a new world order.\n\nIf player decides to stop the cult he kills Laurentius but has to fight a fallen angel Azrael. When he defeats Azrael, the crown prince Louis is revived and becomes the new king. In outro it is revealed that pope sent a crusade against the kingdom and Louis has to lead his armies to defend the kingdom. Conti's fate is left unknown.\n\n\"Inquisitor\" was in development since 1999 when a company \"Wooden Dragon\" was founded. The project was financially supported by Cinemax. The game is inspired by Umberto Eco's works such as The Name of the Rose. The original release date was scheduled for 2001. In 2001 the game was delayed to 2002. The new release date wasn't scheduled.\n\nIn the end the development took 10 years and the game was finally released in November 2009. Developers started to focus on fixing bugs and translation to English. In 2012 the English version was released on GOG and in 2013 on Steam.\n\nThe game received average to positive reviews. It was praised for its story, atmosphere and scope, but was criticized for the quality of its graphics and its high difficulty.\n\n\nWhen Steam started its concepts feature in October 2012, Cinemax made a concept for \"Inquisitor 2\". They asked players what would they expect from next project, giving the choice of a classic role-playing like \"Inquisitor\", an adventure game with role-playing elements, or a different type of a role-playing game than \"Inquisitor\".\n\nThe developers also released \"Inquisitor: Renesance zla\" (\"Inquisitor: The Renaissance of Evil\"), a novel that serves as a sequel to the game. It is set 200 years after Inquisitor game and follows Maxmilian Conti, the protagonist of the game, who is summoned from hell.\n\n"}

The creature makes radio contact with a disillusioned human scientist, who agrees to help because the scientist believes such an alien intervention will bring peace and save a doomed humanity from itself.\nDr. Tom Anderson (Van Cleef), an embittered scientist, has made contact with a Venusian creature, while using his radio transmitter. The alien's secret motivation is to take complete control of the Earth by enslaving humanity using mind control devices; the alien claims it only wants to bring peace to our troubled world by eliminating all emotions. Anderson agrees to help the creature and even intends to allow it to assimilate his wife (Garland) and friend Dr. Nelson (Graves).\n\nThe Venusian then disrupts all electric power on Earth, including motor vehicles, leaving Dr. Nelson to resort to riding a bicycle.\n\nAfter avoiding a flying bat-like creature which carries the mind control device, Dr. Nelson returns home to find his wife newly assimilated. She then attempts to force his own assimilation using another bat-creature in her possession, and he ends up being forced to kill her in self-defense. By then, the only people who are still free from the Venusian's influence are Nelson, Anderson, Anderson's wife and a group of army soldiers on station in the nearby woods.\n\nNelson finally persuades the paranoid Anderson that he has made a horrible mistake in blindly trusting the Venusian's motives, allying himself with a creature bent on world domination. When they discover Tom's wife has taken a rifle to the alien's cave in order to kill it, they hurriedly follow her, but the creature kills Claire Anderson before the two doctors can rescue her. Finally, seeing the loss of everything he holds dear, Dr. Anderson viciously attacks the Venusian by holding a blowtorch to the creature's face; Anderson dies at the alien's hand as it expires.\n\n\"It Conquered the World\" was written by Lou Rusoff, but before being completed, Rusoff's brother died and he had to leave for Canada. Corman then called in Charles Griffith to do a final rewrite, two days before filming began; Griffith, however, didn't want his name to be credited on screen. Griffith does have a small part as a scientist.\n\nThe design of the creature was Corman's idea, and he thought that coming from a big planet, \"It\" would have evolved to deal with heavy gravity and would therefore be low to the ground. Corman later admitted this was a mistake, saying the creature would have been more frightening had \"It\" been larger or taller. When Beverly Garland first saw the creature, she commented \"\"That\" conquered the world?\" and kicked \"It\" over. Based on this action, the design of the creature was reworked.\n\nThe creature's working pincers were broken on the first day of shooting, but its arms could still be raised. The melting eye effect was completed using chocolate syrup.\n\nGriffith on the creature prop:\n\nI called it Denny Dimwit and somebody else called it an ice-cream cone. I was around when Paul Blaisdell was building it, and he thought the camera would make it look bigger. I have some photographs of it in construction, probably the only ones in existence. I asked for my name not to be on that picture, so I was unbilled. Surprisingly, it got good reviews.\n\n\"It Conquered the World\" was released theatrically by AIP in July 1956 on a double bill with \"The She-Creature\".\n\nThe film originally received an \"X\" certificate in the UK, meaning the picture could only be seen by adults. At issue, the scene of the creature being destroyed by a blowtorch was seen as animal cruelty. However, producer Samuel Z. Arkoff convinced the film board that the violence was against a otherworldly person, and not an animal, earning the film its passing certificate.\n\nDuring the 1960s, \"It Conquered the World\" was syndicated to television by American International Television. VHS versions appeared in the 1990s on the US home video market (RCA Columbia Home Video), but these are no longer in distribution, nor is the film available on DVD or Blu-ray in the US or in the UK.\n\nFilm historian and critic Leonard Maltin called \"It Conquered the World\" \"... well acted and interesting but awkwardly plotted\". \"Variety\" found the movie a cut above normal, despite its low budget, and praised the \"remarkable adult questions\" asked by the screenplay.\n\n\"Time Out\" magazine, however, gave the film a negative review, criticizing its poor special effects. Critic Tony Rayns opined, \"You have to see a movie like this to realise that film-makers who feel they have nothing to lose are rarer than you'd think\".\n\nThe \"Chicago Reader\" gave the film a generally positive review, saying, \"Amazingly, this 1953 [sic] picture isn't half bad\". \"Allmovie\" gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, calling it an \"above-average quickie\".\nIn 2001, Susan Nicholas Hofheinz, the widow of AIP co-founder James H. Nicholson, sued A&E Networks for copyright infringement after the channel used footage of the film in a documentary about Peter Graves.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "23759838", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23759838", "title": "Kirchner Cultural Centre", "text": "Kirchner Cultural Centre\n\nThe Kirchner Cultural Centre () is a cultural centre located in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It is the largest of Latin America, and the third or fourth largest in the world.\n\nIt was opened on May 21, 2015, and is located in the former Buenos Aires Central Post Office (\"Palacio de Correos\"). The cultural centre was named after former president of Argentina Néstor Kirchner.\n\nThe 9 floor centre has a concert hall; 5 other auditoriums for theater and concerts; 18 halls for poetry readings, performance art, and other events; 40 rooms of art and history galleries totaling 15,000 square meters on 6 floors; 16 rehearsal rooms; and 2 rooftop terraces.\n\nThe need for a new central post office in Buenos Aires was first raised in 1888 by the director of the Correo Argentino (Argentine Postal Service) at the time, Dr. Ramón J. Cárcano. Later that year a Congressional bill providing for its construction was signed by President Miguel Juárez Celman. The Ministry of Public Works commissioned French architect Norbert Maillart for its design in 1889.\nDesignating a 12,500 m² (134,000 ft²) city block on the corner of Leandro Alem and Corrientes Avenues for its construction, the Public Works Ministry chose the site as a means to beautify a land reclamation site where the shores of the Río de la Plata had reached just a decade earlier. The sudden onset of the Panic of 1890 and the subsequent crisis led to President Juárez Celman's resignation, however, as well as to the project's suspension.\nThe national government revived the plans only in 1905, and in 1908 Maillart returned to Buenos Aires, where his new plans for a larger post office were approved the following April. Differences later arose between Maillart and the Argentine government, and the French architect abandoned the project in 1911. Construction, which had just started, was then left to the supervision of Maillart's chief assistant, Jacques Spolsky. Spolsky reengineered the design, which featured masonry supports, to consist of a steel-reinforced concrete structure, for which 2,882 steel pillars were placed onto the bedrock, 10 m (33 ft) deep.\n\nLimitations on the city's public works budgets resulting from the onset of World War I forced another major design alteration in 1916. The planned construction of an elevated causeway on Leandro Alem Avenue was cancelled, and a mezzanine was quickly added to the plans to compensate for an entrance which would now be one floor below the original's. Spolsky achieved this without substantial changes to the building's exterior, though the number of delays led to considerable cost overruns on the project, and its budget was exhausted in 1923. President Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear, however, obtained Congressional support for a new appropriation, and on September 28, 1928 (two weeks before the end of Alvear's tenure), the new \"Secretaría de Comunicaciones\" was inaugurated.\n\nThe building's eclectic design, drawing prominently from French Second Empire architecture, was typical of the public buildings and upscale real estate built in Buenos Aires and other Argentine cities early in the 20th Century. Despite their differences, Maillart went on to design the Buenos Aires National College and the Argentine Supreme Court, and Spolsky designed post offices for Rosario and San Miguel de Tucumán in a similar style while at work on this structure.\n\nThe largest public building completed in Argentina up to that point, the building measured eight stories and 60 m (200 ft) in height and included over 88,000 m² (948,000 ft²) of indoor space. The central hall was decorated with marble throughout, features stained glass windows, numerous bronze sculptures and mail drop boxes, and a 4-story-high domed ceiling.\n\nThe grandiose setting led President Juan Perón to move his offices in the building during the early years of his 1946-55 tenure, and the First Lady, Eva Perón, designated a wing as the first headquarters of the charitable Eva Perón Foundation.\n\nDuring the subsequent automobile boom in Argentina, the plaza facing the post office was made into a parking lot. Opposition to the 1979 sale of the parking lot for the construction of a local Bank of Tokyo headquarters proved insurmountable, and the plans were cancelled. Guillermo del Cioppo, the Minister of Urban Development and later Mayor, ordered the construction of an underground parking structure instead, and the lot above was converted into a park in 1983.\n\nThe building was designated a National Historic Monument in 1997. Most of its postal activities had been transferred to a newer structure during the Perón administration, and it handled only international mail in later years. In 2005, its last remaining postal bureau was closed.\n\nPresident Néstor Kirchner proposed the conversion of the abandoned building and landmark into a cultural centre in June 2005, and two years later, plans were approved for the construction of two concert halls and an exhibition gallery for the creation of the Bicentennial Cultural Centre (\"Centro Cultural del Bicentenario\"). The centre's winning design was provided by a team of architects led by siblings Enrique, Federico and Nicolás Bares.\n\nIt was originally scheduled to be inaugurated on the Argentina Bicentennial, May 25, 2010. Completion of the new centre was delayed considerably, however, and in 2012 its designated name was amended as \"Centro Cultural del Bicentenario Presidente Dr. Néstor Carlos Kirchner\", in honor of the late former president. Upon opening in May 2015 it was named the shorter \"Centro Cultural Kirchner\" (English: Kirchner Cultural Centre).\n\nWhen the architects added new spaces and elements, they purposely used different materials such as clear and frosted glass and stainless steel, to maintain sight of the ornate Beaux-Arts style beauty of the original building. The main concert hall \"La Sala Sinfonica\", (originally named \"La Ballena Azul\", or \"The Blue Whale\") seating 1,950 people, is a blimp-shaped three-storey auditorium and opera house floating in the former package-sorting area. It houses a Klais Orgelbau pipe organ (opus 1912), this organ can played via a remote console, it has 4 manuals and about eight-thousand pipes, it weights 30 metric tons and features three 32' stops in pédale registers. The other principal venues are the \"Sala Federal\" for music, and \"La Cúpula\" and \"Sala Argentina\" for live theater.\n\nSince the inauguration of President Mauricio Macri (whose father, Francisco Macri, led a conglomerate that once owned the building), the Centre became part of the newly formed Federal System of Media and Public Contents (\"Sistema Federal de Medios y Contenidos Publicos\") and has sought to de-emphasize its function as a homage to Néstor Kirchner. The Centre is now branded simply as \"CCK\" and the room that once housed a memorial display in honour of Kirchner has been dismantled. The Macri administration has intended to change the name of CCK to the \"Bicentennial Cultural Centre\" (\"Centro Cultural del Bicentenario\"). In October 2016, a bill was introduced in Congress to prohibit the federal government from naming facilities after a president who has not been dead for at least 20 years, effectively forcing CCK to be renamed upon passage and enactment of the bill.\n\nThe Argentine National Symphony Orchestra, founded by Péron in 1948 but homeless for 67 years, has taken up permanent residency at the Kirchner Centre.\n\nAs many as 10,000 patrons a day visit venues and events at the Kirchner Centre. Everything is currently free, because the Culture Ministry operates on the assumption that the arts belong to everyone — \"We consider culture to be a right\" — as said by former minister of culture Teresa Parodi in her interview with the U.S. National Public Radio.\n\nPresident Mauricio Macri of Argentina assumed the one-year G20 presidency on 30 November 2017, during an official ceremony in Kirchner Cultural Centre, for the first time in South America.\n\n\n"}

It is a remixed version of the BadBadNotGood (BBNG) song \"Lavender\" with lyrics added which addressed the issue of police brutality in the United States. It was released with a music video which caused some controversy because of a scene depicting a mock assassination of U.S. President Donald Trump. The song was included in Snoop's 2017 album \"Neva Left\".\n\nDuring a video game event in October 2016, the American rapper Snoop Dogg and American YouTuber Jesse Wellens paused for a smoking session. During this time, Wellens proposed a music video with clowns, inspired by the shooting of Philando Castile. Three days later, Snoop sent Wellens his own version of \"Lavender\" with lyrics referencing police brutality. Wellens later told \"Billboard\", \"When I originally wrote the idea of the video, the video of [Philando Castile] getting shot came out online and it was causing riots. We just kind of wanted to bring the clowns out, because it's clownery.\"\n\nIn late October 2016, Snoop previewed his new song regarding police brutality on Instagram, sampling the beat of BBNG's \"Lavender\". Snoop said the song was meant to be \"not controversial but real – real to the voice of the people who don't have a voice.\"\n\nThe song was released on March 12, 2017 with a music video directed by Jesse Wellens and James DeFina. It depicts a world of clowns and \"doggs\". The beginning of the video shows a clown family and follows the father (played by Michael Rapaport), who smokes weed while stressed. After the father encounters a clown policeman, he is shot dead with a glitter gun while a bystander films the incident. The video cuts to \"The Clown House\", where Ronald Klump, a clown parody version of Donald Trump, holds a press conference calling for the deportation of all \"doggs\". In the video, Snoop Dogg sees Klump and his henchmen outside, and he grabs a gun and goes outside to aim it at Klump. When Snoop pulls the trigger, a flag with the word \"bang\" pops out, and Klump is later seen in chains.\n\nThe song was included in Snoop's album \"Neva Left\", released on May 19, 2017.\n\nConservative politicians and commentators criticized the video's mock assassination of Ronald Klump, a parody of Donald Trump. Senator Marco Rubio (R-Florida) said, \"We've had presidents assassinated before in this country, so anything like that, people should really be careful about that kind of thing.\" Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said \"I think it really is in poor taste to be making fun of murdering someone. Particularly assassinating the president.\" On March 15, 2017, President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter, \"Can you imagine what the outcry would be if @SnoopDogg, failing career and all, had aimed and fired the gun at President Obama? Jail time!\" Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen called the video \"totally disgraceful\" and called for Snoop to apologize. The U.S. Secret Service told \"The Wrap\" that the agency was \"aware of\" the video. Jesse Wellens later on the H3 Podcast that the Secret Service interviewed him and Snoop Dogg about the video.\n\nOn March 16, Snoop posted a video responding to the controversy, saying, \"Now they wanna ask me questions and interview me, but guess what? I've got nothing to say, mate.\" Some artists, including T.I. and Talib Kweli, defended Snoop's video. Common compared it to political statements made by Public Enemy and KRS-One. Bow Wow tweeted, \"Ayo @realDonaldTrump shut your punk ass up talking shit about my uncle @SnoopDogg before we pimp your wife and make her work for us,\" and deleted the tweet within 24 hours. While discussing his reaction to the video's ending, Ice-T said, \"I was nervous. He's messing with the line. We'll see how this weighs out, but I roll with Snoop. I thought it was a good video.\"\n\nThe rapper Treach called the video \"artistic\" and compared its comedy to \"Saturday Night Live\" skits. Spencer Kornhaber compared the reactions to the video to remarks made by Madonna at the Women's March on Washington about bombing the White House, arguing that they both show how strong political statements are used by one's political enemies to \"portray Trump's critics as wackos.\" Amy Zimmerman of \"The Daily Beast\" wrote that the music video was \"noticeably bereft of punchlines\" and criticized its depiction of Trump, writing it \"isn't amusing...so much as disturbing and deadly.\" Matthew Dessem, writing for \"Slate\", called the video's execution \"not bad\" and said the video's clown gags gave it \"a lurid effect that actually feels about right for this moment in time.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1828083", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1828083", "title": "Linguistic turn", "text": "Linguistic turn\n\nThe linguistic turn was a major development in Western philosophy during the early 20th century, the most important characteristic of which is the focusing of philosophy and the other humanities primarily on the relationship between philosophy and language.\n\nVery different intellectual movements were associated with the \"linguistic turn\", although the term itself is commonly thought popularised by Richard Rorty's 1967 anthology \"The Linguistic Turn\", in which it means the turn towards linguistic philosophy. According to Rorty, who later dissociated himself from linguistic philosophy and analytic philosophy generally, the phrase \"the linguistic turn\" originated with philosopher Gustav Bergmann.\n\nTraditionally, the linguistic turn is taken to also mean the birth of analytic philosophy. One of the results of the linguistic turn was an increasing focus on logic and philosophy of language, and the cleavage between ideal language philosophy and ordinary language philosophy.\n\nAccording to Michael Dummett, the linguistic turn can be dated to Gottlob Frege's 1884 work \"The Foundations of Arithmetic\", specifically paragraph 62 where Frege explores the identity of a numerical proposition. \n\nIn order to answer a Kantian question about numbers, \"How are numbers given to us, granted that we have no idea or intuition of them?\" Frege invokes his \"context principle\", stated at the beginning of the book, that only in the context of a proposition do words have meaning, and thus finds the solution to be in defining \"the sense of a proposition in which a number word occurs.\" Thus an ontological and epistemological problem, traditionally solved along idealist lines, is instead solved along linguistic ones.\n\nThis concern for the logic of propositions and their relationship to \"facts\" was later taken up by the notable analytic philosopher Bertrand Russell in \"On Denoting\", and played a weighty role in his early work in logical atomism.\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein, an associate of Russell, was one of the progenitors of the linguistic turn. This follows from his ideas in his \"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\" that philosophical problems arise from a misunderstanding of the logic of language, and from his remarks on language games in his later work. His later work (specifically \"Philosophical Investigations\") significantly departs from the common tenets of analytic philosophy and might be viewed as having some resonance in the post-structuralist tradition. \n\nW. V. O. Quine describes the historical continuity of the linguistic turn with earlier philosophy in \"Two Dogmas of Empiricism\": \"Meaning is what essence becomes when it is divorced from the object of reference and wedded to the word.\"\n\nLater in the twentieth century, philosophers like Saul Kripke in \"Naming and Necessity\" drew metaphysical conclusions from closely analyzing language.\n\nDecisive for the linguistic turn in the humanities were the works of yet another tradition, namely the Continental structuralism of Ferdinand de Saussure. Structuralism was the initial outcome of Saussure's linguistic turn, which later led to poststructuralism with the input of Friedrich Nietzsche's ideas. Influential poststructuralist theorists include Judith Butler, Luce Irigaray, Julia Kristeva, Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida. The power of language, more specifically of certain rhetorical tropes, in historical discourse was explored by Hayden White.\n\nThese various movements often lead to the notion that language 'constitutes' reality, a position contrary to intuition and to most of the Western tradition of philosophy. The traditional view (what Derrida called the 'metaphysical' core of Western thought) saw words as functioning labels attached to concepts. According to this view, there is something like 'the \"real\" chair', which exists in some external reality and corresponds roughly with a concept in human thought, \"chair\", to which the linguistic word \"chair\" refers. However, the founder of structuralism, Ferdinand de Saussure, held that definitions of concepts cannot exist independently from a linguistic system defined by difference, or, to put it differently, that a concept of something cannot exist without being named. Thus differences between meanings structure our perception; there is no \"real\" chair except insofar as we are manipulating symbolic systems. We would not even be able to recognize a chair \"as\" a chair without simultaneously recognising that a chair is \"not\" everything else - in other words a chair is defined as being a specific collection of characteristics which are themselves defined in certain ways, and so on, and all of this within the symbolic system of language. Thus, a large part of what we think of as \"reality\" is really a convention of naming and characterising, a convention which is itself called \"language\".\n\n\n\n"}

Based on the comic strip \"Little Nemo in Slumberland\" by Winsor McCay, the film went through a lengthy development process with a number of screenwriters. Ultimately, the screenplay was credited to Chris Columbus and Richard Outten; the storyline and art style differed from the original version. The original soundtrack was penned by the Academy Award-winning Sherman Brothers.\n\nA box office bomb in its original Japanese release, the film suffered additional commercial failure when released in the United States, where 11 minutes of material was removed in order to secure a family-friendly G rating from the Motion Picture Association of America.\n\nThe film opens with the young boy Nemo experiencing a nightmare in which he is pursued by a locomotive. Upon awakening the next day, he goes with his pet flying squirrel, Icarus to see a parade welcoming a traveling circus. However, Nemo is unable to see the circus because his parents are too busy to take him. Later that night, Nemo imitates sleepwalking in a failed attempt to sneak some pie, going against a promise he had earlier made to his mother. Upon falling asleep that night, Nemo is approached by figures from the parade. The circus organist introduces himself as Professor Genius and claims that they had been sent on a mission by King Morpheus, the king of a realm named Slumberland. The mission involves Nemo becoming the playmate of the princess, Camille. Although Nemo initially has reservations about interacting with royalty of the opposite gender, he and Icarus decide to set off to fulfill his mission after being persuaded with a gift box of cookies from the princess.\n\nNemo is taken to Slumberland in a dirigible which he is allowed to drive, causing some chaos and is introduced to King Morpheus, who doubles as the circus ringmaster on Earth. Morpheus reveals that he summoned Nemo to become his heir to the throne. Morpheus gives Nemo a golden key that opens every door in the kingdom, and warns him of a door with a dragon insignia that must never be opened. Nemo is introduced to Princess Camille and the pair and Icarus roam the entirety of Slumberland together. Afterward, Nemo is whisked away by Genius to prince lessons. Later, he meets the mischievous clown, Flip, who angers a group of cops and forces him and Nemo to hide out in a cave. There, Nemo discovers the door that Morpheus warned him not to open. Flip tempts Nemo into unlocking the door, which unleashes the dreaded Nightmare King. Nemo rushes back to Morpheus' castle in time for his coronation ceremony, where Nemo is handed the royal scepter, the only thing capable of defeating the Nightmare King should he ever return to Slumberland. In the middle of a dance session between Morpheus and Genius, the Nightmare King reaches the castle and steals Morpheus away. As the partygoers search for a scapegoat, Flip and Nemo reveal each other responsible for the Nightmare King's escape, since Morpheus gave Nemo the key and it was Flip's idea to open the door.\n\nNemo then awakens in his home, which floods with seawater and ejects him and Icarus into the ocean. Genius reunites with them and tells Nemo not to blame himself and that Flip is to blame for all that has happened; Nemo refutes this, citing that he's the one who made and then broke his promise to Morpheus to never open the door, and resolves to find and rescue the king. When the three return to Slumberland and narrowly prevent Flip's banishment, Nemo forces Flip to reveal that he has a map to Nightmare Land, where Morpheus is currently being held. Nemo, Icarus, Camille, Flip, and Genius set off in a tugboat in search of Morpheus. They are soon sucked into a whirlpool and find themselves in the monster-infested Nightmare Land. The five come across a group of shapeshifting goblins who wish to aid in the quest to rescue Morpheus. \n\nThe Nightmare King sends a flock of fearsome and gigantic goblin bats to seize the rescue party. Nemo attempts to use the scepter, but is unable to remember the full incantation and awakens in his bed along with Icarus just after watching Flip, Genius, and Camille be captured by the Nightmare King's forces. The goblins appear in Nemo's room and reunite with a lost member of theirs, who gives Nemo a letter from Morpheus containing the scepter's incantation to defeat the Nightmare King. The group returns to Nightmare Land by flying on Nemo's bed through a dimensional portal in the sky, and soon reach and infiltrate Nightmare Castle. However, they are subsequently trapped in the castle, where the Nightmare King demands possession of the scepter and threatens Flip, Genius, Camille, and Morpheus, whom are all in suspended animated states, with harm if Nemo doesn't comply. After a fierce battle, Nemo uses the scepter to finally defeat and destroy the Nightmare King and purify his kingdom, though due to Nemo's young age, the use of the scepter inadvertently kills him as well. As everyone awakens in the aftermath and discovers Nemo's lifeless body, they begin to mourn for Slumberland's fallen prince. Morpheus, however, uses the scepter to restore Nemo to life. Nemo apologizes for breaking his promise, opening the door, and causing everything to begin with, but Morpheus forgives him, citing that his courage and strong will have allowed him to make up for his mistake, and become a true prince.\n\nAs Slumberland celebrates the fall of the Nightmare Kingdom, Camille escorts Nemo and Icarus home on the dirigible. The two share a kiss after which Nemo awakens in his room, where he apologizes to his mother for breaking his promise and trying to take the pie. Nemo's parents also agree to take Nemo to the circus. Nemo stares out the window with Icarus as he reflects on his adventure.\n\n\n\"Nemo\" was the brainchild of producer Yutaka Fujioka. His dream for years had been to make a feature length, animated film version of \"Little Nemo in Slumberland\" which would utilize the resources of his Tokyo Movie Shinsha studio. As the first step towards realizing this project, in 1977 he personally flew to Monterey, California to convince McCay's descendents to allow him to obtain the film rights to the comic strip. He originally approached George Lucas a year later to help produce the film, but Lucas found problems with the storyline, feeling there was no character development for the titular character Nemo. Fujioka also approached Chuck Jones, but Jones also declined. The film was officially announced as a project in 1982. In February of that year, the company TMS/Kinetographics was formed in America to produce \"Nemo\", and the best staff from around the world were gathered together to begin production. Gary Kurtz was appointed producer of the American production side and hired Ray Bradbury and later Edward Summer to write screenplays. Kurtz would eventually step down in the fall of 1984.\n\nIn the early 1980s, both Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata were involved with the film, but they both parted ways because of creative differences; essentially, Miyazaki did not seem to be keen on the concept of an animated feature created by him where everything was a dream, and Takahata agreed with Lucas and was more interested in creating a story depicting Nemo's growth as a boy. Miyazaki later described his involvement on the film as \"the worst experience he has ever been through\". The directors who succeeded the duo were Andy Gaskill and Yoshifumi Kondo, whom both exited production in March 1985 after completing a 70mm pilot film. Osamu Dezaki was also brought into direct at a brief point and too completed a pilot film, but left as well. A third pilot film was made by Sadao Tsukioka but has yet to become publicly available.\n\nBrad Bird and Jerry Rees also worked on the film through the American department as animators for a month, while at the time were also working on an unproduced adaptation of Will Eisner's \"The Spirit\" with Gary Kurtz. During production, the two would regularly ask animators what they were doing, the response they were commonly given was \"we're just illustrating what Bradbury is writing\", upon meeting Bradbury in person and asking him about the story he was writing for the film, he replied \"I'm just putting in writing what these wonderful artists are drawing\". Bird and Rees soon left the project after their meeting with Bradbury.\n\nWhen all of these people had left, Fujioka had drafts done by Chris Columbus, Mœbius, John Canemaker, and many others. He then re-hired Summer to do yet another screenplay. Subsequently, Richard Outten was hired to work from Columbus' screenplay while Columbus was busy with his directorial debut, \"Adventures in Babysitting\". Many Disney Studio animators including Ken Anderson and Leo Salkin worked on individual sequences, and John Canemaker, Corny Cole, and Brian Froud provided visual development. Frank Thomas, Oliver Johnston and Paul Julian consulted to the production. The world-famous Sherman Brothers (Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman) were hired to write the songs for \"Nemo\". This was their first anime film, though not their first animated film; the pair had previously worked on several projects for Disney, including \"The Jungle Book\" and Hanna-Barbera's \"Charlotte's Web\".\n\nLittle production progress was made until January 1988, when the many ideas pasted on the walls of the Los Angeles studio were whittled down in order to create the storyboard from which the film would be made. It was at this point, Thomas and Johnston recommended William T. Hurtz as the director of the American production side and TMS hired Masami Hata, a former Sanrio film director, as the appointed director at the TMS studio in Japan. Actual animation for the completed film was commenced in June 1988, as TMS was just completing \"Akira\". The success of that film in Japan further helped TMS finally start production on \"Little Nemo\". Even though it derived from an American comic strip, \"Little Nemo\" was animated by the Japanese company Tokyo Movie Shinsha and thus is often considered an anime film, even though it was a joint production of Japanese and American animators and production companies.\n\nThe Japanese cut was released in Japan on July 15, 1989. In a Summer that included strong competition, including Studio Ghibli's \"Kiki's Delivery Service\", which was ironically directed by one of the animators who left the production of this film, it grossed ¥0.9 billion ($10 million USD) in its release and was considered a box-office flop, against a budget of around ¥3 billion ($35 million USD).\n\nThe English dub was released three years later in the United States in 579 theaters on August 21, 1992 through Hemdale Film Corporation. 11 minutes were cut in order to secure a G rating. This version's opening credits were shortened, as a result, the opening song plays during the opening scene.\n\nIt received mixed to positive reviews from publications including \"The Washington Post\", \"Variety\", the \"New York Post\", the \"Boston Globe\", and \"The New York Times\". Roger Ebert gave the film 2 out of 4 stars, though on a positive note, he wrote: \"Little Nemo is an interesting if not a great film, with some jolly characters, some cheerful songs, and some visual surprises.\"\n\nDespite having a positive reception, the film failed to find an audience. In its opening weekend in the United States, \"Nemo\" made about $407,695 with a total US gross of approximately $1,368,000. It won the \"Audience Award\" at Amsterdam's 1992 Cinekid Festival and was nominated for \"Best Animated Feature\" at the 1993 Annie Awards.\n\nIn March 2005, \"Little Nemo\" was given a very limited re-release in Denver, Seattle, Atlanta, Austin, Houston, and other cities in the US. This was through Regal Entertainment Group's Regal Cinemas, Edwards Theatres, and United Artists Theatres as part of a Kidtoon Films family matinées promotion. It was only shown on weekends.\n\nAfter the film's release, Fujioka decided to retire from the animation business. TMS, having to recoup \"Little Nemo\"s losses, increased production on locally based anime programs and became highly involved in animation for western-based productions, including \"Tiny Toon Adventures\", \"Animaniacs\", and \"\". Since the early 2000s, TMS has no longer supplied animation services to western studios due to increasingly demanding costs. The studio has never again attempted a project like \"Akira\" or \"Nemo\". The studio still does features, but primarily films spinning off existing anime properties, which include the likes of \"Anpanman\" and \"Detective Conan\".\n\nThe film was released on VHS through Hemdale Home Video, Inc. on March 2, 1993. It features a mail-in coupon worth $5.00, with purchases of Tropicana Orange Juice, along with an advert before the film produced by Pixar. Hemdale also produced a Collector's Set which includes a VHS movie, illustrated storybook, and cassette soundtrack. \"Nemo\" became the #4 best-selling children's title of 1993, with 1.5 million copies sold.\n\nOn October 5, 2004, \"Little Nemo\" was released on DVD through Funimation (under the Our Time Family Entertainment name, and under license from TMS, which had regained North American rights to the film after Hemdale closed). All of the cuts that were made in the 1992 release were restored in this DVD, bringing the run time of the film to the full 95 minutes, even though it would receive a PG rating. However, this is not mentioned or addressed in the DVD materials.\n\nAfter the title went out of print, \"Little Nemo\" could be seen selling anywhere from $80 to $200 US for a sealed copy (usually DVD) on Internet sites such as Amazon and eBay. Funimation's DVD was re-released as a budget title from Echo Bridge Home Entertainment on January 27, 2009, appearing commonly in department stores in low-price bargain bins. Then after Echo Bridge's reissue went out of print, it was released again by Discotek Media. On November 6, 2012, Discotek released a Blu-ray of the film containing the Japanese dub and original English audio tracks and included bonus features such as the pilot films from 1984 and 1987.\n\nAfter the Japanese release, but before the US release, Capcom developed an NES game titled \"Little Nemo: The Dream Master\", which was released in late 1990. An arcade game, also by Capcom, was developed that same year under the title \"Nemo\".\n\n"}

Music was customary at funerals, and the \"tibia\" (Greek \"aulos\"), a woodwind instrument, was played at sacrifices to ward off ill influences. Song \"(carmen)\" was an integral part of almost every social occasion. The \"Secular Ode\" of Horace, for instance, was commissioned by Augustus and performed by a mixed children's choir at the Secular Games in 17 BC. Under the influence of ancient Greek theory, music was thought to reflect the orderliness of the cosmos, and was associated particularly with mathematics and knowledge. \n\nEtruscan music had an early influence on that of the Romans. During the Imperial period, Romans carried their music to the provinces, while traditions of Asia Minor, North Africa and Gaul became a part of Roman culture.\n\nMusic accompanied spectacles and events in the arena, and was part of the performing arts form called \"pantomimus\", an early form of story ballet that combined expressive dancing, instrumental music and a sung libretto.\n\nThe Romans may have borrowed the Greek method of 'enchiriadic notation' to record their music, if they used any notation at all. Four letters (in English notation 'A', 'G', 'F' and 'C') indicated a series of four successive tones. Rhythm signs, written above the letters, indicated the duration of each note.\n\nThe Romans may have tuned their instruments to Greek modes.\n\nRoman art depicts various woodwinds, \"brass\", percussion and stringed instruments. Roman-style instruments are found in parts of the Empire where they did not originate, and indicate that music was among the aspects of Roman culture that spread throughout the provinces.\n\n\nMosaics depict instruments that look like a cross between the bagpipe and the organ. The pipes were sized so as to produce many of the modes (scales) known from the Greeks. It is unclear whether they were blown by the lungs or by some mechanical bellows. \n\nThe hydraulic pipe organ \"(hydraulis)\", which worked by water pressure, was \"one of the most significant technical and musical achievements of antiquity\". Essentially, the air to the pipes that produce the sound comes from a mechanism of a wind-chest connected by a pipe to a dome submerged in a tank of water. Air is pumped into the top of the dome, compressing the air and forcing water out the bottom; the displace water rises in the tank. This increased hydraulic head and the compression of the air in the dome provides a steady supply of air to the pipes (also see Pipe organ#History). The instrument goes back to the ancient Greeks and a well-preserved model in pottery was found at Carthage in 1885.\n\nThe \"hydraulis\" accompanied gladiator contests and events in the arena, as well as stage performances. It might also be found in homes, and was among the instruments that the emperor Nero played.\n\n\nIn spite of the purported lack of musical originality on the part of the Romans, they did enjoy music greatly and used it for many activities. Music was also used in religious ceremonies. The Romans cultivated music as a sign of education. Music contests were quite common and attracted a wide range of competition, including Nero himself, who performed widely as an amateur and once traveled to Greece to compete.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "15428941", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15428941", "title": "RASL", "text": "RASL\n\nRASL is a 2013 graphic novel by cartoonist Jeff Smith. A sci-fi noir, it is the story of RASL (Dr. Robert Joseph Johnson), an art thief who jumps to parallel universes in attempts to steal famous paintings, but runs into danger as he is pursued by the government.\n\n\"RASL\" draws influences from real-life events, people, and places, including Nikola Tesla, Southwestern Native American culture, and hardboiled crime fiction. The book's central storyline is narrated extensively through the protagonist's thoughts, aided by the use of flashbacks to tell the story of his past. Smith's art style is high-contrast black-and-white, and is notably more detailed and \"human\" than his previous work \"Bone\". \n\"RASL\" originally appeared in serial form in an independently published black-and-white comic book published from 2008–2012.\n\nJeff Smith has stated that \"RASL\" came from a desire to do something completely different from his previous work \"Bone\". He came up with the idea in 1999 during the process of inking \"Bone\", inspired by his thoughts of how films like \"Blade Runner\" and the Bourne film series could come together. Smith then talked to cartoonists Paul Pope and Frank Miller about the idea and gained support. Smith postponed his idea on \"RASL\" as to complete \"Bone\", and came back to it in 2007. He developed an idea of how the story would end and what would happen but needed to organize it into a full-fledged story. He flew out to Arizona, as he knew the story would be set in the desert. He found the quiet and heat helped him develop his ideas for the story and characters. Smith was also interested in the visual aspects of film noir, such as intense angles, heavy shadows, and a sense of discomfort. He then spent a year researching the latest in the theories of physics, M-theory, and string theory from the work of Brian Greene, Stephen Hawking, and Carl Sagan to get a feel of what scientists believe is happening with parallel worlds.\n\nSelf-published through Smith's publishing company Cartoon Books, the first issue of \"RASL\" was released in February 2008. Originally planned for three issues a year at 32 pages, the format was changed as of issue #5 to 24 pages (22 pages of comics, and a two-page letter column titled \"RASLetters\") for less wait in between. Issue #6 was delayed for an extensively long time, from October 2009 to January 2010. According to creator Jeff Smith's blog, the series was to go bimonthly with issue #7.\n\nEarlier in the series' production, it was unclear whether \"RASL\" was supposed to be a limited series or a standard ongoing series. However, in response to a fan's post on Smith's Facebook page on August 1, 2010, he commented; \"I'm not sure how many issues there will be exactly, but you'll probably only have to be collecting \"RASL\" for about two more years\", confirming that it was in fact an ongoing series, and that Smith estimated the series to end somewhere between 2012 and 2013. Smith hinted in the \"RASLetters\" section of issue #10 that either issue #15 or #16 would be the final issue of the series. Ultimately, the series ended with issue #15 in August 2012.\n\n\nThe following synopses are cited directly from the collected editions of RASL, respectively.\n\nThe story opens to RASL, a dimension-jumping art thief with a tattoo of a woman's name (Maya) on his left arm, wandering in a desert battered and bloody. He recollects his memories on a job where he steals a Picasso painting (\"The Old Guitarist\"). After tagging the location of the painting, RASL escapes from the police by using an immersion suit (resembling 4 airplane turbines strapped to his shoulders and legs and an African mask) to enter \"The Drift\", a place where he is able to travel to other dimensions.\n\nHe comes to a seemingly regular world and hides his suit, then visits a bar where he is the only one present. After some drinks and lighting a cigar, he looks through the songs on the jukebox, noticing that Bob Dylan's \"Blonde on Blonde\" album is instead credited to Robert Zimmerman, which is Bob Dylan's birthname. He realizes he is in the wrong place. As he is about to leave, an eerie assassin with a lizard like face comes in and shoots at RASL; as he escapes his painting is shot.\n\nOutside the assassin chases him and a fight ensues, to which RASL beats and disarms the man. He finds no I.D. and is startled to see a small rectangle block in the man’s wrist. Hearing sirens, he decides to go find a quiet place to meditate for a couple of hours (to be put in a more zen-like state of purity so he may enter the Drift again) thinking to himself about how he knew someone could \"figure it out eventually\". His final lines as he meditates in the light of the moon are \"You can fix this. It’s never too late to fix it.\" The story then cuts back to him one last time wandering in the desert.\n\nRASL drives back into town after having returned to the real world. He comes to his client's house (a prostitute named Annie). Inviting him in, she notices RASL is in bad shape, and asks if he was \"time traveling again\". He corrects her by explaining that he jumps dimensions using \"thermo-magnetic engines to bend the space\" around him. Annie notices the painting was shot in the foot and she can never show it to anyone. During a conversation RASL asks if Annie has seen the lizard face assassin (mentioning he was from \"The Compound.\") We also learn that under the assassin's wrist was a security chip. She has not seen the man. RASL is frustrated that \"they\" are unable to control him, so they sent an assassin.\n\nAnnie shows him a medallion depicting \"The Man in the Maze\" (a nickname for the I'itoi) which represents the journey of life and its turning points. During the conversation we see his point of view as he travels dimensions, mentioning while he is in the void, there are portals, and he goes through the one he sees. Annie believes that worlds also choose him. Later the two have sex and fall asleep. RASL wakes up later worried he felt something wrong (nervous he might be in the wrong place). However, Bob Dylan exists in this world and RASL decides to go out to a strip club and drink.\n\nHe returns later to find that Annie has been murdered, and a heart shape ripped from the painting covered in blood on Annie. RASL knows he must go after the assassin and gets his jeep. As he drives past The Compound he narrates about when he first played with magnets and learned Maxwell's equations to make his immersion suit. He asserts that \"nothing is certain in the world of quantum physics.\" He gives an example of this by stating how electrons are not able to be pinned down in an atom. He narrates: \"I can’t remember where I heard the theory that these particles were actually leaking into other dimensions. But I can remember the first time I followed one.\" He then burns the Picasso painting on a mountain top and uses his immersion suit to enter The Drift in a blast of light.\n\nRASL re-enters the world where \"Dylan isn't Dylan\" on the same abandoned mountain top from Chapter 2 after having counted to 10. With his jeep gone he walks into town. At a bus stop he sees the Man in the Maze symbol used as an ad for a Maze of Life exhibit for a museum. As he contemplates finding a Jeep, he meets a shady character who introduces himself as \"The President of the Street\". RASL pays him 40 dollars for his help in finding a vehicle. Soon after, RASL begins his drive to the museum (during this we learn that he counts while drifting so he can focus and not black out). Blacking out is how he came to the current dimension the first time. Assuming Annie’s killer is following him, he wonders how he got the technology but admits it wouldn't be hard to master. However he mentions that two people saw his (RASL's) complete designs, and that one of them is dead.\n\nThe story flashes back to when he worked for The Compound (a military base). He works with a man named Miles and his wife Maya. We learn RASL’s name is Robert, and that he and his partners are working on a \"St. George Array\" (based on ideas by Nikola Tesla). According to Miles it’s an anti weapon which serves as a barrier against missiles. RASL feels reluctant going through with the plans, but Miles points out that in the past he supported Robert’s teleportation suits (t-suits). At this time, however, they do not function properly. The phone rings and Miles answers the call and tells them the project has now been green-lit and the budget doubled. While he gets a bottle of champagne Maya kisses RASL saying \"Even if you could leave him, I know you can't leave me\" (indicating an affair between them). Maya tells Miles Robert won't back out, leaving Robert himself unsure of the future.\n\nIn the museum he meets the curator who looks exactly like Maya who in this dimension doesn’t know him (instead her name is Uma Giles.) After showing her the silver medallion to examine she says it looks like Hopi silverwork, though his “friend” (Annie) was part Pima. He leaves the museum shortly after making plans to meet her again, reeling from the experience. He decides to visit Annie’s house. As RASL is about to leave (after watching a client walk out of her house), the assassin with the lizard like face pulls up in a car to come kill her. RASL enters and sees the man has her hostage and greets him by his first name telling him, \"You have something that belongs to us and we want it back.\"\n\nRASL takes the gun and points it at the assassin but is startled when the assassin says that there are infinitely many different Annie’s but only one of he and Robert. A brutal fight ensues while Annie picks up the gun and aims it at both of them. The assassin runs outside while RASL makes sure Annie is ok. Outside, the assassin (with his own immersion suit) enters The Drift. RASL prepares to do the same telling Annie to get to safety. She asks where he is going, to which he replies “After him!” He enters the Drift, leaving this dimension’s Annie with the gun, in awe and bewildered.\n\nThe story opens with RASL declaring himself a liar, in a world filled with liars. And that even a liar can find it difficult to tell what is truth and what is legend. During this, a boat spots a life raft holding a dead (and possibly mutated) sailor. We learn that this is 6 days prior to the Philadelphia Experiment, which is narrated as follows:\n\nIn September 1943, a military convoy is leaving from Casablanca bound for Norfolk Virginia via the Atlantic (waters patrolled by German submarines in this era). As the ships pass within 100 miles from Bermuda, an immense flash is seen on the horizon, followed by the muffled sounds of depth charges. A distress call is picked up yet no ships or German subs are seen. 2 days pass and the calls and noises persist. The next day, the dead sailor is found. On the sixth night, a loud succession of explosions is heard and an unknown ship is seen with its stern on fire. Alarm is issued and the traveling boat goes to rescue the other. As they approach, it is gone and not seen nor detected on radar. Going further, the sailors look down into a trench in the shape of a hull. A loud pop of electricity is heard and the sailors look shocked at what is described as \"a man-made horror/a travesty of nature.\" RASL narrates that this incident is the beginning of a series of lies that leads to the current point in his story. A quiet barrio in Tucson.\n\nRe-emerging from the Drift once more in a new dimension with the assassin, another brutal fight ensues at night in the street in a suburb area. The assassin draws his gun and points it at RASL, warning him to stay put. He looks at RASL, stating he looks nothing like his picture (addressing him by his full name, Robert Joseph Johnson). He notices drifting is killing him. The assassin asks if RASL came to \"return the stolen property\", but RASL has come only because of Annie's murder. The assassin warns RASL that he is meddling with forces he can't control, and that none of the worlds RASL visits are real, which is why he has never met himself. The assassin then reveals his name as Sal, that he is working for the Compound, and that they believe RASL has 2 journals stolen from the navy. He offers a truce for the journals in exchange for not killing RASL's \"girlfriends\" for 48 hours. RASL tries to make a grab for him but falls on the street, as Sal teleports away. Suddenly, he notices a very eerie and silent little girl who disappears quickly.\n\nHe goes to a nearby bar to drink and collect his thoughts. We learn through this that Nikola Tesla was working on magnetic fields for ships to detect German ships and repel mines during World War I. The assistant secretary of the navy at the time is Franklin Delano Roosevelt. FDR becomes president and discusses the magnetic project with Albert Einstein during the period of the Manhattan Project during World War II. RASL had seen the data of a full-scale test in which a ship blinked in and out of existence several times over 6 days; the experiment had horrific results, making the navy want to \"close that door\". However, RASL says he opened it again 2 years ago.\n\nHe walks out of the bar and sees the eerie girl again, who slaps the ground where he appeared and points to Annie's house. Unsure of what to make of this, RASL puts on his suit and returns once more to the dimension with no Bob Dylan. Checking on Annie, he is worried she doesn't know who he is. She addresses him as Robert, assures him and kisses him. As they do this, RASL slowly shuts the door of her house.\n\nThe story continues the morning after Anne and RASL have sex with Annie expressing her disbelief and amazement at RASL's explanation of his drifting technology. We learn that his first test was done in a desert of Arizona (where the story takes place) and it took 3 days to realize he was on another world. Knowing that this dimension's Annie saw the suit, Robert plans to leave to pull a new heist to get money while Annie can go somewhere safe. Annie questions RASL about her alternate versions RASL has seen or slept with. Asking why RASL wants to be with her, he simply says it is because they both are there. Keeping in mind that he destroyed The Compound's multibillion-dollar weapons division, he plans to not give the journals to them. Rob leaves, bloody and hurt from Drifting and has a short black out before and during driving.\n\nDuring the second blackout the story flashes back to Robert coming back in the lab looking ill (we see the mask of his immersion suit hanging on the wall amongst other objects). RASL confesses that he tested a t-suit, that it worked, and expresses his want to postpone the St. George Array test (and shut down the Tesla Division) to analyze the calculations of his trip. Miles expresses his frustration and wonders if anything has to do with Robert and Maya's trip to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. Afterward, Miles picks up the phone and tells RASL to stick to a story, and that the head of security is arriving.\n\nAfter the blackout, he pulls over and starts walking and sees the strange girl from Chapter 4 holding hands with a woman on the sidewalk (this is the second world he has seen her). Shortly, Maya (the Uma version) drives up to give him a ride to the museum to get his necklace (which Annie gave him). She offers him a private tour. During the drive, the story flashes back to Robert and Maya having sex during the Wright Patt trip (confirming Miles' suspicions). Maya confesses she wishes to be with Robert all the time. They discuss their schedule which includes a research meeting and another meeting with H.A.A.R.P. to discuss Maya's bio-theories on low frequencies. RASL plans to go to the archives to check out U.F.O. conspiracies.\n\nThe story returns to RASL staring at Maya as she gives a tour, and notices he isn't listening, smiling seductively. The story then flashes back to when RASL meets Alvin Bester, a man who works in the archives. He tells RASL of his reputation he's been building and also reminds him of his desire to shut down the Tesla Division. Bester gives RASL Nikola Tesla's 2 missing journals. RASL has a look of shock and fright upon reading one of the journals. The story flashes back to Maya and RASL embraced, kissing in the museum.\n\nThe story continues after the date with Maya with RASL reflecting on his and Miles' fascination with the life of Nikola Tesla and his \"electrification\" of the world. His exposition includes Tesla's relationship and rivalry with Thomas Edison, which leads into a further explanation of the War of Currents. Halfway through this, RASL is seen breaking into a parallel version of the penthouse from Chapter 1 to obtain a new Old Guitarist painting.\n\nHe continues his story of Tesla by emphasizing that he felt electricity was a life force, and made plans to create wireless energy transmissions in a laboratory in the Colorado Rockies. The story then goes back to RASL to show that his job was successful as he receives pay from the owner of a casino (who allows RASL to go and enjoy it). The story jumps back into a further narration of Tesla's competition, specifically Guglielmo Marconi. Meanwhile, the company which Tesla and his partner George Westinghouse ran was in financial trouble, but Tesla temporarily saved it. The story goes to the present in the real world to a scene where RASL brings the painting to his friend Pauly in a casino office. Pauly gives RASL a free pass to enjoy the casino. RASL continues his recollection of Tesla.\n\nUltimately the residents in the area of Tesla's lab grew tired of the thunder being emitted, and he left to go meet J.P. Morgan. After working for Morgan, he is abandoned for Marconi (being that he became the first to transmit signals over the Atlantic Ocean). RASL for a moment sympathizes with Tesla but lets his story serve as a cautionary tale as he sits at a poker table with a drink. Sal approaches him from behind to confront him, questioning him as to why he does not have the journals. After realizing the casino set him up (because security isn't called to his aide), RASL tries to fight Sal drunk, but is smashed over the head with the butt of his gun.\n\nThe story continues with RASL narrating The Tunguska Event, expressing his belief that Nikola Tesla's attempt at putting his world system on line was the cause. The story then flashes back to The Compound. Robert and Miles' friendship has fallen apart with Robert having left the St. George project but persistent in advising Miles not to test the weapon. Miles is skeptical at RASL's advisions, seeing that he had, without authorization, taken the t-suit and accidentally discovered other worlds. During an exchange, RASL reveals his knowledge of the existence of Tesla's journals. Miles, infuriated that RASL had kept them secret, throws a laptop through a window. Ranting in an almost madness-driven manner. Maya comes in worried to break up the fight, to which Miles (reading Robert and Maya's faces) realizes their affair. RASL is taken out of the building by security, stating that after seven years of research, his time at The Compound was done. Three days before the St. George test, however, Robert returns to take his t-suit and drifts, conscious of it for the first time (and jamming the array in the process). Because of the electromagnetic effects drifting and a guilty conscience, RASL develops a drinking habit.\n\nHe wakes up in the present after the confrontation with Sal in the casino office from Chapter 6 (located in Las Vegas). Present in the room is Sal, along with Kalani Adams, the security head of the compound. Sal's full name is revealed as Salvador Crow, and that he has undergone training under the authority of The Department of Homeland Security. Also—that he is part of a \"watchdog group\" created by the Patriot Act. In conversation with Kalani, it is learned the department considers the new worlds (if real) a potential security risk. RASL expresses that they are real, to which Sal is disgusted by the thought of considering that so. We also learn that the St. George array is being rebuilt. RASL reveals his t-suit works because energy is shared in all the universes and that energy is transferred. In addition he states the barrier is thin and trying to create the St. George weapon is ill-advised, because an energy gusher could be opened up causing devastating consequences. Choosing to see this as a way to convince RASL to bring her the journals, Kalani offers an ultimatum to bring them in 24 hours or be locked away.\n\nRASL is taken away by Sal and tossed out on the edge of town, telling him that he is still seeking out Annie. RASL's narration of the past is further revealed as he states that three days after jamming the weapon, he drifted back to Tucson and rented a jeep, knowledgeable of where he hid the journals. After driving out of town, he recalls seeing a flash in the mirror, and witnesses (along with other drivers who had gotten out of their cars) a devastating explosion from The Compound. The story flashes back to the present one last time with RASL standing in the desert where Sal left him, with the eerie girl he'd met earlier right behind him.\n\nWe pick up right from the end of the last chapter with RASL reflecting back on his motto, \"It's never too late to fix it.\" He thinks back to a warning that Annie gave him— That he is an addictive personality and would run back to Maya, even if her motives seemed suspect. We then flash to a new scene in which Robert breaks off the affair with Maya (much to her dismay). We then jump to RASL watching the news after the explosion at the Compound (talked about at the end of Chapter 7). The entire team which includes Miles is rescued, but not Maya. We then cut to a scene in which RASL gets a tattoo in her memory. We jump two years later (to the present) and RASL realizes there is the eerie little girl is standing behind him.\n\nRASL tries to communicate with the girl and see if she followed him from a parallel universe. But she motions for RASL to take off his jacket, and then crosses out Maya's name on his arm (to RASL's confusion). She then draws a diagram in the dirt which shocks RASL, as he backs away he bumps into The President of the Street, who recognizes RASL from their last meet (in Chapter 3) despite them not being in the world in which they met. RASL asks if the man knows who the little girl is, and he states that she is God.\n\nRASL contemplates God, existence and the origins of the universe through various Native American myths and stories. Included is a visual reference to the Man in the Maze who is described as \"Elder Brother\". We then pick up from where we left off, with RASL walking along in the desert to town and The President of the Streets behind him with the little girl (who he claims to be God). The President is recalling a story of how he saw a UFO when RASL stops momentarily to question the man's claim of the little girl being God. When The President makes references to Nikola Tesla and his downfall, RASL suddenly takes hold of the man angrily, and the little girl calms him down.\n\nRASL explains to her that the drawing she made in the sand in the previous chapter is from Tesla's journals. The diagram/drawing makes reference to his Unified Field Theory which explains the ideas of dimensions and universes overlapping, along with shared energy. RASL explains that in order to tap into those dimensions, high frequencies of energy are needed, which would crack a hole in reality itself (which he states is what happened in The Philadelphia Experiment). He also worries that that is exactly what will happen if the St. George array is activated.\n\nRASL decides to go and get Annie like he planned (after he'd side-tracked in Las Vegas in Chapter 6) and The President and the girl seem to vanish. RASL goes to a parking garage to pick up his Jeep and finds a figure going through his trunk, dressed in a T-Suit. He chases the figure, and is positive it isn't Sal (because of the person's dexterity and height). He almost catches the figure but they drift out of his reach with the T-Suit engines. RASL muses that he'll have to keep his Jeep locked up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRASL has been collected into the following oversized (10\" by 12\") trade paperbacks:\nThe collection of \"The Drift\" has been released in a hardcover edition (), limited to 3000 copies. The collection of \"The Drift\" also features extra story pages along with bonus material.\n\nThe series is also being released in \"Pocket Book\" format (measuring 8.9 by 6.4 by 0.6 inches). Due to the release of these, the previous oversized collected editions were renamed the \"RASL Giant Artist Editions\". It has been confirmed that despite the release of the pocket books, the \"RASL Giant Artist Editions\" will be kept in print and continued. Smith said in the \"RASLetters\" of \"Issue #10\" that there would be either one or two more \"RASL Giant Artist Editions\" (if one, then the one would contain more pages than usual, while if two, they may contain less pages than usual), while there will be one more \"RASL Pocket Book Edition\":\nThe entire series was colored and collected as a single 472 page hardcover in September, 2013 ().\n\n\"RASL\" has been optioned for a film by Lionel Wigram.\n\n"}
{"id": "38971239", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38971239", "title": "Ralph Breaks the Internet", "text": "Ralph Breaks the Internet\n\nRalph Breaks the Internet (originally titled Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2) is a 2018 American 3D computer-animated comedy film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Pictures as well as the studio's 57th feature-length film. It is the second installment of the \"Wreck-It Ralph\" film series and the sequel to the 2012 film \"Wreck-It Ralph\". It is directed by Rich Moore and Phil Johnston, written by Johnston and Pamela Ribon, and executive-produced by John Lasseter, Chris Williams, and Jennifer Lee. It features John C. Reilly, Sarah Silverman, Jack McBrayer, Jane Lynch, and Ed O'Neill reprising their roles from the first film, with Alan Tudyk returning to voice a new character, alongside new additions to the cast including Gal Gadot, Taraji P. Henson, Bill Hader (in an uncredited role), and Alfred Molina.\n\nTalks for a \"Wreck-It Ralph\" sequel began in October 2012, and went through three different scripts before settling on the final plot. The film was officially announced in June 2016, with much of the original cast confirming they had signed on, with new members being added in 2018. It marks the first feature-length theatrical sequel from Walt Disney Animation Studios since \"Winnie the Pooh\" in 2011, which was a sequel to the 1977 animated film \"The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\". It is also the studio's first animated sequel to be created by the original film's writing/directing team.\n\n\"Ralph Breaks the Internet\" had its world premiere at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on November 5, 2018, and was released in the United States on November 21, 2018. The film has grossed $207 million worldwide and has received mostly positive reviews from critics, who called it a \"worthy successor\" and praised the animation, humor, characters and storyline, as well as the vocal performances of Reilly and Silverman.\n\nWreck-It Ralph and Vanellope von Schweetz have been best friends since their misadventures six years ago, hanging out every night after work in Litwak's Family Fun Center and Arcade. While Ralph is content, Vanellope admits being bored with her game's predictability as they learn that Mr. Litwak installed a Wi-Fi router. Ralph's attempt to cheer her up by creating a secret bonus track for her causes her to override the player controls to race on it, resulting with the steering wheel controller accidentally destroyed. Though one of the kids finds a replacement wheel on eBay after he reveals the company that made \"Sugar Rush\" is defunct, Mr. Litwak finds it too expensive and has no choice but to unplug \"Sugar Rush\" with the game's citizens left homeless.\n\nAfter a conversation with Fix-It Felix Jr. in Tapper's when a despondent Vanellope doesn't show up, Ralph decides to enter the Internet to obtain the new wheel on eBay. Ralph brings Vanellope with him as they reach eBay and buy the wheel, finding they need money to pay the winning bid within 24 hours of purchase. The two turn to a pop-up advertiser named Spamley to make money fast, given the advertiser's most expensive job which requires them to steal a valuable car belonging to Shank from the violent online game \"Slaughter Race\". Ralph and Vanellope steal the car, but are forced to return it after a high-speed chase, Shank complimenting Vanellope's driving skills before recording a concerned Ralph being humiliated and pointing the pair toward the video sharing site BuzzzTube. After meeting with its chief algorithm Yesss and learning that he made a profit, Ralph decides to subject himself to a series of videos playing off popular trends to pay eBay.\n\nAs Ralph's videos become a viral sensation, Vanellope joins Yesss's staff in spamming users with pop-up ads. But Ralph convinces Yesss to send Vanellope to a Disney fansite, where she meets the Disney Princesses while escaping from First Order Stormtroopers. Despite learning of the hurtful comments that users made on his videos, Ralph successfully earns enough money to cover the eBay bid. When Ralph contacts Vanellope when she doesn't show up to eBay after calling her prior to her musical epiphany, he inadvertently overhears her confessing to Shank that she wants to stay in \"Slaughter Race\". Desperate to not lose Vanellope, Ralph turns to Spamley for a way to make \"Slaughter Race\" too boring for Vanellope just like what happened when they are playing Tron. Ralph is taken by Spamley to meet Double Dan, a virus designer hiding in the dark web, and receives an Insecurity Virus which replicates any flaw it finds. When Ralph unleashes the virus in \"Slaughter Race\", it replicates Vanellope's glitch across the game with Vanellope almost killed when the server reboots.\n\nWhen Ralph admits his misdeed to Vanellope when she assumed the crash was her fault, she angrily leaves after taking the medal she made for him and throwing it away. But as Ralph recovers the broken medal, the virus escapes from \"Slaughter Race\" and scans Ralph's insecurities. This results in a legion of Ralph clones that destroy the Internet to find Vanellope. The real Ralph finds her as they and Yesss attempt to lead the clones to an anti-virus software trap as said by a search result from Knowsmore. But the plan fails when Ralph clones aggregate into a giant Ralph that grabs Vanellope with Ralph fighting a losing battle, Vanellope surrendering as Ralph was about to get killed. But Ralph refuses to accept this and calls the clones out on their possessiveness while admitting that Vanellope's desire to enter \"Slaughter Race\" does not mean that their friendship must end. With his insecurities resolved, Ralph falls as the clones disintegrate before being saved by the Disney Princesses. The Internet is restored and Vanellope decides to stay in \"Slaughter Race\" after Shank arranged her to respawn in her new home, giving her half of his medal. As \"Sugar Rush\" is plugged back in, Ralph comes to terms with changes as he begins participating in social activities with other game characters while staying in touch with Vanellope through video chats.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Ralph and Vanellope crash a child's Pancake Milkshake game on her tablet. In a post-credits scene, a \"Frozen 2\" trailer is teased, only for Ralph to rickroll the audience, making it clickbait.\n\n\nAll of the Disney Princesses appear, including: Jennifer Hale as Cinderella, Kate Higgins as Aurora, Jodi Benson as Ariel, Paige O'Hara as Belle, Linda Larkin as Jasmine, Irene Bedard as Pocahontas, Ming-Na Wen as Mulan, Anika Noni Rose as Tiana, Mandy Moore as Rapunzel, and Kelly Macdonald as Merida, all of whom reprise their roles from previous films and other media, while screenwriter Pamela Ribon voices Snow White. Also returning from other films are Kristen Bell as Anna, Idina Menzel as Elsa, and Auliʻi Cravalho as Moana.\n\nAdditionally, Roger Craig Smith reprises his role as Sonic the Hedgehog, Maurice LaMarche reprises his role as Tapper the bartender from \"Tapper\", Brian Curless voices himself, an auctioneer, and the film's directors Rich Moore and Phil Johnston voice auction bidders. Colleen Ballinger, Dani Fernandez, and Tiffany Herrera voice cameo as themselves . Tim Allen, Anthony Daniels, Vin Diesel, Michael Giacchino, Brad Garrett, and Corey Burton reprise their roles as Buzz Lightyear, C-3PO, Baby Groot, FN-3181, Eeyore, and Grumpy, respectively. Moore also reprises his roles from the first film as Sour Bill and Zangief. Moore, Kevin Deters, Jeremy Milton and Jesse Averna voice First Order Stormtroopers.\n\nKatie Lowes and Jamie Elman reprise their roles as \"Sugar Rush\" racers Candlehead and Rancis Fluggerbutter, respectively, while \"SNL\" cast member and impressionist Melissa Villaseñor replaces Mindy Kaling as \"Sugar Rush\" racer Taffyta Muttonfudge.\n\nSimilar to the first film, which included a number of cameos and references to video games, \"Ralph Breaks the Internet\" has additional features to Internet culture and to various Disney properties, including their own films, Pixar films, the \"Star Wars\", Marvel Comics, and The Muppets franchises. Mickey Mouse, Grumpy, Dumbo, Humphrey the Bear, Eeyore, Tinker Bell, Nick Wilde, Heihei, Buzz Lightyear, Baymax, C-3PO, R2-D2, Yoda, First Order Stormtroopers, Iron Man, Judy Hopps, Kermit the Frog, EVE, Rocket Raccoon, and Baby Groot also appear in the film, along with the video game characters Q*Bert, Pac-Man, Clyde, Inky, Taizo Hori, Ken Masters, Chun-Li, Ryu, Zangief, M. Bison, Peter Pepper, Frogger, Tapper, Sonic the Hedgehog, and Doctor Eggman from the original film. The band Imagine Dragons (whose song \"Zero\" is featured in a trailer for the film, as well as its soundtrack) make a cameo appearance in the film, with the members voicing themselves.\n\nStan Lee, Marvel Comics' former writer, editor and publisher, makes a posthumous cameo appearance in the film talking to Iron Man.\n\nThe filmmakers revealed that the film originally featured a joke about Kylo Ren being a \"spoiled child\", which was later cut from the film by request from Lucasfilm. Like the first film, it does not have a Mario cameo despite the promise they would include him. In addition, the film would originally include \"The Golden Girls\" characters, but it was later cut because the directors felt it was a bizarre juxtaposition.\n\nLike the first film, it will have also licensed references from brands, trademarks and famous websites including ones from social media. Some include Google, eBay, Amazon, Fandango, Snapchat, YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook.\n\nIn October 2012, director Rich Moore said that he and Disney had ideas about a sequel that would bring the characters up to date and explore online gaming and console gaming. Moore stated that many of the crew and voice cast were open to the sequel, believing that they have \"barely scratched the surface\" of the video game world they envisioned. He also stated that he planned to include Mario and Tron in the sequel. (In the end, only the latter appeared briefly, serving as a minor foreshadowing plot device.) In 2014, the first film's composer Henry Jackman said that a story for the sequel was being written. In July 2015, John C. Reilly said he had signed on to reprise his role of Ralph in a projected sequel.\n\nOn March 24, 2016, Moore stated that a sequel was still being planned. Moore specifically stated that a sequel would include an appearance from Mario, citing a \"good relationship with Nintendo\". On June 30, 2016, Walt Disney Animation Studios announced that the sequel would be released on March 9, 2018, with Reilly, Moore and writer Phil Johnston attached, and that it would focus on \"Ralph leaving the arcade and wrecking the Internet\".\n\nIn March 2017, the sequel's title was officially announced as \"Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2\", with Moore returning as director joined by the first film's co-writer, Phil Johnston, in his directing debut in an animated film and Clark Spencer also returning as producer. In July 2018, Disney removed \"Wreck-it Ralph 2\" from the film's title.\n\nTwo working versions of the script had been scrapped before settling on the one used for the film, according to head writer Josie Trinidad. In one version, Vanellope had become self-absorbed by the Internet, gaining popularity and becoming a celebrity among the users. Ralph had been thrown in jail where he met the search engine Knowsmore, and they had partnered together to escape prison and help bring Vanellope back to her normal self. A second version had Ralph becoming an Internet-famous celebrity, and would have been challenged by an anti-virus program named Bev that served as a super cop and would have been the story's villain. Trinidad said neither of these versions captured what they felt was the centerpiece of the sequel, being how Ralph and Vanellope reacted to the new world of the Internet and realizing they have separate paths going forward.\n\nProducer Clark Spencer said that \"the film is about change. Two best friends are about to realize that the world won’t always be the same. The internet is the perfect setting, really, because it’s all about change—things change by the second\". Director of story Jim Reardon said that it was intimidating to set the film on the Internet, stating that \"[They] looked at how [they] could make the internet relatable on a human level—like how Game Central Station aka the power strip mirrored a train station in the first movie. In ‘Ralph Breaks the Internet,’ any person who uses the internet has a little avatar version of themselves that does their business for them\". Reardon, however, said that Disney \"didn’t want to make the movie about the internet\", wanting to instead focus on Ralph and Vanellope's friendship, wanting to instead treat the Internet as \"the place where the movie takes place\". Josie Trinidad claimed that the filmmakers \"didn’t want to just give the audience more of that friendship — [people had] to see that relationship grow.\"\n\nThe design of the scenes within the Internet was based on tours made of One Wilshire in Los Angeles, as it is one of the world's largest telecommunications centers, serving most traffic around the Pacific Ocean. The filmmakers did not approach any of the companies (outside of Disney) that are represented in the Internet, and strived to include net branding from all across the world. They also had to explore various Internet memes, making sure to avoid those that lacked long-term presence on the Internet. While the film addresses many positive elements of the Internet, the filmmakers did not want to shy away from covering some of the more unpleasant aspects about it, in part fueled by the success of tackling racism indirectly within \"Zootopia\". Such elements include Ralph reading through comment sections on videos to find users leaving disparaging messages about him, and having the pair travel to the dark web with its activities of questionable legal and ethical status. They wanted to follow the same approach as they had with Judy Hopps in \"Zootopia\", where she experienced, learned, and overcame the racism aspects, and have Ralph similarly learn and become a better person without having to actually solve the issue of hostility on the Internet.\n\nThe scene where Vanellope is introduced to the Disney Princesses came from screenwriter Pamela Ribon. In 2014, Ribon was still working on \"Moana\" when Disney began internally pitching ideas for the sequel to \"Wreck-It Ralph\", Ribon recognized that like the title character of \"Moana\", Vanellope fits the definition of a Disney Princess. When work formally began on the sequel after the completion of \"Zootopia\", Ribon pitched the idea of Disney poking fun at itself by having Vanellope meet the other Disney Princesses in the green room of OhMyDisney.com, the Disney fan-driven website. Further inspiration came from a \"Buzzfeed\" online quiz that asked which Disney Princess the user was; Moore thought it would be interesting if Ralph had encountered that quiz and ended up in an argument with Vanellope over the result. Ribon's initial script for the scene, playing off the various tropes of the Princesses such as several being kidnapped or enslaved, remains mostly intact through production. Animators had to work out various techniques to take the different styles of animation into a single approach, and figure out the proportions of the characters to themselves using official figurines. \nReilly, Jane Lynch, Jack McBrayer, and Sarah Silverman were reported as being set to reprise their roles. In December 2016, Alan Tudyk confirmed his return in the sequel as a different character, named KnowsMore. In August 2018, actress Gal Gadot joined the film. The team was able to secure all the Disney Princesses' original voice actresses, save for Adriana Caselotti for Snow White, Ilene Woods for Cinderella, and Mary Costa for Aurora, as Caselotti and Woods passed away in 1997 and 2010 respectively while Costa retired from acting in 2000; Jennifer Hale and Kate Higgins, the current voice actresses for Cinderella and Aurora were hired for the film while Pamela Ribon, the film's co-screenwriter, performed Snow White's voice for temporary tracks, but the team considered it a good substitute, allowing Ribon to voice her in the final film.\n\nThe picture contains over 150 unique sets and 5,726 assets. It also included the highest number of characters in any Disney Animation film, with 434 individual characters with 6,752 variants.\n\nFollowing the initial trailer for the film, which included the first shots of the Disney Princesses, Tiana, the lead character from the 2009 film \"The Princess and the Frog\" and of African-American heritage, appeared to have a lighter skin tone, a narrower nose, and European features in \"Ralph Breaks the Internet\" than in the 2009 film. This led to some backlashes on social media as these drew her appearance away from that expected of African-Americans. As a result, Tiana's voice actress Anika Noni Rose and the advocacy group Color of Change contacted Disney to redesign Tiana for \"Ralph Breaks the Internet\" to make her look closer to her 2009 appearance, which was reintroduced in the second trailer. The same treatment was made given to Pocahontas, the titular character of the 1995 film, who had been pointed out by many viewers that she was given a much lighter skin tone.\n\nOne of the initial scenes created for the movie involved Ralph and Vanellope invading a childrens' game, involving feeding pancakes to a bunny to the point it appears to explode, subsequently frightening the child that was playing the game. This scene was featured in the film's original teaser, released in March 2018, and was heavily discussed in buzz about the film. Over time as they developed the rest of the film, they found the scene no longer fit in the film they were presenting. Knowing that audiences would be asking for this scene, it was moved to the mid-credits scene, along with additional fourth wall commentary about scenes shown in trailers that go missing in the final film. The final post-credits scene involves what starts as a teaser for the upcoming \"Frozen 2\" film (due in 2019) but ends up with Ralph \"rickrolling\" the audience by starting to sing Rick Astley's \"Never Gonna Give You Up\". While producers Spencer and Moore had an idea of Ralph doing a \"Wreck Roll\" early on in the film's development, they never incorporated it into the story. Late in production, they mentioned this to studio executives who told them they should add it in. As it was one of the last scenes added, the producers had gotten Reilly, who was on vacation with his family at the time, to come in to a New York studio to record for the day so that the animators could work from that.\n\nOn September 19, 2018, Imagine Dragons released the lead single from the soundtrack titled \"Zero\", which plays during the end credits of the movie. On October 23, 2018, the music video of \"Zero\" was posted on Imagine Dragons' YouTube channel. The film features an original song called \"A Place Called Slaughter Race\", performed by Sarah Silverman and Gal Gadot, written by Tom MacDougall and the film's co-director Phil Johntson, and the music was composed by Alan Menken, while the song's pop version, \"In This Place\", was performed by Julia Michaels. The film also features songs from various Disney Princess movies, as well as Demi Lovato's cover of \"Let it Go\" played in the beginning of the \"Oh My Disney\" scene. Ralph also rickrolls the tune \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" by Rick Astley in a post-credits scene. The soundtrack is composed by Henry Jackman, who also composed the score from the previous film. It was released digitally on November 16, 2018, and on CD on November 30, 2018.\n\nOn June 30, 2016, Walt Disney Animation Studios initially announced that the sequel, titled \"Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2\", would be released on March 9, 2018. However, in April 2017, \"A Wrinkle in Time\" took over its date, and the film was pushed back to November 21, 2018. In July 2018, Disney shortened the film's title to \"Ralph Breaks the Internet\". The film was released in 3D, 2D, Dolby Cinema and IMAX 3D.\n\nThe film was released in the United Kingdom on November 30. The first official clip named \"KnowsMore\" was released on World Internet Day, October 29, 2018. Another entitled \"Hearts\" was introduced on November 5, the same date where they start selling tickets before its release. On that same day, the film made its world premiere at Los Angeles’ El Capitan Theatre along with the song \"Zero\" played by Imagine Dragons at the event. A clip about \"There is no Track\", which was all about the new character Shank, is released on November 8. On November 19, a video clip of Vanellope meeting the Disney Princesses was released before the film's theatrical nationwide release two days later.\n\nA new poster for the film was released on February 26, 2018. Two days later, a teaser trailer for the film was released on February 28, 2018, and it quickly became viral, getting more than 4.5 million views in 24 hours. A second trailer was released on June 4, 2018 with the Daft Punk song \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\". In July 2018, Disney Animation opted to drop the \"Wreck-It Ralph 2\" moniker from the film's title, leaving it as \"Ralph Breaks the Internet\".\n\nA sneak peek of the film was released on August 10, 2018 that included the will.i.am song \"Geekin'\". Its final trailer was released on September 20, 2018 which included the song \"Never Gonna Give You Up\".\n\nCarvana and Disney collaborated to promote the film's release throughout a multi-channel campaign. Other brands who partnered with the film include McDonalds, Purple, and BAPE.\n\n, \"Ralph Breaks the Internet\" has grossed $119.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $87.7 million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $207 million, against a production budget of $175 million. \n\nIn the United States and Canada, \"Ralph Breaks the Internet\" was released alongside \"Creed II\" and \"Robin Hood\", as well as the wide expansion of \"Green Book\", and was originally projected to gross $67–77 million from 4,017 theaters in its five-day opening weekend. The film made $18.5 million on its first day (including a pre-Thanksgiving record $3.8 million from Tuesday night previews) and another $10.3 million on its second, increasing five-day projections to $85–95 million. It went on to debut to $56.2 million in its opening weekend (a five-day total of $84.8 million), finishing first at the box office and marking the second-best Thanksgiving opening behind Disney's \"Frozen\" ($93.5 million). In its second weekend the film made $25.8 million, dropping 54% but remaining in first.\n\nOn review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 88% based on 192 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"Ralph Breaks the Internet\" levels up on its predecessor with a funny, heartwarming sequel that expands its colorful universe while focusing on core characters and relationships.\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, calculated a weighted average score of 71 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale, down from the \"A\" earned by the first film, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it 4 out of 5 stars.\n\nBilge Ebiri, of \"The New York Times\", gave the film a positive review, saying that \"somewhere amid the film’s ornate imagery and deliriously irreverent humor, we might begin to realize that we’re watching a terrifying, incisive satire about the ways that a life lived online makes monsters of us all\". Brian Lowry, of \"CNN\", said that \"The colorful action should delight tykes, but the smart, media-savvy asides make it especially appealing to grownups\". Kerry Lengel, of \"The Arizona Republic\", gave the film 3.5 stars out of 5, saying that \"what makes the movie compelling, despite the subdued dramatic payoff, is that it is a heightened reflection of our experience—our love affair, really—with our gadgets, our apps and, yes, our brands\". Peter Hartalub, of \"The San Francisco Chronicle\", also gave the film 3 stars out of 4, stating that the film is \"almost always inspired in the moment\" and said that \"the new characters are all pretty great\", though he said that the film's first third \"struggles to find its focus\", and felt that Felix and Calhoun's subplot \"would have worked better as a pre-movie animated short\". Chris Bumbray, of \"JoBlo's Movie Emporium\", said that the film \"is just as solid\" as the first film, and said it was better than the science-fiction film \"Ready Player One\". Alex Hudson of \"Exclaim\" praised the film but criticized its \"brand synergy,\" calling it \"a peculiar piece of meta-fiction and a shameless advertisement for Disney's many subsidiary film studios.\" \n\nOliver Jones, of \"Observer\", gave the film 2.5 score, saying that \"\"Ralph Breaks the Internet\" is a candy coated, hard shined brick of postmodernism—a Vitamix smoothie of gags, nostalgia, product placement and Fruity Pebbles\". Alonso Duralde, of \"TheWrap\", said that \"Within a few years, the specifics of the viral-video gags in \"Ralph Breaks the Internet\" will be as dated as a Tay Zonday joke\". Peter Bradshaw, of \"The Guardian\", said that the \"sequel to the 2012 film is somewhere between \"Ready Player One\" and \"The Emoji Movie\", summoning up a zero-gravity spectacle of dazzling colours and vertiginous perspectives, a featureless and inert mashup of memes, brands, avatars and jokes\".\n\nDirectors Rich Moore and Phil Johnston said that a \"Ralph Breaks the Internet\" spin-off film focusing on the Disney Princesses could be made depending on the audience's response and \"if there's a good story to be told\".\n\n"}

{"id": "57430521", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57430521", "title": "Relationship aspect", "text": "Relationship aspect\n\nIn psychology and sociology, relationship aspect refers to the quality of interpersonal cooperation in terms of intuitive, emotional and social inner relatedness, which makes people feel connected outside of the content aspect.\n\nOpenness, honesty, reliability, emotional intelligence and other key skills are required to develop and deepen a good relationship.\n\nIn order for communication processes within familiar or business relationships and especially inside of romantic relationships to succeed, the quality of the relationship aspect is of prime importance. According to Sigmund Freud, trust, empathy, and shared values, along with preconceptions or fears and wishes, determine the success of interpersonal communication by more than 80 percent.\n\nThe iceberg model states that the relationship aspect has a much greater impact on communication than the content level, but also that it often works subconsciously.\n\nSocial competence generally refers to skills needed for social behavior. The term “social” can be understood within the field of social-psychology as “interpersonal”, sociological-value-neutral (as in “societal”) or as sociological-judgemental (as in “social-moral”). It describes the different dimensions of interpersonal relationships. Which interpersonal relationships and mismeetings (Martin Buber) will unfold, which conflicts may develop, and which of the existing conflicts can possibly be solved? Courage, the ability to overcome something, and risk are fundamental traits in developing social skills and stable relationships. Their quality can generally be measured on the basis of the status, power and influence within a social structure as well as the choice of partner.\n\nThe ability to develop stable relationships is strongly based on the following features:\n\n\nThe economic importance of the relationship aspect between employees and colleagues, or customers, or suppliers, becomes clear during business exchange processes, particularly within teams and in the sales area. Since trust is an essential factor for the disposition to engage in monetary exchange processes, considerable efforts are made in this area to secure a defined relationship aspect, with the help of electronic records (see: CRM).\n\nThe relationship aspect is of particular importance in the economic context for marketing. The economic importance of personal relationships is in no other sales area of marketing as important as it is here. Consequently, the success of networking depends very much on the number of people one knows and their level of trust. Naturally, these are first and foremost close relatives and good friends. These people are seen as potential customers and future independent employees. Visits to these people are primarily for the purpose of selling products and recruiting them to the business. In this context, aspects of business ethics also play a direct role.\n\nThe efforts to establish a mutually beneficial business relationship on the basis of a \"good relationship aspect\" are represented by various concepts in the spirit of the win-win strategy. The \"getting to yes\" theory, in particular, aims to make the relationship between the two parties as good as possible and the dispute as clear as necessary (principle: \"Separate the people from the problem\").\n\nWithin the argumentation, the relationship to the use of the relationship aspect is based on emotional arguments which are supported by preconceptions, personal references, experience and the credibility of the speaker. The logically valid deductive reasoning on the other hand completely excludes the relationship aspect between speaker and audience. Since Plato, dialectics has established itself as a school of argumentation. Dialectics aims to promote an inner understanding and willingness to compromise, comprising three stages of development: a thesis, an antithesis and a synthesis.\n\nAnother method for solving interpersonal conflicts in the relationship aspect has been successfully established with systemic therapy or systemic organisational development. All persons and institutions involved with their needs and expectations, as well as the interactions with each other, are considered neutral. In this way, it is usually possible to clarify the relationship disturbances beyond the pure reasoning approach.\n\nAnother form of conflict resolution for a disturbed relationship aspect is mediation. This person mediates between parties in order to find a pragmatic solution, usually a compromise. In contrast to more therapeutically oriented systemic work, mediation is more frequently encountered in business.\n\nFrom the theoretical background of psychoanalysis, Gestalt therapy and humanistic psychology, a third concept has been established, called theme-centered interaction, which was developed by the educator and psychoanalyst Ruth Cohn to improve relationships within groups. The aim of TCI is to open up better possibilities of communication through understanding interrelationships and through emotional experience. The result is an interaction model that treats the person, the group and the task as a model unit, where each is equally important and where the context of communication is always taken into consideration.\n\nThe genogram has been established as an instrument for the graphical representation of a bipolar or polypolar relationship aspect. Dependencies and informal structures that would be hardly recognizable on the surface can be visualized more easily with the help of graphical relationship lines between the participants. The mediator, the systemic organizational developer, or the therapist uses this image to reduce tension and previously hidden conflicts.\n\n\n"}

The term is a distortion of the French word (feminine form of \"singer\"), and was originally used for female singers that performed opera or operetta arias in \"café-chantant\" venues. As such, the \"sciantosa\" was a sort of scaled-down version of the opera \"diva\". Later on, the term acquired further implications, most notably that of \"femme fatale\". Popular sciantose often had (or pretended to have) mysterious and exotic traits, such as a foreign accent, a turbulent past, or romantic affairs with lovers from the jet set. To emphasize their reputation of divas, prominent sciantose hired a claque to follow their shows.\n\nSome of the most well known sciantose were Anna Fougez, Gilda Mignonette, Olimpia D'Avigny, and Yvonne De Fleuriel. \n\nWith the advent of cinema and television, many forms of popular theatrical shows faded, and so did the \"sciantosa\" archetype, whose traits were partially transferred to new roles such as the soubrette or the showgirl.\n\nThe 1971 film \"La Sciantosa\", by director Alfredo Giannetti, portrays a typical sciantosa (played by Anna Magnani).\n"}

Generally speaking, ritual activities may be distinguished into \"external\" (exoteric) and \"internal\" (esoteric) relatively to the different communities. External ceremonies are mass gatherings, usually held on important holidays dedicated to the worship of common gods, and involving large numbers of people. Internal ceremonies are those restricted to specific groups, and holding special meaning for such groups; they may comprise private rituals and worship of specific ancestors.\n\nLinda J. Ivanits reconstructs a basic calendar of the celebrations of Slavic gods among East Slavs, based on Boris Rybakov's studies on ancient agricultural calendars, especially a fourth-century one found in the area around Kiev.\nAccording to the Rodnover questions–answers compendium \"Izvednik\" (Изведник), almost all Russian Rodnovers rely upon the Gregorian calendar and celebrate the \"sunny holidays\" (highlighted in yellow in the table herebelow), with the addition of holidays dedicated to Perun, Mokosh and Veles (green herebelow), the Red Hill ancestral holiday (orange herebelow), and five further holidays dedicated to ancestors (including Вешние Деды, \"Spring Forefathers\"; Трояцкие Деды, \"Whitsun Forefathers\"; Дмитровские Деды, \"Demetrius Forefathers\"; and Рождественские Деды, \"Christmas Forefathers\", etc.). The contemporary Rodnover calendar is structured as follows:\nYnglism respects eight holidays throughout the year. They are arranged in a \"year's wheel\" (кологод, \"kologod\") and they correspond to the eight major deities of nature. Holidays are called \"thresholds\" (порог, \"porog\") and they mark the beginning of various phases of the year. There are also overarching phases: the phase between the holidays of Koliada and Kupalo is that of the blossoming of males, while the phase between Lelia and Mokosh that of the blossoming of females. The threshold of Perun marks a period of quiescence of forces, while the subsequent Mara is a phase that is unfavourable for both sexes. Each holiday and the period that it begins has appropriate, different ritual actions to be carried out; Ynglists believe that if one behaves incorrectly, his life cycle is disrupted, he becomes unhealthy and quickly grows old.\n\nIn some Slavic languages, such as Russian, the modern names of the months are borrowings from Latin. Otherwise, local traditions and other Slavic languages have preserved Slavic endonyms (endogenous names) for months. Volkhv Aleksey Aleksandrovich Dobroslav has proposed a standardised nomenclature, as reported in the table herebelow. Many Slavic months' names refer to natural phenomena, things and human crafts (for instance, \"Traven\" means \"Grass\"; Bulgarian \"Sukh\" means \"Dry\", etc.).\n\nYnglism has a different structure of time distinguishing it from mainstream Rodnovery. According to Ynglist teachings, the structure of the year is itself a phenomenon reflecting the order of the supreme God, his action which is Yngly. Each month's name may also be written as a compound of two Ynglist runes. Ynglists claim that original Slavic months are nine, instead of twelve, and each month comprises forty or forty-one days. The first rune is either \"Ay\" (Ай), \"Bey\" (Бэй), \"Gey\" (Гэй), \"Day\" (Дай), \"E\" (Э), \"Vey\" (Вэй), \"Xey\" / \"Khey\" (Хей), or \"Tay\" (Тай), reflecting basic sounds in Indo-European tongues and representing the character of the given month. The second rune in the names is always the rune \"Let\" (Летъ), which means \"year\" as well as \"summer\", as months are phases of the year which comes to full maturity in summer. The only exception to this rule is the first month whose name is \"Ramhat\" (Рамхатъ), a term which refers to the beginning of Ramha's ordering action, Yngly, represented by the \"swastika\"-like first rune.\n\n"}

The mission was founded in 1886 by the Jesuits who were welcomed by Bishop Martin Marty, and it soon grew to a large collection of buildings. Most of these were destroyed by a fire in 1916, but many were soon rebuilt. The mission complex includes 26 buildings, the most prominent of which are St. Charles Borromeo Church and the 1916 Drexall Hall, the latter a multifunction structure providing classrooms, meeting spaces, and residential spaces. The complex also includes one of two known copies of a statue of Kateri Tekakwitha by Joseph-Émile Brunet. The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.\n\nThe Jesuit presence in this area goes back to the 1840s when Fr. Peter DeSmet, S.J., was welcomed by the plains Indians and had contacts with the Lakota. Based on his reputation as a man who could be trusted, and on the Jesuit reputation as educators, in 1877 Chief Sinte Gleska (Spotted Tail), leader of the Sicangu Lakota, and Chief Red Cloud, leader of the Oglala, obtained permission from President Rutherford B. Hayes \"to get Catholic priests. Those who wear black dresses. These men will teach us how to read and write English.\" This led to the arrival of a Jesuit Father and brother soon after 1881 and, with financial help from St. Katherine Drexel, the completion of a large building in 1886. In 1888 Franciscan Sisters Kostka, Rosalia, and Alcantara came to teach in the school which they named after St. Francis. Jesuit Fr. Florentine Digmann who had come with the sisters went on to establish 37 mission stations on the Rosebud Reservation. Since 1974 the school, locally called Sapa Un Ti (\"where the Black Robes live\"), has been run by the tribe, independently from the Jesuit mission. The many chapels have been replaced by six parishes on the reservation.\n\nIn 2016 three Jesuit priests along with Jesuit Volunteer Corps members were serving the Mission, with assistance from Lakota – a deacon, several commissioned lay ministers, and numerous volunteers – working among the 20,000 who remain on the reservation. The Mission supports high school equivalency (GED) and adult education, Icimani Ya Waste Recovery Center, the White River Recovery Center, the CYO Religious Education Center in Rosebud, and the Wiwila Wakpala after-school center in Spring Creek, along with the following works at the Center:\n\n"}

{"id": "49082", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49082", "title": "Supermodel", "text": "Supermodel\n\nA supermodel (also spelled super-model and super model) is a highly paid fashion model who usually has a worldwide reputation and often a background in haute couture and commercial modeling. The term \"supermodel\" became prominent in the popular culture of the 1980s and 90s.\n\nSupermodels usually work for prominent fashion designers and clothing brands. They may have multimillion-dollar contracts, endorsements, and campaigns. Supermodels have branded themselves as household names and worldwide recognition is associated with their modeling careers. They have been on the covers of magazines such as French, British, American, and Italian \"Vogue\". Claudia Schiffer stated, \"In order to become a supermodel one must be on all the covers all over the world at the same time so that people can recognise the girls.\"\n\nAn early use of the term \"supermodel\" appeared in 1891 in an interview with artist Henry Stacy Marks for \"The Strand Magazine\", in which Marks told journalist Harry How, \"A good many models are addicted to drink, and, after sitting a while, will suddenly go to sleep. Then I have had what I call the 'super' model. You know the sort of man; he goes in for theatrical effect ...\"\nOn 6 October 1942, a writer named Judith Cass had used the term \"super model\" for her article in the \"Chicago Tribune\", which headlined \"Super Models are Signed for Fashion Show\". Later in 1943, an agent named Clyde Matthew Dessner used the term in a \"how-to\" book about modeling entitled \"So You Want to Be a Model!\" in which Dessner wrote, \"She will be a super-model, but the girl in her will be like the girl in you—quite ordinary, but ambitious and eager for personal development.\" According to \"Model: The Ugly Business of Beautiful Women\" by Michael Gross, the term \"supermodel\" was first used by Dessner. In 1947, anthropologist Harold Sterling Gladwin wrote \"supermodel\" in his book \"Men Out of Asia\". In 1949, the magazine \"Cosmopolitan\" referred to Anita Colby, the highest paid model at the time, as a \"super model\": \"She's been super model, super movie saleswoman, and top brass at Selznick and Paramount.\" On 18 October 1959, Vancouver's \"Chinatown News\" described Susan Chew as a \"super model\".\n\nThe term \"supermodel\" had been used several times in the media in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1965, the encyclopedic guide \"American Jurisprudence Trials\" used the term \"super model\" (\"...at issue was patient's belief that her husband was having an affair with a super model\"). On 21 March 1967, \"The New York Times\" referred to Twiggy as a supermodel; the February 1968 article of \"Glamour\" listed all 19 \"supermodels\"; the Chicago \"Daily Defender\" wrote \"New York Designer Turns Super Model\" in January 1970; \"The Washington Post\" and Mansfield \"News Journal\" used the term in 1971; and in 1974 both the \"Chicago Tribune\" and \"The Advocate\" also used the term \"supermodel\" in their articles. American \"Vogue\" used the term \"super-model\" to describe Jean Shrimpton in the 15 October 1965 edition and \"supermodel\" on the cover page to describe Margaux Hemingway in the 1 September 1975 edition. Hemingway was again described as a 'supermodel' in the 25 July 1977 edition of \"Time\". \"Jet\" also described Beverly Johnson as a \"supermodel\" in the 22 December 1977 edition.\n\nModel Janice Dickinson has incorrectly stated that she coined the term \"supermodel\" in 1979, as a compound of Superman and model. During an interview with \"Entertainment Tonight\", Dickinson stated that her agent Monique Pilar of Elite Model Management asked her, \"Janice, who do you think you are, Superman?\" She replied, \"No ... I'm a supermodel, honey, and you will refer to me as a supermodel and you will start a supermodel division.\" Dickinson also claims to be the first supermodel.\n\nLisa Fonssagrives is widely considered the world's first supermodel. She was in most of the major fashion magazines and general interest magazines from the 1930s to the 1950s, including \"Town & Country\", \"Life\", \"Vogue\", the original \"Vanity Fair\", \"Harper's Bazaar\", and \"Time\". Dorian Leigh has also been called the world's first supermodel, as well as Gia Carangi and Jean Shrimpton.\n\nDutch-born model Wilhelmina Cooper holds the record for most covers on American \"Vogue\", appearing 27 or 28 times throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Cooper would go on to found Wilhelmina Models modeling and talent agency in 1967.\n\nIn February 1968, an article in \"Glamour\" described 19 models as \"supermodels\": Cheryl Tiegs, Veruschka, Lisa Palmer, Peggy Moffitt, Sue Murray, Twiggy, Sunny Harnett, Marisa Berenson, Gretchen Harris, Heide Wiedeck, Irish Bianchi, Hiroko Matsumoto, Anne de Zogheb, Kathy Carpenter, Jean Shrimpton, Jean Patchett, Benedetta Barzini, Claudia Duxbury and Agneta Frieberg.\n\nIn the 1970s, some models became more prominent as their names became more recognizable to the general public. \"Sports Illustrated\" editor Jule Campbell abandoned then-current modeling trends for its fledgling \"Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue\" by photographing \"bigger and healthier\" California models and captioning the photographs with their names, turning many of them into household names and establishing the swimsuit issue as a cornerstone of supermodel status.\n\nIn 1975, Margaux Hemingway landed a then-unprecedented million-dollar contract as the face of Fabergé's Babe perfume and the same year appeared on the cover of \"Time\" magazine, labelled one of the \"New Beauties\", giving further name recognition to fashion models.\n\nLauren Hutton became the first model to receive a huge contract from a cosmetics company and appeared on the cover of \"Vogue\" 26 times. Iman is considered to have been the first supermodel of color.\n\nDonyale Luna was the first black model to appear in British \"Vogue\". Naomi Sims, who is sometimes regarded as the first black supermodel, became the first African American to feature on the cover of \"Ladies' Home Journal\" in 1968. The first African American model to be on the cover of American \"Vogue\" was Beverly Johnson in 1974.\n\nOther notable \"supermodels\" of the time were Beverly Johnson, Cybill Shepherd, Patti Hansen, Penelope Tree, Grace Jones, Janice Dickinson, Pat Cleveland, Rene Russo, Karen Bjornson, Gia Carangi, Jerry Hall, Wilhelmina Cooper, Christie Brinkley, Edie Sedgwick, and Kelly Emberg.\n\nIn October 1981, \"Life\" cited Shelley Hack, Lauren Hutton, and Iman for Revlon, Margaux Hemingway for Fabergé, Karen Graham for Estee Lauder, Cristina Ferrare for Max Factor, and Cheryl Tiegs for CoverGirl by proclaiming them the \"million dollar faces\" of the beauty industry. These models negotiated previously unheard of lucrative and exclusive deals with giant cosmetics companies, were instantly recognizable, and their names became well known to the public.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Inès de La Fressange was the first model to sign an exclusive modeling contract with an haute couture fashion house, Chanel. During the early 1980s, fashion designers began advertising on television and billboards. Catwalk regulars like Gia Carangi, Tiegs, Brinkley, Kim Alexis, Paulina Porizkova, Yasmin Le Bon, Kathy Ireland, Brooke Shields, Carol Alt and Elle Macpherson began to endorse products with their names, as well as their faces, through the marketing of brands such as Diet Pepsi and Ford trucks.\n\nAs the models began to embrace old-style glamour, they were starting to replace film stars as symbols of luxury and wealth. In this regard, supermodels were viewed not so much as individuals but as images.\n\nBy the 1990s, the supermodel became increasingly prominent in the media. The title became tantamount to superstar, to signify a supermodel's fame having risen simply from \"personality.\" Supermodels did talk shows, were cited in gossip columns, partied at the trendiest nightspots, landed movie roles, inspired franchises, dated or married film stars, and earned themselves millions. Fame empowered them to take charge of their careers, to market themselves, and to command higher fees.\n\nThe new era began in 1990, with the era-defining British \"Vogue\" cover of Naomi Campbell, Cindy Crawford, Christy Turlington, Linda Evangelista, and Tatjana Patitz, photographed by Peter Lindbergh which created such an impression on the fashion world that they came to embody the term \"supermodel\". Individually and as an elite group, it seemed as if the idea of \"the supermodel\" had been coined just for them. Each model had gradually attained fame since the mid-1980s and was now among the industry's top stars. Selected by Lindbergh for the January cover of Vogue, the now famous cover inspired singer George Michael to cast the same five models in the music video for his song, \"Freedom! '90\", directed by David Fincher. Other notable photographs capturing this new generation of models, including the famous nude taken by Herb Ritts for Rolling Stone that included Patitz, Crawford, Campbell, Turlington and Stephanie Seymour, helped each supermodel attain worldwide fame and fortune by sharing covers of all the international editions of \"Vogue\", walking the catwalks for the world's top designers, and becoming known by their first names alone.\n\nToday, Campbell, Crawford, Evangelista, Patitz and Turlington are regarded as the \"Original Supermodels.\"\n\nIn 1991, Turlington signed a contract with Maybelline that paid her $800,000 for twelve days' work each year. Four years later, Claudia Schiffer reportedly earned $12 million for her various modeling assignments. Authorities ranging from Karl Lagerfeld to \"Time\" had declared the supermodels more glamorous than movie stars.\n\nCampbell, Evangelista and Turlington became known as \"The Trinity\", a term first used by photographer Steven Meisel and noted by journalist Michael Gross. Evangelista was known as the \"Chameleon\", for her ability to transform her look and reinvent herself. Turlington was known as the \"insurance model\", saying \"clients know that if they hire me, nothing will go wrong\". Campbell was the first black model to appear on the front cover of \"Time\", French \"Vogue\", British \"Vogue\", and the September issue of American \"Vogue\", traditionally the biggest and most important issue of the year.\n\nCampbell, Crawford, Evangelista, Patitz and Turlington were the original group to be regarded as \"The Big Five\" supermodels of the 1990s, The term \"The Big Five\" was later used to describe Campbell, Crawford, Evangelista, Turlington and Claudia Schiffer (replacing Patitz), and with the addition of Kate Moss, they became known as \"the Big Six.\"\n\nIn the 2006 book, \"In Vogue: The Illustrated History of the World's Most Famous Fashion Magazine\" (Rizzoli), the editors cite the \"original supermodels\" and Schiffer when quoting \"Vogue\" Magazine Editor-In-Chief, Anna Wintour, who said, \"Those girls were so fabulous for fashion and totally reflected that time ... [They] were like movie stars.\" The editors name famous models from previous decades, but explain that, \"None of them attained the fame and worldwide renown bestowed on Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington, Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Tatjana Patitz, Stephanie Seymour, Claudia Schiffer, Yasmeen Ghauri, and Karen Mulder in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These models burst out beyond the pages of the magazines. Many became the faces of cosmetics brands and perfumes, had their own television programs and physical-fitness videos and their own lines of lingerie ... Their lives, activities, influences, and images were the subjects of all types of sociological and historical analysis.\" Tyra Banks had begun her career as a model, booking a record-breaking 25 shows in 1991 during her breakout year. She achieved Supermodel status, and rivaled Naomi Campbell as the top Black model in the world.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, the initial era of the supermodel ended and a new era for the supermodel began driven by heroin chic. By the late 1990s, actresses, pop singers, and other entertainment celebrities began gradually replacing models on fashion magazine covers and ad campaigns. The pendulum of limelight left many models in anonymity. A popular \"conspiracy theory\" explaining the supermodel's disappearance is that designers and fashion editors grew weary of the \"I won't get out of bed for less than $10,000 a day\" attitude and made sure no small group of models would ever again have the power of the Big Six.\n\nCharles Gandee, associate editor at \"Vogue\", has said that high prices and poor attitudes contributed less to the decline of the supermodel. As clothes became less flashy, designers turned to models who were less glamorous, so they wouldn't overpower the clothing. Whereas many supermodels of the previous era were American-born, their accents making for an easier transition to stardom, the majority of models began coming from non-English speaking countries and cultures, making the crossover to mainstream spokesperson and cover star difficult. However, the term continued to be applied to notable models such as Kristen McMenamy, Laetitia Casta, Eva Herzigová, Carla Bruni, Tatiana Sorokko, Yasmin Le Bon, Amber Valletta, Shalom Harlow, Nadja Auermann, Helena Christensen, Patricia Velásquez, Adriana Karembeu, Valeria Mazza and later, Milla Jovovich.\n\nEmerging in the late 1990s, Gisele Bündchen became the first in a wave of Brazilian models to gain popularity in the industry and with the public. With numerous covers of \"Vogue\" under her belt, including an issue that dubbed her the \"Return of the \"Sexy\" Model,\" Bündchen was credited with ending the \"heroin chic\" era of models. Following in her footsteps by signing contracts with Victoria's Secret, fellow Brazilians Adriana Lima and Alessandra Ambrosio rose to prominence; however, this \"new trinity\" were unable to cross over into the world of TV, movies and talk shows as easily as their predecessors due to their foreign accents and, apart from Gisele, were often confined to Swimsuit magazines instead of high fashion titles.\n\nSeveral seasons later, they were followed by Eastern Europeans barely into their teens, pale, and \"bordering on anorexic. They were too young to become movie stars or date celebrities; too skeletal to bag Victoria's Secret contracts; and a lack of English didn't bode well for a broad media career\". The opportunities for superstardom were waning in the modeling world, and models like Heidi Klum and Tyra Banks took to television with reality shows like \"Project Runway\" & \"Germany's Next Topmodel\" and \"America's Next Top Model\", respectively, to not only remain relevant but establish themselves as media moguls.\n\nContrary to the fashion industry's celebrity trend of the previous decade, lingerie retailer Victoria's Secret continues to groom and launch young talents into supermodel status, awarding their high-profile \"Angels\" multi-year, multimillion-dollar contracts.\n\nAmerican \"Vogue\" dubbed ten models (Doutzen Kroes, Agyness Deyn, Hilary Rhoda, Raquel Zimmermann, Coco Rocha, Lily Donaldson, Chanel Iman, Sasha Pivovarova, Caroline Trentini and Jessica Stam) as the new crop of supermodels in their May 2007 cover story, while the likes of Christie Brinkley, Christy Turlington, and Linda Evangelista returned to reclaim prominent contracts from celebrities and younger models.\n\nA new generation of models dubbed the \"Instagirls\" (Gigi Hadid, Hailey Baldwin, Bella Hadid, Emily Ratajkowski, Kendall Jenner, Cara Delevingne), have all developed their own unique model-personalities through social media, simply by their number of followers on sites such as Instagram. In today's modeling industry, designers often feature models in campaigns who have a large social media following such as Italian model and actress Monica Bellucci, who gained worldwide recognition whether through films or fashion appearance.\n\nIn addition, the most popular index for model updates and ranking, models.com have declared a new breed of Supers. This include models Cara Delevingne, Karlie Kloss, Kendall Jenner, Gigi Hadid, Natalia Vodianova, Doutzen Kroes, Joan Smalls, Fei Fei Sun, Adriana Lima, Karen Elson, Lara Stone, Miranda Kerr, Liu Wen, Jourdan Dunn, Liya Kebede and Natasha Poly as the New Supers in the fashion industry.\n\nIn the last decade, there has been a new emergence of models known as \"plus-size\" top models, including Robyn Lawley, Crystal Renn, Ashley Graham, Candice Huffine, Tara Lynn, Whitney Thompson, Katya Zharkova, Denise Bidot, Sophie Dahl, Jennie Runk and Natalie Laughlin. These models have been in Catwalks, magazines, and Billboards for brands known worldwide like \"Vogue\", \"Glamour\", Levi’s, Forever 21, Cover Girl cosmetics, Saks Fifth Avenue, GQ Magazine, and Chanel.\n\nIn early 2016, Graham had an overwhelming amount of news coverage worldwide after Sports Illustrated had her on their cover as their first \"Plus-sized\" Top Model in their 2016 swimsuit edition.\n\nIn addition to the models stated previously, a top-grossing part of the industry that tends to be overlooked is the male side of modeling. Though women are predominantly known in the modeling industry, men are used just as frequently in advertisements for clothing, cologne, sports wear and other such accessories.\n\nIn 1993, Italian model Fabio Lanzoni, was the highest paid male model worldwide, getting paid several million dollars a year. He was the male identified individual in many romance novels; he did advertisements for high-end brands like Versace.\nTyson Beckford is known for posing in a number of ads for Ralph Lauren's Polo sport cologne line. Since 1990, he has been the face of Gucci and Tommy Hilfiger, won Model of the year on VH1 Fashion award, and he has also appeared in Calvin Klein's campaign. Another Calvin Klein model is Mark Wahlberg. Many new underwear models in the 30 years later still look to his campaign poses today.\n\nFormer professional football player David Beckham is noted as the Underwear Model of the Century. He has modeled for worldwide ads for H&M, Adidas, Calvin Klein, Burger King, Sainsbury's, and Breitling. British model David Gandy was described as achieving \"icon status\" by ABC News when they featured him on \"Nightline\", stating, \"As the face of Dolce & Gabbana and Lucky Jeans, Gandy is arguably one of the most successful male models ever, but he's a bit modest about that \"supermodel\" title.\"\n\nVogue.com ranked the 'Top 10 Male Models of All Time', the list includes Tyson Beckford, David Gandy, Brad Kroenig, Sean O'Pry, Jon Kortajarena, Marcus Schenkenberg, Mathias Lauridsen, Mark Vanderloo, Noah Mills, and Evandro Soldati.\n\nCritical perception of the supermodel as an industry has been frequent inside and outside the fashion press, from complaints that women desiring this status become unhealthily thin to charges of racism, where the \"supermodel\" generally has to conform to a Northern European standard of beauty in the first decade of the twenty-first century. According to fashion writer Guy Trebay of \"The New York Times\", in 2007, the \"android\" look was popular, a vacant stare and thin body serving, according to some fashion industry conventions, to set off the couture. This had not always been the case. In the 1970s, black, heavier and \"ethnic\" models dominated the runways but social changes in the 1980s to the early 2000s persuaded the power players in the fashion industry to shun suggestions of \"otherness\".\n\nHowever, since the latter part of the first decade of the twenty-first century, an increasing level of diversity has been noted among supermodels catering to the growing East Asian markets, including Japanese model Tao Okamoto and Chinese models Fei Fei Sun and Liu Wen.\n\n\n"}

His father, Cat Toudouze, was a well-known author of the time. The younger Toudouze wrote on such topics as art, architecture, travel and French naval history. Although he penned numerous adventure novels and short stories, he is today remembered for a single work: \"Three Skeleton Key\".\nThe plot involves three men tending a lighthouse on an island off the coast of French Guiana. The rock the lighthouse stands on is dubbed 'Three Skeleton Key', named after a tragedy when three escaped convicts became ship-wrecked on the rock and eventually died of hunger and thirst- the only thing left of them were a heap of bones cleaned off by scavenging birds. The three lighthouse attendants are headkeeper, Itchoua (the eldest of the men), Le Gleo, and the narrator (whose name is never given).\n\nAn abandoned ship, overrun by thousands of ferocious rats, makes landfall. A life-and-death struggle ensues as the men seek to save themselves from the hungry horde, who swarm over the lighthouse. The three men barely manage to survive fending off the rats, who manage to break into the tower. The three escape into the lighthouse gallery, which has a metal trapdoor that the rats cannot gnaw through, and are able to use the light to signal an investigating patrol boat. Eventually, the rats are lured off the island onto a barge loaded with meat, which is then set on fire by incendiary shells; however, Le Gleo has gone insane from the events and is locked away in a French Asylum, and Itchoua dies of infection from rat bites and scratches. The narrator continues to work in the lighthouse until his service time is over.\n\nJames Poe adapted the story for radio in a version that aired on \"Escape\" on November 15, 1949. Poe's script gave different names to the three characters: the narrator is named \"Jean\", the head keeper Itchoua is named \"Louis\" and Le Gleo is now a hunchbacked former actor named \"Auguste\"; the adaptation also provides a different and more chilling reason as to why the rats eventually leave the lighthouse. The 1949 broadcast featured William Conrad as \"Louis\", Harry Bartell as \"Auguste\" and Elliott Reid as \"Jean\". Poe's adaptation was rebroadcast by popular demand in 1950 and 1953, each with a different cast: Vincent Price as \"Jean\", Harry Bartell again as \"Auguste\" and Jeff Corey as \"Louis\" in the March 17, 1950 broadcast; and Paul Frees as \"Louis\", Ben Wright as \"Jean\" and Jay Novello as \"Auguste\" in the August 9, 1953 broadcast. Vincent Price is the actor most associated with the radio play, performing the role of \"Jean\" again in 1956 and 1958 for \"Suspense\". \nThe One Act Audio Theatre revisited \"Three Skeleton Key\" in 2001. A modern recording of the piece can be found at the organization's web site as well as the script by James Poe.\n\nStreaming audio\nShort Film\n"}

{"id": "436607", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=436607", "title": "Visual kei", "text": "Visual kei\n\nSome Western sources consider that visual kei refers to a music genre, with its sound usually related to glam rock, punk rock and heavy metal. However, visual kei acts play various genres, including those considered by some as unrelated to rock such as electronic, pop, etc. Other sources, including members of the movement themselves, state that it is not a music genre and that the freedom of expression, fashion and participation in the related subculture is what exemplifies the use of the term.\n\nThe term \"visual kei\" is credited to Seiichi Hoshiko, the founder editor of \"Shoxx\" magazine, the first publication devoted to the subject. However, he said in an interview with \"Jrock News\" that the term was originally coined, or at least inspired by, X Japan's lead guitarist hide. Hoshiko said: \"At the time, they were called 'Okeshou kei' (makeup style). But it simply felt… too cheap… Even though X Japan was a big band and people used the term 'Okeshou kei' to describe them, the term was still lacking substance, I didn't like the term at all! Because of this, I tried to remind all the writers to not use this term as \"They are not okeshou kei, they are visual-shock kei'. From there, it went from 'Visual-shock kei' to 'Visual-kei' to 'V-kei'. After we spread the word, fans naturally abbreviated it to 'V-kei'. The Japanese love to abbreviate everything as a matter of fact\". Hoshiko considers visual kei as a distinctive music genre and defines it \"as the music itself along with all the visual aspects of it\".\n\nVisual kei emerged in the 1980s underground scene, pioneered by bands such as X Japan, Dead End, Buck-Tick, D'erlanger, and Color. The term \"visual kei\" (the kanji \"kei\" meaning \"system\", \"order\", \"origin\") is believed to come from one of X Japan's slogans, \"Psychedelic Violence-Crime of Visual Shock\", written on the cover of their second studio album \"Blue Blood\" (1989). The movement designated a new form of Japanese rock music influenced by Western hard rock and glam rock-metal acts like David Bowie, Kiss, Twisted Sister, Hanoi Rocks, Mötley Crüe, as well punk-gothic rock influence and it was established in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The movement is roughly divided into two generations, with the first in three transitional eras, of which the first lasted almost a decade.\n\nIn the late 1980s and until the mid-1990s, visual kei received increasing popularity throughout Japan, when album sales from visual kei bands started to reach record numbers. The most notable bands to achieve success during this period included X Japan, Buck-Tick and Luna Sea; however, a drastic change in their appearance accompanied their success. The first band whose recordings achieved a notable success was Dead End, whose independent album \"Dead Line\" (1986) sold over 20,000 copies, while major debut album \"Ghost of Romance\" (1987) released by Victor Entertainment reached No. 14 on the Oricon albums chart. In the same year was released major debut album by Buck Tick, \"Sexual XXXXX!\", through the same record label. Dead End even had two albums released by American label Metal Blade Records, however, Dead End and D'erlanger disbanded in 1990 and from the mid 1988s and 1989s Buck-Tick and X Japan started to gain mainstream success. Buck Tick's single \"Just One More Kiss\" entered Top 10 on the Oricon singles chart, while studio albums \"Seventh Heaven\" (1988) and \"Taboo\" (1989) charted on No. 3 and 1 respectively and were the first Japanese rock band to held a concert at Tokyo Dome. In 1992, X Japan tried to launch an attempt to enter the American market, even signing with Atlantic Records for a US album, but this ultimately did not happen.\n\nTwo record labels, Extasy Records (Tokyo) and Free-Will (Osaka), were instrumental in promoting the visual kei scene. Extasy was created by X Japan's drummer and leader Yoshiki and signed bands, not limited to visual kei acts, that would go on to make marks on the Japanese music scene, including , Tokyo Yankees and Ladies Room. Luna Sea and Glay, who went on to sell millions of records, with Glay being one of Japan's best-selling musical acts, had their first albums released by Extasy in 1991 and 1994. Free-Will was founded by Color vocalist and leader Dynamite Tommy, while at the time not as popular as Extasy, it had many moderately successful acts, such as By-Sexual and Kamaitachi. Currently Free-Will is still going strong and has been a major contributor in spreading modern visual kei inside and outside Japan, whereas Extasy followed its owner and became based out of the US, signing and producing American acts and has since faded away.\n\nThe second transition era began in 1993 by bands such as L'Arc-en-Ciel, Glay (although formed in 1988, their first album was released in 1994) and Malice Mizer. They gained mainstream awareness, although they were not as commercially successful, except for L'Arc-en-Ciel and Glay whose later huge success was also accompanied by a drastic change in their appearance and were often not associated with visual kei. Around 1995 the visual kei bands experienced a booming success in the general population. It lasted four years. Around the early 1990s, a scene later known as Nagoya kei (with more emphasize on music rather than fashion) arouse. Silver-Rose (formed in 1989) and Kuroyume (formed in 1991) were described as \"nagoya big two\" in the underground scene, and with Laputa (formed in 1993), are credited with \"creating the early Nagoya kei style\". The third transition era began by bands such as La'cryma Christi, Penicillin and with moderate success. at the time \"the big four of visual kei bands\" being Malice Mizer, La'cryma Christi, Shazna and Fanatic Crisis back then. During the 1990s emerged several conceptual subgenres like Eroguro kei (notably band Cali Gari), Angura kei (underground style, wearing traditional kimono or Japanese uniform) and Ouji kei or Kodona kei (prince/boy style, notably Plastic Tree). In 1998 Pierrot released their major debut single, and Dir en grey's three major singles were released with the help of Yoshiki in the following year. They were called \"the big two\" in the scene at that time.\n\nBy the late 1990s, the mainstream popularity of visual kei was declining; in 1997 Luna Sea was on a yearly hiatus, X Japan had disbanded and one year later their lead guitarist hide died, in 1999 died Malice Mizer's drummer Kami after departure of singer Gackt, who with toned down make-up solo career became one of the most popular and successful visual-kei singers, L'Arc-en-Ciel publicly distanced themselves from the movement (in 2012 were partly promoted as visual kei rock band), and in 2000, Luna Sea decided to disband as well. In 1998, \"Billboard\"'s Steve McClure commented that \"To a certain extent, hide's death means the end of an era, X were the first generation of visual kei bands, but the novelty has worn off. For the next generation of bands, it's like: \"That's it. The torch has been passed to us\"\". As other bands could not meet financial expectations most major companies backed out of the genre, and it became an underground style often associated with rebellious generation, non-conforming to proper society.\n\nA second generation emerged in visual kei-specific live houses managed by record companies like PS Company (Free-Will) and Maverick DC Group. Notable newer visual kei bands include The Gazette, Nightmare, Alice Nine, An Cafe, Sug, Mucc, D'espairsRay, who have all performed overseas. Veterans of the scene have also established new acts, such as Malice Mizer's Mana with his band Moi dix Mois and three members of Pierrot forming Angelo. In 2007, visual kei was revitalized as Luna Sea performed a one-off performance and X Japan officially reunited with a new single and a world tour. With these developments, visual kei bands enjoyed a boost in public awareness, with bands formed around 2004 having been described by some media as . From this generation emerged subgenre Oshare kei which changed the sound and look of the genre, producing pop-rock type with bright attire.\n\nThe difference between the first and second generation is that the second; has no straightforward music style, ranging from metal to pop, but still seemingly focused on heavy rock genres; the fashion and gender ambiguities are of central importance; although economically not very significant for the Japanese music market, it became the first Japanese genre which succeeded on international scale.\n\nAlthough the first international concert was held in Taiwan by Luna Sea in 1999, only from 2002 the visual kei bands started to perform worldwide (United States, in Europe from 2004), with the initial interest coming from conventions like A-Kon. In the first five years Dir en Grey was especially well received. In 2007 was held first international exclusive festival, Jrock Revolution, in Los Angeles. Although recently some bands like The Gazette played at Tokyo Dome (not in full capacity), the majority of acts play in much smaller venues like Shibuya O-East. In 2009 at Makuhari Messe and 2011 at Saitama Super Arena, was held V-Rock Festival which gathered over 50 visual kei rock bands.\n\nIn 2010, La'cryma Christi(disbanded in 2007) began the tour. Kiyoharu announced the reunions of Kuroyume and Sads, and Luna Sea announced they would reunite on August 31.\n\nOn September 4, 2013, a tribute album, titled \"Dead End Tribute - Song of Lunatics -\", was released. This album features Dead End covers played not by formal bands(except for Boris and cali≠gari), but collaborations between musicians from well-known bands such as Luna Sea, L'Arc-en-Ciel, Kuroyume, La'cryma Christi, Versailles, Janne Da Arc and so on.\n\nAs an epilogue to their 25th anniversary, Luna Sea hosted a rock festival titled Lunatic Fest on 27 and 28 June 2015, with an estimated 60,000 fans attending. Held at Makuhari Messe, there were three stages and 12 artists, with the host band performing twice both nights; once as opening act Lunacy and again as Luna Sea. Other acts included X Japan, Dead End, Dir en grey, Siam Shade and Tokyo Yankees the first night, and Aion, Buck-Tick, D'erlanger, Glay and Mucc the second night.\n\nA visual kei rock festival was held at Makuhari Messe in October 2016, Visual Japan Summit, which was a revival of the Extasy Summit after 24 years. It included X Japan, Luna Sea, Glay and many other music acts.\n\nThere has been criticism directed at newer visual kei bands for having lost the spirit of their forefathers, copying each other in design and sound, becoming all the same. As far back as 1991, Morrie from Dead End was critical of rising imitation among bands. In 1998, Neil Strauss reported that to visual kei bands \"after X\" makeup and outrageous looks became \"more important than music\". Several musicians expressed their discontent; Kirito (Pierrot, Angelo) said \"now it's more like people are dressing up a certain way because they want to be visual kei or look visual kei. They are doing it to look like others instead of doing it to look different. This is obviously very different from when we started out more than ten years ago\", while Sugizo (Luna Sea) that \"they cannot make good sounds and music is more like a hobby for them. I cannot feel their soul in the music\".\n\nAlthough almost from the newer generation himself, Dir en grey bassist Toshiya said in 2010 \"to be honest, when we first started and we were wearing a lot of makeup on stage and stuff, there were a lot of bands doing that at the time in Japan and people thought it was cool\" and added \"the music was so unique, too – bands like X Japan. At that time, there weren't any two bands that sounded alike; these days everyone sounds exactly the same\". Kenzi (Kamaitachi, The Dead Pop Stars, Anti Feminism) commented in 2009 that \"back in the day, there were bands, but people would try to do things differently. Nowadays, there's one band and everyone copies off of them\", with Free-Will founder and Color frontman Tommy concluding with \"I don't think our breed of visual kei exists anymore\". Seiichi Hoshiko in 2018 interview was worried about this trend influence on the movement's future.\n\nVisual kei has enjoyed popularity among independent underground projects, as well as artists achieving mainstream success, with influences from Western phenomena, such as glam, goth and cyberpunk. The music performed encompasses a large variety of genres, i.e. punk, metal, pop and electronica.\n\nMagazines published regularly in Japan with visual kei coverage are \"Arena 37 °C\", \"Cure\", \"Fool's Mate Express\", \"Shoxx\", \"Shock Wave\", \"Rock and Read\" among others. The popularity and awareness of visual kei groups outside Japan has seen an increase in recent years, mostly through internet and Japanese anime, shown for example by German magazines \"Peach\" and \"Koneko\", as well European record label Gan-Shin. The biggest fan communities are found in United States, Germany, Poland, Russia, France and Brazil and to some extent Finland, Chile and Sweden.\n\nFrom these international youth subcultures and influence emerged bands like Cinema Bizarre, but they hesitate to consider themselves as visual kei because are not ethnically Japanese and instead as glam rock. Despite the existence of visually similar music acts, including such as Marilyn Manson, Tokio Hotel and Lady Gaga, in the West the androgynous look of the visual kei bands often has repulsive effect.\n\nAccording to the musicologists, the Lacanist psychoanalysis of the subculture indicate that the fascination to the singer's voice (the lack of understanding amplifies the effect), as well ineffable and unfulfillable desire, are what attracts most of the (predominantly female) fans to the groups on international scale. The female fans (\"bangyaru\") show a behavioral pattern while attending the concerts, as there several \"furi\" (movements) like \"tesensu\" (arm fan), \"gyakudai\" (reversed dive), \"hedoban\" (headbang), \"saku\" (spread hands in the air). The explicit fan fiction and homoerotic acts on the stage by some musicians called \"fan sabisu\" (fan service; a sexual term borrowed from manga culture), are related to the Lacanian man's type of desire (to be recognized by the other, desire of the other), i.e. the female fans do not desire the musician himself, but his desire, kind of cultural social training ground for the inescapable process of learning how to desire.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1354657", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1354657", "title": "Émile Bernard", "text": "Émile Bernard\n\nÉmile Henri Bernard (28 April 1868 – 16 April 1941) was a French Post-Impressionist painter and writer, who had artistic friendships with Vincent van Gogh, Paul Gauguin and Eugène Boch, and at a later time, Paul Cézanne. Most of his notable work was accomplished at a young age, in the years 1886 through 1897. He is also associated with Cloisonnism and Synthetism, two late 19th-century art movements. Less known is Bernard's literary work, comprising plays, poetry, and art criticism as well as art historical statements that contain first-hand information on the crucial period of modern art to which Bernard had contributed.\n\nÉmile Henri Bernard was born in Lille, France in 1868. As in his younger years his sister was sick, Émile was unable to receive much attention from his parents; he therefore stayed with his grandmother, who owned a laundry in Lille, employing more than twenty people. She was one of the greatest supporters of his art. The family moved to Paris in 1878, where Émile attended the \"Collège Sainte-Barbe.\"\n\nHe began his studies at the École des Arts Décoratifs. In 1884, joined the Atelier Cormon where he experimented with impressionism and pointillism and befriended fellow artists Louis Anquetin and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. After being suspended from the École des Beaux-Arts for \"showing expressive tendencies in his paintings\", he toured Brittany on foot, where he was enamored by the tradition and landscape.\n\nIn August 1886, Bernard met Gauguin in Pont-Aven. In this brief meeting, they exchanged little about art, but looked forward to meeting again. Bernard said, looking back on that time, that \"my own talent was already fully developed.\" He believed that his style did play a considerable part in the development of Gauguin's mature style.\n\nBernard spent September 1887 at the coast, where he painted \"La Grandmère\", a portrait of his grandmother. He continued talking with other painters and started saying good things about Gauguin. Bernard went back to Paris, attended Académie Julian, met with van Gogh, who as we already stated was impressed by his work, found a restaurant to show the work alongside van Gogh, Anquetin, and Toulouse-Lautrec's work at the Avenue Clichy. Van Gogh called the group the School of Petit-Boulevard.\n\nOne year later, Bernard set out for Pont-Aven by foot and saw Gauguin. Their friendship and artistic relationship grew strong quickly. By this time Bernard had developed many theories about his artwork and what he wanted it to be. He stated that he had \"a desire to [find] an art that would be of the most extreme simplicity and that would be accessible to all, so as not to practice its individuality, but collectively...\" Gauguin was impressed by Bernard's ability to verbalize his ideas.\n\n1888 was a seminal year in the history of Modern art. From 23 October until 23 December Paul Gauguin and Vincent van Gogh worked together in Arles. Gauguin had brought his new style from Pont-Aven exemplified in \"Vision after the Sermon: Jacob Wrestling with the Angel\", a powerful work of visual symbolism of which he had already sent a sketch to van Gogh in September.\n\nHe also brought along Bernard's \"Le Pardon de Pont-Aven\" which he had exchanged for one of his paintings and which he used to decorate the shared workshop.\nsee in: (ref. Druick 2001) This work was equally striking and illustrative of the style Émile Bernard had already acquainted van Gogh with when he sent him a batch of drawings in August, so much so that van Gogh made a watercolor copy of the \"Pardon\" (December 1888) which he sent to his brother, to recommend Bernard's new style to be promoted. The following year van Gogh still vividly remembered the painting in his written portrait of Émile Bernard in a letter to his sister Wil (10 December 1889):\"...it was so original I absolutely wanted to have a copy.\"\n\nBernard's style was effective and coherent (see:woman at haystacks,) as can also be seen from the comparison of the two \"portraits\" Bernard and Gauguin sent to van Gogh at the end of September 1888 at the latter's request: self-portraits -at Gauguin's initiative- each integrating a small portrait of the other in the background. (ref. Druick 2001)\n\nOne of Émile Bernard's drawings from the August batch (\"...a lane of trees near the sea with two women talking in the foreground and some strollers\" – Vincent van Gogh in a letter to Bernard – Arles 1888) also appears to have inspired the work van Gogh and Gauguin did on the Allée des Alyscamps in Arles.\n\nIn 1891 he joined a group of Symbolist painters that included Odilon Redon and Ferdinand Hodler. In 1893 he started traveling, to Egypt, Spain and Italy and after that his style became more eclectic. He returned to Paris in 1904 and remained there for the remainder of his life. He taught at the École des Beaux-Arts before he died in 1941.\n\nBernard theorized a style of painting with bold forms separated by dark contours which became known as cloisonnism. His work showed geometric tendencies which hinted at influences of Paul Cézanne, and he collaborated with Paul Gauguin and Vincent van Gogh.\n\nMany say that it was Bernard's friend Anquetin, who should receive the credit for this \"closisonisme\" technique. During the spring of 1887, Bernard and Anquetin \"turned against Neo-Impressionism.\" It is also likely that Bernard was influenced by the works he had seen of Cézanne. But Bernard says \"When I was in Brittany, I was inspired by \"everything that is superfluous in a spectacle is covering it with reality and occupying our eyes instead of our mind. You have to simplify the spectacle in order to make some sense of it. You have, in a way, to draw its plan.\" \n\n\"The first means that I use is to simplify nature to an extreme point. I reduce the lines only to the main contrasts and I reduce the colors to the seven fundamental colors of the prism. To see a style and not an item. To highlight the abstract sense and not the objective.\nAnd the second means were to appeal to the conception and to the memory by extracting yourself from any direct atmosphere. Appeal more to internal memory and conception. There I was expressing myself more, it was me that I was describing, although I was in front of the nature. There was an invisible meaning under the mute shape of exteriority.\"\n\nSymbolism and religious motifs appear in both Bernard and Gauguin's work. During the summer of 1889, Bernard was alone in Le Pouldu and began to paint many religious canvasses. He was upset that he had to do commercial work at the same time that he wanted to create these pieces.\nBernard wrote about his relationship with the style of symbolism in many letters, articles, and statements. He said that it was of a Christian essence, divine language. Bernard believed that it \"It is the invisible express by the visible,\" and those previous attempts of religious symbolism failed. That period of symbolism represented the nature of beauty, but did not find the truth in the beauty. Art until the renaissance was based on the invisible rather than the visible, the idea, not the shapes or concrete. The history of the painting of symbols was spiritual. Everything, meaning symbols, were forgotten with the paganist ideas and doctrines. That is what Bernard was attempting to accomplish with the rebirth of symbolism in 1890. In his idea of the new symbolism, he concentrated on maintaining a grounded art, more authentic in Bernard's mind meant reducing impressionism, not creating an optical trip like Georges-Pierre Seurat, but simplifying the actual symbol.\n\nHis concept was that through ideas, not technique, the truth is found.\n\nIt was always Émile Bernard's great frustration that Paul Gauguin never mentioned him as an influence on pictorial symbolism (see for instance his own notes attached to the Belgian edition (1942) of his selected letters, published shortly after his death). In 2001/2002 The Art Institute of Chicago and the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam held a joint exhibition:Van Gogh and Gauguin:The Workshop of the South that put Émile Bernard's contribution in perspective. (ref. Druick 2001)\n\nOne of Émile Bernard's students was the Swedish painter Ivan Aguéli.\n\n\nHis correspondence with other artists is of great art historical interest. Van Gogh, Gauguin, and Bernard traded ideas and art. Many letters sent from van Gogh and Gauguin to Bernard give historians a better idea of the artists lives and connection to their artwork.\n\n\n\n"}
