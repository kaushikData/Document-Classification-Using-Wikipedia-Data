Frequently, a board of directors power with a larger institution, such as a higher government's department of education. The name of such board is also often used to refer to the school system under such board's control.\n\nThe government department that administered education in the United Kingdom before the foundation of the Ministry of Education was formerly called the Board of Education.\n\nThe American board of education traces its origins back to 1647, with the formation of the first American public school system, the Massachusetts Bay Colony mandated that every town establish a public school within its jurisdiction. Committees sprang up to run the institutions, and in the 1820s the state of Massachusetts required such committees to be independent of local governments, establishing the current model for the autonomous school districts that exist throughout the United States. The United States Constitution reserved educational authority in the hands of the states pursuant to the Tenth Amendment, wherein most states have passed such authority to local school boards. For over a century, local boards were solely responsible for public education funding, standards, instruction, and results, which to a certain extent remains true today. At their height in the 1930s there were as many as 127,500 boards. Some sparsely populated states had more school board members than teachers and for much of their history, such boards presided over school systems serving agrarian and industrial economies.\n\n"}

{"id": "75210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=75210", "title": "Bottom (TV series)", "text": "Bottom (TV series)\n\nBottom is a British TV sitcom created by Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall that originally aired on BBC2 from 17 September 1991 to 10 April 1995 across three series. The show stars Edmondson and Mayall as Edward Elizabeth \"Eddie\" Hitler and Richard \"Richie\" Richard, two flatmates who live in Hammersmith, West London. The show is noted for its chaotic, nihilistic humour and violent comedy slapstick.\n\n\"Bottom\" also spawned five stage-show tours between 1993 and 2003, and a feature film, \"Guest House Paradiso\" (1999). Plans for a spin-off series titled \"Hooligan's Island\" featuring various \"Bottom\" characters were cancelled in 2012. In 2004, \"Bottom\" came in at No. 45 in the \"Britain's Best Sitcom\" poll by the BBC.\n\n\n\nEddie and Richie are two pathetic, misogynistic, slobby flatmates living in a filthy, damp flat at 11 Mafeking Parade in Hammersmith, London. Mayall described them as \"unemployed survivors\". They spend their time concocting desperate schemes to convince women to have sex with them, including buying sex spray, forging money, and pretending to be aristocrats. Their plans are never successful however, and the stress of their miserable lives can cause them to become irritable with each other. Whenever tensions hit breaking point, Richie and Eddie end up fighting (albeit in a comical, Tom and Jerry-style, with adult themes). Both men are immature. Richie is a virgin; he is insecure and clueless on how to talk to women. Despite being a penniless slob, he occasionally projects a pompous sort of snobbery in an attempt to impress others and boost his self-esteem; he is sexually frustrated and obsessed with losing his virginity. Eddie, the more popular of the two, enjoys drinking regularly, and often secretly steals family heirlooms and cash from Richie, although he occasionally has inventive moments, like building a cash forger, an electric toilet, and a time machine. Eddie's friends — the gormless Spudgun and Dave Hedgehog — both fear Richie, believing him to be psychotic. Although the four of them sometimes venture out, usually to the local pub, the Lamb and Flag, most of the episodes are set within the confines of the squalid flat.\n\nAdrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall had been a double act since their first meeting at 20th Century Coyote, while they were students at Manchester University in 1976. They developed the Eddie and Richie characters over the course of their career, which were loosely based on their own friendship. The names themselves come from Edmondson's and Mayall's own nicknames for each other; many of Mayall's characters are referred to by some variation of the name Richard, and Edmondson's character is taken from Eddie Monsoon, his nickname since university. The duo used their characters similar to Eddie and Richie in their past television comedy shows \"The Young Ones\", \"The Dangerous Brothers\", and \"Filthy, Rich & Catflap\".\n\n\"Bottom\" was developed while Edmondson and Mayall planned their West End production of Samuel Beckett's play \"Waiting for Godot\" at the Queen's Theatre. According to Mayall, it was the first project that the two wrote in \"some time\", and it was their best work, marking \"a new chapter in their relationship\". The title was initially as a joke, and originally intended to be \"Your Bottom\", giving viewers the fun of saying things like \"I saw Your Bottom last night\", and \"I love Your Bottom\"; Mayall said that Alan Yentob, then head of BBC2, took a dislike to the name and so he and Edmondson went with it. He added, \"It's about two guys at the bottom of the heap ... we called it \"Bottom\" to make people think we were doing bottom jokes\". \"It's rude, stupid, and a waste of license payers' money\".\n\nEach episode was filmed in front of a live audience at 35 minutes in length, then edited to 30 minutes. The original-length scripts can be found in the published script books, and several completely removed scenes were included in the VHS release \"Fluff\" that consisted mostly of bloopers. Several (but not all) of these scenes, as well as some smaller sections of dialogue also removed for timing reasons, are included in DVD releases.\n\nThe final episode of the second series, \"'s Out\", was not broadcast as part of the original series, or as a part of the first repeat airing of the series. This episode was set on Wimbledon Common involving the antics of a flasher, and prior to broadcast on 15 July 1992, after the episode was filmed but before it had aired, Rachel Nickell was murdered on Wimbledon Common. In consequence the BBC delayed the episode's broadcast before the VHS release of the second series. The episode was first broadcast as part of a rerun of the second series on 10 April 1995.\n\nFollowing the second series, Edmondson and Mayall pursued other projects, including the \"Bottom\" theatrical productions. They reconvened in 1994 to film the third series. A fourth series was written but turned down by the BBC.\n\nThough the pair were working apart, a fourth series was at one point written, but the BBC declined the script, despite announcing that \"Bottom\" would return in a voice-over during the end-credits of the original broadcast of the final episode. (Mayall had commented, in typical style, that it was \"rejected by some lesbian bitch\"). Edmondson had, however, stated in interviews that he would have liked to make another series of \"Bottom\" with Mayall, but \"in about fifteen years' time, when they are old men\". Rik Mayall maintained that they would work together, they just needed \"a good idea\".\n\nHowever, in December 2004, almost exactly a year after the \"Weapons Grade Y-Fronts\" tour had ended, Edmondson told the British \"Daily Mirror\" newspaper that the pair felt it was \"[...] definitely time to stop. We're both getting too old. We both realised that the show wasn't as engaging as it used to be. We were starting to look a bit ridiculous. [...] We're both nearly fifty and we're starting to feel slightly undignified talking about wanking and knobs constantly.\" In April 2010, Edmondson confirmed to the \"Daily Express\" that he had quit comedy, stating that his interest in it has declined for many years, and wanted to focus more on his band, claiming it is 'more fun than doing comedy.' He also dismissed the idea of a potential reunion with Mayall, saying it is 'very unlikely'.\n\nHowever, on 5 March 2011, the duo made a surprise reunion when Edmondson partook in \"Let's Dance for Comic Relief\". The pre-recorded show ended with Mayall hurling a custard pie in Edmondson's face. During his performance, dubbed \"The Dying Swan,\" Mayall appeared again, this time live on stage, to abruptly end Edmondson's performance by hitting him several times with a frying pan. Backstage, Edmondson mentioned that it had been eight years since they've \"done anything like that.\" He went on to come out on top of the voting results and won a place in the final, in which Mayall returned, once again, to drop a ton weight upon Edmondson.\n\nFollowing this, Edmondson mentioned that he and Mayall had conceived an idea for a sitcom set in a retirement home:\nIn September 2011, Edmondson appeared on the Sunday-morning cooking show \"Something for the Weekend\" and confirmed to presenter Tim Lovejoy that he and Mayall were planning to reunite and make another series of \"Bottom\", set in a retirement home. However, no specific dates were stated regarding the project.\n\nOn 19 August 2012, Edmondson tweeted that he and Mayall had begun writing a new project together, possibly a series based on their 1997 stage show, \"\". On 23 August the BBC announced that they had commissioned a series of \"Hooligan's Island\" to be aired on BBC2 in 2013. However, the project was cancelled that October prior to production as Edmondson said that he wished to pursue other interests.\n\nEdmondson and Mayall toured \"Bottom\" across five UK tours. The first tour, \"Bottom Live\", lasted 43 dates across 10 weeks in 1993. The stage shows were often cruder than the television series with stronger language and new elements such as Richie's latent bisexuality and occasional desire to have sex with Eddie, such is Richie's desperation to have sex with anything. A show from each tour was recorded and released for home video.\n\nFollowing the 1997 \"Hooligan's Island\" tour, Mayall and Edmondson wrote a spin-off movie together, which Edmondson directed, entitled \"Guest House Paradiso\", released in 1999. The DVD release was advertised as the \"\"Bottom\" movie\", although this had been denied on its cinema release, as in 1999's interview on UK breakfast show \"The Big Breakfast\", the week prior to its British cinema release. Nevertheless, despite the characters being given new surnames ('Richard Twat' - which he insists is pronounced 'Thwaite' - and 'Eddie Elizabeth Ndingobamba'), they are effectively the same characters, transposed to the situation of running a grotty remote guest house next to a nuclear power plant. The style of humour is very much in the same vein as \"Bottom\", with a storyline of the pair feeding guests radioactive fish, causing massive amounts of vomiting.\n\nNote: The episodes' names are meant to be a suffix to the word \"bottom\".\n\n'*' = Episodes featuring only the two main characters\n<br>'+' = Episodes where no part of the episode is set in the flat\n\nIn Australia, Bottom: Series One Episodes 1-3 (Comedy Bites) was released on 4 March 2010.\n\nDVD releases of Bottom have an audio edit made to the fourth episode of the first series, Apocalypse. At the funfair when Richie realises that his wallet is missing, he originally called the fair staff \"thieving bastard gyppos\". In the DVD releases the word 'gyppos' has been replaced with 'yobbos'.\n\n\n"}

These language varieties form the central part of the Indo-Aryan languages family, itself a part of the Indo-European languages family. They historically form a dialect continuum that descends from the Madhya Prakrits. Located in the Hindi Belt, the Hindi language varieties also includes the Khariboli dialect, the primary dialect spoken in Delhi and the basis of modern Hindi and Urdu. This dialect developed over centuries into the medieval Hindustani language, of which Modern Standard Hindi and Modern Standard Urdu are today derived from. Both Hindi and Urdu are standardizations of the Hindustani language that was historically spoken in Delhi and used as a lingua franca across Northern India. In regards to the Indo-Aryan language family, the coherence of this language group depends on the classification being used; here only Eastern and Western Hindi will be considered.\n\nIf there can be considered a consensus within the dialectology of Hindi proper, it is that it can be split into two sets of dialects: \"Western\" and \"Eastern Hindi\". \"Western Hindi\" evolved from the Apabhramsa form of Shauraseni Prakrit, \"Eastern Hindi\" from \"Ardhamagadhi\".\n\nThis analysis excludes varieties sometimes claimed for Hindi for cultural reasons, such as Bihari, Rajasthani, and Pahari.

Characterisation tends to be defined only vaguely and the plot gives the illusion of dynamic, constant movement. The German philosopher Hegel argued that characters pursue their aims in such comedies via the use of deception. The genre was first developed in the theatre of classical Rome by Plautus and Terence. Examples of comedies of intrigue include Niccolò Machiavelli's \"The Mandrake\" (1524), the anonymous Italian play \"The Deceived Ones\" (1531), Shakespeare's \"The Merchant of Venice\" (c. 1596) and \"Much Ado About Nothing\", Thomas Heywood's \"The Wise Woman of Hoxton\" (c. 1604), Molière's \"Scapin the Schemer\" (1671), and the plays of Aphra Behn and Thomas D'Urfey.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "74553", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74553", "title": "Dermatology", "text": "Dermatology\n\nDermatology (from ancient Greek δέρμα, \"derma\" which means skin and λογία, \"logia\") is the branch of medicine dealing with the skin, nails, hair and its diseases. It is a specialty with both medical and surgical aspects. A dermatologist is a doctor that treats diseases, in the widest sense, and some cosmetic problems of the skin, scalp, hair, and nails.\n\nAttested in English in 1819, the word \"dermatology\" derives from the Greek δέρματος (\"dermatos\"), genitive of δέρμα (\"derma\"), \"skin\" (itself from δέρω \"dero\", \"to flay\") and -λογία \"-logia\".\n\nReadily visible alterations of the skin surface have been recognized since the dawn of history, with some being treated, and some not. In 1801 the first great school of dermatology became a reality at the famous Hôpital Saint-Louis in Paris, while the first textbooks (Willan's, 1798–1808) and atlases (Alibert's, 1806–1814) appeared in print during the same period of time.\n\nAfter earning a medical degree (M.D. or D.O.), the length of training in the United States for a general dermatologist to be eligible for Board Certification by the American Academy of Dermatology, American Board of Dermatology or the American Osteopathic Board of Dermatology is a total of four years. This training consists of an initial medical, transitional, surgical, or pediatric intern year followed by a three-year dermatology residency. Following this training, one- or two- year post-residency fellowships are available in immunodermatology, phototherapy, laser medicine, Mohs micrographic surgery, cosmetic surgery, dermatopathology, or pediatric dermatology. For the past several years, dermatology residency positions in the United States have been one of the most competitive to obtain.\n\nIn the UK, a dermatologist is a medically qualified practitioner who has gone on to specialize in medicine and then sub-specialize in dermatology. This involves:\n\n\nUpon successful completion of the four-year training period, the doctor becomes an accredited dermatologist and is able to apply for a consultant hospital post as a consultant dermatologist.\n\nDermatologists have been leaders in the field of cosmetic surgery. Some dermatologists complete fellowships in surgical dermatology. Many are trained in their residency on the use of botulinum toxin, fillers, and laser surgery. Some dermatologists perform cosmetic procedures including liposuction, blepharoplasty, and face lifts. Most dermatologists limit their cosmetic practice to minimally invasive procedures. Despite an absence of formal guidelines from the American Board of Dermatology, many cosmetic fellowships are offered in both surgery and laser medicine.\n\nA dermatolopathologist is a pathologist or dermatologist who specializes in the pathology of the skin. This field is shared by dermatologists and pathologists. Usually a dermatologist or pathologist will complete one year of dermatopathology fellowship. This usually includes six months of general pathology, and six months of dermatopathology. Alumni of both specialties can qualify as dermatopathologists. At the completion of a standard residency in dermatology, many dermatologists are also competent at dermatopathology. Some dermatopathologists qualify to sit for their examinations by completing a residency in dermatology and one in pathology.\n\nThis field specializes in the treatment of immune-mediated skin diseases such as lupus, bullous pemphigoid, pemphigus vulgaris, and other immune-mediated skin disorders. Specialists in this field often run their own immunopathology labs.Immunodermatology testing is essential for the correct diagnosis and treatment of many diseases affecting epithelial organs including skin, mucous membranes, gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts.The various diseases often overlap in clinical and histological presentation and, although the diseases themselves are not common, may present with features of common skin disorders such as urticaria, eczema and chronic itch. Therefore, the diagnosis of an immunodermatological disease is often delayed.Tests are performed on blood and tissues that are sent to various laboratories from medical facilities and referring physicians across the United States.\n\nThe dermatologic subspecialty called Mohs surgery focuses on the excision of skin cancers using a tissue-sparing technique that allows intraoperative assessment of 100% of the peripheral and deep tumor margins developed in the 1930s by Dr. Frederic E. Mohs. The procedure is defined as a type of CCPDMA processing. Physicians trained in this technique must be comfortable with both pathology and surgery, and dermatologists receive extensive training in both during their residency. Physicians who perform Mohs surgery can receive training in this specialized technique during their dermatology residency, but many will seek additional training either through preceptorships to join the American Society for Mohs Surgery or through formal one to two years Mohs surgery fellowship training programs administered by the American College of Mohs Surgery.\n\nThis technique requires the integration of the same doctor in two different capacities: surgeon as well as pathologist. In case either of the two responsibilities is assigned to another doctor or qualified health care professional, it will not be considered to be Mohs surgery.\n\nPhysicians can qualify for this specialization by completing both a pediatric residency and a dermatology residency. Or they might elect to complete a post-residency fellowship. This field encompasses the complex diseases of the neonates, hereditary skin diseases or genodermatoses, and the many difficulties of working with the pediatric population.\n\nTeledermatology is a form of dermatology where telecommunication technologies are used to exchange medical information via all kinds of media (audio, visual and also data communication, but typically photos of dermatologic conditions) usually made by non-dermatologists for evaluation off-site by dermatologists).\nThis subspecialty deals with options to view skin conditions over a large distance to provide knowledge exchange, to establish second-opinion services for experts or to use this for follow-up of individuals with chronic skin conditions. Teledermatology can reduce wait times by allowing dermatologists to treat minor conditions online while serious conditions requiring immediate care are given priority for appointments.\n\nDermatoepidemiology is the study of skin disease at the population level. One aspect of dermatoepidemiology is the determination of the global burden of skin diseases \nFrom 1990 to 2013, skin disease constituted approximately 2% of total global disease disability as measured in disability adjusted life years (DALYS).\n\nTherapies provided by dermatologists include, but are not restricted to the following:\n\nMost dermatologic pharmacology can be categorized based on the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System, specifically the ATC code D.\n"}
{"id": "41942657", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41942657", "title": "Digital addict", "text": "Digital addict\n\nDigital addict is used to refer to a person who compulsively uses digital technology, which would manifest as another form of addiction if that technology was not as easily accessible to them. Colloquially, it can be used to describe a person whose interaction with technology is verging on excessive, threatening to absorb their attention above all else and consequently having a negative impact on the well-being of the user.\n\nThe primary theory is digital technology users develop digital addiction by their habitual use and reward from computer applications. This reward triggers the reward center in the brain that releases more dopamine, opiates, and neurochemicals, which over time can produce a stimulation tolerance or need to increase stimulation to achieve a “high” and prevent withdrawal.\n\nUsed as a conversational phrase, digital addict describes an increasingly common dependence on devices in the digital age.\n\nFounded in current research on the adverse consequences of overusing technology, digital addict is used as an overarching phrase to suggest an increasing trend of compulsive behaviour amongst users of technological devices, recognising that over-exposure to and over-use of technology can result in a dependence on digital devices, leading to behavioural symptoms similar to any addictive disorder, as the user neglects to maintain a healthy balance between using technology and socialising outside of it. \nThe negative side-effects of overusing technology have in recent decades attracted increasing attention as a legitimate psychological disorder. Unrestrained use of technological devices may impact upon developmental, social, mental and physical well-being and result in symptoms akin to other behavioural addiction. Several clinics worldwide now offer treatment for internet addiction disorder, and several studies have sought to establish a connection between the use of the internet and patterns of behaviour Whilst not yet listed as a legitimate mental health disorder within the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" published by the American Psychiatric Association, in the 2013 edition (DSM-V) internet addiction disorder was recommended for further study within an appendix of the manual, demonstrating the addictive qualities of technology as warranting further medical and academic research.\n\nIt is clear that, whilst still debated, the potential for internet or digital devices to have addictive qualities is an emerging concern. In recent years particular attention has been paid to how the over-use of technology may be affecting the younger generation. With an influx of technology designed for day-to-day use, many children are becoming increasingly reliant upon digital devices for education, social networking and entertainment. With young people spending less time interacting with their peers face to face and more time indoors than previous generations, the direct impact of digital devices on both physical and mental well-being is becoming of concern. The potential developmental side-effects of internet use are also recognised by the American Academy of Paediatrics in children under two years of age. Furthermore, South Korea's concern for the attachment its younger generation has to technology is even greater, with their parliament considering passing a law to curb obsessive game use within the country by classifying online gaming as a potentially anti-social addiction.\n\nWhether by academics, medics, journalists or users themselves, concerns are voiced worldwide about the potentially addictive qualities of technology, building a legitimate case for considering digital addict a valid social descriptor, aptly describing a collective trend in media habits. Although the extent to which digital addiction can be considered of medical interest continues to be discussed, the recognition of technology overuse as a developing cultural and social issue remains important.\n\nThe phrase has been used informally amongst some internet users and bloggers, one of the earliest uses being in 2009 in an article by Rupinder Gill on the popular blog SparkLife.\n\nThe term was then independently adopted and promoted by Stephen Dilworth MD Member Network UK for Foresters, the international financial services organisation. Foresters defined, developed and applied the term digital addict to substantiate use of the phrase within discussion on the potential danger in being over-exposed to technology. The term has been used in several published resources, first appearing in its commercial use between October – December 2013.\n\nThe phrase has been used significantly, and persuasively, as part of the Tech Timeout campaign an international initiative encouraging families to consider how reliant they are upon the devices within their home by taking an hour out of their day to spend away from technology and instead spend that time as a family. The Tech Timeout campaign was devised to negotiate the growing issue of technology addiction and addresses the importance of moderating our use of digital technologies so as not to become dependent upon them. Digital addict is used within this context to hint at the growing obsession with digital devices, and although an informal descriptor, it is used from a position of concern for the growing dependence upon technology in wider society and within the home.\n\nBorn of the recognition that the acceptance of technology in the modern world has hidden the extent to which populations are becoming reliant upon, and over-attached to, digital devices 'digital addict' offers a collective term to recognise the increasing amount of time dedicated to using internet or digital devices in contemporary society.\n\nThe digital divide has led to the development of many phrases seeking to define trends in behavioural use of technology and patterns of behaviour, ranging from digital native to digital detox to digital omnivore, all recognising the prevalence of technology in our lives. Digital addict fits within this discourse and begins to consider the psychological effects of internet use and the impact this has upon mental, social and even physical well-being.\n\nStudies have shown that children’s technology use has greatly increased over the past two decades. As of 2015, children as young as one year of age are using technology, such as tablets, iPhones, and computers. Although these devices can be a good learning tool as it teaches children how to use these technologies, it can also harm them in various ways. Researchers have found that the use of these devices can cause or contribute to child obesity because children spend so much time on their devices. It is also common for these children suffer pain because they are looking at their screens for long period of time. Moreover, children in the future may experience having poorer muscle tone because of being hunched over while using the devices. \n\nWith increased time spent in front of the screen, children spend less time playing sports, exercising or participating in other activities, such as reading or engaging with other children. This is not only having a physical effect, but it also is affecting the children’s social development. Face-to-face interactions are highly crucial in a child’s development so that they can learn social and communication skills but increased technology time limits this and can impede learning. The time spent on screen can make young children suffer by affecting their learning abilities in a detrimental way. Children can learn and retain information better in person than from a screen between the ages of 12–18 months. A specific term called \"video deficit\" occurs when an infant learns better from a live presentation than from a video presentation. There has been multiple studies that showed children between the ages of 12–36 months who learn how to imitate and solve problems more adequately when they observe an in person demonstration versus when watching it from a video screen. Because of the technological age that children are growing up in, this is becoming an increasing problem due to its accessibility to children but taking away digital devices would also have a detrimental effect. \n\nAlthough there are many significant sources claiming that the negatives outweigh the positives in children’s technology use, it should also be noted that effects of prosocial video game play have been correlated with a child’s ability to feel empathy making them more inclined to help others according to Greitmeyer & Osswald in a 2010 study. The use of technology by children can also contribute to the overall improvements of motor skills. By playing interactive games and knowing how to navigate through a screen using buttons, children are able to learn how to coordinate their brains with their fingers.\n\n"}

Shields may be divided this way for \"differencing\" (to avoid conflict with otherwise similar coats of arms) or for purposes of \"marshalling\" (combining two or more coats of arms into one), or simply for style. The lines that divide a shield may not always be straight, and there is a system of terminology for describing patterned lines, which is also shared with the heraldic ordinaries. French heraldry takes a different approach in many cases from the one described in this article.\n\nCommon partitions of the field are:\n\n(In the above \"left\" and \"right\" are from the viewer's perspective, whereas the heraldic terms \"sinister\" and \"dexter\" are from the perspective of the person carrying the shield.)

A chief is considered a charge in English heraldry and is considered layered atop the field.\n\nShields may also be divided into three parts: this is called \"tierced\", as in \"tierced per pale, azure, argent and gules\" (though perhaps in English heraldry this is rarely if ever done, and the foregoing shield would be blazoned — as the pale is supposed to be one-third of the width of the field and is always so depicted under these circumstances — \"per pale azure and gules, a pale argent.\" but Scottish heraldry does use 'tierced in pale' (e.g. Clackmannan county (now Clackmannanshire) has \"Or; a saltire gules; a chief tierced in pale vert, argent, vert ...\") A particular type of tiercing, resembling a Y in shape (division lines per bend and bend sinister coming down from the chief, meeting at the fess point, and continuing down per pale), is called \"per pall\" (also \"per pairle\"). The arms of Pope Benedict XVI is \"tierced in mantle\" - as described in Vatican information pages, but the usual term in, for example South African heraldry, is \"chapé ployé\" (with arched lines, with straight lines: \"chapé\" (mantled)), which may be blazoned with three tinctures or just two - e.g. Okakarara Technical Institute: \"Gules, chapé Azure, on the partition lines respectively a bend and a bend sinister enhanced, in base a demi-cogwheel, Or, with a fountain issuant.\" Shields may also be divided into three parts by a combination of two methods of division, such as \"party per fess, in chief per pale\". Another example is in the arms of Clive Cheesman: \"per pale and per pall\". This is to be distinguished from the essentially unique partition in the arms of the 2nd Weather Group of the United States Air Force, which is \"Dexter per chevron ployé and sinister per fess enhanced\".\n\nA shield may also be \"party per chevron reversed (inverted)\", which is like party per chevron except upside down. A section formed by two (straight) lines drawn from the corners of the chief to the point in base is called \"chaussé\" (shod), which must be distinguished from the \"pile\", the point of which does not reach the bottom of the shield. With arched or bent (French: \"\") lines it is called \"chaussé ployé\".\n\nOne common reason for dividing the field in heraldry is for purposes of combining two or more coats of arms to express alliance, inheritance, occupation of an office, etc. This practice, called \"marshalling\", initially took the form of dimidiation, or splicing together two coats of arms split down the middle (or sometimes, though rarely, split across the centre \"per fess\" or quarterly) so that half one coat was matched up with the opposite half of the other. As this would sometimes yield confusing or misleading results, the practice was supplanted by impalement, which kept both coats intact and simply squished them into half the space. According to Fox-Davies (1909), the practice of \"dimidiation\" was short-lived and had already reached its peak in the early 14th century, while impalement remains in practice to modern times. One important remainder of the practice, however, is that when a coat of arms with a bordure is impaled with another coat, the bordure does not continue down the centre, but stops short where it meets the line of impalement. Eventually quartering gained usage, and in the height of its popularity during the Victorian era, some coats of arms featured hundreds of \"quarterings\" (see the Grenville arms at right). More usually, however, a quartered coat of arms consisted of four parts, as the name suggests. The origin and underlying purpose of quartering is to express inheritance by female succession: when a female heir (who has no brothers, or whose brothers have all preceded her in death) dies, her son (only \"after\" her death) quarters her arms with those of his father, placing the father's arms in the first (upper left) and fourth (lower right) quarters and his mother's arms in the second (upper right) and third (lower left).\nIn the UK heraldries, complex systems of marshalling have developed, and continue to thrive, around heraldic expressions of inheritance. In many cases of marriage, the shield is \"impaled\" with the husband's entire coat of arms placed on the dexter side and the wife's entire coat placed on the sinister side; if the wife is an heiress, however, her arms are placed in escutcheon over her husband's (such usage is almost entirely English, Scots marshalling being impaling like any other marriage arms). If the husband is a knight of any order, however, the ensigns of that order belong only to him and are not shared with his wife. Two separate shields are then employed, the dexter shield bearing the husband's arms within the circle of his knighthood, and the sinister shield bearing the husband's arms impaled with the wife's usually encircled with a meaningless wreath of oak leaves for artistic balance. A male peer impales the arms of his wife as described above, but including the supporters, coronet and helmet of the peer; if he is also a knight of any order, the two-shield method is used. If a female peer marries a commoner, however, the husband places her arms inescutcheon, surmounted by a coronet of her rank, over his own, but the supporters of her rank cannot be conferred to him; the wife bears her arms singly on a lozenge with the supporters and coronet of her rank. Volumes may be written on all the endless heraldic possibilities of this convoluted system of marshalling, but it may suffice here to say that for various purposes, arms may be marshalled by four basic methods: \"dimidiation\" by clipping and splicing two coats (usually per pale), \"impalement\" by dividing per pale and crowding an entire coat of arms into each half, \"quartering\" by dividing the shield into usually four (but potentially innumerable) \"quarters\", and \"superimposition\" by placing one coat of arms inescutcheon over another. It is also worth noting that one common form in German-Nordic heraldry is \"quarterly with a heart\" (a shield quartered with an inescutcheon overall). This may have stemmed from the continental practice of sovereigns placing their own hereditary arms inescutcheon over the arms of their dominions.\nThe arms of Novohrad-Volynskyi, Ukraine, show an unusual form of marshalling quarterly with a heart, where one quarter is dimidiated while the others are not.\n\nDivisions of the field, like the ordinaries, may follow complex line shapes. Most of these \"sections\" have developed conventional names in English, but modern artists, particularly in Finland, have developed new sections influenced by shapes found in the local flora. Among the most common of these are engrailed, invected, indented, dancetty, wavy (also called undy), nebuly, embattled, raguly, dovetailed and potenty (pictured below). Notable modern forms include the \"fir twig section\" () and \"fir tree top section\" (). These can be found in the arms of a number of municipalities in Finland, and the latter can also be found in the arms of Mullsjö Municipality in Sweden.\n\nBesides the complex lines discussed above, divisions of the field may also be modified in other ways. Sometimes the division of the field may be \"fimbriated\" (lined) or, perhaps less properly, \"edged\" of another tincture, or \"divided by\" some ordinary or its diminutive. The latter differs from a parted field that then bears the ordinary, in that if the ordinary thus dividing the field is between charges, the charges are not overlapped by the ordinary but the ordinary is between them. A famous example of this is the greater arms of Sweden, which is \"quartered by a cross Or...\"\n\nOne division of the field (though it is sometimes described as a charge) is restricted to the chief: when the chief is divided by a bow-shaped line, this is called a \"chapournet\" or \"chaperonnet\" (\"little hood\"). \"Rompu\", meaning \"broken\", is often applied to a chevron, where the center is usually broken and \"enhanced\" (brought to a sharper point than normal).\n\n\n\n"}

The text is available free online.\n\nPublished in 1992, the \"Encyclopedia\" contains nearly 1500 articles, including several short unattributed entries in four volumes. The text is approximately one million words, and over 1,850 pages including pictures, maps, charts, index, and appendices. The title for the \"Encyclopedia of Mormonism\" was chosen by Macmillan, the secular publisher that initiated the project.\n\nThere were over 730 contributors from a wide variety of fields, most of whom had LDS and academic backgrounds. A large number were professors at Brigham Young University (BYU), the LDS Church-owned university. Most individuals contributed only one article, and few submitted more than three or four. Notable contributors include Mormon historians Leonard J. Arrington and Thomas G. Alexander, former Salt Lake City mayor Ted Wilson, noted non-Mormon LDS historian Jan Shipps, authors Steven R. Covey, Gerald N. Lund, and Richard Eyre, respected scholar and apologist Hugh Nibley, and a few members of LDS hierarchy such as H. David Burton and Jeffery R. Holland.\n\nThe editor of the \"Encyclopedia of Mormonism\", Daniel H. Ludlow, states that he strove to make the volume as professional as possible. Most articles are written by Ph.D.s in their respective fields. LDS general authorities (the spiritual leaders of the church) wrote little of the \"Encyclopedia\"; indeed, most contributors from church hierarchy were only tapped to write articles on the publications or institutions they directly administered or led. For impartiality and perspective, several non-Mormons were asked to write important articles. For example, Shipps wrote on the outsider's interpretation of Mormonism, and Richard P. Howard, a historian of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (now the Community of Christ), wrote on his branch of the Latter Day Saint movement.\n\nThe \"Encyclopedia of Mormonism\" includes lengthy articles on core LDS subjects like LDS Church history and doctrine, but the work also includes many topics that are less closely related to Mormonism. For example, articles on constitutional law, sports, science, and freedom discuss LDS perspectives and contributions to various fields.\n\nLudlow also sought to make the encyclopedia accessible to non-Mormons: an optional fifth volume was printed, containing the \"Standard Works,\" LDS scriptures that are heavily cited in the encyclopedia.\n\nAlthough the LDS Church cooperated in the production of the book, particularly by setting aside BYU resources, the \"Encyclopedia\" was meant to be independent and unofficial in the church. Ludlow highlights that in his concluding preface remarks:\n\nThe LDS Church also noted the position in official publications.\n\nIn addition to established scholars like Nibley, many other LDS scholars who were then less known also contributed, including John Gee, William Hamblin, Louis C. Midgley, Daniel C. Peterson, Noel B. Reynolds, Stephen D. Ricks, John L. Sorenson, Melvin J. Thorne, and John W. Welch.\n\nCritics had mixed reviews. Sterling M. McMurrin said that \"the articles on social issues and church structure and the biographies are the most useful\" but also felt that \"the work is a carefully sanitized partisan affair that, while having many strengths, is quite uneven in quality and, though it appears to face many difficult issues head on, clearly omits, distorts, and compromises wherever necessary to advance and protect a positive image of Mormons, Mormonism, and the church.\" George D. Smith concluded his review of the \"Encyclopedia\" by saying, \"As a 'religious encyclopedia' that addresses a goal of preserving a body of belief, the Encyclopedia of Mormonism impressively fulfills its mission. At the same time, the encyclopedia, like an iceberg, presents only a portion of important background and issues concerning the Book of Mormon. It is a brief for orthodoxy that lacks the scope and diversity necessary to qualify it as truly encyclopedic.\" The introduction to \"Sunstone\"'s review of the \"Encyclopedia\" mentioned that Lavina Fielding Anderson \"pointed out 'pitfalls in the treatment of women's issues, but revealed a few surprisingly positive moments that otherwise might have been overlooked-and probably were by some editors.'\"\n\nNo article of so-called Mormon historical revisionism is found in the \"Encyclopedia\". It has been noted that after the \"Encyclopedia\"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> publication, several LDS scholars were excommunicated, including some members of the 1993 \"September Six.\" George D. Smith criticized the \"Encyclopedia\" because it is not the promised comprehensive treatment of Book of Mormon scholarship: \"it is a statement of LDS orthodoxy.\"\n\n\n"}

Considered a form of cave painting, they occur in caves throughout southern Australia, New Guinea, and southwestern Europe, and were presumably made over a considerable time span including some or all of the Upper Paleolithic. Most are not obvious figures or symbols but, rather, appear to many observers as enigmatic lines. They are also called tracés digitaux or finger tracings and (though these terms are also in part interpretative) meanders, macaroni, and serpentines. The term finger fluting was coined by Robert Bednarik.\n\nGenerally they are made in a substance called moonmilk. Sometimes they are made through a thin clay film into moonmilk underneath or perhaps just into clay.\n\nAs Henri Breuil has published, finger flutings have been recognized since the early days of the 20th century in Europe as Paleolithic. Their recognition as having a similar antiquity outside of Europe lay chiefly in the hands of Sandor (Alexander) Gallus and then in Koonalda Cave in Australia. Many other sites both in Europe and Australia have been found, some of the more famous being Gargas and Baume Latronne caves in France and the cave of Altamira in Spain.\n\nBednarik continues to publish sites that contain flutings, but current forward research into finger flutings is mainly being carried out by Kevin J. Sharpe and Leslie Van Gelder. They have developed the following methods for this purpose. Their cornerstones include multiple examinations of the flutings under investigation, experimentation, and the initial and primarily setting aside of questions of meaning (as such assumptions can determine what investigators then see in the flutings). The physical data in the flutings themselves comprise what they seek: how the fluters constructed their flutings, how the flutings functioned with respect to one other and, if possible, how the flutings functioned for the fluters. Sharpe and Van Gelder use a specific terminology for their studies and call upon three analyses.\n\nA \"fluter\" makes a fluting by sweeping their fingers across a soft surface; a \"unit\" comprises flutings drawn with one sweep of one hand or finger; the \"profile\" of a unit or a fluter comprises the silhouette of the finger tops left in the medium from the fluting; a \"cluster\" comprises an isolatable group of units that exhibit a unity, for instance because they overlay each other; and a \"panel\" comprises a collection of clusters that appears geographically or otherwise distant from other clusters or on a surface of reasonably uniform orientation.\n\nIn terms of the field methodology, having become familiar with a cluster, an Internal Analysis of it is carried out, specially noting the directions of the flutings and their overlays. This provides the differentiation of clusters and units, and the temporal sequence of the flutings. The analysis relates to Alexander Marshack’s question, asked especially for engraved line markings: What do the order, direction of and (especially for engravings) the tools for creation of the lines tell about the mind of the artifact creator when creating? Though Marshack pioneered this technique, it has been modified in its application by others such as Bednarik, Francesco d’Errico, and Michel Lorblanchet. It forms the backbone of research into line markings such as flutings.\n\nOne of their additions to this methodological base, Sharpe and Van Gelder call a ‘Forensic Analysis.’ In this, they record where possible whether the left or right hand made the unit under examination, as indicated by the presence of marks that the first or fifth finger – written F1 or F5 – would make. These appear distinctively different from one another and from the marks of the other fingers. They measure the width of the F2-F4 set of marks at their narrowest, calling this the 3-fingered width of the unit. The width data for the three fingers suggest the age category of the fluter, namely whether a young child or older.\nA Forensic Analysis also examines the profile of a 4- or 5-fingered unit, for frequently units start with the tops of fingers and the investigator needs at least four fingers to tell whether the hand is left or right. Then the investigator records the relative height of F2 to F4 against F3. This would suggest the gender of the fluter painter. Further, consistency of widths and profiles, and perhaps some other features among units suggest the same person painted them with the finger-fluting technique.\n\nSharpe and Van Gelder’s work has focused on flutings found in the French caves of Rouffignac, in the Dordogne, and Gargas in the Hautes Pyrenees. Using the above methods, they have shown:\n\n\nThe lack of thorough studies, let alone methods for doing them, means speculation as to the meaning of flutings runs unchecked, even by the most well-known experts on prehistoric art. They are seen, for example, as representing such things as the first scribbles by humans, though intuitive and random but serpentines (Breuil); water related (Marshack); entopic shapes or phosphenes (Bednarik); huts, comets, or rivers, or linear-phallic and male symbols in the statistical placement of signs within a cave (Leroi-Gourhan); snakes (and thereby associated with death) (Barrière); psycho-neurological archetypes (Gallus); hunting marks (Barrière); shamanic ritual (Lewis-Williams). The corpus of Paleolithic flutings is too complex to fit into a single meaning paradigm. Too much in prehistoric ‘art’ does not conform to what modern people might see as figures and symbols, flutings offering an example. Investigators bring to their study and tie their methods to preconceived notions as to what is meaningful, what constitutes a pattern, and what they think is the origin of fluting making. No one now may ever know the meaning of the flutings and no one now should expect to know it.\n\nThat need not stop people responsibly offering meaning or intentionality hypotheses, Sharpe and Van Gelder state. But all such hypotheses must subject themselves to the data uncovered by investigations using methods such as those above.\n\nTracings of hands and finger flutings often show the dimensions of children.\n\n"}

The episode's teleplay was written by Ted Sullivan and Derek Simon, from a story by Andrew Kreisberg, and directed by Dermott Downs. The episode is based on the Superman story \"For the Man Who Has Everything\", which was written by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons for \"Superman Annual\" #11 in 1985.\n\nKara wakes up on Krypton under a medical assistant robot named Kelex. Her mother Alura returns and tells her she was experiencing the Argo fever. On Earth, a solar storm prevents Cat from reaching Kara. Winn, James and Alex find her body wrapped in the plant. At the DEO, an attempt to pull the plant off Kara winds up nearly killing her. The plant, known as the Black Mercy, was sent by Non. Astra is not happy, given the deal she made to leave Kara alone.\n\nKara realizes this Krypton is not real and wishes to go home, but she sees a statue she made for her father; her memories of Earth begin to fade. She sees Astra and starts blaming her and Non. Alex suggests Hank pose as Kara and he pulls it off, managing to get Cat to give \"Kara\" the day off while Alex attempts getting answers from the holographic Alura, to no avail. Astra offers Alex her assistance to save Kara. Alex recruits Maxwell to help send her into Kara's consciousness to convince her to reject the hallucination. Non confronts Astra about her disappearance, but Astra tells him that nothing could jeopardize their plans. Winn believes the solar storm is a part of the Kryptonians' plan to disrupt Earth's technology through satellites, prompting Hank to allow Winn access to the DEO computers to reboot them.\n\nAlex tries pulling her out of virtual Krypton, only to be knocked out by Kara. James stops Hank from aborting the mission. Alex is sentenced to the Phantom Zone as she tries to reason with Kara. The virtual world starts to break up as Kara comes to her senses. She finally remembers her life on Earth and they are brought back to reality. The plant is removed and Kara seeks revenge on Non, who is planning to use Lord Technologies satellites to weaken and overwrite transmissions. Kara faces off against Non while Alex confronts Astra. Alex discovers the Kryptonians plan to eliminate humanity with a cure known as Myriad. Hank shows up to save Alex, who impales Astra with a kryptonite blade. Kara gets the better of Non and she sees a dying Astra, who apologizes to her. Hank takes responsibility for Astra's death, claiming her killed her, before the three of them leave as the Kryptonians arrive. Non is reminded that his wife did not die in vain as Myriad will be operational. Hank tells Alex she made the right call killing Astra, but Alex is upset over his lie. Kara explains to Alex, James and Winn that feeling lonely and lost made her envision Krypton, but she ultimately missed being on Earth with her family and friends.\n\nThe episode attracted 542,000 viewers for its British premiere, making it the 10th most watched programme on Sky One for the week.\n\nCliff Wheatley of IGN gave the episode a 7.7/10: \"“For the Girl Who Has Everything” isn’t quite the emotional gut-punch that its source material inspires, but it’s a solid episode on its own merits. Surprisingly, the bits dealing with the Black Mercy are the least interesting, but it does inspire a host of other choices that are some of the most compelling the show has offered to date. Plus, there’s some great comedic relief thanks to Cat Grant and J’onn trying (and failing) to impersonate Kara at work. \"\n\nJeff Jensen of \"Entertainment Weekly\" noted: \"When we left Kara last week, she was at a pretty low point. Pretty much all of her relationships (save the one with her sister) were in varying states of disarray Cat, the mentor she needs, wants to keep things strictly “professional.” Winn is barely talking to her, and things with James are just weird. With this baggage going into tonight, we came into “For the Girl Who Has Everything” ready for a poignant episode to set things right, and Supergirl definitely delivered. \"\n\nStacy Glanzman of TV Fanatic gave the episode 4.8 out of 5 stars.\n"}

{"id": "6230784", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6230784", "title": "Hong Kong Cantonese", "text": "Hong Kong Cantonese\n\nHong Kong Cantonese () is a dialect of the Cantonese language commonly spoken in Hong Kong, as well as Macau. Although the Hong Kong people largely identify this variant of Chinese with the term \"Cantonese\" (), a variety of publications in Mainland China describe the variant as \"Hong Kong speech\" ().\n\nThere are slight differences between the pronunciation used in Hong Kong Cantonese and that of the Cantonese spoken in the neighbouring Chinese province of Guangdong, where Cantonese (based on the Guangzhou dialect) is a main \"lingua franca\".\n\nOver the years, Hong Kong Cantonese has also absorbed foreign terminology and developed a large set of Hong Kong-specific terms. These differences from the Guangzhou dialect are the result of British rule between 1841 and 1997, as well as the closure of the Hong Kong-China border immediately after the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949.\n\nBefore the arrival of British settlers in 1842, the inhabitants of Hong Kong mainly spoke the Dongguan-Bao'an (Tungkun–Po'on) and Tanka dialects of Yue, as well as Hakka and Teochew. These languages and dialects are all remarkably different from Guangzhou Cantonese.\n\nAfter the British acquired Hong Kong Island, Kowloon Peninsula and the New Territories from the Qing between 1841 (officially 1842) and 1898, large numbers of merchants and workers came to Hong Kong from the city of Canton, the main center of Cantonese. Cantonese became the dominant spoken language in Hong Kong. The frequent migration between Hong Kong and mainland Cantonese-speaking areas did not cease up until 1949, when the Communists took over Mainland China. During this period, the Cantonese spoken in Hong Kong was very similar to that in Canton.\n\nIn 1949, the year that the People's Republic of China was established, Hong Kong saw a large influx of refugees from different areas of mainland China. The Hong Kong Government closed the border to halt the massive influx, but illegal immigration from Mainland China into Hong Kong continued. Because of this, the correspondence between language and ethnicity may generally be true though not absolute, as many Chinese who speak Hong Kong Cantonese may come from other areas of China, especially Shanghai or non-Cantonese regions of Guangdong where Hakka and Teochew prevail.\n\nMovement, communication and relations between Hong Kong and mainland China became very limited, and consequently the evolution of Cantonese in Hong Kong diverged from that of Guangzhou. In Mainland China, the use of Mandarin as the language of official use and education was enforced. In Hong Kong, Cantonese is the medium of instruction in schools, along with written English and written Chinese.\n\nAnd because of the long exposure to English during the colonial period, large number of English words were loaned into Hong Kong Cantonese, e.g. \"巴士\" (/páːsǐː/), literally, \"bus\". Hong Kong people even started to calque English constructions, for example, \"噉 (咁) 都唔 make sense\" (literally, \"it still does not make sense.\"). Therefore, the vocabularies of Cantonese in Mainland China and Hong Kong substantially differed.\n\nMoreover, the pronunciation of Cantonese changed while the change either did not occur in mainland China or took place much slower. For example, merging of initial into and the deletion of were observed. Due to the limited communication between Hong Kong and mainland China, these changes only had a limited effect in mainland China at that time. As a result, the pronunciation of Cantonese between Hong Kong and mainland China varied, and so native speakers may note the difference when listening to Hong Kong Cantonese and mainland China Cantonese.\n\nHong Kong-based Cantonese can be found in Hong Kong popular culture such as Hong Kong films and Hong Kong pop music (Cantopop). Hong Kong people who have emigrated to other countries have brought Hong Kong Cantonese to other parts of the world.\n\nIn modern-day Hong Kong, many native speakers are unable to distinguish between certain phoneme pairs, causing them to merge one sound into another. Although this is often considered substandard and is frequently denounced as \"lazy sound\" (), the phenomenon is becoming more widespread and is influencing other Cantonese-speaking regions. Contrary to popular opinion, some of these changes are not recent. The loss of the velar nasal () was documented by Williams (1856), and the substitution of the liquid nasal () for the nasal initial () was documented by Cowles (1914). \n\nList of observed shifts:\n\nToday in Hong Kong, people still make an effort to avoid these sound merges in serious broadcasts and in education. Older people often do not exhibit these shifts in their speech, but some do. With the sound changes, the name of Hong Kong's Hang Seng Bank (), , becomes , sounding like \"Hon' Kon' itchy body\" ( ) \"'un cold\" ( ) . The name of Cantonese itself (, \"Guangdong speech\") would be without the merger, whereas (sounding like \"\": \"speak eastern speech\") and (sounding like \"\" : \"chase away eastern speech\") are overwhelmingly popular.\n\nThe shift affects the way some Hong Kong people speak other languages as well. This is especially evident in the pronunciation of certain English names: \"Nicole\" pronounce , \"Nancy\" pronounce etc. A very common example of the mixing of () and () is that of the word , meaning \"you\". Even though the standard pronunciation should be (), the word is often pronounced (), which is the surname , or the word , meaning theory. The merger of () and () also affects the choice of characters when the Cantonese media transliterates foreign names. \n\nPrescriptivists who try to correct these \"lazy sounds\" often end up introducing hypercorrections. For instance, while attempting to ensure that people pronounce the initial , they may introduce it into words which have historically had a null-initial. One common example is that of the word , meaning \"love\". Even though the standard pronunciation would be , but the word is often pronounced .\n\nIn recent years, a number of Hong Kong secondary schools have tried to reverse this change by making the learning of Cantonese Pinyin part of the school Chinese curriculum.\n\nDue to Hong Kong's unique historical background, Hong Kong Cantonese has evolved differently from the Mandarin spoken in China, Taiwan and Singapore over the years. Hong Kong Cantonese has developed a number of phrases and expressions that are unique to the context of Hong Kong. These phrases and expressions usually make references to specific things that can only be found in Hong Kong or specific incidents that happened in Hong Kong.\nHere are a few examples:\n\nHere, the former refers to Hong Kong's status as a British colony, where prisoners are detained on behalf of the Sovereign, and is similar to the English colloquial expression \"guest of Her Majesty\" / \"live at Her Majesty's pleasure\". The latter refers to the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong to China in 1997. The situations alluded to are both unique to Hong Kong.\n\nLife in Hong Kong is characterised by the blending of Asian (southern Chinese in particular) and Western cultures, as well as the city's position as a major international business centre. In turn, Hong Kong influences have also spread widely into other cultures. As a result, a large number of loanwords are created in Hong Kong and then exported to Mainland China, Taiwan, Singapore, and Japan. Some of the loanwords have become even more popular than their Chinese counterparts, in Hong Kong as well as in their destination cultures.\n\nSelected loanwords are shown below.\n\nHong Kong Cantonese has a high number of foreign loanwords. Sometimes, the part of speech of the incorporated words are also changed, like \"佢地好friend\", translated into English as \"they are very 'friend'\", means \"they are good friends\". The word \"friend\" is changed from a noun into an adjective. In some examples, some new meanings of English words are even created. For example, \"至yeah\", literally \"the most yeah\", means \"the trendiest\". Originally, \"yeah\" means \"yes/okay\" in English, but it means \"trendy\" when being incorporated into Hong Kong Cantonese (see also \"yeah baby\" and \"aww yeah\").\n\nSemantic change is common in loanwords; when foreign words are borrowed into Cantonese, polysyllabic words and monosyllabic words tend to become disyllabic, and the second syllable is in the Upper Rising tone (the second tone). For example, \"kon si\" (coins), \"sek kiu\" (security) and \"ka si\" (cast). A few polysyllabic words become monosyllabic though, like \"mon\" (monitor), literally means computer monitor. And some new Cantonese lexical items are created according to the morphology of Cantonese. For example, \"laai 記\" from the word \"library\". Most of the disyllabic words and some of the monosyllabic words are incorporated as their original pronunciation, with some minor changes according to the Cantonese phonotactics.\n\nIncorporating words from foreign languages into Cantonese is also acceptable by most Cantonese speakers. Hong Kong Cantonese speakers frequently code-mix although they can distinguish foreign words from Cantonese ones. For instance, \"噉都唔 make sense\", literally means \"it doesn't make sense\". After a Cantonese speaker decides to code-mix a foreign word in a Cantonese sentence, syntactical rules of Cantonese will be followed. For instance, \"sure\" (肯定) can be used like \"你 su 唔 su aa?\" (are you sure?) as if it were its Cantonese counterpart \"你肯唔肯定?\", using the A-not-A question construction.\n\nIn some circumstances, code-mixing is preferable because it can simplify sentences. For example, Instead of code-switching and using \"check-in\" in expressions like 你check咗in未？(nei5 cek1 zo2 in6 mei6 aa3, 'Have you checked in yet?'), people will have to use the pure Cantonese expression 辦理登機手續 (baan6 lei5 dang1 gei1 sau2 zuk6 'check in (on a plane)' ), which contains six syllables.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6553189", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6553189", "title": "LGBT rights in Japan", "text": "LGBT rights in Japan\n\nLesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) rights in Japan are relatively progressive by Asian standards, although LGBT people lack full legal equality. Same-sex sexual activity was criminalised only briefly in Japan's history between 1872 and 1880, after which a localised version of the Napoleonic Penal Code was adopted with an equal age of consent. Same-sex couples and households headed by same-sex couples are ineligible for the legal protections available to opposite-sex couples, although since 2015 some cities offer \"partnership certificates\" to recognise the relationships of same-sex couples. \n\nJapan's culture and major religions do not have a history of hostility towards homosexuality. A majority of Japanese citizens are reportedly in favor of accepting homosexuality, with a 2013 poll indicating that 54 percent agreed that homosexuality should be accepted by society, while 36 percent disagreed, with a large age gap. Although many political parties have not openly supported or opposed LGBT rights, there are several openly LGBT politicians in office. A law allowing transgender individuals to change their legal gender post-sex reassignment surgery was passed in 2002. Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity is banned in certain cities.\n\nTokyo Rainbow Pride has been held annually since 2012, with attendance increasing every year. A 2015 opinion poll found that a majority of Japanese support the legalisation of same-sex marriage.\n\nHomosexuality and same-sex relations have been documented in Japan since ancient times.\n\nIn the pre-Meiji period, \"nanshoku\" (男色) relationships inside Buddhist monasteries were typically pederastic. The older partner, or , would be a monk, priest or abbot, while the younger partner was assumed to be an , who would be a prepubescent or adolescent boy. The relationship would be dissolved once the boy reached adulthood (or left the monastery). Both parties were encouraged to treat the relationship seriously and conduct the affair honorably, and the \"nenja\" might be required to write a formal vow of fidelity. During the Tokugawa period, some of the Shinto gods, especially Hachiman, Myoshin, Shinmei and Tenjin, \"came to be seen as guardian deities of \"nanshoku\"\" (male–male love).\n\nFrom religious circles, same-sex love spread to the warrior (samurai) class, where it was customary for a boy in the \"wakashū\" age category to undergo training in the martial arts by apprenticing to a more experienced adult man. The relationship was based on the typical \"nenja,\" who loves, and the typically younger \"chigo\", who is loved. The man was permitted, if the boy agreed, to take the boy as his lover until he came of age. These relationships was expected to be exclusive, with both partners swearing to take no other (male) lovers.\n\nAs Japan progressed into the Meiji era, same-sex practices continued. However, there was a growing animosity towards these practices. The practice of \"nanshoku\" began to die out after the Russo-Japanese War. Opposition to homosexuality did not become firmly established in Japan until the 19th and 20th centuries, through the Westernization efforts of the Empire of Japan.\n\nModern Japanese terms for LGBT people include , , , , and .\n\nHomosexuality is legal in Japan. There are no explicit religious prohibitions against homosexuality in the traditional religion of Japan, Shintoism, or in the imported religions of Buddhism (see \"Buddhism and sexual orientation\") or Confucianism. \n\nSodomy was first criminalized in Japan in 1872, in the early Meiji era, to comply with the newly introduced beliefs of Western culture and the Qing legal codes. But this provision was repealed only seven years later by the Penal Code of 1880 in accordance with the Napoleonic Penal Code. Since then, Japan has had no laws against homosexuality. Thus, sex among consenting adults, in private, regardless of sexual orientation and/or gender, is legal under Japanese law.\n\nThe federal age of consent in Japan is 13 years old under the Japanese Criminal Law Code. However, all municipalities and prefectures have their own particular laws such as Tokyo's \"Youth Protection Law\" which prohibit sexual activity with youths who are under 18 years old in most circumstances. As an added note, even though the age of consent in Japan can be 13, the voting age is 18. The age of majority is 20 (a law to lower the age of majority to 18 is scheduled to take effect in 2022) and the driving age is 18. Japan's \"Prostitution Prevention Act\" (1958) only prohibits actual sexual intercourse (or sex controlled by organized crime). That law defines vaginal intercourse as \"true\" sexual conduct, so prostitution involving anal and oral sex is not prohibited directly.\n\nArticle 24 of the Japanese Constitution states that \"Marriage shall be based only on the mutual consent of both sexes and it shall be maintained through mutual cooperation with the equal rights of husband and wife as a basis.\"\n\nAs a result, articles 731 to 737 of the Japanese Civil Code limit marriage to different-sex couples. Same-sex couples are not able to marry, and same-sex couples are not granted rights derived from marriage. Also, same-sex marriages performed abroad are not legally recognized in Japan and bi-national same-sex couples cannot obtain a visa for the foreign partner based on their relationship.\n\nIn March 2009, Japan began allowing Japanese nationals to marry same-sex partners in countries where same-sex marriage is legal. The Justice Ministry instructed local authorities to issue key certificates, which state that a person is single and of legal age, to individuals seeking to enter same-sex marriages in areas that legally allow it. Though same-sex marriages are not legally recognized within Japan, allowing its citizens to marry same-sex partners overseas is seen as a first step toward the eventual legalization of such marriages in Japan.\n\nIn February 2015, the district of Shibuya (in Tokyo) announced plans for a procedure of the recognition of same-sex couples for situations such as hospital visits and shared renting of apartments. This procedure allows couples to get a \"proof of partnership\" paper, which is not based in Japanese law, but can help in, for instance, getting access to a partner who is ill and in the hospital. The Shibuya initiative is considered a significant step towards lesbian and gay partnership rights in Japan. In July 2015, Tokyo's Setagaya ward announced that it would be joining Shibuya in recognizing same-sex partnerships from November of the same year. Since then, the cities of Iga, Takarazuka, Naha, Sapporo, Fukuoka, Osaka and Nakano have begun issuing partnership certificates to same-sex couples.\n\nAs of 2018, sexual orientation is not protected by national civil rights laws, which means that LGBT Japanese have no legal recourse when they face such discrimination in such areas as employment, education, housing, health care and banking.\n\nHowever, cases of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation remain relatively uncommon in Japan. Similarly, the Japan Self-Defense Forces, when being asked about their policy toward gays and lesbians following the U.S. debate during the Clinton presidency, answered that it was not an issue, and individuals within the forces indicated that as long as same-sex relations did not lead to fights or other trouble, there were few, if any, barriers to their inclusion in the armed services.\n\nThe Japanese Constitution promises equal rights and is interpreted to prohibit discrimination on all grounds. However, homosexual and transgender persons can experience physical, sexual and psychological violence at the hands of their opposite-sex or same-sex partners, but receive no protection from the law. Same-sex partners are excluded from the \"Law for the Prevention of Spousal Violence and the Protection of Victims\" and generally lack safe places where they can seek help and support. Japan is a party to the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which also comprehensively bans discrimination.\n\nWhile the \"Equal Opportunity Law\" has been revised several times over the years to address sex discrimination and harassment in the workplace, the Government has refused to expand the law to address discrimination against gender or sexual identity.\n\nIn 1990, the group OCCUR (Japan Association for the Lesbian and Gay Movement) won a court case against a Tokyo government policy that barred gay and lesbian youth from using the \"Metropolitan House for Youth\". While the court ruling does not seem to have extended to other areas of government-sponsored discrimination, it is cited by the courts as a civil rights case, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has since passed legislation banning discrimination in employment based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Shibuya ward also bans sexual orientation discrimination in the provision of goods and services.\n\nSince autumn 2003, the Urban Renaissance Agency, the government agency that operates government housing (公団住宅), has allowed same-sex couples to rent units the same way as heterosexual couples at any one of the over 300 properties that it operates. This opened the way for more such action, as the Osaka Government in September 2005 opened the doors of its government housing to same-sex couples.\n\nIn 2013, Yodogawa-ku, Osaka became the first Japanese government area to pass a resolution officiating support for LGBT inclusion, including mandating LGBT sensitivity training for ward staff. Naha followed suit in July 2015.\n\nIn 2017, the Education Ministry added sexual orientation and gender identity to its national bullying policy. The policy mandates that schools should prevent bullying of students based on their sexual orientation or gender identity by \"promoting proper understanding of teachers on … sexual orientation/gender identity as well as making sure to inform on the school's necessary measures regarding this matter.\"\n\nIn October 2018, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government passed a law prohibiting all discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. The law, scheduled to take effect in April 2019, also commits the Government to raise awareness of LGBT people and \"conduct measures needed to make sure human rights values are rooted in all corners of the city\". The law outlaws expressing hateful rhetoric in public.\n\nSame-sex couples are not allowed to legally adopt in Japan. Lesbian couples and single women are unable to access IVF and artificial insemination.\n\nIn April 2017, Osaka officially recognised a same-sex couple as foster parents, making it the first such case in Japan.\n\nIn 2002, a law was passed allowing transgender people who have gone through sex reassignment surgery to change their legal gender. However, sterilization is required, among many other challenging criteria. The law went into effect in 2003. On 24 February 2012, the Hyogo Lawyers' Association pronounced a recommendation for a transgender woman in a male prison to be transferred to a female institution. According to this report, the transgender woman was placed in a male institution because of her legal status of sex, despite having undergone sex reassignment surgery prior to her detention, and had had her body checked by a male member of staff, her hair shaved and was refused any feminine treatment including female clothing.\n\nSince April 2018, transgender people have been covered for sex reassignment surgery as long as they are not receiving hormone treatment. The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has also allowed transgender people to use their preferred names on their health insurance cards.\n\nIn June 2018, the Japanese Government enacted a new law lowering the age of majority in Japan to 18. Among others, the new law sets the age of marriage at 18 for both men and women (previously women could marry at the age of 16) and allows 18-year-olds to obtain valid passports, credit cards, etc. The law also allows people diagnosed with gender dysphoria to legally change their sex at the age of 18. The changes are scheduled to take effect on 1 April 2022.\n\nGay and bisexual men are allowed to donate blood in Japan following a 6-month deferral period.\n\nWhile representations of homosexuals in the Japanese media tend towards caricature on the basis of stereotypes of sexual or behavioral deviance (e.g. the actually straight Hard Gay), there are several examples of transgender persons with popular celebrity status in Japan such as Haruna Ai, Kayo Satoh, Matsuko Deluxe, Ataru Nakamura, Kaba-chan and Ikko. Support for LGBT rights has been expressed by corporate executives and Olympic athlete Dai Tamesue.\n\nLGBT rights are rarely discussed or debated publicly, and most political parties do not make any formal position, in favor of or in opposition, to LGBT rights in their party's platform or manifesto. However, some parties have responded to enquiries concerning same-sex marriage policy: the Liberal Democratic Party has indicated opposition to legalizing it, and the Constitutional Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party have indicated support for legalization, while the Communist Party has indicated support for legalizing same-sex civil unions. \n\nIn 2001, the Council for Human Rights Promotion, under the Ministry of Justice, recommended that sexual orientation be included in the nation's civil rights code, but the Diet refused to adopt the recommendation.\n\nIn 2003, Aya Kamikawa became the first openly transgender politician to be elected to public office in Japan, the Setagaya Ward Assembly. She initially ran as an Independent but expressed support for the now defunct Rainbow and Greens Party of Japan and later unsuccessfully ran for the National Parliament as a member of the Democratic Party of Japan.\n\nIn 2005, Kanako Otsuji, from the Osaka Prefectural Assembly, became the first homosexual politician to formally come out at the Tokyo Gay Pride Festival.\n\nIn 2011, Taiga Ishikawa became the first openly gay candidate elected to office in Japan, specifically as the representative for the local assembly of Toshima Ward. He came out publicly in his book \"Where Is My Boyfriend\" (2002), and started a non-profit organization that sponsors social events for gay men in Japan.\n\nAt the 2016 House of Councillors election, the conservative governing Liberal Democratic Party included \"promoting understanding of sexual diversity\" in its platform, a move that would have been \"unthinkable\" in earlier times and that lawmaker Gaku Hashimoto attributed in part to burnishing the country's international image in advance of the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.\n\nIn March 2017, Tomoya Hosoda was elected to the Iruma Assembly, in the prefecture of Saitama. Hosoda is believed to be the first openly transgender man elected to public office in the world.\n\nDuring the country's 2017 general election, Governor of Tokyo Yuriko Koike's newly launched Party of Hope pledged the elimination of LGBT discrimination in its manifesto.\n\n\n"}

The philosophy can be summarized as \"more is more\", contrasting with the minimalist motto \"less is more\"\n\nThe term \"maximalism\" is sometimes associated with post-modern novels, such as those by David Foster Wallace and Thomas Pynchon, where digression, reference, and elaboration of detail occupy a great fraction of the text. It can refer to anything seen as excessive, overtly complex and \"showy\", providing redundant overkill in features and attachments, grossness in quantity and quality, or the tendency to add and accumulate to excess.\n\nNovelist John Barth defines literary maximalism through the medieval Roman Catholic Church's opposition between \"two...roads to grace:\"\n\nTakayoshi Ishiwari elaborates on Barth's definition by including a postmodern approach to the notion authenticity. Thus:\n\nIn music, Richard Taruskin uses the term \"maximalism\" to describe the modernism of the period from 1890 to 1914, especially in German-speaking regions, defining it as \"a radical intensification of means toward accepted or traditional ends\". This view has been challenged, however, on the grounds that Taruskin uses the term merely as an \"empty signifier\" that is filled with \"a range of musical features—big orchestration, motivic and harmonic complexity, and so on—that he takes to be typical of modernism\". Taruskin, in any case, did not originate this sense of the term, which had been used by the mid-1960s with reference to Russian composers of the same period, of whom Sergei Prokofiev was \"the last\". Contemporary maximalist music is defined by composer David A. Jaffe as that which \"embraces heterogeneity and allows for complex systems of juxtapositions and collisions, in which all outside influences are viewed as potential raw material\". Examples include the music of Edgard Varèse, Charles Ives, and Frank Zappa. In a different sense, Milton Babbitt has been described as a \"professed maximalist\", his goal being, \"to make music as much as it can be rather than as little as one can get away with\". Richard Toop, on the other hand, considers that musical maximalism \"is to be understood at least partly as 'antiminimalism'\". Kanye West's \"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\" (2010) has also been described as a maximalist work.\n\nMaximalism as a term in the plastic arts is used by art historian Robert Pincus-Witten to describe a group of artists, including Julian Schnabel and David Salle, associated with the turbulent beginnings of Neo-expressionism in the late 1970s. These artist were in part \"stimulated out of sheer despair with so long a diet of Reductivist Minimalism\" This maximalism was prefigured in the mid-1960s by certain psychoanalytically oriented paintings by Gary Stephan.\n\nCharlotte Rivers describes how \"maximalism celebrates richness and excess in graphic design\", characterized by decoration, sensuality, luxury and fantasy, citing examples from the work of illustrator Kam Tang and artist Julie Verhoeven.\n\nArt historian Gao Minglu connects maximalism in Chinese visual art to the literary definition by describing the emphasis on \"the spiritual experience of the artist in the process of creation as a self-contemplation outside and beyond the artwork itself...These artists pay more attention to the process of creation and the uncertainty of meaning and instability in a work. Meaning is not reflected directly in a work because they believe that what is in the artist's mind at the moment of creation may not necessarily appear in his work.\" Examples include the work of artists, Cao Kai, Ding Yi, Gu Dexin and Li Huasheng.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2175370", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2175370", "title": "Mega Man X5", "text": "Mega Man X5\n\nMega Man X5, known as in Japan, is a video game developed by Capcom. It is the fifth main installment in the \"Mega Man X\" series. It was first released for the PlayStation for Japan in 2000 and in North America and PAL territories the following year.\n\n\"Mega Man X5\" is set in the 22nd century in a world where humans coexist with humanoid androids called \"Reploids\". Daily life is under a constant threat of these Reploids going \"Maverick\" and participating in dangerous and deadly crime. After the events of \"Mega Man X4\", the Maverick leader Sigma has been revived and seeks to unlock the true power of the former Maverick Zero and destroy the hero X in the process. To make matters worse, Sigma has set the space colony Eurasia on a 16-hour collision course with Earth. It is up to X and Zero to stop Sigma once again and save the planet from destruction. Like its predecessors, \"Mega Man X5\" is an action-platform game in which the player controls either protagonist through a series of eight, selectable stages and wins the special weapon of each stage's boss. However, the game only offers limited number of stage attempts before the player must deal with the colony.\n\nAccording to Capcom producer Keiji Inafune, \"Mega Man X5\" was originally intended to be the final game in the \"Mega Man X\" saga. Critical reception for the game was lukewarm, with many reviewers agreeing that the stale gameplay formula will only further satisfy diehard fans of the series. \"Mega Man X5\" was ported to the Microsoft Windows as retail packages in 2002 in both Japan and North America. It was also re-released in 2006 as part of the \"Mega Man X Collection\" for the GameCube and PlayStation 2. \"Mega Man X5\" was made available on the PlayStation Network as part of the PSOne Classics line for North America and Japan in 2014. It became available for Windows via Steam, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch as a part of \"Mega Man X Legacy Collection 2\" (\"Rockman X Anniversary Collection 2\" in Japan) on July 24, 2018 worldwide and July 26, 2018 in Japan.\n\nLike other entries in the series, \"Mega Man X5\" takes place in \"21XX\", an unspecified year in the 22nd century, where humans have adapted to life with intelligent android dubbed \"Reploids\". Months have passed since the events of Mega Man X4. The series' primary antagonist, a \"Maverick\" Reploid named Sigma has been revived once again. Sigma begins conducting research on the origin and design of the \"Maverick Hunter\" Zero and decides to discover how to unlock Zero's true power, hoping to destroy Sigma's nemesis Mega Man X in addition. Sigma attacks the Maverick Hunters directly, intending to lose. When he does, he spreads a Maverick virus across the Earth, throwing it into chaos. Meanwhile, a Reploid mercenary named Dynamo is hired by Sigma to make the space colony Eurasia collide with Earth. The Hunters have only 16 hours to stop the collision. In order to prevent Eurasia from striking the planet, the Hunters pursue two options. The first option is to fire a powerful cannon called \"Enigma\" at Eurasia, vaporizing it. If the Enigma shot fails, the second option is to launch a space shuttle and pilot it into the colony, destroying it. To maximize their chances, X and Zero are dispatched to collect parts for the two devices with the aid of their new teammates Alia, Douglas, and Signas. The necessary parts to upgrade the Enigma and shuttle are held by eight Mavericks, and X and Zero must defeat them to claim the parts.\n\nWhether the Enigma and shuttle succeed or fail is randomly determined by the game, although the Enigma's chances of working successfully are low even with all its parts, while the shuttle has a much higher probability of succeeding assuming all of the parts are collected. Whether the Enigma succeeds or fails, a new virus appears on the Earth, noted by Alia as the Sigma virus combining with the scraps from the colony. If the Enigma or the shuttle succeeds, X and Zero proceed to hunt for the cause of the virus. If the shuttle fails or if the time expires, the colony crashes, nearly destroying the planet; Zero then is infected by the virus. In either case, once the location of the virus' origin is discovered, the Hunters investigate. X and Zero penetrate a bizarre underground fortress. In the fortress, X and Zero cross paths, where mutual suspicion and mistrust leads to a duel between the heroes.\n\nAfter the duel, the story diverges slightly. If Zero goes Maverick as a result of the virus, he sacrifices himself to save X from Sigma, and X continues on alone to defeat Sigma. If Zero does not go Maverick, he saves X and himself from Sigma, and both have a chance to confront Sigma. \"Mega Man X5\" has three possible endings. If Zero goes Maverick, X defeats Sigma, but is badly damaged. A mysterious figure recovers him, but also deletes all his memories of Zero. If Zero does not go Maverick, Sigma decides to make the Hunters' victory for naught by taking them down with him. X tries to save Zero but is ambushed by Sigma and both Hunters are critically damaged. Zero manages to finish Sigma off, then the endings diverge again depending on the player character. If Zero defeats Sigma, he reflects on his origin and life before dying. If X defeats Sigma, he inherits Zero's beam saber weapon and continues to fight as a Maverick Hunter.\n\nThe main gameplay remains similar to previous installments. Unlike \"X4\", the player can freely switch between both the shooter X and the swordsman Zero while playing through the game. Depending on which character the player uses to start it, the other one will be affected negatively with X losing his \"X4\" armor and Zero losing his buster. There are four armors for X—his Ultimate Armor, the upgraded armor from \"Mega Man X4\", and two others that must be assembled from capsules. However, X cannot wear parts of these armors separately. X can also no longer shoot his buster through walls, and each character has the ability to duck. Zero is able to find and enter Dr. Light's capsules, however, he cannot use the armor parts given, instead retaining the part to bring to X. However, if Zero reaches the capsule that contains X's Ultimate Armor, Dr. Light will offer the \"Black Zero\" Armor instead of the Ultimate Armor that enhances his abilities. Besides regular enemies and bosses, X and Zero can be chased by a phantom virus that will try to infect the characters. If X is sufficiently infected by enough viruses, he will enter a state where his health rapidly declines. However, if Zero is sufficiently infected, he becomes briefly invincible, with increased attack power. At any point between levels, the player has the option of firing the Enigma at the Eurasia. If the Enigma misses, then the player has the option of launching the shuttle. Whether the crash is prevented or not is determined by random chance. If the crash is not prevented, the course of the story is changed. Due to the nature of the storyline, there are multiple endings. Whether X or Zero is used to defeat the last boss also affects which ending is seen.\n\n\"Mega Man X5\" was originally meant to be the last game of the \"Mega Man X\" series. As stated by producer Keiji Inafune, \"I had very little to do with \"X5\". I just told the team to 'finish off the series with this title,' and left it at that. That's why the game itself has a real feel of finality to it.\" However, Capcom decided to publish \"Mega Man X6\" the following year, in which Zero survived his fight from \"X5\", much to the dismay of Inafune. Haruki Suetsugu, an artist for \"Mega Man X4\", designed nearly all of the characters and promotional artwork for \"Mega Man X5\". Suetsugu added various details to set the characters apart from one another. X's new Falcon Armor was designed by Ryuji Higurashi, who wanted it to resemble a bird with beak-shaped chest piece, wings coming out of the back, and a talon-like arm cannon. Suetsugu designed the Gaea Armor, which was meant to resemble Sanagiman from the \"Inazuman\" manga series. The Maverick bosses in the English localization of \"Mega Man X5\" are named after members of the American hard rock band Guns N' Roses. Capcom voice actress Alyson Court, who was involved in the game's localization, came up with the new names as a tribute to her then-husband's love of the band. For the \"Mega Man X Legacy Collection 2\" release, the Maverick Bosses names were changed to translations of their original Japanese names.\n\nThe musical score for \"Mega Man X5\" was composed by Naoto Tanaka, Naoya Kamisaka, and Takuya Miyawaki. The Japanese version of \"Mega Man X5\" features one opening theme, \"Monkey\", and one closing theme, , both composed and performed by Showtaro Morikubo and his band Mosquito Milk. All of the game's instrumental and vocal music was compiled on the \"\" soundtrack released by Suleputer in 2003. The theme songs were also included on the \"Rockman Theme Song Collection\", published by Suleputer in 2002.\n\n\"Mega Man X5\" was generally well-received, with IGN giving the game an 8.5 out of 10. However, they added that though the game was fun to play, it was \"more of the same\" from Capcom, and that \"Mega Man\", like many other series made by Capcom, was being milked for as much as it was worth. GameSpot similarly commented that \"Fans of the classic 2D games will no doubt find much to love in \"X5\", while those who can't get into the aging conventions and mechanics probably won't care a great deal for it.\" The \"Official UK PlayStation Magazine\" said that the game was \"unforgivably primitive\".\n\nAccording to the Japanese publication \"Famitsu\", \"Mega Man X5\" was the third best-selling video game in Japan during its release week at 46,033 copies sold. It placed at number eight the following week with an additional 22,963 copies sold. Media Create sales information showed that the game was 96th best-selling video game in Japan during 2000. Dengeki Online reported that \"Mega Man X5\" sold a total of 215,687 copies in Japan by the end of 2001, listing it as the 132nd best-selling game of the year in the region. The game was eventually re-released as part of Sony's PlayStation The Best for Family range of budget titles in Japan. Toy Retail Sales Tracking (TRST) sales data showed that \"Mega Man X5\" was the fifth best-selling PlayStation game in North America for the month of February 2001. The game was included on the North American \"Mega Man X Collection\" for the Nintendo GameCube and PlayStation 2 in 2006.\n \n"}

{"id": "125290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=125290", "title": "Names given to the Spanish language", "text": "Names given to the Spanish language\n\nThere are two names given in Spanish to the Spanish language: español (\"Spanish\") and castellano (\"Castilian\"). Spanish speakers from different countries or backgrounds can show a preference for one term or the other, or use them indiscriminately, but political issues or common usage might lead speakers to prefer one term over the other. This article identifies the differences between those terms, the countries or backgrounds that show a preference for one or the other, and the implications the choice of words might have for a native Spanish-speaker.\n\nFormally speaking, the national language of Spain, the official Spanish language, is the Castilian language (as opposed to regional Spanish languages like Catalan, Asturleonese and Basque). As such both names, \"español\" and \"castellano\", have distinct and independent meanings that may be required for clarity in some specific contexts.\nGenerally speaking, though, both terms can be used to refer to the (national) Spanish language as a whole, with a preference for one over the other that depends on the context or the speaker's origin. \"Castellano\" (as well as \"Castilian\" in English) has another, more restricted, meaning, relating either to the old Romance language spoken in the Kingdom of Castile in the Middle Ages, predecessor of the modern Spanish language, or to the variety of Spanish nowadays spoken in the historical region of Castile, in central Spain.\n\nOriginally \"Castilian (castellano)\" referred to the language of the Kingdom of Castile, one of several northern kingdoms that spread across the Iberian Peninsula through the Middle Ages, from about the 8th to the 15th centuries. Traditionally the first recorded examples of written Castilian/Spanish are considered to be the \"Glosas Emilianenses\", a number of isolated words added to a Latin text as an aid to the reader, dated to the eleventh century. Soon after that there begin to appear discursive texts in Castilian, such as the \"Cantar de Mio Cid\". This early Romance language was derived from Latin and evolved into modern Spanish.\n\nHowever, the term \"Spanish\" (\"español\") is a more recent term that first referred to Spain as a country, and then to the predominant language spoken in that country. Spain as a truly unified nation appeared centuries later than the language and the Kingdom of Castile; in fact, it was only in the late 15th century that the personal union between the Crowns of Castile and Aragon unified Spain. The actual legal unification date is disputed, but commonly agreed to have occurred not earlier than the eighteenth century at the end of the War of the Spanish Succession. Only then did the Castilian language begin to be commonly called Spanish.\n\nIn 1492, the arrival of Christopher Columbus on a Castilian-paid expedition paved the way for the Spanish colonization of the Americas. As a result of this process, most countries in South America now speak the same language as Castile. Until about the eighteenth century, the Kingdom of Castile, and not Spain as a whole, was the colonizing power, and the language used was called \"castellano\". Thus, some Latin American countries formerly under Spanish rule have retained the custom of calling it \"castellano\", while others eventually switched to calling it \"español\", with many different factors influencing the final choice.\n\nIn English, the term \"Spanish\" relates both to the language and to the nation. The noun used for a person from Spain is \"Spaniard\", with the collective noun \"the Spanish\". The term \"Castilian\" is much less widespread amongst English speakers than the term \"Spanish\".\n\nTwo main hypotheses have been proposed for the origin of the word \"español\": one based on dissimilation in Old Spanish \"españón\" (from a presumed Vulgar Latin *\"hispaniōne\"), and the other on an Occitan term derived from a presumed Vulgar Latin *\"hispaniolus\". Both Latin ancestor words are based on the place name \"Hispania\" (which evolved into \"España\" by regular sound changes); and both are marked with an asterisk to indicate that they are reconstructed, not directly attested.\n\nThe dissimilation hypothesis, advanced by Ramón Menéndez Pidal, presumes that Latin \"Hispania\" was lengthened by the derivational suffix \"-ōne\" (which survives in other ethnonyms such as \"bretón\", \"borgoñón\", \"sajón\", and \"lapón\"). The Old Spanish form \"españon\" is documented in works of the 13th and 14th centuries. It is suggested that the final /n/ of this form changed to /l/ by dissimilation from the previous nasal consonant, \"ñ\". This sporadic sound change is observed in some other words: Menéndez Pidal cites \"Barcelona\" (from \"Barcinone\") and \"delante\" (from \"de in ante\"); Lathrop adds \"ingle\" (from \"ing[ui]ne\") and \"sangre\" (from \"sang[ui]ne\").\n\nAccording to the Occitan scenario, advanced by Rafael Lapesa, the Spanish borrowed the Occitan name for themselves, which was the name \"España\" plus the diminutive suffix \"-ol\", from the Latin \"-olus\". The Occitan influence is inferred because in Castilian the same Latin suffix would have produced *\"españuelo\" rather than \"español\". Lapesa counters the dissimilation hypothesis by citing other words with \"-ñón\" in which dissimilation did not take place: \"cañón\", \"borgoñón\", \"riñón\", etc. Penny, in discussing loans from French and Occitan, calls this \"the most remarkable loan of all, \"español\" 'Spanish', replacing native \"españón\".\"\n\nThe name \"Hispania\" was applied to the Iberian Peninsula by the Romans when they discovered and later subjugated it. One theory about this name is that it comes from Canaanite אי שפנים (\"ʾî šəpānîm\"), meaning 'island of hyraxes', named by Canaanite-speaking Phoenicians who mistook Spain's large rabbit population for hyraxes. Several other theories about the name have been advanced as well (see Hispania).\n\nThe Romans called the inhabitants of Hispania \"hispani\" (singular: \"hispanus\"), and the relevant adjective was \"hispanicus\". These terms, had they undergone regular sound change into Castilian, would have developed into \"España\", *\"espanos\" (singular: *\"espano\") and *\"espánego\" or *\"espango\"—but in reality, only the first term exists in modern Castilian.\n\nAs the branches of Vulgar Latin began to evolve into separate Romance languages, the term that would evolve into \"español\" began to be used to refer to these derivative languages (especially as opposed to the Arabic and Hebrew of the Moorish and Jewish inhabitants of Iberia). It was at first a general term that embraced the various dialects of Iberian Romance spoken in the area, including the forebears of modern Portuguese, Galician, Castilian and Catalan. However, with the rise of Castile as a power, and its absorption of all surrounding regions into an ever-growing empire that eventually spread to the New World, the term \"España\" was eventually equated with the peninsular territories ruled by the Crown. With this, the break with the Roman concept of \"Hispania\" was complete, and the term acquired its modern meaning of 'all of Iberia except for Portugal and Andorra'. Similarly, \"español\" came to be used to refer to the common language of this new country: Castilian.\n\nThe terms \"España\" and \"español\" spread to other languages. The English name \"Spain\" is from the French \"Espagne\". \"Spanish\" is \"Spain\" plus the English suffix \"-ish\". The term continues evolving as other languages adapt these words to form their own name for Spain—for example, Japanese スペイン語 (\"Supein-go\"), 'Spanish language', and スペイン人 (\"Supein-jin\"), 'Spaniard', derive from the Japanese word for Spain, スペイン (\"Supein\"), which, in turn, derives from English \"Spain\". In Chinese, the word is taken directly from Spanish (or perhaps even Latin) rather than English: 西班牙 ( \"xībānyá\") for Spain and 西班牙语 ( \"xībānyá yǔ\"), or the abbreviation 西語 ( \"xī yǔ\") for the Spanish language. The Arabic إسبانية (\"isbāniya\") for Spain derives directly from the word \"España\": the absence of \"p\" in the Arabic alphabet makes it a \"b\", and the sound \"ñ\" is transformed into \"n\". إسباني (isbāni) is the name for Spanish, with the \"nisba\" suffix.\n\nIn Guatemala, although Spanish is the official language, the Maya peoples, descendants of the original inhabitants of the region, call it \"la castilla\", keeping the original name from colonial times. Mayans speak at least 22 different Mayan languages and dialects, including Mam, Pocomam, Kaqchikel, Tz’utujil, Q’eqchi’, and K’iche’.\n\n\"Castilla\" (\"Castile\" in English) means 'Castle-land'. The word is derived from Latin \"castella\", the plural of \"castellum\", which, in turn, is a diminutive form of \"castrum\" 'fortress, castle'. Through most of the Middle Ages the word was spelled \"Castiella\", a form that survives in Leonese today. (Modern Spanish has transformed all words ending in \"-iello\", \"-iella\" into \"-illo\", \"-illa\".) The adjective derived from \"Castilla\" is \"castellano\". \"Castellano\" also means 'castellan', i.e. a castle master. There is a comic scene based on the play on words \"Castilian\"/\"castellan\" in the novel \"Don Quixote\" (Chapter 2).\n\nThe region was thus named because it was a frontier land controlled from a series of fortified castles. It shared borders with rival Moorish Spain (to the south) and the Christian kingdoms of Leon (to the west) and Navarre and Aragon (to the east).\n\nWhile \"espanyol\" is used in Standard Philippine and other languages of the Philippines, the word \"kastilà\" is more frequently used. Furthermore \"katsila\" is also used among those who speak Visayan languages, such as Cebuano.\n\nDuring the presence of Moors in Hispania, Spanish was sometimes given the name \"cristiano\" (\"Christian\") to distinguish it from the Arabic and Hebrew languages. This term is still used occasionally today to refer to the language, in a jocular tone.\nThe expression \"Hábleme en cristiano\" \"talk to me in Christian\", uttered to people not speaking Spanish at the moment, is used in opposition of the other languages of Spain, which is felt as annoying by them (Catalonia, Galicia and the Basque Country, but not in the Americas). \"Háblame en cristiano\" is also a phrase used to ask for clarification in a conversation, when the topic of the discussion is not clear or is vaguely hinted at by one of the speakers.\n\nThe term \"lengua de Cervantes\" as an epithet for the Spanish language begins to be used early in the 19th century. Mariano José de Larra uses the expression in his essay \"Literatura\", first published in 1823. In 1829 it appears in \"Una cuestión de derecho\", by Manuel Sivela. Soon after that it appears in an anonymous article in the \"Gaceta de Madrid\". The poet Nicasio Camilo Jover, in his poem \"Miguel de Cervantes\", states directly \"Y la lengua del pueblo castellano / Hoy se llama \"la lengua de Cervantes\".\" Spanish is called \"el idioma de Cervantes\" in a book published in 1830, and in another one published in 1838.\n\nOccasionally the term refers to the language of Spanish Golden Age literature generally, rather than simply to that of Cervantes.\n\n\"The language of Cervantes\" in English—as a term for the Spanish language generally—comes into use in the 1840s. Examples appear in Janin (1841) and Campbell (1849).\n\nThe poet Gonzalo de Berceo, writing in the 13th century, used the phrase \"román paladino\" to mean simple, straightforward language, the language spoken by the common people, as opposed to Latin. In the famous passage from his \"Vida de Santo Domingo de Silos\", Berceo says \"Quiero fer una prosa en roman paladino, / en cual suele el pueblo fablar con so vezino; / ca non so tan letrado por fer otro latino. / Bien valdra, como creo, un vaso de bon vino\" (\"I want to write verse [sic] in clear vernacular, in which the townsfolk speak to their neighbor; for I'm not so learned as to make another in Latin. It will be worth, I think, a glass of good wine\"). \"Roman\"—and, more frequently \"romanz\" (and later \"romance\")—was used in medieval Spanish as a synonym of \"castellano\", i.e. the language now commonly called Old Spanish. And \"paladino\" meant—in Berceo's time the same as it does today—\"public, clear, obvious\". (Old Spanish \"paladino\" existed alongside its learned cognate \"palatino\", which usually referred to the Palatine Hill of Rome. Both words are derived ultimately from Latin \"palatīnus\" \"of the palace\", with influence from Latin \"palam\" \"openly\".) Today \"román paladino\" is a high-sounding epithet for clear, straightforward Spanish. Recently it has been popularized in public speeches by Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who has used it frequently as an equivalent for \"I will clearly state...\".\n\nIn Spain, the Royal Spanish Academy is a normative body that rules on the orthography and general usage rules of the language. The Academy has used \"castellano\" since the 18th century, but since 1923, its dictionary and grammar are \"de la lengua española\" (\"of the Spanish language\"). The Academy's usage of one term is not necessarily a condemnation of the other.\n\nThere are many other academies (grouped under the Association of Spanish Language Academies) that may or may not have an official normative recognition but nevertheless cooperate in the creation of the \"Diccionario panhispánico de dudas\" (a compendium of corrected typical mistakes and doubts). The dictionary, whose production was agreed upon by the 22 different Spanish Language Academies, says:\n\nThus, even if both terms are allowed in Spanish, the use of \"español\" is recommended for the language as a whole. However, popular choice of terms is not so clear, with other factors, such as customs or geographical location, being factors.\n\nSpaniards tend to call the language \"español\" (Spanish) to contrast it to languages of other states, such as in a list with French (\"francés\"), Chinese (\"chino\"), etc. \"Castellano\" (Castilian) by contrast, is more often used when contrasting the language with other regional languages of Spain: official languages like Basque, Catalan and Galician or unofficial ones like Aragonese, Asturian, Extremaduran and Leonese. The Spanish Constitution of 1978 uses the term \"el castellano\" to define the official language of the whole State, opposed to \"las demás lenguas españolas\" (\"the other Spanish languages\"). Article 3 reads in part:\n\nThis choice of words, however, varies depending on many factors, including the origin of the speaker or some political nuances.\n\nIn the regions where regional languages are spoken, there is obviously a daily need to make the contrast between the national language and the regional language and so the national language is most often referred to as Castilian, particularly in the regional languages themselves (for example, \"espanyol\" is virtually never used to refer to the language in Catalan: \"castellà\" is used instead; in Basque, the name of the language is \"gaztelania\" or \"gaztelera\", never \"espainiera\"; and in Galician, the most commonly used term is \"castelán\" rather than \"español\"). That is often mirrored by educated English-speakers to refer to the linguistic situation in Spain.\n\nFor some, this use of the term \"castellano\" is a political or cultural statement that Spanish is only the language of Castile, perhaps also of some areas that Castile colonised, but not the language of their region, which they consider the only legitimate language to be the regional one: Catalan, Basque, Galician etc. That stance is common in regionalist circles.\n\nConversely, some nationalist circles prefer the term \"español\" because they perceive their ethnic community to be distinct from that of Spain and therefore do not object to the language of Spain being called Spanish. In Basque-speaking regions, whose language is not of Romance origin (Basque is considered by many scholars to be a language isolate), some Basque speakers also use the term \"erdara\" or \"erdera\" (\"foreign\") specifically for Spanish, since for them, it is the prevalent foreign language, just as in the French Basque Country, \"French language\" is the usual meaning of \"erdara\"; in fact, \"erdara\" is another language, different from Basque.\n\nIn monolingual regions, the implications are a little different. In such regions, there is no identity implication, but still, they must choose one of the two terms. Castilians usually use the term \"el español\", legitimately presenting it as the national language . However, they also frequently call it \"el castellano\", either to assert their ownership or to distinguish it from the regional languages.\n\nMonolingual regions outside of Castile include mainly Andalusia but also other regions where the regional languages are not developed enough to be widely spoken by the majority of the population, such as Extremadura, Cantabria or Aragon. There, \"español\" may be used, as in Castile, to stress the national nature of the language but with a slightly different nuance: they are accepting another region's historical language as their own.\n\nThe term \"castellano\" is occasionally used to imply more of a standard form than \"español\" does. For example, if someone mispronounces a word, they might be told \"¡Habla castellano!\", i.e. 'Speak Castilian!', 'Speak properly!'. However, that nuance is not to be exaggerated, as it is perfectly possible that the term \"español\" or even, jocularly, \"cristiano\" ('Christian') could be used instead. Moreover, the term \"castellano\" is also commonly and correctly used to refer to dialects of Spanish, which deviate dramatically from the standard.\n\nBoth names are commonly used in parts of the world colonized by Spanish speakers, such as Latin America and the Canary Islands. As in Spain, the implications are complex. The most common term used in Latin America is \"español\", generally considered to be a neutral term simply reflecting the country that the language came from. For people who use that term, \"castellano\" may possibly imply greater correctness, as it sometimes does in Spain, or it may merely be an alien term, referring to a region in a far-off country.\n\nHowever, some Latin Americans prefer the term \"castellano\", especially in Argentina, Chile, and Peru. One reason for this is that many early Argentine settlers were Galician, for whom \"castellano\" had long been associated with the Spanish state in addition to Castile. Along with Basques or Catalans, Galicians might perceive the term \"español\" as imperialistic and misrepresenting the language of Castile as the language of Spain.\n\nPeruvians often prefer the term \"castellano\" for similar reasons to avoid the linkage between \"español\" and \"España\". The Governorate of New Castile (Gobernación de Nueva Castilla) was established in Lima, Peru in 1528, and Peruvian history classes still emphasize the Castilian origin of the first conquerors and settlers. That tendency often manifests itself in a preference for films dubbed into Latin American Spanish, which often take longer to reach the market, over those in \"Español\" (Peninsular Spanish characterized by the use of \"vosotros\"), which tend to be found in pirated \"cam\" versions of films. Using \"español\" to refer to Peninsular Spanish is exactly the opposite of how English-speakers use the two terms, which can create some confusion.\n\n\"Castellano\" may also be used to refer to the dialect of Spanish spoken in Castile, and \"español\" would generally refer to Standard Spanish. In practice, usage tends to be a matter of local custom rather than reflecting any philosophical or political position. However, the fact that Castile is now a region subsumed within modern Spain has been the decisive factor in the preferential usage of \"español\" in an international context.\n\n\n\n\nSome philologists use \"Castilian\" only for the language spoken in Castile during the Middle Ages and state that it is preferable to use \"Spanish\" for its modern form. The dialect of Spanish spoken in northern parts of modern Castile may also be called \"Castilian.\" It differs from those of other regions of Spain (Andalusia for example); the Castilian dialect is conventionally considered in Spain to be the same as Standard Spanish.\n\nAnother use of \"Castilian\" in English is to distinguish between Standard Spanish and regional dialects. As noted above, the distinction is made to some extent in Spanish but not as far as some English-speakers go; for example, websites with language selection screens give the choice between \"Castilian Spanish\" and \"Latin American Spanish\", among other languages.\n\nIn the Americas, where Spanish is the native language of 20 countries, usage of \"castellano\" and \"español\" is sometimes reversed to refer to another nation. For example, a Peruvian talking about a Uruguayan might say, \"Yo hablo en español peruano, él habla en español uruguayo, pero los dos hablamos castellano\" (\"I speak Peruvian Spanish, he speaks Uruguayan Spanish, but we both speak Castilian\"). That usage comes from the historical association of \"español\" with the language that was brought to America by conquistadores and was later transformed in each nation through daily usage, with \"castellano\" as the basis for all variants.\n\n\n"}

The symbol's names and phonetic descriptions are described in the \"Handbook of the International Phonetic Association\". The symbols also have nonce names in the Unicode standard. In some cases, the Unicode names and the IPA names do not agree. For example, IPA calls \"epsilon\", but Unicode calls it \"small letter open E\".\n\nThe traditional names of the Latin and Greek letters are used for unmodified symbols. In Unicode, some of the symbols of Greek origin have Latin forms for use in IPA; the others use the symbols from the Greek section.\n\nExamples:\nNote\nThe IPA standard includes some small capital letters, such as , although it is common to refer to these symbols as simply \"capital\" or \"cap\" letters, because the IPA standard does not include any full-size capital letters.\n\nA few letters have the forms of cursive or script letters. Examples:\nNote\nLigatures are called precisely that, although some have alternate names. Examples:\n\nMany letters are \"turned\", or rotated 180 degrees. Examples:\n\nA few letters are \"reversed\" (flipped on a vertical axis):\nOne letter is \"inverted\" (flipped on a horizontal axis): ' \"inverted capital small R\". (' could also be called an \"inverted w\", but \"turned w\" is more common.)\n\nWhen a horizontal stroke is added, it is called a \"crossbar\": ' \"barred h\", ' \"barred o\", ' \"reversed barred glottal stop\" or \"barred ayin\", ' \"barred dotless j\" or \"barred gelded j\" (apparently never 'turned f'), \"double-barred pipe\", etc.\n\nswyat\" through it: \"slashed o\".\n\nThe implosives have \"hook\" tops: ' \"hook-top b\", as does ' \"hook-top h\".\n\nSuch an extension at the bottom of a letter is called a \"tail\". It may be specified as \"left\" or \"right\" depending on which direction it turns: ' \"right-tail n\", ' \"right-tail turned r\", ' \"left-tail n\", ' \"tail z\" (or just \"retroflex z\"), etc. But note: ' \"eng\" or \"engma\", ' \"meng\", \"heng\".\n\nWhen the tail loops over itself, it's called \"curly\": ' \"curly-tail j\", ' \"curly-tail c\".\n\nThere are also a few unique modifications: ' \"belted l\", ' \"closed reversed epsilon\" (there was once also a ' \"closed omega\"), ' \"right-leg turned m\", ' \"turned long-leg r\" (there was once also a \"long-leg r\"), ' \"double pipe\", and the obsolete \"stretched c\".\n\nSeveral non-English letters have traditional names: ' \"c cedilla\", ' \"eth\" (also spelled \"edh\"), ' \"engma\" or \"eng\", ' \"schwa\" (also spelled \"shwa\"), ' \"exclamation mark\", ' \"pipe\".\n\nOther symbols are unique to the IPA, and have developed their own quirky names: ' \"fish-hook r\", ' \"ram's horns\", ' \"bull's eye\", ' \"esh\" (apparently never 'stretched s'), ' \"ezh\" (sometimes confused with \"yogh\"), ' \"hook-top heng\".\n\nThe is usually called by the sound it represents, \"glottal stop\".

{"id": "38178707", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38178707", "title": "National Monuments Council (South Africa and Namibia)", "text": "National Monuments Council (South Africa and Namibia)\n\nThe National Monuments Council (NMC) was the national heritage conservation authority of South Africa, and therefore also of Namibia, during the major part of the apartheid era. It was the successor body to the Historical Monuments Commission and became known principally for its declaration of several thousand national monuments. It came into being through the promulgation of the National Monuments Act of 1969 and ceased to exist on 31 March 2000 when it was replaced by SAHRA and the provincial heritage resources authorities established in terms of the National Heritage Resources Act of 1999.\n\nThe National Monuments Council was the successor to the Historical Monuments Commission which had been in existence since 1923 and upon its creation the 'historical monuments' declared by the Commission became known as 'national monuments'. Like its predecessor it was a statutory body, semi-independent of government and presided over by a council appointed by the Minister responsible for culture. It had its head office in Cape Town rather than the national capital Pretoria. This reflected its preoccupation with the heritage of the early colonial (Dutch) period, the area around Cape Town being the most densely colonised during that time and hence the area in which most remnants of Dutch colonialism in South Africa are located. This is borne out by the fact that around half of the national monuments declared by the NMC were located in what is now the Western Cape Province.\n\nMost of the period of existence the NMC fell within the apartheid era. During this period the organisation was governed by a Council made up exclusively of white South Africans and had a professional staff of similar composition. However, from not long after PW Botha's introduction of the Tricameral Parliament in 1984 the membership of the Council included one representative from each of the Coloured and Indian communities. During the de Klerk era (1989–1994) the organisation began to shift focus and declared a number of sites important to the history of the African community, including those associated with anti-apartheid movements, commencing with the declaration of the Sol Plaatje House in Kimberley in 1992.\n\nFrom 1994, under the post-Apartheid government, the make-up and focus of the organisation began to change to reflect the changes in South African society. During this period the composition of the Council and professional staff came to reflect the demographics of the country and a concerted effort was made to declare sites that reflected a broader national heritage.\nAt the end of March 2000 the National Monuments Council was replaced by the South African Heritage Resources Agency, SAHRA, and over the following years the establishment of provincial heritage resources authorities saw the shift of the majority of its functions to provincial level. In terms of Section 58 of the National Heritage Resources Act national monuments became the responsibility of provincial heritage resources authorities and are now known as provincial heritage sites. A new category of national heritage site was created and is the responsibility of SAHRA.\n\nIn 1990, when the territory of South West Africa became Namibia, the National Monuments Act remained in force and a National Monuments Council was established for the newly independent country. This organisation continued to operate until the promulgation of the Namibian Heritage Act of 2004 in terms of which the National Heritage Council was established.\n\nThe most noticeable legacy of the National Monuments Council is the bronze badge which still adorns most provincial heritage sites in South Africa and heritage places in Namibia. The term 'national monument' is still used by most South Africans and Namibians to refer to anything protected in terms of heritage legislation.\n\nMore fundamental inheritances of present heritage resources authorities are:\n\nThe logo of the National Monuments Council was almost the same as that used by its predecessor the Historical Monuments Commission. It depicts the entrance gate of the Cape Town Castle (the first historical monument to be declared by the Commission) surrounded by a wreath of King Proteas (South Africa's national flower) and capped with the national coat of arms that was used between 1910 and 2000. The only change from the Historical Monuments Commission period is the inclusion of a padrão in the centre of the castle gateway, a symbol of the Portuguese 'discovery' of Africa and apparently symbolic of the inclusion of South West Africa (now Namibia) within the area of jurisdiction of the organisation.\n\nThe Head Office of the National Monuments Council was in Cape Town and for most of its existence was the only base from which the organisation operated.\nFrom the mid-1980s 'regional offices' were established. The first was in Pretoria to service the then Transvaal province and thereafter in the other two provinces of the time, the Orange Free State (Bloemfontein) and Natal (initially Durban, but later Pietermaritzburg) provinces. The Cape Province came to be served by regional offices in Cape Town (Western Cape), Kimberley (Northern Cape) and Grahamstown (Eastern Cape). An office was also established in Windhoek, the capital of the South African governed territory of South West Africa.\nFollowing the establishment of nine provinces in 1994 the boundaries of the regions served were brought into line with those of provinces and over the next few years what were now called 'provincial offices' were established in those provinces that did not yet have an office. With the coming into effect of the National Heritage Resources Act in 1999, the records and in some cases staff of these offices were taken over by provincial heritage resources authorities.\n\nThe National Monuments Council received the bulk of its funds as a transfer payment from the department of the Minister responsible for culture.

{"id": "156765", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=156765", "title": "Nüshu", "text": "Nüshu\n\nNüshu (), is a syllabic script derived from Chinese characters that was used exclusively among women in Jiangyong County in Hunan province of southern China. Nüshu has been included in the Unicode Standard since June 2017.\n\nUnlike the standard written Chinese, which is logographic (with each character representing a word or part of a word), Nüshu is phonetic, with each of its approximately 600-700 characters representing a syllable. This is about half the number required to represent all the syllables in Tuhua, as tonal distinctions are frequently ignored, making it \"the most revolutionary and thorough simplification of Chinese characters ever attempted\". Zhou Shuoyi, described as the only male to have mastered the script, compiled a dictionary listing 1,800 variant characters and allographs.\n\nIt have been suggested that, Nüshu characters appears to be an italic variant form of Kaishu Chinese characters, as can be seen in the name of the script, though some have been substantially modified to better fit embroidery patterns. The strokes of the characters are in the form of dots, horizontals, virgules, and arcs. The script is traditionally written in vertical columns running from right to left, but in modern contexts it may be written in horizontal lines from left to right, as is the case for Chinese. Unlike Chinese, Nüshu writers value characters written with very fine, almost threadlike, lines as a mark of fine penmanship.\n\nAbout half of Nüshu is modified Chinese characters used logographically. In about 100, the entire character is adopted with little change apart from skewing the frame from square to rhomboid, sometimes reversing them (mirror image), and often reducing the number of strokes. Another hundred have been modified in their strokes, but are still easily recognizable, as is \"nü\" 'woman' above. About 200 have been greatly modified, but traces of the original Chinese character are still discernible.\n\nThe rest of the characters are phonetic. They are either modified characters, as above, or elements extracted from characters. There are used for 130 phonetic values, each used to write on average ten homophonous or nearly homophonous words, though there are allographs as well; women differed on which Chinese character they preferred for a particular phonetic value.\n\nIt is not known when or how Nüshu came into being, but—because it is clearly based in the standard Chinese script, hanzi—Nüshu could not have been created before standardization of hanzi (circa 900). Many of the simplifications found in Nüshu had been in informal use in standard Chinese since the Song and Yuan dynasty (13th - 14th century). It seems to have reached its peak during the latter part of the Qing Dynasty (1644–1911).\n\nThough a local educated worker at the Jiangyong Cultural Office (Zhou Shuoyi) had collected, studied and translated many Nüshu texts into standard Chinese, he was unable to draw outside attention to the script until a report was submitted to the central government on this subject in 1983.\n\nDuring the latter part of the 20th century, owing more to wider social, cultural and political changes than the narrow fact of greater access to hanzi literacy, younger girls and women stopped learning Nüshu, and it began falling into disuse, as older users died. The script was suppressed by the Japanese during their invasion of China in the 1930s-40s, because they feared that the Chinese could use it to send secret messages., and also during China's Cultural Revolution (1966–76). The last original writers of the script died in the 1990s (the last one in 2004).\n\nIt is no longer customary for women to learn Nüshu, and literacy in Nüshu is now limited to a few scholars who learned it from the last women who were literate in it. However, after Yang Yueqing made a documentary about Nüshu, the government of the People's Republic of China started to popularize the effort to preserve the increasingly endangered script, and some younger women are beginning to learn it.\n\nYang Huanyi, an inhabitant of Jiangyong county, Hunan province and the last person proficient in this writing system, died on September 20, 2004, age 98.\n\nThe language and locale have attracted foreign investment building up infrastructure at possible tourist sites and a $209,000 grant from the Ford Foundation to build a Nüshu museum scheduled to open in 2007. However, with the line of transmission now broken, there are fears that the features of the script are being distorted by the effort of marketing it for the tourist industry.\n\nChinese composer Tan Dun has created a multimedia symphony entitled \"Nu Shu: The Secret Songs of Women\" for Harp, Orchestra, and 13 microfilms. Tan Dun spent 5 years conducting field research in Hunan Province, documenting on film the various songs the women use to communicate. Those songs become a 3rd dimension to his symphony, and are projected alongside the orchestra and harp soloist.\n\nLisa See describes the use of Nüshu among 19th-century women in \"Snow Flower and the Secret Fan\".\n\nThe Nüshu script is used to write a distinct local Chinese variety known as Xiangnan Tuhua (湘南土話, 'Southern Hunanese Tuhua') that is spoken by the people of the Xiao River and Yongming River region of northern Jiangyong County, Hunan. This dialect, which differs enough from those of other parts of Hunan that there is little mutual intelligibility, is known to its speakers as \"Dong language.\" It is written only in the Nüshu script. There are differing opinions on the classification of Xiangnan Tuhua, as it has features of several different Chinese varieties. Some scholars classify it under Xiang Chinese or Pinghua and other scholars consider it a hybrid dialect. In addition to speaking Tuhua, most local people in Jiangyong are bilingual in the Hunan dialect of Southwestern Mandarin, which they use for communication with people from outside the area where Tuhua is spoken, as well as for some formal occasions. If Hunan Southwestern Mandarin is written, then it is always written using standard Chinese characters and not with the Nüshu script.\n\nJiangyong County has a mixed population of Han Chinese and Yao people, but Nüshu is used only to write the local Chinese dialect (Xiangnan Tuhua, 湘南土話), and there are no known examples of the script being used to write the local Yao language.\n\nA large number of the Nüshu works were \"third day missives\" (). They were cloth bound booklets created by laotong, \"sworn sisters\" () and mothers and given to their counterpart \"sworn sisters\" or daughters upon their marriage. They wrote down songs in Nüshu, which were delivered on the third day after the young woman's marriage. This way, they expressed their hopes for the happiness of the young woman who had left the village to be married and their sorrow for being parted from her.\n\nOther works, including poems and lyrics, were handwoven into belts and straps, or embroidered onto everyday items and clothing.\n\nNüshu is included in the Unicode Standard under the name \"Nushu\" (because Unicode character names, block names, and script names can only use ASCII letters). 396 Nüshu letters were added to the Nushu block as part of Unicode version 10.0 which was released in June 2017. An iteration mark for Nüshu, is in the Ideographic Symbols and Punctuation block.\n\nThe Unicode block for Nüshu is U+1B170–U+1B2FF:\n\n\n\n"}

At the time of Arthur's death, Cave was partway through recording sessions for \"Skeleton Tree\", the sixteenth studio album by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds.\n\n\"One More Time with Feeling\" documents the final production process of \"Skeleton Tree\", in the aftermath of the death of Nick Cave's son Arthur. The film includes 35 minutes of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds performing at Air Studios in London in early 2016 during the final recording sessions for the album, as well as director Andrew Dominiks interviews with Cave, band member Warren Ellis and Cave's wife Susie Bick. The film also features \"intermittent narration and improvised rumination\" from Cave throughout.\nPrincipal production for \"One More Time with Feeling\" started in February 2016 and the entire film was shot over the course of 10 days with a crew of seven people. The film was shot in both black and white and in color and in both 2D and 3D, with two specialist 3D technicians. Dominik originally intended to shoot the film as \"a performance based concept\", but it became \"something much more significant\" as he began conducting interviews during filming. The decision to conduct interviews and introduce non-musical elements was \"completely improvised\" by Dominik during principal production. Interviews with Nick Cave and Susie Bick were filmed in both London and Brighton.\n\nDominik and Cave had an agreement where Dominik could film at any time and ask Cave any question, provided that \"if there was anything [Cave] didn't like he could cut it out\". Several \"emotional\" scenes of the film were edited out due to Dominik's \"confusion [on] how to deal with the subject\" and for fear that they were \"exploitative in some way\". The portions of the film featuring Cave's narration and voiceovers were recorded on his iPhone after filming was completed. Several hours of his personal recordings were sent to Dominik via Dropbox; Dominik edited the recordings and \"built sequences around pieces\" of them.\n\nCave both commissioned and financed \"One More Time with Feeling\" himself in order to avoid conducting interviews about \"Skeleton Tree\" and his son's death with the media. According to Dominik, Cave was not expecting to profit from the film's release and \"his best hope [was] to break even.\"\n\nThe film's title was lifted from the lyrics of \"Magneto\", a song from Skeleton Tree.\n\n\"One More Time with Feeling\" premiered at the Venice Film Festival in Venice, Italy on 5 September 2016. It received a general worldwide release in 850 theatres on 8 September, the day before Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds released \"Skeleton Tree\". Originally intended to be a one-night-only event, additional screenings were added until 11 September due to demand in certain locations.\n\nA trailer for both the film and the album was released on 2 August, a month prior to its release.\n\n\"One More Time with Feeling\" received widespread critical acclaim. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 100%, based on 23 reviews, with an average rating of 9.0/10. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 92, based on 10 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\n\nFollowing its initial release on 8 September 2016 and the additional screenings added over the next four days due to demand in certain locations, \"One More Time with Feeling\" grossed £343,000 at the United Kingdom box office and $1.7 million worldwide.\n\nHome media\n\n\"One More Time with Feeling\" was released on DVD, Blu-ray and 3D Blu-ray on 3 March 2017.\n\n"}

While some signinum pavements have been found in Rome, the technique is not common there. Vitruvius describes the process of laying a floor, whether signinum or mosaic.

An auspicious time was chosen by astrologers to commence operations, and construction of these thrones was heralded by a royal ceremony to propitiate spirits. The thrones were simultaneously constructed according to a prescribed list of requirements, coated with resin, and decorated with gold leaf and glass mosaic.\n\nThe most important throne was the \"Lion Throne\" (\"Sīhāsanapallaṅka\"), which had a replica in the Hluttaw as well.\n\nThe thrones used different prescribed motifs and designs, types of wood, and were allocated to specific halls in the royal palace.

{"id": "227400", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=227400", "title": "Pathetic fallacy", "text": "Pathetic fallacy\n\nThe phrase pathetic fallacy is a literary term for the attributing of human emotion and conduct to things found in nature that are not human. It is a kind of personification that occurs in poetic descriptions, when, for example, clouds seem sullen, when leaves dance, or when rocks seem indifferent. The British cultural critic John Ruskin coined the term in his book, \"Modern Painters\" (1843–60).\n\nRuskin coined the term \"pathetic fallacy\" to attack the sentimentality that was common to the poetry of the late 18th century, and which was rampant among poets including Burns, Blake, Wordsworth, Shelley, and Keats. Wordsworth supported this use of personification based on emotion by claiming that \"objects ... derive their influence not from properties inherent in them ... but from such as are bestowed upon them by the minds of those who are conversant with or affected by these objects.\" However Tennyson, in his own poetry, began to refine and diminish such expressions, and introduced an emphasis on what might be called a more scientific comparison of objects in terms of sense perception. The old order was beginning to be replaced by the new just as Ruskin addressed the matter, and the use of the pathetic fallacy markedly began to disappear. As a critic, Ruskin proved influential and is credited with having helped to refine poetic expression.\n\nThe meaning of the term has changed significantly from the idea Ruskin had in mind. Ruskin's original definition is \"emotional falseness\", or the falseness that occurs to one's perceptions when influenced by violent or heightened emotion. For example, when a person is unhinged by grief, the clouds might seem darker than they are, or perhaps mournful or perhaps even uncaring.\n\nThere have been other changes to Ruskin's phrase since he coined it: The particular definition that Ruskin used for the word \"fallacy\" has since become obsolete. The word \"fallacy\" nowadays is defined as an example of a flawed logic, but for Ruskin and writers of the 19th century and earlier, \"fallacy\" could be used to mean simply a \"falseness\". In the same way, the word \"pathetic\" simply meant for Ruskin \"emotional\" or \"pertaining to emotion\".\n\nSetting aside Ruskin's original intentions, and despite this linguistic 'rocky road', the two-word phrase has survived, though with a significantly altered meaning.\n\nIn his essay, Ruskin demonstrates his original meaning by offering lines of a poem:\n\n<poem>They rowed her in across the rolling foam—\nThe cruel, crawling foam...</poem>\n\nRuskin then points out that \"the foam is not cruel, neither does it crawl. The state of mind which attributes to it these characters of a living creature is one in which the reason is unhinged by grief\"—yet, Ruskin did not disapprove of this use of the pathetic fallacy:\n\nNow, so long as we see that the feeling is true, we pardon, or are even pleased by, the confessed fallacy of sight, which it induces: we are pleased, for instance, with those lines ... above quoted, not because they fallaciously describe foam, but because they faithfully describe sorrow.\n\nRuskin intended that pathetic fallacy may also refer to any \"untrue\" quality: as in the description of a crocus as \"gold\", when the flower is, according to Ruskin, saffron in color.\n\nThe following, a stanza from the poem \"Maud\" (1855) by Alfred Lord Tennyson, demonstrates what John Ruskin, in \"Modern Painters\", said was an \"exquisite\" instance of the use of the pathetic fallacy:\n\n<poem>\nMAUD\n\nThere has fallen a splendid tear\nShe is coming, my dove, my dear;\nThe red rose cries, \"She is near, she is near;\"\nThe larkspur listens, \"I hear, I hear;\"\n</poem>\n\nIn science, the term \"pathetic fallacy\" is used in a pejorative way in order to discourage the kind of figurative speech in descriptions that might not be strictly accurate and clear, and that might communicate a false impression of a natural phenomenon. An example is the metaphorical phrase \"Nature abhors a vacuum\", which contains the suggestion that nature is capable of abhorring something. There are more accurate and scientific ways to describe nature and vacuums.\n\nAnother example of a pathetic fallacy is the expression, \"Air hates to be crowded, and, when compressed, it will try to escape to an area of lower pressure.\" It is not accurate to suggest that air \"hates\" anything or \"tries\" to do anything. One way to express the ideas that underlie that phrase in a more scientific manner can be found and described in the kinetic theory of gases: effusion or movement towards lower pressure occurs because unobstructed gas molecules will become more evenly distributed between high- and low-pressure zones, by a flow from the former to the latter.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "34036629", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34036629", "title": "Postmodern marketing", "text": "Postmodern marketing\n\nPostmodern Marketing is a term derived from postmodern philosophical movements where there are cultural tendencies of inherent suspicion towards a global cultural narrative or meta-narrative. Postmodern marketing takes this same philosophical perspective and applies it to the way advertising initiatives are handled in the current post-World War II era. Postmodern marketing is approaching or has passed through a new era in advertising, branding, and strategic brand thinking. Postmodern marketing is inherently focused on customized experiences where broad market generalizations are no-longer applied or implemented on behalf of branded communications. Instead, the technique requires marketers to remove \"new aged adlandia\" trends and developments to focus on how the consumer prefers to be messaged to.\n\nAs a result, the ad aged \"art and science\" debate around creative, media, marketing and branding are put to an end. With a postmodern marketing approach a one-to-one communication is created between real humans, controlling real mouses, real computers, real keyboards and real mobile telephones.\n\nThe development of postmodern marketing is built on the foundations of modern marketing (with analysis, planning, implementation and control deeply rooted in its process). Postmodern marketing however, acts more of a collection of approaches in the need to stay nimble, reactive and able to engage and shift with consumers from a non-definitive point of view. Postmodern marketing saw great acceptance in the early 1990s with the emerging developments of the Splinternet and marketers realization that \"traditional\" strategic practices like Porters five forces, the Wheel of Retailing, and the Boston Matrix had become outdated and not able to keep up with or report on consumer media habits, creative tone, and umbrella branding techniques. As a result, postmodern marketing was born.\n\nAlthough the exact origins of the term is unknown, scholarly reports date the defining of the movement to the early 1990s by the \"European Journal of Marketing\" author Stephen Brown. According to his findings, postmodern marketing is made up of three distinct categories (1) the idea of change, new, and complex, (2) sub-discipline of consumer research, and (3) marketing practices and research methodologies. Furthermore, as Brown implies, one who approaches marketing from postmodern style should in many ways reject attempts to impost order and working in silos. Instead markers should work collectively from with \"artistic\" attributes of intuition, creativity, spontaneity, speculation, emotion and involvement.\n\nThe idea of change is a deeply rooted philosophy when studying postmodern marketing. When planning and strategizing within the \"new now\" or the \"new new now\" of media, technical services and creative styling a practitioner within the space must be comfortable with new and more complex systems and created worlds, platform and messaging structures. Fundamentally grounded on dramatic political and economic pressures the changing landscape illustrated the need to be nimble, direct and personalized communication and a high concern for personally identifiable information.\n\nTo adjust with shifts in consumer consumption habits, postmodern marketing has created new disciplines to better sample, survey and poll target consumer group to better align with habit, preference and beliefs. Many call this shift a \"naturalistic\" or interpretive\" approach, which mainly emerged from the control of non-renewable resources.\n\nOutcomes of redefined consumer research studies are newly defined approaches to marketing and media disciplines. Although some of these disciplines may be out dated, they illustrate core differences between postmodern marketing and modern marketing methodologies.\n\nThese approaches to marketing suggest that the role of a brand manager, digital agency, creative, media planner, account director, etc. is only defined by the company's culture that they in. Hence, a postmodern marketer is one who approaches marketing and advertising campaigns with a \"thinker marker\" mentality. Where they pull in and emphasize the need for creative relevance, companion media, collateral activation, social engagement, and most importantly have the means to pull it all together. Many believe that a postmodern marketing approach creates greater efficiencies, order, opportunity and a chance to gain real world insights from the perspective of the consumer. As a result, postmodern marketing like postmodernality stands as a transitory phase in 21st centuryvertising and has ushered in an era of styles and nimble techniques.\n\nPostmodern marketing is not the same as \"non-traditional\" or digital marketing. It is instead made up only of new aged media engagements brought about by the developments like that of the iPad.\n\nSocial media belongs to the young. According to Sean Carton writer of ClickZ, the idea of social media belonging to only the young is, \"Baloney\". With the accelerated growth of account activation amongst the 55+ age cohort according to leading marketing research firms like Forrester, eMarketer, comScore and Nielsen, the idea of social media belonging to only the young Republicans is an inaccurate statement of fact.\n\nAccording to many scholastic journals, postmodern marketing hinges on and has aided to the development of many changes to the current marketing model.

{"id": "41700249", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41700249", "title": "Shenkui", "text": "Shenkui\n\nShenkui is a culture bound syndrome native to China in which the individual suffers somatic symptoms with anxiety, believed to be caused by a loss of semen. And in Traditional Chinese Medicine, shen (kidney) is the reservoir of vital essence in semen (ching) and k’uei signifies deficiency. In simplified Chinese it is called 肾亏, Traditional Chinese 腎虧, and in pinyin Shènkuī.\n\nShenkui or shen-k'uei is one of several Chinese culture-bound syndromes locally ascribed to loss (or fear of loss) of Yang (Chinese: 陽). In Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shenkui is believed to result from a deficiency in yang, obtained through the loss of semen. Semen is believed to be \"lost\" through excessive sexual activity or masturbation, nocturnal emissions, \"white urine\" which is believed to contain semen, or other mechanisms. Symptoms within the Chinese diagnostic system include dizziness, backache, tiredness, weakness, insomnia, frequent dreams, and complaints of sexual dysfunction (such as premature ejaculation or impotence). From an ethnopsychiatric perspective, additional symptoms are preoccupation with sexual performance, potential semen loss, and bodily complaints which may be taken as symptoms of lost yang.\n\nLosing semen reduces Yang, causing an unbalance in the body. Nocturnal emissions, too much intercourse, and masturbation resulting in ejaculation lower the levels of semen, causing loss of Yang. Somatic symptoms may include body soreness, aches, lack of energy, fatigue, and possibly problems in sexual performance.\n\nA person suffering form Shenkui may endure body aches, dizziness, tiredness, inability to sleep, and sexual dysfunction, all for which no physical cause can explain.\n\nThe passing of semen too often is avoided because it is believed to be crucial to a person’s health and safety. It is believed to be life-threatening if too much semen is lost.\n\n\"Chinese martial artists that remained celibate through years and years of extensive training were believed to be most powerful, therefore maintaining the power of one’s vital essence.\"\n\nSymptoms include:\n\nChinese folk beliefs hold that the Yin (Chinese: 陰) represents femininity, slow, cold, wet, passive, water, the moon, and nighttime. And that Yang represents masculinity, fast, dry, hot, aggressive, fire, the sun, and daytime.\n\nLoss of yang would result in an abundance of Yin. It is also believed that if a case of Shenkui is severe enough, it could result in death. \nInformal or incomplete education about sexual health in China leaves a lot of room for folk beliefs to thrive. Often, advertisements support such beliefs to encourage use of traditional medicines. In Chinese folk beliefs, the loss of semen can cause imbalance in the body, leaving you with aches and pains and trouble performing.\n\nSpecific treatments are not mentioned. The affected person may go to a medical clinic that specializes in sexual health. If no medical problems are found, therapy may be used to help deal with stress, or anxiety medicines may be used.\n\nDisorders, who they affect, and how they affect are different within each culture. In order to diagnose someone, it is necessary to make the effort to understand their home culture. Whether it is a culture bound syndrome or not, a person’s background determines how they see and interpret their own symptoms and how it must be treated.\n\n"}
{"id": "14405771", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14405771", "title": "Speech science", "text": "Speech science\n\nSpeech science refers to the study of production, transmission and perception of speech. Speech science involves anatomy, in particular the anatomy of the oro-facial region and neuroanatomy, physiology, and acoustics.\n\nThe production of speech is a highly complex motor task that involves approximately 100 orofacial, laryngeal, pharyngeal, and respiratory muscles. Precise and expeditious timing of these muscles is essential for the production of temporally complex speech sounds, which are characterized by transitions as short as 10 ms between frequency bands and an average speaking rate of approximately 15 sounds per second. Speech production requires airflow from the lungs (respiration) to be phonated through the vocal folds of the larynx (phonation) and resonated in the vocal cavities shaped by the jaw, soft palate, lips, tongue and other articulators (articulation).\n\nRespiration is the physical process of gas exchange between an organism and its environment involving four steps (ventilation, distribution, perfusion and diffusion) and two processes (inspiration and expiration). Respiration can be described as the mechanical process of air flowing into and out of the lungs on the principle of Boyle's law, stating that, as the volume of a container increases, the air pressure will decrease. This relatively negative pressure will cause air to enter the container until the pressure is equalized. During inspiration of air, the diaphragm contracts and the lungs expand drawn by pleurae through surface tension and negative pressure. When the lungs expand, air pressure becomes negative compared to atmospheric pressure and air will flow from the area of higher pressure to fill the lungs. Forced inspiration for speech uses accessory muscles to elevate the rib cage and enlarge the thoracic cavity in the vertical and lateral dimensions. During forced expiration for speech, muscles of the trunk and abdomen reduce the size of the thoracic cavity by compressing the abdomen or pulling the rib cage down forcing air out of the lungs.\n\nPhonation is the production of a periodic sound wave by vibration of the vocal folds. Airflow from the lungs, as well as laryngeal muscle contraction, causes movement of the vocal folds. It is the properties of tension and elasticity that allow the vocal folds to be stretched, bunched, brought together and separated. During prephonation, the vocal folds move from the abducted to adducted position. Subglottal pressure builds and air flow forces the folds apart, inferiorly to superiorly. If the volume of airflow is constant, the velocity of the flow will increase at the area of constriction and cause a decrease in pressure below once distributed. This negative pressure will pull the initially blow open folds back together again. The cycle repeats until the vocal folds are abducted to inhibit phonation or to take a breath.\n\nIn a third process of speech production, articulation, mobile and immobile structures of the face (articulators) adjust the shape of the mouth, pharynx and nasal cavities (vocal tract) as the vocal fold vibration sound passes through producing varying resonant frequencies.\n\nThe analysis of brain lesions and the correlation between lesion locations and behavioral deficits were the most important sources of knowledge about the cerebral mechanisms underlying speech production for many years. The seminal lesion studies of Paul Broca indicated that the production of speech relies on the functional integrity of the left inferior frontal gyrus.\n\nMore recently, the results of noninvasive neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), provide growing evidence that complex human skills are not primarily located in highly specialized brain areas (e.g., Broca's area) but are organized in networks connecting several different areas of both hemispheres instead. Functional neuroimaging identified a complex neural network underlying speech production including cortical and subcortical areas, such as the supplementary motor area, cingulate motor areas, primary motor cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum.\n\nSpeech perception refers to the understanding of speech. The beginning of the process towards understanding speech is first hearing the message that is spoken. The auditory system receives sound signals starting at the outer ear. They enter the pinna and continue into the external auditory canal (ear canal) and then to the eardrum. Once in the middle ear, which consists of the malleus, the incus, and the stapes; the sounds are changed into mechanical energy. After being converted into mechanical energy, the message reaches the oval window, which is the beginning of the inner ear. Once inside the inner ear, the message is transferred into hydraulic energy by going through the cochlea, which is filled with fluid, and on to the Organ of Corti. This organ again helps the sound to be transferred into a neural impulse that stimulates the auditory pathway and reaches the brain. Sound is then processed in Heschl's gyrus and associated with meaning in Wernicke's area. As for theories of speech perception, there are a motor and an auditory theory. The motor theory is based upon the premise that speech sounds are encoded in the acoustic signal rather than enciphered in it. The auditory theory puts greater emphasis on the sensory and filtering mechanisms of the listener and suggests that speech knowledge is a minor role that’s only used in hard perceptual conditions.\n\nSpeech is transmitted through sound waves, which follow the basic principles of acoustics. The source of all sound is vibration. For sound to exist, a source (something put into vibration) and a medium (something to transmit the vibrations) are necessary.\n\nSince sound waves are produced by a vibrating body, the vibrating object moves in one direction and compresses the air directly in front of it. As the vibrating object moves in the opposite direction, the pressure on the air is lessened so that an expansion, or rarefaction, of air molecules occurs. One compression and one rarefaction make up one longitudinal wave. The vibrating air molecules move back and forth parallel to the direction of motion of the wave, receiving energy from adjacent molecules nearer the source and passing the energy to adjacent molecules farther from the source.\nSound waves have two general characteristics: A disturbance is in some identifiable medium in which energy is transmitted from place to place, but the medium does not travel between two places.\n\nImportant basic characteristics of waves are wavelength, amplitude, period, and frequency. Wavelength is the length of the repeating wave shape. Amplitude is the maximum displacement of the particles of the medium, which is determined by the energy of the wave. A period (measured in seconds) is the time for one wave to pass a given point. Frequency of the wave is the number of waves passing a given point in a unit of time. Frequency is measured in hertz (hz); (Hz cycles per second) and is perceived as pitch. Each complete vibration of a sound wave is called a cycle. Two other physical properties of sound are intensity and duration. Intensity is measured in decibels (dB) and is perceived as loudness.\n\nThere are two types of tones: pure tones and complex tones. The musical note produced by a tuning fork is called a pure tone because it consists of one tone sounding at just one frequency. Instruments get their specific sounds — their timbre — because their sound comes from many different tones all sounding together at different frequencies. A single note played on a piano, for example, actually consists of several tones all sounding together at slightly different frequencies.\n\n\n"}

The term is also used for similar coins, imitating Greek staters, minted elsewhere in ancient Europe.\n\nThe stater, as a Greek silver currency, first as ingots, and later as coins, circulated from the 8th century BC to AD 50. The earliest known stamped stater (having the mark of some authority in the form of a picture or words) is an electrum turtle coin, struck at Aegina that dates to about 700 BC. It is on display at the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris. \nAccording to Robin Lane Fox, the stater as a weight unit was borrowed by the Euboean stater weighing from the Phoenician shekel, which had about the same weight as a stater () and was also one fiftieth of a mina.\n\nThe silver stater minted at Corinth of weight was divided into three silver drachmae of , but was often linked to the Athenian silver didrachm (two drachmae) weighing . In comparison, the Athenian silver tetradrachm (four drachmae) weighed . Staters were also struck in several Greek city-states such as, Aegina, Aspendos, Delphi, Knossos, Kydonia, many city-states of Ionia, Lampsacus, Megalopolis, Metapontium, Olympia, Phaistos, Poseidonia, Syracuse, Thasos, Thebes and more.\nThere also existed a \"gold stater\", but it was only minted in some places, and was mainly an accounting unit worth 20–28 drachmae depending on place and time, the Athenian unit being worth 20 drachmae. (The reason being that one gold stater generally weighed roughly , twice as much as a drachma, while the parity of gold to silver, after some variance, was established as 1:10). The use of gold staters in coinage seems mostly of Macedonian origin. The best known types of Greek gold staters are the 28-drachma \"kyzikenoi\" from Cyzicus.\n\nCeltic tribes brought the concept to Western and Central Europe after obtaining it while serving as mercenaries in north Greece. Gold staters were minted in Gaul by Gallic chiefs modeled after those of Philip II of Macedonia, which were brought back after serving in his armies, or those of Alexander and his successors. Some of these staters in the form of the Gallo-Belgic series were imported to Britain on a large scale. These went on to influence a range of staters produced in Britain. British Gold staters generally weighed between .\n\nCeltic staters were also minted in present-day Czech Republic and Poland. The conquests of Alexander extended Greek culture east, leading to the adoption of staters in Asia. Gold staters have also been found from the ancient region of Gandhara from the time of Kanishka.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1347463", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1347463", "title": "The Death of Klinghoffer", "text": "The Death of Klinghoffer\n\nThe Death of Klinghoffer is an American opera, with music by John Adams to an English-language libretto by Alice Goodman. First produced in Brussels and New York in 1991, the opera is based on the hijacking of the passenger liner \"Achille Lauro\" by the Palestine Liberation Front in 1985, and the hijackers' murder of 69-year-old Jewish-American passenger Leon Klinghoffer, who was wheelchair bound.\n\nThe concept of the opera originated with theatre director Peter Sellars, who was a major collaborator, as was choreographer Mark Morris. It was commissioned by five American and European opera companies, and the Brooklyn Academy of Music.\n\nThe opera has generated controversy, including allegations by Klinghoffer's two daughters and others that the opera is antisemitic and glorifies terrorism. The work's creators and others have disputed these criticisms.\n\nTheatre director Peter Sellars developed the concept of this opera and was a major collaborator, as was choreographer Mark Morris. The opera was originally commissioned through a consortium of six entities: the Brussels opera company La Monnaie, the San Francisco Opera, the Opéra de Lyon in France, the Los Angeles Festival (separate from that city's opera company), the Glyndebourne Festival in England, and the Brooklyn Academy of Music.\n\nThe first performance took place at the Théatre Royal de la Monnaie, Brussels, Belgium, on March 19, 1991, directed by Sellars. The next month, the Lyon premiere took place. This was followed by a Nonesuch studio recording in that French city with the same cast.\n\nThe first US performance was at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on September 5, 1991.\n\nControversy ensued. An opening scene depicting a suburban family, the Rumors, was permanently cut from the score on grounds that it caused offense. The Nonesuch recording, released in 1992, does not include this music. Because of the reaction to the subject matter and philosophy of the opera, planned stagings at Glyndebourne and in Los Angeles were cancelled.\n\nWhen the original production was staged by San Francisco Opera in November 1992, the Jewish Information League mounted protests. The first staging in Germany took place in 1997 in Nürnberg, followed by a second German production at the Opernhaus Wuppertal in 2005.\n\nAnother European production was given in February 2001, in Helsinki at Finnish National Opera. The first complete UK performance was a 2002 concert in London by the BBC Symphony Orchestra. Penny Woolcock directed a British television version of the opera, in revised form, for Channel 4, with the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Adams; its soundtrack was made in 2001, the telecast aired in 2003, and a DVD was released on Decca in 2004. The first Australasian performance took place in February 2005 at the Auckland Festival, New Zealand. The first fully staged UK production was given in August 2005 at the Edinburgh Festival by Scottish Opera.\n\nThe opera received a new production at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in December 2003. The Curtis Institute of Music, through its Curtis Opera Theatre and Curtis Symphony Orchestra, gave a performance in Philadelphia in February 2005. Four years later, students at the Juilliard Opera Center performed a semi-staged concert version with Adams conducting.\n\n\"The Death of Klinghoffer\" received its second full American staging in June 2011 at Opera Theatre of Saint Louis, conducted by Michael Christie, directed by James Robinson, and starring Christopher Magiera as the Captain and Brian Mulligan as Klinghoffer. The opera received its first London production on February 25, 2012, starring Alan Opie as Klinghoffer and Christopher Magiera as the Captain, conducted by Baldur Brönnimann and staged by Tom Morris at the English National Opera, in a co-production with the Metropolitan Opera. In June 2014, the Met's general manager Peter Gelb announced that after discussions with the Anti-Defamation League the planned Live in HD transmission of the production would be cancelled. The opera was set for seven performances at the Met in October and November 2014.\n\nAfter being dropped from production by the Los Angeles Opera, the opera received its Los Angeles area premiere in March 2014 with Long Beach Opera, conducted by Andreas Mitisek and staged by James Robinson.\n\nThe prologue consists of two choruses, the \"Chorus of Exiled Palestinians\" and the \"Chorus of Exiled Jews\", each of which is a general reflection about the respective peoples and their history.\n\n\"Scene 1\"\n\nThe unnamed captain of the \"MS Achille Lauro\" recalls the events of the hijacking. Prior to that, most of the passengers had disembarked in Egypt for a tour of the Pyramids, and the ship set out to sea to return later for the touring passengers. The hijackers had boarded during the disembarkation. When the hijackers commandeer the ship, the passengers still on board are collected in the ship's restaurant. The narrative shifts to a Swiss grandmother, traveling with her grandson while the boy's parents are touring the pyramids. The ship's first officer, given the fictitious name of Giordano Bruno, informs the Captain that terrorists are on the ship and one waiter has been wounded. The Captain and First Officer try to keep the passengers calm. Molqi, one of the hijackers, explains the situation to the passengers at gunpoint. The Captain and Molqi have an encounter, where the Captain orders food and drink to be brought, and offers to let Molqi choose the food for the Captain to eat.\n\n\"Scene 2\"\n\nFollowing the \"Ocean Chorus\", another hijacker, Mamoud, keeps guard over the Captain. Mamoud recalls his youth and songs he listened to on the radio. The Captain and Mamoud have a dialogue, in which the Captain pleads that individuals on the two sides of the Palestinian–Israeli conflict could meet and try to understand each other. Mamoud dismisses this idea. During this scene is a passenger narrative by the Austrian Woman, who locked herself in her cabin and remained hidden throughout the hijacking. Act 1 ends with the \"Night Chorus.\"\n\nThe \"Hagar Chorus\", relating to the Islamic story of Hagar and the Angel and the Biblical story of Hagar and Ishmael is sung. It represents the beginnings of Arab–Israeli tension, of which the hijacking is one historical result.\n\n\"Scene 1\"\n\nMolqi is frustrated that he has received no reply to his demands. Mamoud threatens all of the passengers with death. Leon Klinghoffer sings, saying that he normally likes to avoid trouble and live simply and decently, but going on to denounce the hijackers. Another hijacker, called \"Rambo\", responds in harsh terms about Jews and Americans. The passenger, the British Dancing Girl, recalls how well the fourth hijacker, Omar, treated her and the other passengers, for example, letting them have cigarettes. Omar sings of his desire for martyrdom for his cause. At the end of the scene, Omar and Molqi have a dispute, and Molqui takes Klinghoffer away. The \"Desert Chorus\" follows.\n\n\"Scene 2\"\n\nMarilyn Klinghoffer talks about disability, illness, and death. She thinks that her husband Leon was taken to the ship's hospital, but he was shot, off-stage. The hijackers have ordered the Captain to say they will kill another passenger every fifteen minutes. Instead, the Captain offers himself as the sole next person to be killed. Molqi appears and says that Leon Klinghoffer is dead. The \"Aria of the Falling Body (Gymnopédie)\", sung by Klinghoffer, follows.\n\nThe \"Day Chorus\" links scene 2 to scene 3.\n\n\"Scene 3\"\n\nAfter the hijackers have surrendered and the surviving passengers have disembarked safely in port, the Captain remains to tell Marilyn Klinghoffer about her husband's death. She reacts with sorrow and rage toward the Captain, for what she sees as his accommodation of the hijackers. Her final sentiment is that she wished that she could have died in her husband's place.\n\nThe general style of the opera's music resembles that of Adams' minimalist music period, in the vein also of music by Philip Glass and Steve Reich. Intervallic relationships such as \"affekt\" are used to evoke certain emotions. The drama is portrayed primarily in long monologues by individual characters, with commentary by the chorus, which does not take part in the action.\n\nBoth Adams and Sellars have acknowledged the affinity of the opera's dramatic structure to the sacred oratorios of Johann Sebastian Bach, in particular his \"Passions\". The plot of the opera does not contain a detailed re-enactment of the events of the hijacking and the murder of Klinghoffer; the major events are not directly portrayed on stage and occur between the opera's staged scenes. The artists originally considered the opera as more of a \"dramatic meditation\" or \"reflection\", in the manner of an oratorio, rather than a conventional narrative opera driven by plot.\n\nBased on this aspect, the opera has been criticized as undramatic and static, particularly in act 1, whereas act 2 is more \"conventional\" in terms of operatic narrative. In defence of this unconventional structure, John Ginman has analysed the particular dramaturgy and structure of the opera.\n\nThe opera's choral passages have been performed and recorded separately as \"Choruses from Klinghoffer\".\n\nControversy surrounded the American premiere and other productions in the years which followed. Some critics and audience members condemned the production as antisemitic and appearing to be sympathetic to the hijackers. Adams, Goodman, and Sellars repeatedly claimed that they were trying to give equal voice to both Israelis and Palestinians with respect to the political background.\n\nLisa Klinghoffer and Ilsa Klinghoffer, the daughters of Leon and Marilyn Klinghoffer, anonymously attended the 1991 U.S. premiere of the opera in New York City. Afterward the Klinghoffer family released the following statement about the opera: \"We are outraged at the exploitation of our parents and the coldblooded murder of our father as the centerpiece of a production that appears to us to be anti-Semitic.\"\n\nThe dramatic expression of Palestinian historical grievances in a theatrical context generated some criticism of the opera's alleged sympathy with Palestinian terrorism. Others accused the creators of anti-Semitism for their portrayal of fictional Jewish-American neighbours of the Klinghoffers, the Rumors, in a scene in the original version. The couple were characterized in a way many Jews believed to be offensive and inappropriately satirical. \"New York Times\" theater critic Edward Rothstein was particularly scathing in describing the scene and its place in the play; he described it as expressing \"scorn of American Jews and anybody else without mythic claims on the world's attention\" while eliminating altogether the Israeli position, asking rhetorically \"Who could tell from this work just what the Jewish side really isa sort of touristy attachment to an ancient land?\" Following the American premiere, Adams deleted this scene, while revising his opera for all future productions.\n\nFollowing the September 11 attacks, the Boston Symphony Orchestra cancelled a scheduled performance in November 2001 of extracts from the opera. This was partly in deference to a member of the Tanglewood Festival Chorus, who lost a family member on one of the hijacked planes, as well as due to perceptions that the work was overly sympathetic to terrorists. In a widely discussed \"New York Times\" article, Richard Taruskin defended the orchestra's action. He denounced Adams and the opera for \"romanticizing terrorists\". John Rockwell of \"The New York Times\", in a review of the Penny Woolcock film version, countered that the opera ultimately \"shows unequivocally that murder is nothing more than that, vicious and unconscionable.\"\n\nAdams responded to Taruskin's criticisms on a number of occasions, including this 2004 statement:\nNot long ago our attorney general, John Ashcroft, said that anyone who questioned his policies on civil rights after September 11 was aiding terrorists; what Taruskin said was the aesthetic version of that. If there is an aesthetic viewpoint that does not agree with his, it should not be heard. I find that very disturbing indeed.\n\nIn a more academic analysis, musicologist Robert Fink countered Taruskin's accusations of antisemitism, with particular reference to the deleted scene with the Rumor family. Fink has discussed how the removal of this scene disrupted the original dramaturgical structure of the opera, as the singers of the members of the Rumor family took on symbolically ironic later roles in the opera. Fink further posited that the reaction of American audiences to the portrayal of the Rumor family was partly because it was sociologically accurate. He discussed the scene in the historical context of past depictions in American popular culture of Jewish-American families. A separate academic study by Ruth Sara Longobardi discusses the opera with respect to issues about depictions of Palestinians and Jews. She explores how the use of contemporary media in productions, such as the Penny Woolcock film of the opera, affects perception of the two sides of the political conflict.\n\nThe 2009 Juilliard performance generated renewed controversy. A letter to \"The Juilliard Journal\" protested the opera as \"a political statement made by the composer to justify an act of terrorism by four Palestinians.\" The school's president, Joseph W. Polisi, responded with his own letter, stating that he was \"a longtime friend of Israel and have visited the country on numerous occasions\", as well as a recipient of the King Solomon Award from the America-Israel Cultural Foundation. He described \"Klinghoffer\" as \"a profoundly perceptive and human commentary on a political/religious problem that continues to find no resolution.\" He added that Juilliard and other institutions \"have to be responsible for maintaining an environment in which challenging, as well as comforting, works of art are presented to the public.\"\nIn June 2014, the Metropolitan Opera in New York cancelled an international simulcast and radio broadcast of this opera due to \"an outpouring of concern\" locally that it \"might be used to fan global anti-semitism.\" In addition to cancelling both broadcasts, the company agreed to include a statement from Klinghoffer's daughters in the printed program of the production. Peter Gelb, general manager for the Met, stated:\n\nIn an official statement, Adams said: \"The cancellation of the international telecast is a deeply regrettable decision and goes far beyond issues of 'artistic freedom,' and ends in promoting the same kind of intolerance that the opera's detractors claim to be preventing.\"\n\nIn a September 2014 \"New York\" magazine piece, critic Justin Davidson denied that \"The Death of Klinghoffer\" was anti-Semitic or glorified terrorism, stating that the title character is \"the opera's moral core, the one fully functioning human being.\" He described the opera as \"imperfect\" and \"politically troubling\", writing that its attempt to show the historical justifications for both sides is both needlessly provocative and hampers the drama: \"Explaining historical events is not an opera's job, and never has been. [...] What matters is how vast events frame a human drama, translated into musical form.\" He also said that the decision to model the opera on the Bach \"Passions\" \"might actually be the most offensive thing about the opera, since a Jewish murder victim is conscripted to serve as a Christian symbol of redemption.\"\n\nFirst Amendment expert Floyd Abrams wrote in October 2014 that, though there were no First Amendment issues: \"the killers ... chose to commit their crime. So did Lee Harvey Oswald, James Earl Ray and Osama bin Laden. We can expect no arias to be sung in their defense at the Metropolitan Opera, and there is no justification for any to be sung for the Klinghoffer killers.\"\n\nFormer New York City mayor and opera fan Rudy Giuliani wrote that while the Met had a First Amendment right to present the opera, \n\"Equally, all of us have as strong a First Amendment right to ... warn people that this work is both a distortion of history and helped, in some ways, to foster a three decade long feckless policy of creating a moral equivalency between the Palestinian Authority, a corrupt terrorist organization, and the state of Israel, a democracy ruled by law.\"American writer and feminist Phyllis Chesler, an opera aficionado, conceded the legal and artistic right to perform the opera, but claimed that it \"beatifies terrorism, both musically and in the libretto.\"\n\nIn support of the production, Oskar Eustis, the artistic director of the \"Public Theater\" said: \"It is not only permissible for the Met to do this piece – it's required for the Met to do the piece. It is a powerful and important opera.\"\n\n"}

Bass, first published in 1974. It is the sequel to \"Half Past Human\". The book was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1974. The novel deals with genetic and biological inventions with a strange and mystical twist.\n\n\"The Godwhale\" presents a view of a far-future Earth in which almost all non-human life has been exterminated due to rampant overpopulation, and most human beings have been transformed into weak, docile, diminutive creatures via genetic engineering and extensive reliance on automation and artificial intelligence. Bass utilizes extensive biochemical and medical terminology in the narrative, and many scenes are quite clinically graphic. It is a cautionary tale on the evolution of technological society, and was published during the emergent period of the US environmental movement.\n\nThe protagonist, Larry Dever, is gravely injured resulting in a radical surgical procedure, a hemicorporectomy, in which tissue below the waist is removed. He is outfitted with a set of intelligent mechanical legs, a \"manniquin\", and is placed into suspended animation until the damaged tissue can be restored. He wakes at a time when cloning technology can replace his legs, although for a price. Years before he was awakened, a clone, or \"bud child\", was created and is now a thriving young boy without language. Horrified by the prospect of his child being sacrificed to provide him with a new lower body, Larry opts to return to suspended animation. His child, Dim Dever, is selected by the guiding world computer, called Olga, to carry his ancient genes to a possible new colony on a planet orbiting Procyon.\n\nLarry awakens again in a nightmare future. Far from the highly advanced past, now an enormous human population (possibly in the trillions) covers every inch of the planet. Technology and science have degraded, and all freely breeding species have been exterminated. The 'Hive' or human population within its computer-supported subterranean culture ruthlessly hunts, kills, and recycles anyone who does not conform.\n\nAs Larry is trying to adapt to his new life, without most of his own body or his \"cyber\" torso, something re-awakens an ancient, half-derelict cyborg, the Godwhale of the title. This enormous 'rake' is an ocean-going biota harvester built in part from a genetically modified blue whale. Initially attempting to rejoin human civilization, the Godwhale (named Rorqual Maru or 'Whale Ship' in Japanese) eventually teams up with a genetically modified clone of Larry, Larry himself, and an assortment of misfits and refugees from the Hive.

He is considered one of the major forces advocating for legislation for occupational safety and health, as co-architect of Bismarck's social security and as a seminal figure in the relation of \"Diakonie\" and social politics.\n\nTheodor Lohmann was the seventh of eight children in a rural, patriarchal Lutheran household. From early on Lohmann had been influenced by the pious German Lutheran \"Great Awakening\" movement of Ludwig Harms, characterized by proselytism and sanctification. Lohmann's father, Ernst Heinrich Lohmann (1797–1856), was a merchant and owner of a brickyard. His mother, Johanna Juliana Lohmann (born Hardegen), died early. Theodor Lohmann attended the gymnasium in Celle.\n\nFrom 1850 he studied jurisprudence and political science at the University of Göttingen, where he also engaged in the study of church theory and came in contact with the \"Inner Mission\" for the first time, which led him to write his first thesis \"Communismus, Socialismus, Christenthum\". His thesis received a great deal of academic attention for its proposal of an extensive reform of society in the light of the newly emerging socialist theories. In 1851 he was one of the founders of the \"Burschenschaft\" \"Germania of Göttingen\". Four years later Lohmann entered the civil service of the Kingdom of Hanover. In 1858 he passed the second \"Staatsexamen\".\n\nSubsequently Lohmann was active in different roles for the royal administration of Hanover. In 1861 he was assigned to the administration's cultural department, and as general secretary in 1869 Lohmann participated in the first Evangelisch-Lutheran synod in Hanover. In the 1860s he had already engaged himself with the development of the Lutheran Inner Mission (Innere Mission), effectively reorganizing the constitution of the Hanover state church. Together with the theologian Gerhard Uhlhorn and others he played an important role in the establishment of the \"Evangelischer Verein\" (\"Evangelisch Association\") and the \"Stephansstift\", a diaconical institution of Hanover created in 1869 for the promotion of religious freedom. He was also involved in the assistance of youth and old people as well as vocational training. In 1862 Theodor Lohmann had married Louise Sophie Elisabeth Wyneken (1839–1879). The couple had three children.\n\nDuring the Austro-Prussian War the Kingdom of Hanover was occupied in 1866 by Prussian troops, and Hanover became a Prussian province. For the administrative lawyer Theodor Lohmann this presented a major fork in his career path: In 1871 Lohmann and his young family moved to Berlin and he assumed a position in the Prussian Ministry of Commerce, where he worked on matters concerning industrial workers. In this capacity he participated in the drafting of a number of bills, including the amendment of the German Trade, Commerce and Industry Regulation Act, which introduced factory inspection in Prussia, and formed the basis for the current-day \"Gewerbeaufsicht\" (\"industrial, commercial and business inspectorate\").\n\nFrom 1866 to 1873 Hermann Wagener, journalist, Conservative, Prussian and Reichstag deputy, and\nfriend of Bismarck was an official in the Prussian Ministry of State, and an important voice for reform. According to Hennock, Lohmann's role in the period after Wagener's departure is under reassessment by historians:\n\nIn 1880 Lohmann transferred to the Prussian Ministry of Interior. There he played a key staff role in support of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck during the passage of legislation that established the German social security system, the first system in the world based on principles of social insurance. Lohmann’s objectives, however, were distinct from Bismarck’s: Whereas the famous chancellor was interested in creating a social insurance that transformed the workers into dependent \"state pensioners\", or quiescent supporters of the Reich, Lohmann sought to broaden the workers' rights of self-determination and local self-governance. Bismarck’s concept of state socialism built upon a close linkage of the workers to the state contradicted Lohmann’s vision of the \"mündiger Arbeitnehmer\" (\"mature and responsible worker\"). While Bismarck sought to use the social insurance program to firm up the old order of the Prussian Junkers, Lohmann's German brand of Christian socialism sought the middle ground between the Junkers and the other defenders of the old order and the increasingly revolutionary ardor of the German workers.\n\nThose on Bismarck's side were not notably long on ideas about how to deal with what was widely known at the time as the Social Problem. \"Nothing illustrates the (Bismarck) government's lack of energy and imagination more strikingly than its approach to the working class,\" according to Gordon Craig. After the departure of his friend Wagener, the politically artful Bismarck seems to have turned to Lohmann and his associates in the bureaucracy for ideas.\n\nIn the end, however, the hopes of the reformers were simply not tolerable to Bismarck and his allies. Craig also writes:\n\nFor the Emperor, the attempt to apply Bismarck's (and Stumm-Halberg's) approach to the social problem, resulted in movement away from initial sympathy for the reform position toward an escalating rhetoric of violence that alarmed many of his servants, who believed his comments were undermining the stability of government. In the end, this approach proved self-defeating and the Reichstag unwilling to be stampeded into adopting anti-socialist legislation. The \"net effect was to embitter the working class and to deepen the gulf that existed between it and the rest of German society since 1878. This was unfortunate, since there were forces at work within the working class that might, if properly appreciated, have led to the kind of reconciliation that men like Naumann and Lohmann and Berlepsch were working for.\" \n\nBefore he was finally forced out following a confrontation with Bismarck, Lohmann had at least partial success in designing the state's public health insurance: Workers were allowed to participate in the financing and self-government of the health insurance companies. Despite Bismarck's opposition the traditional role of German ancillary health insurance funds and companies in the program was considerably strengthened. In 1883 the sociopolitical differences brought about a major schism between Lohmann and Bismarck and ended Lohmann’s role in reforming social insurance in Germany for seven years. The immediate cause of the rift was disagreement over provisions of accident insurance coverage. While Lohmann favored direct investment of the workers in the planned accident insurance program, Bismarck sought a compulsory insurance system in the form of mutual employer's liability insurance associations, which were to be subsidized by the state. For a while Lohmann tried to thwart Bismarck's plans. In September 1883 the issue came to a head in a confrontation between the two. As a result, Lohmann was removed from any further role in the formulation of this social legislation. Robert Bosse, the Director of the Ministry of the Interior at the time, noted in his memoirs:\n\nThe success of the 1884 law on the new accident insurance and the even greater success of the employer's liability insurance associations confirmed this assumption by Bosse and disproved Lohmann’s reservations at least partly. Lohmann himself said he was relieved that he no longer had to account for procedures, which he regarded \"wrong\" and \"completely impracticable\".\n\nLohmann left in 1883. Berlepsch held on, but eventually resigned in disgust in 1896. Others of their reform coalition faced similar fates.\n\nAs a result of his career in government, Daniel Rodgers, the Princeton historian whose \"Atlantic Crossings\" is a touchstone of transatlantic history puts Lohmann in the company of William Beveridge, the major intellectual architect of the postwar British welfare state, the Stockholm economists of the 1930s and Franklin D. Roosevelt's \"brain trust\" who shaped the New Deal. Rodgers terms Lohmann \"framer of Bismarck's initial social insurance proposals.\"\n\nAfter he left the Prussian administration Theodor Lohmann immersed himself in supporting the \"Inner Mission\" and traditional missionary work, among other things in the \"Gesellschaft zur Beförderung des Christentums unter den Juden\" (\"Society for the Advancement of Christianity among the Jews\"). He served as the society's president from 1876 to 1898. Lohmann also worked for the \"Gesellschaft zur Beförderung der evangelischen Missionen unter den Heiden\" (\"Society for the Advancement of the Evangelisch Missions among Unbelievers\"). In 1880 Lohmann had become a member of the \"Central-Ausschuß für die innere Mission der deutschen evangelischen Kirche\" (\"Central Committee for the Inner Mission of the German Evangelisch Church\"). He remained its member until his death in 1905.\n\nIn 1885 Lohmann wrote the report of the General Committee of the Inner Mission entitled \"Die Aufgabe der Kirche und inrer inneren Mission gegenüber den wirtschaftlichen und gesellschaftlichen Kämpfen \nder Gegenwart\" (The Function of the Church and its Internal Mission in relation\nto the Present Economic and Social Conflicts). According to Gordon Craig, this volume \"anticipated much that was to be said six years later in (Pope) Leo XIII's \"Rerum novarum\", and the outstanding Christian Social reformer of the next generation, Frederick Naumann.\n\nAfter Bismarck's departure from his position as German chancellor in 1890 Lohmann was reassigned by the new Minister of Trade, Hans Hermann of Berlepsch, to further extend the German worker legislation. One of his responsibilities during his first year was the planning and execution of the \"International Conference on Protection of Workers\" held in Berlin. He was subsequently involved in a further amendment of the German Trade, Commerce and Industry Regulation Act, which brought new improvements for the workers, e.g. the prohibition of nightwork for women and young people. After several promotions Lohmann was appointed director of the trade department in the Ministry of Trade in 1900. In 1904, on the occasion of his fiftieth anniversary of administrative service, he was presented with the \"Wilhelmsorden\", an award for special sociopolitical contributions.\n\nTheodor Lohmann died on August 31, 1905 at the age of seventy-three in Tabartz, Thuringia. Despite his substantial contributions to the German social security system and the protection of German workers, Lohmann and his social reforms remain to this day in the shadow of Bismarck and his politics.\n"}

While Israel is one of a small number of countries where a woman—Golda Meir—has served as Prime Minister, it is behind most Western countries in the representation of women in both the parliament and government.\n\n, women comprise 28% of Israel's 120-member Knesset. For comparison (as of 2004), the female ratio in the Arab world is 6.4%, in European Union average is 17.6% and in Scandinavia 40% \"and rising\". In the United States of America, women comprise only 19.3% of the House of Representatives. Female representation varies significantly by demographics: most female politicians have represented secular parties, while very few have come from Arab or religious Jewish parties.\n\nGolda Meir is the only woman to serve as the Prime Minister of Israel. She was chosen for the job just before the 1969 elections following the death of Levi Eshkol, and ended her job in 1974. She and Tzipi Livni are the only women who served as Foreign Affairs Ministers, Meir having served in the job for 10 years—from 1956 to 1966. Livni is the only woman to serve in the second most important job in the Israeli government, Vice Prime Minister.\n\nOnce Golda Meir resigned in 1974, it was another 12 years until another woman was appointed as a minister with a portfolio, when Shoshana Arbeli-Almozlino was appointed Health Minister, and 18 years until a woman was appointed to any other portfolio, Education Minister.\n\nAfter Golda Meir, the leading jobs which women held are as follows: Education Minister for a total of 9 years (5 of them by Limor Livnat, 3 years by Yuli Tamir and 1 year by Shulamit Aloni), and Minister of Communications, also for a total of 7 years (6 years by Shulamit Aloni and Limor Livnat, and 1 year by Dalia Itzik). Tzipi Livni was acting Minister of Justice for a month, and then Minister of Justice for almost a year and a half. Ayelet Shaked was appointed as Minister of Justice in 2015.\n\nAlthough a few women did succeed in reaching the leading posts in the Israeli government, a number of them hadn't ever been held by women, such as Defense Minister, Internal Security Minister, Finance Minister.\n\nFrom the first Israeli government until the 12th, Golda Meir was the only woman in the Israeli government (though not the parliament). Golda Meir, who started out as a secretary of the Women's Labour Council of Histadrut, and later became the head of the Jewish Agency for Israel's political department, and then an ambassador to the Soviet Union, came back to Israel in 1949 after she was elected to the Knesset, and served as the Israeli Minister of Labor. She held this job for 7 years under a number of Prime Ministers, until in 1956 she became Foreign Minister, a job she held for 10 years until 1966.\n\nAfter 3 years, in which she wasn't a member of the Israeli government, she was chosen as the head the Alignment party and as Prime Minister, and she was voted as Prime Minister again in the 1969 elections, when the party got the highest number of seats in the Knesset. Despite being a woman, she wasn't known as a Feminist, and she didn't appoint any other women to positions in the government.\n\nDuring Golda Meir's time, the number of woman members of Knesset was around 10–14 on average (out of 120), mostly from Mapai and its successor parties. In the elections during which Golda Meir was to become prime minister, only 8 women got into the Knesset.\n\nAfter the 1973 elections, Golda Meir resigned from her position as prime minister as the result of protests after the Yom Kippur War, and Yitzhak Rabin was chosen to succeed her. In 1974, he appointed Shulamit Aloni as a minister without portfolio. She held this position for 5 months, until she resigned in protest over the appointment of Yitzhak Rafael as the Religious Services Minister, despite the fact that he was suspected of having accepted bribes.\n\nIn 2015, the first Israeli political party dedicated to ultra-Orthodox women was unveiled, called \"B’Zhutan: Haredi Women Making Change.\"\n\n"}
