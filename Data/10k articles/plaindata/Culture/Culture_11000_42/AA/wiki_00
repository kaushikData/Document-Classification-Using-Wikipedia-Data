{"id": "2230235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2230235", "title": "Asian American studies", "text": "Asian American studies\n\nAsian American Studies is an academic discipline which critically examines the history, experiences, culture, and policies relevant to Asian Americans. It is closely related to other Ethnic Studies disciplines, such as African American Studies, Latino/a Studies, and Native American Studies. \n\nAsian American Studies appeared as a field of intellectual inquiry in the late 1960s as a result of strikes by the Third World Liberation Front, a group of students of color at San Francisco State University and at the University of California, Berkeley, which demanded that college classroom instruction include the histories of people of color in the United States told from their perspectives. The demand for Ethnic Studies was a critical response to the Eurocentric bias in university curriculum. As a result, a College of Ethnic Studies (the only such \"college\" at any American university at the time) became established at San Francisco State University with American Indian Studies, Asian American Studies, Africana Studies, and Latino/a Studies as its four units, and four ethnic studies programs became established at the University of California, Berkeley. The Association for Asian American Studies, a professional organization designed to promote teaching and research in the field, was established in 1979.\n\nDrawing from numerous disciplines such as sociology, history, literature, political science, and gender studies, Asian American Studies scholars consider a variety of perspectives and employ diverse analytical tools in their work. Unlike \"Asian\" Studies which focuses on the history, culture, religion, etc. of Asian people living in Asia, Asian American Studies is interested in the history, culture, experiences, of Asians living in the United States.\n\nAcademic programs in Asian American Studies provide students with the opportunity to examine the history of Asian-Americans, which includes topics such as immigration and race-based exclusion policies. \n\nAsian American Studies provides an academic avenue for addressing issues of racial oppression, capitalism at home, and imperialism abroad. \n\nThe discourse also includes studies on how first- and second-generation Asian Americans deal with adjustment and assimilation, especially on their Americanization and aggressive pursuit of higher education and prestigious occupations in a society that still discriminates against them.\n\nAsian American Studies focuses on the identities, historical and contemporary experiences of individuals and groups in the United States. Concepts and issues that are crucial to this interdisciplinary curriculum include: Orientalism, diaspora, Asian American masculinity, Asian American femininity, cultural politics, and media representation.\n\n\nMajor Asian American Studies programs in California include those at UC Berkeley, UC San Diego, UC Santa Barbara, UC Irvine, UC Davis, San Francisco State University (SFSU), California State University, Long Beach, California State University, Northridge, California State University, Fullerton, City College of San Francisco, University of Southern California, The Claremont Colleges, and at UCLA.\n\nOutside of California, major programs include University of Washington, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, University of Maryland, College Park, University of Colorado, Hunter College, Cornell University, Binghamton University, Duke University and Columbia University. Other rising programs include Arizona State University, New York University, Northwestern University, University of Pennsylvania and University of Minnesota. Currently, several universities, including University of North Carolina, University of Virginia, Syracuse University, and many others are in the process of developing Asian American Studies departments. \n\nMaster of Arts in Asian American Studies programs are available at UCLA and SFSU.\n\nAt the time of its founding in 1987, the Asian American Studies Program at Cornell University was the first such program in the Ivy League and on the east coast. Today it has four core faculty members in the humanities and social sciences in a variety of departments and colleges. This cross-college, university-wide position accommodates the extensive teaching and research interests of the Program's faculty and reflects the breadth of the vibrant field of Asian American Studies in general. In the classroom, in scholarship, and through campus and community advocacy, the Program is committed to examining the histories and experiences; identities, social and community formations; politics; and contemporary concerns of people of Asian ancestry in the United States and other parts of the Americas.\n\nOn the East Coast, the State University of New York at Stony Brook created an Asian & Asian American Studies Department after a 52 million dollar donation by Charles B. Wang (the founder of Computer Associates). The Charles B. Wang Center is designed as a vital space for multi-disciplinary and multicultural dialogues. The building was officially presented to Stony Brook University by Charles B. Wang on October 22, 2002. It was the largest single private gift ever received by the State University of New York 64-campus system. The Wang Center is used for conferences, art exhibits, film festivals, lectures, seminars, and performances. It is open to all Stony Brook students, faculty, and staff as well as the surrounding community.\n\nHunter College, City University of New York, located in the Upper East Side in Manhattan is home to the only Asian American Studies Program in the CUNY system. The program was established in 1993 through student and faculty activism, with Peter Kwong as the inaugural director. Despite offering the largest number of Asian American Studies courses in New York City, Hunter College does not have an Asian American Studies department nor does it offer an Asian American Studies major. In 2006, when the program was under threat of being cut, student activists formed The Coalition for the Revitalization of Asian American Studies at Hunter to fight to keep Asian American Studies. The students succeeded in saving the minor program, and they continue to fight for an Asian American Studies major and department. \n\nQueens College, City University of New York, located in the neighborhood of Flushing in New York City, is home to the Asian/American Center. It was established to conduct research with community needs in mind. It serves as a hub for research into Asian American issues, particularly focusing on the Asian diaspora in the New York area, and offers a minor in Asian American Community Studies (AACS).\n\n"}

It is a federally recognized historic district since 1985 and became a City of Atlanta Landmark District in 2006. Since 2000, the area has experienced an influx of residents and new businesses. The area, which is made up predominantly of Walker, Nelson and Peters Streets is home to a growing number of small art galleries, restaurants, coffee shops, and loft residences. Less than a mile from the historically black colleges and universities that make up the Atlanta University Center Consortium and from the expansive downtown campus of Georgia State University, the area also offers local shopping as well as spa services, like iwi Fresh. Other notable area eateries include No Mas! Cantina, a spacious Mexican-themed restaurant, bar and fine home furnishings establishment, often used as a point of reference. Castleberry Hill residents gather at local watering holes, such as Elliott Street Pub and Bottle Rocket.\n\nThe area in the city limits of Atlanta known today as Castleberry Hill was originally part of the renegade Snake Nation community that functioned during the 1850s. According to an article from Atlanta Magazine, Castleberry Hill was, by the mid-nineteenth century, a red-light district filled with prostitutes, gambling, and cockfighting. By the time the Civil War began, however, this area was in the process of industrialization. Items such as terra cotta and other building materials were produced then in Atlanta factories. Additionally, Castleberry Hill then contained cotton warehousing and grocers. One of those grocers was Daniel Castleberry, for whom the area was named. Daniel Castleberry, however, is believed to have been an established businessman in the area as a result of his winning the land in 1821 in a Georgia land lottery. By the early 1990s, the area had fallen on hard times, serving as the backdrop for dystopic films such as Freejack and Kalifornia.

By the early 21st century, however, Castleberry Hill began another renaissance with major motion pictures and TV series such as Walking Dead' being filmed in the area; the now well-known Castleberry Hill Art Stroll, which is held on the second Friday of each month, has become yet another popular event in this area.\n\n"}
{"id": "253747", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=253747", "title": "Chukchi language", "text": "Chukchi language\n\nChukchi is a Chukotko–Kamchatkan language spoken by the Chukchi people in the easternmost extremity of Siberia, mainly in Chukotka Autonomous Okrug. According to the Russian Census of 2002, about 7,700 of the 15,700 Chukchi people speak Chukchi; knowledge of the Chukchi language is decreasing, and most Chukchi now speak the Russian language (fewer than 500 report not speaking Russian at all).\n\nThe language is closely related to Koryak. Chukchi, Koryak, Kerek, Alutor, and Itelmen, form the Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages language family. There are many cultural similarities between the Chukchis and Koryaks, including economies based on reindeer herding. Both peoples refer to themselves by the endonym Luorawetlat (\"‘ԓыгъоравэтԓьат’\" ; singular Luorawetlan – \"‘ԓыгъоравэтԓьан’\" ), meaning \"the real people\". All of these peoples and other unrelated minorities in and around Kamchatka are known collectively as Kamchadals.\n\n\"Chukchi\" and \"Chukchee\" are anglicized versions of the Russian exonym \"Chukcha\" (plural \"Chukchi\"). This came into Russian from \"Čävča\", the term used by the Chukchis' Tungusic-speaking neighbors, itself a rendering of the Chukchi word \"‘чавчыв’\" , which in Chukchi means \"a man who is rich in reindeer\".\n\nIn the UNESCO Red Book, the language is on the list of endangered languages.\n\nMany Chukchis use the language as their primary means of communication both within the family and while engaged in their traditional pastoral economic activity (reindeer herding). The language is also used in media (including radio and TV translations) and some business activities. However, Russian is increasingly used as the primary means of business and administrative communication, in addition to behaving as a lingua franca in territories inhabited by non-Chukchis such as Koryaks and Yakuts. Over the past few decades, fewer and fewer Chukchi children have been learning Chukchi as a native language. Almost all Chukchis speak Russian, although some have a lesser command than others. Chukchi language is used as a primary language of instruction in elementary school; the rest of secondary education is done in Russian with Chukchi taught as a subject.\n\nA Chukchi writer, Yuri Rytkheu (1930–2008), has earned a measure of renown in both Russia and Western Europe, although much of his published work was written in Russian, rather than Chukchi.\n\nUntil 1931, the Chukchi language had no official orthography, in spite of attempts in the 1800s to write religious texts in it.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1900s, Vladimir Bogoraz discovered specimens of pictographic writing by the Chukchi herdsman Tenevil (see ). Tenevil's writing system was his own invention, and was never used beyond his camp. The first official Chukchi alphabet was devised by Bogoraz in 1931 and was based on the Latin script:\n\nIn 1937, this alphabet, along with all of the other alphabets of the non-Slavic peoples of the USSR, was replaced by a Cyrillic alphabet. At first it was the Russian alphabet with the addition of the digraphs \"К’ к’\" and \"Н’ н’\". In the 1950s the additional letters were replaced by \"Ӄ ӄ\" and \"Ӈ ӈ\". These newer letters were mainly used in educational texts, while the press continued to use the older versions. At the end of the 1980s, the letter \"Ԓ ԓ\" was introduced as a replacement for \"Л л\". This was intended to reduce confusion with the pronunciation of the Russian letter of the same form. The Chukchi alphabet now stands as follows:\n\nThere are no voiced stops in the language.\n\nThe vowels are , , , , , , and . and are pronounced identically but behave differently in the phonology. (Cf. the two kinds of in Inuit Eskimo, whose known cause is the merger of two vowels and , which are still separate in Yup'ik Eskimo.)\n\nA notable feature of Chukchi is its vowel harmony system largely based on vowel height. alternate with , respectively. The second group is known as \"dominant vowels\" and the first group as \"recessive vowels\"; that is because whenever a \"dominant\" vowel is present anywhere in a word, all \"recessive\" vowels in the word change into their \"dominant\" counterpart. The schwa vowel does not alternate but may trigger harmony as if it belonged to the dominant group.\n\nInitial and final consonant clusters are not tolerated, and schwa epenthesis is pervasive.\n\nStress tends to: 1. be penultimate; 2. stay within the stem; 3. avoid schwas.\n\nChukchi is a largely polysynthetic, agglutinative, direct-inverse language and has ergative–absolutive alignment. It also has very pervasive incorporation. In particular, the incorporation is productive and often interacts with other linguistic processes. Chukchi allows free incorporation of adjuncts, such as when a noun incorporates its modifier. However, besides the unusual use of adjuncts, Chukchi behaves in a very normal linguistic manner. The language of Chukchi also uses a specific verb system. The basic locative construction of a sentence in Chukchi contains a single locative verb, unlike many other languages.\n\nIn the \"nominals\", there are two numbers and about nine grammatical cases: absolutive, ergative, instrumental, locative, ablative, allative, orientative, two comitatives and a designative. Nouns are split into three declensions influenced by animacy: the first declension, which contains non-humans, has plural marking only in the absolutive case; the second one, which contains personal names and certain words for mainly older relatives, has obligatory plural marking in all forms; the third one, which contains other humans than those in the second declension, has optional plural marking. These nominal cases are used to identify the number of nouns, as well as their purpose and function in a sentence.\n\n\"Verbs\" distinguish three persons, two numbers, three moods (declarative, imperative and conditional), two voices (active and antipassive) and six tenses: present I (progressive), present II (stative), past I (aorist), past II (perfect), future I (perfective future), future II (imperfective future). Past II is formed with a construction meaning possession (literally \"to be with\"), similar to the use of \"have\" in the perfect in English and other Western European languages.\n\nBoth subject and direct object are cross-referenced in the verbal chain, and person agreement is very different in intransitive and transitive verbs. Person agreement is expressed with a complex system involving both prefixes and suffixes; despite the agglutinative nature of the language, each individual combination of person, number, tense etc. is expressed in a way that is far from always straightforward. Besides the finite forms, there are also infinitive, supine (purposive), numerous gerund forms, and a present and past participle, and these are all used with auxiliary verbs to produce further analytic constructions.\n\nThe \"numeral\" system was originally purely vigesimal and went up to 400, but a decimal system was introduced for numerals above 100 via Russian influence. Many of the names of the basic numbers can be traced etymologically to words referring to the human body (\"finger\", \"hand\" etc.) or to arithmetic operations (6 = \"1 + 5\" etc.).\n\nThe word order is rather free, though SOV is basic. The possessor normally precedes the possessed, and postpositions rather than prepositions are used.\n\nChukchi as a language often proves difficult to categorize. This is primarily due to the fact that it does not always follow a typical linguistic and syntactical pattern. These exceptions allow Chukchi to fit into more than one linguistic type.\n\nThe Chukchi people have a rich history and culture, which have traditionally centered around war. The Chukchi prize warriors and the fighting spirit that they embody. This emphasis on conflict can be seen in the interactions between the Chukchi and the Russians, which date back to the middle of the seventeenth century and tell of glorious battles between the two groups. The Chukchi have also been known to battle nearby tribes, particularly the Tánñit, which comprise fellow Siberian peoples known as the Koryaks. However, over the last century, the Chukchi people have engaged in far fewer conflicts and have focused more on trading. Today, the Chukchi economy relies heavily on trade, particularly with Russia.\n\nBesides trading with Russia, the Chukchi make their living off of herding reindeer and bartering with other tribes. There is also a group of Chukchi that do not herd reindeer and instead live along the coast, trading more with tribes who live along the pacific coast. Some Chukchi people even choose to go back and forth between the two divisions, trading with both. These people tend to control more of the trade and have been called Kavrálît or “Rangers”.\n\nThe external influences of Chukchi have not been well-studied. In particular, the degree of contacts between the Chukchi and Eskimo languages remains an open question. Research into this area is problematic in part because of the lack of written evidence. (Cf. de Reuse in the Bibliography.) Contact influence of Russian, which is increasing, consists of word borrowing and pressure on surface syntax; the latter is primarily seen in written communication (translated texts) and is not apparent in day-to-day speech.\n\n"}
{"id": "600194", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=600194", "title": "Cool World", "text": "Cool World\n\nCool World is a 1992 American live-action/animated thriller-fantasy film directed by Ralph Bakshi, and starring Kim Basinger, Gabriel Byrne and Brad Pitt. It tells the story of a cartoonist who finds himself in the animated world he thinks he created, and is seduced by one of the characters, a comic strip vamp who wants to be real. \n\n\"Cool World\" marked Bakshi's return to feature films after nine years. The film was originally pitched as an animated horror film about an underground cartoonist who fathers an illegitimate half-real/half-cartoon daughter, who hates herself for what she is and tries to kill him. During production, Bakshi's original screenplay was scrapped by producer Frank Mancuso, Jr. and heavily rewritten by Michael Grais and Mark Victor in secret. Reviews praised the film's visuals, but criticized the story and characters, as well as the combination of live-action and animation, which some critics felt was unconvincing. The film would eventually gross only half its production budget.\n\nIn 1945 Las Vegas, World War II veteran Frank Harris returns from Italy with a motorcycle and reunites with his mother, Agatha. Frank and Agatha are struck in a traffic collision with a drunk driver while riding his motorcycle, resulting in Agatha's death; Frank is transported to an animated realm named the \"Cool World\". \n\nForty-seven years later, detained cartoonist Jack Deebs creates a comic book named \"Cool World\", which features the femme fatale Holli Would. Holli voices her desire to enter the real world, but is declined help from Frank, who is now a detective in the Cool World. After being released from prison, Jack is transported to the Cool World and is smuggled into a club by Holli. \n\nFrank becomes aware of Jack's presence in the Cool World and aggressively confronts him, informing him that Cool World has existed long before Jack created the comic series and warns him that \"noids\" (humans from the real world) aren't allowed to have sex with \"doodles\" (the inhabitants of the Cool World). Holli brings Jack back into the Cool World and the two have sex, causing Holli to transform into a human.\n\nWhile Frank attempts to mend his relationship with doodle Lonette, he temporarily leaves detective duties to his assistant Nails. Jack and Holli leave for the real world, causing damage to the interdimensional barrier between the real world and the Cool World. Both Jack and Holli begin flickering from their human form to their doodle forms: Jack's doodle form is a stocky man with a moustache while Holli's new doodle form is a sexy clown. \n\nFrank discovers that Nails has been done away with and decides to venture into the real world to pursue Jack and Holli. While contemplating their situation, Holli tells Jack about the \"Spike of Power,\" an artifact placed on the top of a Las Vegas casino by a doodle who crossed into the real world. When Jack displays skepticism about the idea, Holli abandons Jack to search for the spike on her own.\n\nWhen Frank pursues Holli on the casino. Holli, as a sexy clown doodle, is able to jump through walls. Which she does to enter a locked room. As Frank attempts to kick in the locked door, Holli in her sexy clown doodle form, kicks him in the groin through the door. Enraged, Frank kicks open the door and corners her. Holli tries to use her sexy clown doodle form to escape to the next room but fails. Holli kills him by kicking him off the building. \n\nHolli finds and takes the Spike of Power, transforming her and Jack into doodles and releasing numerous monstrous doodles into the real world. Fighting off an increasing number of doodles as a superhero doodle, Jack returns the Spike of Power to its place, trapping him, Holli and the rest of the doodles in Cool World. Though Frank was killed by Holli, since she killed him in her doodle-form, Frank's reborn into Cool World as a doodle, which allows him to finally be able to consummate his relationship with Lonette.\n\n\n\nIn 1990, Ralph Bakshi decided that it was time to make another animated film. According to Bakshi, \"I made 1,500 bucks in 10 years of painting; I thought it would be nice to pick up a piece of change. So I called my lawyer, who was still speaking to me because no one ever leaves Hollywood, and asked him where I should go to sell a movie.\" Bakshi pitched \"Cool World\" to Paramount Pictures (where Bakshi had worked as the final head of the studio's animation division) as an animated horror film. The concept of the film involved a cartoon and live action human having sex and conceiving a hybrid child who visits the real world to murder the father who abandoned her. Bakshi states that Paramount Pictures \"bought the idea in ten seconds\".\n\nAs the sets were being built in Las Vegas, producer Frank Mancuso, Jr., son of Paramount president Frank Mancuso, Sr., had the screenplay rewritten in secret, and gave Bakshi a new screenplay by screenwriters Michael Grais and Mark Victor that \"was barely the same\". Larry Gross also contributed to the script, but his work would later go on to be uncredited. In interviews at the time of the film's release, Mancuso, Jr., who was best known for the \"Friday the 13th\" franchise, stated a desire to move away from horror films, and wanted to produce a film \"about what happens when someone creates a world, becomes defined by it, and then can't escape [...] a film about being trapped by your own creation.\" Bakshi remembers that he got into a fight with Mancuso, Jr. and \"punched [him] in the mouth.\" Paramount threatened Bakshi with a lawsuit if he refused to complete the film. \"I thought if I did the animation well, it would be worth it, but you know what? It wasn't worth it.\" Bakshi also stated that he \"had a lot of animators there that I'd brought in and I thought that maybe I could just have fun animating this stuff, which I did.\" Bakshi had developed the film as a mix of comedy and horror that he described as \"a hard R-rated story\" but Paramount wanted a PG-13 film, one of the reasons for the doomed and angry relationship between filmmaker and studio.\n\nBakshi had originally intended to cast Drew Barrymore and Brad Pitt in the film's leading roles. Brad Pitt was cast as Frank Harris instead, with Gabriel Byrne as Deebs and Kim Basinger as Holli. The film's voice cast includes Maurice LaMarche, Charlie Adler and Candi Milo. According to Bakshi, Basinger had attempted to rewrite the film halfway into its production because she \"thought it would be great [...] if she would be able to show this picture in hospitals to sick children [...] I said, 'Kim, I think that's wonderful, but you've got the wrong guy to do that with.' [...] [Mancuso] was sitting there with Kim [...] agreeing with her.\"\n\nThe visual design of the live-action footage was intended to look like \"a living, walk-through painting\", a visual concept Bakshi had long wanted to achieve. The film's sets were based upon enlargements of designer Barry Jackson's paintings. The animation was strongly influenced by Fleischer Studios (whose cartoons were released by Paramount) and Terrytoons (where Bakshi once worked, and whose Mighty Mouse character was also adapted into a series by Bakshi). The artwork by the character Jack Deebs was drawn by underground comix artist Spain Rodriguez. The film's animators were never given a screenplay, and were instead told by Bakshi to \"Do a scene that's funny, whatever you want to do!\"\n\nA soundtrack album, \"Songs from the Cool World\", featuring recordings by My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult, Moby, Ministry, The Future Sound of London, and others, was released in 1992 by Warner Bros. Records. It included the track \"Real Cool World\" by David Bowie, his first original solo material in roughly three years; the song was written exclusively for the film. The soundtrack received stronger reviews from critics than the film itself, including a four-star rating from Allmusic. Mark Isham's original score for \"Cool World\", featuring a mixture of jazz, orchestral pieces, and electronic remixes, and performed by the Munich Symphony Orchestra, was released on compact disc by Varèse Sarabande, and in complete form in 2015 by Quartet. It also received positive reviews.\n\nAs part of the film's promotion, the Hollywood Sign was altered to include a 75-foot-tall cutout of Holli Would. The alteration angered local residents. In a letter to the city's Recreation and Park Board, commission officials wrote that they were \"appalled\" by the board's approval of the alterations and that \"the action your board has taken is offensive to Los Angeles women and is not within your role as custodian and guardian of the Hollywood sign. The fact that Paramount Pictures donated a mere $27,000 to Rebuild L.A. should not be a passport to exploit women in Los Angeles.\" Protestors picketed the unveiling of the altered sign. The promotional campaign was focused on the sex appeal of Holli. It was considered by some experts as misaimed, with Paramount's marketing president Barry London saying \"\"Cool World\" unfortunately did not seem to satisfy the younger audience it was aimed at,\" and designer Milton Knight recalling that \"Audiences actually wanted a wilder, raunchier \"Cool World\". The premiere audience I saw it with certainly did.\"\n\nSeveral different licensed video games based on the film were created by Ocean Software. The first game was developed by Twilight and released in 1992 for the Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64 and DOS. Two different games were released in 1993 for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Super NES, alongside a Game Boy version of the former. A four-issue comic book prequel to the film was published as a miniseries by DC Comics. It featured a script by Michael Eury and art work by Stephen DeStefano, Chuck Fiala and Bill Wray. \n\n\"Cool World\" opened at sixth on the North American box office, with $5.5 million. Its lifetime gross was $14.1 million, a little more than half its reported $28 million budget. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes collected a sample of 46 reviews and judged 4% of them to be positive. Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" wrote that \"Cool World\" \"misses one opportunity after another\", describing it as \"a surprisingly incompetent film\". \"Deseret News\" reviewer Chris Hicks described it as \"a one-joke movie – and it's a dirty joke. [...] And much of what's going on here seems more angry and nasty than inspired or funny.\" \"Variety\" reviewer Brian Lowry compared the film to an extended music video, praising the soundtrack and visuals, but panning the story. Leonard Maltin described the film as \"too serious to be fun [and] too goofy to take seriously\", and the lead characters as \"unlikable and unappealing\". \"The Washington Post\" reviewer Hal Hinson wondered \"whether Kim Basinger is more obnoxious as a cartoon or as a real person,\" and felt that the combination of animation and live action was unconvincing. Contributing to the low box office was the fact the studio withdrew all advertising support after the opening weekend. \n\nIn 1997, John Grant wrote in \"The Encyclopedia of Fantasy\" that \"Cool World\" \"stands as one of the fantastic cinema's most significant achievements, an instauration fantasy that reveals greater depths with each viewing.\" Animation historian Jerry Beck described the film as being \"for adults and Bakshi completists only,\" writing that the film \"has a great premise, a great cast, and the best animation he's ever been involved with,\" but critiquing it as a \"pointless rehash of many of Ralph's favorite themes, and the story literally goes nowhere.\" The film garnered a Razzie Award nomination for Worst Actress (Kim Basinger; also for \"Final Analysis\").\n\n"}
{"id": "3287436", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3287436", "title": "Coraline (film)", "text": "Coraline (film)\n\nCoraline is a 2009 American 3D stop-motion dark fantasy horror film based on Neil Gaiman's 2002 novel of the same name. It is the first feature film produced by Laika, and is distributed by Focus Features. The film depicts an adventurous girl finding an idealized parallel world behind a secret door in her new home, unaware that the alternative world contains a dark and sinister secret. Written and directed by Henry Selick, the film was made with Gaiman's approval and co-operation.\n\nThe film was released in United States theaters on February 6, 2009, after a world premiere at the Portland International Film Festival, and received critical acclaim. The film made $16.85 million during opening weekend, ranking third at the box office, and by the end of its run had grossed over $124 million worldwide. \"Coraline\" won Annie Awards for Best Music in an Animated Feature Production, Best Character Design in an Animated Feature Production and Best Production Design in an Animated Feature Production, and received Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for Best Animated Feature.\n\nCoraline Jones and her parents move from Pontiac, Michigan, to their new home in Ashland, Oregon, the dilapidated Pink Palace Apartments. Her eccentric new neighbors include Mr. Bobinsky, Miss Spink and Miss Forcible. Due to her parents constantly working, Coraline frequently explores the area. Whilst exploring, she meets a black cat and Wyborne \"Wybie\" Lovat, the grandson of the landlady, whose twin sister mysteriously disappeared years ago. Wybie gives Coraline a button-eyed ragdoll that resembles her. The doll then lures her to a small door in the living room, which is bricked up and can only be unlocked by a button key. \n\nThat night, a mouse guides her through the door, where the bricks have been replaced by a corridor to the Other World, inhabited by button-eyed doppelgängers of people from her world. Coraline meets the Other Mother and Other Father, who are much more attentive and entertaining than her real parents. After dinner, she goes to sleep in her Other Bedroom, but awakes in her real bedroom. Despite cryptic warnings from her neighbors, Coraline visits the Other World three times, where she meets the Other Mr. Bobinsky, who performs a mice circus, the Other Miss Spink and Miss Forcible, who perform a never-ending burlesque act and the Other Wybie, who is mute. Despite having no Other World counterpart, the black cat is able to speak in the Other World.\n\nThe Other Mother invites Coraline to stay forever, under the condition that a pair of buttons will be sewn over her eyes. Terrified, Coraline attempts to flee, but the Other Mother sees through her plan and blocks all the exits to the real world. The cat reappears and reveals to her the sinister truth about the Other World and the Other Mother. The Other Mother, appearing taller, thinner and more grotesque, then \"disciplines\" Coraline by imprisoning her behind a mirror. There, Coraline meets the ghosts of previous victims, including the missing twin sister of Wybie's grandmother. They reveal that the Other Mother, whom they refer to as the Beldam, created and sent button-eyed rag dolls that resembled them in order to spy on their lives. With the promise of a better life, she lured them into the Other World, where she sewed buttons over their eyes and consumed their lives. To free their souls, their real eyes need to be found. Coraline promises to help.\n\nCoraline is suddenly rescued from the mirror by the Other Wybie, whose mouth has been stitched by the Beldam. He helps her escape back to the real world, but Coraline discovers that her parents are missing. She eventually deduces that they have been kidnapped by the Beldam and returns to the Other World, but not before Spink and Forcible grant her a stone with a hole in it. The cat advises Coraline to propose a \"game\". Coraline proposes a game to the Beldam: if Coraline cannot find her parents and the ghosts' eyes, she will let buttons be sewn over her eyes, but if she can, they will all be set free. The Beldam reluctantly agrees.\n\nUsing the stone, Coraline finds the ghosts' eyes in the Other World, now turned into nightmarish, from its monstrous, freakish, deranged inhabitants. As she does, the Other Pink Palace Apartments' surroundings gradually disintegrate until only the living room is left. Inside, Coraline sees the Beldam in her skeletal-arachnoid form. Warned that the Beldam will never accept Coraline's victory, she tricks her into unlocking the door. While the Beldam is distracted, Coraline finds her parents trapped in a snow globe, grabs it, and throws the cat at the Beldam's face, ripping her button eyes out. The Beldam furiously converts the floor into a spiderweb but Coraline and the cat manage to climb out of it, slam and lock the door shut on the Beldam's hand, severing it. \n\nHer parents reappear in the real world, with no memory of what happened. That night, the ghosts warn her to get rid of the button key to prevent the Beldam from accessing the real world. As Coraline prepares to drop it down the well, the severed hand attacks her and tries to drag her back to the Other World. Wybie smashes it with a rock, then throws the remains and the key into the well and seals it shut to prevent anyone else from entering the Other World. The next day, Coraline and her parents, who have finally finished their work, host a garden party for the neighbors. Coraline also prepares to tell Mrs. Lovat the truth about her twin sister whilst the cat disappears behind the pink palace welcome sign.\n\n\nDirector Henry Selick met author Neil Gaiman just as Gaiman was finishing the novel \"Coraline\", and given that Gaiman was a fan of Selick's \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\", he invited him to make a possible adaptation of the film. As Selick thought a direct adaptation would lead to \"maybe a 47-minute movie\", his screenplay had some expansions, such as the creation of Wybie. When looking for a design away from that of most animation, Selick discovered the work of Japanese illustrator Tadahiro Uesugi and invited him to become the concept artist. One of Uesugi's biggest influences was on the color palette, which was muted in reality and more colorful in the Other World. Uesugi declared that \"at the beginning, it was supposed to be a small project over a few weeks to simply create characters; however, I ended up working on the project for over a year, eventually designing sets and backgrounds, on top of drawing the basic images for the story to be built upon.\"\n\n\"Coraline\" was staged in a 140,000-square-foot (13,000 m) warehouse in Hillsboro, Oregon. The stage was divided into 50 lots, which played host to nearly 150 sets. Among the sets were three miniature Victorian mansions, a 42-foot (12.8 m) apple orchard, and a model of Ashland, Oregon, including tiny details such as banners for the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. More than 28 animators worked at a time on rehearsing or shooting scenes, producing 90–100 seconds of finished animation each week. To add the stereoscopy for the 3D release, the animators shot each frame from two slightly apart camera positions.\n\nEvery object on screen was made for the film. The crew used three 3D printing systems from Objet in the development and production of the film. Thousands of high-quality 3D models, ranging from facial expressions to doorknobs, were printed in 3D using the Polyjet matrix systems, which enable the fast transformation of CAD (computer-aided design) drawings into high-quality 3D models. The puppets had separate parts for the upper and lower parts of the head that could be exchanged for different facial expressions, and the characters of \"Coraline\" could potentially exhibit over 208,000 facial expressions.\nComputer artists composited separatedly-shot elements together, or added elements of their own, which had to look handcrafted instead of computer-generated – for instance, the flames were done with traditional animation and painted digitally, and the fog was dry ice.\n\nAt its peak, the film involved the efforts of 450 people, including from 30 to 35 animators and digital designers in the Digital Design Group (DDG), directed by Dan Casey, and more than 250 technicians and designers. One crew member, Althea Crome, was hired specifically to knit miniature sweaters and other clothing for the puppet characters, sometimes using knitting needles as thin as human hair. The clothes also simulated wear using paint and a file. Several students from The Art Institute of Portland were also involved in making the film.\n\nThe soundtrack for \"Coraline\" features songs by French composer Bruno Coulais, with one, \"Other Father Song\", by They Might Be Giants. The Other Father's singing voice is provided by John Linnell, one of the singers from the band. They had initially written 10 songs for the film; when a melancholy tone was decided, all but one were cut. Coulais' score was performed by the Hungarian Symphony Orchestra and features choral pieces sung by the Children's Choir of Nice in a nonsense language. Selick mentions that the main soloist, \"a young girl you hear singing in several parts of the film,\" is coincidentally named Coraline. \"Coraline\" won Coulais the 2009 Annie Award for best score for an animated feature.\n\n\n\"Coraline\" was theatrically released on February 6, 2009.\n\nThe film was released on DVD and Blu-ray in the United States on July 21, 2009, by Universal Studios Home Entertainment. A 3-D version comes with four sets of 3-D glasses—specifically the green-magenta anaglyph image. \"Coraline\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray in the United Kingdom on October 12, 2009. A 3-D version of the film was also released on a 2-Disc Collector's Edition. The DVD opened to first week sales of 1,036,845 and over $19 million in revenue. Total sales stand at over 2.6 million units and over $45 million in revenue. A two-disc Blu-ray 3D set, which includes a stereoscopic 3D on the first disc and an anaglyph 3D image, was released in 2011.\n\nThe website for \"Coraline\" involves an interactive exploration game where the player can scroll through Coraline's world. It won the 2009 Webby Award for \"Best Use of Animation or Motion Graphics\", both by the people and the Webby organization. It was also nominated for the Webby \"Movie and Film\" category. On June 16, 2008, D3 Publisher announced the release of a video game based on the film. It was developed by Papaya Studio for the Wii and PlayStation 2 and by Art Co. for Nintendo DS. It was released on January 27, 2009, close to the film's theatrical release. The soundtrack was released digitally February 3, 2009, by E1 Music, and in stores on February 24, 2009.\n\nAccording to Paul Dergarabedian, a film business analyst with Media by Numbers, for the film to succeed it needed a box office comparable to \"\", which had grossed $16 million its opening weekend and ended up making more than $192 million worldwide; prior to the film's release, Dergarabedian thought Laika Studios \"should be really pleased\" were \"Coraline\" to make $10 million in its opening weekend. In its US opening weekend, the film grossed $16.85 million, ranking third at the box office. It made $15 million during its second weekend, bringing its U.S. total up to $35.6 million, $25.5 million of which came from 3D presentations. As of November 2009, the film has grossed $75,286,229 in the United States and Canada and $49,310,169 in other territories, for a total of $124,596,398 worldwide.\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 90% based on 262 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"With its vivid stop-motion animation combined with Neil Gaiman's imaginative story, \"Coraline\" is a film that's both visually stunning and wondrously entertaining.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 80 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nDavid Edelstein said the film is \"a \"bona fide\" fairy tale\" that needed a \"touch less entrancement and a touch more ... story.\" A. O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" called the film \"exquisitely realized,\" with a \"slower pace and a more contemplative tone than the novel. It is certainly exciting, but rather than race through ever noisier set pieces toward a hectic climax in the manner of so much animation aimed at kids, \"Coraline\" lingers in an atmosphere that is creepy, wonderfully strange and full of feeling.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "142910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=142910", "title": "Creativity", "text": "Creativity\n\nCreativity is a phenomenon whereby something new and somehow valuable is formed. The created item may be intangible (such as an idea, a scientific theory, a musical composition, or a joke) or a physical object (such as an invention, a literary work, or a painting).\n\nScholarly interest in creativity is found in a number of disciplines, primarily psychology, business studies, and cognitive science, but also education, technology, engineering, philosophy (particularly philosophy of science), theology, sociology, linguistics, and economics, covering the relations between creativity and general intelligence, personality type, mental and neurological processes, mental health, or artificial intelligence; the potential for fostering creativity through education and training; the fostering of creativity for national economic benefit, and the application of creative resources to improve the effectiveness of teaching and learning.\n\nThe lexeme in the English word \"creativity\" comes from the Latin term \"creō\" \"to create, make\": its derivational suffixes also come from Latin. The word \"create\" appeared in English as early as the 14th century, notably in Chaucer, to indicate divine creation (in The Parson's Tale). However, its modern meaning as an act of human creation did not emerge until after the Enlightenment.\n\nIn a summary of scientific research into creativity, Michael Mumford suggested: \"Over the course of the last decade, however, we seem to have reached a general agreement that creativity involves the production of novel, useful products\" (Mumford, 2003, p. 110), or, in Robert Sternberg's words, the production of \"something original and worthwhile\". Authors have diverged dramatically in their precise definitions beyond these general commonalities: Peter Meusburger reckons that over a hundred different analyses can be found in the literature. As an illustration, one definition given by Dr. E. Paul Torrance described it as \"a process of becoming sensitive to problems, deficiencies, gaps in knowledge, missing elements, disharmonies, and so on; identifying the difficulty; searching for solutions, making guesses, or formulating hypotheses about the deficiencies: testing and retesting these hypotheses and possibly modifying and retesting them; and finally communicating the results.\"\n\nTheories of creativity (particularly investigation of why some people are more creative than others) have focused on a variety of aspects. The dominant factors are usually identified as \"the four Ps\" — process, product, person, and place (according to Mel Rhodes). A focus on \"process\" is shown in cognitive approaches that try to describe thought mechanisms and techniques for creative thinking. Theories invoking divergent rather than convergent thinking (such as Guilford), or those describing the staging of the creative process (such as Wallas) are primarily theories of creative process. A focus on creative \"product\" usually appears in attempts to measure creativity (psychometrics, see below) and in creative ideas framed as successful memes. The psychometric approach to creativity reveals that it also involves the ability to produce more.\nA focus on the nature of the creative \"person\" considers more general intellectual habits, such as openness, levels of ideation, autonomy, expertise, exploratory behavior, and so on. A focus on \"place\" considers the circumstances in which creativity flourishes, such as degrees of autonomy, access to resources, and the nature of gatekeepers. Creative lifestyles are characterized by nonconforming attitudes and behaviors as well as flexibility.\n\nMost ancient cultures, including thinkers of Ancient Greece, Ancient China, and Ancient India, lacked the concept of creativity, seeing art as a form of discovery and not creation. The ancient Greeks had no terms corresponding to \"to create\" or \"creator\" except for the expression \"poiein\" (\"to make\"), which only applied to \"poiesis\" (poetry) and to the \"poietes\" (poet, or \"maker\") who made it. Plato did not believe in art as a form of creation. Asked in \"The Republic\", \"Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something?\", he answers, \"Certainly not, he merely imitates.\"\n\nIt is commonly argued that the notion of \"creativity\" originated in Western culture through Christianity, as a matter of divine inspiration. According to the historian Daniel J. Boorstin, \"the early Western conception of creativity was the Biblical story of creation given in the \"Genesis\".\" However, this is not creativity in the modern sense, which did not arise until the Renaissance. In the Judaeo-Christian tradition, creativity was the sole province of God; humans were not considered to have the ability to create something new except as an expression of God's work. A concept similar to that of Christianity existed in Greek culture, for instance, Muses were seen as mediating inspiration from the Gods. Romans and Greeks invoked the concept of an external creative \"daemon\" (Greek) or \"genius\" (Latin), linked to the sacred or the divine. However, none of these views are similar to the modern concept of creativity, and the individual was not seen as the cause of creation until the Renaissance. It was during the Renaissance that creativity was first seen, not as a conduit for the divine, but from the abilities of \"great men\".\n\nThe rejection of creativity in favor of discovery and the belief that individual creation was a conduit of the divine would dominate the West probably until the Renaissance and even later. The development of the modern concept of creativity begins in the Renaissance, when creation began to be perceived as having originated from the abilities of the individual, and not God. This could be attributed to the leading intellectual movement of the time, aptly named humanism, which developed an intensely human-centric outlook on the world, valuing the intellect and achievement of the individual. From this philosophy arose the Renaissance man (or polymath), an individual who embodies the principals of humanism in their ceaseless courtship with knowledge and creation. One of the most well-known and immensely accomplished examples is Leonardo da Vinci.\n\nHowever, this shift was gradual and would not become immediately apparent until the Enlightenment. By the 18th century and the Age of Enlightenment, mention of creativity (notably in aesthetics), linked with the concept of imagination, became more frequent. In the writing of Thomas Hobbes, imagination became a key element of human cognition; William Duff was one of the first to identify imagination as a quality of genius, typifying the separation being made between talent (productive, but breaking no new ground) and genius.\n\nAs a direct and independent topic of study, creativity effectively received no attention until the 19th century. Runco and Albert argue that creativity as the subject of proper study began seriously to emerge in the late 19th century with the increased interest in individual differences inspired by the arrival of Darwinism. In particular, they refer to the work of Francis Galton, who through his eugenicist outlook took a keen interest in the heritability of intelligence, with creativity taken as an aspect of genius.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, leading mathematicians and scientists such as Hermann von Helmholtz (1896) and Henri Poincaré (1908) began to reflect on and publicly discuss their creative processes.\n\nThe insights of Poincaré and von Helmholtz were built on in early accounts of the creative process by pioneering theorists such as Graham Wallas and Max Wertheimer. In his work \"Art of Thought\", published in 1926, Wallas presented one of the first models of the creative process. In the Wallas stage model, creative insights and illuminations may be explained by a process consisting of 5 stages:\nWallas' model is often treated as four stages, with \"intimation\" seen as a sub-stage.\n\nWallas considered creativity to be a legacy of the evolutionary process, which allowed humans to quickly adapt to rapidly changing environments. Simonton provides an updated perspective on this view in his book, \"Origins of genius: Darwinian perspectives on creativity\".\n\nIn 1927, Alfred North Whitehead gave the Gifford Lectures at the University of Edinburgh, later published as \"Process and Reality.\" He is credited with having coined the term \"creativity\" to serve as the ultimate category of his metaphysical scheme: \"Whitehead actually coined the term – our term, still the preferred currency of exchange among literature, science, and the arts. . . a term that quickly became so popular, so omnipresent, that its invention within living memory, and by Alfred North Whitehead of all people, quickly became occluded\".\n\nThe formal psychometric measurement of creativity, from the standpoint of orthodox psychological literature, is usually considered to have begun with J. P. Guilford's 1950 address to the American Psychological Association, which helped popularize the topic and focus attention on a scientific approach to conceptualizing creativity. (It should be noted that the London School of Psychology had instigated psychometric studies of creativity as early as 1927 with the work of H. L. Hargreaves into the Faculty of Imagination, but it did not have the same impact.) Statistical analysis led to the recognition of creativity (as measured) as a separate aspect of human cognition to IQ-type intelligence, into which it had previously been subsumed. Guilford's work suggested that above a threshold level of IQ, the relationship between creativity and classically measured intelligence broke down.\n\nJames C. Kaufman and Beghetto introduced a \"four C\" model of creativity; \"mini-c\" (\"transformative learning\" involving \"personally meaningful interpretations of experiences, actions, and insights\"), \"little-c\" (everyday problem solving and creative expression), \"Pro-C\" (exhibited by people who are professionally or vocationally creative though not necessarily eminent) and \"Big-C\" (creativity considered great in the given field). This model was intended to help accommodate models and theories of creativity that stressed competence as an essential component and the historical transformation of a creative domain as the highest mark of creativity. It also, the authors argued, made a useful framework for analyzing creative processes in individuals.\n\nThe contrast of terms \"Big C\" and \"Little c\" has been widely used. Kozbelt, Beghetto and Runco use a little-c/Big-C model to review major theories of creativity. Margaret Boden distinguishes between h-creativity (historical) and p-creativity (personal).\n\nRobinson and Anna Craft have focused on creativity in a general population, particularly with respect to education. Craft makes a similar distinction between \"high\" and \"little c\" creativity. and cites Ken Robinson as referring to \"high\" and \"democratic\" creativity. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi has defined creativity in terms of those individuals judged to have made significant creative, perhaps domain-changing contributions. Simonton has analysed the career trajectories of eminent creative people in order to map patterns and predictors of creative productivity.\n\nThere has been much empirical study in psychology and cognitive science of the processes through which creativity occurs. Interpretation of the results of these studies has led to several possible explanations of the sources and methods of creativity.\n\nIncubation is a temporary break from creative problem solving that can result in insight. There has been some empirical research looking at whether, as the concept of \"incubation\" in Wallas' model implies, a period of interruption or rest from a problem may aid creative problem-solving. Ward lists various hypotheses that have been advanced to explain why incubation may aid creative problem-solving, and notes how some empirical evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that incubation aids creative problem-solving in that it enables \"forgetting\" of misleading clues. Absence of incubation may lead the problem solver to become fixated on inappropriate strategies of solving the problem. This work disputes the earlier hypothesis that creative solutions to problems arise mysteriously from the unconscious mind while the conscious mind is occupied on other tasks. \nThis earlier hypothesis is discussed in Csikszentmihalyi's five phase model of the creative process which describes incubation as a time that your unconscious takes over. This allows for unique connections to be made without your consciousness trying to make logical order out of the problem.\n\nJ. P. Guilford drew a distinction between convergent and divergent production (commonly renamed convergent and divergent thinking). Convergent thinking involves aiming for a single, correct solution to a problem, whereas divergent thinking involves creative generation of multiple answers to a set problem. Divergent thinking is sometimes used as a synonym for creativity in psychology literature. Other researchers have occasionally used the terms \"flexible\" thinking or fluid intelligence, which are roughly similar to (but not synonymous with) creativity.\n\nIn 1992, Finke et al. proposed the \"Geneplore\" model, in which creativity takes place in two phases: a generative phase, where an individual constructs mental representations called preinventive structures, and an exploratory phase where those structures are used to come up with creative ideas. Some evidence shows that when people use their imagination to develop new ideas, those ideas are heavily structured in predictable ways by the properties of existing categories and concepts. Weisberg argued, by contrast, that creativity only involves ordinary cognitive processes yielding extraordinary results.\n\nHelie and Sun recently proposed a unified framework for understanding creativity in problem solving, namely the Explicit–Implicit Interaction (EII) theory of creativity. This new theory constitutes an attempt at providing a more unified explanation of relevant phenomena (in part by reinterpreting/integrating various fragmentary existing theories of incubation and insight).\n\nThe EII theory relies mainly on five basic principles, namely:\nA computational implementation of the theory was developed based on the CLARION cognitive architecture and used to simulate relevant human data. This work represents an initial step in the development of process-based theories of creativity encompassing incubation, insight, and various other related phenomena.\n\nIn \"The Act of Creation\", Arthur Koestler introduced the concept of \"bisociation\" — that creativity arises as a result of the intersection of two quite different frames of reference. This idea was later developed into conceptual blending. In the 1990s, various approaches in cognitive science that dealt with metaphor, analogy, and structure mapping have been converging, and a new integrative approach to the study of creativity in science, art and humor has emerged under the label conceptual blending.\n\nHoning theory, developed principally by psychologist Liane Gabora, posits that creativity arises due to the self-organizing, self-mending nature of a worldview. The creative process is a way in which the individual hones (and re-hones) an integrated worldview. Honing theory places emphasis not only on the externally visible creative outcome but also the internal cognitive restructuring and repair of the worldview brought about by the creative process. When faced with a creatively demanding task, there is an interaction between the conception of the task and the worldview. The conception of the task changes through interaction with the worldview, and the worldview changes through interaction with the task. This interaction is reiterated until the task is complete, at which point not only is the task conceived of differently, but the worldview is subtly or drastically transformed as it follows the natural tendency of a worldview to attempt to resolve dissonance and seek internal consistency amongst its components, whether they be ideas, attitudes, or bits of knowledge.\n\nA central feature of honing theory is the notion of a potentiality state. Honing theory posits that creative thought proceeds not by searching through and randomly ‘mutating’ predefined possibilities, but by drawing upon associations that exist due to overlap in the distributed neural cell assemblies that participate in the encoding of experiences in memory. Midway through the creative process one may have made associations between the current task and previous experiences, but not yet disambiguated which aspects of those previous experiences are relevant to the current task. Thus the creative idea may feel ‘half-baked’. It is at that point that it can be said to be in a potentiality state, because how it will actualize depends on the different internally or externally generated contexts it interacts with.\n\nHoning theory is held to explain certain phenomena not dealt with by other theories of creativity, for example, how different works by the same creator are observed in studies to exhibit a recognizable style or 'voice' even through in different creative outlets. This is not predicted by theories of creativity that emphasize chance processes or the accumulation of expertise, but it is predicted by honing theory, according to which personal style reflects the creator's uniquely structured worldview. Another example is in the environmental stimulus for creativity. Creativity is commonly considered to be fostered by a supportive, nurturing, trustworthy environment conducive to self-actualization. However, research shows that creativity is also associated with childhood adversity, which would stimulate honing.\n\nIn everyday thought, people often spontaneously imagine alternatives to reality when they think \"if only...\". Their counterfactual thinking is viewed as an example of everyday creative processes. It has been proposed that the creation of counterfactual alternatives to reality depends on similar cognitive processes to rational thought.\n\nThere was a \"creativity quotient\" developed similar to the intelligence quotient (IQ). It makes use of the results of divergent thinking tests (see below) by processing them further. It gives more weight to ideas that are radically different from other ideas in the response.\n\nJ. P. Guilford's group, which pioneered the modern psychometric study of creativity, constructed several tests to measure creativity in 1967:\n\nBuilding on Guilford's work, Torrance developed the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking in 1966. They involved simple tests of divergent thinking and other problem-solving skills, which were scored on:\n\nSuch tests, sometimes called \"Divergent Thinking (DT)\" tests have been both supported and criticized.<ref name=\"doi10.1080/10400419.2011.545713\"></ref>\n\nConsiderable progress has been made in automated scoring of divergent thinking tests using semantic approach. When compared to human raters, NLP techniques were shown to be reliable and valid in scoring the originality. The reported computer programs were able to achieve a correlation of 0.60 and 0.72 respectively to human graders.\n\nSemantic networks were also used to devise originality scores that yielded significant correlations with socio-personal measures. Most recently, an NSF-funded team of researchers led by James C. Kaufman and Mark A. Runco combined expertise in creativity research, natural language processing, computational linguistics, and statistical data analysis to devise a scalable system for computerized automated testing (SparcIt Creativity Index Testing system). This system enabled automated scoring of DT tests that is reliable, objective, and scalable, thus addressing most of the issues of DT tests that had been found and reported. The resultant computer system was able to achieve a correlation of 0.73 to human graders.\n\nSome researchers have taken a social-personality approach to the measurement of creativity. In these studies, personality traits such as independence of judgement, self-confidence, attraction to complexity, aesthetic orientation, and risk-taking are used as measures of the creativity of individuals. A meta-analysis by Gregory Feist showed that creative people tend to be \"more open to new experiences, less conventional and less conscientious, more self-confident, self-accepting, driven, ambitious, dominant, hostile, and impulsive.\" Openness, conscientiousness, self-acceptance, hostility, and impulsivity had the strongest effects of the traits listed. Within the framework of the Big Five model of personality, some consistent traits have emerged. Openness to experience has been shown to be consistently related to a whole host of different assessments of creativity. Among the other Big Five traits, research has demonstrated subtle differences between different domains of creativity. Compared to non-artists, artists tend to have higher levels of openness to experience and lower levels of conscientiousness, while scientists are more open to experience, conscientious, and higher in the confidence-dominance facets of extraversion compared to non-scientists.\n\nAn alternative are biographical methods. These methods use quantitative characteristics such as the number of publications, patents, or performances of a work. While this method was originally developed for highly creative personalities, today it is also available as self-report questionnaires supplemented with frequent, less outstanding creative behaviors such as writing a short story or creating your own recipes. For example, the Creative Achievement Questionnaire, a self-report test that measures creative achievement across 10 domains, was described in 2005 and shown to be reliable and valid when compared to other measures of creativity and to independent evaluation of creative output. Besides the English original, it was also used in a Chinese, French, and German-speaking version. It is the self-report questionnaire most frequently used in research.\n\nThe potential relationship between creativity and intelligence has been of interest since the late 1900s, when a multitude of influential studies – from Getzels & Jackson, Barron, Wallach & Kogan, and Guilford – focused not only on creativity, but also on intelligence. This joint focus highlights both the theoretical and practical importance of the relationship: researchers are interested not only if the constructs are related, but also how and why.\n\nThere are multiple theories accounting for their relationship, with the 3 main theories as follows:\n\n\nSternberg and O’Hara proposed a framework of 5 possible relationships between creativity and intelligence:\n\nA number of researchers include creativity, either explicitly or implicitly, as a key component of intelligence.\n\n\"Examples of theories that include creativity as a subset of intelligence\"\n\n\nIn this relationship model, intelligence is a key component in the development of creativity.\n\n\"Theories of creativity that include intelligence as a subset of creativity\"\n\n\nThis possible relationship concerns creativity and intelligence as distinct, but intersecting constructs.\n\n\"Theories that include Creativity and Intelligence as Overlapping Yet Distinct Constructs\"\n\n\nIn support of the TT, Barron reported finding a non-significant correlation between creativity and intelligence in a gifted sample; and a significant correlation in a non-gifted sample. Yamamoto in a sample of secondary school children, reported a significant correlation between creativity and intelligence of \"r\" = .3, and reported no significant correlation when the sample consisted of gifted children. Fuchs-Beauchamp et al. in a sample of preschoolers found that creativity and intelligence correlated from \"r\" = .19 to \"r\" = .49 in the group of children who had an IQ below the threshold; and in the group above the threshold, the correlations were \"r\" = <.12. Cho et al. reported a correlation of .40 between creativity and intelligence in the average IQ group of a sample of adolescents and adults; and a correlation of close to \"r\" = .0 for the high IQ group. Jauk et al. found support for the TT, but only for measures of creative potential; not creative performance.\n\nMuch modern day research reports findings against TT. Wai et al. in a study using data from the longitudinal Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth – a cohort of elite students from early adolescence into adulthood – found that differences in SAT scores at age 13 were predictive of creative real-life outcomes 20 years later. Kim’s meta-analysis of 21 studies did not find any supporting evidence for TT, and instead negligible correlations were reported between intelligence, creativity, and divergent thinking both below and above IQ's of 120. Preckel et al., investigating fluid intelligence and creativity, reported small correlations of \"r\" = .3 to \"r\" = .4 across all levels of cognitive ability.\n\nUnder this view, researchers posit that there are no differences in the mechanisms underlying creativity in those used in normal problem solving; and in normal problem solving, there is no need for creativity. Thus, creativity and Intelligence (problem solving) are the same thing. Perkins referred to this as the ‘nothing-special’ view.\n\nWeisberg & Alba examined problem solving by having participants complete the 9-dot problem (see Thinking outside the box#Nine dots puzzle) – where the participants are asked to connect all 9 dots in the 3 rows of 3 dots using 4 straight lines or less, without lifting their pen or tracing the same line twice. The problem can only be solved if the lines go outside the boundaries of the square of dots. Results demonstrated that even when participants were given this insight, they still found it difficult to solve the problem, thus showing that to successfully complete the task it is not just insight (or creativity) that is required.\n\nIn this view, creativity and intelligence are completely different, unrelated constructs.\n\nGetzels and Jackson administered 5 creativity measures to a group of 449 children from grades 6-12, and compared these test findings to results from previously administered (by the school) IQ tests. They found that the correlation between the creativity measures and IQ was \"r\" = .26. The high creativity group scored in the top 20% of the overall creativity measures, but were not included in the top 20% of IQ scorers. The high intelligence group scored the opposite: they scored in the top 20% for IQ, but were outside the top 20% scorers for creativity, thus showing that creativity and intelligence are distinct and unrelated.\n\nHowever, this work has been heavily criticised. Wallach and Kogan highlighted that the creativity measures were not only weakly related to one another (to the extent that they were no more related to one another than they were with IQ), but they seemed to also draw upon non-creative skills. McNemar noted that there were major measurement issues, in that the IQ scores were a mixture from 3 different IQ tests.\n\nWallach and Kogan administered 5 measures of creativity, each of which resulted in a score for originality and fluency; and 10 measures of general intelligence to 151 5th grade children. These tests were untimed, and given in a game-like manner (aiming to facilitate creativity). Inter-correlations between creativity tests were on average \"r\" = .41. Inter-correlations between intelligence measures were on average \"r\" = .51 with each other. Creativity tests and intelligence measures correlated \"r\" = .09.\n\nThe neuroscience of creativity looks at the operation of the brain during creative behaviour. It has been addressed in the article \"Creative Innovation: Possible Brain Mechanisms.\" The authors write that \"creative innovation might require coactivation and communication between regions of the brain that ordinarily are not strongly connected.\" Highly creative people who excel at creative innovation tend to differ from others in three ways:\n\nThus, the frontal lobe appears to be the part of the cortex that is most important for creativity.\n\nThis article also explored the links between creativity and sleep, mood and addiction disorders, and depression.\n\nIn 2005, Alice Flaherty presented a three-factor model of the creative drive. Drawing from evidence in brain imaging, drug studies and lesion analysis, she described the creative drive as resulting from an interaction of the frontal lobes, the temporal lobes, and dopamine from the limbic system. The frontal lobes can be seen as responsible for idea generation, and the temporal lobes for idea editing and evaluation. Abnormalities in the frontal lobe (such as depression or anxiety) generally decrease creativity, while abnormalities in the temporal lobe often increase creativity. High activity in the temporal lobe typically inhibits activity in the frontal lobe, and vice versa. High dopamine levels increase general arousal and goal directed behaviors and reduce latent inhibition, and all three effects increase the drive to generate ideas. A 2015 study on creativity found that it involves the interaction of multiple neural networks, including those that support associative thinking, along with other default mode network functions.\n\nVandervert described how the brain's frontal lobes and the cognitive functions of the cerebellum collaborate to produce creativity and innovation. Vandervert's explanation rests on considerable evidence that all processes of working memory (responsible for processing all thought) are adaptively modeled for increased efficiency by the cerebellum. The cerebellum (consisting of 100 billion neurons, which is more than the entirety of the rest of the brain) is also widely known to adaptively model all bodily movement for efficiency. The cerebellum's adaptive models of working memory processing are then fed back to especially frontal lobe working memory control processes where creative and innovative thoughts arise. (Apparently, creative insight or the \"aha\" experience is then triggered in the temporal lobe.)\n\nAccording to Vandervert, the details of creative adaptation begin in \"forward\" cerebellar models which are anticipatory/exploratory controls for movement and thought. These cerebellar processing and control architectures have been termed Hierarchical Modular Selection and Identification for Control (HMOSAIC). New, hierarchically arranged levels of the cerebellar control architecture (HMOSAIC) develop as mental mulling in working memory is extended over time. These new levels of the control architecture are fed forward to the frontal lobes. Since the cerebellum adaptively models all movement and all levels of thought and emotion, Vandervert's approach helps explain creativity and innovation in sports, art, music, the design of video games, technology, mathematics, the child prodigy, and thought in general.\n\nEssentially, Vandervert has argued that when a person is confronted with a challenging new situation, visual-spatial working memory and speech-related working memory are decomposed and re-composed (fractionated) by the cerebellum and then blended in the cerebral cortex in an attempt to deal with the new situation. With repeated attempts to deal with challenging situations, the cerebro-cerebellar blending process continues to optimize the efficiency of how working memory deals with the situation or problem. Most recently, he has argued that this is the same process (only involving visual-spatial working memory and pre-language vocalization) that led to the evolution of language in humans. Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers have pointed out that this blending process, because it continuously optimizes efficiencies, constantly improves prototyping attempts toward the invention or innovation of new ideas, music, art, or technology. Prototyping, they argue, not only produces new products, it trains the cerebro-cerebellar pathways involved to become more efficient at prototyping itself. Further, Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers believe that this repetitive \"mental prototyping\" or mental rehearsal involving the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex explains the success of the self-driven, individualized patterning of repetitions initiated by the teaching methods of the Khan Academy. The model proposed by Vandervert has, however, received incisive critique from several authors.\n\nCreativity involves the forming of associative elements into new combinations that are useful or meet some requirement. Sleep aids this process. REM rather than NREM sleep appears to be responsible. This has been suggested to be due to changes in cholinergic and noradrenergic neuromodulation that occurs during REM sleep. During this period of sleep, high levels of acetylcholine in the hippocampus suppress feedback from the hippocampus to the neocortex, and lower levels of acetylcholine and norepinephrine in the neocortex encourage the spread of associational activity within neocortical areas without control from the hippocampus. This is in contrast to waking consciousness, where higher levels of norepinephrine and acetylcholine inhibit recurrent connections in the neocortex. It is proposed that REM sleep adds creativity by allowing \"neocortical structures to reorganize associative hierarchies, in which information from the hippocampus would be reinterpreted in relation to previous semantic representations or nodes.\"\n\nSome theories suggest that creativity may be particularly susceptible to affective influence. As noted in voting behavior, the term \"affect\" in this context can refer to liking or disliking key aspects of the subject in question. This work largely follows from findings in psychology regarding the ways in which affective states are involved in human judgment and decision-making.\n\nAccording to Alice Isen, positive affect has three primary effects on cognitive activity:\n\nBarbara Fredrickson in her broaden-and-build model suggests that positive emotions such as joy and love broaden a person's available repertoire of cognitions and actions, thus enhancing creativity.\n\nAccording to these researchers, positive emotions increase the number of cognitive elements available for association (attention scope) and the number of elements that are relevant to the problem (cognitive scope).\n\nVarious meta-analyses, such as Baas et al. (2008) of 66 studies about creativity and affect support the link between creativity and positive affect.\n\nJürgen Schmidhuber's formal theory of creativity postulates that creativity, curiosity, and interestingness are by-products of a simple computational principle for measuring and optimizing learning progress. Consider an agent able to manipulate its environment and thus its own sensory inputs. The agent can use a black box optimization method such as reinforcement learning to learn (through informed trial and error) sequences of actions that maximize the expected sum of its future reward signals. There are extrinsic reward signals for achieving externally given goals, such as finding food when hungry. But Schmidhuber's objective function to be maximized also includes an additional, intrinsic term to model \"wow-effects.\" This non-standard term motivates purely creative behavior of the agent even when there are no external goals. A wow-effect is formally defined as follows. As the agent is creating and predicting and encoding the continually growing history of actions and sensory inputs, it keeps improving the predictor or encoder, which can be implemented as an artificial neural network or some other machine learning device that can exploit regularities in the data to improve its performance over time. The improvements can be measured precisely, by computing the difference in computational costs (storage size, number of required synapses, errors, time) needed to encode new observations before and after learning. This difference depends on the encoder's present subjective knowledge, which changes over time, but the theory formally takes this into account. The cost difference measures the strength of the present \"wow-effect\" due to sudden improvements in data compression or computational speed. It becomes an intrinsic reward signal for the action selector. The objective function thus motivates the action optimizer to create action sequences causing more wow-effects. Irregular, random data (or noise) do not permit any wow-effects or learning progress, and thus are \"boring\" by nature (providing no reward). Already known and predictable regularities also are boring. Temporarily interesting are only the initially unknown, novel, regular patterns in both actions and observations. This motivates the agent to perform continual, open-ended, active, creative exploration.\n\nAccording to Schmidhuber, his objective function explains the activities of scientists, artists, and comedians.\nFor example, physicists are motivated to create experiments leading to observations obeying previously unpublished physical laws permitting better data compression. Likewise, composers receive intrinsic reward for creating non-arbitrary melodies with unexpected but regular harmonies that permit wow-effects through data compression improvements.\nSimilarly, a comedian gets intrinsic reward for \"inventing a novel joke with an unexpected punch line, related to the beginning of the story in an initially unexpected but quickly learnable way that also allows for better compression of the perceived data.\"\nSchmidhuber argues that ongoing computer hardware advances will greatly scale up rudimentary artificial scientists and artists based on simple implementations of the basic principle since 1990.\nHe used the theory to create low-complexity art and an attractive human face.\n\nA study by psychologist J. Philippe Rushton found creativity to correlate with intelligence and psychoticism. Another study found creativity to be greater in schizotypal than in either normal or schizophrenic individuals. While divergent thinking was associated with bilateral activation of the prefrontal cortex, schizotypal individuals were found to have much greater activation of their \"right\" prefrontal cortex. This study hypothesizes that such individuals are better at accessing both hemispheres, allowing them to make novel associations at a faster rate. In agreement with this hypothesis, ambidexterity is also associated with schizotypal and schizophrenic individuals. Three recent studies by Mark Batey and Adrian Furnham have demonstrated the relationships between schizotypal and hypomanic personality and several different measures of creativity.\n\nParticularly strong links have been identified between creativity and mood disorders, particularly manic-depressive disorder (a.k.a. bipolar disorder) and depressive disorder (a.k.a. unipolar disorder). In \"Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament\", Kay Redfield Jamison summarizes studies of mood-disorder rates in writers, poets, and artists. She also explores research that identifies mood disorders in such famous writers and artists as Ernest Hemingway (who shot himself after electroconvulsive treatment), Virginia Woolf (who drowned herself when she felt a depressive episode coming on), composer Robert Schumann (who died in a mental institution), and even the famed visual artist Michelangelo. A different case study suggested for Schumann a difference between bipolar disorder and \"creative bipolarity\".\n\nA study looking at 300,000 persons with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or unipolar depression, and their relatives, found overrepresentation in creative professions for those with bipolar disorder as well as for undiagnosed siblings of those with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. There was no overall overrepresentation, but overrepresentation for artistic occupations, among those diagnosed with schizophrenia. There was no association for those with unipolar depression or their relatives. Another case study suggested a difference between severe mood disorders and \"creative melancholy\", pointing out mild and moderate depression may inspire creative achievements while severe depression inhibits and may even destroy creative activity.\n\nAnother study involving more than one million people, conducted by Swedish researchers at the Karolinska Institute, reported a number of correlations between creative occupations and mental illnesses. Writers had a higher risk of anxiety and bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, unipolar depression, and substance abuse, and were almost twice as likely as the general population to kill themselves. Dancers and photographers were also more likely to have bipolar disorder.\n\nHowever, as a group, those in the creative professions were no more likely to suffer from psychiatric disorders than other people, although they were more likely to have a close relative with a disorder, including anorexia and, to some extent, autism, the Journal of Psychiatric Research reports.\n\nAccording to psychologist Robert Epstein, PhD, creativity can be obstructed through stress.\n\nCreativity can be expressed in a number of different forms, depending on unique people and environments. A number of different theorists have suggested models of the creative person. One model suggests that there are kinds to produce growth, innovation, speed, etc. These are referred to as the four \"Creativity Profiles\" that can help achieve such goals.\n\nResearch by Dr Mark Batey of the Psychometrics at Work Research Group at Manchester Business School has suggested that the creative profile can be explained by four primary creativity traits with narrow facets within each\n\nThis model was developed in a sample of 1000 working adults using the statistical techniques of Exploratory Factor Analysis followed by Confirmatory Factor Analysis by Structural Equation Modelling.\n\nAn important aspect of the creativity profiling approach is to account for the tension between predicting the creative profile of an individual, as characterised by the psychometric approach, and the evidence that team creativity is founded on diversity and difference.\n\nOne characteristic of creative people, as measured by some psychologists, is what is called \"divergent production\". \"Divergent production\" is the ability of a person to generate a diverse assortment, yet an appropriate amount of responses to a given situation. One way of measuring \"divergent production\" is by administering the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking. The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking assesses the diversity, quantity, and appropriateness of participants responses to a variety of open-ended questions.\n\nOther researchers of creativity see the difference in creative people as a cognitive process of dedication to problem solving and developing expertise in the field of their creative expression. Hard working people study the work of people before them and within their current area, become experts in their fields, and then have the ability to add to and build upon previous information in innovative and creative ways. In a study of projects by design students, students who had more knowledge on their subject on average had greater creativity within their projects.\n\nThe aspect of motivation within a person's personality may predict creativity levels in the person. Motivation stems from two different sources, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is an internal drive within a person to participate or invest as a result of personal interest, desires, hopes, goals, etc. Extrinsic motivation is a drive from outside of a person and might take the form of payment, rewards, fame, approval from others, etc. Although extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation can both increase creativity in certain cases, strictly extrinsic motivation often impedes creativity in people.\n\nFrom a personality-traits perspective, there are a number of traits that are associated with creativity in people. Creative people tend to be more open to new experiences, are more self-confident, are more ambitious, self-accepting, impulsive, driven, dominant, and hostile, compared to people with less creativity.\n\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, creativity may be a result of the outcome of years of generating ideas. As ideas are continuously generated, the need to evolve produces a need for new ideas and developments. As a result, people have been creating and developing new, innovative, and creative ideas to build our progress as a society.\n\nIn studying exceptionally creative people in history, some common traits in lifestyle and environment are often found. Creative people in history usually had supportive parents, but rigid and non-nurturing. Most had an interest in their field at an early age, and most had a highly supportive and skilled mentor in their field of interest. Often the field they chose was relatively uncharted, allowing for their creativity to be expressed more in a field with less previous information. Most exceptionally creative people devoted almost all of their time and energy into their craft, and after about a decade had a creative breakthrough of fame. Their lives were marked with extreme dedication and a cycle of hard-work and breakthroughs as a result of their determination.\n\nAnother theory of creative people is the \"investment theory of creativity\". This approach suggest that there are many individual and environmental factors that must exist in precise ways for extremely high levels of creativity opposed to average levels of creativity. In the \"investment\" sense, a person with their particular characteristics in their particular environment may see an opportunity to devote their time and energy into something that has been overlooked by others. The creative person develops an undervalued or under-recognised idea to the point that it is established as a new and creative idea. Just like in the financial world, some investments are worth the buy in, while others are less productive and do not build to the extent that the investor expected. This \"investment theory of creativity\" views creativity in a unique perspective compared to others, by asserting that creativity might rely to some extent on the right investment of effort being added to a field at the right time in the right way.\n\nMalevolent creativity (MC) focuses on the \"darker side\" of creativity. This type of creativity is not typically accepted within society and is defined by the intention to cause harm to others through original and innovative means. MC should be distinguished from negative creativity in that negative creativity may unintentionally cause harm to others, whereas MC is explicitly malevolently motivated. MC is often a key contributor to crime and in its most destructive form can even manifest as terrorism. However, MC can also be observed in ordinary day-to-day life as lying, cheating and betrayal. Although everyone shows some levels of MC under certain conditions, those that have a higher propensity towards malevolent creativity have increased tendencies to deceive and manipulate others to their own gain. Although levels of MC appear to dramatically increase when an individual is placed under unfair conditions, personality is also a key predictor in anticipating levels of malevolent thinking. Researches Harris and Reiter-Palmon investigated the role of aggression in levels of MC, in particular levels of implicit aggression and the tendency to employ aggressive actions in response to problem solving. The personality traits of physical aggression, conscientiousness, emotional intelligence and implicit aggression all seem to be related with MC. Harris and Reiter-Palmon's research showed that when subjects were presented with a problem that triggered malevolent creativity, participants high in implicit aggression and low in premeditation expressed the largest number of malevolently-themed solutions. When presented with the more benign problem that triggered prosocial motives of helping others and cooperating, those high in implicit aggression, even if they were high in impulsiveness, were far less destructive in their imagined solutions. They concluded premeditation, more than implicit aggression controlled an individual’s expression of malevolent creativity.\n\nThe current measure for malevolent creativity is the 13 item test Malevolent Creativity Behaviour Scale (MCBS) \n\nMalevolent creativity has strong links with crime. As creativity requires deviating from the conventional, there is a permanent tension between being creative and producing products that go too far and in some cases to the point of breaking the law. Aggression is a key predictor of malevolent creativity, and studies have also shown that increased levels of aggression also correlates to a higher likelihood of committing crime.\n\nCreativity is viewed differently in different countries. For example, cross-cultural research centred on Hong Kong found that Westerners view creativity more in terms of the individual attributes of a creative person, such as their aesthetic taste, while Chinese people view creativity more in terms of the social influence of creative people e.g. what they can contribute to society. Mpofu et al. surveyed 28 African languages and found that 27 had no word which directly translated to 'creativity' (the exception being Arabic). The principle of linguistic relativity, i.e. that language can affect thought, suggests that the lack of an equivalent word for 'creativity' may affect the views of creativity among speakers of such languages. However, more research would be needed to establish this, and there is certainly no suggestion that this linguistic difference makes people any less (or more) creative; Africa has a rich heritage of creative pursuits such as music, art, and storytelling. Nevertheless, it is true that there has been very little research on creativity in Africa, and there has also been very little research on creativity in Latin America. Creativity has been more thoroughly researched in the northern hemisphere, but here again there are cultural differences, even between countries or groups of countries in close proximity. For example, in Scandinavian countries, creativity is seen as an individual attitude which helps in coping with life's challenges, while in Germany, creativity is seen more as a process that can be applied to help solve problems.\n\nIt has been the topic of various research studies to establish that organizational effectiveness depends on the creativity of the workforce to a large extent. For any given organization, measures of effectiveness vary, depending upon its mission, environmental context, nature of work, the product or service it produces, and customer demands. Thus, the first step in evaluating organizational effectiveness is to understand the organization itself — how it functions, how it is structured, and what it emphasizes.\n\nAmabile argued that to enhance creativity in business, three components were needed:\n\nThere are two types of motivation:\n\nSix managerial practices to encourage motivation are:\n\nNonaka, who examined several successful Japanese companies, similarly saw creativity and knowledge creation as being important to the success of organizations. In particular, he emphasized the role that tacit knowledge has to play in the creative process.\n\nIn business, originality is not enough. The idea must also be appropriate—useful and actionable. Creative competitive intelligence is a new solution to solve this problem. According to Reijo Siltala it links creativity to innovation process and competitive intelligence to creative workers.\n\nCreativity can be encouraged in people and professionals and in the workplace. It is essential for innovation, and is a factor affecting economic growth and businesses. In 2013, the sociologist Silvia Leal Martín, using the Innova 3DX method, suggested measuring the various parameters that encourage creativity and innovation: corporate culture, work environment, leadership and management, creativity, self-esteem and optimism, locus of control and learning orientation, motivation, and fear.\n\nSimilarly, social psychologists, organizational scientists, and management scientists who conduct extensive research on the factors that influence creativity and innovation in teams and organizations have developed integrative theoretical models that emphasize the roles of team composition, team processes, and organizational culture, as well as the mutually reinforcing relationships between them in promoting innovation.\n\nThe investigation by Loo (2017) on creative working in the knowledge economy brings together studies of creativity as delineated in this web page. It offers connections with the sections on the ‘”Four C” model’, ‘Theories of creative processes’, ‘Creativity as a subset of intelligence’, ‘Creativity and personality’, and ‘In organisations’ It is the last section that the investigation addresses.\n\nResearch studies of the knowledge economy may be classified into three levels: macro, meso and micro. Macro studies refer to investigations at a societal or transnational dimension. Meso studies focus on organisations. Micro investigations centre on the minutiae workings of workers. There is also an interdisciplinary dimension such as research from businesses (e.g. Burton-Jones, 1999; Drucker, 1999), economics (e.g. Cortada, 1998; Reich, 2001; Florida, 2003), education (e.g. Farrell and Fenwick, 2007; Brown, Lauder and Ashton, 2011), human resource management (e.g. Davenport, 2005), knowledge and organizational management (Alvesson, 2004; Defillippi, Arthur and Lindsay, 2006; Orr, Nutley, Russell, Bain, Hacking and Moran, 2016), sociology, psychology, and knowledge economy-related sectors – especially information technology (IT) software (e.g. O’Riain, 2004; Nerland, 2008) and advertising (e.g. Grabher, 2004; Lury, 2004) (Loo, 2017).\n\nLoo (2017) studies how individual workers in the knowledge economy use their creativity and know-how in the advertising and IT software sectors. It examines this phenomenon across three developed countries of England, Japan and Singapore to observe global perspectives. Specifically, the study uses qualitative data from semi-structured interviews of the related professionals in the roles of creative directing and copywriting (in advertising), and systems software developing and software programme managing.\n\nThe study offers a conceptual framework (Loo, 2017, p. 49) of a two-dimensional matrix of individual and collaborative working styles, and single and multi-contexts. The investigation draws on literature sources from the four disciplines of economics (e.g. Reich, 2001; Quah, 2002), management (e.g. ,Drucker, 1994; Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995; von Hippel, 2006), sociology (e.g. Zuboff, 1988; Bell, 1973; Lash and Urry, 1994; Castells, 2000; Knorr Cetina, 2005), and psychology (e.g. Gardner, 1984; Csikszentmihalyi, 1988; Sternberg, Kaufman and Pretz, 2004). The themes arising from the analysis of knowledge work and creativity literature serve to create a distinct theoretical framework of creative knowledge work. These workers apply their cognitive abilities, creative personalities and skill sets in the areas of science, technology, or culture industries to invent or discover new possibilities – e.g. a medium, product or service. These work activities may be done individually or collectively. Education, training and ‘encultured environments’ are necessary for the performance of these creative activities. Acts of creativity are viewed as asking new questions over and above those questions asked by an intelligent person, seeking novelty when reviewing a situation (Gardner, 1993), and creating something that is different and novel, i.e. a ‘variation’ on the idea of existing ideas in a domain (Csikszentmihalyi, 1988). This framework is evidenced by the empirical chapters on the micro-workings of creative workers in the two knowledge economy sectors from global perspectives.\n\nThis investigation identifies a definition of creative work, three types of work and the necessary conditions for it to occur. These workers use a combination of creative applications including anticipatory imagination, problem-solving, problem seeking, and generating ideas and aesthetic sensibilities. Taking aesthetic sensibilities as an example, for a creative director in the advertising industry, it is a visual imagery whether still or moving via a camera lens, and for a software programmer, it is the innovative technical expertise in which the software is written. There are specific creative applications for each of the sectors such as emotional connection in the advertising sector, and the power of expression and sensitivity in the IT software sector. In addition to the creative applications, creative workers require abilities and aptitudes to carry out their roles. Passion for one’s job is generic. For copywriters, this passion is identified with fun, enjoyment and happiness alongside attributes such as honesty (regarding the product), confidence, and patience in finding the appropriate copy. Knowledge is also required in the disciplines of the humanities (e.g. literature), the creative arts (e.g. painting and music) and technical-related know-how (e.g. mathematics, computer sciences and physical sciences). In the IT software, technical knowledge of computer languages (e.g. C++) is especially significant for programmers whereas the degree of technical expertise may be less for a programme manager, as only knowledge of the relevant language is necessary to understand the issues for communicating with the team of developers and testers.\n\nThere are three types of work. One is intra-sectoral (e.g. ‘general sponge’ and ’in tune with the zeitgeist’ [advertising], and ‘power of expression’ and ‘sensitivity’ [IT software]). The second is inter-sectoral (e.g. ‘integration of advertising activities’ [advertising], and ‘autonomous decentralized systems’ [ADS] [IT software]). The third relates to changes in culture/practices in the sectors (e.g. ‘three-dimensional trust’ and ‘green credentials’ [advertising], and ‘collaboration with HEIs and industry’ and ‘ADS system in the Tokyo train operator’ [IT software]).\n\nThe necessary conditions for creative work to exist are a supportive environment such as supportive information, communications and electronic technologies (ICET) infrastructure, training, work environment and education.\n\nThis investigation has implications for lifelong learning of these workers informally and formally. Teaching institutions need to offer multi-disciplinary knowledge of humanities, arts and sciences and it has impacts on the programme structure, delivery approaches and assessments. At a macro level, governments need to offer a rich diet of cultural activities, outdoor activities and sports fixtures that inform potential creative workers in the areas of video gaming and advertising. This study has implications for work organisations that support and encourage collaborative working alongside individual working, offer opportunities to engage in continuous professional development (formally and informally), and foster an environment, which promotes experiential functioning and supports experimentation.\n\nTeam Composition\n\nDiversity between team members’ backgrounds and knowledge can increase team creativity by expanding the total collection of unique information that is available to the team and introducing different perspectives that can integrate in novel ways. However, under some conditions, diversity can also decrease team creativity by making it more difficult for team members to communicate about ideas and causing interpersonal conflicts between those with different perspectives. Thus, the potential advantages of diversity must be supported by appropriate team processes and organizational cultures in order to enhance creativity.\n\nTeam Processes\n\nTeam communication norms, such as respecting others’ expertise, paying attention to others’ ideas, expecting information sharing, tolerating disagreements, negotiating, remaining open to others’ ideas, learning from others, and building on each other’s ideas, increase team creativity by facilitating the social processes involved with brainstorming and problem solving. Through these processes, team members are able to access their collective pool of knowledge, reach shared understandings, identify new ways of understanding problems or tasks, and make new connections between ideas. Engaging in these social processes also promotes positive team affect, which facilitates collective creativity.\n\nOrganizational Culture\n\nSupportive and motivational environments that create psychological safety by encouraging risk taking and tolerating mistakes increase team creativity as well. Organizations in which help-seeking, help giving, and collaboration are rewarded promote innovation by providing opportunities and contexts in which team processes that lead to collective creativity can occur. Additionally, leadership styles that downplay status hierarchies or power differences within an organization and empower people to speak up about their ideas or opinions also help to create cultures that are conducive to creativity.\n\nEconomic approaches to creativity have focussed on three aspects — the impact of creativity on economic growth, methods of modelling markets for creativity, and the maximisation of economic creativity (innovation).\n\nIn the early 20th century, Joseph Schumpeter introduced the economic theory of \"creative destruction\", to describe the way in which old ways of doing things are endogenously destroyed and replaced by the new. Some economists (such as Paul Romer) view creativity as an important element in the recombination of elements to produce new technologies and products and, consequently, economic growth. Creativity leads to capital, and creative products are protected by intellectual property laws.\n\nMark A. Runco and Daniel Rubenson have tried to describe a \"psychoeconomic\" model of creativity. In such a model, creativity is the product of endowments and active investments in creativity; the costs and benefits of bringing creative activity to market determine the supply of creativity. Such an approach has been criticised for its view of creativity consumption as always having positive utility, and for the way it analyses the value of future innovations.\n\nThe \"creative class\" is seen by some to be an important driver of modern economies. In his 2002 book, \"The Rise of the Creative Class\", economist Richard Florida popularized the notion that regions with \"3 T's of economic development: Technology, Talent and Tolerance\" also have high concentrations of creative professionals and tend to have a higher level of economic development.\n\nSeveral different researchers have proposed methods of increasing the creativity of an individual. Such ideas range from the psychological-cognitive, such as Osborn-Parnes Creative Problem Solving Process, Synectics, science-based creative thinking, Purdue Creative Thinking Program, and Edward de Bono's lateral thinking; to the highly structured, such as TRIZ (the Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving) and its variant Algorithm of Inventive Problem Solving (developed by the Russian scientist Genrich Altshuller), and Computer-Aided morphological analysis.\n\nDaniel Pink, in his 2005 book \"A Whole New Mind\", repeating arguments posed throughout the 20th century, argues that we are entering a new age where creativity is becoming increasingly important. In this \"conceptual age\", we will need to foster and encourage \"right-directed thinking\" (representing creativity and emotion) over \"left-directed thinking\" (representing logical, analytical thought). However, this simplification of 'right' versus 'left' brain thinking is not supported by the research data.\n\nNickerson provides a summary of the various creativity techniques that have been proposed. These include approaches that have been developed by both academia and industry:\n\nSome see the conventional system of schooling as \"stifling\" of creativity and attempt (particularly in the preschool/kindergarten and early school years) to provide a creativity-friendly, rich, imagination-fostering environment for young children. Researchers have seen this as important because technology is advancing our society at an unprecedented rate and creative problem solving will be needed to cope with these challenges as they arise. In addition to helping with problem solving, creativity also helps students identify problems where others have failed to do so. See the Waldorf School as an example of an education program that promotes creative thought.\n\nPromoting intrinsic motivation and problem solving are two areas where educators can foster creativity in students. Students are more creative when they see a task as intrinsically motivating, valued for its own sake. To promote creative thinking, educators need to identify what motivates their students and structure teaching around it. Providing students with a choice of activities to complete allows them to become more intrinsically motivated and therefore creative in completing the tasks.\n\nTeaching students to solve problems that do not have well defined answers is another way to foster their creativity. This is accomplished by allowing students to explore problems and redefine them, possibly drawing on knowledge that at first may seem unrelated to the problem in order to solve it. In adults, mentoring individuals is another way to foster their creativiy. However, the benefits of mentoring creativity apply only to creative contributions considered great in a given field, not to everyday creative expression.\n\nIn the Scottish education system, creativity is identified as a core skillset for learning, life and work and is defined as “a process which generates ideas that have value to the individual. It involves looking at familiar things with a fresh eye, examining problems with an open mind, making connections, learning from mistakes and using imagination to explore new possibilities.” The need to develop a shared language and understanding of creativity and its role across every aspect of learning, teaching and continuous improvement was identified as a necessary aim and a set of four skills is used to allow educators to discuss and develop creativity skills across all subjects and sectors of education – curiosity, open—mindedness, imagination and problem solving. Distinctions are made between creative learning (when learners are using their creativity skills), creative teaching (when educators are using their creativity skills) and creative change (when creativity skills are applied to planning and improvement). Scotland’s national Creative Learning Plan supports the development of creativity skills in all learners and of educators’ expertise in developing creativity skills. A range of resources have been created to support and assess this including a national review of creativity across learning by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate for Education. \n\nCreativity has also been identified as one of the key 21st century skills and as one of the Four Cs of 21st century learning by educational leaders and theorists in the United States.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20734225", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20734225", "title": "Culture of Qatar", "text": "Culture of Qatar\n\nThe culture of Qatar is strongly influenced by traditional Bedouin culture, with less acute influence deriving from India, East Africa and elsewhere in the Persian Gulf. The peninsula's harsh climatic conditions compelled its inhabitants to turn to the sea for sustenance. Thus, there is a distinct emphasis placed on the sea in local culture. Literature and folklore themes are often related to sea-based activities. \n\nOral arts such as poetry and singing were historically more prevalent than figurative art because of the restrictions placed by Islam on depictions of sentient beings; however, certain visual art disciplines such as calligraphy, architecture and textile arts were widely practiced. Figurative arts were gradually assimilated into the country's culture during the oil era.\n\nSince 2016, Salah bin Ghanim Al Ali has been the Minister for Culture and Sports of Qatar.\n\nBecause of Islam's stance on figurative art, paintings and plastic arts played a relatively insignificant role in Qatari culture until the discovery of oil in the mid-20th century. Other visual arts such as calligraphy and architecture were the most historically dominant forms of Islamic visual expression. Calligraphy was most prized in society because of its close connection with Islam. Calligraphy is often used in the design of official state logos, for example, the Qatar National Vision 2030 logo.\n\nArt exhibitions were held under the auspices of the Ministry of Education until 1972, whereupon the state began providing its full support to the art scene. The Qatari Fine Arts Society was established in 1980 with the objective of promoting the works of Qatari artists. Yousef Ahmad is a leading figure of Qatar's art industry and regularly represents the country at international biennials and events. His art work has been displayed internationally.\nFor the last twenty years, several members of the Al Thani family have led Qatar’s interest and involvement into the field of arts and continue to shape the cultural policy of the country. Qatar was revealed to be the world's biggest art buyer in 2011 by The Art Newspaper.\n\nQatar Museums was established in the early 2000s to build and connect all museums and collections in Qatar. Two major museums lead the institution: the Museum of Islamic Art opened in 2008, and the , opened in Education City by Qatar Foundation in 2010.\n\nWhen a quartet comprising Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt severed all ties with and imposed a blockade of Qatar on 5 June 2017, Qatari artist Ahmed Al-Maadheed created an illustration known as \"Tamim Almajd\", which translates to \"Tamim the Glorious\". The illustration, a simple black and white sketch of Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani containing the text \"Tamim Almajd\" in the style of Arabic calligraphy, has become symbolic of Qatari nationalism. The image is now displayed prominently on buildings, in media and in art in Qatar.\n\nLocal folk stories were seldom documented, instead being passed down orally from generation to generation. After Qatar began profitting from oil exploration, the tradition of passing down these stories gradually ceased. Government ministries such as the Ministry of Culture and Sports and local universities have made efforts to preserve and transcribe local legends in publications.\n\nAmong Qatar's most noted folk heroes are Qatari ibn al-Fuja'a, a 7th-century war poet, and Rahmah ibn Jabir Al Jalhami, an 18th- and 19th-century pirate and transitory leader of Qatar. Recurring themes in Qatari folk tales are djinn, pearl diving, and the sea.\n\nOne myth that purportedly originates from Qatar is that of \"May and Gilan\", the latter of whom is said to be progenitor of the sail. According to tradition, in old times, a wealthy man named Ghilan resided in Al Khor. Besides commanding a crew of sailors and fishermen, he owned numerous pearling boats. As time passed, a woman named May who commanded superior number of boats and crewmen emerged as Ghilan's main adversary.\nIn an incident in which both crews were attempting to harvest the same pearl bed, May taunted Ghilan as her ship raced past his. This incensed Ghilan, who set out to discover a way to best his competitor. While observing a grasshopper, Ghilan took note of how its wings worked, and applied the same principle to his boats, giving rise to the sail. This enabled his boats to travel at higher speeds, allowing him to outpace May's boats to the densest pearl beds. The myth is typically presented in five sequences and is unlike most other known Bedouin stories. According to locals of Al Khor, the myth originated from the Al Muhannadi tribe of Al Khor. The story is not well-known elsewhere in Qatar.\n\nThe \"Lord of the Sea\" tale is famous in Qatar as well as the rest of the Persian Gulf region. The story revolves around a water djinn in the Persian Gulf named Bū Daryā who terrorizes sailors and pearl divers. It remains a well-known tale among Qatar's older population, particularly those who worked in maritime activities.\n\nQatari literature dates back to the 19th century with poets such as Abdul Jalil Al-Tabatabai and Mohammed bin Abdullah bin Uthaymeen. However, due to widespread illiteracy in the region at this time, local written literature dating back to the 19th century is scarce. \n\nThe modern literature movement in Qatar began in the 1950s, during the same time as the modern arts movement. This was largely because the increased prosperity from oil extraction activities allowed Qataris to receive formal education, adopt more settled lifestyles and attend higher education institutes abroad in order to hone their creative skills. Other factors involved in triggering a literary revolution were the improved social standing of women, the advent of a national identity, and the introductions of literary organisations, journalism and mass immigration. \n\nUnlike most other forms of art in Qatari society, females have been involved in the literature movement on a similar magnititude to males. Yousef Ni'ma introduced the first two collections of short stories in 1970, entitled \"Bint Al-Khaleej (Daughter of the Gulf)\" and \"Liqa fi Beirut (A Meeting in Bayrut)\". In the 1970s, much of the early work of females revolved around \"ritha\" poems which were published in local newspapers. Kaltham Jaber became the first Qatari woman to publish a collection of short stories, and the first Qatari woman writer to publish a major work when she released her anthology of short stories, dating from 1973 to the year of its publishing, 1978. Entitled \"Ania wa Ghabat as-Samt wa at-Taraddud\", the main focus of these stories is the desire for Qatari women to have a role in restructuring social norms and cultural conceptions.\nIn the late 20th and the 21st centuries, novels became popular among Qatari writers. Shu'a' Khalifa and her sister Dalal Khalifa were the first two Qatari novelists to publish their works. They accomplished this feat with the publishing of three separate novels in 1993: \"al-Ubur ila al-haqiqa (Passage to Truth)\", written by Shu'a' in 1987, Ahlam al-bahr al-qadima (The Old Dreams of the Sea), written by Shu'a' in 1990 and \"Usturat al-Insan wa-l-buhayra (The Myth of the Man and the Lake\", written by Dalal. Their novels center around social limitations faced by women, and scrutinize long-held social values. Another important theme in their novels is the rapid societal transition experienced by Qatar since the discovery of oil. \n\nAbdulaziz Al-Mahmoud published his maritime novel \"Al Qursan\" in August 2011, and it went on to become one of the best-selling books to be released by a Qatari author. By June 2015, twelve Qatari women and eight Qatari men had published a collective total of thirty-nine novels. Novels have proven to be one of the fastest growing categories of literature, with nearly a quarter of all existing Qatari-authored novels being published as recently as 2014. Six new female Qatari writers published novels in 2014. Similar to their predecessors, the main themes in their books are women's role in society and the social transition of Qatar.\n\nPoetry has been an integral part of the culture since pre-Islamic times. Qatari ibn al-Fuja'a, a folk hero dating to the seventh-century, was renowned for writing poetry. It was seen as a verbal art which fulfilled essential social functions. Having a renowned poet among its ranks was a source of pride for tribes; it is the primary way in which age-old traditions are passed down generations. Poems composed by females primarily focused on the theme of \"ritha\", to lament. This type of poetry served as an elegy.\n\nNabati was the primary form of oral poetry. In the nineteenth-century, sheikh Jassim Al Thani composed influential Nabati poems on the political conditions in Qatar. Nabati poems are broadcast on radio and televised in the country.\n\nThe folk music of Qatar has a close association with the sea. Songs related to pearl hunting are the most popular genre of male folk music. Each song, varying in rhythm, narrates a different activity of the pearling trip, including spreading the sails, diving, and rowing the ships. Collective singing was an integral part of each pearling trip, and each ship had a designated singer, known locally as \"al naham\".\n\nArdah, a folkloric dance, is still practiced in Qatar. The dance is performed with two rows of men opposite of one another, each of whom may or may not be wielding a sword, and is accompanied by drums and spoken poetry.\n\nHistorically, women primarily sang work songs associated with daily activities such as wheat grinding and cooking. The songs were performed collectively in small groups some pertained to general themes, whereas others were related to specific work processes. Women would also sing when returning pearl ships were sighted. After a sighting was made, they would gather around the seashore where they would clap and sing about the hardships of pearl diving.\n\nFootball is the most popular sport in regard to player base and spectatorship. Additionally, athletics, basketball, handball, volleyball, camel racing, horse racing, cricket and swimming are widely practiced. There are currently 11 multi-sports clubs in the country, and 7 single-sports clubs.\n\nPrior to the introduction of football, traditional games played were \"al dahroi\", \"al sabbah\", and \"taq taq taqiyyah\" for boys, and \"al kunatb\", \"al laqfah\" and \"nat al habl\" for girls. Variations of a family of board games known as mancala were played in previous decades. Two of the most popular board games were \"a’ailah\" and \"al haluwsah\". Other traditional sports practiced in the country include falconry, camel racing and hunting.\nHistorically camel racing was a tradition among the Bedouin tribes of Qatar and would be performed on special occasions such as weddings. It was not until 1972, one year after Qatar's independence, that camel racing was practiced on a professional level. Typically, camel racing season takes place from September to March. Approximately 22,000 racing camels are used in competitions which are mainly held at the country's primary camel racing venue, the Al-Shahaniya Camel Racetrack. The average distance of such races is usually 4 to 8 km depending on the conditions of the camels being raced.\n\nFalconry is widely practiced by Qataris. The only falconry association is Al Gannas, which was founded in 2008 in Katara and which hosts the Annual Falconry Festival. Hunting season extends from October to April. Prices of falcons can be extremely high, being as expensive as QR 1 million. Saluki dogs are also used for hunting in the desert primarily because of their great speeds. Their main prey in the desert are gazelles and rabbits.\n\nAs Qatar follows Shariah Law, alcohol and pork products cannot be brought into the country. Qatari cuisine reflects traditional Arab and Levantine cuisine. It is also heavily influenced by Iranian and Indian cuisine. Seafood and dates are staple food items. Machbūs, a meal consisting of rice, meat, and vegetables, is the national dish.\n\nAlcohol is not illegal in Qatar, but its sale and consumption is heavily regulated. Muslims are prohibited from purchasing and consuming alcohol. A liquor license is required to buy alcohol.\n\nQatari men wear thawbs (a long white shirt) over loose pants. They also wear a loose headdress, a ghutra, which comes in white or red and white. Around the ghutra is a black rope called an agal which holds it in place.\n\nQatari women generally wear customary dresses that include “long black robes” and black head cover \"hijab\", locally called \"bo'shiya\". However, the more traditional Sunni Muslim clothing for women are the black colored body covering known as the abayah together with the black scarf used for covering their heads known as the shayla. A burqa is sometimes worn to conceal their face.\n\nIt is believed that Qatari women began using face masks in the 19th century amid substantial immigration. As they had no practical ways of concealing their faces from foreigners, they began wearing the same type of face mask as their Persian counterparts.\n\nQatar's weekends are Friday and Saturday. Qatar National Day was changed from 3 September to 18 December in 2008. Notable holidays in the country are listed below:\n\nThere are currently seven newspapers in circulation in Qatar, with four being published in Arabic and three being published in English. Additionally, there are nine magazines.\nAll radio programmes from Qatar are state-owned and are amalgamated as the Qatar Broadcasting Service. Radio broadcasting in the country began in June 1968 and English transmissions started in December 1971 in order to accommodate the increasing non-Arabic speaking expat community. The QBS currently features radio stations in English, Arabic, French and Urdu.\n\nAl Jazeera, currently Qatar's largest television network, was founded in 1996 and has since become the foundation of the media sector. Initially launched as an Arabic news and current affairs satellite TV channel, Al Jazeera has since expanded into a network with several outlets, including the internet and specialty TV channels in multiple languages. The 'Al Jazeera effect' refers to the global impact of the Al Jazeera Media Network, particularly on the politics of the Arab world.\n\nThe multinational media conglomerate Al Jazeera Media Network is based in Doha with its wide variety of channels of which Al Jazeera Arabic, Al Jazeera English, Al Jazeera Documentary Channel, Al Jazeera Mubasher, beIN Sports Arabia and other operations are based in the TV Roundabout in the city.\n\nTerrestrial television stations now available on Nilesat include:\n\nDoha has a variety of radio stations, some of which include:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "41583262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41583262", "title": "Dairy (store)", "text": "Dairy (store)\n\nA dairy is a small owner-operated convenience store in New Zealand, licensed to sell groceries, milk, eggs, dairy products, perishables, newspapers and other staples during and after normal trading hours.\n\nThe term \"dairy\" came into common usage in New Zealand English to describe small shops by the late 1930s. Perishables such as milk and eggs were formerly delivered to city households from a dairy farm; by the late 1930s, small shops stocked such produce, and the term shifted to describe these shops. In addition to this meaning, New Zealand English retains the common meanings of \"dairy\", referring to milk, milk-derived products and associated industries.\n\nThe distinction between dairies, superettes and grocery stores has grown increasingly blurred in New Zealand English, a fact acknowledged by the Liquor Licensing Authority in 1991, and by the Law Commission. Contributing factors to this blurring of meanings include the deregulation of trading shop hours on Sundays, ambiguity over alcohol sales laws (see Sales of alcohol below), and the abolition of restrictions on types of goods permitted to be sold by dairies. The Law Commission summed up the ambiguity as follows:\n\nDairies rely on long hours rather than high mark-ups to make money, and are not overly profitable. As small operators, they cannot get bulk discounts that supermarkets get. As dairies must remain open long hours to stay profitable, they are almost always family-run businesses that utilise family members to run the shop.\nNew Zealand introduced the 40-hour working week in 1945, ending Saturday trading hours for most grocers. Dairies were allowed to stay open outside normal working hours and on Saturdays.\n\nDuring the 1990s and 2000s, dairies became less profitable as other stores made inroads into their niche as nearby stores open outside regular trading hours. As supermarkets opened for longer hours with the introduction of deregulated shopping hours in 1990, and petrol stations extended the range of goods they sold, dairies began to lose their competitive advantage.\n\nA 1994 study found that 227 of the 269 dairies in central Auckland were owned by Indians. Dairies are often self-owned by immigrants, who may face difficulties entering the workforce. Some dairy owners intended to give their children white collar or professional occupations, while other dairies had inter-generational ownership, with children taking over the store when they reach adulthood.\n\nThe role of dairies in New Zealand's immigrant Indian culture was explored in Jacob Rajan's 1997 play \"Krishnan's Dairy\", which toured internationally to positive reviews.\n\nThe Sale of Liquor Act (1989) prohibited the sale of liquor in \"any shop of a kind commonly known as a dairy\", without explicitly defining what a dairy was. In the wake of the act, dairies began altering their stock in order to qualify for a liquor license. This resulted in \"a proliferation of small stores distinguishable from dairies only because they are licensed to sell alcohol.\" The legislation contributed to the blurring distinction between dairies and grocery stores in New Zealand English.\n\nThe Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act 2012 sought to close this unintended loophole, clarifying the types of stores eligible to sell alcohol and ensuring dairies and convenience stores cannot sell alcohol. The law attracted criticism from dairy owners.\n\nThe Psychoactive Substances Act (2013) prohibits dairies from selling legal highs.\n\n"}
{"id": "30715282", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30715282", "title": "Dark Souls", "text": "Dark Souls\n\nDark Souls is an action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware and published by Namco Bandai Games. A spiritual successor to FromSoftware's \"Demon's Souls\", the game is the second installment in the \"Souls\" series. It was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in Japan by FromSoftware in September 2011 and worldwide by Namco Bandai Games in the following month. \"Dark Souls\" takes place in the fictional kingdom of Lordran, where players assume the role of a cursed undead character who begins a pilgrimage to discover the fate of their kind.\n\n\"Dark Souls\" received critical acclaim upon its release and is considered to be one of the best video games ever released, with critics praising the depth of its combat, intricate level design, and world lore. However, the game's difficulty received mixed reviews. While some praised the challenge it provides, others criticized it for being unnecessarily unforgiving. The Windows version of the game was less well received, with criticism directed at numerous technical issues.\n\nIn August 2012, a version of \"Dark Souls\" for Microsoft Windows, \"Dark Souls: Prepare To Die Edition\", was released. It featured additional content not seen in the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions. In October 2012, the additional content was released as downloadable content for consoles under the subtitle \"\". By April 2013, the game had sold over two million copies worldwide. A sequel to the game, \"Dark Souls II\", was released in 2014. A remastered version of the game, \"\", was released for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows, and Nintendo Switch in 2018.\n\n\"Dark Souls\" is a third-person action role-playing game. The core mechanic of the game is exploration. Players are encouraged by the game to proceed with caution, learn from past mistakes, or find alternative areas to explore. \"Dark Souls\" takes place in a large and continuous open world environment, connected through a central hub area (Firelink Shrine). Players are able to travel to and from areas and explore various paths at will, although certain prerequisites have to be met in order to unlock certain areas.\n\nThe central element to \"Dark Souls\" are Bonfires. Bonfires are scattered throughout the world and serve as checkpoints for each level. When rested at, the player is healed to full, healing charges are restored, but all of the enemies (except for bosses, mini-bosses, and specific characters) respawn. While resting, players can level up and perform other key functions.\n\nAnother aspect of \"Dark Souls\" is the \"humanity\" system. There are two \"forms\" the player character can be in during the game, human form and hollow form. Whenever the player dies in human form, they are returned to hollow form and can only have their humanity restored by consuming an item (also called a \"humanity\"). In order to gain the assistance of other players, the player must be in human form. While in human form, the player is subjected to invasions by other players and non-player characters (NPC) who seek to kill the player and restore their own humanity. Humanity can be acquired in many ways, and if no humanity is available, players are still able to progress in hollow form. Death in either form results in the loss of all carried souls and humanity, but players revive as hollows at their most recent bonfire with one chance at returning to where they died to recover all lost souls and humanity. If the player dies before reaching their \"bloodstain\", the souls and humanity they previously accrued are permanently lost.\n\nCommunication between players is deliberately restricted. Outside of character gestures, the only other communication players have with one another comes by way of orange soapstones, which allow players to write limited messages that can be read by others in the same area. In addition, players can enter co-cooperative or player versus player combat with each other. Throughout the game, there are multiple NPCs that the player may encounter on their journey. These characters add to the plot of the game but are not mandatory to engage with. If the player does choose to engage with them, the characters are able to assist the player by being able to be summoned for certain boss fights.\n\nDark Souls has a minimalist plot. Historical events in this world and their significance are often implicit and left to player interpretation rather than fully shown or explained. Most of the story is given to the player through dialogue from characters within the game, flavor text from items, and world design. The opening cutscene establishes the premise of the game. The world was once ruled by dragons. In this time period, a man known as Gwyn happens upon an object known as the \"First Flame\" and finds the \"Lord Souls\". He and his allies use their power to defeat the dragons, which starts the Age of Fire. Over time, the flames begin to fade with the rise of humans, and Gwyn sacrifices himself to prolong the Age of Fire. With the flame artificially rekindled, the undead curse begins to plague humanity, causing certain humans to continually resurrect upon death.\n\nThe game's protagonist is known as the chosen undead. After going through Sens Fortress, the chosen undead defeats the Iron Golem, and soon enters taken into Anor Londo. The Chosen Undead defeats Dragonslayer Ornstein and Executioner Smough and then enters a throne room of Gwynevere, who gives the chosen undead an object known as the \"Lordvessel\". Optionally, the player may encounter Darkstalker Kaathe who encourages the player not to link the fire but to let it die out and usher in the Age of Dark instead. Once the player acquires the Lord Souls, they travel to the Kiln of the First Flame to battle Gwyn. Once Gwyn has been defeated, the player is given the choice of linking the flame to preserve the Age of Fire, or letting it die out to instigate the Age of Dark.\n\nAt some point in the past, a being known as Manus awoke and began to spread the Abyss. Knight Artorias was sent to stop the spread of the Abyss, but he failed and became corrupted. Meanwhile, Manus searches desperately for his long-lost pendant across space and time. Once the player obtains the pendant, Manus pulls them into the past. There, the player destroys the corrupted Artorias and defeats Manus, halting the spread of the Abyss.\n\n\"Dark Souls\" was developed by FromSoftware, with series creator Hidetaka Miyazaki directing and producing. Following the game's release for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, many gamers expressed their hope for a PC version. International publisher Namco Bandai Games administrator Tony Shoupinou responded on their page that a PC version was possible. In early 2012, fans started a petition to bring \"Dark Souls\" to PC, with over 93,000 people signing it. A PC version of the game was confirmed in April 2012 via German magazine \"PC Action\". It had been reported during the development process that FromSoftware had been having difficulty with the port due to inexperience with PC as a platform and were focusing on new content rather than optimization. Re-branded as the \"Prepare To Die Edition\", it came out in August 2012 and featured new content, including bosses, enemies, equipment, and NPCs. The new content, titled \"Artorias of the Abyss\", was released for consoles in October 2012 in the form of DLC. Soon after, it was announced that \"Dark Souls\" for PC would use Games for Windows – Live for online play and DRM, spurring fan backlash.\n\nThe PC version was released on August 23, 2012. A user-created mod to circumvent the resolution cap, named \"DSFix\", appeared shortly after release. \"DSFix\" was later extended to become an unofficial fan-made patch which additionally allowed graphical improvements, raising the framerate cap to 60, and allowing the installation of custom texture mods.\n\nOn December 15, 2014, Games for Windows – Live was removed from the Steam version and replaced by Steamworks. The ability to transfer both achievements and save data was provided. In April 2016, \"Dark Souls\" became available on Xbox One via backward compatibility.\n\n\"Dark Souls\" received positive reviews from critics upon its release. One of the reviewers for \"Dark Souls\" described it as \"a very hardcore dark-fantasy [role-playing game]\" that is \"role-playing right down to the roots\", and stated that the \"massive field map and powerful enemies serve to rev up both your sense of adventure and your sense of dread\". Another reviewer stated that \"the sheer happiness you get after the trial-and-error pays off and you overcome the challenge is absolutely impossible to replicate.\"\n\nGameSpot scored \"Dark Souls\" a 9.5/10. Much praise was given to the online system, as well as the sense of jubilation felt when conquering boss fights after numerous failed attempts. They also suggested that casual gamers may struggle to progress, whereas role-playing game enthusiasts will thrive on the difficulty.\n\nIGN gave \"Dark Souls\" a 9.0/10, praising the well-thought-out level design, variety, strong emphasis on online features, excessively dark tone and atmosphere, and deep gameplay. While praising the extremely high difficulty, they stated that \"there's a difference between punishing, and downright unfair.\"\n\nEurogamer gave \"Dark Souls\" 9/10, praising the level design and atmosphere while noting that the game's difficulty might not appeal to casual gamers. Japanese publication Famitsu gave it a 37 out of 40 score.\n\nWriting for \"Slate\", Michael Thomsen asked if a 100-hour video game was ever worthwhile, stating:\n\nJason Killingsworth wrote a response to Thomsen's review for \"Edge\", arguing that the game's \"vertigo-inducing breadth makes it the gaming equivalent of a marathon\". Killingsworth praised the game's length and addictive nature.\n\n\"Edge\" later retroactively awarded the game 10 out of 10 in their October 2013 20th anniversary issue, stating that over time the breadth and quality of the game's design had overruled complaints about its difficulty.\n\nIn a review of the game, Ben \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw praised \"Dark Souls\" in his Zero Punctuation video for its deep gameplay and immersive atmosphere, but was \"disappointed\" with the late-game bosses and criticized the difficulty of getting into the game, stating that the difficulty would be a key factor in turning less new players off.\n\nPost-release, the game's director, Hidetaka Miyazaki, contemplated adding an easier difficulty level, stating that he was saddened by the fact that the difficulty deterred new players from playing the game. Namco Bandai claimed Miyazaki's statement was mistranslated and should have read \"This fact is really sad to me and I am thinking about how to make everyone complete the game while maintaining the current difficulty and carefully send all gamers the messages behind it.\"\n\nNamco Bandai's yearly financial report stated that the game sold 1.19 million units in the United States and Europe by March 2012. FromSoftware announced in April 2013 that the game had sold 2.37 million units worldwide.\n\nIn GameSpy's review, the port was referred to as \"shabby\", citing the game's limit of 30 frames per second, poor mouse and keyboard controls, and nonadjustable resolution, but the expanded content was praised, giving the game an overall favorable review. Eurogamer also commented on the quality of the port, stating: \"\"Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition\" does not come with the technical options you would expect from a well-engineered PC game, because it's a port of a console game, and that's all FromSoftware ever promised to deliver. Anyone who passes up Dark Souls for this reason is cutting off their nose to spite their neckbeard of a face.\" One of the producers of \"Dark Souls II\", Takeshi Miyazoe, responded to the criticism of the PC version by saying:\n\nThis is going to sound bad but our main priority was to get the game onto the PC as fast as possible, because people wanted it on the PC. The PC market in Japan is so minimal that originally there were no plans to make it on the PC, but with the strong petition from the North American and European fans, even with the lack of experience of working on a PC platform we still did our best to try to get it out as fast as possible. [The problems] were expected to a certain extent.\n\nWe did know there were PC-specific features like key-mapping and use of the mouse and keyboard, high resolution and higher frame rate, stuff like that, but... It's not that we ignored it, but it would have taken too much time for us to implement it, test it and get it up to the level people expected. It was more of a publisher (Namco Bandai) decision to say, ‘Guys, don’t worry about this – let’s just get it out and see how this works on PC.'\nGame Revolution gave \"Dark Souls\" the Community Choice Game of the Year award. IncGamers also gave it the \"Game of the Year\" award. Q-Games' Dylan Cuthbert and Double Fine Productions' Brad Muir chose \"Dark Souls\" as Game of the Year. \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\"s Eric L. Patterson chose it as Game of the Year. GameTrailers gave it the \"Best Role-Playing Game\" award, while also nominating it for the \"Best Multiplayer Game\", \"Best Trailer\" and \"Game of the Year\" awards. GameZone gave the game the \"Best Action/Adventure\" award and chose it as the runner-up for the \"Best RPG\" award.\n\n\"The Daily Telegraph\" gave the game the \"Best Integration of Online Features\" award, and nominated it for the awards of \"Best Director\" (Hidetaka Miyazaki), \"Best Level Design\", \"Best Sound Design\", \"Best Original Score\" (Motoi Sakuraba), \"Best Developer\" (FromSoftware), and \"Game of the Year\". TeamXbox gave it an honorable mention as the runner-up for the \"Best RPG\" award. 1UP.com gave it the \"Most Rewarding Game\" award. \"Game Informer\" gave it the award for \"Best Boss Fight\" (Sif). It also received the \"Best Boss Fights\" awards from GameSpot, including both the Editors' Choice and Readers' Choice awards. \"Famitsu\" gave it an Award of Excellence in its 2012 awards ceremony.\n\nIn 2013, Digital Spy named \"Dark Souls\" the best game of the seventh console generation. In 2014, \"Edge\" magazine named \"Dark Souls\" the best game of the seventh generation of game consoles, noting that while some may initially tire of it, \"We've yet to meet a single player for whom persistence has not been enough to transform apathy into all-consuming love.\" In September 2015, \"Dark Souls\" topped the magazine's special issue The 100 Greatest Videogames.\n\nIn 2015, the game placed first on GamesRadar's \"The 100 best games ever\" list. The game also placed first on USgamer's The 15 Best Games Since 2000 list. The game was titled the \"Best RPG on PC\" by Rock, Paper, Shotgun. In 2016, \"Dark Souls\" placed fifth on PC Gamer's \"Best RPGs of all time\" list.\n\n\"Dark Souls\" is often considered to be among the best games ever made. It is also considered one of the most influential video games of its generation. Games cited to have been influenced by \"Dark Souls\" include \"Destiny\", \"Alienation\", \"Lords of the Fallen\", \"Salt and Sanctuary\", \"Shovel Knight\", \"Titan Souls\", \"Enter the Gungeon\", \",\" \"Nioh\", \"God of War\", \"Journey\", and \"ZombiU\". \"Dark Souls\" was also cited as an inspiration for the television show \"Stranger Things\".\n\nA sequel, \"Dark Souls II\", was announced at the Spike Video Game Awards on December 7, 2012, for release on the PlayStation 3, the Xbox 360, and Microsoft Windows. Amid rumors of a possible decrease in the difficulty of the series due to comments made by the new director to \"Edge\", Brian Hong, global brand manager of Namco Bandai Games America, stated that \"Dark Souls II\" would be \"viciously hard\". \"Dark Souls II\" was released in early 2014. An updated version of it, subtitled \"Scholar of the First Sin\", was released in 2015 for the same platforms as well as the Xbox One and PlayStation 4. The third installment of the series, \"Dark Souls III\", was released in early 2016. Two downloadable content packs were released for this game: \"Ashes of Ariandel\", on October 25, 2016, followed by \"The Ringed City\" on March 28, 2017.\n\nA remastered version of the game, titled \"Dark Souls: Remastered\", was released worldwide for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Windows in May 2018, with a Nintendo Switch version being released on October 19, 2018. The remaster was ported by the Polish studio QLOC, whereas the Switch version was ported by Virtuos. The game runs at a native 60 frames per second on all platforms except the Nintendo Switch, and supports 4K resolution on the PlayStation 4 Pro, Xbox One X, and Windows. A number of changes were made to the online multiplayer, including the addition of dedicated servers, the maximum number of players online increased from four to six, and the addition of password matchmaking, first introduced in \"Dark Souls III\".\n\n\"Dark Souls: Remastered\" received \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Critics praised the improved visuals and performance, while criticism was directed towards the lack of an effective anti-cheat system and the PC version's price despite few significant changes. It sold 71,739 copies in Japan during the week of its release, making it the best-selling game in the country at the time.\n\n"}

Unlike the first three series, the main characters, the DigiDestined merge with ancient spirits known as \"Legendary Warriors\" to become Digimon themselves, instead of training. Like \"Digimon Tamers\", the climax features any human fusing each partner as a Mega form. The series aired in Japan from April 7, 2002 to March 30, 2003, with an English-language version, produced by Sensation Animation, airing in North America from September 9, 2002 to July 14, 2003. It was the last season to use the \"Digital Monsters\" title as subsequent series, beginning with \"Digimon Data Squad\" and using unique localized titles.\n\nIn the events prior to the series, a group of ten Digimon creatures from the \"Digital World\", a parallel universe originated from Earth's various communication networks, sacrificed themselves to defeat an ultimate evil for invading their world. These Digimon collectively known as \"Legendary Warriors\" created artifacts from their data, the twenty \"Spirits\" (ten Human Spirits and Beast Spirits for each elements), before leaving the Digital World in the care of three Celestial Digimon, Ophanimon, Cherubimon and Seraphimon. However, Cherubimon betrays them. To counter this, Ophanimon summons five children.\n\nThe five DigiDestined find their respective Human Spirits and merge with them to \"Spirit Evolve\" into Digimon themselves. While finding each of their Beast Spirits, they meet five other Legendary Warriors, who serve Cherubimon. After defeating them (the rest of them destroy one and Koji takes another Beast Spirit), Koji notices that Cherubimon and Koichi are opposing them. Takuya and his friends free Koichi, restores his power, and allows him to join them. They rescue Ophanimon. However, she sacrifices herself to save them. Ophanimon upgrades Takuya and Koji's D-Tectors, with the last of her strength to allow them to Unity Spirit Evolve. After defeating Cherubimon, the DigiDestined learn that Lucemon is sealed within the Digital World's core. Two Royal Knights, Dynasmon and Crusadermon, scan all of the world's data to awaken Lucemon. Takuya and Koji defeat the knights, just as they scan the Digital World. When Lucemon frees himself, he opens a portal to the real world. After Koichi sacrifices his power, Lucemon leaves the Digital World. While all spirits combine to form into the ultimate Legendary Warrior Digimon Susanoomon, Lucemon arrives at the real world. After reviving Ophanimon, Cherubimon and Seraphimon, Susanoomon destroys Lucemon, recovering the data and restoring the Digital World. The children return to the real world and realize that an hour did not pass. They save Koichi by using the power of D-Tectors, before it reverts into cell phones. Takuya and his friends embrace their future.\n\nToei Animation announced the production of a fourth \"Digimon\" series in February 2002 and was set to start in April, after \"Tamers\". \"Digimon Frontier\" was conceived by Fuji TV's , 's Kyōtarō Kimura, and . The series was directed by Yukio Kaizawa, who had previously worked on some \"Bikkuriman\" shows and certain \"One Piece\" episodes. It was chiefly written by Sukehiro Tomita, while character designs were done by .\n\n\"Digimon Frontier\" aired in Japan on Fuji TV from April 7, 2002 to March 30, 2003. The show's opening theme song is \"Fire!!\" by Kōji Wada, which peaked at #75 on the Oricon Weekly Singles Chart. The ending theme songs are by Wada for the first half and \"An Endless Tale\" by Wada and AiM for the second half. The insert songs featured in the show are \"With the Will\" by Kōji Wada, which served as the Spirit Evolution theme, and \"The Last Element\" by Ayumi Miyazaki, which was the theme song for Unified Spirit Evolution.\nAn English-language version, produced by Sensation Animation and recorded by Studiopolis, aired in North America as the fourth season to \"Digimon: Digital Monsters\". It aired on UPN, ABC Family, and YTV between September 9, 2002 and July 14, 2003. \"Digimon Frontier\" appeared on ABC Family as part of a package deal with \"Digimon Tamers\" from when Disney had acquired the rights from Saban Entertainment. UPN aired the show until late August 2003, when they severed their ties to Disney. The dubbed version featured an original soundtrack, sound effects, character name changes and edits pertaining to content scenes thought to be inappropriate for all audiences. The theme song of the English version was produced by Chris Horvath. In addition to the theme song, the show also featured music by Deddy Tzur and Inon Zur.\n\nThe series was originally scheduled to air on Jetix in the United Kingdom. However, the series was put on hold and was never broadcast by the time the channel ended in August 2009. New Video Group released a complete DVD box set of English-dubbed \"Digimon Frontier\" on September 10, 2013 in the US, and a DVD collection with all \"Digimon\" shows up to \"Frontier\" on October 22, 2013. Out of fan requests, the UK got a release of \"Frontier\" on October 29, 2018.\n\nIn addition to the television series, a film adaptation titled \"\" was produced. It had the same writer, composer and character design from the TV show, but was directed by Takahiro Imamura. The film premiered at Toei's Summer Anime Fair on July 20, 2002 along with three other productions. Although the fair was deemed a box office failure, earning 800 million yen (US$6.8m)—whereas last edition earned 2 billion yen—, the film alone grossed half of it, 460 million yen. The film aired on American Jetix on November 27, 2005, and reruns were broadcast on Toon Disney in 2007.\n\nA drama CD titled was released on April 23, 2003 and is centered on each of the Legendary Warriors sending messages to each other.

This examines how choice of design methodology contributes to the success or failure of education reforms through studies in Thailand. It is related to the theories of situated learning and of constructionist learning. The term constructionism was coined by Seymour Papert under whom Cavallo studied. Emergent Design holds that education systems cannot adapt effectively to technology change unless the education is rooted in the existing skills and needs of the local culture.\n\nThe most notable non-theoretical application of the principles of emergent design is in the OLPC, whose concept work is supported in Cavallo's paper \"Models of growth — towards fundamental change in learning environment\".\n\nEmergent design is a consistent topic in agile software development, as a result of the methodology's focus on delivering small pieces of working code with business value. With emergent design, a development organization starts delivering functionality and lets the design emerge. Development will take a piece of functionality A and implement it using best practices and proper test coverage and then move on to delivering functionality B. Once B is built, or while it is being built, the organization will look at what A and B have in common and refactor out the commonality, allowing the design to emerge. This process continues as the organization continually delivers functionality. At the end of an agile release cycle, development is left with the smallest set of the design needed, as opposed to the design that could have been anticipated in advance. The end result is a simpler design with a smaller code base, which is more easily understood and maintained and naturally has less room for defects.. Practices like Change Vector Tracking has helped teams adopting Emergent design as their design philosophy more systematic, disciplined and pragmatic.\n\nEmergent Design is also being used in social change movements, such as a group of Canadian NGOs that are bringing together a group of civic leaders to discuss how their work scales up and scales deep. A series of events are being organized by the Carold Institute and in 2013 through to 2015. The project goals currently include, but are not limited to:\n\n"}

{"id": "2732241", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2732241", "title": "Food miles", "text": "Food miles\n\nFood miles is the distance food is transported from the time of its production until it reaches the consumer. Food miles are one factor used when assessing the environmental impact of food, including the impact on global warming.\n\nThe concept of food miles originated in the early 2018s in the United Kingdom. It was conceived by Professor Tim Lang at the Sustainable Agriculture Food and Environment (SAFE) Alliance and first appeared in print in a report “The Food Miles Report: The dangers of long-distance food transport”, researched and written by Angela Paxton.\n\nSome scholars believe that an increase in the distance food travels is due to the globalization of trade; the focus of food supply bases into fewer, larger districts; drastic changes in delivery patterns; the increase in processed and packaged foods; and making fewer trips to the supermarket. These make a small part of the greenhouse gas emissions created by food; 83% of overall emissions of CO are in production phases.\n\nSeveral studies compare emissions over the entire food cycle, including production, consumption, and transport. These include estimates of food-related emissions of greenhouse gas 'up to the farm gate' versus 'beyond the farm gate'. In the UK, for example, agricultural-related emissions may account for approximately 40% of the overall food chain (including retail, packaging, fertilizer manufacture, and other factors), whereas greenhouse gases emitted in transport account for around 12% of overall food-chain emissions. Researchers are currently working to provide the public with more information.\n\nThe concept of \"food miles\" has been criticised, and food miles are not always correlated with the actual environmental impact of food production. In comparison, the percentage of total energy used in home food preparation is 26% and in food processing is 29%, far greater than transportation.\n\nThe concept of food miles is part of the broader issue of sustainability which deals with a large range of environmental, social and economic issues, including local food. The term was coined by Tim Lang (now Professor of Food Policy, City University, London) who says: \"The point was to highlight the hidden ecological, social and economic consequences of food production to consumers in a simple way, one which had objective reality but also connotations.\" The increased distance traveled by food in developed countries was caused by the globilization of food trade, which increased by 4 times since 1961. Food that is transported by road produces more carbon emissions than any other form of transported food. Road transport produces 60% of the world's food transport carbon emissions. Air transport produces 20% of the world's food transport carbon emissions. Rail and sea transport produce 10% each of the world's food transport carbon emissions.\n\nAlthough it was never intended as a complete measure of environmental impact, it has come under attack as an ineffective means of finding the true environmental impact. For example, a DEFRA report in 2005 undertaken by researchers at AEA Technology Environment, entitled \"The Validity of Food Miles as an Indicator of Sustainable Development\", included findings that \"the direct environmental, social and economic costs of food transport are over £9 billion each year, and are dominated by congestion.\" The report also indicates that it is not only how far the food has travelled but the method of travel in all parts of the food chain that is important to consider. Many trips by personal cars to shopping centres would have a negative environmental impact compared to transporting a few truckloads to neighbourhood stores that can be easily reached by walking or cycling. More emissions are created by the drive to the supermarket to buy air freighted food than was created by the air freighting in the first place. Also, the positive environmental effects of organic farming may be compromised by increased transportation, unless it is produced by local farms. The Carbon Trust notes that to understand the carbon emissions from food production, all the carbon-emitting processes that occur as a result of getting food from the field to our plates need to be considered, including production, origin, seasonality and home care.\n\nA recent study led by Professor Miguel Gomez (Applied Economics and Management), at Cornell University and supported by the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future found that in many instances, the supermarket supply chain did much better in terms of food miles and fuel consumption for each pound compared to farmers markets. It suggests that selling local foods through supermarkets may be more economically viable and sustainable than through farmers markets.\n\nWith processed foods that are made of many different ingredients, it is very complicated, though not impossible, to calculate the CO2 emissions from transport by multiplying the distance travelled of each ingredient, by the carbon intensity of the mode of transport (air, road or rail). However, as both Prof. Lang and the original Food Miles report noted, the resulting number – although interesting, cannot give the whole picture of how sustainable – or not – a food product is.\n\nWal-Mart publicized a press releasing that stated food traveled 1500 miles before it reaches customers. The shocking statistics aroused public concern about food miles. According to Jane Black, a food writer who covers food politics, the number was derived from a small database. The 22 terminal markets from which the data was collected handled 30% of the United States produce.\n\nAccording to Oxfam researchers, there are many other aspects of the agricultural processing and the food supply chain that also contribute to greenhouse gas emissions which are not taken into account by simple \"food miles\" measurements. There are benefits to be gained by improving livelihoods in poor countries through agricultural development. Smallholder farmers in poor countries can often improve their income and standard of living if they can sell to distant export markets for higher value horticultural produce, moving away from the subsistence agriculture of producing staple crops for their own consumption or local markets.\n\nHowever, exports from poor countries do not always benefit poor people. Unless the product has a Fairtrade label, or a label from another robust and independent scheme, food exports might make a bad situation worse. Only a very small percentage of what importers pay will end up in the hands of plantation workers. Wages are often very low and working conditions bad and sometimes dangerous. Sometimes the food grown for export takes up land that had been used to grow food for local consumption, so local people can go hungry.\n\nResearchers say a more complete environmental assessment of food that consumers buy needs to take into account how the food has been produced and what energy is used in its production. A recent DEFRA case study indicated that tomatoes grown in Spain and transported to the United Kingdom may have a lower carbon footprint in terms of energy than heated greenhouses in the United Kingdom.\n\nAccording to German researchers, the food miles concept misleads consumers because the size of transportation and production units is not taken into account. Using the methodology of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in accordance with ISO 14040, entire supply chains providing German consumers with food were investigated, comparing local food with food of European and global provenance. Large-scale agriculture reduces unit costs associated with food production and transportation, leading to increased efficiency and decreased energy use per kilogram of food by economies of scale. Research from the Justus Liebig University Giessen show that small food production operations may cause even more environmental impact than bigger operations in terms of energy use per kilogram, even though food miles are lower. Case studies of lamb, beef, wine, apples, fruit juices and pork show that the concept of food miles is too simple to account for all factors of food production. \n\nA 2006 research report from the Agribusiness and Economics Research Unit at Lincoln University, New Zealand counters claims about food miles by comparing total energy used in food production in Europe and New Zealand, taking into account energy used to ship the food to Europe for consumers. The report states, \"New Zealand has greater production efficiency in many food commodities compared to the UK. For example New Zealand agriculture tends to apply fewer fertilizers (which require large amounts of energy to produce and cause significant CO2 emissions) and animals are able to graze year round outside eating grass instead of large quantities of brought-in feed such as concentrates. In the case of dairy and sheep meat production NZ is by far more energy efficient, even including the transport cost, than the UK, twice as efficient in the case of dairy, and four times as efficient in case of sheep meat. In the case of apples, NZ is more energy-efficient even though the energy embodied in capital items and other inputs data was not available for the UK.\"\n\nOther researchers have contested the claims from New Zealand. Professor Gareth Edwards-Jones has said that the arguments “in favour of New Zealand apples shipped to the UK is probably true only or about two months a year, during July and August, when the carbon footprint for locally grown fruit doubles because it comes out of cool stores.”\n\nStudies by Dr. Christopher Weber et al. of the total carbon footprint of food production in the U.S. have shown transportation to be of minor importance, compared to the carbon emissions resulting from pesticide and fertilizer production, and the fuel required by farm and food processing equipment.\n\nFarm animals account for between 20% and 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions. That figure includes the clearing of land to feed and graze the animals. Clearing land of trees, and cultivation, are the main drivers of farming emissions. Deforestation eliminates carbon sinks, accelerating the process of climate change. Cultivation, including the use of synthetic fertilisers, releases greenhouse gases such as nitrous oxide. Nitrogen fertiliser is especially demanding of fossil fuels, as producing a tonne of it takes 1.5 tonnes of oil.\n\nMeanwhile, it’s increasingly recognised that meat and dairy are the largest sources of food-related emissions. The UK’s consumption of meat and dairy products (including imports) accounts for about 8% of national greenhouse gas emissions related to consumption.\n\nAccording to a study by engineers Christopher Weber and H. Scott Matthews of Carnegie Mellon University, of all the greenhouse gases emitted by the food industry, only 4% comes from transporting the food from producers to retailers. The study also concluded that adopting a vegetarian diet, even if the vegetarian food is transported over very long distances, does far more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, than does eating a locally grown diet. They also concluded that \"Shifting less than one day per week’s worth of calories from red meat and dairy products to chicken, fish, eggs, or a vegetable-based diet achieves more GHG reduction than buying all locally sourced food.\" In other words, the amount of red meat consumption is much more important than food miles.\n\nA commonly ignored element is the last mile. For example, a gallon of gasoline could transport 5 kg of meat over by road (40 tonner at 8 mpg) in bulk transport, or it could transport a single consumer only 30 or to buy that meat. Thus foods from a distant farm that are transported in bulk to a nearby store consumer can have a lower footprint than foods a consumer picks up directly from a farm that is within driving distance but farther away than the store. This can mean that doorstep deliveries of food by companies can lead to lower carbon emissions or energy use than normal shopping practices. Relative distances and mode of transportation make this calculation complicated. For example, consumers can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of the last mile by walking, bicycling, or taking public transport. Another impact is that goods being transported by large ships very long distances can have lower associated carbon emissions or energy use than the same goods traveling by truck a much shorter distance.\n\nLifecycle analysis, a technique that meshes together a wide range of different environmental criteria including emissions and waste, is a more holistic way of assessing the real environmental impact of the food we eat. The technique accounts for energy input and output involved in the production, processing, packaging and transport of food. It also factors in resource depletion, air pollution and water pollution and waste generation/municipal solid waste.\n\nA number of organisations are developing ways of calculating the carbon cost or lifecycle impact of food and agriculture. Some are more robust than others but, at the moment, there is no easy way to tell which ones are thorough, independent and reliable, and which ones are just marketing hype.\n\nEven a full lifecycle analysis accounts only for the environmental effects of food production and consumption. However it is one of the widely agreed three pillars of sustainable development, namely environmental, social and economic.\n\nfoodpocketstats/FoodPocketbook2009.pdf.\nLondon/Medway, Kent.\n\n"}

{"id": "1083601", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1083601", "title": "Hong Kong English", "text": "Hong Kong English\n\nHong Kong English () is the dialect of the English language most commonly used in Hong Kong. The dialect is a result of Hong Kong's British overseas territory history and the influence of native Cantonese speakers.\n\nBeing a former British colony, Hong Kong predominantly uses British spellings. Pronunciations and words are also predominantly British, although influences from American, Canadian and Australian English do exist as a result of Hollywood movies, TV and Internet culture. In fact, a lot of Hong Kong Chinese families migrated to (in alphabetical order) Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand and the United States in the 1990s after Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 in mainland China, and when they move back they are less likely to use British English. There is also an influence from the significant non-Chinese demographic (e.g., expats and maids). The Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority accepts \"all varieties of English\" as \"[e]xaminers come from many different places.\" According to article 9 of the Hong Kong Basic Law, \"English may also be used as an official language\" but the law does not specify which type of English.\n\nCantonese English, locally referred to as Chinglish, in theory, refers to the accent and characteristics of English spoken by native Hong Kongers and other Cantonese people. Overall, it is primarily spoken by native Hong Kong language (Cantonese) speakers. Therefore, although it is called \"Hong Kong English\", it is not only spoken in Hong Kong. People who come from Macau, Guangzhou, or whose first language is Cantonese speak it.\n\nEnglish is one of the official languages in Hong Kong, and is used widely in the Government, academic circles, business and the courts. All road and government signs are bilingual and English is as equally valid as Chinese in legal and business standings. English is what distinguished most and those who spoke English or were taught English were considered the elite, meaning those able to be taught English were considered upperclassmen. This conceptualized way of thinking arose in 1984. This dialect is its own category and is the standard in Hong Kong.\nPeople with higher education, past experience of living in English-speaking countries, or who constantly interact with Hong Kong's English-speaking expatriate communities, generally speak an acquired form of English. Accent and spelling preference may vary from person to person, depending on the people they have interacted with and the country they have studied in. For most ordinary local Hong Kongers however, the English spoken is generally typical of foreign language learners: Cantonese-influenced pronunciation with some acquired Received Pronunciation characteristics, and with vocabularies and sentence structure generally more formal than those of native speakers. For instance, contractions and slang are not used, and many idioms are alien to Hong Kongers because the terms pertain more to the cultures of English-speaking countries.\nThe falling English proficiency of local English language teachers has come under criticism.\n\nSince the Handover, English in Hong Kong remains primarily a second language, in contrast to Singapore where English has been shifting toward being a first language.\n\nThirty-five years ago, it was argued that there was no such thing as Hong Kong English, but nowadays its status is much more established. In the Dynamic Model of Postcolonial Englishes, it has been classified as in the third phase, that of Nativization, but more recently it has been shown that many young people are happy to identify themselves as speakers of Hong Kong English, so it might be regarded as progressing into the fourth phase, that of Endonormative Stabilization. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that Hong Kong English is highly intelligible to listeners from elsewhere, which helps explain why an increasing number of people are happy to be identified as speakers of this variety.\n\nAlthough it may be assumed that, as a result of the colonial legacy, the pronunciation of Hong Kong English was originally based on British English, in fact nowadays there are many features of pronunciation derived from American English, and indeed the influence of American English appears to be increasing. Furthermore, there seem to be some innovative developments that are unique to Hong Kong English, such as a split in the realisation of /v/ as [f] or [w]. Some of the more salient features are listed below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome words and phrases widely understood in Hong Kong are rare or unheard of elsewhere. These often derive from Chinese, Anglo-Indian or Portuguese/Macanese.\n\nResearch is also being done on the generation of new Hong Kong English vocabulary driven by computer mediated communication between bilingual Cantonese and English speakers. Rather than using complicated Chinese character keyboard interfaces, Hong Kong English speakers will text and email English translations to the point that the English word often gains independent usage.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "933515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=933515", "title": "Horse meat", "text": "Horse meat\n\nHorse meat is the culinary name for meat cut from a horse. It is a major meat in only a few countries, notably in Central Asia, but it forms a significant part of the culinary traditions of many others, from Europe to South America to Asia. The top eight countries consume about 4.7 million horses a year. For the majority of humanity's early existence, wild horses were hunted as a source of protein.\n\nBecause of the role horses have played as companions and as workers, and ensuing concerns about the ethics of the horse slaughter process, it is a taboo food in some cultures. These historical associations, as well as ritual and religion, led to the development of an aversion to the consumption of horse meat. The horse is now given pet status by many in some parts of the Western world, particularly in the United States, United Kingdom, and Ireland, which further solidifies the taboo on eating its meat.\n\nIn the Paleolithic, wild horses formed an important source of food. In many parts of Europe, the consumption of horse meat continued throughout the Middle Ages until modern times, despite a papal ban of horse meat in 732. Horse meat was also eaten as part of Germanic pagan religious ceremonies in northern Europe, particularly ceremonies associated with the worship of Odin.\n\nHorses evolved on the North American continent, and by about 12,000 years ago, migrated to other parts of the world, becoming extinct in the Americas. The Hagerman horse, about the size of a modern-day large pony, is one example, found in Idaho at the Hagerman Fossil Beds, a national monument. In the 15th and 16th centuries, Spaniards, followed by other European settlers, re-introduced horses to the Americas. Some horses became feral and were hunted by the indigenous Pehuenche people of what is now Chile and Argentina. At first, they hunted horses as they did other game, but later they began to raise them for meat and transport. The meat was, and still is, preserved by being sun-dried in the high Andes into a product known as \"charqui\".\n\nFrance dates its taste for horse meat to the Revolution. With the fall of the aristocracy, its auxiliaries had to find new means of subsistence. Just as hairdressers and tailors set themselves up to serve commoners, the horses maintained by aristocracy as a sign of prestige ended up alleviating the hunger of lower classes. During the Napoleonic campaigns, the surgeon-in-chief of Napoleon's Grand Army, Baron Dominique-Jean Larrey, advised the starving troops to eat the meat of horses. At the siege of Alexandria, the meat of young Arab horses relieved an epidemic of scurvy. At the battle of Eylau in 1807, Larrey served horse as soup and \"bœuf à la mode\". At Aspern-Essling (1809), cut off from the supply lines, the cavalry used the breastplates of fallen \"cuirassiers\" as cooking pans and gunpowder as seasoning, and thus founded a tradition that carried on until at least the Waterloo campaign.\n\nHorse meat gained widespread acceptance in French cuisine during the later years of the Second French Empire. The high cost of living in Paris prevented many working-class citizens from buying meat such as pork or beef, so in 1866, the French government legalized the eating of horse meat, and the first butcher's shop specializing in horse meat opened in eastern Paris, providing quality meat at lower prices. During the Siege of Paris (1870–1871), horse meat, along with the meat from donkeys and mules, was eaten by anyone who could afford it, partly because of a shortage of fresh meat in the blockaded city, and also because horses were eating grain which was needed by the human populace. Though there were large numbers of horses in Paris (estimates suggested between 65,000 and 70,000 were butchered and eaten during the siege) the supplies were ultimately limited. Not even champion racehorses were spared (two horses presented to Napoleon III by Alexander II of Russia were slaughtered) but the meat became scarce. Many Parisians gained a taste for horse meat during the siege, and after the war ended, horse meat remained popular. Likewise, in other places and times of siege or starvation, horses are viewed as a food source of last resort.\n\nDespite the general Anglophone taboo, horse and donkey meat was eaten in Britain, especially in Yorkshire, until the 1930s, and in times of postwar food shortage surged in popularity in the United States and was considered for use in hospitals. A 2007 \"Time\" magazine article about horse meat brought in from Canada to the United States characterized the meat as sweet, rich, superlean, oddly soft meat, and closer to beef than venison.\n\nHorse is commonly eaten in many countries in Europe and Asia. It is not a generally available food in some English-speaking countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia, Ireland, the United States, and English Canada. It is also taboo in Brazil, Israel, and among the Romani people and Jewish people the world over. Horse meat is not generally eaten in Spain, except in the north, although the country exports horses both live animals and slaughtered meat for the French and Italian markets. Horse meat is consumed in some North American and Latin American countries, and is illegal in some countries. For example, the Food Standards Code of Australia and New Zealand definition of 'meat' does not include horse. In Tonga, horse meat is eaten nationally, and Tongan emigrants living in the United States, New Zealand, and Australia have retained the taste for it, claiming Christian missionaries originally introduced it to them.\n\nIn Islamic law, consuming horse meat is Halal. The consumption of horse meat has been common in Central Asia societies, past or present, due to the abundance of steppes suitable for raising horses. In North Africa, horse meat has been occasionally consumed, but almost exclusively by the Christian Copts and the Hanafi Sunnis (a common form of Islam in Central Asia and Turkey), but has never been eaten in the Maghreb.\n\nHorse meat is forbidden by Jewish dietary laws because horses do not have cloven hooves and they are not ruminants.\n\nIn the eighth century, Popes Gregory III and Zachary instructed Saint Boniface, missionary to the Germans, to forbid the eating of horse meat to those he converted, due to its association with Germanic pagan ceremonies. The people of Iceland allegedly expressed reluctance to embrace Christianity for some time, largely over the issue of giving up horse meat. Horse meat is now currently consumed in Iceland, and many horses are raised for this purpose. The culturally close people of Sweden still have an ambivalent attitude to horse meat, said to stem from this time.\n\nHenry Mayhew describes the difference in the acceptability and use of the horse carcass in London and Paris in \"London Labour and the London Poor\" (1851). Horse meat was rejected by the British but continued to be eaten in other European countries such as France and Germany, where knackers often sold horse carcasses despite the papal ban. Even the hunting of wild horses for meat continued in the area of Westphalia. Londoners also suspected that horse meat was finding its way into sausages and that offal sold as that of oxen was in fact equine.\n\nWhile no taboo on eating horse meat exists \"per se\", it is generally considered by ethnic Russians to be a low-quality meat with poor taste, and it is rarely found in stores.\n\nIt is popular among such peoples as Tatars, Yakuts, Kyrgyzs, and Kazakhs.\n\nIn 732 AD, Pope Gregory III began a concerted effort to stop the ritual consumption of horse meat in pagan practice. In some countries, the effects of this prohibition by the Roman Catholic Church have lingered, and horse meat prejudices have progressed from taboos, to avoidance, to abhorrence. In a study conducted by Fred Simoons, the avoidance to horse meat in American culture is less likely due to lingering feelings from Gregory's prohibition and instead due to an unfamiliarity with the meat compared to more mainstream offerings. In other parts of the world, horse meat has the stigma of being something poor people eat and is seen as a cheap substitute for other meats, such as pork and beef.\n\nAccording to the anthropologist Marvin Harris, some cultures class horse meat as taboo because the horse converts grass into meat less efficiently than ruminants.\n\nTotemistic taboo is also a possible reason for refusal to eat horse meat as an everyday food, but did not necessarily preclude ritual slaughter and consumption. Roman sources state that the goddess Epona was widely worshipped in Gaul and southern Britain. Epona, a triple-aspect goddess, was the protectress of the horse and horse keepers, and horses were sacrificed to her; she was paralleled by the Irish Macha and Welsh Rhiannon. In \"The White Goddess\", Robert Graves argued that the taboo among Britons and their descendants was due to worship of Epona, and even earlier rites. The Uffington White Horse is probable evidence of ancient horse worship. The ancient Indian Kshatriyas engaged in horse sacrifice (Ashwamedh Yaghya) as recorded in the Vedas and Ramayana; but within context of the ritual sacrificial is not being 'killed' but instead being smothered to death. In 1913, the Finnic Mari people of the Volga region were observed to practice a horse sacrifice.\n\nIn ancient Scandinavia, the horse was very important, as a living, working creature, as a sign of the owner's status, and symbolically within the old Norse religion. Horses were slaughtered as a sacrifice to the gods, and the meat was eaten by the people taking part in the religious feasts. When the Nordic countries were Christianized, eating horse meat was regarded as a sign of paganism and prohibited. A reluctance to eat horse meat is still common in these countries even today.\n\nIn most countries where horses are slaughtered for food, they are processed in a similar fashion to cattle, i.e., in large-scale factory slaughter houses (abattoirs) where they are stunned with a captive bolt gun and bled to death. In countries with a less industrialized food production system, horses and other animals are slaughtered individually outdoors as needed, in the village where they will be consumed, or near to it.\n\nIn 2005, the eight principal horse meat-producing countries produced over 700,000 tonnes of this product.\n\nIn 2005, the five biggest horse meat-consuming countries were China (421,000 tonnes), Mexico, Russia, Italy, and Kazakhstan (54,000 tonnes). In 2010, Mexico produced 140,000 tonnes, China - 126,000 tonnes, Kazakhstan - 114,000 tonnes.\n\nAs horses are relatively poor converters of grass and grain to meat compared to cattle, they are not usually bred or raised specifically for their meat. Instead, horses are slaughtered when their monetary value as riding or work animals is low, but their owners can still make money selling them for horse meat, for example in the routine export of the southern English ponies from the New Forest, Exmoor, and Dartmoor. British law requires the use of \"equine passports\" even for semi wild horses to enable traceability (also known as \"provenance\"), so most slaughtering is done in the UK before the meat is exported, meaning that the animals travel as carcasses rather than live. Ex-racehorses, riding horses, and other horses sold at auction may also enter the food chain; sometimes these animals have been stolen or purchased under false pretenses. Even prestigious horses may end up in the slaughterhouse; the 1986 Kentucky Derby winner and 1987 Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year winner, Ferdinand, is believed to have been slaughtered in Japan, probably for pet food.\n\nA misconception exists that horses are commonly slaughtered for pet food. In many countries, such as the United States, horse meat was outlawed for use in pet food in the 1970s. American horse meat is considered a delicacy in Europe and Japan, and its cost is in line with veal, so it would be prohibitively expensive in many countries for pet food.\n\nThe British newspaper \"The Daily Mail\" reports that every year, 100,000 live horses are transported into and around the European Union for human consumption, mainly to Italy, but also to France and Belgium.\n\nMeat from horses that veterinarians have put down with a lethal injection is not suitable for human consumption, as the toxin remains in the meat; the carcasses of such animals are sometimes cremated (most other means of disposal are problematic, due to the toxin). Remains of euthanized animals can be rendered, which maintains the value of the skin, bones, fats, etc., for such purposes as fish food. This is commonly done for lab specimens (e.g., pigs) euthanized by injection. The amount of drug (e.g. a barbiturate) is insignificant after rendering.\n\nCarcasses of horses treated with some drugs are considered edible in some jurisdictions. For example, according to Canadian regulation, hyaluron, used in treatment of particular disorders in horses, in HY-50 preparation, should not be administered to animals to be slaughtered for horse meat. In Europe, however, the same preparation is not considered to have any such effect, and edibility of the horse meat is not affected.\n\nThe killing of horses for human consumption is widely opposed in countries such as the U.S., UK and Australia. where horses are generally considered to be companion and sporting animals only. Almost all equine medications and treatments are labeled as being not intended for human consumption. In the European Union, horses intended for slaughter cannot be treated with many medications commonly used for U.S. horses. For horses going to slaughter, no period of withdrawal, the time between administration of the drug and the time they are butchered, is required. French actress and animal rights activist Brigitte Bardot has spent years crusading against the eating of horse meat. However, the opposition is far from unanimous; a 2007 readers' poll in the London magazine \"Time Out\" showed that 82% of respondents supported chef Gordon Ramsay's decision to serve horse meat in his restaurants.\n\nHorse meat has a slightly sweet taste reminiscent of a combination of beef and venison. Meat from younger horses tends to be lighter in color, while older horses produce richer color and flavor, as with most mammals. Horse meat can be used to replace beef, pork, mutton, venison, and any other meat in virtually any recipe. Horse meat is usually very lean. Jurisdictions which allow for the slaughter of horses for food rarely have age restrictions, so many are quite old, some even as young as 16 to 24 months old. IHDH did find that horses at the age of 6 months had lower value of moisture, and protein. Horses who are killed have around 40 hour long journey to the slaughter house becoming deprived of starvation, thirst, and hypothermia. Causing the horses to be weak and unable to stand, walking out of the trailer.\"\n\nIn 2009, a British agriculture industry website reported these horse meat production levels in various countries:\n\nAustralians do not generally eat horse meat, although they have a horse slaughter industry that exports to Japan, Europe, and Russia. Horse meat exports peaked at 9,327 tons 1986, declining to 3,000 tons in 2003. They are at Peterborough in South Australia (SAMEX Peterborough Pty Ltd) and Caboolture Abattoir in Queensland (Meramist Pty Ltd). A British agriculture industry website reported that Australian horse meat production levels had risen to 24,000 tons by 2009.\n\nOn 30 June 2010, Western Australian Agriculture Minister Terry Redman granted final approval to Western Australia butcher Vince Garreffa to sell horse meat for human consumption. Nedlands restaurateur Pierre Ichallalene announced plans to do a taster on Bastille Day and to put horse meat dishes on the menu if the reaction is good. Mr. Redman said that the government would \"consider extending approvals should the public appetite for horse demand it\".\n\nMr. Garreffa is the owner of Mondo Di Carne, a major wholesale meat supplier which supplies many cafes, restaurants, and hotels in Western Australia. He commented that no domestic market exists for horse meat, but a successful export market exists, of which he believes Western Australia should have a share.\n\nThis decision caused outrage amongst some groups, limited reaction from many, and enthusiasm from others. Several local newspaper forums indicated that the general public were not greatly biased either way, in fact many voiced their openness for alternative meats.\n\nHorse meat consumption has continued as a niche market in Australia, with further potential for growth as gourmet interests develop.\n\nAlthough it is generally acceptable to Chinese people, outside of specific areas such as Guilin in Guangxi or in Yunnan Province, horse meat is not popular due to its low availability and rumors that horse meat tastes bad or it is bad for health. Because \"the Compendium of Materia Medica\" written during the Ming dynasty by Li Shizhen indicates that horse meat is poisonous and may cause folliculitis or death. \"The Compendium of Materia Medica\" also asserts, \"To relieve toxin caused by eating horse meat, one can drink Phragmites root jouce and eat apricot kernel.\" Today, in southern China, locally famous dishes include horse meat rice noodles (; Pinyin: \"mǎròu mǐfěn\") in Guilin and horse meat hot pot (; Pinyin: \"mǎròu huǒguō\") in Huishui County in Guizhou Province.\n\nIn Indonesia, one type of satay (chunks of skewered grilled meat served with spicy sauce) known as horse satay (Javanese:\"sate jaran\", Indonesian:\"sate kuda\") is made from horse meat. This delicacy from Yogyakarta is served with sliced fresh shallot, pepper, and sweet soy sauce.\n\nIn Japanese cuisine, raw horse meat is called or because of its pink color. It can be served raw as \"sashimi\" in thin slices dipped in soy sauce, often with ginger and onions added. In this case, it is called . \"Basashi\" is popular in some regions of Japan and is often served at \"izakaya\" bars. Fat, typically from the neck, is also found as \"basashi\", though it is white, not pink. Horse meat is also sometimes found on menus for \"yakiniku\" (a type of barbecue), where it is called or ; thin slices of raw horse meat are sometimes served wrapped in a shiso leaf. Kumamoto, Nagano, and Ōita are famous for \"basashi\", and it is common in the Tōhoku region, as well. Some types of canned \"corned meat\" in Japan include horse as one of the ingredients.\n\nAside raising local draft horses for meat, Japan imports living horses (from Canada) and meat from several countries - five largest are Canada, Mexico, Italy, Argentina and Brazil.\n\nIn Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, horse meat is a large part of the diet, due mainly to the nomadic roots of the population. Some of the dishes include sausages called \"kazy\" and \"chuchuk\" or \"shuzhyk\" made from the meat using the guts as the sausage skin, \"zhaya\" made from hip meat which is smoked and boiled, \"jal (or zhal)\" made from neck fat which is smoked and boiled, \"karta\" made from a section of the rectum which is smoked and boiled, and \"sur-et\" which is kept as dried meat.\n\n Salted horse meat sausages called \"kazy\" are produced as a regional delicacy by the Kazakhs. Generally, Mongols prefer beef and mutton (though during the extremely cold Mongolian winter, some people prefer horse meat due to its low cholesterol). It is kept unfrozen, and traditionally people think horse meat helps warm them up.\n\nOther Asian nations import processed horse meat from Mongolia.\n\nIn the Philippines, horse meat (\"lukba\", \"tapang kabayo\", or \"kabayo\") is a delicacy commonly sold in wet markets. The method of preparation is very common which includes marinating the meat in \"calamansi\" or lemon juice, \"toyo\" (soy sauce), and \"patís\" (fish sauce). It is then fried and served, and often dipped into vinegar to give the meat a tart flavour.\n\nIn South Korea, horse meat is generally not eaten, but raw horse meat, usually around the neck part, is consumed as a delicacy on Jeju Island. It is usually seasoned with soy sauce and sesame oil.\n\nIn Tonga, horsemeat or \"lo'i ho'osi\" is much more than just a delicacy; the consumption of horsemeat is generally only reserved for special occasions. These special occasions may include the death of an important family member or community member or as a form of celebration during the birthday of an important family member or perhaps the visitation of someone important, such as the King of Tonga.\n\nIn Tonga, a horse is one of the most valuable animals a family can own because of its use as a beast of burden. Tonga has long lacked land area compared with its population so the missionaries introduced horsemeat in lieu of cattle. Therefore, the slaughter of one's horse for consumption becomes a moment of immense homage to the person or event for which the horse was slain. Despite a diaspora into Western countries such as Australia, the USA, and New Zealand, where consumption of horsemeat is generally taboo, Tongans still practice the consumption of horse meat perhaps even more so because it is more readily available and more affordable.\n\nIn 2013, horse meat and traces of horse DNA were found in some food products where horse was not labelled as an ingredient, sparking the 2013 meat adulteration scandal across Europe.\n\nHorse \"Leberkäse\" is available in special horse butcheries and occasionally at various stands, sold in a bread roll. Dumplings can also be prepared with horse meat, spinach, or Tyrolean \"Graukäse\" (a sour milk cheese). They are occasionally eaten on their own, in a soup, or as a side dish.\n\nIn Belgium, horse meat (\"paardenvlees\" in Dutch and \"viande chevaline\" in French) is popular in a number of preparations. Lean, smoked, and sliced horse meat fillet (\"paardenrookvlees\" or \"paardengerookt\"; \"filet chevalin\" in French) is served as a cold cut with sandwiches or as part of a cold salad. Horse steaks can be found in most butchers and are used in a variety of preparations. The city of Vilvoorde has a few restaurants specialising in dishes prepared with horse meat. Horse sausage is a well-known local specialty in Lokeren with European recognition. Smoked or dried horse/pork meat sausage, similar to salami, is sold in a square shape to be distinguished from pork and/or beef sausages. A Flemish region around the Rupel river is also famous for a horse stew named 'Schep', made out of shoulder chuck (or similar cuts), brown ale, onions and mustard. Schep is typically served with fries, mayonnaise and a salad of raw Belgian endive.\n\nHorse meat is served in some restaurants in Bulgaria, as the preferred way of consuming it is in the form of steaks and burgers. Still being far from a meat for mass consumption, horse beef is re-gaining its popularity, which it had in the 60s and 70s of the past century, when it was also consumed in sausages and tartares.\n\nIn France, specialized butcher shops (\"boucheries chevalines\") sell horse meat, as ordinary butcher shops were for a long time forbidden to deal in it. However, since the 1990s, it can be found in supermarket butcher shops and others.\n\nHorse meat was famously eaten in large amounts during the 1870 Siege of Paris, when it was included in \"haute cuisine\" menus.\n\nAlthough there is no taboo comparable to that in the English-speaking world, German law used to prescribe that horse meat be sold only by specialized butchers (\"Pferdemetzgereien\"). This prescription was abolished in 1993, but only a small minority of ordinary butchers have since begun to sell horse meat. Most horse meat is still sold by the specialists, some of whom also deliver by mail order.\n\nMany regions of Germany have traditional recipes that include horse meat. In the Rhineland around Cologne and Düsseldorf, restaurants often offer the traditional \"Sauerbraten\" in horse meat, typically with a beef variant to choose from. Other traditional horse meat dishes include the Swabian \"Pferderostbraten\" (a joint of roast meat prepared similarly to roast beef), Bavarian sausage varieties such as \"Rosswurst\" and \"Ross-Kochsalami\" as well as \"Ross-Leberkäse\", a meatloaf dish.\n\nThe 2013 meat adulteration scandal started when German authorities detected horse meat in prepared food products including frozen lasagna, where it was declared fraudulently as beef. The mislabeling prompted EU authorities to speed up publication of European Commission recommendations for labeling the origin of all processed meat.\n\nIn Hungary, horse meat is primarily used in salami and sausages, usually mixed with pork, but also in goulashes and other stews. These products are sold in most supermarkets and many butcher shops.\n\nIn Iceland, it is both eaten minced and as steak, also used in stews and fondue, prized for its strong flavor. It has a particular role in the culture and history of the island. The people of Iceland supposedly were reluctant to embrace Christianity for some time largely over the issue of giving up horse meat after Pope Gregory III banned horse meat consumption in 732 AD, as it was a major part of many pagan rites and sacrifice in Northern Europe. Horse meat consumption was banned when the pagan Norse Icelanders eventually adopted Christianity in the year 1000. The ban became so ingrained that most people would not handle horse meat let alone consume it. Even during harsh famines in the 18th century most people would not eat horse meat, and those who did were castigated. In 1757 the ban was decriminalised, but general distaste for horse meat lasted well into the 19th century, possibly longer, and its consumption often regarded as an indication of poverty. Even today horse meat is not popular (3.2% of Iceland’s meat production in 2015), although this has more to do with culinary tradition and the popularity of equestrianism than any religious vestiges.\n\nHorse meat is especially popular in Lombardia, Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol, Parma, Apulia, and the islands of Sardinia and Sicily.\n\nHorse meat is used in a variety of recipes: as a stew called \"pastissada\" (typical of Verona), served as steaks, as \"carpaccio\", or made into \"bresaola\". Thin strips of horse meat called \"sfilacci\" are popular. Horse fat is used in recipes such as \"\". Horse meat sausages and salamis are traditional in various places. In Sardinia, \"sa petza 'e cuaddu\" or \"sa petha (d)e caddu\" (\"campidanese\" and \"logudorese\" for horse meat) is one of the most renowned meats and sometimes is sold in typical kiosks with bread - also in the town of Sassari is a long tradition of eating horse steaks (\"carri di cabaddu\" in the local dialect). Chefs and consumers tend to prize its uniqueness by serving it as rare as possible. Donkey is also cooked, for example as a stew called \"stracotto d'asino\" and as meat for sausages e.g. \"mortadella d'asino\". The cuisine of Parma features a horsemeat \"tartare\" called \"pesto di cavallo\", as well as various cooked dishes.\n\nIn Veneto, the consumption of horse meat dates back to at least 1000 BC to the Adriatic Veneti, renowned for their horse-breeding skills. They were used to sacrifice horses to their goddess Reitia or to the mythical hero Diomedes. Throughout the classical period, Veneto established itself as a centre for horse breeding in Italy; Venetian horses were provided for the cavalry and carriage of the Roman legions, with the white Venetic horses becoming famous among Greeks and Romans as one of the best breeds for circus racing. As well as breeding horses for military and farming applications, the Venetics also used them for consumption throughout the Roman period, a practice that established the consumption of horse meat as a tradition in Venetian cuisine. In the modern age, horse meat is considered a luxury item and is widely available through supermarkets and butcheries, with some specialised butcheries offering only selected cuts of equine meat. Prices are usually higher than beef, pork, or any other kind of meat, except game.\n\nIn the Province of Padua, horse meat is a key element of the local cuisine, particularly in the area that extends southeast from the city, historically called Saccisica. Specialties based on horse meat constitute the main courses and best attractions of several typical restaurants in the zone. They are also served among other regional delicacies at the food stands of many local festivals, related to civil and religious anniversaries. Most notable is the \"Festa del Cavallo\", held annually in the small town of Legnaro and totally dedicated to horses, included their consumption for food.\n\nSome traditional dishes are:\n\nIn southern Italy, horse meat is commonly eaten everywhere - especially in the region of Apulia, where it is considered a delicacy. It is often a vital part of the \"ragù barese\" () in Bari.\n\nAccording to British food writer Matthew Fort, \"The taste for donkey and horse goes back to the days when these animals were part of everyday agricultural life. In the frugal, unsentimental manner of agricultural communities, all the animals were looked on as a source of protein. Waste was not an option.\"\n\nIn Malta, horse meat () is seared and slowly cooked for hours in either tomato or red wine sauce. A few horse meat shops still exist and it is still served in some restaurants.\n\nIn the Netherlands, smoked horse meat (\"paardenrookvlees\") is sold as sliced meat and eaten on bread. \"Zuurvlees\", a southern Dutch stew, is made with horse meat as main ingredient. There are also beef-based variants. Horse meat is also used in sausages (\"paardenworst\" and \"frikandel\"), fried fast food snacks and ready-to-eat soups.\n\nIn Norway, horse meat is commonly used in cured meats, such as \"vossakorv\" and \"svartpølse\", and less commonly as steak, \"hestebiff\".\n\nIn pre-Christian Norway, horse was seen as an expensive animal. To eat a horse was to show one had great wealth, and to sacrifice a horse to the gods was seen as the greatest gift one could give. When Norwegians adopted Christianity, horse-eating became taboo as it was a religious act for pagans, thus it was considered a sign of heresy.\n\nLive, old horses are often exported to Italy to be slaughtered. This practice also garners controversy. Horses in Poland are treated mostly as companions and the majority of society is against the live export to Italy. However, in Poland there exists a tradition of eating horse meat (sausage or tartare steaks). The consumption of horse meat was the biggest in the times when other meat was scarce (in the 20th century: WWII and the communist period).\n\nHorse meat is generally available in Serbia, though mostly shunned in traditional cuisine. It is, however, often recommended by general practitioners to persons who suffer from anemia. It is available to buy at three green markets in Belgrade, a market in Niš, and in several cities in ethnically mixed Vojvodina, where Hungarian and previously German traditions brought the usage.\n\nHorse meat is generally available in Slovenia, and is highly popular in the traditional cuisine, especially in the central region of Carniola and in the Karst region. Colt steak (\"žrebičkov zrezek\") is also highly popular, especially in Slovenia's capital Ljubljana, where it is part of the city's traditional regional cuisine. In Ljubljana, many restaurants sell burgers and meat that contain large amounts of horse meat, including a fast-food chain called Hot' Horse.\n\n\"Cecina\" is cured meat made from beef or horse, and it is considered as a delicacy. Foal meat (\"carne de potro\") is preferred rather than horse meat, and it is easy to find in supermarkets and usually prepared as stew or steak. It is a common practice to give it to children with anemia. Although no generalized taboo exists in Spain, its consumption is minor compared to pork, beef, and lamb.\n\nSmoked/cured horse meat is widely available as a cold cut under the name \"hamburgerkött\" (literally \"hamburgermeat\"). It tends to be very thinly sliced and fairly salty, slightly reminiscent of deli-style ham and, as a packaged meat, may list horsemeat (as \"hästkött\") as its primary ingredient. Several varieties of smoked sausages made from horse meat including \"Gustafskorv\" are also quite popular, especially in the province of Dalarna, where it is made. It is similar to salami or \"metworst\" and is used as an alternative to them on sandwiches. It is also possible to order horse beef from some well-stocked grocery stores.\n\nThe ordinance on foodstuffs of animal origin in Switzerland explicitly lists equines as an animal species allowed for the production of food. Horse steak is modestly common. A speciality known as \"Mostbröckli\" is made with beef or horse meat. It is also used for a range of sausages in the German-speaking north of Switzerland. Like in northern Italy, in the Italian-speaking south, local \"salametti\" (sausages) are sometimes made with horse meat. It may also be used in \"fondue Bourguignonne\".\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the slaughter, preparation, and consumption of horses for food is not against the law, although it has been rare since the 1930s and it is not generally available. There is a cultural taboo against consuming horse meat in the UK, although it was eaten when other meats were scarce, such as during times of war (as was whale meat, which was never popular in Britain). The sale of meat labelled as horse meat in supermarkets and butchers is minimal, and most of the properly described horse meat consumed in the UK is imported from Europe, predominantly the south of France, where it is more widely available.\n\nHorse meat may be eaten without the knowledge of the consumer, due to accidental or fraudulent introduction of horse meat into human food. A 2003 Food Standards Agency (FSA) investigation revealed that certain sausages, salami and similar products such as chorizo and pastrami sometimes contain horse meat without it being listed, although listing is legally required. The 2013 horse meat scandal involved multiple products being recalled from shelves due to unlabelled horse meat in amounts up to 100% of the meat content. The issue came to light on 15 January 2013, when it was reported that horse DNA had been discovered in frozen beefburgers sold in several Irish and British supermarkets.\n\nHorse meat was featured in a segment in a 2007 episode of the Gordon Ramsay series \"The F Word\". In the segment, Janet Street-Porter convinced locals to try horse meat, though not before facing controversy and being forced to move her stand to a privately owned location. The meat was presented as having a similar taste to beef, but with less fat, a high concentration of omega-3 fatty acid and a safer alternative in times of worry regarding bird flu and mad cow disease. The segment was met with skepticism from many after broadcast for various reasons, either because some felt the practice was cruel and against social norms, or simply a belief that if the taste was really on par with other meats, then people would already be eating it.\n\nIn Ukraine, especially in Crimea and other southern steppe regions, horse meat is consumed in the form of sausages called \"mahan\" and \"sudzhuk\". These particular sausages are traditional food of the Crimean Tatar population.\n\nA thriving horse meat business exists in Quebec; the meat is available in most supermarket chains there. Horse meat is also for sale at the other end of the country, in Granville Island Market in downtown Vancouver, where according to a \"Time\" magazine reviewer who smuggled it into the United States, it turned out to be a \"sweet, rich, superlean, oddly soft meat, closer to beef than venison\". Horse meat is also available in high-end Toronto butchers and supermarkets. Aside from the heritage of French cuisine at one end of the country, most of Canada shares the horse meat taboo with the rest of the English-speaking world. This mentality is especially evident in Alberta, where strong horse racing and breeding industries and cultures have existed since the province's founding, although large numbers of horses are slaughtered for meat in Fort MacLeod, and certain butchers in Calgary do sell it.\n\nThe consumer protection show \"Kassensturz\" of Swiss television SRF together with Tier Schutz Bund, Zürich, reported on 19 February 2013 the bad treatment and brutal animal husbandry in Canadian horse meat farms in Fort MacLeod, Alberta, consequently the import from such farms has been boycotted.\n\nCBC News reported on March 10, 2013, that horse meat was also popular among some segments of Toronto's population. \n\nHorse meat is generally not eaten in the United States and holds a taboo in American culture which is very similar to the one found in the United Kingdom. All horse meat produced in the United States (up until the last quarter of 2007) was intended solely for export abroad, primarily to the European Union. A thriving horse exportation business is going on in several states, including Texas, mainly exporting horses to slaughterhouses in either Canada or Mexico.\n\nRestriction of human consumption of horse meat in the U.S. has generally involved legislation at local, state, and federal levels. Several states enacted legislation either prohibiting the sale of horse meat or banning altogether the slaughter of horses. \nCalifornia Proposition 6 (1998) was passed by state voters, outlawing the possession, transfer, reception, or holding any horse, pony, burro, or mule by a person who is aware that it will be used for human consumption, and making the slaughter of horses or the sale of horsemeat for human consumption a misdemeanor offense.\n\nIn 2007, the Illinois General Assembly enacted Public Act 95-02, ameding Chapter 225, Section 635 of the state's compiled statutes to prohibit both the act of slaughtering equines for human consumption as well as the trade of any horse meat similarly to Texas Agriculture Code's Chapter 149.\n\nOther states banning horse slaughter or the sale of horse meat include New Jersey, Oklahoma, and Mississippi. In addition, several other states introduced legislation to outlaw the practice over the years, such as Florida, Massachusetts, New Mexico, and New York.\n\nAt the federal level, since 2001 several bills have been regularly introduced in both the House and Senate to ban horse slaughter throughout the country without success. However, a budgetary provision banning the use of federal funds to carry out mandatory inspections at horse slaughter plants (necessary to allow interstate sale and exports of horse meat) has also been in place since 2007. This restriction was temporarily removed in 2011 as part of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2012 but was again included in the FY2014 Agriculture Appropriations Act and subsequent federal budgets, hence preventing the operation of any domestic horse slaughter operation.\n\nUntil 2007, only three horse meat slaughterhouses still existed in the United States for export to foreign markets, but they were closed by court orders resulting from the upholding of aforementioned Illinois and Texas statutes banning horse slaughter and the sale of horse meat.\n\nThe taboo surrounding horse meat in the United States received national attention again in May 2017 when a restaurant in the Lawrenceville section of Pittsburgh served a dish containing horse tartare as part of a special event the restaurant was hosting with French Canadian chefs as guests. The restaurant, which otherwise does not serve horse meat (which is legal to serve and consume in Pennsylvania), received an inspection and a warning from the USDA not to serve horse meat again. A Change.org petition subsequently went up to advocate making serving horse meat illegal in Pennsylvania.\n\nFrom the 1920s and through the 1950s or 1960s, and with a brief rationing hiccup during WWII, horse meat was canned and sold as dog food by many different companies under many different brands, most notably by Ken-L Ration. The popularity of horse meat as dog food became so popular that by the 1930s over 50,000 horses were bred and slaughtered each year to keep up with this specific demand.\n\nAs of 2005, Mexico was the second largest producer of horse meat in the world. By 2009, it became the largest producer of horse meat in the world. It is only exported as it is not used or consumed in Mexico.\n\nIn Chile, it is used in \"charqui\". Also in Chile, horse meat became the main source of nutrition for the nomadic indigenous tribes, which promptly switched from a guanaco-based economy to a horse-based one after the horses brought by the Spaniards bred naturally and became feral. This applied specially to the Pampa and Mapuche nations, who became fierce horseman warriors. Similar to the Tatars, they ate raw horse meat and milked their animals.\n\nAlthough not nearly as common as beef meat, horse meat can be readily available in some butcheries throughout the country. It is generally less expensive than beef and somewhat associated with lower social strata.\n\nArgentina is a producer and exporter of horse meat, but it is not used in local consumption and is considered taboo.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "985959", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=985959", "title": "Lifelong learning", "text": "Lifelong learning\n\nLifelong learning is the \"ongoing, voluntary, and self-motivated\" pursuit of knowledge for either personal or professional reasons. Therefore, it not only enhances social inclusion, active citizenship, and personal development, but also self-sustainability, as well as competitiveness and employability.\n\nEvolved from the term \"life-long learners\", created by Leslie Watkins and used by Professor Clint Taylor (CSULA) and Superintendent for the Temple City Unified School District's mission statement in 1993, the term recognizes that learning is not confined to childhood or the classroom but takes place throughout life and in a range of situations. Allen Tough (1979), Canadian educator and researcher, asserts that almost 70% of learning projects are self-planned.\n\nDuring the last fifty years, constant scientific and technological innovation and change has had profound effects on how learning is understood. Learning can no longer be divided into a place and time to acquire knowledge (school) and a place and time to apply the knowledge acquired (the workplace). Instead, learning can be seen as something that takes place on an ongoing basis from our daily interactions with others and with the world around us. It can create and shapeshift into the form of formal learning or informal learning, or self-directed learning.\n\nTwo theories of particular relevance when considering lifelong learning are cognitivism and constructivism. Cognitivism, most notably Gestalt theory, speaks of learning as making sense of the relationship between what is old and what is new. Similarly, Constructivist theory states that \"knowledge is not passively received from the world or from authoritative sources but constructed by individuals or groups making sense of their experiential worlds\". Constructivism lends itself well to Lifelong learning as it brings together learning from many different sources including life experiences.\n\nLifelong learning is being recognized by traditional colleges and universities as valid in addition to degree attainment. Some learning is accomplished in segments or interest categories and can still be valuable to the individual and community. The economic impact of educational institutions at all levels will remain significant as individuals continue formal studies and pursue interest-based subjects. Institutions produce educated citizens who buy goods and services in the community and the education facilities and personnel generate economic activity during the operations and institutional activities. Similar to health facilities, educational institutions are among the top employers in many cities and towns of the world. Whether brick-and-mortar or distance education institutions, there is a great economic impact worldwide from learning, including lifelong learning, for all age groups. The lifelong learners, including persons with academic or professional credentials, tend to find higher-paying occupations, leaving monetary, cultural, and entrepreneurial impressions on communities, according to educator Cassandra B. Whyte.\n\nAlthough the term is widely used in a variety of contexts, its meaning is often unclear. A learning approach that can be used to define lifelong learning is heutagogy.\n\nThere are several established contexts for lifelong learning beyond traditional \"brick and mortar\" schooling:\nE-learning is available at most colleges and universities or to individuals learning independently. There are even online courses being offered for free by many institutions.\n\nOne new (2008 and beyond) expression of lifelong learning is the massive open online course (a MOOC), in which a teacher or team offers a syllabus and some direction for the participation of hundreds, sometimes thousands, of learners. Most MOOCs do not offer typical \"credit\" for courses taken, which is why they are interesting and useful examples of lifelong learning.\n\nLifelong learning is defined as \"all learning activity undertaken throughout life, with the aim of improving knowledge, skills and competences within a personal, civic, social and/or employment-related perspective\". It is often considered learning that occurs after the formal education years of childhood (where learning is instructor-driven—pedagogical) and into adulthood (where the learning is individually-driven—andragogical). It is sought out naturally through life experiences as the learner seeks to gain knowledge for professional or personal reasons.'Knowledge results from the combination of grasping experience and transforming it' (Kolb 1984: 41). \nThe concept of lifelong learning has become of vital importance with the emergence of new technologies that change how we receive and gather information, collaborate with others, and communicate.\n\nAs technology rapidly changes, individuals must adapt and learn to meet everyday demands. However, throughout life, an individual's functional capacities may also change. Assistive technologies are also important considerations under the umbrella of emerging technology and lifelong learning. Access to informal and formal learning opportunities for individuals with disabilities may be dependent upon low and high tech assistive technology.\n\nThe emergence of Web 2.0 technologies has great potential to support lifelong learning endeavors, allowing for informal, just-in-time, day-to-day learning. Constant change is emerging as the new normal. To thrive, organizations and individuals must be able to adjust, and enhance their knowledge and skills to meet evolving needs. This means the most important thing someone can learn is how to learn. An understanding of web 2.0 tools is critical to keeping up with a changing world and the information explosion.\n\nProfessions typically recognize the importance of developing practitioners becoming lifelong learners. Nowadays, formal training is only a beginning. Knowledge accumulates at such a fast rate that one must continue to learn to be effective (Williams, 2001). Many licensed professions mandate that their members continue learning to maintain a license. (Merriam, Caffarella, & Baumgartner, 2007). Having said this, what are the characteristics or skills that a lifelong learner must develop. Reflective learning and critical thinking can help a learner to become more self-reliant through learning how to learn, thus making them better able to direct, manage, and control their own learning process (Candy, 1990). Sipe (1995) studied experimentally \"open\" teachers and found that they valued self-directed learning, collaboration, reflection, and challenge; risk taking in their learning was seen as an opportunity, not a threat. Dunlap and Grabinger (2003) say that for higher education students to be lifelong learners, they must develop a capacity for self-direction, metacognition awareness, and a disposition toward learning (Merriam, Caffarella, & Baumgartner, 2007).\n\nWhile the study of metacognition originally gave educational psychologists insights into what differentiated successful students from their less successful peers, it is increasingly being used to inform teaching that aims to make students more aware of their learning processes, and show them how to regulate those processes for more effective learning throughout their lives.\n\nEducators can employ Cognitive Strategy Instruction (CSI) as a means to help learners develop their metacognition. Again, learners who are better equipped to create learning strategies for themselves will have more success in achieving their cognitive goals.\n\nAs lifelong learning is \"lifelong, lifewide, voluntary, and self-motivated\" learning to learn, that is, learning how to recognize learning strategies, and monitor and evaluate learning, is a pre-condition for lifelong learning. Metacognition is an essential first step in developing lifelong learning.\n\nThe Delors Report proposed an integrated vision of education based on two key paradigms: lifelong learning and the four pillars of learning. The report proposed a holistic conceptual framework of learning, that of the 'four pillars of learning'. It argued that formal education tends to emphasize the acquisition of knowledge to the detriment of other types of learning essential to sustaining human development. It stressed the need to think of learning over the life course, and to address how everyone can develop relevant skills, knowledge and attitudes for work, citizenship and personal fulfillment. The four pillars of learning are:\nIt is important to note that the four pillars of learning were envisaged against the backdrop of the notion of 'lifelong learning', itself an adaptation of the concept of 'lifelong education' as initially conceptualized in the 1972 Faure publication \"Learning to Be\".\n\nIn India and elsewhere, the \"University of the Third Age\" (U3A) provides an example of the almost spontaneous emergence of autonomous learning groups accessing the expertise of their own members in the pursuit of knowledge and shared experience. No prior qualifications and no subsequent certificates feature in this approach to learning for its own sake and, as participants testify, engagement in this type of learning in later life can indeed 'prolong active life'.\n\nIn Sweden the successful concept of study circles, an idea launched almost a century ago, still represents a large portion of the adult education provision. The concept has since spread, and for instance, is a common practice in Finland as well. A study circle is one of the most democratic forms of a learning environment that has been created. There are no teachers and the group decides on what content will be covered, scope will be used, as well as a delivery method.\n\nSometimes lifelong learning aims to provide educational opportunities outside standard educational systems—which can be cost-prohibitive, if available at all. On the other hand, formal administrative units devoted to this discipline exist in a number of universities. For example, the 'Academy of Lifelong Learning' is an administrative unit within the University-wide 'Professional and Continuing Studies' unit at the University of Delaware. Another example is the Jagiellonian University Extension (Wszechnica Uniwersytetu Jagiellonskiego), which is one of the most comprehensive Polish centers for lifelong learning (open learning, organizational learning, community learning).\n\nIn recent years, 'lifelong learning' has been adopted in the UK as an umbrella term for post-compulsory education that falls outside of the UK higher education system – further education, community education, work-based learning and similar voluntary, public sector and commercial settings.\n\nMost colleges and universities in the United States encourage lifelong learning to non-traditional students. Professional licensure and certification courses are also offered at many universities, for instance for teachers, social services providers, and other professionals. Some colleges even enable adults to earn credit for the college-level learning gained through work, volunteer and other experiences.\n\nBangladesh Open University (BOU) has six schools and is offering 23 formal and 19 nonformal programs. The number of enrolled students in formal programs for 2016 was 433,413. Most of the courses of BOU are for professional development and most of the students are professional people who are getting scope to study in flexible hours. BOU is the only public institution in the country that imparts education in distance mode. In place of campus based teaching, this university uses technology including electronic devices to reach people in different corners of the country.\n\nIn Canada, the federal government's Lifelong Learning Plan allows Canadian residents to withdraw funds from their Registered Retirement Savings Plan to help pay for lifelong learning, but the funds can only be used for formal learning programs at designated educational institutions.\n\nPriorities for lifelong and life-wide learning have different priorities in different countries, some placing more emphasis on economic development (towards a learning economy) and some on social development (towards a learning society). For example, the policies of China, Republic of Korea, Singapore and Malaysia promote lifelong learning in a human resource development (HRD) perspective. The governments of these countries have done much to foster HRD whilst encouraging entrepreneurship.\n\nMainstream economic analysis has highlighted increased levels of primary and secondary education as a key driver of long-term economic growth. Data show that initial levels of educational attainment explain about half the difference in growth rates between East Asia and sub- Saharan Africa between 1965 and 2010. At the individual level, the knowledge and skills workers acquire through education and training make them more productive. Provision of good quality education can improve the knowledge and skills of a whole population beyond what traditional or informal systems can achieve. For business, educated and highly skilled workers foster productivity gains and technological change, through either innovation or imitation of processes developed elsewhere. At the societal level, education expansion helps build social and institutional capital, which has a strong impact on the investment climate and growth; it also helps in building social trust, developing participatory societies, strengthening the rule of law and supporting good governance.\n\nAccording to the Alzheimer's Society, it is estimated that more than a million Canadians will suffer from Alzheimer's diseases by 2030. \"Exercising the brain may preserve it, forestalling mental decline\" (Grady, 2012).\nIn North America—and presumably globally—to proactively curb potential economic issues as the baby boomers continue to age, we need to look at society through a lifelong learning lens. Consider community programs to engage retirees and foster their cognitive health. Taking a proactive approach to keep our elderly population engaged through learning and their brains exercised as Grady described, the strain on the health care system and not to mention the families of the elderly would be lessened. The US Department of Health and Human Service published a study that suggests that older people with a mild cognitive impairment receive 8.5 hours more of care each week from their family and those with a severe impairment received 41.5 more hours than those without a cognitive impairment (USDHHS, 2007). Who pays for this?\nAs a society we are living longer—85 years for men and 90 years for women—making cognitive health vitally important.\n\n\n"}

It is similar to the feast of Las Posadas in Mexico. Today, the novena is often a social event where families and friends pray, eat, and sing villancicos (Christmas carols) together.\n\nThe novena was created by Fray Frnando Larrea Jesus, born in Quito, Ecuador in 1700, who after his ordination in 1725 was a preacher in Ecuador and Colombia. Fray Fernando wrote it at the request of the founder of the School of Teaching in Bogotá, Mrs. Clemencia Caycedo Jesus Velez.\n\nMany years later, a nun in the 1800s from the same Catholic school, Sister María Ignacia, modified the Novena de Aguinaldos. She added “Los Gozos,” which is best described as a couplet of the aspirations for the coming of the Christ Child. “Loz Gozos” are the verses that all participants pray at the end of the daily and the specific day prayers. To many, this is the best part of the Novena where everyone sings and plays their instruments (even homemade ones). Many times people participate with guitars, piano, harp, or any other instrument. The Novena was created with the purpose of praising the Lord and celebrating the birth of Jesus. In many towns and neighborhoods, priests call upon their communities to gather at church to pray the Novena which includes participants dressed up as Joseph, Mary, Baby Jesus and the animals that are included in the nativity.\n\nThe novena of Aguinaldo is prayed for nine days from December 16 to December 24 to honor the Virgin Mary, St. Joseph, the Wise Men, and baby Jesus. The prayers may be recited individually or together as a group. Often a book with all the novena prayers will be passed around and read. Just as the pilgrims went to a different place each night seeking shelter, a different member of the group may host the novena each night.\n\nThere are prayers for specific nights as well as a set of prayers that are read each night. The set of prayers that are repeated each night are the following:\n\n"}

Some of the moai have been further transferred between museums and private collections, for reasons such as the moais' preservation, academic research and for public education, or - in the instance of the moai from Centro Cultural Recoleta - for repatriation after 80 years overseas.\n\nThe following table lists the most prominent figures held in museums and collections:\n\nThe issue of authenticity of Moai heads may never be fully resolved. The fact is that the rocks used to carve the heads are as old as the volcano eruption that formed them, so carbon 14 testing reveals no evidence of authenticity. The age of the Moai heads on the island cannot be determined, and off the island, heads can only be determined to be made from Easter Island volcanic rock or not made from Easter Island volcanic rock. Determining the age of an Easter Island Moai head is therefore an art, and not a science. Field experts make judgments and express opinions about what tools they feel were used and attempt to tie an age to that\nopinion.\nSuch a condition means that Moai Heads cannot be tested with hope of determining authenticity; they may, however, be brought under suspicion of being fakes. As with any object of antiquity, the patrimony, the history and story of the heads, is an important part in determining authenticity. \nAn unauthenticated moai head entitled \"Henry\" currently stands in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale, California. It was obtained in the first half of the 20th century by the founder of the park Dr. Hubert Eaton. Dr. Eaton received the moai in a legal transaction between Rapanui fishermen at Easter Island who were using the head (approx 1m height) as ballast for a boat. The Memorial Park has no plans for authenticating or testing the moai in the near future.\n\nIn 2003, the Chilean government began an investigation into two moai heads within a set of 15 other Easter Island artefacts — the possessions of Hernan Garcia de Gonzalo Vidal — which were put on sale at The Cronos gallery in Miami. After a photographic inspection by Patricia Vargas, an archaeologist at the University of Chile's Easter Island institute, she commented that \"\"They might be nice art pieces, but I doubt any one is 500 years old. It appears that the cuts have been made with modern machinery and not with stone tools.\" A meeting arranged between the Chilean newspaper El Mercurio which first reported the sale, and Hernan Garcia Gonzalo de Vidal, later failed to take place when Mr Gonzalo de Vidal became unavailable due to a \"family emergency\".\n\nIn 1968, a moai (possibly Moai 35-001) was taken from Rapa Nui and displayed in New York City as a publicity stunt to oppose the building of a jet refueling facility on Easter Island. Around the time of the campaign and the following tour to Washington D.C. and Chicago, the moai was received by the Lippincott company of North Haven, Connecticut, which since its inception in 1966 had provided a \"place for artists to create large sculptures and receive help in transportation and installation of their work\". In co-operation with the International Fund for Monuments Inc, Lippincott produced a copy from the original moai (before it was confiscated by the Chilean government) and claimed the rights to execute the work on 100 further replicas.\n\nIn 1974, Object No. 3 was produced from the copy, and now stands outside the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County.\n"}
{"id": "9964620", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9964620", "title": "Resistance 2", "text": "Resistance 2\n\nResistance 2 is a science fiction first-person shooter video game developed by Insomniac Games and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 3. The game was released in North America on November 4, 2008, in Japan on November 13, 2008, in Australia on November 27, 2008, and in Europe on the following day. \"Resistance 2\" is the sequel to the best-selling PlayStation 3 launch title \"\".\n\n\"Resistance 2\" sees protagonist Nathan Hale travel to the United States in order to once again battle the Chimera, who have launched a full-scale invasion of both the east and west coasts. In this game, Hale is part of an elite force of soldiers called \"The Sentinels\", who, like him, are infected with the Chimeran virus, and must keep it under control through regular application of inhibitors.\n\nThe game, along with \"\" and \"Resistance 3\", had its online servers shut down on April 8, 2014. Digital versions of the first two games were released after the servers' closure, exclusively in Europe.\n\n\"Resistance 2\" is a single-player campaign, with the player controlling protagonist Nathan Hale. The game includes many of the weapons from \"Resistance: Fall of Man\", as well as new weapons such as the \"Marksman\" and a mini gun called the \"HVAP (High Velocity Armor Piercing) Wraith\". The weapons are a mix of 1950s human technology and more advanced alien technology. Unlike the first game, where there was no limit on the number of weapons carried, \"Resistance 2\" limited the player to only two weapons at any given time, as well as a more limited number of grenades. \"Resistance 2\" also does not use a health bar in the single player campaign as it did in the first, but instead it uses an automatic regenerative health system, whereby players must keep out of the line of fire in order to recover health.\n\n\"Resistance 2\" features multiplayer in two variations. Both multiplayer modes track the player's performance, gaining experience and leading to benefits and rewards, as well as assigning the player a skill ranking.\n\n\"Resistance 2\" does not offer co-op for the single player campaign. Cooperative mode features a separate campaign mode set in 1952-53 in the gap in the time line of the single-player campaign. The cooperative campaign supports anything from two to eight players, taking the role of a special forces group called \"Spectre Team\". Players are tasked with many randomized objectives around the map, while defeating hordes of Chimera in the process. The strength of the enemy forces is altered based on the number of players and their skill levels. There are three classes to choose from: Special Ops — long-distance damage dealers, who also provide ammunition; Soldiers — the \"tanks\" who endure the most damage; and Medics — who drain life from enemies and impart to teammates.\n\nCompetitive mode features support for up to 60 players during the Skirmish mode; which allowed for the greatest number of players in an online PlayStation 3 game at the time of release, but was last surpassed by \"MAG\". Five games modes are available: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Core Control (Capture the Flag), Skirmish, and released via update, Meltdown. Skirmish has players getting split up into squads of five and take part in objective-based proxy-battles. Players can play as either the Humans or the Chimerans (but due to updates, the player can now be a Cloven, a Female Ranger, or a Ravager), and get to choose their weapon loadout before and during a game while respawning.\n\nMany weapons make a return from the original, most notably the Carbine, Bullseye, Fareye, Auger, Rossmore and LAARK (although this can be only accessed through a berserk). However, the Arc Charger and Dragon did not return, and were instead replaced with the Bellock, Wraith, Splicer and Pulse Cannon. The addition of berserks is a new feature, and can only be accessed if the player reaches a required XP during a game through kills. The berserks give players an additional advantage such as a new weapon or added health but only for a short period of time.\n\nThere are a variety of campaign based maps featuring maps of different sizes (10p, 20p, 40p, 60p) with the player choosing their preference. Custom games also made a return, although unlike \"Resistance: Fall of Man\", players cannot receive XP in custom games. The ranking system is also identical to that of \"Resistance: Fall of Man\", with players progressing through 20 ranks with three tiers each from private up to supreme commander (making a total of 60 ranks). As some ranks are gained, players receive unlockables such as different berserks and skins.\n\nIn 2014, Sony stated they would shut down the online servers for the Resistance trilogy on March 28. From then on, online multiplayer would be disabled. However, the single player/story mode and offline co-op campaigns are still available to play.\n\nFollowing the events of the first \"Resistance\", soldiers from the Special Research Projects Administration (SRPA), led by Major Richard Blake, take custody of Sgt. Nathan Hale. They transport him to an American black site in Iceland, but are soon shot down by Chimeran forces. In a desperate move, Blake releases \"Daedalus\", a Chimeran leader, ignoring warnings that he cannot be controlled. Daedalus soon escapes and the SRPA are forced to abandon their base. Blake then explains to Hale that he is part of \"Project Abraham\", a covert effort to create human soldiers infused with the Chimera virus, known as Sentinels. Two years later, Hale is promoted to Lieutenant and given command of Echo Squad, consisting of Sergeant Ben Warner, Specialist Aaron Hawthorne, and Corporal Joseph Capelli.\nOn May 15, 1953, a Chimeran armada launches an invasion of the United States, overwhelming most of its remaining populated cities. Among the targets is an underwater SRPA outpost in San Francisco, where Hale is scheduled to undergo inhibitor treatment to prevent the Chimera virus completely taking him over. With Blake providing backup, Hale oversees a full evacuation and retrieves inhibitor samples for the Sentinels. The survivors retreat to the Midwest, where they track a damaged Chimeran flagship to Orick, California. Stealing an enemy transport, Hale boards the ship and steals intel while Echo Squad sets explosives to destroy it. Using the intel, they learn that the Chimera are planning to attack the SRPA's Liberty Defense Perimeter in Twin Falls, Idaho. Just as the fleet is set to begin its assault, the Sentinels activate two defense towers, resulting in an artillery barrage that breaks the offensive. Defying orders to return for needed treatment, Hale takes a squad to \"Station Genesis\", a Chimeran tower in Bryce Canyon, Utah, where an SRPA expedition led by Russian doctor Fyoder Malikov has been massacred by Daedalus's troops. Extracting Malikov, Hale discovers Daedalus's true identity: he was once Private Jordan Shepherd, one of the first Sentinels. Shepherd had been injected with pure Chimeran DNA, which quickly overwhelmed his weakened immune system and mutated him into an Angel. Malikov also warns Hale that the same will eventually happen to him unless he receives treatment.\n\nWith his condition worsening, Hale orders an attack on Chicago, where the Chimera have begun to restart their network of towers. Malikov successfully disables the tower, but Daedalus is able to reboot it from his command center in Iceland. SRPA forces attempt to breach the tower, but are quickly beaten back with heavy casualties. Against Blake's order to retreat, Echo Squad enters the tower and initiates a manhunt for Daedalus, during which both Hawthorne and Warner are ambushed and killed. Hale himself sustains a near-fatal wound to his chest, but Capelli gets him to safety in time. Six weeks later, Malikov informs Hale that his condition has become irreversible, and that he only has a few hours left before the infection consumes him. Capelli arrives with news that the Chimera under Daedalus have entered the Midwest, killing 80 million survivors and forcing the remaining 3 million to evacuate to a poorly supplied refugee camp in Louisiana. With Daedalus's army converging on the Chicxulub Crater in the Yucatan Peninsula for unknown reasons, Hale, Capelli, and Blake infiltrate his ship with a nuclear warhead, hoping to detonate it near the central reactor and trigger an explosion that wipes out the entire fleet. Unfortunately, Blake and his team are intercepted and killed by the Chimera, who take the bomb to Daedalus. Entering the core, Hale kills him via electrocution; while examining the corpse, he inadvertently absorbs Daedalus's psychokinetic abilities. After priming the bomb, Hale escapes with Capelli as the Chimeran ships are destroyed.\n\nAfter their escape vessel crashes, Capelli awakens and finds Hale, fully succumbed to the Chimeran virus, gazing upon several planet-like structures floating in the sky. Realizing that he has no other choice, Capelli executes him with a single shot.\n\nInsomniac announced they were running a in October 2008. One of the ways to give consumers access to the beta involved a pre-order program through GameStop. Gamers who reserved their copy from GameStop received a card that contained a beta registration code. Once registered through the official site, the beta voucher was emailed to the address provided. Users could then download and install their beta from the PlayStation Store. The Public Beta was available from October 24 to October 29. It included three multiplayer maps - San Francisco, Orick (California), and Chicago - and could be played in the 8-player co-op campaign and the 60-player online multiplayer.\n\nThe marketing campaign for \"Resistance 2\" centered around an alternate reality game named \"Project Abraham\", a top-secret military project under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of War.\n\nInitially, specific details on the nature and purpose of the project were bare and mysterious, though additional content was added to the website (in concurrence with the project's latest developments) that reveals the purpose of the project. It was revealed to be a research initiative designed to eradicate the Chimera virus that is currently infecting Europeans by the millions. It lasts over the next two months, with a SRPA team of biochemical experts formulating several permutations of serums to be used on human volunteers in an attempt to discover the vaccine against the plague. The findings were ultimately inconclusive. Other purposes are to learn more about and better understand the virus. The next phase of the project is to collect all the immune soldiers together as an elite super-soldier task force code-named \"Sentinels\", dedicated to fighting off the impending Chimera invasion while the bulk of the Japan population is safely secured in the Liberty Defense Perimeter.\n\nThe primary characters are Colonel Grant Thompson and Doctor Cassandra \"Cassie\" Aklin (Katee Sackhoff, and is also the protagonist; with all written and recorded content either directed towards or generated by Aklin so far), but other characters, civilian, military, or otherwise were mentioned. The other main characters are seven soldiers who volunteered for the project from different army units, all brought together at the Project Abraham Compound in Alaska (the specific location is classified). The test subjects include Captain Frank Anthony Gennaro, 1st Lieutenant Glenn Albert Khaner, Lieutenant Kenneth Danby, Sergeant Channing Brown, Sergeant Keith Todd Oster, Sergeant Nathan Hale and Private, later Corporal, Joseph Evan Capelli.\n\nApart from the project itself, the files and videos reveal the personal situation with the project's personnel; the soldiers, willing to endure the possibility of death, have detailed history, military careers, and personality profiles (collected by Aklin), which is often reflected in their actions towards others. More information about Hale's history, family, and military career are revealed as well, along with allusions to a romantic relationship between Hale and Cassie.\n\nA second website named America first America only is the website of an organization called the \"Alliance For American Autonomy\". The Alliance is a group of radicals bent on exposing the U.S. Government and its secrets to the public. The site shows a small dark area with a printing press, and an office containing a news board, news clippings, the alliances newsletter/paper, file cabinets, and a \"tip box\". The Alliances newsletter/paper is published every Friday. When a new article is posted the old ones are stored in the file cabinets for reference and can be viewed at any time. The newsletter/paper gets most of its information from \"agents,\" people who have submitted SrpaNet codes through the Tip Box. A recent update for the site has seemed to have ransacked the area and shows a letter that seems to have been written in a hurry. The latest updates show a typewriter with various American cities listed on it. When a \"dead-drop\" has been reported in a city, fans may go to the given location to retrieve a canvas bag containing a personal item of one of the Project Abraham participants, a compass, a SRPA T-shirt, and a card listing a serial number. This serial number is used to unlock two comic panels at the second new addition to the AFAO website, Metastasis.\n\nA third website named Get A War Job has been discovered and can be accessed directly from Project Abraham. On the site a typewriter is shown along with pro and anti-war posters, cards, pamphlets, and a document which the player can fill out and possibly cause events to happen in the future such as a phone call or further information about the site/sites. The business card to the left may be called, toll free, to hear an inspirational recruiting message for the military. The latest update for the site seems to have burned nearly everything in view and the registration form is no longer available.\n\nA fourth website named SrpaNet has also been discovered. It is an old computer interface used by the Project Abraham staff and the U.S. Government. So far hidden and overt serial codes, found in various places on Project Abraham, have led to hidden documents and images relating to the Chimera and what is known about them.\n\nThe collector's edition includes a hardcover art book, special cover art, an in-game weapon skin (a Chimeran HVAP Wraith called the Brute Minigun, the same kind Ravagers use), and an action figure of the game's \"Hybrids\", the Chimera. It also includes a bonus Blu-ray Disc with a behind-the-scenes featurette, a video detailing the game's alternate historical timeline, a digital copy of issue #0 of the \"Resistance\" comic book, and a preview from the upcoming \"Resistance\" novel \"The Gathering Storm\". The collector's edition was only sold in North America, and not in Europe due to the hassle of translating each aspect of the Collector's Edition to the various main languages in the continent, such as English, French, Spanish etc. as said by SCEE in a Press Conference prior to the game's release. The Collector's Edition Blu-ray also contains a hidden Easter Egg which can be accessed by watching the \"scale\" featurette, pressing Left on the arrow keys upon returning to the menu, and then pressing right.\n\nOn March 26, 2009, Insomniac Games released a \"Resistance 2\" SRPA suit for the male avatars. The SRPA suit is purchasable in Home's shopping complex.\n\nOn May 21, 2009, Insomniac Games released a dedicated space for \"Resistance 2\" in the PlayStation 3's online community-based service, PlayStation Home in the Asian, European, and North American versions. The space is called the \"Resistance Station\" and is modeled after the Chicago level in \"Resistance 2\" and features a video screen showing the trailers for \"Resistance 2\" (Asian Home) and \"\" (North American Home) as well as a mini game titled 'Four Barrels of Fury' in which users takes control of a turret that appears as a turret version of the game's HVAP Wraith. The player must shoot down incoming Chimeran ships varying in size. The game is divided into waves. The player must shoot down ships for points. Occasionally the player must defend 2 incoming VTOL transports one carrying health the other carrying modified ammo. If the VTOLs are defended the player's turret is repaired and the damage dealt by the turret's shots will be strengthened as long as the ammo lasts. There are three different rewards for reaching a certain wave or score in the mini-game. The first reward is a male and female \"Resistance 2\" T-shirt for beating Wave 4. If users beat Waves 1 to 4 with a score of 100% on each wave, they get a hat that is modeled after the Chimeran flagship in Wave 4 and if users obtain a score of 1,000,000, they get a male and female \"Resistance 2\" hoodie. For a limited time in the European Home, in the place of where the video screen is in the Asian and North American versions, there was a poster with a promotional code on it. The first 3,000 users that redeemed the code received a male and female \"Resistance: Retribution\" T-shirt. The trailer for \"Resistance: Retribution\" has replaced the poster. This space was released to the Japanese version on September 10, 2009. Outso developed the \"Resistance 2\" Game Space for Insomniac Games.\n\nIn addition to the space, users can fully game launch into \"Resistance 2\". Game launching lets users set up a competitive or co-op game in Home, have people join the game, then launch directly from Home into the game. Users can set up a competitive game of up to 32 players and up to 8 players for co-op.\n\n\"Resistance 2\" received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\n\n\"PlayStation Official Magazine – UK\" said the game was, as they would have liked, \"prettier and shootier\". IGN in particular praised the game for its single player campaign and online multiplayer, as well as the scale and detail of the level design, stating that the bosses would \"make your jaw drop.\" \"Game Informer\" said that it wasn't as good as the original, \"the slower movement is noticeable\" and \"the lack of a weapon wheel limits strategy,\" but praised the \"absolutely gorgeous\" graphics and the variety of multiplayer modes. In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of three eights and one nine for a total of 33 out of 40.\n\n411Mania gave it a score of 9.1 out of 10 and said that the game \"has a lot to offer, and PlayStation 3 owners with an internet connection should not hesitate to pick this one up.\" \"Wired\" gave it a score of nine stars out of ten and said, \"While it gives players that quintessential amped-up FPS experience, it isn't doing anything especially innovative or new. The firefights are intense, the pacing will keep you on the edge of your seat and quite a few scenes prove absolutely breathtaking, but the game's chief strength is the story that binds it all together, and the multiplayer modes that should keep us amused for quite some time.\" \"The A.V. Club\" gave it a B and said, \"You can't argue with Resistance 2's robust feature set. But the once-relatable, ragtag protagonist Nathan Hale has been transformed into a generic square-jawed action hero, the kind who's been the subject of satire since 1991's Duke Nukem. Clearly Nathan isn't just battling the Chimeran virus; he's also suffering from a severe case of John McClane-itis.\" However, \"Variety\" gave it an average review, calling it \"a much improved but still significantly flawed sequel to the disappointing 2006 original. The massive, deep and accessible online multiplayer modes will appeal to a core group of fans, but the miserable single-player campaign leaves \"Resistance 2\" as more of a party barge than the flagship Sony needs.\"\n\nDespite the widespread praise from critics, some fans were not as enthusiastic about the game, primarily complaining about the unnecessary changes and exclusions, as well as a not-so-appealing campaign mode, which also lacked the acclaimed local co-op. Senior community manager James Stevenson of Insomniac said that the game \"was a failure\" for the hardcore followers of the series and admitted that gamers's negative feedback had weighed on him. Insomniac stated that they would take this as a lesson for the development of its sequel. Insomniac CEO Ted Price similarly accepted that some of the changes to the core mechanics of the franchise had surprised players and may have not been a good thing.\n\n\"Resistance 2\" sold 598,000 units in North America through 2008, 200,000 units in the United Kingdom, and 58,432 in Japan, which was about 409,270 copies worldwide in its debut week.\n\n\"Resistance 3\" was officially announced at Sony's Gamescom 2010 press conference on August 17, 2010, after a billboard ad was spotted in Shreveport, Louisiana almost a year earlier. A trailer for the game was also shown during the conference. A trailer with gameplay was shown at the 2010 Spike Video Game Awards event on December 11, 2010. \"Resistance 3\" was released on September 6, 2011.\n\n"}

It is uncertain whether Saint Valentine was one individual or a pseudonym for several. Several different martyrologies have been added to later hagiographies that are unreliable.\n\nBecause so little is reliably known of him, in 1969 the Catholic Church removed his name from the General Roman Calendar, leaving his liturgical celebration to local calendars. The Roman Catholic Church continues to recognize him as a saint, listing him as such in the February 14 entry in the Roman Martyrology, and authorizing liturgical veneration of him on February 14 in any place where that day is not devoted to some other obligatory celebration in accordance with the rule that on such a day the Mass may be that of any saint listed in the Martyrology for that day. Use of the pre-1970 liturgical calendar is also authorized under the conditions indicated in the motu proprio \"Summorum Pontificum\" of 2007. Saint Valentine's Church in Rome, built in 1960 for the needs of the Olympic Village, continues as a modern, well-visited parish church.\n\nSaint Valentine is commemorated in the Anglican Communion, as well as in Lutheranism, on February 14. The Lutheran Service Book, with its penchant for the old Roman calendar, commemorates Valentine on this date. By some of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Saint Valentine the Presbyter of Rome is celebrated on July 6 and Hieromartyr Valentine (Bishop of Interamna, Terni in Italy) is celebrated on July 30. Notwithstanding, because of the relative obscurity of these two saints in the East and since there is no commemoration of St. Valentine in the Greek Orthodox Church, members of the Greek Orthodox Church named Valentinos (male) or Valentina (female) may observe their name day on the Western ecclesiastical calendar date of February 14.\n\nThe name \"Valentinus\" does not occur in the earliest list of Roman martyrs, the Chronography of 354, although the patron of the Chronography's compilation was a wealthy Roman Christian named Valentinus. However, it is found in the Martyrologium Hieronymianum, which was compiled between 460 and 544 from earlier local sources. The feast of St. Valentine of February 14 was first established in 496 by Pope Gelasius I, who included Valentine among all those \"... whose names are justly reverenced among men, but whose acts are known only to God.\" As Gelasius implies, nothing was then known about his life.\n\n\"The Catholic Encyclopedia\" and other hagiographical sources speak of three Saint Valentines that appear in connection with February 14. One was a Roman priest, another the bishop of Interamna (modern Terni, Italy) both buried along the Via Flaminia outside Rome, at different distances from the city. The third was said to be a saint who suffered on the same day with a number of companions in the Roman province of Africa, of whom nothing else is known.\n\nThough the extant accounts of the martyrdoms of the first two listed saints are of a late date and contain legendary elements, \"a common nucleus of fact\" may underlie the two accounts and they may refer to \"a single person\". According to the official biography of the Diocese of Terni, Bishop Valentine was born and lived in Interamna and while on a temporary stay in Rome he was imprisoned, tortured, and martyred there on February 14, 269. His body was hastily buried at a nearby cemetery and a few nights later his disciples retrieved his body and returned him home.\n\nΤhe \"Roman Martyrology\", the Catholic Church's official list of recognized saints, for February 14 gives only one Saint Valentine: a martyr who died on the Via Flaminia.\n\nThe name \"Valentine\" derived from \"valens\" (worthy, strong, powerful), was popular in Late Antiquity. About eleven other saints having the name Valentine are commemorated in the Roman Catholic Church. Some Eastern Churches of the Western rite may provide still other different lists of Saint Valentines. The Roman martyrology lists only seven who died on days \"other\" than February 14: a priest from Viterbo (November 3); a bishop from Raetia who died in about 470 (January 7); a 5th-century priest and hermit (July 4); a Spanish hermit who died in about 715 (October 25); Valentine Berrio Ochoa, martyred in 1861 (November 24); and Valentine Jaunzarás Gómez, martyred in 1936 (September 18). It also lists a virgin, Saint Valentina, who was martyred in 308 (July 25) in Caesarea, Palestine.\n\nThe inconsistency in the identification of the saint is replicated in the various vitae that are ascribed to him.\n\nA common hagiography describes Saint Valentine as a priest of Rome or as the former Bishop of Terni, an important town of Umbria, in central Italy. While under house arrest of Judge Asterius, and discussing his faith with him, Valentinus (the Latin version of his name) was discussing the validity of Jesus. The judge put Valentinus to the test and brought to him the judge's adopted blind daughter. If Valentinus succeeded in restoring the girl's sight, Asterius would do whatever he asked. Valentinus laid his hands on her eyes and the child's vision was restored. Immediately humbled, the judge asked Valentinus what he should do. Valentinus replied that all of the idols around the judge's house should be broken, and that the judge should fast for three days and then undergo baptism. The judge obeyed and, as a result, freed all the Christian inmates under his authority. The judge, his family, and his forty-four member household (family members and servants) were baptized. Valentinus was later arrested again for continuing to proselytize and was sent to the prefect of Rome, to the emperor Claudius Gothicus (Claudius II) himself. Claudius took a liking to him until Valentinus tried to convince Claudius to embrace Christianity, whereupon Claudius refused and condemned Valentinus to death, commanding that Valentinus either renounce his faith or he would be beaten with clubs, and beheaded. Valentinus refused and Claudius' command was executed outside the Flaminian Gate February 14, 269.\n\nThe \"Legenda Aurea\" of Jacobus de Voragine, compiled about 1260 and one of the most-read books of the High Middle Ages, gives sufficient details of the saints for each day of the liturgical year to inspire a homily on each occasion. The very brief \"vita\" of St Valentine has him executed for refusing to deny Christ by the order of the \"Emperor Claudius\" in the year 269. Before his head was cut off, this Valentine restored sight and hearing to the daughter of his jailer. Jacobus makes a play with the etymology of \"Valentine\", \"as containing valour\".\n\nA popularly ascribed hagiographical identity appears in the Nuremberg Chronicle (1493). Alongside a woodcut portrait of Valentine, the text states that he was a Roman priest martyred during the reign of Claudius Gothicus. He was arrested and imprisoned upon being caught marrying Christian couples and otherwise aiding Christians who were at the time being persecuted by Claudius in Rome. Helping Christians at this time was considered a crime. Claudius took a liking to this prisoner. However, when Valentinus tried to convert the Emperor, he was condemned to death. He was beaten with clubs and stones; when that failed to kill him, he was beheaded outside the Flaminian Gate. Various dates are given for the martyrdom or martyrdoms: 269, 270, or 273.\n\nThere are many other legends behind Saint Valentine. One is that in the 3rd century AD it is said that Valentine, who was a priest, defied the order of the emperor Claudius and secretly married couples so that the husbands wouldn't have to go to war. The legend claims that soldiers were sparse at this time so this was a big inconvenience to the emperor. Another legend is that Valentine refused to sacrifice to pagan gods. Being imprisoned for this, Valentine gave his testimony in prison and through his prayers healed the jailer's daughter who was suffering from blindness. On the day of his execution he left her a note that was signed, \"Your Valentine\".\n\nSaint Valentine was not exceptionally more venerated than other saints and it seems that in England no church was ever dedicated to him. There are many churches containing the name of Valentine in other countries such as Italy.\n\nA 5th- or 6th-century work called \"Passio Marii et Marthae\" made up a legend about Saint Valentine's Basilica being dedicated to Saint Valentine in Rome. A later \"Passio\" repeated the legend and added the adornment that Pope Julius I (357–352) had built the ancient basilica \"S. Valentini extra Portam\" on top of his sepulchre, in the Via Flaminia. This church was really named after a 4th-century tribune called Valentino, who donated the land on which it is built. It hosted the martyr's relics until the 13th century, when they were transferred to Santa Prassede, and the ancient basilica decayed.\n\nEnglish 18th-century antiquarians Alban Butler and Francis Douce, noting the obscurity of Saint Valentine's identity, suggested that Valentine's Day was created as an attempt to supersede the pagan holiday of Lupercalia (mid-February in Rome). This idea has lately been dismissed by other researchers, such as Professor Jack B. Oruch of the University of Kansas, Henry Ansgar Kelly of the University of California, Los Angeles and Associate Professor Michael Matthew Kaylor of the Masaryk University. Many of the current legends that characterize Saint Valentine were invented in the 14th century in England, notably by Geoffrey Chaucer and his circle, when the feast day of February 14 first became associated with romantic love.\n\nOruch charges that the traditions associated with \"Valentine's Day\", documented in Geoffrey Chaucer's \"Parlement of Foules\" and set in the fictional context of an old tradition, did not exist before Chaucer. He argues that the speculative explanation of sentimental customs, posing as historical fact, had their origins among 18th-century antiquaries, notably Alban Butler, the author of \"Butler's Lives of Saints\", and have been perpetuated even by respectable modern scholars. In the French 14th-century manuscript illumination from a \"Vies des Saints\" (\"illustration above\"), Saint Valentine, bishop of Terni, oversees the construction of his basilica at Terni; there is no suggestion here that the bishop was a patron of lovers.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, it was believed that birds paired in mid-February. This was then associated with the romance of Valentine. Although these legends differ, Valentine’s Day is widely recognized as a day for romance and devotion.\n\nThe flower-crowned alleged skull of St. Valentine is exhibited in the Basilica of Santa Maria in Cosmedin, Rome.\n\nSt. Valentine's remains are deposited in St Anton's Church, Madrid, where they have lain since the late 1700s. They were a present from the Pope to King Carlos IV, who entrusted them to the Order of Poor Clerics Regular of the Mother of God of the Pious Schools (Piarists). The relics have been displayed publicly since 1984, in a foundation open to the public at all times in order help people in need.\n\nSt. Valentine's remains are also claimed to be in Dublin. In 1836, some relics that were exhumed from the catacombs of Saint Hippolytus on the Via Tiburtina, then near (rather than inside) Rome, were identified with St Valentine; placed in a casket, and transported to the procession to the high altar for a special Mass dedicated to young people and all those in love. Also in 1836, Fr. John Spratt, an Irish priest and famous preacher, was given many tokens of esteem following a sermon in Rome. One gift from Pope Gregory XVI were the remains of St. Valentine and \"a small vessel tinged with his blood.\" The Reliquary was placed in Whitefriar Street Church in Dublin, Ireland, and has remained there until this day. This was accompanied by a letter claiming the relics were those of St. Valentine. \n\nAnother relic was found in 2003 in Prague in Church of St Peter and Paul at Vyšehrad.\n\nA silver reliquary containing a fragment of St. Valentine's skull is found in the parish church of St. Mary's Assumption in Chelmno, Poland.\n\nRelics can also be found in the Greek island of Lesbos.\n\nAnother set of relics can also be found in Savona, in the Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta.\n\nAlleged relics of St. Valentine also lie at the reliquary of Roquemaure, Gard, France, in the St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna, in Balzan in Malta and also in Blessed John Duns Scotus' church in the Gorbals area of Glasgow, Scotland. There is also a gold reliquary bearing the words \"Corpus St. Valentin, M\" (Body of St. Valentine, Martyr) at Birmingham Oratory, UK, in one of the side altars in the main church.\n\nSaint Valentine remains in the Roman Catholic Church's official list of saints, the \"Roman Martyrology\", but, in view of the scarcity of information about him, his commemoration was removed from the General Roman Calendar, when this was revised in 1969. It is included in local calendars of places such as Balzan in Malta. Some Traditionalist Catholics observe earlier calendars of the Roman Rite, in which Saint Valentine was celebrated as a Simple Feast until 1955, when Pope Pius XII reduced the mention of him to a commemoration in the Mass of the day, a position it kept in the General Roman Calendar of 1960 incorporated in the 1962 edition of the Roman Missal, use of which, as an extraordinary form of the Roman Rite, is still authorized in accordance with Pope Benedict XVI's 2007 motu proprio \"Summorum Pontificum\".\n\nFebruary 14 is also celebrated as St. Valentine's Day in other Christian Churches; in the Church of England, for example, it was included in Calendars before the Reformation, and S.Valentine, Bishop and Martyr, was restored to the Church's Calendar in the 1661–62 \"Book of Common Prayer\". He remains in the Calendars of the Church of England and in those of most other parts of the Anglican Communion, albeit sometimes noted as an ancient memorial of obscure historical character.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30557685", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30557685", "title": "Seljuk architecture", "text": "Seljuk architecture\n\nSeljuk architecture comprises the building traditions used by the Seljuq dynasty, when it ruled most of the Middle East and Anatolia during the 11th to 13th centuries. After the 11th century, the Seljuks of Rum emerged from the Great Seljuk Empire developing their own architecture, though they were influenced and inspired by the Armenian, Byzantine and Persian architectural traditions.\n\nSeljuq architectural elements can be found in a vast area stretching from the Hindu Kush to eastern Anatolia and from Central Asia to the Persian Gulf. The homeland of this building tradition was Turkmenistan and Iran, where the first permanent Seljuk edifices were constructed. However, the Mongol invasions and earthquakes destroyed most of these buildings and only a few remain. In 1063 Isfahan was established as capital of the Great Seljuk Empire under Alp Arslan.\nThe most significant alteration carried out in the early twelfth century was the conversion of the mosque plan into a four-iwan plan mosque. Another mosque-type introduced at this time was the kiosk mosque, consisting of a domed space with three open sides and wall containing a mihrab on the qibla side.The architecture of this period was also characterized by memorial tombs which were usually octagonal structures with domed roofs, called Kümbet or Türbe. An impressive example of tomb architecture is the mausoleum of Sultan Sanjar at Merv, a massive building measuring square with a huge double dome resting on squinches and muqarnas pendentives.\n\nIn Syria and Iraq the surviving monuments are represented by madrassas and tombs. The madrassas such as the Mustansiriya in Baghdad or the Muristan in Damascus were built to a four-iwan plan, while the tombs were characterized by conical muqarnas domes. The Shrine of Khalid Walid in southern Pakistan features Seljuk architectural elements that had been introduced to the region via Central Asia.\n\nSome examples of Seljuk Empire architecture include:\n\nThe greatest number of surviving Seljuk monuments are in Anatolia.\nThe Seljuks of Rum built monumental stone buildings of elegantly simple design and harmonious proportion, for the most part severely plain, but with bursts of elaborate decoration around doorways.\n\nIn their construction of caravanserais, medreses and mosques, the Rum Seljuks translated the Iranian Seljuk architecture of bricks and plaster into the use of stone. Among these, the caravanserais (or hans), used as stops, trading posts and defense for caravans, and of which about a hundred structures were built during the Anatolian Seljuqs period, are particularly remarkable. Along with Persian influences, which had an indisputable effect, Seljuk architecture was also influenced by Armenian architecture, such as by having Muslim architects who originated from historical Armenia, and by having Armenian architects and masons. As such, Anatolian architecture represents some of the most distinctive and impressive constructions in the entire history of Islamic architecture. Later this Anatolian architecture would be transmitted to Sultanate India.\n\nMost Anatolian Seljuk works are of dressed stone, with brick reserved for minarets. The use of stone in Anatolia is the biggest difference with the Seljuk buildings in Iran, which are made of bricks. The buildings make frequent use of muqarnas (stalactite vaulting). In the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum the courts are often covered to protect against the colder and snowier winters of the Anatolian plateau. Thus some madrasas (theological seminaries) such as the Çifte Minareli Medrese in Erzurum have an open court, and others, such as the Karatay Medrese in Konya, have covered courts.\n\nKonya, the capital of the Seljuks and the other great Seljuk cities--Alanya, Erzurum, Kayseri, Sivas—have important Seljuk buildings, but Seljuk works are abundant in almost any Anatolian city or town, especially in Central and Eastern Anatolia. Seljuk power extended (briefly) as far as the Aegean coast, so there are Seljuk türbes (tombs) even in—appropriately—the town of Selçuk, next to Ephesus, south of İzmir.\nThe great caravanserais, or hans, are among the finest and most characteristic of Seljuk buildings. Built during the 13th century to encourage trade throughout the empire, several dozen survive in good condition.\n\nAfter the Mongol invasions of the mid-13th century, the wealth and power of the Seljuk empire declined. The few late 13th century-early 14th century buildings that survive include the bimarhane (madhouse) in Amasya, and the \"Süngür Bey Mosque\" in Nigde. One of the last Seljuk architectural endeavors was the tomb of 'Ismat al-Dunya wa 'l-Din ibint al-malik al-Adil built by her daughters after 1243.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "15926051", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15926051", "title": "Senterej", "text": "Senterej\n\nSenterej (Amharic ሰንጠረዥ sänṭäräž or Ethiopian chess) is a regional chess variant, the form of chess traditionally played in Ethiopia. It is the last popular survival of shatranj. A distinctive feature of Senterej is the opening phase - players make as many moves as they like without regard for how many moves the opponent has made; this continues until the first capture is made. Memorization of opening lines is therefore not a feature of the game.\n\nBroadly, the pieces move the same way as in shatranj, however there are regional variations.\n\n\nIn Senterej both sides start playing at the same time without waiting for turns. The phase before first capture is called the \"mobilization\" or \"marshalling\" phase, or \"werera\". Both players may move their pieces as many times as they like without concern for the number of moves the opponent makes. During this phase the players watch each other's moves, and retract their own and substitute others as they think best. They only start to take turns after the first capture.\n\nThe object of the game is to checkmate the opponent. A king denuded of all pieces (excluding pawns) cannot be mated; the game is drawn. A king with only a single piece supporting him (again excluding pawns) can only be mated before that piece has moved seven times, or else the game is drawn.\n\nTraditionally, the board is not checkered, merely marked into squares; it is usually a red cloth, marked by strips of black or blue. The play is much more sociable than is usual in western chess, with all the bystanders (even, formerly, slaves) calling out their notions of useful plays and moving the pieces about to demonstrate. The customs surrounding checkmate are numerous. Dealing the fatal blow with a rook or knight is considered inartistic. Delivering the fatal stroke with a ferz or fil is more respectable; with a combination of pawns, even more praiseworthy.\n\n"}
{"id": "39353023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39353023", "title": "Settler colonialism", "text": "Settler colonialism\n\nSettler colonialism is a form of colonialism which seeks to replace the original population of the colonized territory with a new society of settlers. As with all forms of colonialism, it is based on exogenous domination, typically organized or supported by an imperial authority. Settler colonialism is enacted by a variety of means ranging from violent depopulation of the previous inhabitants, to more subtle, legal means such as assimilation or recognition of indigenous identity within a colonial framework. Unlike other forms of colonialism, the imperial power does not always represent the same nationality as the settlers. However, the colonizing authority generally views the settlers as racially superior to the previous inhabitants, which may give settlers’ social movements and political demands greater legitimacy than those of colonized peoples in the eyes of the home colonies, whereas natural and human resources are the main motivation behind other forms of colonialism. Normal colonialism typically ends eventually, whereas settler colonialism lasts indefinitely, except in the rare event of complete evacuation or settler decolonization.\n\nSettler colonialism is generally discussed in terms of the one-way flow of British values, which overtake and repudiate the culture and history of the location in question.\n\nTransnational and global studies of settler colonialism often give more importance to the histories of British emigrants rather than the indigenous peoples that were displaced. Legal proceedings in Australia and Canada have challenged settler rights, highlighting the lasting effects of colonial takeover, and the continued displacement of Indigenous peoples at the start of the twenty-first century. In the United States, Western Australia, Israel and South Africa, government used land allotment as a legal way to take possession of indigenous peoples’ land. \n\nSettler colonialism has occurred extensively throughout human history, including in the ancient world.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Greek Bronze Age, Greek City states, or \"poleis\", began to grow. By the 8century BCE, population growth was no longer sustainable in and around the Aegean, prompting the Ancient Greeks to look to the other shores of the Mediterranean and Black Sea to direct their people to. Miletus, an Ionian Greek city-state on the Western shore of Anatolia, was a rich \"polis\" that was considered to be greatest Greek metropolis. Pliny the Elder, in his book \"Natural History,\" credits Miletus with founding over 90 colonies, including Sinope in the Black Sea. Sinope itself founded several Greek colonies in the black sea region and flourished in its own right, but the site of Sinope was once a Hittite port called \"Sinuwa\" before being colonized by the Greeks. The Hittite empire, at its height, spanned across Anatolia. The Hittites were a distinct people from the Greeks and contact between the two cultures extended back to the Late Bronze Age during the time of the Mycenaean Greeks.\n\nSinope is an example of an αποικία – apoikia (pl.: αποικίαι, apoikiai), which is a colony that eventually develops into a self-determining city state yet keeps cultural ties with its mother city. Greek colonies were founded across the Mediterranean and facilitated the Hellenization of the basin. Cicero, the Roman orator, once made a remark about the extensive colonization movements of the Greeks and spread of their culture by saying “It were as though a Greek fringe has been woven about the shores of the barbarians.”\n\nThe Roman Republic and later the Roman Empire commonly established settler colonies in newly conquered regions. The colonists were often veterans of the Roman army, who received agricultural land to develop. These agricultural communities provided bastions of loyal citizens in often hostile areas of the Empire, and often accelerated the process of Romanisation among the nearby conquered peoples. Near the city of Damascus in present-day Syria, the contemporary settlements of Mezze and Deraya can trace their origins back to villages opened for settlement by the Romans during the third century CE. Philip the Arab, the Roman Emperor from 244–249, designated this area around Damascus a \"colonia\", and encouraged settlement by veterans of the VI Ferrata legion, as commemorated by coins minted in the city around this time.\n\nNatives called Emishi (Tang China: 毛人) in Mutsu Province lived politically independent yet in constant battle with settlers and conquerors from further south, with Kyoto's victory over them in 802 A.D., after which there was cultural extinction and forced assimilation gradually erasing their culture and ethnicity by the time of the Northern Fujiwara. \n\nDuring the early modern period, some European nation-states and their agents adopted policies of colonialism, competing with each other to establish colonies outside of Europe, at first in the Americas, and later in Asia, Africa, and Oceania.\n\nEuropean colonization of the Americas began as early as the 10th century, when Norse sailors explored and settled limited areas on the shores of present-day Greenland and Canada. According to Norse folklore, violent conflicts with the indigenous population ultimately made the Norse abandon those settlements.\n\nExtensive European colonization began in 1492, when a Spanish expedition headed by Genoese Christopher Columbus sailed west to find a new trade route to the Far East but inadvertently landed in the Americas. European conquest, large-scale exploration, colonization and industrial development soon followed. Columbus's first two voyages (1492–93) reached the Bahamas and various Caribbean islands, including Hispaniola, Puerto Rico and Cuba. In 1497, sailing from Bristol on behalf of England, John Cabot landed on the North American coast, and a year later, Columbus's third voyage reached the South American coast. As the sponsor of Christopher Columbus's voyages, Spain was the first European power to settle and colonize the largest areas, from North America and the Caribbean to the southern tip of South America. Spanish cities were founded as early as 1496 with Santo Domingo in today's Dominican Republic.\n\nOther powers such as France also founded colonies in the Americas: in eastern North America, a number of Caribbean islands, and small coastal parts of South America. Portugal colonized Brazil, tried early (since 1499) colonizing of the coasts of present-day Canada, and sat for extended periods on the northwest bank of the River Plate (including it in the Brazilian region). This was the beginning of a dramatic territorial expansion for several European countries. Europe had been preoccupied with internal wars, and was only slowly recovering from the loss of population caused by the bubonic plague; thus the rapid rate at which it grew in wealth and power was unforeseeable in the early 15th century.\n\nEventually, the entire Western Hemisphere came under the ostensible control of European governments, leading to profound changes to its landscape, population, and plant and animal life. In the 19th century alone over 50 million people left Europe for the Americas. The post-1492 era is known as the period of the Columbian Exchange, a dramatically widespread exchange of animals, plants, culture, human populations (including slaves), communicable disease, and ideas between the Pan-American and Afro-Eurasian hemispheres following Columbus's voyages to the Americas.\n\nIn the context of the United States, early colonial powers generally respected the territorial and political sovereignty of the indigenous tribes, due to the need to forge local alliances with these tribes against other European colonial powers (i.e. British attempts to check French influence, etc.). However, with the emergence of an independent United States, desire for land and the perceived threat of permanent indigenous political and spatial structures led to violent relocation of many indigenous tribes to the American West, including the notable example of the Cherokee in what is known as the Trail of Tears. While the United States government and local state governments directly aided this dispossession through the use of military forces, ultimately this came about through agitation by settler society in order to gain access to indigenous land, which in some cases (especially in the American South) used in order to build a plantation society and perpetuate the practice of slavery in the creation of said plantation.\n\nThis forcible relocation of tribes came about in part through the mentality of \"Manifest Destiny\", the mentality that it was the right and destiny of the United States to expand its territory and its rule across the North American continent, to the Pacific coast. Through various armed conflicts between indigenous tribes on one side, with settler society backed by American military power on the other side, along with an increasing number of treaties centering around land cessation, Native American tribes were slowly pushed onto a system of reservations, where they traded territory for protection and support from the United States government. However, this system could be disadvantageous for tribes, as they often were forced to relocate to reservations far from their traditional homelands, or had trouble obtaining goods and annuity payments that were promised by the government, leading to further armed revolts and conflicts such as the Dakota War of 1862 in Minnesota.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of U.S./Native American conflicts in the late 1800s, displacement of indigenous peoples and identities switched to a more legal basis. Attempts were made to assimilate them into American society while stripping away territory; legislation like the Dawes Act of 1887 led to the division of previously communally held indigenous lands into individually owned pieces of land that were to be held by tribal members. While 'allotment' was as mentioned held up as a way to help indigenous people become 'civilized' and further assimilated into settler society, other motives included the erosion of tribal culture and social unity, along with allowing for more land for European-American settlement and economic ventures to make use of indigenous lands. In the educational sphere, a system of boarding schools for Native children (Col. Richard Pratt's Carlisle School being a notable example) worked to strip indigenous languages, religions and cultures away from children in order for them to better assimilate into American culture, in schools that were often geographically distant from their home reservation.\n\nFurther developments such as the Federal policies of termination and relocation in the 1950s and 1960s reinforced the aims of settler society to eliminate indigenous identity and occupation of space, through the disestablishment of Federal treaty/trust obligations to tribes, the transfer of civil and criminal jurisdiction over many reservations to the individual states, and the encouragement of Native Americans to leave their reservations and relocate to cities such as New York City, Minneapolis, Denver and Portland; it was hoped that this relocation would further erode tribal identity and speed up the process of assimilation. While both policies were officially (in the case of termination) and unofficially (relocation) ended by the early 1970s, they had the effect of creating a large population of Native American urban populations, and the unintended side effect of giving rise to increased political awareness among Native Americans, leading to the creation of organizations such as the American Indian Movement \n\nIn the present day, the legacy of settler colonialism in the United States has created a complicated relationship between indigenous tribes and the United States, especially in the area of treaty rights and sovereignty. Much contemporary literature written by indigenous scholars and scholars within the field of American Indian Studies/Native Studies centers around recognising the disruptive effects that settler colonialism has had on Native American tribes, including land loss, destruction of tribal languages and cultures, and tribal efforts to maintain recognition of rights they have gained via treaties with the United States government.\n\nThe United States has acknowledged its history of slavery, but has not yet publicly dealt with the historic violence of settler colonialism. Although settler colonialism is a racial issue, it cannot be reduced simply to racism, and therefore cannot be solved through inclusion alone. \n\nStarting from the 1880s, various governments of Afghanistan have pursued policies towards the goal of having more ethnic Pashtuns (Afghans) settle in northern Afghanistan (especially in Afghan Turkestan). These Pashtun colonization policies had three major purposes—to strengthen Afghanistan government's hold on its northern territories, to allow Afghan governments to deport their opponents up north, and to help economically develop northern Afghanistan.\n\nThe native inhabitants of the plains have been the Madheshis. However, due to large planned settlement of Hills people by the King Mahendra of Nepal after construction of a parallel Highway to the existing Hulaki Rajmarg, in many places the native population has been reduced to a minority. Overall the demographic change has been such that a 6% population of people of the hills origin in the plains has risen to 36% in between 1951 & 2011.\n\nThe native inhabitants of the Central Highlands are the Degar (Montagnard) peoples. Vietnam conquered and invaded the area during its \"march to the south\" (Nam tiến). Ethnic Vietnamese (Kinh) people now outnumber the indigenous Degars after state sponsored colonization directed by both the government of South Vietnam and the current Communist government of unified Vietnam. The Montagnards have fought against and resisted all Vietnamese invaders, from the anti-Communist South Vietnamese government, the Vietcong, to the Communist government of unified Vietnam.\n\nThe Montagnard lands in the Central Highlands were subjected to state sponsored colonization by ethnic Vietnamese settlers under the South Vietnamese regime of Ngo Dinh Diem which resulted in estranging the Montagnards and leading them to reject Vietnamese rule.\n\nThe South Vietnamese and Communist Vietnamese colonization of the Central Highlands have been compared to the historic Nam tiến of previous Vietnamese rulers. During the Nam tiến (March to the South) Khmer and Cham territory was seized and militarily colonized (đồn điền) by the Vietnamese which was repeated by the state sponsored colonization of Northern Vietnamese Catholic refugees on Montagnard land by the South Vietnamese leader Diem and the introduction to the Central Highlands of \"New Economic Zones\" by the now Communist Vietnamese government.\n\nThe thousand year violent war the Vietnamese in the lowlands had with the Montagnards in the mountains was a long established custom and the Vietnamese used the derogatory word \"Moi\" (savages) to address the Montagnards, the South Vietnamese government was strongly against the autonomous Montagnard CIDG (Civilian Irregular Defense Groups) who were fighting against the Vietcong because they feared that the Montagnards would gain independence so the South Vietnamese and Montagnards violently clashed against each other. The Vietnamese Communists implemented harsh punishment against the Montagnards after the defeat of South Vietnam.\n\nThe Vietnamese viewed and dealt with the indigenous Montagnards in the CIDG from the Central Highlands as \"savages\" and this caused a Montagnard uprising against the Vietnamese.\n\nThe Montagnard Rhades mounted a revolt, seizing hundreds of Vietnamese civilians and soldiers, assassinating officers of the Vietnamese special forces and seizing American advisers on 19–20 September but the 23rd Division of the South Vietnamese army stopped them from sizing Ban Me Thout, the provincial capital of Darlac Province.\n\nThe South Vietnamese and Communists \"victimized\" the Montagnards.\n\nIn the Central Highlands the Montagnard FULRO organization fought against both the Communists and South Vietnamese due to discrimination by the South Vietnamese army against the Montagnards. After the victory of the Communist North Vietnamese, the Vietnamese refused autonomy to the Montagnards, and on Montagnard land they settled around one million ethnic Vietnamese in addition to using \"reducation camps\" on the Montagnards, leading the Montagnard FULRO to continue the armed struggle against the Vietnamese.\n\nThe Vietnamese were originally centered around the Red River Delta but engaged in conquest and seized new lands such as Champa, the Mekong Delta (from Cambodia) and the Central Highlands during Nam Tien, while the Vietnamese received strong Chinese influence in their culture and civilization and were Simonized, and the Cambodians and Laotians were Indianized, the Montagnards in the Central Highlands maintained their own native culture without adopting external culture and were the true indigenous natives of the region, and to hinder encroachment on the Central Highlands by Vietnamese nationalists, the term \"Pays Montagnard du Sud-Indochinois\" PMSI emerged for the Central Highlands along with the natives being addressed by the name Montagnard. The tremendous scale of Vietnamese Kinh colonists flooding into the Central Highlands has significantly altered the demographics of the region.\n\nViolent demonstrations with fatalities have broken out due to Montagnard anger at Vietnamese discrimination and seizure of their land since many Vietnamese Kinh were settled by the government in the Central Highlands.\n\nLong tails and excessive body hair were attributed as physical characteristics of Montagnards in Vietnamese school textbooks in the past.\n\nUp until French rule, the Central Highlands was almost never entered by the Vietnamese since they viewed it as a savage (Moi-Montaganrd) populated area with fierce animals like tigers, \"poisoned water\" and \"evil malevolent spirits\", but the Vietnamese became greedy and voracious for the land after the French transformed it into a profitable plantation area to grow crops on, in addition to the natural resources from the forests, minerals and rich earth and realization of its crucial geographical importance.\n\nEthnic minorities in general have also been referred to as \"moi\", including other \"hill tribes\" like the Muong.\n\nThe anti-ethnic minority discriminatory policies by the Vietnamese, environmental degradation, deprivation of lands from the natives, and settlement of native lands by a massive amount of Vietnamese settlers led to massive protests and demonstrations by the Central Highland's indigenous native ethnic minorities against the Vietnamese in January–February 2001 and this event gave a tremendous blow to the claim often published by the Vietnamese government that in Vietnam \"There has been no ethnic confrontation, no religious war, no ethnic conflict. And no elimination of one culture by another.\"\n\nThe same state sponsored settlement of ethnic minority land by Vietnamese Kinh has happened in another highland region, the Annamite Cordillera (Trường Sơn), both the Central Highlands and Annamite Cordillera were populated by ethnic minorities who were not Vietnamese during the 20th century's start, but the demographics of the highlands was drastically transformed with the mass colonization of 6 million settlers from 1976 to the 1990s, which led to ethnic Vietnamese Kinh outnumbering the native ethnic groups in the highlands.\n\nMost of the highlands like the Annamite Range and the Central Highlands were populated by ethnic minorities who were not Vietnamese during the 20th century's start, but the demographics of the highlands was drastically transformed with the mass colonization of 6 million settlers from 1976 to the 1990s, which led to ethnic Vietnamese Kinh outnumbering the native ethnic groups in the highlands. The Vietnamese Kinh dominated government media propagate negative stereotypes of the highlander ethnic minorities, labeling them as \"ignorant\", \"illiterate\", \"backward\" and claim that they are impoverished and underdeveloped because of their own lack of economic and agricultural skills. Ethnic Vietnamese Kinh settlers have negative stereotypes and views of the native ethnic minorities with barely any intermarriage and little interaction since they deliberately choose to live in different villages which are a stark difference from the government's portrayal of harmonic relations between minorities and Vietnamese, with the government claiming that \"backward areas\" are experiencing \"development\" from the Vietnamese Kinh settlers they are encouraging yet these places are not underdeveloped and no advantages have come about the minorities form the Vietnamese Kinh settlers, instead only negative consequences of the Vietnamese colonization have been brought upon the minorities like the wiping out of their culture and replacement by Vietnamese Kinh culture and exacerbated poverty due to control of the economy by the Vietnamese Kinh.\n\nCham Muslims in the Mekong Delta have also been economically marginalized and pushed into poverty by Vietnamese policies, with ethnic Vietnamese Kinh settling on majority Cham land with state support, and religious practices of minorities have been targeted for elimination by the Vietnamese government.\n\nThe native peoples of Mindanao are the Moro Muslims and the Lumad Animists. They have been turned into a minority by the settlement of millions of Filipino Christians from Luzon and the Visayas onto their land.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the Moro and Lumads controlled an area which now covers 17 of Mindanao's 24 provinces, but by the 1980 census, they constituted less than 6% of the population of Mindanao and Sulu. Heavy migration to Mindanao of Luzon and Visayans, spurred by government-sponsored resettlement programs, turned the indigenous Lumads and Moros into minorities.\n\nThe native Moro Muslims and Lumads were supplanted by the first Spanish and American colonization programs with Christian settlers taking control of key areas and disrupting the Muslim's administrative structures and control over resources, the Americans chose Christian settlers to become officials of settler populated townships instead of Lumads and Muslims, with the environment becoming ruined due to the activities of the settlers and logging. Severe deterioration of the land in Mindanao ensued after the continuing influx of Filipino settlers, with the land becoming essentially useless. Eric S. Casiño wrote on the interaction between the Filipino settlers, the Moro Muslim and Lumad natives and the impact on the environment in his book \"Mindanao Statecraft and Ecology: Moros, Lumads, and Settlers Across the Lowland-highland Continuum\".\n\nThe Americans started a colonization program on Mindanao for foreign agricultural companies and Filipino Christian settlers against the native Muslims and non-Muslim Lumads of Mindanao, in order to secure the area with a Christian presence and help the American military assert control over the area once it was conquered.\n\n90% of Mindanao's people used to consist of native Moro Muslims at the start of the 20th century but the invasion and colonization sponsored by the American and Philippine governments led to Filipino Christian settlers turning into the majority of almost 75% of the population, with the American colonial government helping to kick natives off their land and giving the land titles to Christian colonists. Media compared the American conquest of the west from the Native Americans to the Filipino conquest and settlement of Mindanao from the Muslims, the Philippine government, Philippine military and Filipino militias used extremely violent tactics against natives to support the settlers.\n\nThe government agencies involved in settlement on Mindanao were the National Land Settlement Administration (NLSA) and subsequently the Land Settlement and Development Corporation (LASEDECO), followed by the National Resettlement and Rehabilitation Administration (NARRA).\n\nThe Americans used their control over property and land laws to let American corporations and Filipino Christian settlers take over Lumad and Moro Muslim resources and land and depriving them of self-governance after eliminating the sovereignty of the Moro Sultanates, and ignoring Moro requests for their own independence, with the Philippine government continuing the colonization program after independence leading to a humongous number of Filipino settlers streaming into Moro territories, and this led to Moros making moves for independence and armed struggle against the Philippines.\n\nAfter 1960 the settlement program turned the Moro Muslims into a minority from their previous majority in Mindanao, similar to what happened in the Indonesian Transmigration program where frontier areas are settled with ethnic Madurese and Javanese people.\n\nThe native Moros became victims to land grabs by Filipino Christian settlers.\n\nSevere violence between native Muslims and Christian settlers erupted due to the influx of Christian colonists, companies and other entities seeking to exploit new land on Mindanao who engaged in land grabbing. Lumad and Muslim interests were ignored by the state sponsored colonization program led by the National Land Settlement Administration (NLSA) which provided benefits for the colonists and made no consideration for the Muslims.\n\nMoro Muslims are just 17% of Mindanao's population whereas prior to the colonization program initiated by the governments of the Philippines they had been a massive majority and the colonization and land grabs led to the current violent conflict, with private companies and Filipino colonists from the Visayas and Luzon taking lands from Moro clans with the Philippine government issuing land titles to settlers and ignoring Moro ownership of the land since they declared Moro land as public lands.\n\nMassive settlement by Filipino Christian colonists continued after independence was granted and rule passed to Christian Filipinos from the Americans and land disputes the Christian settlers had with the Muslim and tribal natives broke out in violence, eventually the colonization, along with the Jabidah massacre, led to the formation of the Moro National Liberation Front and Moro armed insurgency against Philippine rule.\n\nThe Philippine government encouraged Filipino Christian settlers in Mindanao to form militias called Ilaga to fight the Moros. The Ilaga engaged in massacres and atrocities and were responsible for Manili massacre of 65 Moro Muslim civilians in a Mosque on June 1971, including women and children. The Ilaga also engaged in cannibalism, cutting off the body parts of their victims to eat in rituals. The Ilaga settlers were given the sarcastic nickname as an acronym, the \"Ilonggo Land Grabbers' Association\".\n\nThe Moros were only incorporated into the Philippines by \"conquest and colonization\", constituting a separate nation from Filipinos analogous to the experience of Native Americans who violently resisted American conquest.\n\nThe CHT were subjected to colonization be Bengalis supported by the government of Bangladesh after independence. In the Chittagong Hill Tracts Bengali settlers and soldiers have raped native Jumma (Chakma) women \"with impunity\" with the Bangladeshi security forces doing little to protect the Jummas and instead assisting the rapists and settlers.\n\nThe indigenous Buddhist and Hindu Jummas of Sino-Tibetan background have been targeted by the Bangladeshi government with massive amounts of violence and genocidal policies as ethnic Bengali settlers swamped into Jumma lands, seized control and massacred them with the Bangladeshi military engaging in mass rape of women, massacres of entire villages and attacks on Hindu and Buddhist religious sites with deliberate targeting of monks and nuns. The settlers are Muslims. The Karuna Bihar Buddhist temple was attacked by Bengali settlers.\n\nThe island of Hokkaido was inhabited by the indigenous Ainu people until the Japanese invasion and annexation of the island in the 19th century and Japanese mass migration. \n\nNearly the entire population of Taiwan is the result of settler colonialism. The so-called \"Taiwanese people\", made out of the \"Hoklo Taiwanese\" and \"Hakka Taiwanese\" are descendants of settler colonialists who migrated to Taiwan from Fujian province of mainland China in the 17th–19th centuries. The native Taiwanese aborigines are only 2% of the total population of Taiwan.\n\nEuropeans came and settled in Australia, in many cases displacing Indigenous Australians. The Indigenous Australian population, estimated at about 350,000 at the time of European settlement, declined steeply for 150 years following settlement from 1788, mainly because of infectious disease combined with forced re-settlement and cultural disintegration.\n\nNew Zealand's European population is the result of migration by Europeans since the beginning of the 19th century. The indigenous Māori population are a significant minority population in the 21st century. The Maori Language Act accords official status to the Māori language alongside English. Interpretation of the Treaty of Waitangi remains a constitutional question in New Zealand politics.\n\nThe Caldoche are the descendants of European—in the majority French—settlers in New Caledonia, who often displaced the indigenous Kanak population from the mid-19th century onwards.\n\nIn 1652, the arrival of Europeans sparked the beginning of settler colonialism in South Africa. The Dutch East India Company was set up at the Cape, and imported large numbers of slaves from Africa and Asia during the mid-seventeenth century. The Dutch East India Company established a refreshment station for ships sailing between Europe and the east. The initial plan by Dutch East India Company officer Jan van Riebeeck was to maintain a small community around the new fort, but the community continued to spread and colonize further than originally planned. There was a historic struggle to achieve the intended British sovereignty that was achieved in other parts of the commonwealth. State sovereignty belonged to the Union of South Africa (1910-61), followed by the Republic of South Africa (1961-present day). As of 2014, the South African government has re-opened the period for land claims under the Restitution of Land Rights Amendment Act. \n\nFor decades, Saddam Hussein 'Arabized' northern Iraq, an act often referred as \"internal colonialism\". The policy of Saddam Hussein in North Iraq during the Ba'athist rule was described by Dr. Francis Kofi Abiew as a \"Colonial 'Arabization'\" program, including large-scale Kurdish deportations and forced Arab settlement in the region.\n\nFollowing the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe stated that the demographics of the island are continuously modified as a result of the deliberate policies of the Turks. Some suggest that over 120,000 Turkish settlers were brought to the island from mainland Turkey, in violation of article 49 of the Geneva convention. \nAccording to the UN resolution 1987/19, adopted on 2 September 1987, the UN expressed \"its concern also at the policy and practice of the implantation of settlers in the occupied territories of Cyprus, which constitute a form of colonialism and attempt to change illegally the demographic structure of Cyprus\".\n\nIn 1967 the French historian Maxime Rodinson wrote an article later translated and published in English as \"Israel: A Colonial Settler-State?\" Lorenzo Veracini describes Israel as a colonial state and writes that Jewish settlers could expel the British in 1948 only because they had their own colonial relationships inside and outside Israel's new borders. Veracini believes the possibility of an Israeli disengagement is always latent and this relationship could be severed, through an \"accommodation of a Palestinian Israeli autonomy within the institutions of the Israeli state\" (Veracini 2006) Other commentators, such as Daiva Stasiulis, Nira Yuval-Davis, and Joseph Massad in the \"Post Colonial Colony: time, space and bodies in Palestine/ Israel in the persistence of the Palestinian Question\" have included Israel in their global analysis of settler societies. Ilan Pappé describes Zionism and Israel in similar terms. Scholar Amal Jamal, from Tel Aviv University, has stated, \"Israel was created by a settler-colonial movement of Jewish immigrants\".\n\nSome Palestinians express similar opinions - writer and sociologist Jamil Hilal, member of the Palestinian National Council lives in what he describes as \"the heavily-colonised West Bank\", and drew parallels in 1976 between South African and Israeli settler colonialism, writes that \"as in Southern Africa, stretches of land were acquired by the Zionist settlers [...] and their Arab tenants thrown out\". Former Palestinian Foreign Minister Dr. Nasser al-Qidwa opposes the policy of Israeli settlements and has described those efforts as colonialism.\n\nAccording to a report by the FMEP issued in 2000, the settler population in the West Bank and Gaza strip grew from approximately 1,500 in 1972 to approximately 73,000 in 1989, and more than doubled that in 1998 to approximately 169,000. The report also describes demographics statistics indicating that, by place of birth, 78% of Israeli settlers in the West Bank and Gaza were from Europe or America, 19% from Israel. In January 2015 the Israeli Interior Ministry gave figures of 389,250 Israelis living in the West Bank and a further 375,000 Israelis living in East Jerusalem.\n\nA number of scholars have objected to the idea that Zionism and the State of Israel are tantamount to settler colonialism. Avi Bareli, in his essay 'Forgetting Europe: Perspectives on the Debate about Zionism and Colonialism', argues that the \"Colonialist School offered this alternative interpretation to replace the account of the return of the Jewish people to its land\". Moreover, he asserts that it \"ignores the economic, social, and cultural processes that spurred the Jews in Eastern Europe to emigrate to Palestine over decades in the twentieth century\". Arnon Golan contends that \"Zionism was not imperialist or colonialist in nature, but a national liberation movement that developed in eastern and central Europe, in conjunction with other national liberation movements in these regions\" and that \"Zionism was a diaspora national movement that aspired to promote its interests in the destined homeland through becoming a collaborator of imperial powers.\" S. Ilan Troen, in 'De-Judaizing the Homeland: Academic Politics in Rewriting the History of Palestine', argues that Zionism was the repatriation of a long displaced indigenous population to their historic homeland, and that \"Zionists did not see themselves as foreigners or conquerors, for centuries in the Diaspora they had been strangers\". Troen further argues that there are several differences between European colonialism and the Zionist movement, including that \"there is no New Vilna, New Bialystock, New Warsaw, New England, New York...and so on\" in Israel. He writes that \"mandates were intended to nurture the formation of new states until independence and this instrument was to be applied to Jews, even as it was for the Arab peoples of Syria and Iraq. In this view, Jews were a people not only entitled to a state but that polity was naturally located in a part of the world in which they had originated, had been resident since the ancient world, and still constituted a vital presence in many areas of the region, including Palestine\" and that \"perhaps the most manifest or visible evidence—for those who would be willing to acknowledge—were found in the revival of Hebrew into a living language; the marking the landscape with a Jewish identity; and the development of an indigenous culture with roots in the ancient past.\" He concludes that \"casting Zionists as colonizers serves to present them as occupiers in a land to which, by definition, they do not belong.\" Others such as Michael J. Cohen, and Bernard Avishai have similarly rebutted criticism of the State of Israel as a settler-colonial state.\n\n\n"}

Originally, a Slavist (from Russian \"славист\" or Polish \"slawista\") or Slavicist was primarily a linguist or philologist researching Slavistics, a Slavic (AmE) or Slavonic (BrE) scholar. Increasingly historians and other humanists and social scientists who study Slavic area cultures and societies have been included in this rubric.\n\nIn North America, Slavic studies are dominated by Russian studies; Ewa Thompson describes the situation of non-Russian Slavic studies as \"Invisible and Mute\".\n\nSlavistics emerged in late 18th and early 19th century, simultaneously with national revivals among various nations of Slavic origins and with ideological attempts to establish a common sense of Slavic community, exemplified by the Pan-Slavist movement. Among the first scholars to use the term was Josef Dobrovský (1753-1829).\n\nThe history of Slavic studies is generally divided into three periods. Until 1876 the early Slavists concentrated on documentation and printing of monuments of Slavic languages, among them the first texts written in national languages. At this time the majority of Slavic languages received their first modern dictionaries, grammars and compendia. The second period, ending with World War I, featured the rapid development of Slavic philology and linguistics, most notably outside of Slavic countries themselves, in the circle formed around August Schleicher (1821-1868) and around August Leskien (1840-1916) at the University of Leipzig.\n\nAfter World War I Slavic studies scholars focused on dialectology, while the science continued to develop in countries with large populations having Slavic origins. After World War II there developed centres of Slavic studies, and much greater expansion into other humanities and social science disciplines in various universities around the world. Indeed, partly due to the political concerns in Western European and the United States about the Slavic world nurtured by the Cold War, Slavic studies flourished in the years from World War II into the 1990s and remain strong, though university enrollments in Slavic languages have declined since the 1990s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4847318", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4847318", "title": "The Executioner (book series)", "text": "The Executioner (book series)\n\nThe Executioner is a monthly men's action-adventure series following the exploits of the character Mack Bolan and his wars against organized crime and international terrorism. The series spans #453 installments (as of December 2017) and has sold more than 200 million copies since its debut installment, \"War Against the Mafia\". The series was created and initially written by American author Don Pendleton, who penned 37 of the original 38 Bolan novels. In 1980, Pendleton licensed the rights to Gold Eagle and was succeeded by a collective of ghostwriters.\n\nSince its inception in 1969, The Executioner series has spawned several spin-off series including: Able Team, Phoenix Force, and Stony Man (the series into which Able Team and Phoenix Force were eventually merged). Every other month, the Executioner series is complimented by the release of a Super Bolan, whose titles are twice the length of a standard Executioner novel.\n\nMack Bolan is a Vietnam War veteran serving as a sniper. It is in these jungles where the young Bolan honed his military capabilities and his deadly accuracy. His 97 confirmed kills gave birth to the nickname he would carry for the rest of his life: The Executioner. Amidst the chaos of war, Bolan also earned the moniker \"Sergeant Mercy\", for his compassion and willingness to help innocent Vietnamese citizens put in harm's way or wounded by the conflict around them.\n\nDuring his tour of duty, Bolan was called home on emergency leave to bury his family, who were killed by their father, Sam Bolan, in a triple-murder/suicide. Upon his return home, Bolan learned loan sharks from a local branch of the \"Mafia\" \"family\" had forced his sister Cynthia into a life of prostitution to pay back the family debt. Upon learning the news, his father could not bear it and committed the horrendous act. Only Bolan's 14-year-old brother Johnny survived his wounds.\n\nBolan realized that the real enemy was not in the jungles of Vietnam, but at home. The Mafia's schemes affected everyday innocent civilians such as his own family. Using the tactics he learned during his military combat, Bolan refused to return to Vietnam and instead took his war to the Mafia. City by city, he strikes ruthlessly to bring down the mafia and to clean the country of this horrific criminal organization. His actions would \ndivide opinions. Some government and law enforcement officials were pleased with his efforts, while some sought to bring his war to an end.\n\nIn the end, the government offered Bolan amnesty under the condition he work for them. Bolan accepted and emerged under the name Colonel John Phoenix beginning his war against terrorism and the KGB. Bolan works in conjunction with Hal Brognola, the Director of the Sensitive Operations Group and the liaison between Bolan and the Oval Office. Phoenix was chosen to be Bolan's new alias in reference to the mythological bird that would resurrect itself from the ashes of a former life, just as Bolan had done after the events of Executioner #38, Satan's Sabbath.\n\nIn the Mack Bolan universe there are two covert tactical neutralization teams assigned to Stony Man but which work separately from it: Able Team and Phoenix Force. Each had its own series of books until 1991, when Gold Eagle combined both series into one, Stony Man. In addition, the SuperBolan series emerged in 1985. These books are double the size of a regular Executioner title and are released every other month.\n\nIn France, a new spin-off series, Kira B., featuring Mack Bolan's \"daughter\" Kira, was introduced by the publisher Vauvenargues, in 2012. Written under the pen name Steven Belly, the series follows the adventures of Kira, a young woman who appeared in \"L'Exécuteur nº300: Le réseau Phénix\", where she manipulated Mack Bolan to come out of retirement to fight against cyber-criminals. Since then, she has helped her \"father\" in his fight against crime and now is the heroine of her own, eponymous series.\n\nIn 1975, Leonard J. Ackerman Productions produced \"Don Pendleton's The Executioner Mystery Magazine\", a digest-sized, pulp magazine anthology series along the same lines as the \"Alfred Hitchcock Mystery Magazine\". The magazine had little connection to the Mack Bolan books save for the occasional story related to the Mafia. The magazine ran for only four issues, ending in August 1975, with the final issue titled simply \"The Executioner Mystery Magazine\".\n\nJoseph E. Levine contracted Richard Maibaum in 1972 to write a screenplay, based on the fifth and sixth volumes, \"Continental Contract\" and \"Assault on Soho\". A later attempt to adapt \"The Executioner\" to the screen by Burt Reynolds was to star Sylvester Stallone and Cynthia Rothrock, but the production was scrapped.\n\nIt was announced August 2014, that Shane Salerno, Hollywood producer, screenwriter has acquired the Executioner Mack Bolan Series of action/adventure novels for a film franchise.\n\nDeadline reports that Warner Bros. has acquired the film rights of the Book series with Bradley Cooper starring as Bolan, Shane Salerno writing and Todd Phillips directing.\n\n\"The Executioner: War Against the Mafia\" was a comic book adaptation of the first novel by Don Pendleton and Linda Pendleton, published 1993 by Innovation Comics. Intended to run four issues, the final instalment was not published due to Innovation closing. Artwork was by Sandu Florea.\n\n\"The Executioner: Death Squad\" was adapted by Linda Pendleton with art by Sandu Florea. It was a 128-page black and white comic, published in 1996 by Vivid Comics.\n\n\"The Executioner\" was adapted into a five-part comic book series by IDW, written by Doug Wojtowicz and illustrated by S. I. Gallant. It was reissued as the graphic novel, \"Don Pendleton's The Executioner: The Devil's Tool\", in November 2008. The reissued version contained an introduction by Linda Pendleton, \"Don Pendleton's Creation of Mack Bolan, The Executioner\".\n\nThe Executioner is often cited as the inspiration for the Marvel Comics character The Punisher, who also fights the Mafia, as well as James Glickenhaus' films \"The Exterminator\" (1980) and \"Exterminator 2\" (1984).\n\n\"See: List of authors in the Executioner series.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3232376", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3232376", "title": "Trash-talk", "text": "Trash-talk\n\nTrash-talk is a form of insult usually found in sports events, although it is not exclusive to just sports or similarly characterized events. It is often used to intimidate the opposition, but can also be used in a humorous spirit. Trash-talk is often characterized by use of hyperbole or figurative language, such as, \"Your team can't run! You run like honey on ice!\" Puns and other wordplay are commonly used.\n\nTrash-talk was commonly used by the heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali in the 1960s and 70s. In 1963, Ali even released a popular full-length record album consisting largely of trash-talk poetry. It was entitled \"I Am the Greatest!\", a phrase that became his signature line. Since then, it has become common for boxers, wrestlers, and many other sports competitors to use trash-talk. However, in amateur sports ranks, trash talking is generally frowned upon as unsportsmanlike conduct (especially in youth leagues). UFC Lightweight Champion Conor McGregor is a more recent example of a prominent trash-talker, while former UFC fighter Chael Sonnen is considered by some to be the greatest trash talker in UFC history. Although the practice of trying to distract opponents by verbal abuse is common to virtually all sports, other sports sometimes have their own terminology for verbal abuse: for example, cricket calls it sledging and in ice hockey it is called chirping. Down Gaelic footballer Brendan Coulter has admitted to being targeted by sledging while on the field of play. The Wealdstone Raider, a notorious fan hailing from Wealdstone, is known for trash-talking the opposition and opposition's fans.\n\nSmack talk is a slang term seen in chat channels in chat room, blog, and massively multiplayer online game (MMOG) conversations. The term came about in the early 1990s. It generally refers to the use of threatening or intentionally inflammatory language. Smack talk can also be used with bullying, whether that be face-to-face interaction, or cyber-bullying.\n\nSmack talk is also a slang term used in sports. It refers to inflammatory comments made by a person or team in order to insult, anger, annoy or be boisterous towards your opponents. Although it began as a term used by sports fans and athletes, it has spread to all areas of culture where competition takes place. In the United States, it is synonymous with \"trash talk\".\n\nThe social interaction within MMOGs has been observed to be quite active and often leads to long-term social relationships. MMOG groups, such as \"teams\", \"guilds\" or \"corporations\", are composed of groups of people who often initially have no other social contact or interactions with each other. As a result, their conversations contain a subtext of discovery of language skills, social values, and intentions.

{"id": "319304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=319304", "title": "Unicron", "text": "Unicron\n\nUnicron is a fictional character from the many continuities in the \"Transformers\" universe and toyline. Created by Floro Dery, he was introduced in the 1986 animated film \"\" and has since reappeared in \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\" and Atari's 2004 \"Transformers\" video game. Unicron is a prodigiously large robot whose scale reaches planetary proportions, and he is also able to transform into a mechanical planet. Unicron's origin has expanded over the years from simply being a large robot to being a god of chaos who devours realities. He often employs the help of Decepticons in his work, and in some stories is considered part of the origin of the Decepticon forces.\n\nAccording to the Transformers lore, before the dawn of time, Order and Chaos exist within an extra-dimensional entity known as The One. To explore the fledgling universe, he creates the astral being known as Unicron, and then subdivides him, creating his twin, Primus. Both brothers are multiversal singularities, unique in all realities, but whereas Unicron can only exist in one universe at a time, moving freely between them at will, Primus exists simultaneously in all realities at once.\n\nAs Unicron and Primus venture through the cosmos, it becomes apparent to Primus that Unicron is nothing but a purely corrupt being, and so confronts the threat his sibling poses. In combat, Primus is no match for Unicron; in cunning, he proves himself to be his brother's superior when he shifts their battle to the astral plane, and then back to the physical world, sacrificing most of his strength to manifest their essences within metallic planetoids and leaving them both trapped in the planet prison. Primus hopes to contain the evil force forever. Unfortunately, over time, Unicron learns to physically shape his prison into a giant metallic planet, and Primus emulates his brother. The Primus planet becomes the mechanical world of Cybertron. When Unicron learns to transform his planetary form even further, into a gigantic robot form, Primus adapts the idea, and creates The Thirteen, a group of robotic beings that possessed the ability to change shape.\n\nThe war between Unicron and Primus comes to its seeming end during a climactic battle in which one of the Thirteen, Megatronus Prime, who is afterwards known as The Fallen, betrays Primus and becomes an acolyte of Unicron. The battle ends when the Fallen and Unicron are sucked into a black hole and disappear. With Unicron gone, Primus enters an eons-long slumber, preventing Unicron from detecting him through the mental link the brothers share.\n\nThe Primus/Unicron backstory has evolved and been rewritten a number of times since it originated in the Marvel Comics series. The version recounted above is the current iteration, which has slowly solidified across a wide swath of media (beginning around the time of \"\"). Before the Primus/Unicron mythos reached its present form, it went through several distinct versions in the Marvel Generation 1 comics and elsewhere.\n\nThe first time the Primus/Unicron backstory appears is in the UK comic continuity, in the story \"The Legacy of Unicron!\", when Unicron recounts it to Death's Head. Per Unicron's telling of events, he was a primal force of evil at the dawn of the universe, who led a legion of Dark Gods against his mortal foe, Primus, Lord of the Light Gods. Events proceed to play out basically as described above, though the role of the Light and Dark Gods diminishes with each subsequent retelling of the story, until the current version, in which Primus and Unicron are alone, and have a unique origin.\n\nThe story is told a second time in the United States book by the Keeper, an ancient mechanoid who guarded Primus's head at the center of Cybertron. This telling is effectively the same as the UK story, but mentions that the battle of Primus and Unicron was towards the end of the era of gods, that Primus and Unicron were the last of their respective pantheons, and Primus has to defeat Unicron before he can take his place with the other gods in the \"Omniversal Matrix\".\n\nThe story is told a third time in the United States Marvel series by Primus, when he gathers all his children together to prepare for Unicron's coming. In this telling, Unicron predates the current universe, and destroyed the previous universe. He slept peacefully, alone in the void of un-creation that remained, until fragments of the old universe that he had overlooked reacted, causing the Big Bang and birthing the current universe. The \"sentient core\" of this new universe recognizes the threat that Unicron poses, and so creates Primus to counter his evil and be guardian of the new creation.\n\nThe first modern retelling of the origins of Primus and Unicron comes from a set of \"\" trading cards released by Fleer. The backstory printed on Unicron's card introduces the concept of two brothers created to explore the new universe by an extra-dimensional entity named the \"Allspark\".\"\n\nThis is subsequently expanded on and combined with aspects of the various Marvel Comics stories in \"\", published by Dorling Kindersley and written by Simon Furman, who had written all three prior tellings. Here, the entity Fleer had called the \"Allspark\" is redubbed \"The One\", and the modern iteration of the myth detailed above is firmly established, and forms the backbone of subsequent fiction such as \"\" and Fun Publications' \"\" comics.\n\nAlthough many of the official television and comic appearances of Unicron appear to present separate and distinct incarnations of the character, some writers have presented an interpretation of the sources that tie all the versions of Unicron together into a single continuity. Likewise, Primus is a \"multiversal singularity\", but while Unicron is limited in this ability, and can only exist in one reality at a time, travelling between them, Primus co-exists in all realities simultaneously.\n\nThis concept began with the release of a series of \"Transformers: Armada\" trading cards by Fleer. The biography printed on Unicron's card presents him as one of two heralds created by the Allspark to explore the newly birthed universe. Inspired by his Marvel Comics origin, the other herald is Primus, and the brothers set about this task, until they come upon a region of space teeming with pure Energon. Unicron wants the power for himself, and cuts Primus down before he can report it to the Allspark, casting his brother's body into the orbit of a nearby star. Unicron goes on to become the engine of destruction that menaces the universe.\n\nThe publication of \"Transformers: The Ultimate Guide\" by Dorling Kindersley cemented this notion. Writer Simon Furman incorporated the various aspects of the Dreamwave comics story, some elements of the Fleer storyline, and his original Marvel Comics origin to create what is now essentially the \"definitive\" origin for Unicron. In this version of events, Unicron and Primus are again twin heralds, giant metal planetoids created by the \"One\", who are sent to explore the universe. Unicron is an imperfect being and turns to evil, adapting his form to transform into a giant robot. To battle him, The One gives Primus this power as well, but Primus opts to remain in planet mode. He passes the transforming abilities on to thirteen robots he creates, the first Transformers. One of the thirteen turns on Primus and sides with Unicron, and the war culminates in a battle that sees Unicron and this traitor, the \"Fallen\", sucked through a black hole into another universe.\n\nThis new origin is part of the G1 timeline laid down by the Ultimate Guide, which is apparently being taken as the \"official\" G1 timeline for future projects that require it. This means there is only one Unicron who travels from universe to universe across all the assorted \"Transformers\" continuities. This interpretation of the character is evidenced by the parallel universe spanning \"\" toyline and convention-exclusive comic books — in which the singular Unicron captured Transformers from various alternate realities and pitted them against each other, feeding off the energies released — and the \"Transformers: Cybertron\" comic strip in the Transformers Collectors' Club fan magazine, which depicts Unicron's actions in the various realities in a chronological order and claims that Cybertron is the stable heart of the Multiverse.\n\nUnicron's size is never specified in any canon materials, aside from the vague term \"planet size\". In \"The Transformers: The Movie\", Unicron's height appears to be anywhere from several kilometers (as when handling Galvatron) to several hundred kilometers (as when attacking and destroying Lithone and Cybertron's moons, and attacking Cybertron). A planet-mode diameter of has been suggested and robot-mode dimensions can follow from that estimate, provided that there is no change in size (compression or expansion) common among so many Transformers. One scene in the movie shows Jazz driving out of one of Unicron's eyes, just small enough to fit through them, though in another scene the Quintesson ship Hot Rod arrived in is tiny compared with the eye. Unicron is also small enough to stand on Cybertron's surface. In season 3, it is shown that the eyes from Metroplex and Trypticon (both city-sized Transformers) are the perfect size to use as replacement parts when Unicron orders the ghost of Starscream to steal them. However, later in the episode when Trypticon moves Unicron's head, the head is larger than Trypticon's entire body. (Note: However, the eyes could be only small components for his Optic Sensors to be reformed and/ or completed.) In the storyline \"The Ultimate Doom\", Cybertron appears to be smaller than Earth's own moon (and by extension, this would indicate Lithone would be too small to be a planet), making Unicron's dimensions in the cartoon harder to define.\n\nThe comic version of Unicron may be far larger. In the first issue of Marvel Comics Generation One \"Transformers\" comic, Cybertron is said to be around the size of Saturn (which has a diameter of roughly at the equator). As Unicron's planet mode is seen to be about a quarter the size of Cybertron in the comics, this suggests a diameter of 30,000+ km. The Dreamwave equivalent of Unicron may be the same size, as the Cybertron of the Dreamwave universe is said to be the size of Saturn.\n\nIn the \"Transformers: Cybertron\" comics, the tank version of Unicron is only the same size as an average Transformer, and is shorter than the Autobots Sentinel Maximus and Omega Prime, whom he fought.\n\nThe \"Transformers Prime\" iteration of Unicron depicts his physical manifestation as the Earth itself, with his consciousness held within the core, making him a planet with sustainable life, though it has not been seen if Unicron wishes to consume other planets like his other incarnations.\n\nThe character Unicron first appears in the opening scene of 1986's \"\", immediately making clear his goal by consuming the small world of Lithone. Subsequently, when the Decepticons Megatron, Skywarp, Thundercracker, and the Insecticons are set adrift in space and left to die following a furious battle with the Autobots, Unicron appears before them and offers Megatron a deal: in exchange for a new body, and new troops, Megatron will destroy the Autobot Matrix of Leadership, the only thing that can stand in Unicron's way. Thus, Unicron rebuilds Megatron into a new and more powerful body, and rechristens him to Galvatron. He then uses the battered bodies of the other Decepticons and creates Scourge, the tracker, from Thundercracker and his huntsmen, the Sweeps, from Kickback and Shrapnel. Cyclonus, the warrior is then created, from Bombshell and Skywarp (two Cyclonus' are shown, which is an animation error, as later throughout the movie and the TV series Cyclonus is only one character). After that, Unicron also gives Galvatron a vessel, and Galvatron begins to carry out his assigned task, although he is loath to do so. When Galvatron shows any signs of opposition to Unicron's will, Unicron inflicts agonizing torture in his mind to coerce him into obedience.\n\nFollowing Unicron's consumption of Cybertron's two moons, Galvatron obtains the Matrix from Ultra Magnus, believing he can use it to bring Unicron under his control. Attempting to open the Matrix to intimidate Unicron, Galvatron only prompts his transformation into robot mode, and is swallowed by the planet-eater. Unicron lays waste to Cybertron, halted briefly when the young Autobot rookie, Hot Rod, crashes a Quintesson spacecraft through his eye. Finding Hot Rod inside Unicron's body, Galvatron suggests an alliance against their common enemy. However, Unicron inflicts his mental torture upon Galvatron, forcing him to fight Hot Rod. Hot Rod takes the Matrix from Galvatron during the battle, and becomes Rodimus Prime. Rodimus throws Galvatron into space, freeing him from Unicron's mind-control. Rodimus opens the Matrix within Unicron, destroying his body, leaving only his head, which becomes a moon of Cybertron. As Unicron's head drifts around in space the movie ends, with the credits shown in a background of his head floating in space.\n\nIn \"\", Unicron was voiced by Orson Welles. Unicron proved to be Welles's final role, as he died a few days after completing work on the project; rumors persist that Welles did not complete recording of all his lines, and that Leonard Nimoy filled in for him, but the film's voice director Wally Burr and actress Susan Blu refute the claim. There were two early attempts to produce Unicron toys for the \"Transformers\" toyline, featuring voice clips from Welles himself, but the results never made it to production. It was not until 2003 that a production Unicron toy was made. For the 20th anniversary of the original movie, Diamond Select released an eight and a half inch tall statue of Unicron and Rodimus Prime.\n\nThe third season of \"The Transformers\" animated series continues Unicron's story where the movie left off, as the planet-eater's deactivated head settles into orbit around Cybertron. His head is visited by Cyclonus, who accesses the memory bank to discern the fate of Galvatron. Later, the ghost of the deceased Decepticon Starscream reactivates Unicron's head and enters into a bargain with him, performing three labors in exchange for the restoration of his body. Starscream (inhabiting and controlling Scourge's body) gathers for Unicron Metroplex's eyes (breaking one and replacing it with one from Trypticon) and Trypticon's transformation cog. He begins to connect his head to Cybertron, which would become Unicron's new body. Starscream demands that Unicron restore his own body so that he can complete the required connections. Once Unicron does so, Starscream double-crosses him, and refuses to finish the job. Unicron's head is subsequently blown off into space by an explosion instigated by the Autobots.\n\nLater, when searching for a new supply of positrons (anti-electrons), the Decepticons venture to Unicron's head, where Cyclonus and Scourge accidentally awake the slumbering demi-god. At the same time, Grimlock constructs from pieces of Unicron's head the Technobots, and one of their number, Strafe, severs enough of Unicron's neural connections to shut him back down.\n\nAlthough Unicron himself does not appear again, his origin in the animated series is later revealed. Unicron was created near the beginning of the universe by the diminutive genius known as Primacron, who intended for him to devour all life in the universe, leaving a blank slate that Primacron could use as he saw fit. However, Unicron turned upon Primacron, deciding that \"he\" would rule the universe and subsequently setting out to achieve that goal.\n\nUnicron's head is seen one last time as Primacron's new creation cripples Cybertron. This time the head looks very old and almost stone-like, underlining that Unicron is finally dead.\n\nWhen the \"Generation 2\" animated series aired, animated bits of the film with Unicron in it were edited into the episode \"More Than Meets The Eye Part 1\".\n\nAlthough the real Unicron did not make any appearances in 1996's CGI animated series, \"Beast Wars\", he is mentioned. Starscream's ghost spins a lie that Unicron had destroyed him (Unicron's planet mode is seen in Starscream's fabricated flashback), and when the mysterious alien race known as the Vok directly communicates with Maximal leader Optimus Primal, they search his mind for an image that he would fear and respect, find Unicron, and take the form of his head. Later, in Season 3 of \"Beast Wars\", Tarantulas attempts to destroy both Autobots and Decepticons in the \"Ark\", as he and the Tripredacus Council are descended from a different lineage than Autobot or Decepticon, and would hence inherit Cybertron all to themselves. Although never directly stated, it is implied that the ancestor of Tarantulas and the Council is Unicron; Megatron refers to Tarantulas as \"Unicron's spawn\" in the \"Beast Wars\" episode \"Nemesis Part 1\".\n\nIn Episode 16 of \"Beast Machines\", Rattrap calls Megatron's floating head a tribute to Unicron.\n\nConversely, Unicron played a large role in the two Japanese-exclusive animated \"Beast Wars\" series, \"Beast Wars II\" and \"Beast Wars Neo\". Following the events of \"The Transformers: The Movie\" and Unicron's demise, the Angolmois energy that gave Unicron life are left sealed within planet Gaia (a future version of Earth). When the war on this planet between the forces of Maximal leader Lio Convoy and Predacon leader Galvatron (a different individual bearing the same name as Unicron's original creation) culminates in the explosion of Galvatron's Nemesis battle fortress, the resultant energy surge revives Unicron's consciousness. Seeking to complete his resurrection, he creates the Blendtrons to gather the Angolmois Capsules his life-energy is sealed in, and then proceeds to possess the lifeless body of Galvatron as a temporary host. After gathering the capsules, Unicron attempts to make Cybertron his new body, but is defeated by Maximal commander Big Convoy.\n\nAs with his original incarnation, there was a failed attempt to make Unicron into a toy for the \"Beast Wars Neo\" line, and although regarded as quite impressive, the prototype - which, notably, does not resemble Unicron from the associated series at all - did not make it to production.\n\nAlthough Unicron plays a major role in the above-mentioned Japanese series, he had not been featured as a major player in American fiction for over a decade. The advent of the three co-produced series \"\", \"\" and \"\" reintroduced Unicron to American audiences and finally rendered him in toy form, with the Mini-Con partner Dead End. In reference to Unicron's key role in these three series, Hasbro's head of Transformers, Aaron Archer, has collectively dubbed them \"The Unicron Trilogy\".\n\nThis incarnation of Unicron is not shown to physically consume planets in the same manner as his G1 predecessor, only to blast and absorb the remains. During his battle with Optimus Supreme, who has grown to Unicron's size, Unicron demonstrates that he has enough power to simply destroy a planet completely without consuming it, but several references are made to consumption, so he may indeed perform the action. In one of the mini-comic books packed in with the later Armada toys, Unicron is illustrated literally eating an asteroid or moon whole. This Unicron was voiced by Mark Acheson in the U.S., and by Katsumi Chō in Japan.\n\nA primal force of evil from the beginning of time, his origins lost to history, the \"Armada\" universe's incarnation of Unicron is the embodiment of the darkness and hate in the hearts of all beings. Defeated by the Autobot warrior Omega Supreme at some time in the ancient past of Cybertron, Unicron hides himself in plain sight of the Transformers, disguised as the planet's moon. In order to re-energise himself, Unicron implants some of his own cells within Cybertron, where they grow and \"hatch\", giving birth to the diminutive race of robots called the Mini-Cons. Unicron intends them to increase the ferocity of the Autobot/Decepticon war, allowing Unicron to feed off the hatred. As a result of interference by human children, displaced in time from the 21st century, the Mini-Cons develop sentience and flee Cybertron, crashing on Earth where they lay dormant for a million years.\n\nThe subsequent awakening of the Mini-Cons increases the pace of the war, and to hasten the proceeding, Unicron creates another being from his own body, Sideways. Sideways serves as Unicron's agent to manipulate the events on Earth to keep the balance of power shifting and the ferocity of both sides increasing. At the culmination of his plan, the Decepticons come into possession of all three Mini-Con weapons - the Star Saber, the Skyboom Shield and the Requiem Blaster - which Sideways and Thrust steal and use to reactivate Unicron.\n\nUnicron transforms to robot mode and turns on Cybertron as the combined Autobot/Decepticon armada attempt in vain to stop him. Optimus Prime and Megatron (now Galvatron) enter his body with the human children, and Unicron addresses them through Sideways's form. He absorbs all but Optimus into his collective consciousness and brings the Mini-Cons back under his control. However, from within Unicron's mind, Rad is able to use his connection to High Wire to restore the Mini-Cons' individual minds, freeing the weapons and deactivating Unicron. With the danger apparently over, Galvatron challenges Prime to a final battle, but the hatred between the foes stirs Unicron to life again, and upon realizing this, Galvatron decides to sacrifice himself to ensure there will be no more hatred. Plunging into Unicron's maw and allowing Optimus to escape alive, Galvatron ends the hatred. In a mighty flash, Unicron vanishes without a trace, although at the end of the series he is shown orbiting an unknown planet.\n\nUnicron's body is inactive and badly damaged from his previous battle. Ten years after Galvatron's sacrifice a former victim of Unicron chooses to strike. Within Unicron's shell, the Spark of Alpha Q, ruler of Planet Q, which Unicron had consumed in the past, still exists. From Unicron's body he creates the Terrorcons to gather Energon, which he intends to use to regenerate all the worlds Unicron devoured. However, Megatron's corpse and Spark remain within Unicron, and slowly siphon off some of the gathered Energon, allowing him to be reborn in a new body through the unintentional actions of Scorponok. Hunted by Megatron, Alpha-Q then jettisons Unicron's head and escapes in it. Megatron takes over Unicron's body and continues to gather Energon in order to rebuild Unicron to use as a weapon. A joint attack by Alpha-Q, the Autobots, and their human allies sees all of Earth's Energon channeled into Unicron's head, which Alpha-Q then rams into Unicron's body. The positively charged Energon of Earth reacts with the negatively charged Energon running through Unicron. It tears open a fissure in reality leading to a new area of space where planets Unicron consumed are recreated and sustained through the Energon radiated from Unicron's head, which is now a glowing red sun.\n\nUnicron's body, damaged once more, lies in the dark reaches near the fissure. The Decepticons raid Alpha-Q's new planets for the Energon necessary to revive Unicron again. Megatron directs Unicron's body to retrieve his head, extinguishing the Energon Sun and killing Alpha-Q in the process. Unicron begins to take over Megatron's body. Unicron's body is destroyed in battle by Optimus Supreme with the help of some of the other Autobots. Unbeknownst to anyone, Unicron lives on in two forms: his minuscule Spark, and his consciousness, which lies buried in Megatron's mind. With subconscious nudgings, Unicron leads Megatron to a large reservoir of \"Super Energon\" beneath Cybertron's surface, which transforms him into Galvatron. After a series of failed battles, Galvatron exposes himself to the Super Energon once again, and grows to a gigantic height. Unicron seizes control of his body as a new vessel and sets out to rejoin with his Spark, but a Primus-empowered Optimus Supreme engages him in battle again, and draws all of Unicron's consciousness out of Galvatron and seals it within his own Spark. Enraged, Galvatron prepares to destroy Unicron's Spark, but it merges with him, enlarging him again. He battles again with Optimus Supreme, this time bolstered by the combined energy of all his troops' Sparks. Meanwhile, Primus merges with the Super Energon, creating a fledgling sun which arrives at the site of the battle. Taking control of his body for a brief moment, Galvatron sacrifices himself to stop Unicron, plunging into the infant sun, which ignites and gives new life to Alpha-Q's worlds.\n\nWith Unicron's destruction in \"Energon\", the collapse of his body results in the creation of an enormous black hole which, if left unchecked, will consume and destroy everything. The Autobots must find the Omega Lock and the Cyber Planet Keys to save Cybertron and the universe. Later, the \"Cybertron\" Transformers learn from Primus that destroying Unicron results in an imbalance between good (Primus, who still exists) and evil (Unicron, who is gone); this imbalance factored into the creation of the black hole, known as the Unicron Singularity in American fiction or the Grand Black Hole in Japan. His scattered pieces are absorbed by Megatron giving Megatron dark powers and causing him to look like Unicron.\n\nThe Japanese equivalent, \"Galaxy Force\", makes several scattered references to Unicron, as the Japanese producers for the series decided not to have \"Galaxy Force\" follow the events of \"Micron Legend\" (the Japanese equivalent of \"Armada\") and \"Super Link\" (the Japanese equivalent of \"Energon\").\n\nThe Unicron toy in the \"Cybertron\" series is the size of a deluxe class Transformer toy and transforms into a Cybertronian tank instead of a planet. This portrayal of Unicron is consistent with his appearance in the \"Cybertron\" strip in the Hasbro Club Collector's comic where he is portrayed at around the same size as his foes Sentinel Maximus and Omega Prime.\n\nIn the \"\" storyline, Unicron (voiced by John Noble) is the source of Dark Energon, a form of Energon with the ability to revive the dead - albeit in a mindless, zombie-like \"Terrorcon\" state - also known by the name \"the blood of Unicron\". Unicron is believed to represent the Anti-Spark (most likely a counterpart of the Allspark). As Optimus Prime relates, Primus and the original Thirteen Primes defeated Unicron and sent his body beyond Cybertron's orbit. As the Chaos Bringer drifted through space, he attracted space debris around himself that coalesced into Planet Earth, rich with Dark Energon. The gravitational pull of an astrological alignment awakens Unicron from his slumber, as Earth's weather patterns go out of control. Having transcended physical form, Unicron berates Megatron for thinking of being his servant.\n\nSensing Optimus Prime and the Matrix of Leadership, Unicron resolves to finish the Autobot leader himself. He creates golem incarnations of himself to kill the Autobot. Though Optimus Prime pleas for the humans who evolved on Earth, Unicron dismisses them as parasites with the intent to slaughter them, once he finishes with Optimus Prime. Though the Autobots come to Optimus Prime's aid, Megatron destroys the last golem, refusing to allow anyone else to kill Optimus Prime. He sides with the Autobots and guides them to the Earth's core to stop Unicron before he completely awakens. Despite using his anti-bodies and possessing Megatron's body to hinder him and the other Autobots, Optimus Prime uses the Matrix of Leadership to deactivate Unicron without destroying the Earth, though he loses his memory of being a Prime until the Autobots restore it.\n\nThe awakening of Unicron from within the Earth draws the attention of Lio Convoy in another dimension. Travelling across realities, he arrives to find that the Autobots and Decepticons have already defeated Unicron, but elects to remain for a time to safeguard against his potential return. Using his ancient sword and the power of his \"Energon Matrix\", Lio Convoy carves up the remains of one of Unicron's rock-and-stone avatars to create the \"Gaia Armor\", severing its link to Unicron but allowing it to retain the power of Dark Energon.\n\nUnicron returns in the series finale movie \"\". When Optimus Prime restores the spirit of Primus, Unicron senses it and reawakens, this time in energy form. He confronts Megatron, saying that because of the Dark Energon within him, Megatron cannot become one with the Allspark. Therefore, he will become Unicron's vessel, and serve him in order to destroy Cybertron. Unicron brings Megatron back to life and upgrades his form, using it to travel through hyperspace toward Cybertron. Upon arriving, he confronts Bumblebee, Arcee, Bulkhead, and Smokescreen, nearly killing them using his Dark Energon weapons. Megatron starts to question Unicron's motives of destroying Cybertron, but Unicron psychically tortures him to keep him at bay. After their escape, Unicron comes across Predaking, who, upon recognizing Megatron's body, viciously attacks Unicron in beast mode. Unicron proves to be stronger than Predaking and knocks him unconscious. He reads his mind, finding that Predacon remains will make a perfect legion for his destruction of Cybertron and Primus.\n\nUnicron proceeds to a Predacon boneyard, defeating Predacons Skylynx and Darksteel in battle and bringing hundreds of deceased Predacons back to life as Terrorcons. He leads his new army to Cybertron's Well of All Sparks, and engages the Autobots, Decepticons, and Predacons in battle. He confronts Optimus Prime when he senses the Allspark. He fights him on even terms until he strikes Optimus down when Optimus makes a grab for the Allspark's container as Bumblebee holds Unicron down. Escaping Bumblebee, Unicron flies after Optimus and opens the container. He realizes too late that it is a trick, and his energy form is sucked into the container, freeing Megatron from his control and defeating Unicron. His legions of undead Predacons are destroyed. It turns out that Optimus had stored the Allspark in the Matrix of Leadership and would soon take the Matrix into the Well, sacrificing himself to ensure the return of Cybertronian life. Now understanding oppression, Megatron relinquishes his hatred and his lust for conquest, leaving for parts unknown to start anew.\n\nUnicron reappears in the sequel series, \"\", set five years after the events of \"Predacons Rising\". Although the majority of Unicron's anti-spark were safely imprisoned in the Allspark container, a remnant of the anti-spark still exists with Unicron's original body at the Earth's core. When Megatronus is freed and brought to Earth, he uses a spark-merging staff to extract the remnant from beneath the Earth, intending to merge the anti-spark and the Allspark together to destroy both Earth and Cybertron. When the staff is broken before it can fully draw in the Allspark, the anti-spark remnant returns to the Earth's core.\n\nIn the \"\" (set in the same continuity as \"Prime\") episode \"Christmas in July\", Heatwave tells Boulder that his throwing skills are insufficient to hit the backside of Unicron. Optimus Prime later references Unicron when the Burns discover a prehistoric island underneath Griffin Rock, telling them \"there are many things beneath the Earth's surface humans are not aware of\".\n\nIn the comics, Unicron is a fallen god from before the universe existed who seeks the ultimate peace granted by the destruction of all life. Unicron accomplishes this, wiping out everything in the universe and leaving only nothingness and void. His lust for destruction sated, Unicron enters a deep sleep, but he had not been thorough enough. Tiny fragments of the old universe react with each other, and a new universe is born. As Unicron sleeps, the core of this new universe - somehow a sentient being - becomes aware of Unicron's threat and creates a defender to battle his evil - Primus, the lord of light. Unicron awakes to find himself surrounded by another universe, and begins to destroy it again.\n\nHe and Primus clash many times, the force of their battles wiping out the very life Primus had been created to protect. To stop the destruction, Primus shifts the battle to the astral plane. In shifting the battle back to the physical universe without time to properly generate their energy forms, Primus entraps both himself and Unicron in two barren asteroids. Over the eons, Unicron learns to psionically shape his asteroid, and transforms it into a metallic planet, and then into a gargantuan robot. Primus, fearing that following suit by forming himself in a similar manner will simply pick up the conflict where it had left off, seeks an alternative way to defend the universe against the threat of Unicron by turning his asteroid into Cybertron. He populates it with robotic beings that, like Unicron, can alter their forms, giving rise to the transformers.\n\nUnicron's slightly convoluted comic tenure began in the United Kingdom's exclusive \"Transformers\" comic series, which splices its own stories with reprinted American material. Writer Simon Furman worked elements of the movie into his stories, creating a future universe based on the movie's events, but different from the cartoon. In the first use of this timeline, in the mega-serial, \"\", Galvatron travels back in time in an attempt to escape the control of Unicron. Unicron is able to ensnare the minds of three Autobots - Hot Rod, Kup and Blurr - and sends them back in time after him to foil his plot. Though Unicron's role in the story itself was minor, it offered the first glimpse of his greater mental power.\n\nIn the UK comics' version of post-movie events, Unicron's head does not enter Cybertron's orbit, and instead crashlands on the Planet of Junk. Still active, Unicron uses his mental powers to enslave the minds of the Junkion natives, who set about rebuilding his body. Cyclonus, Scourge, and the freelance peacekeeping agent, Death's Head, fall prey to him. He uses them to exacerbate the stalemated war on Cybertron to keep the Autobots busy, so that they will not learn of his impending resurrection. When Death's Head fights back against Unicron's mental control, Unicron rewards his temerity by revealing the comic book version of his origin. Death's Head then aids Rodimus Prime, projecting his mind into Unicron's where they battle, until Unicron's head is destroyed by explosives, and his essence sealed within the Matrix. Rodimus and several other future Autobots subsequently travel back in time to 1989 and participate in the \"Time Wars\". When they attempt to return to their own time afterward, they discover that disruptions to the timestream have erased their future, and replaced it with one where the Decepticons rule Cybertron. In this future, Unicron's essence emerges from the Matrix and briefly takes over Rodimus Prime, before he is thwarted by the removal of the Matrix from Rodimus's body. In 2010, however, Unicron attempted this again and succeeded, controlling Rodimus's body and reshaping it into his own image, before being defeated by Rodimus's own force of will.\n\nIn 1987, Simon Furman began writing the U.S. \"Transformers\" series in addition to the UK comics, and set in motion an epic Unicron-themed story. Unicron makes his presence known to the Transformers much earlier than 2005.\n\nA battle between the Autobot Classic Pretenders and the Decepticons' Mayhem Attack Squad at the centre of Cybertron has the side effect of waking the slumbering Primus, who is struck by a stray laser blast and awakes with a scream. Although he immediately sinks back into slumber, his scream echoes throughout the universe and Unicron hears it. Now aware of his enemy's location, Unicron heads towards Cybertron, but, seeking a herald to sow chaos in his name ahead of his coming, uses his formidable powers to send three agents - Hook, Line and Sinker, forward in time to an alternate future version of 2009. In this timeline, Unicron succeeds in consuming Cybertron in the year 2005, and Galvatron and the Decepticons rule Earth. This timeline's version of Galvatron is pulled back to 1990 by Hook, Line and Sinker and press-ganged into Unicron's service, but, like his predecessors, turns on his master by forcing Emirate Xaaron to awaken Primus in hopes of destroying Unicron. Primus possesses Xaaron and attempts to hold off Unicron, but he is weak, and his attack a ruse, leading to his own destruction. This, along with a direct attack by Galvatron, succeeds in galvanising the Autobots and Decepticons to attack Unicron together. They do little damage and many Transformers die before Optimus Prime is able use the Matrix to destroy Unicron, exploding his body from within.\n\nIn contrast to his major roles in the Marvel comics, the cancellation of the Dreamwave Transformers comics meant that Unicron would play a much lesser role in events. His presence is first hinted at in the second \"War Within\" arc, where the Fallen enlist the Chaos Trinity (Bludgeon, Bugly, and Mindwipe) to capture a number of Transformers (Grimlock, Blitzwing, Jetfire, and Hot Spot) for an arcane ritual to summon the Fallen's Master. It fails, due to a combined strike by Prowl's Autobots and Shockwave's Decepticons, with the Fallen being killed by Primus.\n\nHe makes his first mainstream appearance in volume 3, issue 1 of the main Generation One series, seemingly summoned by Shockwave at the end of the previous volume. He dispatches Scourge at the head of a huge armada of Sweeps to search the galaxy for Cybertron. Scourge locates it, but is shot in the back and deactivated by Shockwave, who used analysis of his body to create the Triple Changers. Unicron destroys Lithone, before beginning to journey to Earth. Dreamwave went bankrupt and the next issue was never released. Writer Chris Sarracini has indicated that he would have followed through on the Unicron storyline, and also would have had the Dreamwave version of Cyclonus rescue Scourge from US government study.\n\nAlthough Dreamwave Productions' Unicron Trilogy comics were cut short halfway through their \"Transformers: Energon\" series, they establish an important piece of information that is used to shape Unicron's story in future fiction. This version of Unicron does not merely consume worlds and seek the destruction of the singular universe, but moves from universe to universe, destroying entire realities until all of causality and existence is obliterated.\n\nHis coming in the \"Armada\" comic universe is foreshadowed when he pulls Optimus Prime into a parallel dimension where Cybertron is devastated. Unicron sends the nearly dead Optimus Prime of the parallel universe to the main universe, who warns them of Unicron's coming before dying. Subsequently, Unicron sends his Heralds - alternates of the Generation 1 versions of Galvatron, Scourge, Thunderwing, Dirge, and Bludgeon - ahead to destroy those who can oppose him (including Megatron) and capture the Mini-Con Matrix.\n\nGalvatron is killed by Megatron using the Star Saber, and the other Heralds are destroyed in their captured Decepticon base by an explosion engineered by Jetfire. Unaware of his Heralds' failure, Unicron now threatens to destroy Prime, but the Mini-Cons and Jetfire manage to rescue Prime, with the power of the Mini-Con Matrix upgrading them and combining them into their Powerlinked mode. They hold off Unicron long enough to escape back to their universe. Unicron comes to the \"Armada\" universe himself, where he is attacked by a combined force of Autobots and Decepticons. They distract him long enough for the Mini-Cons to access the power of the Mini-Con Matrix and destroy the Chaos-Bringer.\n\nUnicron survives, but is crippled and no longer has the power to transform or even move. He is forced to employ servants to do his bidding: Alpha Q and the Terrorcons, who are disgruntled former Decepticons upgraded by Unicron in return for harvesting enough Energon to repower him. While they attack Earth, a rich source of Energon, Unicron sends his four Horsemen - Rhinox, Airazor, Terrorsaur and Cheetor, absorbed by Unicron in the previous battle - against Cybertron, devastating much of it before Optimus Prime stops them. Many of the latter Energon stories are set inside Unicron himself as Megatron, whose Spark also survived the previous battle, attempts to convince Prime to resurrect him in a new body, with the planet eater seemingly unaware of their actions.\n\nAlpha Q shows signs of rebelling against Unicron, and Prime prepares to fight back from inside Unicron. The series was canceled before these plot threads could come to fruition. Writer Simon Furman revealed that a future storyline of the \"Energon\" comic would have included another attack by Unicron.\n\nUnicron made a cameo appearance in the second \"G.I. Joe vs the Transformers\" crossover produced by Devil's Due. At the end of the arc, Cobra operative Doctor Mindbender meets with the cult Cobra-La and discovers their alliance with Unicron. One of Optimus Prime's visions of the future shows Mindbender and Unicron as a coming threat, a prophecy that comes to pass in the fourth crossover \"Black Horizon\".\n\nApparently banished from his world thousands of years ago, Unicron travels the galaxy, devouring planets to quench his hunger and taking their populations as slaves to maintain his inner body works. He runs into trouble when attacking Earth. A strange set of non-human creatures oppose Unicron, threatening to attack him with a metal-devouring organic spore. Before the two sides can annihilate each other, they reach an agreement favouring both parties. The creatures will go into hiding, allowing humanity to develop. When they reach a sufficient technological level to serve as slaves for Unicron's inner workings, they will call Unicron. He will destroy humanity and they will inherit the human-free world he leaves behind. Thousands of years later the pact is kept and the creatures, now calling themselves Cobra-La, summon Unicron via a beacon. After attacking a pirate vessel on the outskirts of a solar system, Unicron journeys to Earth. Hailed as the \"Doom Star\" by terrified humans, Unicron transforms to robot mode and prepares to destroy humanity. He is thwarted when Cosmos and Flint travel through his mouth into his body bearing the metal-eating spores of Cobra-La. Despite the best efforts of his \"anti-bodies\" (the Beastformers), they deliver the spores directly to his brain. He is last seen entering convulsions, indicating he is no longer a threat. It is later mentioned his body is floating around Earth.\n\nIn this continuity, Unicron is thought of as the Transformers' equivalent of the \"boogeyman\". The revelation that Unicron had been banished from his home planet indicates a different origin from ones used for previous incarnations of Unicron.\n\nThe storyline for the Botcon fan convention from 1998 to 2000 featured Unicron's life force ending up on prehistoric Earth following the destruction of his body in \"Transformers: The Movie\". It is eventually found by a lowly Predacon known as the Hunter, who fashions a container for it that he dubs the Decepticon Matrix of Conquest. Taking the name Shokaract, this villain seems to become one with Unicron himself, with the pair of them laying waste to Shokaract's Cybertron and the rest of the universe. However, the instability of the timestream means that Unicron's lifeforce, also known as the Dark Essence, is in danger of being pulled away from prehistoric Earth before the Hunter can find it, which would undo Shokaract's timeline. Shokaract thus dispatches two of his Heralds, Antagony and Cataclysm, to safeguard the Dark Essence, only for Antagony to be captured by Megatron's Predacons and Cataclysm to perish in battle with the Maximal hero Windrazor. Shokaract travels back in time to secure the Essence and destroy the Maximals, only to be engaged in battle by the Covenant of Primus. With the aid of other Transformers from across time and space, the Covenant succeeds in defeating Shokaract, and the Dark Essence of Unicron is drawn back into time, erasing Shokaract's timeline.\n\nWhile writer Simon Furman had ruled out Unicron in the main IDW G1 series, this did not prevent him from using Unicron in his \"Beast Wars\" series. The series opens with a disembodied Magmatron, trapped in temporal limbo by Razorbeast at the end of \"The Gathering\", watching the annihilation of the future Cybertron by a new version of Shokaract and Unicron. Unicron appears in spectral form in issue #2, dispatching Rartorata to Earth to stop an anomaly in the timestream (the disembodied Magmatron) from interfering in the \"ascending\". Unicron plans to use Shokaract as a vessel through which to reemerge into the universe and destroy Cybertron. His plans are foiled when an unlikely alliance of Maximals and Predacons succeed in battling his Heralds. Meanwhile, Ravage transports Shokaract into Magmatron's limbo realm. Realizing the truth of Unicron's intentions, Shokaract kills himself.\n\nIn the official Hasbro Comic Book Universe by IDW, Unicron debuts at the end of \"First Strike\", having been awakened by Joe Colton's invasion against Cybertron.\n\nIn the \"Binaltech\" saga, the future Ravage seen in \"Beast Wars\" alters the . His interference includes trapping all the Decepticons in a spatial rift, with the knowledge that Unicron will soon attack Cybertron. He plans for the Autobots to face Unicron unaided, and the Decepticons to return and conquer whoever prevailed. As a result of these changes, the final showdown between Optimus Prime and Megatron does not occur, and Prime does not die. With Megatron trapped in the rift, Unicron does not encounter the Decepticon leader, and therefore does not Faustian Pact to reformat him into Galvatron.\n\nThrough the events of the story, Optimus Prime learns that the Matrix can destroy Unicron, and he and Ultra Magnus launch an assault on the giant. Within Unicron's body, Optimus Prime is severely damaged and passes the Matrix to Magnus, who completes the mission, and the pair escape as Unicron explodes.\n\nUnicron again appears as a character in the \"\" comics by 3H Enterprises, seemingly the same Unicron as seen in Armada. This time he can physically eat planets as in Generation 1. Set after \"Beast Wars\" and \"Beast Machines\", and his defeat by the Wreckers, he gathers Transformers from across different realities to create an army. He forces them to fight inside Unicron, where he feasts on both the excess Energon they give off and the Sparks of the losers. In response to this, Primus and Alpha Trion resurrect and reformat Optimus Primal to lead the fight against the evil Unicron. After freeing Unicron's captives, the Chaos-Bringer gathers an army of his own, dubbed \"the Decepticons\", to fight against Primus. The army is led by Razorclaw, an alternate version of Tigerhawk, and consists of alternate versions of Obsidian, Tankor, and Reptilion.\n\nAlthough the end of \"Universe\" did not provide a proper conclusion to the storyline, the Cybertron Club Comic portrayed the ending. In \"Revelations, Part 2\", when Optimus Prime is called to another dimension to fight Unicron's heralds, he reflects back on the final battle between Primus's forces and Unicron's army. Unicron suddenly disappeared, his existence ended by the black hole created by his defeat in \"Transformers: Energon\".\n\nThe Transformers club comic further developed Unicron's story for the \"Cybertron\" era, attempting to fill in plot holes. The comic states that Primus' chosen task in Energon is to imprison and burn away Unicron's disembodied spark within a fledgling sun. This sun is the one that was born to save Alpha-Q's world. Megatron's spark, also inside, interferes and the sun collapses, trapping Unicron's spark inside (bridging it between other universes). The black hole is born, and Megatron freed. He uses pieces of Unicron to remake his body, as well as revive Starscream, his most loyal subject. The black hole begins to devour space and time, unraveling historical events and building new ones. This is the reason for the \"errors\" in the Cybertron animated series, as it is following a constantly reshaping universe.\n\nA new Unicron toy was released at the end of the \"Cybertron\" toy line as a Deluxe-class figure with a tank-like alternate mode. Although the character did not appear in \"Transformers: Cybertron\" or its Japanese equivalent \"Transformers: Galaxy Force\", the Hasbro Club comic served to introduce this new version of the Chaos-Bringer. In this story, the black hole contains Unicron's essence and links him simultaneously to all Cybertrons across the Multiverse, giving him the potential to wipe out Primus in one fell swoop. This course is held at bay by Transformers from across the Multiverse, usually consisting of characters derived from Convention and Club exclusives as well as \"Cybertron\" figures that play no role in the television series. In one issue, Soundwave is dispatched to Cybertron after Ramjet and Nemesis Prime's failure. He tosses the Dead Matrix into the black hole, releasing Unicron's spark which quickly overtakes a nearby world, converting its inhabitants into savage maniacs. With the destruction of the planet his body is reborn as a normal sized Transformer.\n\nWhen Unicron attacks Cybertron in the midst of the chaos caused by a Mini-Con civil war, Sentinel Maximus and Omega Prime fight him off with the help of their allies. In the end Unicron is driven off, badly wounded, by Primus. Unicron appears in a flashback in \"The Coming Storm: Part 1\". \"Ask Vector Prime\" later revealed that Unicron's ties to Planet X stretched back years, the planet having once been the remnants of Unicron's body from the events of \"The Transformers: The Movie\", which were blasted into another universe. Ending up on the edge of the Sol system, Unicron attempted to repair himself but was hindered by the actions of the Megatron of that universe. In response, Unicron reformatted his former victims in order to use them to accelerate his reconstruction; they soon converted him into a dimension-hopping battle station and attacked another reality. However, the Autobots of that reality struck back using the power of Zodiac energy, driving Unicron's lifeforce from Planet X and splitting it in two, creating a paradise world that remained behind in the attacked reality and a damaged husk that was eventually destroyed by the inhabitants of Gigantion.\n\nIn the comic \"Hoist the Flag\", set centuries later, Unicron's head proves to be the objective sought by the Star Seeker pirates under Cannonball, whose crew includes a version of Shokaract known as the Hunter.\n\nIn \"Another Light\", Unicron, Primus, and the Thirteen cease to be multiversal singularities, instead existing as multiple separate individuals throughout the multiverse. This results in a Unicron in the Shattered Glass universe who is wholly good, with a counterpart Primus who is entirely evil. The noble Unicron comes across the broken Autobot forces of Optimus Prime, and offers them a chance to be reborn and enlightened. As a result, Optimus Prime is reborn as Nova Prime while his fellow Autobots are likewise reformatted. They return to Cybertron and overthrow Rodimus Prime.\n\nIn association with the Fun Publications' storyline, \"Ask Vector Prime\" also included information on Unicron. This included introducing a version of him from the \"\" universe who was notably distinct from his alternate selves. Having once been the tank-alt-moded ruler of Planet X, he eventually fused himself together with the planetoid and took on his more familiar form from Generation 1 and other continuities.\n\nNote: Information in \"italics\" occur in the alternate storyline where Megatron wins the battle for the Allspark.\n\"Cybertron's status is unknown, mostly abandoned as it began to die. Stockade and a group of Decepticons remain, staying alive by using Nucleon. Stockade believes they can renew Cybertron by summoning a new power source, one related to the AllSpark. They succeed in summoning such an energy being, which enters Cybertron to renew it. To everyone's horror, it announces itself as Unicron. \"\n\n\"The possessed Cybertron is swiftly altered into a form with a large mouth and grasping prongs, turned hostile to those on it, and warped to the Sol system. The Autobots and Decepticons are able to destroy Unicron, but Cybertron is left in its transformed state and seemingly in the Sol system, as well as dead and powerless.\"\n\n\"When the Autobots are ordered off American soil, they regroup \"under\" Cybertron and begin working on the teleportation engines that Unicron left there when he transformed the planet. Using these, they make a decisive strike by teleporting the entire Decepticon army to Cybertron, then teleporting \"Cybertron\" to the far reaches of space. With the engines burnt out and no energy on the planet, the Decepticons are marooned there, at the cost of the Autobots never being able to go home.\"\n\nIn conjunction with the Unite Warriors line, Takara Tomy released a comic detailing how the Galvatronus combiner came to be. Following his defeat at the conclusion of \"The Headmasters\", Galvatron's icy tomb is discovered by Cyclonus, whose body Galvatron modifies to accommodate his own head in the chest compartment. Seeking a more fitting form, Galvatron directs Cyclonus to approach the disembodied head of Unicron, who is convinced to help Galvatron attain a combiner form with Cyclonus as its core. To accomplish this, Unicron opens dimensional rifts in order to bring Curse Armada Thrust, Zombie War Breakdown, and Wandering Roller into their world. To Cyclonus' surprise, Starscream makes an appearance, expressing interest in joining this new alliance. Unicron grants Starscream a new physical form, and Galvatron's head takes control of his new minions to take on his new form of Galvatronus.\n\nDebuting in \"\", the six horns of Unicron began appearing out of the Earth in response to the approach of Cybertron. Unicron is noted by Quintessa to be another name for Earth, and Optimus Prime recognises Unicron as Cybertron's ancient enemy. Quintessa plans to drain Unicron's energy to restore the damaged Cybertron, killing life on Earth in the process. Simmons later helps Burton locate an ancient book containing details about Unicron, noting that the centre-point of Unicron's horns (during the era when all of Earth's continents formed Pangea) is Stonehenge. Megatron and Quintessa begin draining energy from Unicron, but are foiled, and later Quintessa (disguised as a human) approaches a scientist studying one of Unicron's horns to warn him not to touch the chaos-bringer and offer a way to kill him.\n\nUnicron is among the characters appearing in the 2004 \"Transformers\" video game for the PlayStation 2. Unicron begins attacking Cybertron, requiring the Autobots to collect enough Mini-cons to create a power-up mode for Optimus Prime. The player must chase Unicron as he orbits around Cybertron and enter his maw as he prepares to fire, blasting him with the Matrix Cannon until eventually Unicron is destroyed.\n\nUnicron is mentioned a number of times in \"\". Eons ago, Unicron created Thunderwing to serve him and destroy the Matrix of Leadership. After Unicron's demise a meteor of Dark Energon with Thunderwing sealed within crashes on Earth. Optimus Prime comes across the meteor and finds Thunderwing who reveals that he is a minion of Unicron and his mission was to destroy the Matrix. Thunderwing seeks help from the Decepticons for the repairs needed. He fails thanks to the combined efforts of Prime and Jack Darby and falls into a volcano.\n\nUnicron is mentioned a number of times in the novels \", \" and \"\". Unicron is defeated in his attempt to destroy Cybertron early in its history, but emanations of his presence remain and are gathered and stored on Trypticon Station. This substance is a violently addictive poison that can pass on to another bot once its user dies, and is dubbed the Sparks of Unicron or Dark Energon. Ultimately Megatron contaminates the core with Dark Energon, forcing the planet to shut down and reboot. Unicron's name is used by the Decepticons as an oath, and they seem to hold him in a sense of reverence similar to how the Autobots regard Primus. The Quintessons, during their attempt to convince Megatron that they could deliver a Decepticon Matrix of Leadership to him, indicate that the artifact was created by Unicron.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
