He next attended Georgetown University Law School, where he earned a J.D. in 1995. \n\nMiller served as a special assistant to the president in the Clinton Administration and deputy director of the President’s Initiative for One America. He resigned after George W. Bush took office and between jobs, Miller took an interest in food writing, inspired by John Egerton’s book \"Southern Food: At Home, on the Road, in History\". The interest developed into a book, \"Soul Food: The Surprising Story of an American Cuisine, One Plate at a Time\", which he published with the University of North Carolina Press in 2013 and which won the 2014 James Beard Foundation Book Award for Reference and Scholarship. It was also named a non-fiction honor book by the Black Caucus of the American Library Association. \"Soul Food\" combines archival research with Miller's own travels (visiting 150 restaurants in 35 cities) to survey the way the food culture of the southern Black Belt has been \"reestablished and reinterpreted\" as African-Americans moved to other parts of the country, using the lens of diaspora to interpret this evolution.\n\nWhile researching his first book, Miller particularly began collecting historical traces of African-Americans who had staffed the White House kitchen. This became the subject of his second book, \"The President's Kitchen Cabinet: The Story of the African Americans Who Have Fed Our First Families, from the Washingtons to the Obamas\", published in 2017 (again with the University of North Carolina Press). In the course of research, Miller was able to identify the names of 150 African-Americans who cooked in the White House, though there were many more who remain unnamed.

According to James Paul Gee, affinity spaces are locations where groups of people are drawn together because of a shared, strong interest or engagement in a common activity. Often but not always occurring online, affinity spaces encourage the sharing of knowledge or participation in a specific area, and informal learning is a common outcome. In his coining of the term, Gee takes the notion of participatory cultures and reframes it to the idea of \"space\". To Gee, what is happening in these online cultures is not merely a \"culture\" – and far different from a \"community\". In Gee's view, the word \"community\" conjures up images of belongingness and membership (p. 70). Instead, he has defined these worlds as \"spaces\" – a term that allows for the \"robust characterization of the ebbs and flows and differing levels of involvement and participation exhibited by members\" \n\nAccording to Gee (2004), \"An affinity space is a place or set of places where people affiliate with others based primarily on shared activities, interests, and goals, not shared race, class culture, ethnicity, or gender\" (p. 67).\n\nGee (2004) refers to affinity spaces and states, \"Learners 'apprentice' themselves to a group of people who share a certain set of practices (e.g. learning to cook in a family, learning to play video games with a guild, learning to assemble circuit boards in a workplace, learning to splice genes in a biology lab), pick up these practices through joint action with more advanced peers, and advance their abilities to engage and work with others in carrying out such practices\" (p. 70).\n\nWhat Gee (2004) tries to explain about Affinity Spaces is not an attempt to label a group of people. By affinity space he means a space where people can interact and share a lot with each other. the people who are interacting in a space might find themselves as sharing a community with some others in that space, while other people might view their interactions in the space differently. Gee (2004) adds, \" In any case, creating spaces within diverse sorts of people can interact is a leitmotif of the modern world\" (p. 71).\n\nGee described twelve hallmarks of what he terms \"nurturing\" affinity spaces:\n\nBecause members of an affinity space are interested in a common practice/belief/activity, they have common ground and motivation together. Gee says that because of this common interest, affinity spaces are able to bridge barriers of age, race, socio-economic status, and educational level, and thus allow each user to participate as he/she chooses, and both experts and novices are equally legitimate participants in the affinity space While not everyone in affinity spaces is an expert, they are not places where the \"blind are leading the blind.\" Many spaces have unwritten rules that while sharing information, you must share only what you know, provide sources to back up what you say, and in general, leave feedback and comments only in areas you know.\n\nOnline fan fiction sites are examples of affinity spaces. While the goal of the sites is usually to share and read other people's fan fiction creations, informal learning takes place as people have their work read and commented on by \"'beta readers.'\" It is up to the author then to decide what to do with this informal feedback; often, it is used to revise and edit the work, and at the same time, it may aid the author in pinpointing his or her own overall writing flaws.\n\nOther examples come from \"snark sites\" or \"rant communities.\" The goal of these sites is typically to make fun of particular problems, such as poorly written fan fiction, or digital image editing mistakes. As community members criticize other people's work, they reach new levels of sophistication in their evaluations, creating extended vocabularies of terms and categorizing mistakes. In Benjamin Bloom's taxonomy, evaluation is at the top of higher order thinking skills. Since either authors or their friends and fans are likely to come to the defense of works being criticized, rhetoric and logic are two areas where much active learning takes place.\n\n"}

{"id": "3110015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3110015", "title": "Ancient Greek phonology", "text": "Ancient Greek phonology\n\nAncient Greek phonology is the description of the reconstructed phonology or pronunciation of Ancient Greek. This article mostly deals with the pronunciation of the standard Attic dialect of the fifth century BC, used by Plato and other Classical Greek writers, and touches on other dialects spoken at the same time or earlier. The pronunciation of Ancient Greek is not known from direct observation, but determined from other types of evidence. Some details regarding the pronunciation of Attic Greek and other Ancient Greek dialects are unknown, but it is generally agreed that Attic Greek had certain features not present in English or Modern Greek, such as a three-way distinction between voiced, voiceless, and aspirated stops (such as , as in English \"bot, spot, pot\"); a distinction between single and double consonants and short and long vowels in most positions in a word; and a word accent that involved pitch.\n\nKoine Greek, the variety of Greek used after the conquests of Alexander the Great in the fourth century BC, is sometimes included in Ancient Greek, but its pronunciation is described in Koine Greek phonology. For disagreements with the reconstruction given here, see below.\n\nAncient Greek was a pluricentric language, consisting of many dialects. All Greek dialects derive from Proto-Greek and they share certain characteristics, but there were also distinct differences in pronunciation. For instance, the form of Doric in Crete had a digraph , which likely stood for a sound not present in Attic. The early form of Ionic in which the Iliad and Odyssey were composed, and the Aeolic dialect of Sappho, likely had the phoneme at the beginnings of words, sometimes represented by the letter digamma , but it had been lost in the standard Attic dialect.\n\nThe pluricentric nature of Ancient Greek differs from that of Latin, which was composed of basically one variety from the earliest Old Latin texts until Classical Latin. Latin only formed dialects once it was spread over Europe by the Roman Empire; these Vulgar Latin dialects became the Romance languages.\n\nThe main dialect groups of Ancient Greek are Arcadocypriot, Aeolic, Doric, Ionic, and Attic. These form two main groups: East Greek, which includes Arcadocypriot, Aeolic, Ionic, and Attic, and West Greek, which consists of Doric along with Northwest Greek and Achaean.\n\nOf the main dialects, all but Arcadocypriot have literature in them. The Ancient Greek literary dialects do not necessarily represent the native speech of the authors that use them. A primarily Ionic-Aeolic dialect, for instance, is used in epic poetry, while pure Aeolic is used in lyric poetry. Both Attic and Ionic are used in prose, and Attic is used in most parts of the Athenian tragedies, with Doric forms in the choral sections.\n\nMost of the East Greek dialects palatalized or assibilated to before . West Greek, including Doric, did not undergo this sound change in certain cases, and through the influence of Doric neither did the Thessalian and Boeotian dialects of Aeolic.\n\nArcadocypriot was one of the first Greek dialects in Greece. Mycenaean Greek, the form of Greek spoken before the Greek Dark Ages, seems to be an early form of Arcadocypriot. Clay tablets with Mycenaean Greek in Linear B have been found over a wide area, from Thebes in Central Greece, to Mycenae and Pylos on the Peloponnese, to Knossos on Crete. However, during the Ancient Greek period, Arcadocypriot was only spoken in Arcadia, in the interior of the Peloponnese, and on Cyprus. The dialects of these two areas remained remarkably similar despite the great geographical distance.\n\nAeolic is closely related to Arcadocypriot. It was originally spoken in eastern Greece north of the Peloponnese: in Thessaly, in Locris, Phocis, and southern Aetolia, and in Boeotia, a region close to Athens. Aeolic was carried to Aeolis, on the coast of Asia Minor, and the nearby island of Lesbos. By the time of Ancient Greek, the only Aeolic dialects that remained in Greece were Thessalian and Boeotian. The Aeolic dialects of Greece adopted some characteristics of Doric, since they were located near Doric-speaking areas, while the Aeolian and Lesbian dialects remained pure.\n\nBoeotian underwent vowel shifts similar to those that occurred later in Koine Greek, converting to , to , and to . These are reflected in spelling (see Boeotian Greek phonology). Aeolic also retained .\n\nHomeric or Epic Greek, the literary form of Archaic Greek used in the epic poems, Iliad and the Odyssey, is based on early Ionic and Aeolic, with Arcadocypriot forms. In its original form, it likely had the semivowel and a voiceless version , as indicated by the meter in some cases. This sound is sometimes written as in inscriptions, but not in the Attic-influenced text of Homer.\n\nThe Doric dialect, the most important member of West Greek, originated from western Greece. Through the Dorian invasion, Doric displaced the native Arcadocypriot and Aeolic dialects in some areas of central Greece, on the Peloponnese, and on Crete, and strongly influenced the Thessalian and Boeotian dialects of Aeolic.\n\nDoric dialects are classified by which vowel they have as the result of compensatory lengthening and contraction: those that have are called Severer or Old, and those that have , as Attic does, are called Milder or New. Laconian and Cretan, spoken in Laconia, the region of Sparta, and on Crete, are two Old Doric dialects.\n\nAttic and Ionic share a vowel shift not present in any other East or West Greek dialects. They both raised Proto-Greek long to (see below). Later on, Attic lowered found immediately after back to , differentiating itself from Ionic. All other East and West Greek dialects retain original .\n\nIonic was spoken around the Aegean Sea, including in Ionia, a region of Anatolia south of Aeolis, for which it was named. Ionic contracts vowels less often than Attic (see below).\n\nAttic is the standard dialect taught in modern introductory courses in Ancient Greek, and the one that has the most literature written in it. It was spoken in Athens and Attica, the surrounding region. Old Attic, which was used by the historian Thucydides and the tragedians, replaced the native Attic with the of other dialects. Later writers, such as Plato, use the native Attic forms.\n\nKoine, the form of Greek spoken during the Hellenistic period, was primarily based on Attic Greek, with some influences from other dialects. It underwent many sound changes, including development of aspirated and voiced stops into fricatives and the shifting of many vowels and diphthongs to (iotacism). In the Byzantine period it developed into Medieval Greek, which later became standard Modern Greek or Demotic.\n\nTsakonian, a modern form of Greek mutually unintelligible with Standard Modern Greek, derived from the Laconian variety of Doric, and is therefore the only surviving descendant of a non-Attic dialect.\n\nAttic Greek had about 15 consonant phonemes: nine stop consonants, two fricatives, and four or six sonorants. Modern Greek has about the same number of consonants. The main difference between the two is that Modern Greek has voiced and voiceless fricatives that developed from Ancient Greek voiced and aspirated stops.\n\nIn the table below, the phonemes of standard Attic are unmarked, allophones are enclosed in parentheses. The sounds marked by asterisks appear in dialects or in earlier forms of Greek, but may not be phonemes in standard Attic.\n\nAncient Greek had nine stops. The grammarians classified them in three groups, distinguished by voice-onset time: voiceless aspirated, voiceless unaspirated (tenuis), and voiced. The aspirated stops are written . The tenuis stops are written , with representing lack of aspiration and voicing, or . The voiced stops are written . For the Ancient Greek terms for these three groups, see below; see also the section on spirantization.\n\nEnglish distinguishes two types of stops: voiceless and voiced. Voiceless stops have three main pronunciations (allophones): moderately aspirated at the beginning of a word before a vowel, unaspirated after , and unaspirated, unreleased, glottalized, or debuccalized at the end of a word. English voiced stops are often only partially voiced. Thus, some pronunciations of the English stops are similar to the pronunciations of Ancient Greek stops.\n\nAttic Greek had only two fricative phonemes: the voiceless alveolar sibilant and the glottal fricative .\n\n\nAccording to W.S. Allen, zeta in Attic Greek likely represented the consonant cluster , phonetically . For metrical purposes it was treated as a double consonant, thus forming a heavy syllable. In Archaic Greek, when the letter was adopted from Phoenician zayin, the sound was probably an affricate . In Koine Greek, represented . It is more likely that this developed from rather than from Attic .\n\nAncient Greek has two nasals: the bilabial nasal , written and the alveolar nasal , written . Depending on the phonetic environment, the phoneme was pronounced as ; see below. On occasion, the phoneme participates in true gemination without any assimilation in place of articulation, as for example in the word . Artificial gemination for metrical purposes is also found occasionally, as in the form , occurring in the first verse of Homer's Odyssey.\n\nAncient Greek has the liquids and , written and respectively.\n\nThe letter lambda probably represented a lateral (\"clear\") as in Modern Greek and most European languages, rather than a velarized (\"dark\") as in English in coda position.\n\nThe letter rho was pronounced as an alveolar trill , as in Italian or Modern Greek rather than as in standard varieties of English or French. At the beginning of a word, it was pronounced as a voiceless alveolar trill . In some cases, initial in poetry was pronounced as a long trill (phonemically ), shown by the fact that the previous syllable is counted as heavy: for instance must be pronounced as in Euripides, Electra 772, as in Aristophanes, The Frogs 1059, and as in Iliad 12.159.\n\nThe semivowels were not present in standard Attic Greek at the beginnings of words. However, diphthongs ending in were usually pronounced with a double semivowel or before a vowel. Allen suggests that these were simply semivocalic allophones of the vowels, although in some cases they developed from earlier semivowels.\n\nThe labio-velar approximant at the beginning of a syllable survived in some non-Attic dialects, such as Arcadian and Aeolic; a voiceless labio-velar approximant probably also occurred in Pamphylian and Boeotian. is sometimes written with the letter digamma , and later with and , and was written with digamma and heta :\n\nEvidence from the poetic meter of Homer suggests that also occurred in the Archaic Greek of the Iliad and Odyssey, although they would not have been pronounced by Attic speakers and are not written in the Attic-influenced form of the text. The presence of these consonants would explain some cases of absence of elision, some cases in which the meter demands a heavy syllable but the text has a light syllable (\"positional quantity\"), and some cases in which a long vowel before a short vowel is not shortened (absence of epic correption).\n\nIn the table below the scansion of the examples is shown with the breve for light syllables, the macron for heavy ones, and the pipe for the divisions between metrical feet. The sound is written using digamma, and with digamma and rough breathing, although the letter never appears in the actual text.\n\nSingle and double (geminated) consonants were distinguished from each other in Ancient Greek: for instance, contrasted with (also written ). In Ancient Greek poetry, a vowel followed by a double consonant counts as a heavy syllable in meter. Doubled consonants usually only occur between vowels, not at the beginning or the end of a word, except in the case of , for which see above.\n\nGemination was lost in Standard Modern Greek, so that all consonants that used to be geminated are pronounced as singletons. Cypriot Greek, the Modern Greek dialect of Cyprus, however, preserves geminate consonants.\n\nA doubled in Attic corresponds to a in Ionic and other dialects. This sound arose from historic palatalization (see below).\n\nArchaic and Classical Greek vowels and diphthongs varied by dialect. The tables below show the vowels of Classical Attic in the IPA, paired with the vowel letters that represent them in the standard Ionic alphabet. The earlier Old Attic alphabet had certain differences. Attic Greek of the 5th century BC likely had 5 short and 7 long vowels: and . Vowel length was phonemic: some words are distinguished from each other by vowel length. In addition, Classical Attic had many diphthongs, all ending in or ; these are discussed below.\n\nIn standard Ancient Greek spelling, the long vowels (spelled ) are distinguished from the short vowels (spelled ), but the long–short pairs , , and are each written with a single letter, . This is the reason for the terms for vowel letters described below. In grammars, textbooks, or dictionaries, are sometimes marked with macrons () to indicate that they are long, or breves () to indicate that they are short.\n\nFor the purposes of accent, vowel length is measured in morae: long vowels and most diphthongs count as two morae; short vowels, and the diphthongs in certain endings, count as one mora. A one-mora vowel could be accented with high pitch, but two-mora vowels could be accented with falling or rising pitch.\n\nThe close and open short vowels were similar in quality to the corresponding long vowels .\n\nProto-Greek close back rounded shifted to front early in Attic and Ionic, around the 6th or 7th century BC (see below). remained only in diphthongs; it did not shift in Boeotian, so when Boeotians adopted the Attic alphabet, they wrote their unshifted using .\n\nThe situation with the mid vowels was more complex. In the early Classical period, there were two short mid vowels , but four long mid vowels: close-mid and open-mid . Since the short mid vowels changed to long close-mid rather than long open-mid by compensatory lengthening in Attic, E.H. Sturtevant suggests that the short mid vowels were close-mid, but Allen says this is not necessarily true.\n\nBy the mid-4th century BC, the close-mid back shifted to , partly because had shifted to . Similarly, the close-mid front changed to . These changes triggered a shift of the open-mid vowels to become mid or close-mid , and this is the pronunciation they had in early Koine Greek.\n\nIn Latin, on the other hand, all short vowels except for were much more open than the corresponding long vowels. This made long similar in quality to short , and for this reason the letters and were frequently confused with each other in Roman inscriptions. This also explains the vocalism of New Testament Greek words such as λεγεών ('legion'; < Lat. \"legio\") or λέντιον ('towel'; < Lat. \"linteum\"), where Latin was perceived to be similar to Greek .\n\nIn Attic, the open-mid and close-mid each have three main origins. Some cases of the open-mid vowels developed from Proto-Greek . In other cases they developed from contraction. Finally, some cases of , only in Attic and Ionic, developed from earlier by the Attic–Ionic vowel shift.\n\nIn a few cases, the long close-mid vowels developed from monophthongization of the pre-Classical falling diphthongs . In most cases, they arose through compensatory lengthening of the short vowels or through contraction.\n\nIn both Aeolic and Doric, Proto-Greek did not shift to . In some dialects of Doric, such as Laconian and Cretan, contraction and compensatory lengthening resulted in open-mid vowels , and in others they resulted in the close-mid . Sometimes the Doric dialects using the open-mid vowels are called Severer, and the ones using the close-mid vowels are called Milder.\n\nAttic had many diphthongs, all falling diphthongs with as the second semivocalic element, and either with a short or long first element. Diphthongs with a short first element are sometimes called \"proper diphthongs\", while diphthongs with a long first element are sometimes called \"improper diphthongs.\" Whether they have a long or a short first element, all diphthongs count as two morae when applying the accent rules, like long vowels, except for in certain cases. Overall Attic and Koine show a pattern of monophthongization: they tend to change diphthongs to single vowels.\n\nThe most common diphthongs were and . The long diphthongs occurred rarely. The diphthongs changed to in the early Classical period in most cases, but remained before vowels.\n\nIn the tables below, the diphthongs that were monophthongized in most cases are preceded by an asterisk, and the rarer diphthongs are in parentheses.\n\nThe second element of a diphthong was often pronounced as a doubled semivowel or before vowels, and in other cases it was often lost:\n\nThe diphthong merged with the long close front rounded vowel in Koine. It likely first became . Change to would be assimilation: the back vowel becoming front because of the following front vowel . This may have been the pronunciation in Classical Attic. Later it must have become , parallel to the monophthongization of , and then , but when words with were borrowed into Latin, the Greek digraph was represented with the Latin digraph , representing the diphthong .\n\nThucydides reports the confusion of two words (), which makes more sense if was pronounced :\n\nIn the diphthongs , the offglide became a consonant in Koine Greek, and they became Modern Greek . The long diphthongs lost their offglide and merged with the long vowels by the time of Koine Greek.\n\nMany different forms of the Greek alphabet were used for the regional dialects of the Greek language during the Archaic and early Classical periods. The Attic dialect, however, used two forms. The first was the Old Attic alphabet, and the second is the Ionic alphabet, introduced to Athens around the end of the 5th century BC during the archonship of Eucleides. The last is the standard alphabet in modern editions of Ancient Greek texts, and the one used for Classical Attic, standard Koine, and Medieval Greek, finally developing into the alphabet used for Modern Greek.\n\nMost double consonants are written using double letters: represent or . The geminate versions of the aspirated stops are written with the digraphs , and geminate is written as , since represents in the standard orthography of Ancient Greek.\n\nVoiceless is usually written with the \"spiritus asper\" as and transcribed as \"rh\" in Latin. The same orthography is sometimes encountered when is geminated, as in , sometimes written , giving rise to the transliteration \"rrh\". This example also illustrates that () assimilates to following , creating gemination.\n\nThe close front rounded vowels and (an evolution of and respectively) are both represented in writing by the letter upsilon () irrespective of length.\n\nIn Classical Attic, the spellings and represented respectively the vowels and (the latter being an evolution of ), from original diphthongs, compensatory lengthening, or contraction.\n\nThe above information about the usage of the vowel letters applies to the classical orthography of Attic, after Athens took over the orthographic conventions of the Ionic alphabet in 403 BC. In the earlier, traditional Attic orthography there was only a smaller repertoire of vowel symbols: , , , , and . The letters and were still missing. All five vowel symbols could at that stage denote either a long or a short vowel. Moreover, the letters and could respectively denote the long open-mid , the long close-mid and the short mid phonemes . The Ionic alphabet brought the new letters and for the one set of long vowels, and the convention of using the digraph spellings and for the other, leaving simple and to be used only for the short vowels. However, the remaining vowel letters , and continued to be ambiguous between long and short phonemes.\n\nIn the Old Attic alphabet, was written with the letterform of eta . In the Ionic dialect of Asia Minor, was lost early on, and the letter in the Ionic alphabet represented . In 403 BC, when the Ionic alphabet was adopted in Athens, the sound ceased to be represented in writing.\n\nIn some inscriptions was represented by a symbol formed from the left-hand half of the original letter: (). Later grammarians, during the time of the Hellenistic Koine, developed that symbol further into a diacritic, the rough breathing (; ; for short), which was written on the top of the initial vowel. Correspondingly, they introduced the mirror image diacritic called smooth breathing (; ; for short), which indicated the absence of . These marks were not used consistently until the time of the Byzantine Empire.\n\nAncient Greek words were divided into syllables. A word has one syllable for every short vowel, long vowel, or diphthong. In addition, syllables began with a consonant if possible, and sometimes ended with a consonant. Consonants at the beginning of the syllable are the syllable onset, the vowel in the middle is a nucleus, and the consonant at the end is a coda.\n\nIn dividing words into syllables, each vowel or diphthong belongs to one syllable. A consonant between vowels goes with the following vowel. In the following transcriptions, a period separates syllables.\n\nAny remaining consonants are added at the end of a syllable. And when a double consonant occurs between vowels, it is divided between syllables. One half of the double consonant goes to the previous syllable, forming a coda, and one goes to the next, forming an onset. Clusters of two or three consonants are also usually divided between syllables, with at least one consonant joining the previous vowel and forming the syllable coda of its syllable, but see below.\n\nSyllables in Ancient Greek were either light or heavy. This distinction is important in Ancient Greek poetry, which was made up of patterns of heavy and light syllables. Syllable weight is based on both consonants and vowels. Ancient Greek accent, by contrast, is only based on vowels.\n\nA syllable ending in a short vowel, or the diphthongs and in certain noun and verb endings, was light. All other syllables were heavy: that is, syllables ending in a long vowel or diphthong, a short vowel and consonant, or a long vowel or diphthong and consonant.\n\nGreek grammarians called heavy syllables ('long', singular ), and placed them in two categories. They called a syllable with a long vowel or diphthong ('long by nature'), and a syllable ending in a consonant ('long by position'). These terms were translated into Latin as ' and '. However, Indian grammarians distinguished vowel length and syllable weight by using the terms \"heavy\" and \"light\" for syllable quantity and the terms \"long\" and \"short\" only for vowel length. This article adopts their terminology, since not all metrically heavy syllables have long vowels; e.g.:\n\nPoetic meter shows which syllables in a word counted as heavy, and knowing syllable weight allows us to determine how consonant clusters were divided between syllables. Syllables before double consonants, and most syllables before consonant clusters, count as heavy. Here the letters count as consonant clusters. This indicates that double consonants and most consonant clusters were divided between syllables, with at least the first consonant belonging to the preceding syllable.\n\nIn Attic poetry, syllables before a cluster of a stop and a liquid or nasal are commonly light rather than heavy. This was called \"\" ('Attic shortening'), since here an ordinarily \"long\" syllable became \"short\".\n\nIn Attic Greek, any single consonant and many consonant clusters can occur as a syllable onset (the beginning of a syllable). Certain consonant clusters occur as onsets, while others do not occur.\n\nSix stop clusters occur. All of them agree in voice-onset time, and begin with a labial or velar and end with a dental. Thus, the clusters are allowed. Certain stop clusters do not occur as onsets: clusters beginning with a dental and ending with a labial or velar, and clusters of stops that disagree in voice onset time.\n\nIn Ancient Greek, any vowel may end a word, but the only consonants that may normally end a word are . If a stop ended a word in Proto-Indo-European, this was dropped in Ancient Greek, as in (from ; compare the genitive singular ποιήματος). Other consonants may end a word, however, when a final vowel is elided before a word beginning in a vowel, as in (from ).\n\nAncient Greek had a pitch accent, unlike the stress accent of Modern Greek and English. One mora of a word was accented with high pitch. A mora is a unit of vowel length; in Ancient Greek, short vowels have one mora and long vowels and diphthongs have two morae. Thus, a one-mora vowel could have accent on its one mora, and a two-mora vowel could have accent on either of its two morae. The position of accent was free, with certain limitations. In a given word, it could appear in several different positions, depending on the lengths of the vowels in the word.\n\nIn the examples below, long vowels and diphthongs are represented with two vowel symbols, one for each mora. This does not mean that the long vowel has two separate vowels in different syllables. Syllables are separated by periods ; anything between two periods is pronounced in one syllable.\n\nThe accented mora is marked with acute accent . A vowel with rising pitch contour is marked with a caron , and a vowel with a falling pitch contour is marked with a circumflex .\n\nThe position of the accent in Ancient Greek was phonemic and distinctive: certain words are distinguished by which mora in them is accented. The position of the accent was also distinctive on long vowels and diphthongs: either the first or the second mora could be accented. Phonetically, a two-mora vowel had a rising or falling pitch contour, depending on which of its two morae was accented:\n\nAccent marks were never used until around 200 BC. They were first used in Alexandria, and Aristophanes of Byzantium is said to have invented them. There are three: the acute, circumflex, and grave . The shape of the circumflex is a merging of the acute and grave.\n\nThe acute represented high or rising pitch, the circumflex represented falling pitch, but what the grave represented is uncertain. Early on, the grave was used on every syllable without an acute or circumflex. Here the grave marked all unaccented syllables, which had lower pitch than the accented syllable.\n\nLater on, a grave was only used to replace a final acute before another full word; the acute was kept before an enclitic or at the end of a phrase. This usage was standardized in the Byzantine era, and is used in modern editions of Ancient Greek texts. Here it might mark a lowered version of a high-pitched syllable.\n\nGreek underwent many sound changes. Some occurred between Proto-Indo-European (PIE) and Proto-Greek (PGr), some between the Mycenaean Greek and Ancient Greek periods, which are separated by about 300 years (the Greek Dark Ages), and some during the Koine Greek period. Some sound changes occurred only in particular Ancient Greek dialects, not in others, and certain dialects, such as Boeotian and Laconian, underwent sound changes similar to the ones that occurred later in Koine. This section primarily describes sound changes that occurred between the Mycenaean and Ancient Greek periods and during the Ancient Greek period.\n\nFor sound changes occurring in Proto-Greek and in Koine Greek, see and Koine Greek phonology.\n\nIn Proto-Greek, the PIE sibilant became by debuccalization in many cases.\n\nClusters of and a sonorant (liquid or nasal) at the beginning of a word became a voiceless resonant in some forms of Archaic Greek. Voiceless remained in Attic at the beginning of words, and became the regular allophone of in this position; voiceless merged with ; and the rest of the voiceless resonants merged with the voiced resonants.\n\nPIE remained in clusters with stops and at the end of a word:\n\nThe PIE semivowel , IPA , was sometimes debuccalized and sometimes strengthened initially. How this development was conditioned is unclear; the involvement of the laryngeals has been suggested. In certain other positions, it was kept, and frequently underwent other sound changes:\n\nBetween vowels, became . Intervocalic probably occurred in Mycenaean. In most cases it was lost by the time of Ancient Greek. In a few cases, it was transposed to the beginning of the word. Later, initial was lost by psilosis.\n\nBy morphological leveling, intervocalic was kept in certain noun and verb forms: for instance, the marking the stems for the future and aorist tenses.\n\nThrough Grassmann's law, an aspirated consonant loses its aspiration when followed by another aspirated consonant in the next syllable; this law also affects resulting from debuccalization of ; for example:\n\nIn some cases, the sound in Attic corresponds to the sound in other dialects. These sounds developed from palatalization of , and sometimes , , and before the pre-Greek semivowel . This sound was likely pronounced as an affricate or earlier in the history of Greek, but inscriptions do not show the spelling , which suggests that an affricate pronunciation did not occur in the Classical period.\n\nMycenaean Greek had three labialized velar stops , aspirated, tenuis, and voiced. These derived from PIE labiovelars and from sequences of a velar and , and were similar to the three regular velars of Ancient Greek , except with added lip-rounding. They were written all using the same symbols in Linear B, and are transcribed as \"q\".\n\nIn Ancient Greek, all labialized velars merged with other stops: labials , dentals , and velars . Which one they became depended on dialect and phonological environment. Because of this, certain words that originally had labialized velars have different stops depending on dialect, and certain words from the same root have different stops even in the same Ancient Greek dialect.\n\nNear or , the labialized velars had already lost their labialization in the Mycenaean period.\n\nThrough \"psilosis\" ('stripping'), from the term for lack of (see below), the was lost even at the beginnings of words. This sound change did not occur in Attic until the Koine period, but occurred in East Ionic and Lesbian Aeolic, and therefore can be seen in certain Homeric forms. These dialects are called \"psilotic\".\n\nEven later, during the Koine Greek period, disappeared totally from Greek and never reappeared, resulting in Modern Greek not possessing this phoneme at all.\n\nThe Classical Greek aspirated and voiced stops changed to voiceless and voiced fricatives during the period of Koine Greek (spirantization, a form of lenition).\n\nSpirantization of occurred earlier in Laconian Greek. Some examples are transcribed by Aristophanes and Thucydides, such as for ('Yes, by the two gods!') and for (\"virgin goddess!') (\"Lysistrata\" 142 and 1263), for ('sacrificial victim') (\"Histories\" book 5, chapter 77). These spellings indicate that was pronounced as a dental fricative or a sibilant , the same change that occurred later in Koine. Greek spelling, however, does not have a letter for a labial or velar fricative, so it is impossible to tell whether also changed to .\n\nIn Attic, Ionic, and Doric, vowels were usually lengthened when a following consonant was lost. The syllable before the consonant was originally heavy, but loss of the consonant would cause it to be light. Therefore, the vowel before the consonant was lengthened, so that the syllable would continue to be heavy. This sound change is called compensatory lengthening, because the vowel length compensates for the loss of the consonant. The result of lengthening depended on dialect and time period. The table below shows all possible results:\nWherever the digraphs correspond to original diphthongs they are called \"genuine diphthongs\", in all other cases, they are called \"spurious diphthongs\".\n\nIn Attic, some cases of long vowels arose through contraction of adjacent short vowels where a consonant had been lost between them. came from contraction of and through contraction of , , or . arose from and , from , and from and . Contractions involving diphthongs ending in resulted in the long diphthongs .\n\nUncontracted forms are found in other dialects, such as in Ionic.\n\nThe diphthongs became the long monophthongs and before the Classical period.\n\nIn Archaic Greek, upsilon represented the back vowel . In Attic and Ionic, this vowel was fronted around the 6th or 7th century BC. It likely first became central , and then the front .\n\nDuring the Classical period, was raised to , and thus took up the empty space of the earlier phoneme. The fact that was never confused with indicates that was fronted before was raised.\n\nIn early Koine Greek, was raised and merged with original .\n\nIn Attic and Ionic, the Proto-Greek long shifted to . This shift did not happen in the other dialects. Thus, some cases of Attic and Ionic correspond to Doric and Aeolic , and other cases correspond to Doric and Aeolic .\n\nThe vowel first shifted to , at which point it was distinct from Proto-Greek long , and then later and merged as . This is indicated by inscriptions in the Cyclades, which write Proto-Greek as , but the shifted as and new from compensatory lengthening as .\n\nIn Attic, both and Proto-Greek were written as , but they merged to at the end of the 5th century BC. At this point, nouns in the masculine first declension were confused with third-declension nouns with stems in. The first-declension nouns had resulting from original , while the third-declension nouns had resulting from contraction of .\n\nIn addition, words that had original in both Attic and Doric were given false Doric forms with in the choral passages of Athenian plays, indicating that Athenians could not distinguish the Attic-Ionic shifted from original Proto-Greek .\n\nIn Attic, rather than is found immediately after , except in certain cases where the sound formerly came between the and the (see above).\n\nThe fact that is found instead of may indicate that earlier, the vowel shifted to in all cases, but then shifted back to after (reversion), or that the vowel never shifted at all in these cases. Sihler says that Attic is from reversion.\n\nThis shift did not affect cases of long that developed from the contraction of certain sequences of vowels that contain . Thus, the vowels and are common in verbs with \"a\"-contracted present and imperfect forms, such as \"see\". The examples below are shown with the hypothetical original forms from which they were contracted.\n\nAlso unaffected was long that arose by compensatory lengthening of short . Thus, Attic and Ionic had a contrast between the feminine genitive singular and feminine accusative plural , forms of the adjective and pronoun \"this, that\". The first derived from an original \"*tautās\" with shifting of \"ā\" to \"ē\", the other from \"*tautans\" with compensatory lengthening of \"ans\" to \"ās\".\n\nWhen one consonant comes next to another in verb or noun conjugation or word derivation, various sandhi rules apply. When these rules affect the forms of nouns and adjectives or of compound words, they are reflected in spelling. Between words, the same rules also applied, but they are not reflected in standard spelling, only in inscriptions.\n\nRules:\n\nThe alveolar nasal assimilates in place of articulation, changing to a labial or velar nasal before labials or velars:\n\nWhen precedes , the first consonant assimilates to the second, gemination takes place, and the combination is pronounced , as in from underlying .\n\nThe sound of zeta develops from original in some cases, and in other cases from . In the second case, it was likely first pronounced or , and this cluster underwent metathesis early in the Ancient Greek period. Metathesis is likely in this case; clusters of a voiced stop and , like , do not occur in Ancient Greek, since they change to by assimilation (see below), while clusters with the opposite order, like , pronounced , do occur.\n\nAncient grammarians, such as Aristotle in his \"Poetics\" and Dionysius Thrax in his Art of Grammar, categorized letters () according to what speech sounds ( 'elements') they represented. They called the letters for vowels ('pronounceable', singular ); the letters for the nasals, liquids, and , and the letters for the consonant clusters , ('half-voiced', singular ); and the letters for the stops ('voiceless', singular ). Dionysius also called consonants in general ('pronounced with [a vowel]', ).\n\nAll the Greek terms for letters or sounds are nominalized adjectives in the neuter gender, to agree with the neuter nouns and , since they were used to modify the nouns, as in ('pronounceable element') or ('unpronounceable letters'). Many also use the root of the deverbal noun ('voice, sound').\n\nThe words were loan-translated into Latin as '. The Latin words are feminine because the Latin noun ' ('letter') is feminine. They were later borrowed into English as \"vowel\", \"consonant\", \"semivowel\", \"mute\".\n\nThe categories of vowel letters were ('two-time, short, long'). These adjectives describe whether the vowel letters represented both long and short vowels, only short vowels or only long vowels. Additionally, vowels that ordinarily functioned as the first and second elements of diphthongs were called ('prefixable') and ('suffixable'). The category of included both diphthongs and the spurious diphthongs , which were pronounced as long vowels in the Classical period.\n\nThe categories and roughly correspond to the modern terms \"continuant\" and \"stop\". Greek grammarians placed the letters in the category of stops, not of continuants, indicating that they represented stops in Ancient Greek, rather than fricatives, as in Modern Greek.\n\nStops were divided into three categories using the adjectives ('thick'), ('thin'), and ('middle'), as shown in the table below. The first two terms indicate a binary opposition typical of Greek thought: they referred to stops with and without aspiration. The voiced stops did not fit in either category and so they were called \"middle\". The concepts of voice and voicelessness (presence or absence of vibration of the vocal folds) were unknown to the Greeks and were not developed in the Western grammatical tradition until the 19th century, when the Sanskrit grammatical tradition began to be studied by Westerners.\n\nThe glottal fricative was originally called ('breath'), and it was classified as a , the category to which the acute, grave, and circumflex accents also belong. Later, a diacritic for the sound was created, and it was called pleonastically ('rough breathing'). Finally, a diacritic representing the absence of was created, and it was called ('smooth breathing'). The diacritics were also called and ('thick accent' and 'thin accent'), from which come the Modern Greek nouns and .\n\nThe above information is based on a large body of evidence which was discussed extensively by linguists and philologists of the 19th and 20th centuries. The following section provides a short summary of the kinds of evidence and arguments that have been used in this debate, and gives some hints as to the sources of uncertainty that still prevails with respect to some details.\n\nWhenever a new set of written symbols, such as an alphabet, is created for a language, the written symbols typically correspond to the spoken sounds, and the spelling or orthography is therefore phonemic or \"transparent\": it is easy to pronounce a word by seeing how it is spelled, and conversely to spell a word by knowing how it is pronounced. Until the pronunciation of the language changes, spelling mistakes do not occur, since spelling and pronunciation match each other.\n\nWhen the pronunciation changes, there are two options. The first is spelling reform: the spelling of words is changed to reflect the new pronunciation. In this case, the date of a spelling reform generally indicates the approximate time when the pronunciation changed.\n\nThe second option is that the spelling remains the same, while the pronunciation changes. In this case, the spelling system is called \"conservative\" or \"historical\", since it reflects the pronunciation at an earlier period in the language. It is also called \"opaque\", because there is not a simple correspondence between written symbols and spoken sounds: it is more difficult to pronounce a word by seeing its spelling, and conversely to spell a word by knowing how to pronounce it.\n\nIn a language with a historical spelling system, spelling mistakes indicate change in pronunciation. Writers with incomplete knowledge of the spelling system will misspell words, and in general their misspellings reflect the way they pronounced the words.\n\n\nSpelling mistakes provide limited evidence: they only indicate the pronunciation of the scribe who made the spelling mistake, not the pronunciation of all speakers of the language at the time. Ancient Greek was a language with many regional variants and social registers. Many of the pronunciation changes of Koine Greek probably occurred earlier in some regional pronunciations and sociolects of Attic even in the Classical Age, but the older pronunciations were preserved in more learned speech.\n\nGreek literature sometimes contains representations of animal cries in Greek letters. The most often quoted example is , used to render the cry of sheep, and is used as evidence that beta had a voiced bilabial plosive pronunciation and eta was a long open-mid front vowel. Onomatopoeic verbs such as for the lowing of cattle (cf. Latin '), for the roaring of lions (cf. Latin ') and as the name of the cuckoo (cf. Latin \"\") suggest an archaic pronunciation of long upsilon, before this vowel was fronted to .\n\nSounds undergo regular changes, such as assimilation or dissimilation, in certain environments within words, which are sometimes indicated in writing. These can be used to reconstruct the nature of the sounds involved.\n\nMorphophonological alternations like the above are often treated differently in non-standard spellings than in standardised literary spelling. This may lead to doubts about the representativeness of the literary dialect and may in some cases force slightly different reconstructions than if one were only to take the literary texts of the high standard language into account. Thus, e.g.:\n\n\nThe metres used in Classical Greek poetry are based on the patterns of light and heavy syllables, and can thus sometimes provide evidence as to the length of vowels where this is not evident from the orthography. By the 4th century AD poetry was normally written using stress-based metres, suggesting that the distinctions between long and short vowels had been lost by then, and the pitch accent had been replaced by a stress accent.\n\nSome ancient grammarians attempt to give systematic descriptions of the sounds of the language. In other authors one can sometimes find occasional remarks about correct pronunciation of certain sounds. However, both types of evidence are often difficult to interpret, because the phonetic terminology of the time was often vague, and it is often not clear in what relation the described forms of the language stand to those which were actually spoken by different groups of the population.\n\nImportant ancient authors include:\n\n\nSometimes the comparison of standard Attic Greek with the written forms of other Greek dialects, or the humorous renderings of dialectal speech in Attic theatrical works, can provide hints as to the phonetic value of certain spellings. An example of this treatment with Spartan Greek is given above.\n\nThe spelling of Greek loanwords in other languages and vice versa can provide important hints about pronunciation. However, the evidence is often difficult to interpret or indecisive. The sounds of loanwords are often not taken over identically into the receiving language. Where the receiving language lacks a sound that corresponds exactly to that of the source language, sounds are usually mapped to some other, similar sound.\n\nIn this regard, Latin is of great value to the reconstruction of ancient Greek phonology because of its close proximity to the Greek world which caused numerous Greek words to be borrowed by the Romans. At first, Greek loanwords denoting technical terms or proper names which contained the letter were imported in Latin with the spelling ' or ', indicating an effort to imitate, albeit imperfectly, a sound that Latin lacked. Later on, in the 1st centuries AD, spellings with ' start to appear in such loanwords, signaling the onset of the fricative pronunciation of . Thus, in the 2nd century AD, ' replaces '. At about the same time, the letter ' also begins to be used as a substitute for the letter , for lack of a better choice, indicating that the sound of Greek theta had become a fricative as well.\n\nFor the purpose of borrowing certain other Greek words, the Romans added the letters ' and ' to the Latin alphabet, taken directly from the Greek one. These additions are important as they show that the Romans had no symbols to represent the sounds of the letters and in Greek, which means that in these cases no known sound of Latin can be used to reconstruct the Greek sounds.\n\nLatin often wrote for Greek . This can be explained by the fact that Latin were pronounced as near-close , and therefore were as similar to the Ancient Greek mid vowels as to the Ancient Greek close vowels .\n\nSanskrit, Persian, and Armenian also provide evidence.\n\nThe quality of short is shown by some transcriptions between Ancient Greek and Sanskrit. Greek short was transcribed with Sanskrit long , not with Sanskrit short , which had a closer pronunciation: . Conversely, Sanskrit short was transcribed with Greek .\n\nThe Greek alphabet developed from the older Phoenician alphabet. It may be assumed that the Greeks tended to assign to each Phoenician letter that Greek sound which most closely resembled the Phoenician sound. But, as with loanwords, the interpretation is not straightforward.\n\nThe Greek alphabet was in turn the basis of other alphabets, notably the Etruscan and Coptic and later the Armenian, Gothic, and Cyrillic. Similar arguments can be derived in these cases as in the Phoenician-Greek case.\n\nFor example, in Cyrillic, the letter (\"ve\") stands for , confirming that beta was pronounced as a fricative by the 9th century AD, while the new letter (\"be\") was invented to note the sound . Conversely, in Gothic, the letter derived from beta stands for , so in the 4th century AD, beta may have still been a plosive in Greek although according to evidence from the Greek papyri of Egypt, beta as a stop had been generally replaced by beta as a voiced bilabial fricative by the first century AD.\n\nAny reconstruction of Ancient Greek needs to take into account how the sounds later developed towards Modern Greek, and how these changes could have occurred. In general, the changes between the reconstructed Ancient Greek and Modern Greek are assumed to be unproblematic in this respect by historical linguists, because all the relevant changes (spirantization, chain-shifts of long vowels towards , loss of initial , restructuring of vowel-length and accentuation systems, etc.) are of types that are cross-linguistically frequently attested and relatively easy to explain.\n\nSystematic relationships between sounds in Greek and sounds in other Indo-European languages are taken as strong evidence for reconstruction by historical linguists, because such relationships indicate that these sounds may go back to an inherited sound in the proto-language.\n\nUntil the 15th century (during the time of the Byzantine Greek Empire) ancient Greek texts were pronounced exactly like contemporary Greek when they were read aloud. From about 1486, various scholars (notably Antonio of Lebrixa, Girolamo Aleandro, and Aldus Manutius) judged that this pronunciation appeared to be inconsistent with the descriptions handed down by ancient grammarians, and suggested alternative pronunciations.\n\nJohann Reuchlin, the leading Greek scholar in the West around 1500, had taken his Greek learning from Byzantine émigré scholars, and continued to use the modern pronunciation. This pronunciation system was called into question by Desiderius Erasmus (1466–1536) who in 1528 published \"\", a philological treatise clothed in the form of a philosophical dialogue, in which he developed the idea of a historical reconstruction of ancient Latin and Greek pronunciation. The two models of pronunciation became soon known, after their principal proponents, as the \"Reuchlinian\" and the \"Erasmian\" system, or, after the characteristic vowel pronunciations, as the \"iotacist\" (or \"itacist\" ) and the \"etacist\" system, respectively.\n\nErasmus' reconstruction was based on a wide range of arguments, derived from the philological knowledge available at his time. In the main, he strove for a more regular correspondence of letters to sounds, assuming that different letters must have stood for different sounds, and same letters for same sounds. That led him, for instance, to posit that the various letters which in the iotacist system all denoted must have had different values, and that , , , , , were all diphthongs with a closing offglide. He also insisted on taking the accounts of ancient grammarians literally, for instance where they described vowels as being distinctively long and short, or the acute and circumflex accents as being clearly distinguished by pitch contours. In addition, he drew on evidence from word correspondences between Greek and Latin as well as some other European languages. Some of his arguments in this direction are, in hindsight, mistaken, because he naturally lacked much of the knowledge developed through later linguistic work. Thus, he could not distinguish between Latin-Greek word relations based on loans (e.g. — ') on the one hand, and those based on common descent from Indo-European (e.g. — ') on the other. He also fell victim to a few spurious relations due to mere accidental similarity (e.g. Greek 'to sacrifice' — French \"\", 'to kill'). In other areas, his arguments are of quite the same kind as those used by modern linguistics, e.g. where he argues on the basis of cross-dialectal correspondences within Greek that must have been a rather open \"e\"-sound, close to .\n\nErasmus also took great pains to assign to the members in his reconstructed system plausible phonetic values. This was no easy task, as contemporary grammatical theory lacked the rich and precise terminology to describe such values. In order to overcome that problem, Erasmus drew upon his knowledge of the sound repertoires of contemporary living languages, for instance likening his reconstructed to Scots \"a\" (), his reconstructed to Dutch ' (), and his reconstructed to French ' (at that time pronounced ).\n\nErasmus assigned to the Greek consonant letters , , the sounds of voiced plosives , , , while for the consonant letters , , and he advocated the use of fricatives , , as in Modern Greek (arguing, however, that this type of must have been different from that denoted by Latin ).\n\nThe reception of Erasmus' idea among his contemporaries was mixed. Most prominent among those scholars who resisted his move was Philipp Melanchthon, a student of Reuchlin's. Debate in humanist circles continued up into the 17th century, but the situation remained undecided for several centuries. (See Pronunciation of Ancient Greek in teaching.)\n\nA renewed interest in the issues of reconstructed pronunciation arose during the 19th century. On the one hand, the new science of historical linguistics, based on the method of comparative reconstruction, took a vivid interest in Greek. It soon established beyond any doubt that Greek was descended in parallel with many other languages from the common source of the Indo-European proto-language. This had important consequences for how its phonological system must be reconstructed. At the same time, continued work in philology and archeology was bringing to light an ever-growing corpus of non-standard, non-literary and non-classical Greek writings, e.g. inscriptions and later also papyri. These added considerably to what could be known about the development of the language. On the other hand, there was a revival of academic life in Greece after the establishment of the Greek state in 1830, and scholars in Greece were at first reluctant to accept the seemingly foreign idea that Greek should have been pronounced so differently from what they knew.\n\nComparative linguistics led to a picture of ancient Greek that more or less corroborated Erasmus' view, though with some modifications. It soon became clear, for instance, that the pattern of long and short vowels observed in Greek was mirrored in similar oppositions in other languages and thus had to be a common inheritance (see Ablaut); that Greek had to have been at some stage because it regularly corresponded to in all other Indo-European languages (cf. Gr. : Lat. '); that many instances of had earlier been (cf. Gr. : Lat. '); that Greek sometimes stood in words that had been lengthened from and therefore must have been pronounced at some stage (the same holds analogically for and , which must have been ), and so on. For the consonants, historical linguistics established the originally plosive nature of both the aspirates and the mediae , which were recognised to be a direct continuation of similar sounds in Indo-European (reconstructed and ). It was also recognised that the word-initial \"spiritus asper\" was most often a reflex of earlier (cf. Gr. : Lat. \"\"), which was believed to have been weakened to in pronunciation. Work was also done reconstructing the linguistic background to the rules of ancient Greek versification, especially in Homer, which shed important light on the phonology regarding syllable structure and accent. Scholars also described and explained the regularities in the development of consonants and vowels under processes of assimilation, reduplication, compensatory lengthening etc.\n\nWhile comparative linguistics could in this way firmly establish that a certain source state, roughly along the Erasmian model, had once obtained, and that significant changes had to have occurred later, during the development towards Modern Greek, the comparative method had less to say about the question \"when\" these changes took place. Erasmus had been eager to find a pronunciation system that corresponded most closely to the written letters, and it was now natural to assume that the reconstructed sound system was that which obtained at the time when Greek orthography was in its formative period. For a time, it was taken for granted that this would also have been the pronunciation valid for all the period of classical literature. However, it was perfectly possible that the pronunciation of the living language had begun to move on from that reconstructed system towards that of Modern Greek, possibly already quite early during antiquity.\n\nIn this context, the freshly emerging evidence from the non-standard inscriptions became of decisive importance. Critics of the Erasmian reconstruction drew attention to the systematic patterns of spelling mistakes made by scribes. These mistakes showed that scribes had trouble distinguishing between the orthographically correct spellings for certain words, for instance involving , , and . This provided evidence that these vowels had already begun to merge in the living speech of the period. While some scholars in Greece were quick to emphasise these findings in order to cast doubt on the Erasmian system as a whole, some western European scholars tended to downplay them, explaining early instances of such orthographical aberrations as either isolated exceptions or influences from non-Attic, non-standard dialects. The resulting debate, as it was conducted during the 19th century, finds its expression in, for instance, the works of and on the anti-Erasmian side, and of Friedrich Blass (1870) on the pro-Erasmian side.\n\nIt was not until the early 20th century and the work of G. Chatzidakis, a linguist often credited with having first introduced the methods of modern historical linguistics into the Greek academic establishment, that the validity of the comparative method and its reconstructions for Greek began to be widely accepted among Greek scholars too. The international consensus view that had been reached by the early and mid-20th century is represented in the works of and .\n\nSince the 1970s and 1980s, several scholars have attempted a systematic re-evaluation of the inscriptional and papyrological evidence (Smith 1972, Teodorsson 1974, 1977, 1978; Gignac 1976; Threatte 1980, summary in Horrocks 1999). According to their results, many of the relevant phonological changes can be dated fairly early, reaching well into the classical period, and the period of the Koiné can be characterised as one of very rapid phonological change. Many of the changes in vowel quality are now dated to some time between the 5th and the 1st centuries BC, while those in the consonants are assumed to have been completed by the 4th century AD. However, there is still considerable debate over precise dating, and it is still not clear to what degree, and for how long, different pronunciation systems would have persisted side by side within the Greek speech community. The resulting majority view today is that a phonological system roughly along Erasmian lines can still be assumed to have been valid for the period of classical Attic literature, but biblical and other post-classical Koine Greek is likely to have been spoken with a pronunciation that already approached that of Modern Greek in many crucial respects.\n\nRecently, there has been one attempt at a more radically revisionist, anti-Erasmian reconstruction, proposed by the theologian and philologist Chrys Caragounis, Professor Emeritus at Lund University (1995, 2004). On the basis of the inscriptional record, Caragounis dates virtually all relevant vowel changes into or before the early classical period. He relies heavily upon Threatte and Gignac for data from the papyri, but he provides little if any actual interaction with their own markedly different analyses of the very same historical data. He also argues for a very early fricative status of the aspirate and medial consonants, and casts doubt on the validity of the vowel-length and accent distinctions in the spoken language in general. These views are currently isolated within the field.\n\n\n\nAll speech consists of these categories: element [letter], syllable, conjunction, noun, verb, inflection, phrase.\n\nA letter is an indivisible sound — not any sound, but a sound from which a compound sound [syllable] can naturally be made, since the sounds of animals are also indivisible, and I call none of them a letter. The categories of sound are sounding [vowels], half-sounding [semivowels: fricatives and sonorants], and unsounded [silent or mute: stop].\n\nThese categories are the vowel, which has audible sound but no contact [between lips or between tongue and the inside of the mouth]; the semivowel, which has audible sound and contact (for example \"s\" and \"r\"); and the mute, which has contact and no sound by itself, becoming audible only with [letters] that have a sound (for example \"g\" and \"d\").\n\n[Letters] differ in the shape of the mouth and place [in the mouth], in thickness and thinness [aspiration and unaspiration], in length and shortness — and still more in sharpness and depth and middle [high and low pitch, and pitch between the two]: but theorizing about these things in detail is the job of those who study [poetic] meter.\n\nThere are 24 letters, from \"a\" to \"ō\"... Letters are also called elements [of speech] because they have an order and classification.\n\nOf these, seven are vowels: \"a, e, ē, i, o, y, ō\". They are called vowels because they form a complete sound by themselves.\n\nTwo of the vowels are long (\"ē\" and \"ō\"), two are short (\"e\" and \"o\"), and three are two-timed (\"a i y\"). They are called two-timed since they can be lengthened and shortened.\n\nFive are prefixable vowels: \"a, e, ē, o, ō\". They are called prefixable because they form a complete syllable when prefixed before \"i\" and \"y\": for instance, \"ai au\". Two are suffixable: \"i\" and \"y\". And \"y\" is sometimes prefixable before \"i\", as in \"myia\" and \"harpyia\".\n\nSix are diphthongs: \"ai au ei eu oi ou\".\n\nThe remaining seventeen letters are consonants [pronounced-with]: \"b, g, d, z, th, k, l, m, n, x, p, r, s, t, ph, kh, ps\". They are called consonants because they do not have a sound on their own, but they form a complete sound when arranged with vowels.\n\nOf these, eight are semivowels: \"z, x, ps, l, m, n, r, s\". They are called semivowels, because, though a little weaker than the vowels, they still sound pleasant in hummings and hissings.\n\nNine are mutes: \"b, g, d, k, p, t, th, ph, kh\". They are called mute, because, more than the others, they sound bad, just as we call a performer of tragedy who sounds bad \"voiceless\". Three of these are thin (\"k, p, t\"), three are thick (\"th, ph, kh\"), and three of them are middle [intermediate] (\"b, g, d\"). They are called middle, because they are thicker than the thin [mutes], but thinner than the thick [mutes]. And \"b\" is [the mute] between \"p\" and \"ph\", \"g\" between \"k\" and \"kh\", and \"d\" between \"th\" and \"t\".\n\nThe thick [mutes] alternate with the thin ones, \"ph\" with \"p\", as in [an example from the Odyssey]; \"kh\" with \"k\": [another example from the Odyssey]; \"th\" with \"t\": [an example from the Iliad].\n\nIn addition, three consonants are double: \"z, x, ps\". They are called double because each one of them is made up of two consonants: \"z\" from \"s\" and \"d\", \"x\" from \"k\" and \"s\", and \"ps\" from \"p\" and \"s\".\n\nThere are four unchangeable [consonants]: \"l, m, n, r\". They are called unchangeable because they do not change in the future [tense]s of verbs and in the declensions of nouns. They are also called liquids.\n\n"}
{"id": "6911444", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6911444", "title": "Austronesian peoples", "text": "Austronesian peoples\n\nThe Austronesian peoples, or more accurately Austronesian-speaking peoples, are a group of various peoples in Southeast Asia, Oceania and East Africa that speak Austronesian languages.\n\nThey include Taiwanese aborigines, the majority of ethnic groups in the Philippines, East Timor, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Polynesia, Micronesia and Madagascar, as well as the Malays of Singapore, the Polynesians of New Zealand and Hawaii, the non-Papuan peoples of Melanesia. All of these peoples can be connected through the Austronesian language family. They are also found in the regions of Southern Thailand, the Cham areas in Vietnam and Cambodia, and the Hainan island province of China, parts of Sri Lanka, southern Myanmar, the southern tip of South Africa, Suriname, and some of the Andaman Islands. On top of that, modern-era migration brought Austronesian-speaking people to the United States, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Hong Kong, Macau and Mauritius, as well as the West Asian countries. Ethnic Maldivians also possess a genetic connection to the Austronesian-speaking groups of maritime Southeast Asia via gene flow from the Malay Archipelago.\n\nThe nations and territories predominantly populated by Austronesian-speaking peoples are known collectively as Austronesia.\n\nArchaeological evidence demonstrates a technological connection between the farming cultures of the \"south\", meaning Southeast Asia and Melanesia, and sites that are first known from mainland China; whereas a combination of archaeological and linguistic evidence has been interpreted as supporting a \"northern\" origin for the Austronesian language family in mainland southern China and Taiwan.\n\nIt is theoretically possible that a few thousand years before the southward expansion of the Han dynasty that Austronesian speakers spread down the coast of southern China past Taiwan as far as the Gulf of Tonkin. In time, the spread of other language groups such as Austroasiatic, Tai-Kadai, Hmong-Mien and Sino-Tibetan (such as Chinese) led to the assimilation and eventual sinicization of all (proto) Austronesian-speaking populations that remained on the mainland (a process which continues today in Taiwan). In a recent treatment, all Austronesian languages were classified into 10 subfamilies, with all the extra-Formosan languages grouped in one subfamily and with representatives of the remaining nine known only in Taiwan. It has been argued that these patterns are best explained by dispersal of an agricultural people from Taiwan into insular Southeast Asia, Melanesia, and, ultimately, the remote Pacific. This model has been termed the \"express train to Polynesia\"— it is broadly consistent with available data , despite concerns that have been raised.\n\nAlternatives to this model posit an indigenous origin for the Austronesian languages in Southeast Asia or Melanesia.\n\nGenetic analyses suggest that the Southeast Asian Austronesians had spread over Sundaland (the land mass of Southeastern Asia before rising sea-level created the archipelago of Southeast Asia) and evolved \"in situ\" over the last 35,000 years. Nevertheless, in 2016, DNA analysis carried out found that one of the genetic markers used in the study but not the others supports a small-scale \"out-of-Taiwan\" hypothesis. The studies suggest that only a small fraction of the Taiwan genetic lineages are found among the people of South East Asia, and it is argued that these movements of people from Taiwan, while smaller in scale, had a strong impact on the culture and language of the people.\n\nGenomic analysis of cultivated coconut (\"Cocos nucifera\") has shed light on the movements of Austronesian peoples. By examining 10 microsatelite loci, researchers found that there are 2 genetically distinct subpopulations of coconut – one originating in the Indian Ocean, the other in the Pacific Ocean. However, there is evidence of admixture, the transfer of genetic material, between the two populations. Given that coconuts are ideally suited for ocean dispersal, it seems possible that individuals from one population could have floated to the other. However, the locations of the admixture events are limited to Madagascar and coastal east Africa and exclude the Seychelles and Mauritius. Sailing west from Maritime Southeast Asia in the Indian Ocean, the Austronesian peoples reached Madagascar by ca. 50–500 CE, and reached other parts thereafter. This forms a pattern that coincides with the known trade routes of Austronesian sailors. Additionally, there is a genetically distinct sub-population of coconuts on the eastern coast of South America which has undergone a genetic bottleneck resulting from a founder effect; however, its ancestral population is the pacific coconut, which suggests that Austronesian peoples may have sailed as far east as the Americas.\n\nAn element in the ancestry of Austronesian-speaking peoples, the one which carried their ancestral language, originated on the island of Taiwan. This occurred after the migration of pre-Austronesian-speaking peoples from continental Asia between approximately 10,000–6,000 BCE. Other research has suggested that, according to radiocarbon dates, Austronesians may have migrated from mainland China to Taiwan as late as 4000 BC (Dapenkeng culture). Before migrating to Taiwan, Austronesian speakers originated from the Neolithic cultures of Southeastern China, such as the Hemudu culture or the Liangzhu culture of the Yangtze River Delta.\n\nBased on recent archaeological evidence as well as linguistic evidence, Roger Blench (2014) considers the Austronesians in Taiwan to have been a melting pot of immigrants from various parts of the coast of eastern China that had been migrating to Taiwan by 4,000 B.P. These immigrants included people from the foxtail millet-cultivating Longshan culture of Shandong (with Longshan-type cultures found in southern Taiwan), the fishing-based Dapenkeng culture of coastal Fujian, and the Yuanshan culture of northernmost Taiwan which Blench suggests may have originated from the coast of Guangdong. Based on geography and cultural vocabulary, Blench believes that the Yuanshan people may have spoken Northeast Formosan languages. Thus, Blench believes that there is in fact no \"apical\" ancestor of Austronesian in the sense that there was no true single Proto-Austronesian language that gave rise to present-day Austronesian languages. Instead, multiple migrations of various pre-Austronesian peoples and languages from the Chinese mainland that were related but distinct came together to form what we now know as Austronesian in Taiwan. Hence, Blench considers the single-migration model to be inconsistent with both the archaeological and linguistic (lexical) evidence.\n\nTianlong Jiao (2007) notes that Neolithic peoples from the coast of southeastern China migrated to Taiwan from 6,500-5,000 B.P. The Neolithic period in southeastern China lasted from 6,500 B.P. until 3,500 B.P., and can be divided into the early (ca, 6500-5000 B.P.), middle (ca. 5000-4300 B.P.), and late (ca. 4300-3500 B.P.) Neolithic periods. The Neolithic in southeastern China started off with pottery, polished stone tools, and bone tools, with technology continuing to progress over the years. Neolithic peoples in Taiwan and mainland China continued to maintain regular contact with each other until 3,500 B.P., which was when bronze artefacts started to appear. Jiao (2013) notes the Neolithic appeared on the coast of Fujian around 6,000 B.P. During the Neolithic, the coast of Fujian had a low population density, with the population depending on mostly on fishing and hunting, alongside with limited agriculture.\n\nAccording to the mainstream \"out-of-Taiwan model\", a large-scale Austronesian expansion began around 3000–1500 BCE. Population growth primarily fuelled this migration. These first settlers may have landed in northern Luzon in the archipelago of the Philippines, intermingling with the earlier Australo-Melanesian population who had inhabited the islands since about 23,000 years earlier. Over the next thousand years, Austronesian peoples migrated southeast to the rest of the Philippines, and into the islands of the Celebes Sea, Borneo, and Indonesia. The Austronesian peoples of Maritime Southeast Asia sailed eastward, and spread to the islands of Melanesia and Micronesia between 1200 BCE and 500 CE, respectively. The Austronesian inhabitants that spread westward through Maritime Southeast Asia had reached some parts of mainland Southeast Asia, and later on Madagascar.\n\nSailing to Micronesia and the previously uninhabited islands of remote Oceania by 1000 BCE, the Austronesian peoples founded Polynesia. These people settled most of the Pacific Islands. They had settled Rapa Nui (Easter Island) by AD 300, Hawaii by AD 400, and into New Zealand by about 1280 CE. \nThere is evidence, based in the spreading of the sweet potato, that they reached South America where they traded with the Native Americans.\n\nIn the Indian Ocean they sailed west from Maritime Southeast Asia; the Austronesian peoples reached Madagascar by ca. 50–500 CE.\n\nThis \"out of Taiwan model\" has been challenged by a 2008 study. Examination of mitochondrial DNA lineages shows that they have been evolving within Island Southeast Asia (ISEA) for a longer period than previously believed. Population dispersals occurred at the same time as sea levels rose, which may have resulted in migrations to the Philippines as far north as Taiwan within the last 10,000 years. \nThe migrations were likely driven by climate change — the effects of the drowning the Sundaland subcontinent (which had extended the Asian landmass as far as Borneo and Java). This happened during the period 15,000 to 7,000 years ago following the Last Glacial Maximum. Rising sea levels in three massive pulses caused flooding and the partial submergence of the Sunda subcontinent, creating the Java and South China Seas and the thousands of islands that make up Indonesia and the Philippines today. Genetic evidence found in 2016 indicates that movements of people from Taiwan to the islands of South East Asia did occur, albeit smaller in scale, which nevertheless may have brought about linguistic and cultural changes.\n\nFindings from HUGO (Human Genome Organization) in 2009 also show that Asia was populated primarily through a single migration event out of Africa whereby an early population first entered South East Asia before they moved northwards to East Asia. They found genetic similarities between populations throughout Asia and an increase in genetic diversity from northern to southern latitudes. Although the Chinese population is very large, it has less variation than the smaller number of individuals living in South East Asia, because the Chinese expansion occurred very recently, following the development of rice agriculture — within only the last 10,000 years.\n\nBy the beginning of the first millennium CE, most of the Austronesian inhabitants in Maritime Southeast Asia began trading with India and China. The adoption of Hindu statecraft model allowed the creation of Indianized kingdoms such as Tarumanagara, Champa, Langkasuka, Melayu, Srivijaya, Medang Mataram, Majapahit, and Bali. Between the 5th to 15th century Hinduism and Buddhism were established as the main religion in the region.\n\nMuslim traders from the Arabian peninsula were thought to have brought Islam by the 10th century. Islam was established as the dominant religion in the Indonesian archipelago by the 16th century. The Austronesian inhabitants of Polynesia were unaffected by this cultural trade, and retained their indigenous culture in the Pacific region.\n\nKingdom of Larantuka in Flores, East Nusa Tenggara was the only Christian (Roman Catholic) indigenous kingdom in Indonesia and in Southeast Asia, with the first king named Lorenzo.\n\nWestern Europeans in search of spices and gold later colonized most of the Austronesian-speaking countries of the Asia-Pacific region, beginning from the 16th century with the Portuguese and Spanish colonization of some parts of Indonesia (present day East Timor), the Philippines, Palau, Guam, and the Mariana Islands; the Dutch colonization of the Indonesian archipelago; the British colonization of Malaysia and Oceania; the French colonization of French Polynesia; and later, the American governance of the Pacific.\n\nMeanwhile, the British, Germans, French, Americans, and Japanese began establishing spheres of influence within the Pacific Islands during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The Japanese later invaded most of Southeast Asia and some parts of the Pacific during World War II. The latter half of the 20th century initiated independence of modern-day Indonesia, Malaysia, East Timor and many of the Pacific Island nations, as well as the re-independence of the Philippines.\n\nAustronesian peoples consist of the following groupings by name and geographic location.\n\nAccording to a recent studies by Stanford University, there is wide variety of paternal ancestry among the Austronesian people, aside from European introgression found in Maritime Southeast Asia, Oceania, and Madagascar. They constitute the dominant ethnic group in the Malay Peninsula, Maritime Southeast Asia, Melanesia, Micronesia, Polynesia and Madagascar. An estimated 380,000,000 people living in these regions are of Austronesian descent.\n\nThe peoples constitute the dominant ethnic groups in Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, the Philippines, the southernmost part of Thailand and East Timor, together with Singapore. Outside this area, they inhabit Palau, Guam and the Northern Marianas, most of Madagascar, the Cham areas of Vietnam and Cambodia (the remnants of the Champa kingdom which covered central and southern Vietnam), and all countries in the Micronesian and Polynesian sphere of influence.\n\nThe native culture of Austronesia varies from region to region. The early Austronesian peoples considered the sea as the basic feature of their life. Following their diaspora to Southeast Asia and Oceania<nowiki>, they migrated by boat to other islands. Boats of different sizes and shapes have been found in every Austronesian culture, from Madagascar, Maritime Southeast Asia, to Polynesia, and have different names.\nIn Southeast Asia, head-hunting was restricted to the highlands as a result of warfare. Mummification is only found among the highland Austronesian Filipinos, and in some Indonesian groups in Celebes and Borneo.</nowiki>\n\nWith the possible exception of rongorongo on Easter Island, writing among pre-modern Austronesians was limited to the Indianized states and the sultanates of Maritime Southeast Asia. These systems included abugidas from the Brahmic family, such as Baybayin, the Javanese script, and Old Kawi, and abjads derived from the Arabic script such as Jawi.\n\nSince the 20th century, new scripts were mostly alphabets adapted from the Latin alphabet, as in the Hawaiian alphabet, Filipino alphabet, and Malay alphabet; however, several Formosan languages are written in zhuyin, and Cia-Cia off Sulawesi has experimented with hangul.\n\nBody art among Austronesian peoples is common, especially elaborate tattooing which has ancient origins. It is particularly prominent in Polynesian cultures, from where the word \"tattoo\" derives. But tattooing is also prominent among Austronesian groups in Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia.\n\nAmong the Māori of New Zealand, tattoos (\"moko\") were originally carved into the skin using bone chisels (\"uhi\") rather than through puncturing as in usual practice. In addition to being pigmented, the skin was also left raised into ridges of swirling patterns.\n\nIn the Philippines, the Spanish called the Filipinos they first encountered in the Visayas as the \"Pintados\", (\"the painted ones\" or \"the tattooed ones\") due to their practice of tattooing their entire bodies. Tattooing traditions were mostly lost as the natives of the islands converted to Christianity and Islam, though they were still practised in isolated groups in the highlands of Luzon and Mindanao. Philippine tattoos were usually geometric patterns or stylized depictions of animals, plants, and human figures. Some of the few remaining traditional tattoos in the Philippines are from elders of the Igorot peoples. Most of these were records of war exploits against the Japanese during World War II.\n\nDecorated jars and other forms of pottery are also common, with patterns often resembling those used in tattoos. Austronesian peoples living close to mainland Asia were also influenced by Chinese, Indian, and Arabic art forms.\n\nAustronesian Vernacular Stilt house is the native cultural houses of Austronesian people. Every Austronesian country has their own name and style for their own Austronesian houses. In the Philippines these are called Bahay kubo with many styles and variants, in Indonesia these are called Rumah adat also with many variants, and in Malaysia these are called Rumah Melayu which are also found in Indonesia and part of the Rumah Adat family.\n\nIndigenous religions were initially predominant. Mythologies vary by culture and geographical location, but are generally bound by the belief in an all-powerful divinity. Other beliefs such as ancestor worship, animism, and shamanism are also practiced. Currently, many of these beliefs have gradually been replaced. Examples of native religions include: Anito, Gabâ, Sunda Wiwitan, Kejawen, and the Māori religion. The moai of the Rapa Nui is another example since they are built to represent deceased ancestors.\n\nSoutheast Asian contact with India and China allowed the introduction of Hinduism and Buddhism. Later, Muslim traders introduced the Islamic faith between the periods of the 10th, and 13th century. The European Age of Discovery, brought Christianity to various parts of the region, including both New Zealand and Australia. Currently, the dominant religions are Christianity in the Philippines, much of eastern Indonesia, some parts of Indonesian Sumatra and Borneo, East Timor, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, most of the Pacific Islands, and Madagascar; Islam found in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, southern Thailand, the southern Philippines and Brunei; Hinduism in Singapore, Bali, and some parts of Indonesia, Malaysia and Philippines. There is also a tiny population in Manado on the island of Sulawesi who professed Judaism, most of whom either have Jewish ancestry who later mixed with the indigenous Minahasans or are converts.\n\nThe Austronesian music in Maritime Southeast Asia had a mixture of Chinese, Indian, and Arabic musical styles and sounds that had fused together with the indigenous Austronesian culture and music. In Indonesia, Gamelan, a type of orchestra that incorporates Xylophone and Metallophone elements, is widely used in its Hindu, Buddhist, and Islamic cultural tradition. In some parts of the southern, and northern Philippines, an Arabic gong-drum known as Kulintang, and a gong-chime known as Gangsa, is also used. The Austronesian music of Oceania have retained their indigenous Austronesian sounds. The Slit drums is an indigenous Austronesian musical instrument that were invented and used by the Southeast Asian-Austronesian, and Oceanic-Austronesian ethnic groups.\n\nGenetic studies have been done on the people and related groups. The Haplogroup O1 (Y-DNA)a-M119 genetic marker is frequently detected in Native Taiwanese, northern Philippines and Polynesians, as well as some people in Indonesia, Malaysia and non-Austronesian populations in southern China.\nA 2007 analysis of the DNA recovered from human remains in archeological sites of prehistoric peoples along the Yangtze River in China also shows high frequencies of Haplogroup O1 in the Neolithic Liangzhu culture, linking them to Austronesian and Tai-Kadai peoples. The Liangzhu culture existed in coastal areas around the mouth of the Yangtze. Haplogroup O1 was absent in other archeological sites inland. The authors of the study suggest that this may be evidence of two different human migration routes during the peopling of Eastern Asia; one coastal and the other inland, with little genetic flow between them.\n\nMitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analysis in 2008 suggests that the populations in the islands of South East Asia may have evolved \"in situ\" over the last 35,000 years, that they had already established themselves in the region before the Neolithic period, long before the Taiwanese people were proposed to have moved out of Taiwan into the region. Nevertheless, in 2016, DNA analysis carried out found that one of the genetic markers used in the study, haplogroup M7c3c, supports the \"out-of-Taiwan\" hypothesis, although not from the other genetic markers. Results from these studies suggest that there were movements of Neolithic people from Taiwan to the islands of South East Asia around 4,000 years ago, but they were small-scale affairs, with greater impact in the Philippines. \nThe fractions of Taiwanese Neolithic lineages present in the people of the islands of South East Asia today are estimated to range from 28% in the Philippines to 13.6% in Western Indonesia and 10.3% in Kalimantan. The authors argue that the cultural impact on the people was due to small-scale interactions and waves of acculturation, and that the Taiwanese migrants despite being smaller in numbers had a strong influence on the culture and language of the people as they were seen as an elite or associated with a new religion or philosophy. Some researchers have proposed a more complex pattern of settlement and dispersal, where the Austronesians were dispersed from mainland South East Asia via two routes: a northern route through Taiwan before they moved further down to the South East Asian islands, and a southern route through western Indonesia. Others have also found genetic links between the ancestors of Austronesians and people of North and South China.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8802515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8802515", "title": "Bisha'a", "text": "Bisha'a\n\nBisha'a or Bisha (ordeal by fire, trial by fire or fire test) is a ritual practiced by Bedouin tribes of the Judean, Negev and Sinai deserts for the purpose of lie detection. It is also practiced, and is said to have originated among, some Bedouin tribes of Saudi Arabia. It is the best-known of various forms of trial by ordeal which are practiced by the Bedouin, which are now dying out. It is one of the rituals in the Bedouin justice dispensary system for maintaining Sharaf - the Bedouin honor code.\n\nThe basic ritual consists of the accused being asked to lick a hot metal object (spoon, ladle, rod, etc.) thrice. He is provided with water for rinsing after the ceremony. He is then inspected by the official who presides over the ceremony - the \"Mubesha\" (or \"Mubasha\") and by the designated witnesses of the ritual. If the person undergoing the ritual is found to have a scarred or burnt tongue, it is concluded that he was lying. The Howeitat Bedouin call this ritual \"the true light of God\".\n\nThe Bisha'a is usually performed only to resolve the gravest of civil or criminal offences, and is a voluntary ritual in the sense that consent on the part of the ritual undergoer is required. Typically, Bisha'a is only performed for those cases where there are no witnesses regarding the disputed issue. Societal peer and hierarchy pressures may, however, force consent. In the case of the defendant agreeing to a Bisha'a ceremony, and subsequently declining to perform the ritual or running away, the defendant is considered guilty.\n\nThe ritual is usually a public affair, with both parties arriving with fanfare. Tea is often served. Women are allowed to participate in the occasion, unlike other judiciary hearings of the Bedouins.\n\nThe instrument of the ritual - typically a metal ladle called the \"tassa bil basha\" is heated up by sticking the ladle down into the flames, the convex side being pressed into the ashes. Gasoline is often poured on the metal to heat it up. In the absence of a ladle, other metal objects like knives, spoons and rods are also used, and use of non-metals like rocks have also been documented. Both parties recount their side of the story during the process of heating, with the Mubesha interrupting for clarification. The Mubesha can also summarize the events. When the Mubesha decides that the ladle is sufficiently heated, both parties swear to God that the issue will end with the ritual, and the defendant undertakes the test. In some variants, the claimant can lick the spoon before the defendant in a bid to worry the defendant (This rare variant is practiced by the Armilat Bedouin). The Mubesha then counts worry beads (possibly prayer beads), and after a suitable lapse of time, inspects the tongue of the person undergoing the ritual. He decides whether or not the tongue is burnt (or the degree of the burn in some cases), and relates his decision to the assembly. The defendant then shows his tongue to the witnesses for inspection.\n\nThe right to perform Bisha'a is granted only to the Mubesha, and this right is passed on from father to son, along paternal lineages. The Mubesha hears the account of the dispute before performing the ceremony, and is also responsible for pressing the metal spoon against the tongue of the person undergoing the Bisha'a. There are only a few practitioners of the Bisha'a in Bedouin society. A single Mubesha might arbitrate over several tribes and large geographical areas, like the Mubesha of Abu Sultan in Egypt.\nIn the Sinai Peninsula, Bisha's is widely used.\n\nThe legend behind the Bisha'a goes back to a man of great powers named \"Weymer abu Ayad\" of the \"Sultani\" branch of the Ayayideh tribe of the Qahtan confederation of Bedouins in southern Saudi Arabia. Many Mubesha claim to be able to trace their heritage to the tribe of Ayayideh. Weymer was a tracker but was robbed of a personal possession. He figured out the criminal, but there were no witnesses. Apparently, Weymer challenged the suspect to lick a red-hot branding iron three times which he would also lick three times, saying that the guilty would be shown. The suspect ran away.\n\nThe Bisha'a was illegal under British Mandate rule, though numerous accounts of the performance of the ritual are documented in the records of the Foreign Office The Bisha'a is illegal under the Israeli judicial system. It is also inconsistent with some interpretations of the Sharia, rules of Islam, being an old ritual passed on by Bedouins from pre-Islamic times. Most Arab states thus denounce the Bisha'a. The practice is getting rarer, with more and more Bedouins preferring standard courts of law for enactment of justice.\n\nThe Bisha'a has been variously described in ethnographic and cross-cultural studies. The earliest well-documented reports of the Bisha'a ceremony come from the accounts of Austin Kennett, Claude Jarvis and G. W. Murray. Later accounts of\nGlubb Pasha and Aref al-Aref also refer to the practice. Glubb Pasha's account mentions the high rate of correct judgement, which he attributes to the skill of the \"mubesha\". A quote from his account:\nIn practice, more than half the accused persons who set out to lick the spoon lose their nerve while the spoon is in the fire, and voluntarily confess to their guilt without blistering their tongues. A further twenty-five per cent probably blister their tongues, and twenty-five per cent are declared innocent. The efficiency of the process depends, of course, entirely on the skill of the “mubesha.” The days of the “true light of God” are doubtless numbered, and in the full glare of modern democracy and (doubtless) enlightenment, the little red-hot spoon will soon vanish. Before it does so, I cannot resist paying a tribute to the skill of those who practise this infamous superstition, and to the considerable number of miscarriages of justice which were by this means avoided.\nThe quasiscientific explanation of the ordeal is that stress would cause the mouth of liar to dry up, hence increasing the possibility of a burn. However, the stress of the ordeal could just as easily cause the same physical symptoms in an innocent person.\n\nRecent interest in the Bisha'a stems from two contemporary Israeli films which portray the Bisha'a - Yellow Asphalt (2001) and (2002).\n\nJoseph Ginat, Bedouin Bisha’h Justice: Ordeal by Fire (Sussex Academic Press, 2009)\n"}
{"id": "51328035", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51328035", "title": "Chronological dating", "text": "Chronological dating\n\nChronological dating, or simply dating, is the process of attributing to an object or event a date in the past, allowing such object or event to be located in a previously established chronology. This usually requires what is commonly known as a \"dating method\". Several dating methods exist, depending on different criteria and techniques, and some very well known examples of disciplines using such techniques are, for example, history, archaeology, geology, paleontology, astronomy and even forensic science, since in the latter it is sometimes necessary to investigate the moment in the past in which the death of a cadaver occurred.\n\nDating methods are most commonly classified following two criteria: relative dating and absolute dating.\n\nRelative dating methods are unable to determine the absolute age of an object or event, but can determine the impossibility of a particular event happening before or after another event of which the absolute date is well known. In this relative dating method, Latin terms \"ante quem\" and \"post quem\" are usually used to indicate both the oldest and the most recent possible moments when an event occurred or an artifact was left in a stratum. But this method is also useful in many other disciplines. Historians, for example, know that Shakespeare's play \"Henry V\" was not written before 1587 because Shakespeare's primary source for writing his play was the second edition of Raphael Holinshed's \"Chronicles\", not published until 1587. Thus, 1587 is the \"post quem\" dating of Shakespeare's play \"Henry V\". That means that the play was without fail written after (in Latin, \"post\") 1587.\n\nThe same inductive mechanism is applied in archaeology, geology and paleontology, by many ways. For example, in a stratum presenting difficulties or ambiguities to absolute dating, paleopalynology can be used as a relative referent by means of the study of the pollens found in the stratum. This is admitted because of the simple reason that some botanical species, whether extinct or not, are well known as belonging to a determined position in the scale of time.\n\nFor a non-exhaustive list of relative dating methods and relative dating applications used in geology, paleontology or archaeology, see the following:\n\n\nAbsolute dating methods, by using absolute referent criteria, mainly include the radiometric dating methods. Some examples of both radiometric and non-radiometric absolute dating methods are the following:\n\n\nSame as geologists or paleontologists, archaeologists are also brought to determine the age of ancient materials, but in their case, the areas of their studies are restricted to the history of both ancient and recent humans. Thus, to be considered as archaeological, the remains, objects or artifacts to be dated must be related to human activity. It is commonly assumed that if the remains or elements to be dated are older than the human species, the disciplines which study them are sciences such geology or paleontology, among some others.\n\nNevertheless, the range of time within archaeological dating can be enormous compared to the average lifespan of a singular human being. As an example Pinnacle Point's caves, in the southern coast of South Africa, provided evidence that marine resources (shellfish) have been regularly exploited by humans as of 170,000 years ago. On the other hand, remains as recent as a hundred years old can also be the target of archaeological dating methods. It was the case of an 18th-century sloop whose excavation was led in South Carolina (United States) in 1992. Thus, from the oldest to the youngest, all archaeological sites are likely to be dated by an appropriate method.\n\nDating material drawn from the archaeological record can be made by a direct study of an artifact, or may be deduced by association with materials found in the context the item is drawn from or inferred by its point of discovery in the sequence relative to datable contexts. Dating is carried out mainly post excavation, but to support good practice, some preliminary dating work called \"spot dating\" is usually run in tandem with excavation. Dating is very important in archaeology for constructing models of the past, as it relies on the integrity of dateable objects and samples. Many disciplines of archaeological science are concerned with dating evidence, but in practice several different dating techniques must be applied in some circumstances, thus dating evidence for much of an archaeological sequence recorded during excavation requires matching information from known absolute or some associated steps, with a careful study of stratigraphic relationships.\n\nIn addition, because of its particular relation with past human presence or past human activity, archaeology uses almost all the dating methods that it shares with the other sciences, but with some particular variations, like the following:\n\n\nSeriation is a relative dating method (see, above, the list of relative dating methods). An example of a practical application of seriation, is the comparison of the known style of artifacts such as stone tools or pottery.\n\n\nThe stratigraphy of an archaeological site can be used to date, or refine the date, of particular activities (\"contexts\") on that site. For example, if a context is sealed between two other contexts of known date, it can be inferred that the middle context must date to between those dates.\n\n"}
{"id": "4314229", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4314229", "title": "Churrigueresque", "text": "Churrigueresque\n\nChurrigueresque () refers to a Spanish Baroque style of elaborate sculptural architectural ornament which emerged as a manner of stucco decoration in Spain in the late 17th century and was used up to about 1750, marked by extreme, expressive and florid decorative detailing, normally found above the entrance on the main facade of a building. \n\nNamed after the architect and sculptor, José Benito de Churriguera (1665–1725), who was born in Madrid of a Catalan family (originally named Xoriguera), and who worked primarily in Madrid and Salamanca, the origins of the style are said to go back to an architect and sculptor named Alonso Cano, who designed the facade of the cathedral at Granada, in 1667.\n\nA distant, early 15th century precursor of the highly elaborate Churrigueresque style can be found in the Lombard Charterhouse of Pavia, yet the sculpture-encrusted facade still has the Italianate appeal to rational narrative. Churrigueresque appeals to the proliferative geometry, and has a more likely origin in the Moorish or Mudéjar architecture that still remained through south and central Spain. The interior stucco roofs of, for example the Alcázar de los Reyes Cristianos in Córdoba, Spain, flourish with detail and ornamentation.\n\nThe development of the style passed through three phases. Between 1680 and 1720, the Churriguera popularized Guarino Guarini's blend of Solomonic columns and composite order, known as \"supreme order\". Between 1720 and 1760, the Churrigueresque column, or estipite, in the shape of an inverted cone or obelisk, was established as a central element of ornamental decoration. The years from 1760 to 1780 saw a gradual shift of interest away from twisted movement and excessive ornamentation towards neoclassical balance and sobriety. \n\nAmong the highlights of the style, interiors of the Granada Charterhouse offer some of the most impressive combinations of space and light in 18th-century Europe. Integrating sculpture and architecture even more radically, Narciso Tomé achieved striking chiaroscuro effects in his \"Transparente\" for the Toledo Cathedral. Perhaps the most visually intoxicating form of the style was Mexican Churrigueresque, practised in the mid-18th century by Lorenzo Rodriguez, whose masterpiece is the Sagrario Metropolitano (1749–69) in Mexico City, New Spain.\n\nThe first of the Churriguera was José Benito de Churriguera (1665-1725), who trained as a joiner of altarpieces, drawing some very important for various churches of Salamanca, Madrid, Valladolid and other cities in Spain. Some in Spain have gone and some remain only a sites:\n\nIn Mexico, the Cathedral Basilica of Zacatecas, Zacatecas, capital of Zacatecas state, and the Templo de Santa Prisca, located in Taxco, Guerrero state are considered as masterpieces of Churrigueresque style. The building of Parroquia Antigua in Salamanca, Guanajuato, founded on August 24, 1603, was completed in the year 1690, and the Churrigueresque facade in 1740. The altarpiece of the church of San Francisco Javier (National Museum of Viceroyalty) in Tepotzotlán, State of Mexico is also considered, along with its facade, one of the most important baroque churrigueresque works created by the Jesuits in New Spain. The Altar de los Reyes of the Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral and the facades of the Sagrario Metropolitano, which is attached to the same Cathedral, are also representatives of the style.\n\nIt was late introduced in the Philippines. The best examples were the San Juan de dios Hospital in Intramuros, Daraga Church in Albay, and Tigbauan Church in Iloilo.\n\nThe Churrigueresque decorative style was used in Spanish Colonial architecture in the New World colonial town's important buildings. The style enjoyed a resurgence after architect Bertram Goodhue and Carleton Winslow Sr. studied Spanish Colonial Churrigueresque and Plateresque ornament in Mexico, using it in designing the 1915 Panama-California Exposition buildings at Balboa Park in San Diego, California. The Exposition popularized its use in Spanish Colonial Revival architecture styles in the United States.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7423263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7423263", "title": "Control reconfiguration", "text": "Control reconfiguration\n\nControl reconfiguration is an active approach in control theory to achieve fault-tolerant control for dynamic systems. It is used when severe faults, such as actuator or sensor outages, cause a break-up of the control loop, which must be restructured to prevent failure at the system level. In addition to loop restructuring, the controller parameters must be adjusted to accommodate changed plant dynamics. Control reconfiguration is a building block toward increasing the dependability of systems under feedback control.\n\nThe figure to the right shows a plant controlled by a controller in a standard control loop.\n\nThe nominal linear model of the plant is\n\nformula_1\n\nThe plant subject to a fault (indicated by a red arrow in the figure) is modelled in general by\n\nformula_2\n\nwhere the subscript formula_3 indicates that the system is faulty. This approach models multiplicative faults by modified system matrices. Specifically, actuator faults are represented by the new input matrix formula_4, sensor faults are represented by the output map formula_5, and internal plant faults are represented by the system matrix formula_6.\n\nThe upper part of the figure shows a supervisory loop consisting of \"fault detection and isolation\" (FDI) and \"reconfiguration\" which changes the loop by\n\n\nTo this end, the vectors of inputs and outputs contain \"all available signals\", not just those used by the controller in fault-free operation.\n\nAlternative scenarios can model faults as an additive external signal formula_9 influencing the state derivatives and outputs as follows:\n\nformula_10\n\nThe goal of reconfiguration is to keep the reconfigured control-loop performance sufficient for preventing plant shutdown. The following goals are distinguished:\n\n\nInternal stability of the reconfigured closed loop is usually the minimum requirement. The equilibrium recovery goal (also referred to as weak goal) refers to the steady-state output equilibrium which the reconfigured loop reaches after a given constant input. This equilibrium must equal the nominal equilibrium under the same input (as time tends to infinity). This goal ensures steady-state reference tracking after reconfiguration. The output trajectory recovery goal (also referred to as strong goal) is even stricter. It requires that the dynamic response to an input must equal the nominal response at all times. Further restrictions are imposed by the state trajectory recovery goal, which requires that the state trajectory be restored to the nominal case by the reconfiguration under any input.\n\nUsually a combination of goals is pursued in practice, such as the equilibrium-recovery goal with stability.\n\nThe question whether or not these or similar goals can be reached for specific faults is addressed by reconfigurability analysis.\n\nThis paradigm aims at keeping the nominal controller in the loop. To this end, a reconfiguration block can be placed between the faulty plant and the nominal controller. Together with the faulty plant, it forms the reconfigured plant. The reconfiguration block has to fulfill the requirement that the behaviour of the reconfigured plant matches the behaviour of the nominal, that is fault-free plant.\n\nIn linear model following, a formal feature of the nominal closed loop is attempted to be recovered. In the classical pseudo-inverse method, the closed loop system matrix formula_11 of a state-feedback control structure is used. The new controller formula_12 is found to approximate formula_13 in the sense of an induced matrix norm.\n\nIn perfect model following, a dynamic compensator is introduced to allow for the exact recovery of the complete loop behaviour under certain conditions.\n\nIn eigenstructure assignment, the nominal closed loop eigenvalues and eigenvectors (the eigenstructure) is recovered to the nominal case after a fault.\n\nOptimisation control schemes include: linear-quadratic regulator design (LQR), model predictive control (MPC) and eigenstructure assignment methods.\n\nSome probabilistic approaches have been developed.\n\nThere are learning automata, neural networks, etc.\n\nThe methods by which reconfiguration is achieved differ considerably. The following list gives an overview of mathematical approaches that are commonly used.\n\n\nPrior to control reconfiguration, it must be at least determined whether a fault has occurred (fault detection) and if so, which components are affected (fault isolation). Preferably, a model of the faulty plant should be provided (fault identification). These questions are addressed by fault diagnosis methods.\n\nFault accommodation is another common approach to achieve fault tolerance. In contrast to control reconfiguration, accommodation is limited to internal controller changes. The sets of signals manipulated and measured by the controller are fixed, which means that the loop cannot be restructured.\n\n"}

It is known for its pottery and handicrafts. The village name Dan Kwian means toll station or check point (\"Dan\") for oxcarts (\"Kwian\").\n\nDan Kwian sits at a narrows of the Mun (Thai: แม่น้ำมูล) river and was a convenient river crossing point. The river provided the means for distributing utilitarian pottery produced in Dan Kwian to a wide market. The village, located on the road connecting Nakhon Ratchasima and Chok Chai, is broken into two distinct parts. Dan Kwian Din Phao (ด่านเกวียนดินเผา), a congregation of larger factories and a roadside sales area for ceramics, both local and sourced from other centers in Thailand, is located about 2 kilometers north of the historic village Moo Baan Dan Kwian (หมู่บ้านด่านเกวียน). The Tambon covers a 10.17 km area. The people of Dan Kwian are mostly employed in handicrafts and farming.\n\nPottery production is said to have started around 1740, although this date has not been verified. The same account states that pottery production began with Mon (Thai: มอญ) refugees similar to the potters of Ko Kred (Kred Island). This claim, although popularly held, may not be accurate. \n\nPrior to approximately 1972 nearly all the products of Dan Kwian kilns were functional vessels. Common forms were water storage jars of around 50 liters capacity, lidded jars for preparing fermented fish, mortars, and basins. There is no evidence of tableware production at Dan Kwian. Most of the pottery is fired in above-ground anagama-style wood kilns, although at least one noborigama chamber kiln, many gas kilns, and at least one electric kiln have been used in recent years. Ceramic ware in Dan Kwian was traditionally fired in two distinct styles, Phao Dam (Thai:เผาดำ), or \"fired black,\" and Phao Deng (Thai:เผาแดง), \"fired red.\" Phao Dam ware was fired to temperatures between approximately and . The ware at this temperature became dark brown and vitreous. Phao Dam wares were prized for durability and lack of porosity. Most notable of these products are the once ubiquitous Dan Kwian water jars.\n\nStarting around 1972, decorative ware started to be made in Dan Kwian to serve a new market of urban consumers centered in Bangkok. University-based designers became involved with developing new products for hotels and other public spaces as well as private homes. At first this decorative ware consisted simply of water jars ornamented with carved decoration. Gradually the decorative ware expanded to include varied ornamental vessel forms, clay tile, carved ceramic murals, ceramic jewellery, and free-standing sculpture. Other media are also now produced in Dan Kwian, most notably cement-based carved sandstone replicas.\n"}

{"id": "23880983", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23880983", "title": "Draft Universe", "text": "Draft Universe\n\nThe Draft Universe () is a fictional setting for a science fiction duology written by Sergei Lukyanenko and consisting of the novels \"Rough Draft\" and \"Final Draft\".\n\nBesides our world, there exist alternate worlds whose development did not follow ours. All of these worlds are called the worlds of the Fan. Passages exist between these worlds, which are opened through the houses of customs officers-functionals, which often look like towers (at least most of the ones operated by males). Some of these worlds are inhabited, while others are devoid of human presence. However, it is possible that all worlds are inhabited. Initially, it is stated that there are only two dozen worlds. Later, though, it is revealed that the number is much higher.\n\nAll inhabited worlds feature a small percentage (about 1 in 20,000) of special people called functionals.\n\nFunctionals are people who have been \"erased\" from their lives and granted certain superhuman abilities, which work only within a certain area no more than 200 square kilometers (about 77 square miles). There is also a very small number of functionals who are not attached to a specific location. Usually, all abilities of a functional are directly linked to his or her function.\n\nFunctionals began to appear on our Earth in the 1810s.\n\nThe process of a human turning into a functional starts with everyone forgetting him or her, starting with random acquaintances and ending with immediate family members. This process can take anyone from two-three days to several weeks. The \"forgetting\" is not instantaneous. Other people will, at first, still recognize the future functional, albeit with some difficulty. Then they will get a sense of deja vu upon meeting him or her and, eventually, forget about the functional completely. At the same time, all official documents and records related to the person disappear, and most personal effects (ID, apartment/house keys, etc.) turn to dust. His or her house or apartment is occupied by other people who are convinced that they have always lived there. If the functional meets anyone during this period, the new acquaintance immediately forgets him or her upon departure.\n\nAt the end of this period, the new functional receives a message, inviting him or her to a certain place. The type of the message depends on the level of technology at the time. For example, in modern times, the functional gets a text message, while in the 1920s, one would get a telegram delivered by a postman-functional. Upon arriving to the specified location, the functional sees a house, which becomes his or her function (place of residence/work). The message is sent by a midwife-functional, whose function is to help the process of \"birthing\" new functionals.\n\nFunctionals have superhuman abilities related to their function as well as all the necessary knowledge. Some functionals (such as customs officers and police officers) are granted advanced physical abilities (superstrength and superspeed) and knowledge of martial arts, allowing them to easily defeat several well-trained humans. There are, however, not equal in combat abilities — while a customs officer is a superior combatant, even he or she is incapable of defeating a police officer.\n\nFunctionals do not age or get sick; they look younger than their biological age and are able to regenerate. A functional's regenerative ability is more advanced the closer he or she is to his or her function. Inside his or her function, a functional is nearly invulnerable (it is suggested that even beheading a functional inside his or her function would not kill him or her).\n\nThe functional's place of work/residence restructures itself in accordance with the functional's wishes. There are, however, limitations to this: the function will only create the bare minimum required for a more or less comfortable life. It will not create food, items of luxury, money or anything living.\n\nFunctionals are allowed (and, usually, welcome) to use the services of other functionals.\n\nA functional is tied to his or her function with a so-called \"leash\". A typical length of a \"leash\" is 10-11 kilometers (about 6.5 miles). While a functional is able to go beyond this radius, he or she loses all functional abilities. It should be noted that a functional's \"leash\" also extends to other worlds through customs. For example, if a functional lives 4 kilometers away from a customs office, he or she can only go 6-7 kilometers away from the customs office on another world.\n\nA functional is incapable of completely reject his or her function but can make his or her duties extremely easy (for example, a maid-functional whose hotel is never occupied).\n\nMost functionals have regular human jobs (doctor, restaurant owner, etc.). Their services are available to other functionals and the select humans who are aware of their existence. These humans are usually the social elite, such as politicians, moguls, artists, and others. The relations between the social elite and the functionals differ from world to world.\n\nPolice officer-functionals maintain order among the functionals. They are granted highly developed reasoning as well as combat abilities. Their function is not a specific place but a certain territory.\n\nCustoms officer-functionals operate the customs between worlds. They open doors to other worlds, let people through them and prevent the import and export of illegal goods. They also charge tariffs for certain items. All proceeds are kept by the customs officers. Only a customs officer is able to open doors in his or her function. They instinctively know everything the visitors are carrying and all the appropriate tariffs.\n\nMidwife-functionals help new functionals leave their lives behind and find their function. They are extremely powerful and are able to kill a human in another room by stopping his or her heart with a thought. They can also destroy a functional's function, which would usually kill the affected functional as well. Midwives are not tied to specific locations or territories; their function covers an entire world.\n\nCustoms are doorways to other worlds. The customs are operated by a customs officer-functional, the only person who is able to let others through the doors. A customs office is not dependent on the outside worlds and can only be destroyed by a thermonuclear warhead.\n\nThe ratio of customs officers to all functionals is surprisingly high. For example, Moscow has 17 customs officers for only 700 functionals.\n\nPassageways between worlds are usually limited to 2 square meters (i.e. the size of a door). It is extremely difficult to create a passageway that would allow a large object (such as a tank) to pass, while anything larger is physically impossible.\n\nThis world was long thought to be most similar to ours but historically ahead by 35 years. It was later discovered that, historically, Arkan is actually behind. However, in several areas, most notably in military technology, it is more advanced than Demos. Uses the other worlds as test sites for various experiments. For example, Demos is used as a platform for developing technology. However, this use of other worlds by Arkan led to its war with the world of Tverd, which was originally supposed to be the test site for the development of biotechnology. Arkan controls other worlds with the use of functionals. Geographically, Arkan is very similar to Demos.\n\nOur world. One of the most technologically advanced worlds in the Fan. Named so due to democracy being the prevailing form of government.\n\nA world without petroleum, which caused its technological development to stall (due to interference from Arkan) at the level of Demos in the 19th century (making Veroz an example of a steampunk world). Veroz fauna is also different from Demos fauna. For example, traveling the seas is dangerous, as krakens are real in this world. Also, there are nearly two dozen species of dinosaurs in existence in Africa. The generic shape of continents on Veroz is similar to Demos continents with some significant differences. For example, India is an island not a peninsula. Also, Veroz's complex political system is also radically different from ours. It includes elements of feudalism and democracy, while our version of democracy is seen as primitive. There are no nation-states on Veroz. While there are occasional alliances between the many city-states, they are usually fragile and do not survive the end of wars. As such, wars on Veroz would be seen by Demos inhabitants as nothing more than localized conflicts. Known cities: Kimgim in place of Stockholm, Orysultan in place of Moscow, and Zarhtan in place of Saint-Petersburg. Islam is a peaceful religion and is most prominent in Orysultan. Isa the Prophet is the Veroz version of Jesus Christ, with Christians being an aggressive religious minority.\n\nA world artificially stalled at the level of Ancient Greece (hence the name). Slavery is a major part of everyday life on Antik, with several major differences between slavery in Demos history. A master may not claim a slave's property for himself. This means that it is not uncommon for a slave to be wealthier than his master and have servants and concubines (but not slaves of his own). Twice a year, slaves are handed out weapons, so that they can rebel. If a slave succeeds, he trades places with his master.\n\nA friendly and attractive world, whose technological development is at the level of Demos in the 1950s. Its inhabitants are close to developing space travel. There is, however, a biological curiosity which makes the sociopolitical structure of Earth 5 very complicated — humans have a set mating season in spring, just like animals.\n\nA world dominated by the Catholic Church. While several nations do exist on Tverd, their governments handle the lower-level day-to-day management of their countries. The Church handles the theological and higher-level international issues. While the Church does exercise control over the entire world, they are so secure in their rule that they allow other religions to exist without persecution, including Islam, Judaism, and Orthodoxy, preferring to convince nonbelievers to convert through the use of philosophical debate rather than force. Tverd's level of development is mostly equal to the Late Medieval period of Demos history. The significant exceptions are the fields of biotechnology and genetics. Most devices and appliances are made from living things. For example, genetically modified medusae are used to create the Tverd equivalent of contact lenses, which can also be used to see certain wavelengths invisible to the naked eye (e.g. infrared). The Church has but one rule for genetic engineering: a human may not be modified in any way, as humans are made in the image of God. Other results of Tverd bioengineering efforts include Yorkshire Terriers able to leap many times their height into the air and kill a person within a few seconds, songbirds which act as biological recordings of songs, and flying gargoyles which act as the Church's air force. Tverd is the only well-known inhabited world that exists without interference from Arkan. Centuries ago, after the Church cardinals (the Church is ruled by the Cardinal Council instead of a single Pope) discovered the existence of functionals, they were systematically hunted down and eliminated in a manner similar to the witch-hunts of Demos during the Middle Ages. All known customs offices were immured, leaving one in Vatican, protected round-the-clock by female Swiss Guards and killer Yorkshire Terriers, to allow for diplomacy with the agents of Arkan. This customs office was also immured during the attempt by Arkan special forces to capture Kirill Maximov.\n\nThis world is only mentioned once throughout both novels. Humanity does not exist on Earth 12, its place having been taken over by giant hairy spiders.\n\nA world which is officially considered to be uninhabited. Later, it is discovered that Janus is populated by Stone Age-level humans. The geography of this world is unknown, but the climate is extremely harsh: furious winters and scorching summers. This is explained by the lack of sufficient solar energy (i.e. either the Sun is too far away, or it is weaker than ours).\n\nThe functional homeworld and, possibly, Demos's future. Less than 10% of the surface is habitable, and the remaining inhabitants of this once-prosperous world live on islands. The remaining 90% of the planet, including the mainlands, is covered by a volcanically-active radioactive wasteland. All customs that open to Earth 16 only open to the mainlands, ensuring that no one finds out the truth about this world (most functionals believe Earth 16 to be Hell). The only remaining sign of this worlds former greatness is a strange-looking skyscraper on an inhabited island, unseen to most humans. The structure is, actually, a museum and holds little value to functionals. It is protected by an angel-like functional.\n\nAn uninhabited world, although some believe that to be false. Used by functionals and some humans as a popular vacation spot.\n\nA world used by functionals as a prison of sorts. This is achieved using the naturally occurring fungus which produces spores that have a narcotic effect on humans. The spores can only exist on Nirvana. A settlement has been built by humans who have been sent to this world by functionals. The settlement is located close to two customs offices (one after Kirill's was destroyed). Vasilisa, a customs officer-functional, helps the inhabitants and teaches their children. The humans themselves are so used to the narcotic effect of the fungus, that they are incapable of leaving Nirvana without suffering severe withdrawal.\n\nAn unknown world, the existence of which is known only to the top functionals. It can be inferred that its level of technological development far exceeds all known worlds of the Fan. The humans of Earth 46 have advanced knowledge of quantum physics, putting them on the level with Earth 16 functionals. They are capable of building powerful combat robots, whose consciousnesses are copied from living or deceased humans. For example, on Earth 16, Kirill meets a robot from Earth 46, whose consciousness was copied from a poet named Anatol Lars, who was killed during the functional invasion of that world. On Earth 46, humans live in peace with the robots, and there are more of the latter. It is likely that robots are used as vessels for deceased humans who wish to live on in any form. After the functional invasion, Earth 46 was sealed forever from the rest of the Fan, preventing anyone from coming or leaving that world.\n\n\n"}

As a result, many states throughout the world where English is not the predominant language encourage or mandate the use of English as the normal medium of instruction.\n\nEducation is a provincial matter under the Canadian constitution, section 92. French language rights have been guaranteed in the province of Quebec since the Treaty of Paris 1763, French outside of Quebec and all other minority languages have faced laws against them at one time or another. English-only education laws were gradually rolled out across Canada during the nineteenth and twentieth century, culminating in the Manitoba Schools Question 1896 and Regulation 17 in Ontario in 1912, which both attacked French and other European minority languages, and the Indian residential schools system which attacked Aboriginal languages.\n\nThese policies were gradually abolished in the wake of Canada's adoption of official bilingualism (French/English) in 1969 and multiculturalism in 1971, but English remains the predominant language of education outside of Quebec and New Brunswick.\n\nThe Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542, passed by the Parliament of England, annexing Wales to the Kingdom of England are sometimes known as the \"Acts of Union.\"\n\nAn often quoted example of the effects on the Welsh language is the first section of the 1535 Act, which states: \"the people of the same dominion have and do daily use a speche nothing like ne consonant to the naturall mother tonge used within this Realme\" and then declares the intention \"utterly to extirpe alle and singular sinister usages and customs\" belonging to Wales.\n\nSection 20 of the 1535 Act makes English the only language of the law courts and that those who used Welsh would not be appointed to any public office in Wales: \nAn effect of this language clause was to lay the foundation for creating a thoroughly Anglicised ruling class of landed gentry in Wales, which would have many consequences.\n\nThe parts of the 1535 Act relating to language were definitively repealed only in 1993, by the Welsh Language Act 1993, though annotations on the Statute Law Database copy of the act reads that sections 18–21 were repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 1887.\n\nIn July 1846, the British Government appointed three commissioners to enquire into the state of education in Wales; the Commissioners were all monoglot English-speakers.\n\nThe Commissioners reported to the Government on 1 July 1847 in three large blue-bound volumes. This report quickly became known as \"Brad y Llyfrau Gleision\" (The Treachery of the Blue Books) as, apart from documenting the state of education in Wales, the Commissioners were also free with their comments disparaging the language, Non-conformity, and the morals of the Welsh people in general. An immediate effect of the report was for a belief to take root in the minds of ordinary people that the only way for Welsh people to get on in the world was through the medium of English, and an inferiority complex developed about the Welsh language whose effects have not yet been completely eradicated. The historian Professor Kenneth O. Morgan referred to the significance of the report and its consequences as \"the Glencoe and the Amritsar of Welsh history\".\n\nThe poet Edmund Spenser wrote in (1596) a recommendation that \"the Irish ... be educated in English, in grammar and in science ... for learning hath that wonderful power of itself that it can soften and temper the most stern and savage nature.\"\n\nThe setting up of 'Royal Schools' in Ireland, was proclaimed in 1608 by James I, with the intended purpose \"that there shall be one Free School at least appointed in every County, for the education of youth in learning and religion.\"\n\nThese schools provided an English-medium education to the sons of landed settlers in Ireland, most of whom were of Scottish or English descent.\n\nHowever, only five such schools were actually set up; The Royal School, Armagh in County Armagh, Portora Royal School in County Fermanagh, The Cavan Royal School in County Cavan, The Royal School Dungannon in Tyrone and The Royal and Prior School in County Donegal.\n\nThe \"National Education System\" (sic) was founded in 1831, by the British Government, under the direction of the Chief Secretary, E.G. Stanley. Some 2,500 national schools were established in Ulster in the period 1832–1870, built with the aid of the Commissioners of National Education and local trustees.\n\nProf. S. Ó Buachalla states:\n\nDuring the first four decades of their existence, there is no mention of the Irish language in the programme of regulations of the Commissioners of National Education; furthermore no provision whatsoever was made in 1831 when the original scheme was drawn up for education of those children who spoke Irish only. According to the official opinion of later Commissioners, expressed in a formal reply to the Chief Secretary in 1884, \" the anxiety of the promoters of the National Scheme was to encourage the cultivation of the English language.\n\nThe Irish patriot P.H. Pearse published a series of studies of the English-medium education system in Ireland. His article entitled The Murder Machine embodies an article which appeared in the Irish Review for February 1913.\n\nPearse wrote in his pamphlet the following:\n\nAnd English education in Ireland has seemed: to some like the bed of Procustes, the bed on which all men that passed that way must lie, be it never so big for them, be it never so small for them: the traveller for whom it was too large had his limbs stretched until he filled it; the traveller for whom it was too small had his limbs chopped off until he fitted into it—comfortably. It was a grim jest to play upon travellers. The English have done it to Irish children not by way of jest, but with a purpose. Our English-Irish systems took, and take, absolutely no cognisance of the differences between individuals, of the differences between localities, of the: differences between urban and rural communities, of the differences springing from a different ancestry, Gaelic or Anglo-Saxon.\n\nAttempts were made by legislation, in the later medieval and early modern period, to establish English at first among the aristocracy and increasingly amongst all ranks by education acts and parish schools. The Parliament of Scotland passed some ten such acts between 1494 and 1698.\n\nIn 1609 nine Gaelic chieftains were abducted and forced to sign the Statutes of Iona, which would seem to have been designed specifically to Anglicize leaders and institutions of Gaelic society, in order to bring it under control of central government.\n\nAmong the items listed in this agreement was the \"planting of the gospell among these rude, barbarous, and uncivill people\" by Protestant churches; the outlawing of bards who were traditionally on circuit between the houses of noblemen; the requirement that all men of wealth send their heirs to be educated in Lowland schools where they would be taught to \"speik, reid, and wryte Inglische.\"\n\nThe then King James VI, followed this by the School Establishment Act 1616, which sought to establish schools in every parish in the Scottish Highlands so that \"the youth be exercised and trayned up in civilitie, godlines, knawledge, and learning, that the vulgar Inglische toung be universallie plantit, and the Irische language, whilk is one of the chief and principall causes of the continewance of barbaritie and incivilitie amongis the inhabitantis of the Ilis and Heylandis, may be abolisheit and removeit.\"\n\nIn 1709 the Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian Knowledge (SSPCK) was established in order to further funding sources for Highland church schools. All manner of incentives and punishments were used to stop children from speaking Scottish Gaelic. The SSPCK had five schools by 1711, 25 by 1715, 176 by 1758 and 189 by 1808, by then with 13,000 pupils attending. At first the SSPCK avoided using the Gaelic language with the result that pupils ended up learning by rote without understanding what they were reading. In 1741 the SSPCK introduced a Gaelic-English vocabulary, then in 1766 brought in a New Testament with facing pages of Gaelic and English texts for both languages to be read alongside one another, with more success. After a number of years of unsuccessful attempts at English-only teaching methods, it was realized that literacy in Gaelic was a much more effective means of teaching and a bridge towards fluency in English.\n\nSince 1918 education acts have provided for teaching Gaelic in Gaelic-speaking areas, but development was very slow until Gaelic\nbecame an initial teaching medium in the Gaelic areas of Inverness-shire and Ross-shire from 1958. In 1975 the newly created Western Isles education authority introduced bilingual primary education shortly followed by Highland Region in Skye. Gaelic-medium primary education commenced with two schools in 1985, growing to 42 units by 1993/94.\n\nIn secondary education, Gaelic has long been taught as a subject—often through the medium of English, even to native speakers. A move towards bilingual secondary education in the Western Isles was frustrated by a change of government in the 1979 United Kingdom general election. Gaelic-medium secondary education has developed less satisfactorily. Gaelic-medium streams followed on from primary in Glasgow and Inverness, with some experimentation in the Western Isles, but the sector is hampered by acute teacher shortage, and an Ofsted inspectorate report of 1994 regarded Gaelic-medium secondary education as divisive and inappropriate.\n\nThird level provision through Gaelic is provided by Sabhal Mòr Ostaig (literally: \"the great barn at Ostaig\") a Gaelic-medium college based in Sleat, on the Isle of Skye in north west Scotland. It is part of the University of the Highlands and Islands, and also has a campus on Islay known as Ionad Chaluim Chille Ìle.\n\nIn 2004, Prince Charles, Duke of Rothesay, (who is patron of the College) stated that:\n\nThe beauty of Gaelic music and song is inescapable. But without the living language, it risks becoming an empty shell. That is why an education system, up to the level represented by the college here in Skye, is so important – to ensure fluency and literacy which will continue to renew the health and creativity of the language.\n\nThe Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005 is the first piece of legislation to give formal recognition to the Gaelic language in Scotland. It recognises Gaelic as an official language of Scotland, commanding \"equal respect\" with English.\n\nEducation Minister Peter Peacock, who has ministerial responsibility for Gaelic, said: \"This is a momentous day for Gaelic as we open a new chapter in the language's history. We have come a long way since the dark days of 1616 when an Act of Parliament ruled that Gaelic should be 'abolishit and removit' from Scotland.\"\n\n In the Prayer Book rebellion of 1549, where the English state sought to suppress Cornish language speaking with the introduction of the Book of Common Prayer, which was made available only in English. In replacing Latin with English, and under the guise of suppressing Catholicism, English was effectively imposed as the language of the Church, with the intent of it becoming the language of the people. At the time people in many areas of Cornwall did not speak or understand English.\n\nThe forced introduction of English to church services in Cornwall provided a major reason for the rebellion. The articles of the rebels states: \"and we the cornyshe men (whereof certen of vs vnderstande no Englysh) vtterly refuse thys new English.\"\n\nBritish records show that indigenous education was widespread in the 18th century, with a school for every temple, mosque or village in most regions of the country. Subjects taught included Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, Theology, Law, Astronomy, Metaphysics, Ethics, Medical Science and Religion. The schools were attended by students from all classes of society. Gandhi is said to have described the traditional educational system as a beautiful tree that was destroyed by British rule.\n\nThe Charter Act of 1813 decreed that English would be taught in the Indian education system although not as a replacement for indigenous languages. Instead, it was anticipated that English would co-exist with Oriental studies as a means by which moral law could be reinforced.\n\nThe 1817 publication of James Mill's \"History of British India\" proved to be a defining text in the theories of how education policies should be formed (ed. Horace Hayman Wilson: London, Piper, Stephenson and Spence, 1858). Mill advocated the introduction of European knowledge to counter balance Indian traits judged to be irrational. Instilling ideals of reason would accordingly 'reform' Indians by the example of Western systems of thought and outlook. His ideas discredited Indian culture, language and literature even as its assumptions of moral superiority authorised and justified the presence of the British in India.\n\nThe current system of education, was introduced and funded by the British in the 19th century, following recommendations by Thomas Babington Macaulay. Traditional structures were not recognized by the British government and have been on the decline since.\n\nThomas MacAulay's infamous 'Minute On Indian Education' (1835) encapsulates both the overt and covert agendas for such a policy.\n\nThe term 'Macaulay's Children' is used to refer to people born of Indian ancestry who adopt Western culture as a lifestyle. It is usually used in a derogatory fashion, and the connotation is one of disloyalty to one's country and one's heritage.\n\nThe passage to which the term refers is from his 'Minute on Indian Education' delivered in 1835. It reads:\n\nIt is impossible for us, with our limited means, to attempt to educate the body of the people. We must at present do our best to form a class who may be interpreters between us and the millions whom we govern; a class of persons, Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals, and in intellect. To that class we may leave it to refine the vernacular dialects of the country, to enrich those dialects with terms of science borrowed from the Western nomenclature, and to render them by degrees fit vehicles for conveying knowledge to the great mass of the population.\n\nIn 1835 Lord William Bentninck revitalised the earlier Charter Act with his New Education Policy which determined that English should be the official language of the courts, diplomacy and administration. Prior to this Persian had been the accepted language of diplomacy. Bentninck's motive was ostensibly to \"regenerate\" society, but the ramifications were boundless. From this moment on only those with Western style education and a knowledge of English were eligible for government employment or for a career in public life.\n\nIn 1854 Sir Charles Wood published his Education Dispatch which was aimed at widening the availability of Western oriented knowledge. Universities were established under the London examining model in Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras.\n\nLord Ripon's Hunter Commission of 1882 somewhat belatedly advocated that there should be increased provision of education at primary level and for women. The theory was that there would be a subsequent rise in the calibre of applicants for third level entry.\n\nThe inevitable result was that an Indian-based education was viewed as being second rate in comparison to an English-medium education.\n\nPrivate English medium schools are gaining popularity throughout India as urban middle class Indians who feel that English is the global language send their children to these schools. Increasingly, many poor families too are sending their children to English medium schools due the poor quality of education in Government run vernacular medium schools.\n\nUp until 1981 in West Malaysia (and some years later in East Malaysia), there were English-medium schools set up by the former British colonial government and Christian missionaries. However, following the implementation of the 1967 National Language Act which stipulated the conversion of all English-medium schools to Malay-medium schools; all English-medium schools were definitely phased out. The policy has now caused many newly graduates to become unemployed as they cannot find jobs especially in the private sector due to the lack of English proficiency; with the graduates can only depends on public sector jobs provided by the government. This led to a criticism over the policy by local governments from the East Malaysian sides who are now feel the impacts to their younger generations caused by the federal government policy who have been too long sidelined the importance to mastering the universal language of English. By 2016, Sarawak began to support the re-establishment of English-medium schools, and request for the approval of more English-medium schools in the state from the federal government using its autonomy in education. The move was followed by Sabah in 2017 when a minister from the state also urging the return of English-medium schools, which grows with more supports from other ministers.\n\nEnglish medium school in Indonesia consists of International school and National Plus school. A National Plus school in Indonesia refers to a school that offers education beyond the minimum requirements of the national Indonesian accreditation authorities. National Plus school offers some subjects taught in English and may provide some native English speakers on staff or may offer international curriculum such as from Cambridge International Examinations (CIE) or the International Baccalaureate Organisation (IBO).\nNational Plus schools can typically be differentiated from international schools by their core market. International schools tend to primarily exist to serve the needs of expatriate students and national plus schools for Indonesian students; however there is significant overlap on both sides.\n\nThe Government of Pakistan has recently announced the introduction of English lessons on a phased basis to all schools across the country. This new policy states that \"English language has been made compulsory from Class-1 onwards\" and the \"Introduction of English as medium of instruction for science, mathematics, computer science and other selected subjects like economics and geography in all schools in a graduated manner.\" Caretaker Minister for Education Mr. Shujaat Ali Beg declared 25 January 2008 that 18 colleges of the city of Karachi would be made \"Model English Medium Colleges,\"\n\nIn Bangladesh the system of education is divided into three different branches. Students are free to choose anyone of them provided that they have the means. These branches are: The English Medium, The Bengali Medium, and The Religious Branch. In the English Medium system, courses are all taught in English using English books with the exception for Bengali and Arabic. English medium schools are mainly private and thus traditionally were reserved for the upper and upper middle class. However huge demand in urban areas has resulted in large number of English-medium schools mushrooming. This has caused a fall in quality. O and A level exams are arranged through the British Council in Dhaka.\n\nIn the Union of Myanmar, the education system is based on the British Colonial model, due to nearly a century of British and Christian presences. Nearly all schools are government-operated, and also there has been a recent increase in privately funded English language schools.\n\nThe United States of America won the Philippine–American War (1898–1901), and declared the Philippines a US colony. US imperial rule followed. Mac Síomóin quotes the Filipino scholar E. San Juan who made the following comment regarding the use made by the US administration of the English language to rule his country:\n\nIts conquest of hegemony or consensual rule was literally accomplished through the deployment of English as the official medium of business, schooling and government. This pedagogical strategy was designed to cultivate an intelligencia, a middle stratum divorced from its roots in the plebeian masses, who would service the ideological apparatus of Anglo-Saxon supremacy. Americanization was mediated through English, sanctioned as the language of prestige and aspiration.\nEnglish is used for instruction at the University of the Philippines.\n\nUniversity of Ljubljana teaches at least 100 courses in English. In \"Where to Invade Next\", Michael Moore interviews several American citizens studying at the university who were taking courses taught in English.\n\nThe earliest European schools in South Africa were established in the Cape Colony in the late seventeenth century by Dutch Reformed Church elders committed to biblical instruction, which was necessary for church confirmation. In rural areas, itinerant teachers (meesters) taught basic literacy and math skills. British mission schools proliferated after 1799, when the first members of the London Missionary Society arrived in the Cape Colony.[8]\n\nLanguage soon became a sensitive issue in education. At least two dozen English-language schools operated in rural areas of the Cape Colony by 1827, but their presence rankled among devout Afrikaners, who considered the English language and curriculum irrelevant to rural life and Afrikaner values. Throughout the nineteenth century, Afrikaners resisted government policies aimed at the spread of the English language and British values, and many educated their children at home or in the churches.\n\nIn order to anglicize the Transvaal area during the Anglo Boer war, Lord Milner set out to influence British Education in the area for the English-speaking populations. He founded a series of schools known as the \"Milner Schools\" in South Africa. These schools consist of modern day Pretoria High School for Girls, Pretoria Boys High School, Potchefstroom High School for Boys, Hamilton Primary School, and St. Marys DSG.\n\nA number of universities are involved English-medium education by International Scholarly Exchange Curriculum program (ISEC program). ISEC program establishes a platform for those universities to communicate with other international institutions who use English-medium education. Other famous universities that offer English-medium education (China-Foreign cooperative universities), such as University of Nottingham Ningbo, China, United International College, Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Shanghai Newyork University and Wenzhou-Kean University.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "27564577", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27564577", "title": "Euphiction", "text": "Euphiction\n\n\"Euphiction\" is a writing genre where writers do literary \"cover versions\" of specific songs, a marriage of musical inspiration with the written word, or a story that works like a three-minute single. The word combines euphonious and fiction.\n\nTo write a euphictional story, writers select a song and either use the song's title or a lyric from the song as the title of the story, and then write a story that reflects the song itself. The goal of the piece is to create a literary cover of the song, by emulating the song's message or theme, or simply replicating the mood of the song in the story. The song's influence can be overt or cryptic, or the song can simply be recognized as a kind of soundtrack to the story. Some euphictional writers challenge themselves further by inserting as many of the lyrics from the song into the story. It must be stressed, however, that permission to use lyrics from the musician or band is paramount, especially if seriously considering the publication of the story.\n\nEuphiction is a form of flash fiction, where the maximum word count for the story is 1,000 words, not including the title. The imposed word limit helps to reflect the ephemeral nature of a song.\n\nEuphiction, as a writing genre, fits neatly into Warren Ellis' concept of burst culture. Euphictional pieces, like the songs that inspire them, are meant to be digested quickly and provide readers with satisfying narratives in bursts. And like music, collected euphiction can be shuffled (read in any order) and encourages repeat readings.\n\nThe term euphiction was originally used in \"Cover Stories: A Euphictional Anthology\", where ten writers each chose different albums and wrote ten stories based on the songs from the selected album. The book collected 100 euphictional stories inspired by the music of Combichrist, the Walkmen, By Hook or Crook, the Twilight Singers and others. The writers included in the anthology were Simon Neil, Derrek Carriveau, Christian A. Dumais (\"Empty Rooms Lonely Countries\"), T.P. Whited, Erik Schmidt, Suzi M. (\"Nemesis\"), A.C. Noia, Derek Handley (\"Introduction to the Japanese Language: Nihongo Ganbaroo\"), Matt Gamble and N. Pendleton (\"What Trees Have Done\"). An introduction was written by \"Freddie & Me\" creator Mike Dawson and an afterword by Florida Atlantic University Associate Director of Bands, Dr. Sean Murray. The anthology was collected and edited by Dumais.\n\nIn February 2010, N. Pendleton's Museioncast Volume 3, Episode 3: \"Six Euphictions\", which featured the music of Nest from their self-titled EP, was made available online. Pendleton imposed further restrictions to these euphictional pieces, such as no story could be longer than 500 words, no rewrites, and all six stories had to be recorded for the podcast in one take.\n\nThe first officially published euphictional piece was in issue 2 of Shock Totem Magazine, \"Leave Me the Way I was Found,\" written by Christian A. Dumais.\n"}

Its headquarters are in Miami, Florida, and it has a satellite office in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nFlava Works was founded in 1999 and is owned and operated by CEO Phillip Bleicher. It began with its \"CocoBoyz\" website showcasing African-American men in nude and erotic photos and videos. In 2000, Flava Works started \"Thugboy\", and a year later expanded with the creation of the \"CocoDorm.\" Flava Works moved its operations to Miami, Florida, in 2006 and continues to operate a satellite office in Chicago, Illinois. Flava Works' titles are available in Europe through a distribution partnership with XY Studios. In July/August 2008, FlavaWorks Cocodorm signed its FIRST white male model, named Snowflake, to sign a 5-year modeling contract to be featured on camera as their first white adult entertainment model and in January 2009, Flava Works announced its production and distribution partnership with RocaFellaz Entertainment. In April 2009, Flavaworks announced a distribution partnership with Black Rayne Productions. In May 2009, Flava Works signed its first white exclusive model.\n\nFlava Works operates several websites offering pornographic images and videos to its patrons including Cocodorm.com, PapiCock.com, ThugBoy.com, CocoBoyz.com, and FlavaMen.com. Thugsforsex.com is an online dating portal for black and Latin men. It has a chat room with video chat capabilities to its users. The CocoDorm is a live, interactive residence where models are hired to live together in a dorm-like environment. The \"Miami Herald\" described the operation as follows: \"CocoDorm offers its young, muscular males $1,200 a month along with free room and board while requiring they masturbate and have group sex in front of [web] cameras.\" Flava Works produces a quarterly magazine, \"FlavaMen\", which showcases the Flava Works models and contains editorials from contributing writers.\n\nIn May 2009, Flava Works announced that it was launching the FlavaMen Blatino Awards, which will honor ethnic clubs, adult performers, and websites in a variety of categories.\n\nIn 2006, a report surfaced from the Chicago Department of Public Health, which alleged that there was a high level of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV, among the models of the Cocodorm. Allegations were also made that the CocoDorm models were engaging in bareback sex. Flava Works denied the accusations contained in the report.\n\nOn May 8, 2007, NBC 6 aired a news investigation entitled \"The House Next Door.\" \n\nThe investigation surfaced when neighbors and zoning authorities were sent anonymous printed copies of webpages, a DVD of a sex show and of a fight that happened at the dorm, and photos of the red brick home.\n\nIn the documentary, models were shown half-dressed behind windows, and these images were juxtaposed with those of children playing in the street and unsuspecting neighbors being interviewed. The Miami Department of Code Enforcement visited the residence on May 8, 2007, and imposed five citations:\n\nOn August 13, 2007, and after \"three acrimonious public meetings … in sessions going past midnight, Miami's Code Enforcement Board ruled that Flava Works was \"illegally running an adult entertainment business out of a single-family home … and ordered that those operations cease.\n\nHowever, Flava Works filed a lawsuit against the City of Miami in response to the verdict, invoking First Amendment rights and arguing that it was not running an adult-oriented business out of the \"House Next Door.\" Flava Works also argued that business transactions do not take place in a residential neighborhood in Miami, but rather in virtual space. The case attracted some interest in legal circles.\n\nRuling on the case was made in January 2009, when Judge Marcia G. Cooke of the United States District Court, Southern District of Florida, Miami Division, ruled in favor of Flava Works. She based her judgment on the precedent of a very similar case involving a heterosexual porn site, \"Voyeur Dorm,\" operating webcams in a Tampa, Florida, residence. The judge ruling on the Voyeur Dorm case came to the conclusion that the residence provided no \"offer[ing] [of adult entertainment] to members of the public.\" The offering occurs when the videotaped images are dispersed over the internet and into the public eye for consumption \n\nCooke agreed, writing on the CocoDorm: \"Because the public offering by Flava Works, Inc. occurs via cocodorm.com in cyberspace, and not in a particular geographic location, the City of Miami zoning ordinance cannot be applied to the 503 residence. Furthermore,\n\nthe servers necessary to transmit the live and recoded video feeds to subscribers are not housed in either the 503 residence or the North Miami avenue business office. Here, although the performers are paid to be at the residence and captured on video, the processing and transmitting of the resulting images is done at a different location; a location not at issue in this case.\n\nCooke's decision was featured on NBC 6 on February 3, 2009, in a story entitled, \"Porn House Can Stay\". The report indicated that the City of Miami's intended to appeal the decision \n\nThe city appealed, and in June 2010 the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that regardless of whether the CocoDorm was an adult entertainment establishment, it was a business operation, and Miami zoning ordinances forbid operating a business in a residential zone. The court distinguished the Voyeur Dorm case by pointing out that the latter involved a Tampa ordinance against adult entertainment establishments, not business operations in general.\n\nIn 2010 Flava Works filed a lawsuit against Gunter who was operating myVidster.com claiming copyright and trademark infringement. This case became an important case in copyright law as it shows the boundaries of the safe harbour provisions in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. The case resulted in a preliminary injunction in favor of Flava Works.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "244543", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=244543", "title": "Frieza", "text": "Frieza\n\n, romanized as Freeza in Japanese merchandise, Funimation's English subtitles and Viz Media's release of the manga, is a fictional character in the \"Dragon Ball\" manga series created by Akira Toriyama. Frieza makes his debut in Chapter #247: , first published in \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\" magazine on October 6, 1989, as a galactic tyrant feared as the most powerful being in the universe.\n\nDespite not appearing until the manga's second half, Frieza is considered to be the most iconic antagonist from the \"Dragon Ball\" franchise due to effectively serving as the catalyst of many of the events depicted in the story, such as Goku's arrival on Earth, the Saiyans landing on Earth, and subsequently the main characters going to planet Namek. In his appearances in the manga itself, he is also directly responsible for the murder of Goku's father Bardock, the genocide of the Saiyan race, the death of Vegeta, and the second death of Goku's best friend Krillin, arguably making him Goku's most personal and significant enemy, and the final confrontation between Goku and Frieza has been hailed as one of the most memorable manga and anime battles ever.\n\nFrieza later appeared as the antagonist in the theatrical film \"\" and as an antagonist and recurring character in \"Dragon Ball Super\".\n\nFrieza, a broker who forcibly takes over planets to resell them, was created around the time of the Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators, whom Toriyama called the \"worst kind of people.\" Toriyama purposely does not draw bad guys so unscrupulous that it affects one psychologically, although he admits Frieza is close. Therefore, he paid special attention to how Frieza spoke; because villains typically speak rudely, he gave him polite speech making for an unsettling contrast with his cruelty. The character's name is a pun on freezer, and because of this the members of the Ginyu Force are named after items one would normally put in a refrigerator. The \"Shenlong Times\" issue #2, a bonus pamphlet given to some buyers of the \"Daizenshuu 2: Story Guide\" guidebook, says that Frieza was modeled after Toriyama's editor at the time, Yū Kondō.\n\nFrieza so far possesses five transformation forms, each one being quite different and more powerful from the previous ones. It is implied that Frieza's fourth form is actually his basic one, with the other three being transformations that suppress his power in order to conserve it, while the fifth one unleashes his true power. Toriyama revealed that he did not think to have Frieza transform until about midway through. He said he has a habit of making characters gradually more tough and complex-looking, until finally making them very sleek, as it is a pain to draw them if their appearance is too complex. The author confirmed this is why Frieza's third and most intricate form is only shown for a short time, and joked that three transformations might be one too many.\n\nBefore the start of the series, Frieza destroys Planet Vegeta, as Beerus asked him to do so, out of both fear of a potential uprising by the Saiyans due to their increasing power and the prophecy of the coming of the legendary Super Saiyan. Frieza spares only Vegeta, Nappa, and Raditz, offering them wealth for their loyalty. However, when Raditz's father made a final stand when Frieza destroyed Planet Vegeta, he did not notice the Saiyan's second son being sent to Earth where he became known as Goku.\n\nFrieza makes his official appearance in the story after Vegeta's defeat on Earth at Goku's hands, having traveled to Planet Namek to find the seven Namekian Dragon Balls to wish for immortality. He and his men massacre Namekian villages one after another, until Gohan, Krillin, and Vegeta begin to hamper his efforts in their own way. Though Frieza manages to gain the Dragon Balls, with the Ginyu Force dealing with the interlopers, his inability to speak Namekian forces him to find the Great Elder of Namek. Frieza ends up fighting Namekian warrior Nail, whom he beats repeatedly until Nail reveals that their fight was only to buy time for Dende to give the words needed to activate the Namekian Dragon Balls, for the warriors from Earth. With his entire army killed by Vegeta and the Ginyu Force defeated by Goku, Frieza intercepts Vegeta and the others personally.\n\nFrieza briefly battles Vegeta, with the Saiyan Prince goading him into transforming and revealing his true power. Frieza transforms into his second form, and during the battle he finally admits to be the one who had destroyed the planet where the Saiyans had settled. After defeating Vegeta, Frieza takes on Piccolo, who has at this point fused with Nail. Although Piccolo appears to be even with him, he transforms into his third form and dominates the powerful Namekian. Following a brief tussle with Gohan, Frieza decides to transform into his final form. He kills Dende to stop him from healing the others and mortally wounds Vegeta just as Goku arrives, who just recovered following his fight with the Ginyu Force. Frieza fights Goku and brutally beats him, however Goku manages to seriously wound him with a Genki-Dama. Frieza then critically injures Piccolo and murders Krillin, which sends Goku over the edge to assume Super Saiyan form for the first time.\n\nFrieza starts to realize that he is outmatched and damages the core of Namek in an act of desperation. He then uses 100% of his power (he had been using 50% up until that point), and regains the advantage, however he cannot sustain this form and is ultimately cut in half. Though Goku spares the crippled Frieza while leaving for his ship to escape the planet's destruction, he ends up seemingly killing Frieza when he makes a final attempt on Goku's life. But in reality, Frieza survives both the attack and Namek's explosion, drifting through space until he is found by his father and rebuilt with cybernetic prosthetics. A year later, Frieza and King Cold travel to Earth in order to exact revenge on Goku and his friends, but they are confronted by Trunks, Vegeta and Bulma's son from the future. After a brief battle, Frieza is sliced to pieces by Trunks and blasted into oblivion, with his father following shortly afterwards. Despite finally being dead, his cells are used as a catalyst for the future villain Cell.\n\nAfter Frieza's death, his spirit was kept imprisoned in Earth's Hell, where he was tortured by being forced to endure the playful antics of an overly saccharine cadre of angels while reliving the memories of his defeats at the hands of Goku and Trunks. But fourteen years after Frieza's demise, his two surviving subordinates Sorbet and Tagoma collected all of the Dragon Balls with the aid of the Pilaf Gang and resurrect him as his disemboweled Mecha Frieza form. The two bring Frieza to their ship and use their advanced medical technology to restore Frieza to full organic form. Bent on revenge while learning that Goku defeated Majin Buu and fought Beerus to a stalemate (the only two beings in the universe Frieza was warned never to cross by his father), Frieza decides to undergo four months of intensive training and achieves a new form which he dubs \"Golden Frieza\" and sets off for Earth with his army. On Earth, the Z Fighters battle Frieza's minions to stall for time so that Goku and Vegeta, off on a training session with the gods Whis and Beerus, can return. Frieza executes his defeated army for their incompetence just as Goku, Vegeta, Beerus, and Whis arrive. Goku and Vegeta reveal their new Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan forms, and battle Frieza, killing Sorbet in the crossfire. Although Frieza's Golden form is stronger than Goku's strongest form, Frieza's stamina can not endure a prolonged fight with this form, and he is eventually cornered by Vegeta. Frieza destroys the Earth in retaliation for his defeat, killing Vegeta while he survives, but Whis rewinds time and allows Goku to kill Frieza once more. Frieza returns to Hell, where he is once more tormented by the angels.\n\nIn the later story arc featuring the tournament between the 6th and 7th Universes, Frieza himself does not appear, however his Universe 6 counterpart Frost (フロスト, \"Furosuto\") makes an appearance as the second fighter on Team Universe 6. Frieza appears in the manga adaption omake alongside Sorbet and Susami in Hell.\n\nIn the Universal Tournament Arc, Frieza becomes the 10th member of the Universe 7 team after Majin Buu is ineligible to fight. When visited by Goku in Hell, later revealed to have mentally trained himself maintain his Golden form, Frieza accepts the offer on the condition of being revived by the Dragon Balls after the tournament. Universe 4 finds out about Frieza's enrollment into the Universe 7 team, and convinces Universe 9 to hire assassins to kill him as he is brought back to the living world by Fortuneteller Babba for 24 hours. Goku meets up with Frieza, but before they can meet up with the others they are stopped by a group of assassins that are claiming their heads. Frieza kills most of the assassins before trapping Goku in an energy attack, taking one of the assassin's communicators as he attempted to deal with Universe 9's leaders to join their group before being forced to destroy the item when Beerus and Whis appear. Beerus believes Frieza is plotting something, but Goku vouches for him and the two return to meet with the rest of their team. During the tournament, meeting Frost and setting up an alliance with him to take out the Saiyans, Frieza forces Universe 9's Roselle to forfeit and then easily disposes of Universe 10's Murichim. Frieza later spots Gohan struggling against Universe 2's Jimeze, eventually deciding to intervene and brutally defeats Jimeze. When Frost appears to commence their arrangement Frieza, revealed to tricked his Universe 6 counterpart, momentarily knocks Gohan out so he can eliminate Frost while his guard was down before aiding Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, and Androids 17 and 18 in defeating Universe 3's fighter. Frieza becomes one of the four combatants standing alongside Goku, Android 17 and Universe 11's Jiren, unexpectedly teaming up with Goku to force Jiren out in a triple elimination with 17 declared the winner. Frieza is resurrected soon after by Whis at the behest of Beerus as a reward for his efforts and take his leave to begin rebuilding his empire.\n\nShortly after the Tournament, Frieza will be teaming up with Vegeta and Goku to fight Broly in the film \"\".\n\nFrieza is capable of moving at superhuman speeds, flying, and has quick reflexes. Like most characters in the series, he can harness a supernatural energy known as \"Ki\" and manipulate it into powerful and devastating concussive beams of said energy, with which he is able to destroy planets with relative ease. Some of Frieza's signature \"ki\" techniques include the , a sharp piercing beam from his finger, and the , a large energy sphere he used to destroy planet Namek. He is capable of surviving in the vacuum of space, and also seems to possess some form of telekinesis, being able to lift opponents without touching them and cause them to explode.\n\nFrieza's power was so great over time, that his body could not comfortably contain it and a series of physical transformations were developed that limit his actual strength. While changing shape from his \"first-form\", each alteration builds on the previous. In all, Frieza has three transformed states, each with increasing power, some larger than others and each resulting in different physical attributes, although the two transformed states (along with his first form) were merely to suppress Frieza's power, and that his third transformed state is actually his true form, while a fourth further transformation that he discovered after his four months of training actually increases his power drastically and lets out most of his latent strength.\n\n\nIn his weakest form, Frieza is a relatively short humanoid with a large chestnut-shaped skull and two horns. He also has a tail with a spiked end, as well as having three talon-like toes. Frieza wears the same upper-body armor and shorts that many of his subordinates are shown to wear, and while traveling, often gives the appearance of weakness by exclusively using his hoverchair for transportation, leaving his henchmen to do his \"dirty work\". Though frail in comparison with his succeeding forms, Frieza still boasts sufficient force to destroy planets. While shifting to his next stage, Frieza breaks his battle-jacket, revealing a natural white armor covering his chest and shoulders.\n\nFrieza's 6th Universe counterpart, Frost, also initially appears in this form.\n\nHis second form is much larger, both in height and muscle mass. He grows longer horns, which now instead of protruding sideways from his head curve sharply upwards into near right angles. In this form, Frieza does not have any trouble taking out Vegeta, Krillin, and Gohan. However, Frieza notices that Piccolo's power level is about equal to his own level, leaving Frieza with no choice but to transform again. This form largely resembles his father, King Cold.\n\nFrieza's 6th Universe counterpart Frost also takes on a second form, however it bears a greater resemblance to Frieza's third form and is said to be the equivalent of it by Piccolo.\n\nFrieza's third form is again more brutish, with an extremely elongated skull (like an Alien). His facial features contort and change, with his nose melding into his mouth to form a crude beak. His original horns recede and are now white in color, erupting in pairs along the length of his head. His tail tip, which had been cut off by Kuririn, did not regenerate and he now has a slight hunch. Although his tail was surprisingly not regenerated, the rest of his wounds disappeared as if nothing ever touched him.\n\nDrastically differing from his previous transformations, in his final, true form, Frieza's third form (being more like a shell for this final form) cracks and shatters open, revealing a shorter and less bulky appearance. His horns and spikes disappear with his physique becoming entirely streamlined and his skin is now a pure, solid white with purple sections on his head, shoulders, forearms, chest and shins. All injuries taken in other forms are healed. This is the form that allows him to release his full potential. Frieza is also able to attain 100% power of this form, his muscle mass becoming engorged compared to his previously sleek frame. This is the peak of Frieza's natural potential, and the maximum amount of power his body can output. This form gives Frieza enough strength and speed to make even Super Saiyan Goku struggle; however to obtain such power, Frieza's body is subjected to a muscle strain, which slowly lowers his energy, reducing his speed until he cannot compete with Super Saiyan Goku anymore. This transformation is therefore not suitable for prolonged combat, with Frieza trying to finish the fight as quickly as possible by destroying Planet Namek.\n\nFrieza's 6th Universe counterpart, Frost, also briefly uses this form during the Tournament of Power.\n\nAfter being cut in half by his own attack and being caught in Namek's huge explosion, what remains of the still-living Frieza is salvaged and rebuilt with cybernetic enhancements by scientists under the order of King Cold; this form is referred to as in video games. The whole of the lower half of his body and right side of his face are replaced, as is his left arm from the shoulder down, with scarring and metal accoutrements covering what little was left of his organic self. It is stated that these enhancements have made him even more powerful. However, he was never able to unleash his full power in this form, since he was quickly destroyed by Trunks.\n\nFrieza attains another transformation in the 2015 film \"\" and \"Dragon Ball Super\". According to Frieza, his fifth transformation is achieved after undergoing intensive training for four months, enabling him to gain the strength to progress even further beyond his previous transformations by drawing out all of his latent power (as he had never trained a day in his life beforehand). In this form, Frieza's physique is similar to his previous fourth form except his skin is now a golden color as opposed to white, with purple sections on his head, chest, forearms and shins, thus he is known as in this form. In this form at peak power, Frieza is able to overpower Goku in his Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan form with relative ease. This form however, drains his energy much like when he used 100% of his power in his fourth form, due to him not training himself further to become accustomed to the form, and thus is also unsuitable for prolonged combat, as he soon finds himself unable to compete with Goku and Vegeta in their Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan forms. After his second revival, Frieza reveals he mastered his Golden form due to intense meditation while in hell. This \"True Golden Frieza\" can be used indefinitely without any drain on Frieza's stamina or even while he is barely conscious. Frieza's Japanese voice actor, Ryūsei Nakao jokingly placed Golden Frieza's power level at “one hundred quintillion” (or 1.2 billion times stronger than the Fourth form). In Dragon Ball Heroes there is a version of Golden Frieza called \"Rage Golden Frieza\" which is an empowered version of Golden Frieza fuelled by Rage which also appears in Super as well.\n\nIn the GT live action stage play, it shows Frieza had gain this transformation alongside Cell who escaped Hell and searching for Goku They easily beat Trunks but Pan tricks them into Searching Goku elsewhere.\n\nIn numerous filler episodes of the anime and \"Dragon Ball GT\", Frieza makes numerous cameo appearances, usually as comic relief, causing trouble in Hell, having somehow been permitted to keep his body despite his wrongdoings. In Hell, he is defeated and sent to prison by Goku and Pikkon along with Cell, his father and the Ginyu Force, and he is later seen watching Goku's final battle with Majin Buu in a crystal ball, comically hoping for Goku to lose. In \"\", Frieza briefly escapes from Hell with an army of villains to attack Earth, but he is swiftly defeated by Gohan. In \"Dragon Ball GT\", when Goku is sent to Hell by accident, Frieza and Cell confront him, their bodies having been rendered temporarily immortal due to the unbalance between the two worlds. Using a joint attack, Frieza and Cell send Goku to a lower level where he is frozen by a witch, but the two villains end up frozen themselves when they foolishly venture downwards to gloat at Goku. Goku accidentally breaks the ice holding Frieza and Cell and it shatters to pieces, implying that Frieza and Cell have been erased from existence. However, in a future scene, Frieza and Cell are seen being taken away in a jail cell with tape over their mouths and appear in the live action GT show where he and Cell gained new forms to track down Goku. He appeared in a TV ad for \"\", as he makes a non-speaking appearance in the film.\n\nHe also appears in a chapter of Toriyama's \"Neko Majin\" manga, published in August 2003, which also introduces Frieza's son, . He briefly appears in the 2006 \"Dragon Ball\" crossover chapter, , of Osamu Akimoto's manga \"Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari Kōen-mae Hashutsujo\". Frieza appears in Naho Ōishi's 2011 \"Dragon Ball\" spin-off manga \"\", but it predominately features his ancestor . He also appears in Toriyama's 2014 \"\" special.\n\nFrieza has made numerous appearances in other media. The Japanese nu metal/hardcore punk band Maximum the Hormone released the song \"F\" as part of a double A-side single on July 9, 2008. The entirety of the song references Frieza, with the single itself rising as high as number two on the Oricon music chart. The song was the source of reference used by Toriyama for the title of the film \"Fukkatsu no F\" and is featured in the movie. Seikima-II frontman Demon Kakka wrote and performed the song that appeared in two episodes of \"Dragon Ball Kai\" and on the 2009 \"Dragon Ball Kai Song Collection\" album.\n\nIn the manga \"Black Cat\", the character Sven Vollfied is often seen using his cell phone with a wrist strap of a miniature-sized badge of Frieza's head. A caricature of Frieza mixed with a grey alien was parodied as a mech pilot in an episode of \"Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi\". The anime \"Yakitate!! Japan\" featured a spoof re-enactment of the fight between Goku and Frieza, with a character clad in a refrigerator representing the latter. The Cartoon Network show \"\" had a parody of their own of the climactic fight and the Frieza character, with the Delightful Children From Down the Lane portraying him as a multi-headed monstrosity.\n\nFrieza has been featured in many of the video games based on the series. Often, he's both a playable character and boss, though more frequently the latter. He is also usually able to transform into his many different forms.\n\nFrieza appears in the Famicom game (and later Playdia remake) \"\". Frieza seems to be somehow resurrected, and he and other past villains start attacking Goku and his friends. Once it's revealed these are merely ghost-warriors meant to distract the heroes, however, the false Frieza and his allies are easily dealt with. Other games highlight Frieza in alternate story paths; including those where he successfully attains immortality and goes on to threaten Earth such as \"\", and \"\" where Frieza and Cell are resurrected and controlled by Bobbidi as a distraction for the player.\n\nFrieza also appears as a playable character in the crossover fighting games \"Jump Ultimate Stars\", \"Battle Stadium D.O.N\", and \"J-Stars Victory Vs\".\n\nIn the original Japanese version, Frieza is voiced by Ryūsei Nakao in all media.\n\nIn English, Frieza was voiced by Linda Young in the original Funimation dub of \"Dragon Ball Z\" and all subsequent media up until the first episode of \"Dragon Ball Z Kai\". He has since been voiced by Christopher Ayres in all media. Due to Ayres being diagnosed with end-stage COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and requiring a double lung transplant, he has since been voiced by his understudy Daman Mills. Following his treatment, Ayres returned to voice Frieza for the film \"\".\n\nYū Kondō, Toriyama's second editor from the Saiyan arc until the appearance of Perfect Cell, and Fuyuto Takeda, his third editor from Perfect Cell until the end of the series, said that \"Dragon Ball\" hit its peak in popularity during the Frieza arc. In a one-thousand ballot popularity poll held in \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\", \"Dragon Ball\" received 815 of them. In 2004, fans of the series voted Frieza the ninth most popular character for a poll in the book \"Dragon Ball Forever\".\n\nFrieza was mentioned as one of the \"most beloved characters\" in an article by \"GamePro\". The casting and direction of his English voices has often been criticized over the years, with IGN's Ramsey Isler writing that, coupled with the ambiguous physical features, the \"old lady\" voice lead to some gender confusion with fans. \"The Ledger\"'s December 8, 1999, paper, names him as one of the reasons that \"Dragon Ball Z\" was listed as a violent show for children stating, \"In one recent episode, beads of sweat form on the brow of a character named Vegeta, as he is nearly strangled to death by an evil foe named Frieza. In another, Frieza uses the horns on his head to impale a good guy named Kuririn through the chest.\" As well as opinions on his appearance: \"Little Gohan is abruptly in the icy metallic grip of one of his arch-nemeses [\"sic\"], Frieza, a silvery androgynous giant who looks like a cross between the monster in \"Alien\" and Batman's Mr. Freeze.\" \n\n"}

He is particularly associated with the starchy rhizome (\"aruhe\") of the \"Pteridium esculentum\" (\"rarauhe\"), which became a major element of the Māori diet in former times. He contrasts with his brother Rongo, the god of the kumara and all cultivated plants.\n\nIn different regional and tribal variations of the stories involving him, he is often a son or grandson of Rangi (Raki) and/or Papa.\n\nIn the Arawa version of the origin story, Haumia was a son of Rangi and Papa, and agreed to the forced separation of his parents. Because of this he was subjected to the fury of his brother Tāwhirimātea, god of winds and storms, who would have killed him if their mother had not hidden him in her body, that is, in the ground. While he escaped from Tāwhirimātea, he was later discovered by Tū, god of war (here representing humankind), who saw Haumia's hair (bracken fronds) sticking up out of the earth (Grey 1956:7-10, Orbell 1998:29, Tregear 1891:54).\n\nFood-quality rhizomes were only obtained from bracken growing in deep, moderately fertile soils. Bracken became abundant after the arrival of Māori, \"mainly a result of burning to create open landscapes for access and ease of travel\" (McGlone et al., 2005:1). Rhizomes were dug in early summer and dried for use in the winter. Although it was not liked as much as kumara, it was appreciated for its ready availability and the ease with which it could be stored (Orbell 1998:29).\n\nThe rhizomes were air-dried so that they could be stored and become lighter; for consumption, they were briefly heated and then softened with a\" patu aruhe\" (rhizome pounder); the starch could then be sucked from the fibres, or collected to be prepared for a larger feast. Several distinct styles of \"Patu aruhe\" were developed.\n\nThe plants of the bracken genus (\"Pteridium\") contain the known carcinogen ptaquiloside, identified to be responsible for haemorrhagic disease, as well as esophageal cancer, and gastric cancer in humans.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "28993191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28993191", "title": "Lamba (garment)", "text": "Lamba (garment)\n\nA lamba is the traditional garment worn by men and women that live in Madagascar. The textile, highly emblematic of Malagasy culture, consists of a rectangular length of cloth wrapped around the body.\n\nTraditional lambas used for burial were often made of silk and cow hides while those for daily wear were more often made of raffia, pig skin, cotton or bast. They could range in color from a tie-dyed mess or solid white cloth, to striped red, white and black cloth found in most parts of the island, the geometric patterns in unique shades of green and brown produced by a handful of Sakalava villages, or the brilliantly multi-colored, complex weaves favored by the pre-colonial Merina aristocracy. Today, it is common to find printed cotton or rayon lambas produced in India for the Malagasy market in addition to those fabricated locally.\n\nBesides its daily use as basic clothing, the lamba is also used for tying children to mothers' backs or as a cushion when carrying a heavy object on top of the head. The lamba is also used ritually to wrap the remains of the dead before placing them in the family tomb. Which after the ceremony are then \nplaced on the dead for an order of respect to their souls.\n\nThe term \"lamba\" is the name in the Highlands dialect of the woven cloth that traditionally formed the essential article of clothing throughout Madagascar. This garment is known by other words in various regions where other dialects are spoken; in some parts of the east, for instance, the garment is known by the word \"simbo\". Many of the ways in which the cloth may be wrapped around the wearer are specified by a wide variety of terms that vary from region to region. The color, print and type of cloth varies from region to region. The largest lambas (\"lambamena\") are made of a heavy white silk and are used to wrap the bodies of the deceased before placing them in the family tomb. Among some ethnic groups, lambas were also traditionally exchanged between a man and woman as part of their engagement ceremony, or as diplomatic gifts, as demonstrated by the two detailed silk \"lamba akotofahana\" (one multicolored, the other white-on-white) given in 1886 to President Grover Cleveland by Queen Ranavalona III on display at the Smithsonian National Museum of African Art.\n\nThere are numerous types of lambas produced in Madagascar. The names can serve to distinguish the material used, pattern type, ritual purpose of the garment or the intended wearer. Names of lambas vary from one region to the next according to local dialects, so the list below is not exhaustive but rather representative of some of the most commonly distinguishable types of lamba.It is many types in Madagascar\n\nA printed cotton lamba typically featuring a proverb on the lower border of the design, identical to the kangas worn throughout eastern Africa. The lambahoany is presently the most commonly worn type of lamba. These are traditionally made of printed cotton featuring a repeated border design that encloses either a secondary pattern (often around a central medallion) or a large image depicting a pastoral scene from daily life. A popular proverb, or \"ohabolana\", is typically written just above the center of the lower border. \nThe uses of the ubiquitous lambahoany are numerous and varied. They are often wrapped to attach an infant to its mother's back, freeing her hands for other uses. They may also serve as light blankets, sheets, an apron, a transport sack, a table cloth or a sunshade, and when tightly coiled they can be used as a cushion when carrying heavy objects on top of the head.\n\nA woven silk lamba featuring highly complex geometric designs.\n\nA ceremonial lamba traditionally worn by nobles, the wealthy, or elders.\n\nA silk burial shroud.\n\nA traditional lamba made of a blend of silk and cotton.\n\nA traditional lamba made of a blend of silk and raffia fibers.\n\nA traditional Sakalava raffia lamba commonly decorated with geometric ikat-dyed patterns and often used as a burial shroud.\nIt is still a tradition in Madagascar..\n\nA lamba worn as a loincloth, measuring about 30 cm wide and 300 cm long.\n\nThe style of wearing the lamba likewise varies between regions and according to the gender of the wearer. Both sexes will wrap it around the waist, much like a sarong. Women will also wear it wrapped over or beneath the bust to form a sheath dress, often with matching lamba headdress. These styles can be paired with a tank top or other light shirt.\n\nMen may drape the lamba over one shoulder as a shawl over shorts or – in cooler weather – over a \"malabary,\" a long-sleeved, knee-length cotton tunic. Traditionally, the lamba is draped over the left shoulder but is draped over the right when in mourning. Among mature Merina and (to a lesser extent) Betsileo women, wearing a narrower version of the traditionally white lamba around the shoulders is a mark of \"elegance, dignity, femininity and respect for tradition.\"\n\nNarrow lambas may be worn like a sash. Men drape them diagonally across the chest or knot them around the waist, while women may wear them loosely over the shoulders. The sash-like fashion was popularized due to European influence and is especially typical of the costume of hiragasy dancers.\n\nTraditional lambas were most often woven on horizontal ground looms, the most common type of loom found in Madagascar. The weaver was most often a woman and would be seated to one side of the loom as she worked the threads. For many women, weaving formed a basic domestic responsibility required to produce clothing for family members. Surplus could be sold to supplement family income; this occurred most often among the Merina and Betsileo of the Highlands.\n\nThe \"lamba akotofahana,\" the highly colorful lamba weaving style associated with the Merina aristocracy, consisted of complex geometric designs created by the uniquely Merina practice of using extra heddles across the loom to create raised bands of pattern. This striking statement of andriana class distinction in the imperial era was preserved in a toned-down form under colonial rule: the same intricate patterns were retained but the designs were woven in white-on-white to draw less attention to the statement of class and ethnic identity they made.\n\nIn recent years, the interest in (and demand for) traditional, highly-colored \"lamba akotofahana\" has increased among well-to-do Malagasy expatriates, tourists and textile aficionados, which has led to a resurgence in their production and sale in fine art galleries in Antananarivo. Contemporary artists have turned their attention to the resurrection of these ancient, half-forgotten techniques, producing unique works of art featured in exhibitions at internationally renowned museums. At the American Museum of Natural History, for instance, a \"lamba akotofahana\" was displayed that had been woven entirely from the silk threads produced by the female golden orb-weaver spider. A \"lamba akotofahana\" exhibiting the full range of colors and detailed patterns of the shawls worn by pre-colonial nobles, woven by artist Martin Rakotoarimanana, has likewise been recently displayed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\n"}
{"id": "39711200", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39711200", "title": "Masquerade in Mende culture", "text": "Masquerade in Mende culture\n\nPublic masquerades play an extremely significant role in the life of the Mende people - one of the two largest ethnic groups in Sierra Leone. \n\nArt historian Ruth Phillips writes that Mende masquerades \"are a means of mediating between the general community and the medicine societies that are central to Mende social life. Through masking performances, the public is kept informed of important events which occur in the private domain and is enabled to witness and to share in rituals that transform the status of relatives and friends. The masquerades make visible the powerful medicines (\"haleisa\", sing. \"hale\") of these sodalities without compromising their essential mystery. Maskers personify and dramatize the powers of the medicines and elicit ritualized gestures of respect and tribute from the spectators. At the same time participants and audience drawn into a common sphere of performance, aesthetically heightened by theater, music and dance.\" \n\nThe Mende define the visual features and performance of each masker in relation to a standard set of masquerades. The occasions for each masquerade are fixed according to an annual calendar of ritual and secular events and, within a single celebration, there is a carefully orchestrated sequence of masquerades.\n\n\"Hale\", meaning \"medicine,\" is believed to be a material substance found in nature that has powerful inherent properties that the officials of Mende secret societies know how to manipulate. These \"medicine societies\" are the men's Poro society, and women's Sande society, and \"hale\" can also refer to these.\n\nThe maskers of a medicine society embodies the spirit (\"ngafa\") as well as the power associated with its \"hale\"; the Mende refer to maskers by both of these terms. The standard set of Mende maskers includes about a dozen personalities embodying spirits of varying degrees of power and importance. The \"goboi\" and \"gbini\" of the Poro society, the \"sowei\" of the Sande society, and the \"njaye\" and \"humoi\" maskers belonging to the eponymous medicine societies.\n\nThe maskers of the Sande and Poro societies are responsible for enforcing laws and are important symbolic presences in the rituals of initiation and in public ceremonies that mark the coronations and funerals of chiefs and society officials. Another group of maskers, including the male \"gongoli\" and the female \"gonde\" and \"samawa\", are clownlike figures that feature in performances characterized by humor, satire and parody. These maskers are not true \"haleisia\", \n\n\"Gbini\" is considered to be the most powerful of all Mende maskers. \"Gbini\" appears at the final \"pulling\" ceremony of Poro initiation for a son of the paramount chief and also at the coronation of funeral of a paramount chief. Because of its power, women must stand far back from \"gbini\" and if a woman accidentally touches it, she must be anointed with medicine immediately. \n\n\"Gbini\" wears a large leopard skin which indicates its association with the paramount chief. The flat, round headpiece resembles the chief's crown. The headpiece is constructed of animal hide stretched over a bamboo framework. The hide is decorated with cowrie shells and black, white and red strips of cloth that are worked into a geometric pattern. At the center is a round mirror. Several flaps that are similarly decorated hang down from the base of the headpiece and overlap the raffia cape which covers much of the wearer's torso. \n\nThe Sande society is one of the most influential patrons of the visual arts in West Africa. The Sande \"sowei\" masquerades promote and represent the images of women in specific ritual and festive contexts. \n\nThe ceremonies of the Sande society are the only occasions in Africa in which women customarily wear masks. Wooden masks worn during these public ceremonies, such as funerals or the installations of chiefs, are called \"sowo\" (sing. \"sowei\") and represent the society's guardian spirit. The irreducible elements of sowei are a helmet form, lustrous blackness, beautifully arranged hair, downcast eyes, a closed mouth and an expression of inner spiritual concentration. The features of the mask illustrate the group's ideal of feminine beauty. The elegant hairstyles also symbolize the importance of social cooperation, since a woman needs the help of her friends to dress her hair. \n\nThe Mende honor outstanding carvers of sowei masks, which are typically men, with the name \"Sowo Gande\". According to Philips, the Sowo Gande demonstrates virtuosity through \"the triumphant conjuring of new forms which are recognizable variations of old forms.\" \n\nAccording to the Mende, \"hojo\"- white clay or kaolin- stands for the concept of the Sande society. Symbolically, it reflects a lot of the characteristics the Sande treasure, such as purity and elusiveness.

Jaycee Chan, Jackie Chan's son, will share the role as young Yue Fei. Jackie Chan said, “There's already a rough draft right now, we've even found a co-star. In fact, filming of \"Genghis Khan\" is also under consideration, but it must be a good script, because a lot of people have filmed this story, and the story itself is complicated and randomized, so up to now, there isn't a concrete plan yet. And [the script for] \"Yue Fei\" is nearly completed.\" He continues, \"I think Yue Fei is a man with great sense of loyalty, so am I. I've been loyal to Golden Harvest, to friends and to my country!\" Filming will not begin until Chan finishes filming several other projects (including \"Rush Hour 3\"), but he is willing to work for reduced pay so he can work with his son. This is because he believes the box office results will be good. However, director Stanley Tong says the role of Yue Fei could possibly go to Andy Lau.\n\n\n\nNew Tang Dynasty Television (NTDTV) has produced a Chinese opera-style reenactment of \"Shuo Yue Quanzhuan\" called \"The Loyalty of Yue Fei\" as part of the \"Chinese New Year Spectacular\". The play begins with Yue Fei and his sworn brothers practicing martial arts. When the Jin dynasty's general Wushu invades the Southern Song Dynasty, Yue Fei is torn between duty to his country and duty to his mother. The production plays heavy on the strong relationship between mother and son. According to actor Wang Xuejun, who portrays the title character of Yue Fei, \"Some people said that when they first saw Yue Fei's mother come out [to give Yue his famous tattoo], and the smoke rising they were moved to tears.\" He continues, \"Yue Fei excels both as a scholar and a martial artist — wise as well as courageous. I use that as the inner temperament for my character to embody.\" The \"Spectacular\" is scheduled for a 28 city world tour across the United States, Canada, Australia, Germany, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and France in 2007.\n\nA Yue Fei card set was sold as part of five famous Chinese warriors — Guan Yu, Hua Mulan, Jie the Tyrant, Sun Tzu, and Yue Fei — in the \"Chinese\" section of the second set of world cultures produced by the Anachronism boardgame in June 2005. In July 2005, the card pack was used for a promotional offer where a person would receive it or a Robin Hood card pack if they sent in the UPC labels off of three warrior packs (from any culture) or one warrior and one starter set. In April 2006, the player could send in the UPC's of four warrior packs or two warrior packs and one starter to choose between promotional cards from sets two and three, which consisted of Yue Fei, Robin Hood, Siegfried or Black Hawk. However, with the release of the sixth set in August 2006, the Yue Fei and Robin Hood packs were no longer available.\n\nOut of the Five Chinese Elements used to describe warrior attributes, Yue Fei is listed under water, which represents intelligence. He has eight life points, one speed point, three experience points, and one damage point. The main self-titled Yue Fei card (left) is the 46th card out the 100 produced for set two. The other four cards that make up the entire pack (#46-50/100) show various events from his life and military career. Card 47, titled \"Jin Cheng Bao Guo\", depicts his mother giving him his famous tattoo on his back. Card 48, titled \"Dao\", shows Yue blocking a Jurchen soldier's spear attack with a Chinese broadsword. Card 49, titled \"Hu Xiong Jia\", depicts Yue using his armor's breastplate to deflect the spear attack of a Jurchen soldier, while simultaneously snapping the weapon's pole arm with a palm strike. Card 50, titled \"Ba Duan Jin\", depicts Yue teaching his soldiers the Eight Section Brocade qigong exercise that is often attributed to the general.\n\nIndependent gameplayers have produced a mod of Yue Fei from \"Sangokushi Sousouden\".\n\nYue Fei is one of the 32 historical figures who appear as special characters in the video game \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI\" by Koei.\n\n\"Shuo Yue Quanzhuan\" is a favorite among \"Pingshu\" (評書) or \"Pinghua\" (評話) storytellers, which is a modern-day form of \"Shuoshu\" (說書) storytelling that became popular in the Tang and Song dynasties. One of the most famous of these artists is Liu Lanfang (b. 1944), a noted singer and actress. She first made a name for herself in 1972 when she sang the full-length script of \"Shuo Yue Quanzhuan\". In September 1981, the \"Chunfeng Literature Publishing House\" published the 100-chapter pingshu script of Yue Fei's tale.\n\nAccording to \"You Er Hua Bao\" (幼兒畫報; \"Children's Pictorial Magazine\"), a Chinese magazine tailored for children ages two through seven, the young Yue Fei purchased a bow, a sword, and a spear to practice martial arts on his own since he did not have a teacher to train him properly. One day when he was chopping firewood, he passed by a village with a martial training hall ran by a famous master. Yue Fei immediately asked the master to become his student, not even knowing that this person was none other than Zhou Tong. Zhou told the boy, \"Your skill in martial arts is inadequate, so you must first train your eyes.\"\n\nAs a part of his training, Yue Fei began to stare directly into the morning sunrise. At first the training was hard because the bright sunlight hurt his eyes, but he continued to practice the skill of the \"far-sighted person\" for many years. One day, Zhou came to Yue Fei and pointed to an object high up in the sky. When he focused his trained vision, Yue saw that it was a lone goose. Zhou then directed Yue to scan some trees that were one hundred paces away. Yue again focused his vision and caught sight of two black cicadas on a tree. Zhou then laughed in approval and said \"Now that your eyesight is practiced, I not only accept you as my student, but also as my adopted son. I will now teach you martial arts.\"\n\nYue Fei practiced diligently and became a master of the eighteen weapons of war. He could draw a bow weighing 300 catties and, with a \"whiz\" of the arrow, shoot a leaf from 100 paces away. The moral of the story is that achievements are only made through diligent practice. It also warns that staring directly into the sun is very dangerous and could permanently damage the eyes.\n\nWhen Yue Fei was born, there was a red auspicious glow around the Yue family residence so neighbors brought buckets of water to put out some perceived fire. However, they found out that Lady Yue had given birth to a son. With all the people crowded around their house, a Peng landed on the roof and spread its wings over the length of the entire residence. The bird then flew high into the sky and disappeared. The sight of the Chinese roc is why Yue's father named him \"Fei\" (飛; \"fly\").\n\nDays after his birth, a monk warned Yue Fei's father to put his wife and newborn child inside of a water tank if the baby were to cry. Three days later, the baby began to cry, so Yue's father followed the monk's instructions. Then the Yellow River flooded and mother and child were swept to safety, whereas Yue's father drowned in the torrent. In his previous life, Yue had indeed been a Peng himself. He had blinded the eye of a mischievous dragon living within the Yellow River. So when the dragon heard his newly reborn enemy cry, he flooded the river to kill Yue and get his revenge, but failed.\n\nLady Yue raised Yue Fei on money that she saved up from doing sewing for the family who had saved them from the river and taken them into their home. When Yue Fei was 13, he entered a cave and found a monstrous snake sleeping by a stream. He picked up a rock and threw it at the beast. The snake lunged at him in anger, but Yue Fei dodged to one side and pulled on its tail with his supernatural strength. The snake instantly disappeared in a puff of smoke, leaving only a marvelous golden spear named the \"Magic Spear of the Flowing Spring\" (). He later found a military teacher who taught him how to wield the spear efficiently.\n\nYue eventually joined the army and became one of the most beloved heroes and martyrs in Chinese history. This story is a derivative of an episode from his fictional biography \"Shuo Yue Quanzhuan\".\n\nAfter Yue Fei's execution, iron statues of Qin Hui, the man responsible for the general's execution; his wife Madam Wang; and two other accomplices were cast in iron and knelt outside Yue's memorial tomb as punishment for their deeds. During the Ming Dynasty, the new Provincial Governor-General of Hangzhou, who was a direct descendant of Qin Hui and Madam Wang, had both iron statues thrown into the West Lake under cover of night. The next day, the lake turned pitch-black and stank of vomit. The townsfolk realized that the lake's condition coincided with the statues' disappearance. When the Governor-General arrived on the scene, the people questioned him about his relationship with Qin Hui. As he knew the statues had sunk to the bottom of the lake, he boasted, \"If anyone can really scoop the statues out of the lake, I'm waiting to resign and ask for punishment.\" At that exact moment, the murky water became clear and the statues drifted ashore as if propelled by an invisible force. The cowardly Governor-General bolted for his carriage when he saw this miraculous sight. The townsfolk pelted his carriage with rocks as he fled, many of them ripping through the curtain, giving him huge lumps on his head. That night, the Governor-General escaped from Hangzhou, never to be heard from again. Listen to this story\n\nDuring the Southern Song Dynasty there were two famous Buddhists named the \"Crazy Monk\" Ji Gong and the \"Mad Monk\" Fengbo. Fengbo lived during the time of Yue Fei and became famous for \"sweeping Qin Hui's face with a broom\". The story is told after having Yue Fei imprisoned on false charges, Qin Hui went to Lingyin Temple to have his fortune read. There he was confronted by a laughing Fengbo who asked, \"Cao Cao was once a big hero, but where is he today?\" Qin Hui asked him what he meant in confusion. Fengbo said, \"The principles of Heaven are clear. Loyalty and treachery are self-evident. Goodness and evil will be met with reward or retribution. You, as the Prime Minister, hold a lot of power. Why do you want to murder a man who is as important to the country as a pillar is to a house? Does the safety of the nation mean nothing to you?\" Qin countered \"Who is that pillar of the country?\" \"General Yue Fei!\" screamed Fengbo. When Qin Hui seemed unaffected by his words, Fengbo laughed and said, \"What a fool! Repent now before it is too late.\" He then grabbed a broom and raked it across Qin Hui's face and quickly ran off. Feeling embarrassed, Qin returned to the palace a defeated man.\nThe boldness of the monk caught the attention of the common folk. It is said he would appear in crowded areas and begin to sweep the floor, even in the cleanest of places, and proclaim \"sweeping Qin\" as a reminder to the people that they should band together to eliminate the traitor Qin Hui from office. The \"Mad Monk\" was later raised to the status of an arhat.\n\nThe statues of the \"Mad and Crazy Monks\" were often seen together in various temples throughout the Southern Song Dynasty. There are two such statues of these arhats in the Daxiong Temple Hall of Zhantan Forest on Mount Jiuhua. One of them is the \"Crazy Monk\" Ji Gong in the form of a deity and the other is the \"Mad Monk\" Fengbo holding a duster in one hand and a broom under his left armpit, standing ever ready to give the wicked Prime Minister another sweep.\n\nThis is a derivative of an episode from \"Shuo Yue Quanzhuan\", which mentions no \"sweeping\" at all. The fortuneteller's name was \"Xie Renfu of Chengdu\" and he told the fortunes of both Emperor Gaozong and Qin Hui, who were in disguise, in the Dragon's Intonation Monastery. When Qin returned to the palace he sent men to arrest the fortuneteller, but he had fled the city out of fear once he discovered who they really were.\n\n"}

Until 2001 it was called the Museum of Ethnology (\"Museum für Völkerkunde\").\n\nIt was founded in 1904, as a civic institution, to bring together the ethnographic collections of the city of Frankfurt. In 1908 the museum moved into the Palais Thurn und Taxis in the city centre. In 1925 the city acquired the collections of the Institute of Cultural Morphology (today the Frobenius Institute), founded by the ethnologist Leo Frobenius. He relocated to Frankfurt along with the institute and become an honorary professor of the University of Frankfurt. In 1934 he became the director of the museum. The roles of museum director and institute director continued to be occupied by the same person (including Frobenius's successors) until 1966, when the university became state-run, since when the museum has again been run by the city.\n\nSignificant parts of the collection were lost when the Palais was destroyed by bombs in World War II. However, some items had already been evacuated from the Palais – these survived the war, and in 1973 they were put on display in an old villa on the banks of the Main, where they have been ever since.

In addition to being a compilation of open educational resources (OER), NDLA provides a range of other online tools for sharing and cooperation. The legal liability for the joint county programme is carried by Hordaland County Council.\n\nNDLA does not take on its own employees, but manages co-workers within the county resource system, as well as co-workers from private sector.\nCore activities are organised in teams: Subject material development, technical development, applications management, content management, NDLA interactive, and desk support.\n\nIn 2006 The Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research allocated NOK 50 mill for the development of digital learning resources for subjects in secondary education. Among the targets was the intention to enhance the access to and use of digital learning resources in secondary education, and increase the volume and the variety of such resources. Increased volume and diversity were seen as significant conditions for the introduction of free learning material in upper secondary education. The incentive was an amendment imposing the counties to provide free educational material, in print as well as digital, including digital hardware.\n\n20 September 2006 the county chief executives of education agreed to establish a joint project to develop digital subject material for all subjects in secondary education. The project was named Norwegian Digital Learning Arena (NDLA). The preliminary project work started early 2007; all counties except Oslo were parts of the collaboration. The first year the project was fully funded by the Ministry of Education and Research, and on 26 September Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg officially opened Norwegian Digital Learning Arena. The academic year 2008–2009 subject material for Norwegian, natural science, and health and social care, first year course, was published.\n\nThe 18 participating counties took over the further funding of the project, and for the academic year 2009–2010 digital subject material was provided for 17 curricula and more than 30 subject areas. The extent increases by the year and by school start in 2014 subject material covering approximately 40 curricula and 60 subject areas within upper secondary education is available.\n\nIn 2013 Akershus County decided to withdraw from the project, however, the county resumed its participation from January 2014.\n\nThe number of visits to the digital learning resources on ndla.no has been rising since the start of the project. Based on ratings by Google Analytics the figures are:\n\nOslo County does not take part in the NDLA project, but is the county with most visits and use of the resources on ndla.no. In 2013 there were 1 139 129 visits from Oslo.\n\nMost of the available NDLA material is licensed by Creative Commons license and is free to use. All the material is noted with competence aims based on the official data from the Norwegian Directorate for Education and Training. By the start of academic year 2014 teaching material within the following subjects and subject areas are available:\n\nIn addition to the open digital learning resources NDLA provides a series of net-based tools for sharing and cooperation on net. Some of these are:\n\nNDLA cooperates with Khan Academy for translation and organising pages, Norwegian subtitles of videos, Norwegian framework and Norwegian tasks. In addition NDLA has cooperation with the PhET project at the University of Colorado, providing simulations in HTML5 as well as translation and organising of the two forms of Norwegian.\n\nNDLA is developed in the publishing system Drupal 6. The solution was initially created by the developing group Utdanning.no, but further development and operation now lies with the Cerpus group. The core code of the system is open source software; open for anyone aiming to develop digital learning resources. In 2018 NDLA will relaunch on a new technological platform. \n\nIn 2011 NDLA was nominated for European Public Service Award (EPSA). The prize is awarded annually within the EU/EEC area, the ambition is to develop and improve solutions within public and civil administration. NDLA was candidate for the prize with the entry: NDLA Innovation in Acquisition, Development and Distribution of Digital Learning Resources. A total of 274 initiatives were evaluated, and 15 candidates were shortlisted for the prize.\nIn 2014 NDLA won the Boldic Award for its open and innovative web repository at ndla.no. In the jury statement, it was pointed out that NDLA's project strategy and solutions can be scalable across the Nordic and Baltic countries, and that NDLA provides a unique way of working together to promote distance learning and ICT-supported flexible lifelong learning.\nIn 2017 NDLA won the Open Educational Resources Awards for best OER Site.\n\nThe NDLA learning resources are continually evaluated by independent third parties. An external users’ study from 2013 revealed that NDLA was mostly used as supplement to a traditional textbook, and the use was largely managed by the teacher. Students pointed out e-lectures and differentiated tasks as most useful. Both teachers and students emphasized the value of the possibility to differentiate material and tasks designed for students with varying learning capability.\n\nBy publicly inviting tenders NDLA searches the market for digital learning resources to cover the competence aims of the different subject areas. NDLA asks for production services, developing groups of digital learning material, for either parts of, or prospective total solutions for a complete curriculum.\n\nThe responsibility for the editorial work, organising, meta-tagging, and putting together the material in the respective subject areas lies with competent editing groups recruited from upper secondary schools in the counties. The contents of each site are quality controlled by academy and university expertise, or otherwise specialists in that particular field. All the core material is published in the two forms of Norwegian.\n\nWhen the demand is not met by the supply, the editing groups will produce their own material. The publishing companies are invited to collaborate in every round of purchase, and are free to make an offer of their material that will benefit their interests.\n\nThe basic income of NDLA rests on a joint contribution from the part-taking counties, of NOK 400, - per student, which constitutes an annual income of estimated NOK 64 mill. In 2013 this figure was lower due to Akershus’ leaving the project. 66% of NDLA’s net expenses in 2013 were spent on purchase in the market.\n\nIn 2010 NDLA was indicted by the Norwegian Publishers' Association before the European Surveillance Authority (ESA). The publishers claimed that the state funding of more than NOK 150 mill did not comply with the international regulation of financial state support, and represented an obstacle to the establishing of a free market for digital learning resources.\n\nThe indictment was initially rejected by the EFTA Surveillance Authority on 12 October 2011, but in December 2012 the dismissal was set aside by the EFTA Court after an appeal from the Publishers’ Association. In March 2013 the EFTA Court announced a formal investigation of the funding of NDLA, and ESA reopened the case. After a close examination ESA reached the same conclusion; the funding of NDLA is in compliance with the rules of state funding.\n"}

There are about 70 speakers on Pitcairn Island, Britain's last remaining colony in the South Pacific.\n\nFollowing the Mutiny on the Bounty on April 28, 1789, the British mutineers stopped at Tahiti and took eighteen Polynesians, mostly women, to remote Pitcairn Island and settled there. Initially, the Tahitians spoke little English, and the \"Bounty\" crewmen knew even less Tahitian.

Her book \"A Year of Biblical Womanhood\" was on \"The New York Times\" e-book non-fiction best-seller list.\n\nEvans was born to Peter and Robin Held. She grew up in Birmingham, Alabama. At age 14, she and her family moved to Dayton, Tennessee, where her father took an administrative position at Bryan College. She attended Rhea County High School and then went to Bryan College where she majored in English literature. She received her Bachelor of Arts degree in 2003 and married her college boyfriend, Dan Evans, that year. They moved to Chattanooga, Tennessee, where she worked as an intern for the \"Chattanooga Times Free Press\".\n\nIn 2004, Evans returned to Dayton where she worked full-time for the local paper, \"The Herald-News\". In 2006, she transitioned from full-time to writing pro bono as the paper's humor columnist; in 2007, she won an award for \"Best Personal Humor Column\" from the Tennessee Press Association. She continued to write freelance articles for national publications and started a blog.\n\nIn September 2008, Evans signed with Zondervan for her first book, \"Evolving in Monkey Town\". The book explores her journey from religious certainty to a faith which accepts doubt and questioning; the title is based on the Scopes Monkey Trial that occurred in Dayton. Her second book, \"A Year of Biblical Womanhood: How a Liberated Woman Found Herself Sitting on Her Roof, Covering Her Head, and Calling Her Husband Master\", was released in October 2012. She recounts how she spent an entire year of living a Biblical lifestyle literally. The book also garnered national media attention for Evans as she appeared on \"The Today Show\". In 2014, Evans re-released \"Evolving in Monkey Town\" with the new title of \"Faith Unraveled\".\n\nIn 2015, she wrote a column in \"The Washington Post\" that was entitled: \"Want millennials back in the pews? Stop trying to make church 'cool'”. In the column she self-identified as a millennial, and expressed her belief that while churches in the United States are attempting to get more millennials in the church, their approach is wrong because they focus primarily on stylistic aspects, which she believes \"are not the key to drawing millennials back to God in a lasting and meaningful way. Young people don’t simply want a better show.\" She believes that while the church is acting in good faith in their efforts to bring millennials back to the church, they too frequently use misguided strategies to do so.\n\nEvans is an Episcopalian and attends St. Luke's Episcopal Church in Cleveland, Tennessee. She no longer considers herself to be an evangelical due to its close association with the Christian right in the United States. In early August 2016, Evans published an editorial for \"Vox\" defending her \"pro-life Christian\" position and support for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\n"}

{"id": "45863353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45863353", "title": "Social justice educational leadership", "text": "Social justice educational leadership\n\nSocial justice educational leadership emphasizes the belief that all students can and will reach proficiency, without exceptions or excuses, and that schools ought to be organized to advance the equitable learning of all students. Rather than focusing on one group of students who traditionally struggle, or who traditionally succeed, social justice leaders address the learning needs of all students. Social justice educational leadership specifically addresses how differences in race, income, language, ability, gender, and sexual orientation influence the design and effectiveness of learning environments. Social justice leadership draws from inclusive education practices from disability education, but extends the concepts further to support students from diverse groups with a wide range of needs. Through restructuring staff allocation and assessing student progress through disaggregated data, school leaders strive to create schools with equal access and equitable support for all students.\n\nSocial justice educational leaders recognize the role race, ethnicity, family income, ability, gender, and sexual orientation play in predicting student success in school. They commit to creating schools that address societal inequalities by striving to help all students reach academic proficiency. As described by Scheurich and Skrla, \"In striving for both equity and excellence... we are aiming for schools in which there are no persistent patterns of differences in academic success or treatment among students grouped by race, ethnicity, culture, neighborhood, income of parents, or home language. In other words, we are aiming to foster schools that literally serve each and every student really well.\" (pg. 2).\n\nIn order to assess whether these patterns of difference exist, social justice leaders use data tools, such as equity audits, to uncover structures that create differences in student learning outcomes. Equity audits use data such as standardized test scores, discipline rates, family involvement in schools, advanced course participation, special education labeling, at-risk identification, and intervention placement to create profiles of achievement for different student groups in the school. Equity audits reveal achievement gap trends in these areas, in which traditionally marginalized students frequently perform at lower levels than their more privileged peers. Many schools find demographically similar groups of students struggling in academics, language, discipline, graduation rates, and other markers of student success. Once these patterns are identified, social justice leaders equip staff and students with the skills necessary to address discrepancies in student learning needs.\n\nSocial justice leadership builds on concepts of inclusive education, in which services are brought to students in the general classroom environment, rather than pulling students out to a resource room. However, social justice leadership diverges somewhat from inclusive education in that full inclusion at all times is not required. Social justice leaders focus on providing services in classrooms and other flexible spaces that can be accessed by all students, rather than removing students to receive special support in separate classrooms. Social justice leadership also emphasizes assigning students to classrooms and groups using proportional representation. This means that the proportion of students in any classroom or group should match the natural proportion of students from all demographic groups in the school. For example, if 15% of the student body is Latino, then 15% of every classroom should be Latino, only 15% of students who qualify for special education should be Latino and only 15% of students receiving discipline should be Latino.\n\nThis method of bringing services to students in general education environments with proportional representation also differs from pull-out models like response to intervention (RtI). Many pull-out models identify students struggling in the classroom and assign them to interventions led by educator specialists outside the general education classroom, rather than by their classroom teachers. For students with more significant needs, pull-out interventions may be from several staff, such as from the Title I teacher, reading interventionist, speech therapist, and social worker, introducing multiple adults and environments to students who would most benefit from consistency. This practice locates the responsibility for educating students with additional needs with the interventionist, rather than the classroom teacher, reducing their efficacy.\n\nMany school behavior management efforts criminalize small infractions, and maintain a focus on retribution rather than restoration. This, combined with institutional and individual bias, results in a significant overrepresentation of students of color in suspension and expulsion rates. Advocates of social justice in schools purport that exclusionary discipline practices such as suspension and expulsion actively remove students from their school communities and exacerbate feelings of isolation and resentment.\n\nZero tolerance policies, popularized in the 1990s, have been shown to be ineffective on multiple measures, leaving school leaders looking for alternative strategies to promote safe and orderly learning environments. School leaders focused on social justice are additionally compelled to find strategies that disrupt persisting inequities. This is where restorative justice practices, culturally and linguistically responsive practices (CLRP) and Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) come into play as approaches aiming to address both institutional inequities and the need for safe learning environments.\n\nPBIS comes with a variety of acronyms. Some schools cut out the “intervention” part, going with the proactive-only PBS system. PBIS is more akin to the three-tiered Response to Intervention system. Others add in the necessity of schoolwide (SW) implementation, dubbing the program SWPBIS. Whatever variation is used (here, PBIS), the primary practices included in the system are listed below. PBIS has shown promise in reducing exclusionary discipline practices overall, but has not shown, on its own, to be effective at reducing the racial disparities in student discipline, and in some cases has even been shown to exacerbate the discrepancies by further reducing discipline referrals for White students, but not for students of color. These criticisms have led to a call for examination of PBIS, and the integration of CLRP with PBIS in order to address systemic inequities in school discipline.\n\nCLRP has its roots in the work of Gloria Ladson-Billings surrounding culturally relevant pedagogy. Reflecting on this initial thinking, Ladson-Billings more recently stated:By focusing on student learning and academic achievement versus classroom and behavior management, cultural competence versus cultural assimilation or eradication, and sociopolitical consciousness rather than school-based tasks that have no beyond-school application, I was able to see students take both responsibility for and deep interest in their education. This is the secret behind culturally relevant pedagogy: the ability to link principles of learning with deep understanding of (and appreciation for) culture.Other scholars have echoed and built upon this work, giving linguistic relevance footing in the literature, proposing specific practices that may help teachers improve pedagogical relevance, and considering how to best integrate PBIS and CLRP.\n\n\nThalia González describes restorative justice in schools as “an approach to discipline that engages all parties in a balanced practice that brings together all people impacted by an issue or behavior.” Heather Alexander details the roots of these practices, stating, “The principles of restorative justice are consistent with many indigenous traditions, including Canadian First Nations people and the Maori in New Zealand.” She also links restorative justice to “entangled roots in native, religious, and legal communities.” Alexander and González have studied how the underpinnings of various cultural, religious, and judicial practices have made their way into the philosophy and practice of restorative justice. Multiple scholars advocate for restorative practices as an alternative to exclusionary approaches to discipline, both in schools and in the criminal justice system.\n\nMany different practices (including, but not limited to: circles, mediation, conferencing, and youth courts) are labeled as restorative justice. Trevor Fronius, et. al describe restorative justice as “a broad term that encompasses a growing social movement to institutionalize peaceful and non-punitive approaches for addressing harm, responding to violations of legal and human rights, and problem solving.” This definition speaks to restorative justice as more of a collection of practices rooted in a common philosophy than a specific “program.” Fronius, et. al go on to say that “the emphasis on the harm done rather than the act is a widely recognized principle across the RJ literature.” and they speak to Dorothy Vaandering’s work surrounding “how to use shame as a path toward reintegration rather than stigmatization.\" \nKey Principles of Restorative Justice \n\nBoth inclusive and pull-out models seek to reduce the student to teacher ratio, but inclusive models do so by bringing services and staff expertise to students. Thus, social justice leaders need to strategically plan how to effectively allocate their limited staff resources. Rather than having several specialists who work with students with specific needs, leaders structure collaborative teams of classroom teachers, cross-categorical special education teachers, and bilingual resource teachers to support classrooms of students.\n\nSocial justice educational leadership has been critiqued in several ways. Some feel social justice leadership reinforces the categorization of students, even though the approach emphasizes reducing unnecessary student labeling. The data equity audits \nfocus mostly on identifying inequitable learning outcomes, but few solutions and strategies are suggested for improving these outcomes. By identifying the classroom teacher as responsible for ensuring all students reach proficiency, many teachers feel unsupported in the work and struggle to adequately differentiate lessons for their students. Finally, social justice educational leadership emphasizes proficiency as measured by standardized test scores, which limits the space for innovation and teaching that builds higher-order thinking, which is difficult to measure on standardized tests.\n\n"}
{"id": "8252625", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8252625", "title": "Standard Average European", "text": "Standard Average European\n\nStandard Average European (SAE) is a concept introduced in 1939 by Benjamin Whorf to group the modern Indo-European languages of Europe. Whorf argued that these languages were characterized by a number of similarities including syntax and grammar, vocabulary and its use as well as the relationship between contrasting words and their origins, idioms and word order which all made them stand out from many other language groups around the world which do not share these similarities; in essence creating a continental sprachbund. His point was to argue that the disproportionate degree of knowledge of SAE languages biased linguists towards considering grammatical forms to be highly natural or even universal, when in fact they were only peculiar to the SAE language group.\n\nWhorf contrasted what he called the SAE tense system which contrasts past, present and future tenses with that of the Hopi language, which Whorf analyzed as being based on a distinction not of tense, but on distinguishing things that have in fact occurred (a realis mood encompassing SAE past and present) as opposed to things that have as yet not occurred, but which may or may not occur in the future (irrealis mood). The accuracy of Whorf's analysis of Hopi tense has later been a point of controversy in linguistics.\n\nWhorf likely considered Romance and West Germanic to form the core of the SAE, i.e. the literary languages of Europe which have seen substantial cultural influence from Latin during the medieval period. The North Germanic and Balto-Slavic languages tend to be more peripheral members.\n\nAlexander Gode, who was instrumental in the development of Interlingua, characterized it as \"Standard Average European\". The Romance, Germanic, and Slavic control languages of Interlingua are reflective of the language groups most often included in the SAE \"Sprachbund\".\n\nAccording to Martin Haspelmath (2001), the SAE languages form a \"Sprachbund\" characterized by the following features, sometimes called \"euroversals\" by analogy with linguistic universals:\n\nBesides these features, which are uncommon outside Europe and thus useful for defining the SAE area, Haspelmath (2001) lists further features characteristic of European languages (but also found elsewhere):\n\nThere is also a broad agreement in the following parameters (not listed in Haspelmath 2001):\n\nThe \"Sprachbund\" defined this way consists of the following languages:\n\nThe Balkan sprachbund is thus included as a subset of the larger SAE, while the Baltic language area is a coordinate member.\n\nNot all the languages listed above show all the listed features, so membership in SAE can be described as gradient. Based on nine of the above-mentioned common features, Haspelmath regards French and German as forming the nucleus of the Sprachbund, surrounded by a core formed by English, the other Romance languages, the Nordic languages, and the Western and Southern Slavic languages. Hungarian, the Baltic languages, the Eastern Slavic languages, and the Finnic languages form more peripheral groups. All languages identified by Haspelmath as core SAE are Indo-European languages, except Hungarian and the Finnic languages. However, not all Indo-European languages are SAE languages: the Celtic, Armenian, and Indo-Iranian languages remain outside the SAE \"Sprachbund\".\n\nThe Standard Average European \"Sprachbund\" is most likely the result of ongoing language contact in the time of the Migration Period and later, continuing during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.\nInheritance of the SAE features from Proto-Indo-European can be ruled out because Proto-Indo-European, as currently reconstructed, lacked most of the SAE features.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3614477", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3614477", "title": "Taiwanese Mandarin", "text": "Taiwanese Mandarin\n\nMandarin Chinese (Taiwan) () is a dialect of Mandarin Chinese and the de facto official language of Taiwan. It is based on the phonology of the Beijing dialect together .\n\nTaiwanese Mandarin is almost identical to the official language of mainland China, called \"Standard Chinese(Pǔtōnghuà\"), with the exception of their writing systems. However, Mandarin as spoken informally in Taiwan has some notable differences in vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation with Standard Mandarin, differences which have arisen mainly under influence from Taiwanese Hokkien (), other mother tongues of Taiwan like Taiwanese Hakka () and Formosan languages, additionally English, and Japanese from the prior Japanese period.\n\nIn 1945 when the Republic of China took over Taiwan and surrounding islands from Japan, Mandarin was introduced as the official language and made compulsory in schools. A Mandarin Promotion Council (now called National Languages Committee) was established in 1946 by Taiwan Chief Executive Chen Yi to standardize and popularize the usage of Standard Mandarin in Taiwan. The Council was led by 21 Chinese Scholars such as Wei Jiangong (魏建功), He Rong (何容), Qi Tiehen (齊鐵恨), Wang Yuchuan (王玉川), Fang Shiduo (方師鐸), Zhu Zhaoxiang, Wu Shouli (吳守禮) etc. (From 1895 to 1945, Japanese was the official language and taught in schools.) Since then, Mandarin has been established as a \"lingua franca\" among the various groups in Taiwan: the majority Han ethnic Hoklo, the Hakka who have their own spoken variant, Mainlanders whose native tongue may be any Chinese variant from mainland China, and the Taiwanese aborigines who speak Formosan languages.\n\nUntil the 1980s the Kuomintang administration heavily promoted the use of Standard Mandarin and discouraged the use of Hokkien and other vernaculars, even portraying them as inferior. Mandarin was the only sanctioned Chinese variety for use in the media. This produced a backlash in the 1990s. Although some supporters of Taiwan independence tend to be opposed to standard Mandarin in favor of Hokkien, efforts to replace standard Mandarin either with Hokkien or with a multi-lingual standard have not been successful. Today, Mandarin is taught by immersion starting in elementary school. After the second grade, the entire educational system is in Mandarin, except for local language classes that have been taught for a few hours each week starting in the mid-1990s.\n\nTaiwanese Mandarin (as with Singlish and many other situations of a diglossia) is spoken at different levels according to the social class and situation of the speakers. Formal occasions call for the acrolectal level of \"Guoyu\" (Standard Mandarin). Less formal situations often result in the basilect form, which has more uniquely Hokkien features. Bilingual speakers often code-switch between Mandarin and Hokkien, sometimes in the same sentence.\n\nMandarin is spoken fluently by almost the entire Taiwanese population, except for some elderly people who were educated under Japanese rule. In the capital Taipei, where there is a high concentration of Mainlanders whose native variety is not Hokkien, Mandarin is used in greater frequency and fluency than other parts of Taiwan.\n\nTaiwanese Mandarin can be divided into three dialects, Taipei Mandarin (), Taichung Mandarin () and Southern Taiwan Mandarin ().\n\nTaiwanese Mandarin uses traditional Chinese characters, as opposed to the simplified Chinese characters on the mainland. Taiwanese braille is based on different letter assignments than Mainland Chinese braille. Romanization had once been distinct, but now the pinyin system can be seen in both sides, though pinyin is mainly used in Mainland China while the Wade-Giles and Gwoyeu Romatzyh system is more prominent in Taiwan.\n\nThere are two categories of pronunciation differences. The first is of characters that have an official pronunciation that differs from \"Putonghua\", primarily in the form of differences in tone, rather than in vowels or consonants. The second is more general, with differences being unofficial and arising through Taiwanese Hokkien influence on \"Guoyu\".\n\nThere are a few differences in official pronunciations, mainly in tone, between \"Guoyu\" and \"Putonghua\".\n\nThe following is a partial list of such differences:\nIn acrolectal Taiwanese Mandarin:\n\nIn basilectal Taiwanese Mandarin, sounds that do not occur in Hokkien are replaced by sounds from Hokkien. These variations from Standard Mandarin are similar to the variations of Mandarin spoken in southern China. Using the Hanyu Pinyin system, the following sound changes take place (going from \"Putonghua\" to Taiwanese Mandarin followed with an example):\n\n\nThe standard Mandarin construct (have or not have) is not as commonly used in Taiwanese Mandarin as in standard Mandarin. For example, the sentence \"Do you have a car?\" is as follows:\n\nFor non-recurring events, the construction involving is used where the sentence final particle would normally be applied to denote perfect. For instance, Taiwanese Mandarin more commonly uses \"\" to mean \"Have you seen a doctor?\" whereas Putonghua uses \"\". This is due to the influence of Hokkien grammar, which uses \"ū\" in a similar fashion. For recurring or certain events however, both Taiwanese and Mainland Mandarin use the latter, as in \"\", meaning \"Have you eaten?\"\n\nAnother example of Hokkien grammar's influence on Taiwanese Mandarin is the use of as \"to be\" verbs before adjectives, in addition to the usual meanings \"would\" or \"will\". For instance:\n\nThis reflects Hokkien syntax, as shown below:\n\nIn Putonghua, sentences would more likely be rendered as follows:\n\nVocabulary differences can be divided into several categories – particles, different usage of the same term, loan words, technological words, idioms, and words specific to living in Taiwan. Because of the limited transfer of information between mainland China and Taiwan after the Chinese civil war, many items that were invented after this split have different names in \"Guoyu\" and \"Putonghua\". Additionally, many terms were adopted from Japanese both as a result of its close proximity (Okinawa) as well as Taiwan's status as a Japanese territory in the first half of the 20th century.\n\nSpoken Taiwanese Mandarin uses a number of Taiwan specific (but not exclusive) final particles, such as 囉 (luō), 嘛(ma), 喔 (ō), 耶 (yē), 咧 (lie), 齁 (hō), 咩 (mei), 唷 (yō), etc.\n\nSome terms have different meanings in Taiwan and mainland China, which can sometimes lead to misunderstandings between speakers of different sides of the Taiwan Strait. Often there are alternative, unambiguous terms which can be understood by both sides.\n\nSome terms can be understood by both sides to mean the same thing; however, their preferred usage differs.\n\nLoan words may differ largely between Putonghua and Taiwanese Mandarin, as different characters or methods may be chosen for transliteration (phonetical or semantical), even the number of characters may differ. For example, U.S. President Barack Obama's surname is called \"Àobāmǎ\" in Putonghua and or \"Ōubāmǎ\" in Guoyu. Also, in Taiwanese Mandarin, rhotacization (erhua) is generally avoided.\n\nThe term ( \"májí\") borrowed from the English term \"match\", is used to describe items or people which complement each other well. Note that this term has become popular in mainland China as well.\n\nThe English term \"hamburger\" has been adopted in many Chinese-speaking communities. In Taiwan, the preferred form is (\"hànbǎo\") rather than the mainland Chinese (\"hànbǎobāo\").\n\nThe terms \" \"agōng\"\" and \" \"amà\"\" are more commonly heard than the standard Mandarin terms \"yéye\" (paternal grandfather), \"wàigōng\" (maternal grandfather), \"nǎinai\" (paternal grandmother) and \"wàipó\" (maternal grandmother).\n\nSome local foods usually are referred to using their Hokkien names. These include:\nList of Taiwanese Hokkien words commonly found in local Mandarin-language newspapers and periodicals\nJapanese loanwords based on kanji, now pronounced using Mandarin.\n\nJapanese loanwords based on phonetics, transliterated using Chinese characters with similar pronunciation in Mandarin or Taiwanese Hokkien.\n\n"}
{"id": "29984", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29984", "title": "Taurus (constellation)", "text": "Taurus (constellation)\n\nTaurus (Latin for \"the Bull\") is one of the constellations of the zodiac, which means it is crossed by the plane of the ecliptic. Taurus is a large and prominent constellation in the northern hemisphere's winter sky. It is one of the oldest constellations, dating back to at least the Early Bronze Age when it marked the location of the Sun during the spring equinox. Its importance to the agricultural calendar influenced various bull figures in the mythologies of Ancient Sumer, Akkad, Assyria, Babylon, Egypt, Greece, and Rome.\n\nA number of features exist that are of interest to astronomers. Taurus hosts two of the nearest open clusters to Earth, the Pleiades and the Hyades, both of which are visible to the naked eye. At first magnitude, the red giant Aldebaran is the brightest star in the constellation. In the northwest part of Taurus is the supernova remnant Messier 1, more commonly known as the Crab Nebula. One of the closest regions of active star formation, the Taurus-Auriga complex, crosses into the northern part of the constellation. The variable star T Tauri is the prototype of a class of pre-main-sequence stars.\n\nTaurus is a big and prominent constellation in the northern hemisphere's winter sky, between Aries to the west and Gemini to the east; to the north lies Perseus and Auriga, to the southeast Orion, to the south Eridanus, and to the southwest Cetus. In September and October, Taurus is visible in the evening along the eastern horizon. The most favorable time to observe Taurus in the night sky is during the months of December and January. By March and April, the constellation will appear to the west during the evening twilight.\n\nThis constellation forms part of the zodiac and hence is intersected by the ecliptic. This circle across the celestial sphere forms the apparent path of the Sun as the Earth completes its annual orbit. As the orbital plane of the Moon and the planets lie near the ecliptic, they can usually be found in the constellation Taurus during some part of each year. The galactic plane of the Milky Way intersects the northeast corner of the constellation and the galactic anticenter is located near the border between Taurus and Auriga. Taurus is the only constellation crossed by all three of the galactic equator, celestial equator, and ecliptic. A ring-like galactic structure known as Gould's Belt passes through the constellation.\n\nThe recommended three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is \"Tau\". The official constellation boundaries, as set by Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 26 segments. In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the declination coordinates are between 31.10° and −1.35°. Because a small part of the constellation lies to the south of the celestial equator, this can not be a completely circumpolar constellation at any latitude.\n\nDuring November, the Taurid meteor shower appears to radiate from the general direction of this constellation. The Beta Taurid meteor shower occurs during the months of June and July in the daytime, and is normally observed using radio techniques. Between 18 and 29 October, both the Northern Taurids and the Southern Taurids are active; though the latter stream is stronger. However, between November 1 and 10, the two streams equalize.\n\nThe brightest member of this constellation is Aldebaran, an orange-hued, spectral class K5 III giant star. Its name derives from \"\", Arabic for \"the follower\", probably from the fact that it follows the Pleiades during the nightly motion of the celestial sphere across the sky. Forming the profile of a Bull's face is a \"V\" or \"K\"-shaped asterism of stars. This outline is created by prominent members of the Hyades, the nearest distinct open star cluster after the Ursa Major Moving Group. In this profile, Aldebaran forms the bull's bloodshot eye, which has been described as \"glaring menacingly at the hunter Orion\", a constellation that lies just to the southwest. The Hyades span about 5° of the sky, so that they can only be viewed in their entirety with binoculars or the unaided eye. It includes a naked eye double star, Theta Tauri (the proper name of Theta Tauri is \"Chakumuy\"), with a separation of 5.6 arcminutes.\n\nIn the northeastern quadrant of the Taurus constellation lie the Pleiades (M45), one of the best known open clusters, easily visible to the naked eye. The seven most prominent stars in this cluster are at least visual magnitude six, and so the cluster is also named the \"Seven Sisters\". However, many more stars are visible with even a modest telescope. Astronomers estimate that the cluster has approximately 500-1,000 stars, all of which are around 100 million years old. However, they vary considerably in type. The Pleiades themselves are represented by large, bright stars; also many small brown dwarfs and white dwarfs exist. The cluster is estimated to dissipate in another 250 million years. The Pleiades cluster is classified as a Shapley class c and Trumpler class I 3 r n cluster, indicating that it is irregularly shaped and loose, though concentrated at its center and detached from the star-field.\n\nIn the northern part of the constellation to the northwest of the Pleiades lies the Crystal Ball Nebula, known by its catalogue designation of NGC 1514. This planetary nebula is of historical interest following its discovery by German-born English astronomer William Herschel in 1790. Prior to that time, astronomers had assumed that nebulae were simply unresolved groups of stars. However, Herschel could clearly resolve a star at the center of the nebula that was surrounded by a nebulous cloud of some type. In 1864, English astronomer William Huggins used the spectrum of this nebula to deduce that the nebula is a luminous gas, rather than stars.\n\nTo the west, the two horns of the bull are formed by Beta (β) Tauri and Zeta (ζ) Tauri; two star systems that are separated by 8°. Beta is a white, spectral class B7 III giant star known as \"El Nath\", which comes from the Arabic phrase \"the butting\", as in butting by the horns of the bull. At magnitude 1.65, it is the second brightest star in the constellation, and shares the border with the neighboring constellation of Auriga. As a result, it also bears the designation Gamma Aurigae. Zeta Tauri (the proper name is \"Tianguan\") is an eclipsing binary star that completes an orbit every 133 days.\n\nA degree to the northwest of ζ Tauri is the Crab Nebula (M1), a supernova remnant. This expanding nebula was created by a Type II supernova explosion, which was seen from Earth on July 4, 1054. It was bright enough to be observed during the day and is mentioned in Chinese historical texts. At its peak, the supernova reached magnitude −4, but the nebula is currently magnitude 8.4 and requires a telescope to observe. North American peoples also observed the supernova, as evidenced from a painting on a New Mexican canyon and various pieces of pottery that depict the event. However, the remnant itself was not discovered until 1731, when John Bevis found it.\n\nThe star Lambda (λ) Tauri is an eclipsing binary star. This system consists of a spectral class B3 star being orbited by a less massive class A4 star. The plane of their orbit lies almost along the line of sight to the Earth. Every 3.953 days the system temporarily decreases in brightness by 1.1 magnitudes as the brighter star is partially eclipsed by the dimmer companion. The two stars are separated by only 0.1 astronomical units, so their shapes are modified by mutual tidal interaction. This results in a variation of their net magnitude throughout each orbit.\n\nLocated about 1.8° west of Epsilon (ε) Tauri is T Tauri, the prototype of a class of variable stars called T Tauri stars. This star undergoes erratic changes in luminosity, varying between magnitude 9 to 13 over a period of weeks or months. This is a newly formed stellar object that is just emerging from its envelope of gas and dust, but has not yet become a main sequence star. The surrounding reflection nebula NGC 1555 is illuminated by T Tauri, and thus is also variable in luminosity. To the north lies Kappa Tauri, a visual double star consisting of two A7-type components. The pair have a separation of just 5.6 arc minutes, making them a challenge to split with the naked eye.\n\nThis constellation includes part of the Taurus-Auriga complex, or Taurus dark clouds, a star-forming region containing sparse, filamentary clouds of gas and dust. This spans a diameter of and contains 35,000 solar masses of material, which is both larger and less massive than the Orion Nebula. At a distance of , this is one of the nearest active star forming regions. Located in this region, about 10° to the northeast of Aldebaran, is an asterism NGC 1746 spanning a width of 45 arcminutes.\n\nThe identification of the constellation of Taurus with a bull is very old, certainly dating to the Chalcolithic, and perhaps even to the Upper Paleolithic. Michael Rappenglück of the University of Munich believes that Taurus is represented in a cave painting at the Hall of the Bulls in the caves at Lascaux (dated to roughly 15,000 BC), which he believes is accompanied by a depiction of the Pleiades. The name \"seven sisters\" has been used for the Pleiades in the languages of many cultures, including indigenous groups of Australia, North America and Siberia. This suggests that the name may have a common ancient origin.\n\nTaurus marked the point of vernal (spring) equinox in the Chalcolithic and the Early Bronze Age, from about 4000 BC to 1700 BC, after which it moved into the neighboring constellation Aries. The Pleiades were closest to the Sun at vernal equinox around the 23rd century BC. In Babylonian astronomy, the constellation was listed in the MUL.APIN as , \"The Bull of Heaven\". As this constellation marked the vernal equinox, it was also the first constellation in the Babylonian zodiac and they described it as \"The Bull in Front\". The Akkadian name was \"Alu\".\n\nIn the Old Babylonian \"Epic of Gilgamesh\", the goddess Ishtar sends Taurus, the Bull of Heaven, to kill Gilgamesh for spurning her advances. Enkidu tears off the bull's hind part and hurls the quarters into the sky where they become the stars we know as Ursa Major and Ursa Minor. Some locate Gilgamesh as the neighboring constellation of Orion, facing Taurus as if in combat, while others identify him with the sun whose rising on the equinox vanquishes the constellation. In early Mesopotamian art, the Bull of Heaven was closely associated with Inanna, the Sumerian goddess of sexual love, fertility, and warfare. One of the oldest depictions shows the bull standing before the goddess' standard; since it has 3 stars depicted on its back (the cuneiform sign for \"star-constellation\"), there is good reason to regard this as the constellation later known as Taurus.\n\nThe same iconic representation of the Heavenly Bull was depicted in the Dendera zodiac, an Egyptian bas-relief carving in a ceiling that depicted the celestial hemisphere using a planisphere. In these ancient cultures, the orientation of the horns was portrayed as upward or backward. This differed from the later Greek depiction where the horns pointed forward. To the Egyptians, the constellation Taurus was a sacred bull that was associated with the renewal of life in spring. When the spring equinox entered Taurus, the constellation would become covered by the Sun in the western sky as spring began. This \"sacrifice\" led to the renewal of the land. To the early Hebrews, Taurus was the first constellation in their zodiac and consequently it was represented by the first letter in their alphabet, Aleph.\n\nIn Greek mythology, Taurus was identified with Zeus, who assumed the form of a magnificent white bull to abduct Europa, a legendary Phoenician princess. In illustrations of Greek mythology, only the front portion of this constellation is depicted; this was sometimes explained as Taurus being partly submerged as he carried Europa out to sea. A second Greek myth portrays Taurus as Io, a mistress of Zeus. To hide his lover from his wife Hera, Zeus changed Io into the form of a heifer. Greek mythographer Acusilaus marks the bull Taurus as the same that formed the myth of the Cretan Bull, one of The Twelve Labors of Heracles.\n\nTaurus became an important object of worship among the Druids. Their Tauric religious festival was held while the Sun passed through the constellation. Among the arctic people known as the Inuit, the constellation is called Sakiattiat and the Hyades is Nanurjuk, with the latter representing the spirit of the polar bear. Aldebaran represents the bear, with the remainder of the stars in the Hyades being dogs that are holding the beast at bay.\n\nIn Buddhism, legends hold that Gautama Buddha was born when the Full Moon was in Vaisakha, or Taurus. Buddha's birthday is celebrated with the Wesak Festival, or Vesākha, which occurs on the first or second Full Moon when the Sun is in Taurus.\n\n, the Sun appears in the constellation Taurus from May 13 to June 21. In tropical astrology, the Sun is considered to be in the sign Taurus from April 20 to May 20.\n\nThe space probe \"Pioneer 10\" is moving in the direction of this constellation, though it will not be nearing any of the stars in this constellation for many thousands of years, by which time its batteries will be long dead.\n\nSeveral stars in Hyades cluster include Kappa Tauri were photographed during Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919 by the expedition of Arthur Eddington in Príncipe and others in Sobral, Brazil that confirmed Albert Einstein's prediction of the bending of light around the Sun from his general theory of relativity which he published in 1915.\n\n\n"}

It was translated into English by the author's son Dmitri Nabokov in 1965.\n\nAt just over 100 pages, \"The Eye\" is Nabokov's shortest novel. Nabokov himself referred to it as a 'little novel' and it is a work that sits somewhere around the boundary between extended short story and novella. It was produced during a hiatus in Nabokov's creation of short stories between 1927 and 1930 as a result of his growing success as a novelist.\n\nAs in many of Nabokov's early works, the characters are largely Russian émigrés relocated to Europe, specifically Berlin. In this case, the novel is set in two houses where a young Russian tutor, Smurov, is renting room and board.\n\nThe action of the novel largely begins after the attempted (perhaps successful) suicide of the protagonist. This occurs after he suffers a beating at the hands of a cuckolded husband (the protagonist has been having an affair with a woman called Matilda with whom he has also, apparently, been rather bored). After his supposed death, and assuming everything in the world around him to be a manifestation of his 'leftover' imagination, his \"eye\" observes a group of Russian émigrés as he tries to ascertain their opinions of the character Smurov, around whom much uncertainty and suspicion exists.\n\nThe novel deals largely with indeterminate locus of identity and the social construction of identity in the reactions and opinions of others. Smurov exists as a fraud, nobleman, scoundrel, \"sexual adventurer\", thief, and spy in the eyes of the various characters. In some senses, Smurov is akin to the narrator of Dostoevsky's \"Notes from Underground\". As the protagonist carefully collects these observations, he attempts to build a stable perspective on Smurov — whom we only belatedly discover is the narrator himself. The result is a meditation on the relationship between subjectivity and objectivity.\n\nThe work is the first one in Nabokov's oeuvre involving a first-person narrator and, specifically, one who imposes his fantasy world upon the real world. This was to be a structure that was developed further in later works such as \"Despair\" (1934), \"Pale Fire\" (1962) and his final novel, \"Look at the Harlequins!\" (1974). In a 1967 interview with Alfred Appel Jr, Nabokov retrospectively suggested that the work might have represented a turning-point in his career in this respect.\n\n"}
{"id": "54180965", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54180965", "title": "The Liberal Imagination", "text": "The Liberal Imagination\n\nThe Liberal Imagination: Essays on Literature and Society (1950) is a collection of sixteen essays by American literary critic Lionel Trilling, published by Viking in 1950. The book was edited by Pascal Covici, who had worked with Trilling when he edited and introduced Viking's \"Portable Matthew Arnold\" in 1949. With the exception of the preface, which was written specifically for the publication of the book, all the essays included in \"The Liberal Imagination\" were individually published in the decade before the book's publication in literary and critical journals, such as \"The Partisan Review\", \"The Kenyon Review\", \"The Nation\", and \"The American Quarterly\". The essays, then, represent Trilling's written work and critical thoughts of the 1940s.\n\nIn the essays, Trilling explores the theme of what he calls \"liberalism\" by looking closely at the relationship between literature, culture, mind, and the imagination. He offers passionate critiques against literary ideas of reality as material and physical, such as those he ascribes to V. L. Parrington, Theodore Dreiser, and the writers of the Kinsey Reports. He supports writers who engage in \"moral realism\" through an engaged imagination and a \"power of love,\" which he sees expressed in works by Henry James, Mark Twain, Tacitus, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and William Wordsworth—and in the ideas of human nature in the works of Sigmund Freud.\n\n\"The Liberal Imagination\" enjoyed a relatively large commercial success, selling 100,000 hardcover and 70,000 paperback copies, and was later to be understood as an essential book for a group of influential literary, political, and cultural thinkers of the era, called “The New York Intellectuals.\" The initial reviewers, such as Irving Howe, R. P. Blackmore, Norman Podhoretz, and Delmore Schwartz, represent the importance of this book to the \"Intellectuals.\" In later years, scholars turned to \"The Liberal Imagination\" as a work representative of the post-war politics and culture of the United States, which was entering the early stages of the Cold War with the Soviet Union.\n\nTrilling introduces the book, writing that though the essays that comprise the volume “are diverse in subject, they have...a certain unity.” The unity, he suggests, is an interest in liberalism. Trilling argues that because his contemporary America is predominantly tending to an intellectually liberal tradition, the lack of a robust conservative intellectual tradition causes the lack of a cultural dialectic, making liberal ideas also weak. He writes that a critical view on literature is the best way to “recall liberalism to its first essential imagination” because it is the “human activity that takes the fullest and most precise account of variousness, possibility, complexity, and difficulty.” In this way, Trilling introduces that his essays on literature will inevitably broach topics of culture, politics, and imagination.\n\nTrilling confronts the influence of literary critic V.L. Parrington’s \"Main Currents in American Thought\" (1927), and the response to the novels of American writer Theodore Dreiser, to discuss what he sees as the dangerous consequences of a writer's supposed responsibility to a conception of reality as material and physical. Trilling argues that Parrington believed in a reality that is \"immutable; it is wholly external, it is irreducible,\" and that Parrington believed the job of a literary writer to be the transmission of this reality by loyal reproduction. This conception of reality can turn Americans toward an unwarranted \"sympathetic indulgence\" of writers, such as Dreiser, who claim to represent material reality (\"hard, resistant, unformed, impenetrable, and unpleasant.\") when they are really representing an ideology of reality, such as Dreiser's nihilism. It also informs a disavowal of writers, such as Henry James, that engage in the \"electrical qualities of the mind,\" and are not easily conformed to a social mission or politic.\n\nTrilling addresses the literary work and career of novelist Sherwood Anderson, trying to reconcile his admiration for the man with the problems of his work. He assesses Anderson as victim to the fate \"of the writer who at one short past moment has had a success with a simple idea which he allowed to remain simple and fixed.\" Trilling describes Anderson's \"standing quarrel with respectable society\" as one that once bred a truth related to the \"precious secret essence\" of individuals, but then led to a negation of the life of his characters through an excess of intellection, feeling, and a \"love made wholly abstract.\" Trilling writes, \"the more Anderson says about people, the less alive they become—and the less loveable.\" Though Trilling's evaluation of Anderson's truth is that it failed in literary expression—and that his lifeless worlds suggest a politic of subservient \"marching men\"—Trilling still admires the truthfulness of Anderson's \"personal struggle with modernity,\" likening Anderson's work to an adolescence one must experience and eventually move on from.\n\nTrilling sees Sigmund Freud’s psychology as the \"only systematic account of the human mind which, in point of subtlety and complexity, of interest and tragic power, deserves to stand beside the psychological insights which literature has accumulated through the centuries.\" Trilling argues that Freud's relationship of influence with literature is reciprocal; that Freud was positivistic and rationalistic, and not devoted only to the \"night side of life\"; and that one can make a connection between Freud's conceptions of the dream, neurosis, and art to explain how an artist \"is in command of his fantasy, while it is exactly the mark of the neurotic that he is possessed by his fantasy.\" Trilling rejects psychoanalytic readings of literary works that rely on an author's intention, and proposes that readers look for the \"whole conception of the mind\" implicit in a work's psychological \"effects\" and the psychological \"temperament of the artist as a man.\" Trilling ends the essay reflecting on Freud's later work, in which the \"death instinct\" was introduced to compliment the \"pleasure principle,\" forming a state of man as \"a kind of hell from within him from which rise everlastingly the impulses which threaten his civilization,\" where \"compromise and the compounding with defeat constitute his best way of getting through the world.\" Thus, Trilling applauds Freud's tragic sense of the state of humanity.\n\nTrilling places Henry James’s novel, \"The Princess Casamassima\" (1886), as among the greatest of novels from the nineteenth century. In his reading of the novel, Trilling points out James's \"penetrating imagination\" that gives an accurate account and imagining of not only the anarchy of the 1880s, but also the \"social actuality\" of anarchy's general moral claim on the goodness of humanity and the corruptive character of society. Trilling investigates the autobiographical aspects of the novel to conclude that the novel also acts as James's \"demonstrative message,\" and that the artist possesses social responsibility. James's novel is an achievement of what Trilling calls \"moral realism,\" which rests on James's \"knowledge of complication,\" a penetrating awareness of \"modern ironies,\" and an \"imagination of disaster\" complimented by an \"imagination of love.\" Trilling concludes that James's moral realism in the novel results in an incomparable work that tells \"the truth in a single luminous creation.\"\n\nTrilling wrote this essay on the event of the publication of \"The Partisan Reader\", celebrating the ten-year anniversary of the literary magazine Partisan Review, a magazine that, though influential, maintained a relatively low circulation. He argues that this irony is representative of a \"great gulf\" between the educated class and the best of contemporary literature, caused by a \"fatal separation\" “between the political ideas of our educated class and the deep places of the imagination.\" Partisan Review's mission, Trilling writes, is to \"organize a union\" between political ideas and the imagination by insisting on the realization that \"unless we insist that politics is imagination and mind, we will learn that imagination and mind are politics and of the kind that we will not like.\"\n\nTrilling offers a reading of Mark Twain’s \"Huckleberry Finn\" to explain why he believes it to be \"one of the greatest books and one of the central documents of American culture.\" Trilling argues that the book tells the truth \"of moral passion\" between the protagonist Huck and the benign and dangerous \"river-God\", symbolized by the Mississippi River. Trilling describes Huck's moral crisis as being between his \"genuinely good will\" and his distrust of others, based on a \"profound and bitter knowledge of human depravity.\" He also mentions that the book's context in the years after the American Civil War implies that the book is commentary on an America that lost its moral values by serving a \"money-god\" without moral value, in the place of the moral river-god of \"Huckleberry Finn\".\n\nTrilling sees Rudyard Kipling as a writer belonging \"irrevocably to our past;\" specifically, the past of childhood, where a justified rejection of him represents \"our first literary-political decision.\" Kipling, Trilling writes, was \"one of liberalism's major intellectual misfortunes.\" Trilling describes Kipling as unlovable because of the mindlessness of his ideas, most especially of his \"mindless imperialism,\" which made readers react against him as a dangerous proponent of nationalism and national values. In so doing, Trilling argues, Kipling did damage to the very national values he cared so much about.\n\nIn his reading of William Wordsworth’s ode, \"\", Trilling counters the biographical reading of the poem as what literary critic Dean Sperry calls Wordsworth's \"dirge sung over his departing powers.\" Evoking the context of the poem in comparison with Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s \"Dejection: Ode” and Wordsworth’s autobiographical Prelude, Trilling argues the ode is Wordsworth’s embrace of “new powers” and a “new poetic subject.” Trilling sees Wordsworth’s new power as a “double vision” through which he recognizes the ideal and earthly qualities of life and humanity. In this way, the poem represents Wordsworth’s maturity into adulthood, and an awareness of mortality, that makes the world even more “significant and precious.”\n\nTrilling confronts the notion that an artist’s imagination and genius comes from a neurotic illness. He concedes that one can gain “psychic knowledge” through psychological suffering, but maintains that an artist’s power is related to the mind in general, not only to the artist’s inner mind. Trilling offers a universal idea of neurosis, in which it is possible that all of humanity is “ill” with neurotic conflicts. An artist’s genius, Trilling argues, is how he articulates and represents the neurotic conflict to effect the readers’ “egos in struggle.” Trilling concludes that we should focus on how an artist “shapes the material of pain we all have.”\n\nTrilling believes, countering the formal reading style of the New Critics, that we must read literature with a sense of its past. The aesthetic aspect of a work's \"pastness\" (\"the intellectual conditions in which a work of literature was made\") is an important part of understanding its power, validity, and relevance. Trilling also argues that literary artists are both effects and causes of culture, and that historical criticism which treats a literary movement as something that can fail or succeed incorrectly supposes ideas are autonomous \"generators of human events,\" that literature is meant to settle the problems of life \"for good,\" and that the will plays little part in human life. Thus, Trilling suggests (evoking Nietzsche) \"an ambivalent view\" of the historical sense that looks to culture as \"life's continuing evaluation of itself.\"\n\nTrilling argues that though his histories \"have been put to strange uses,\" Roman historian Tacitus had a psychological \"conception of history [that] was avowedly personal and moral.\" Trilling believes the \"bitter division\" between Tacitus's love of the Roman Republic's virtues and character and his despair at the republic's day having past informed a \"secret tension\" that \"accounts for the poise and energy of his intellect.\"\n\nTrilling argues that manners, the \"hum and buzz of implication,\" are a significant part of the formation of culture, and therefore are an important part of literature. He sees a novel's focus on social manners as a focus on a moral conflict between reality and appearance, a research into the truth behind the \"snobbery\" of false appearance and moneyed status. A novelist's creative awareness of manners becomes the \"function of his love,\" making his literary work what Trilling calls \"moral realism,\" in which the moral imagination is given free play. Trilling concludes that the novel of manners has never been \"established\" in America because of a conception of reality as the \"hard, brute facts of existence.\" Moral realism, he argues, is sorely needed to respond to a contemporary commitment to \"moral righteousness.\"\n\nTrilling introduces the publication and commercial success of The Kinsey Reports (1948) as a therapy for society's need for the establishment of a \"community of sexuality\" and a symptom of that community's need to be \"established in explicit quantitative terms.\" The study's scientific look at sex, Trilling finds, implies a neutrality, but hides a conception of sex as only existing first in its physical fact, rather than in interaction with its emotional reality. Trilling argues that the Report dehumanizes sexual behavior and rejects the idea that sex is involved with an \"individual's character.\" This is especially true in the Report's discussion of sexual taboos, in which the writers reject the innateness of homosexuality and neglect that \"the emotional circumstance of breaking of the taboo\" is more significant than physically breaking the taboo itself. Trilling concludes that the Report's idea of fact as a \"physical fact\" rejects the crucial \"personal or cultural meaning,\" or \"even the existence,\" of the social fact of sexuality.\n\nTrilling examines the life and literary career of American novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald, admiring Fitzgerald's heroism found \"in his power of love.\" Fitzgerald's tragic love, Trilling suggests, is \"destructive by reason of its very tenderness,\" because it was a \"delicate tension\" between an idea of human free-will along with a belief in the force of circumstance. Trilling calls Fitzgerald \"a moralist to the core,\" because Fitzgerald was able to transcend the historical moment to \"seize the moment as a moral fact.\" Analyzing Fitzgerald's novel, \"The Great Gatsby\", Trilling writes that the character Gatsby, \"divided between power and dream, comes inevitably to stand for America itself.\" Trilling concludes that Fitzgerald's known lack of prudence is in fact his \"heroic fault,\" in that it allowed him to deal, with tenderness, \"a true firmness of moral judgment.\"\n\nTrilling reflects on whether \"the novel is still a living form,\" concluding that he does not believe the novel to be dead. He sees the declining perception of the novel as reflective of a weakness in the \"general intellectual life\" and a passivity in the political mind. Trilling argues that the novel, as a \"celebration and investigation of the human will,\" can reconstitute the will by teaching it to refuse the temptation of the ideologies of the social world. Trilling predicts that the novels of the future will \"deal very explicitly with ideas,\" and that they should criticize ideas by attaching them to their \"appropriately actuality,\" instead of allowing ideas to be systematized thoughtlessly through ideology. Trilling wants novelists to realize their ability \"to maintain ambivalence toward their society,\" and wants a general understanding of the \"fortuitous and gratuitous nature of art\" that makes an intellectual atmosphere where novels are possible.\n\nTrilling defines an idea as the product of the juxtaposition of two emotions, and as the key dialectic component of literature. He sees the anxiety about ideas in literature as actually an anxiety that ideology, a \"respect for certain formulas\" whose \"meaning and consequence we have no clear understanding,\" will intellectualize the power and spontaneity out of life. Poets, Trilling argues, can be attracted to ideas without being \"violated\" by them, and poets often try to develop consistent intellectual positions along with their poetry. Trilling elevates the importance of \"activity\" in literary thinking that keeps ideas constantly at play with one another. He categorizes the American writers John Dos Passos, Eugene O’Neill, and Thomas Wolfe as violated by an idea because of passivity, and argues that the \"piety\" of writers like Ernest Hemingway and William Faulkner allowed them to engage their hearts deeply with ideas. Trilling concludes by advocating that we think of ideas as \"living things, inescapably connected with our wills and desires,\" in order to facilitate a more active literature.\n\nCommentators of \"The Liberal Imagination\" note two distinguishing qualities of Trilling's prose: his use of the plural singular and the balanced sentence. The common subject, ‘we,’ in Trilling’s writing produces both an inviting and authoritative effect because readers feel that they are a part of the educated and literate podium behind which Trilling stands, and that they are sharing in not “mere opinion,” but “corporate understanding.” His repeated employment of a parallel sentence-structure may symbolize Trilling’s dedication to the “negative capability” he encourages throughout the book, in which a thinker can hold two ideas in his head at once and function nonetheless.\n\nLiterary critic and democratic-socialist advocate Irving Howe, in his review of the book in The Nation, finds troubling Trilling's criticism of moral passions that do not account for \"an active moral passion against social injustice,\" and contends that the definition Trilling relies on does not match liberalism’s history as a \"code of intellectual tolerance and freedom,\" as the bringer of the Enlightenment, and as the political doctrine that supports capitalism. Howe describes Trilling as an ideologue whose work is \"excessively dependent on that mere will whose danger he has so often observed.\"\n\nA 21-year-old student at Columbia and writing for British journal Scrutiny, Norman Podhoretz, later to become a substantial figure in the \"neo-conservative\" movement that grew out of \"The New York Intellectuals,\" writes that \"The Liberal Imagination\" is not really about liberalism at all (as Howe argues); it is \"a collection of critical essays,\" whose purpose is to clear the air rather than definitively demonstrate. As criticism, Podhoretz suggests, it represents Trilling's belief that America's future depends on an integration of the European influence of British literary thinker Matthew Arnold’s criticism into \"the American pattern,\" which Trilling attempts in the book.\n\nIn his essay published in The Partisan Review, poet and short-novelist Delmore Schwartz, critically evaluated \"Manners, Morals, and the Novel,\" as representative of what he calls Trilling's ability to make his personal preference for a novel of manners into a \"standard of judgment and a program for the novelist.\"Schwartz explains this personal preference as symptomatic of Trilling's general dislike for the method of modern authors and what Schwartz sees as Trilling's veiled sole concern: not the general welfare of the society in general, but “the welfare of the educated class,” of which Trilling acts a “guardian and critic.”\n\nLiterary critic and Princeton professor of English R.P. Blackmur, in his 1950 review of the book in the Kenyon Review, writes that the core questions of \"The Liberal Imagination\" are what the American mind is to do with \"mass urban society,\" and what is to be done to surmount a pervasive distrust of the intellect. Blackmur posits that the literature Trilling supports never existed. The true subject Trilling addresses, Blackmur suggests, is the \"politics of human power,\" and the place literature has in creating \"turbulence\" in ordering principles of societal living.\n\nLater commentators on \"The Liberal Imagination\" focus on the historical, political, and cultural contexts and influences of Trilling's work and thoughts. The Liberal Imagination can be seen as Trilling's response to the simplifying force of the Marxism and disillusionment prevalent in the orthodoxy of the American political left in 1930s life, best exemplified by the Soviet Union's Popular Front, by presenting himself through the essays as the \"Intellectuals’ Representative Man.\" Indeed, \"The Liberal Imagination\" can be read as a pivotal point in the New York Intellectuals' turn from a Soviet communism to a strong anti-Stalinist cultural front. The anti-Stalinist implications in \"The Liberal Imagination\" exist in the ways Trilling articulates a critical stance against reductive, simplifying, and systematized ideological thinking.\n\nThe publication of \"The Liberal Imagination\" also stands as a critical moment in Trilling’s career as he developed his position as a public intellectual. As a representative of complexity, Trilling, in place of an applicable theory of reading, offers a “certain temper” to serve as the basis of a critical analysis of politics, culture, and literature. But, in his expressed ambivalence to exactly what kind of politic or society he envisions, he leaves open the possible results of the critical mindset he proposes; this is perhaps because Trilling was already aware that the logical conclusion of his temper is a profound conservativism.\n\nTrilling, in the years following the publication of \"The Liberal Imagination\", came to typify a broader “conservative turn” of liberal intellectuals turned anti-communist and suspicious of the reductive character of the intellectual left. Further, many of Trilling’s intellectual heirs include prominent neo-conservatives, such as Irving Kristol and Norman Podhoretz. In terms of literature, the way of reading presented in \"The Liberal Imagination\", in which a single author can embody the essence of his culture, “provided the rationale” of the reduction of American authors from college textbooks between the years of 1940s and 1970s, along with an increased neo-conservative focus on the “tragic vision” that would be pervasive in literature syllabi in mid-twentieth century America.\n\n"}

Given its importance, the governor of Santa Fe, Jorge Obeid, decreed a public holiday for the opening day.\n\nThe main base of the activities of the Congress was El Círculo Theater, especially restored for the occasion. It started with a welcome session presented by heads of State and writers. The Congress itself comprised a series of lectures and parallel cultural activities. It included a homage to the Argentine writer Ernesto Sábato. A dictionary of linguistic doubts (\"Diccionario Panhispánico de Dudas\") was introduced, and the Cervantes Institute presented a new linguistic competence certificate for Spanish as a foreign language.\n\nCommemorating the fourth centennial of the first publishing of \"Don Quixote\", a brand-new special edition was released by the Real Academia Española and Editorial Santillana, with the support of the Association of Academies of the Spanish Language. Its 12,000 copies were reported sold out in less than a month.\n\nRepresenting Spain, the Congress was attended by the King Juan Carlos I and the Queen Sofía; Argentine President Néstor Kirchner represented the national government. The presidents of Colombia and Mexico, as well as other important representatives of Spanish-speaking countries, were also present.\n\nAs guest lecturers there were the writers Carlos Fuentes, Nobel Prize winner José Saramago, Ernesto Cardenal, and Ernesto Sábato. The Rosario-born novelist, comics artist and humorist Roberto Fontanarrosa broke the ice in a debate about the importance of insults in interpersonal communication.\n\nThe Congress met opposition on the part of activist groups representing some linguistic and ethnic minorities, and became a focus for the confluence of many movements related to the left, from anti-globalization sympathizers to revisionists of the historic role of Spain and the Church in the colonization of the Americas (and the ensuing decline of native languages and cultures). The beginning of the Congress was protested by a large demonstration.\n\nIn line with these protests, there was another gathering, the \"Congreso de laS LenguaS\", to discuss linguistic and cultural diversity in the region. It was presided by Nobel Peace Prize Adolfo Pérez Esquivel.\n\n\"In Spanish unless otherwise noted:\"\n"}

The American Choral Directors Association defines a treble as \"a singer, both male and female, ages eight to sixteen\".\n\nWhile the term treble is gender neutral, the term is widely used in place of the term boy soprano within the United Kingdom. The term became widely used by English composers of polyphonic choral music during the English pre-Reformation and Reformation eras. At this time choral music written for the Church of England was often voiced in 5 parts with TrMATB (Treble, Meane, Alto, Tenor, Bass) being one of the most common voicings utilized by Thomas Tallis and his contemporaries.\n\nIn the Baroque era the term treble was used differently than it is today. The term was used in operas, cantatas, choral works, and other compositions to refer to three different kinds of singers: adult women, boy sopranos, and castrati.

Unintentionally leaving a firearm loaded is more likely to occur when the individual handling the gun is poorly trained, and perhaps also with removable-magazine-fed firearms (as the magazine may be removed, giving an unloaded appearance even when a round remains chambered—see discussion of magazine-safeties below).\n\nA second common cause of negligent discharges is when the gun-handler places their finger on the trigger before they have decided to shoot. With the finger so positioned, many activities may cause the finger to compress the trigger unintentionally. For example, if one attempts to holster the firearm with finger on trigger, the holster edge will drive the finger onto the trigger, and discharge is likely. If one stumbles or struggles (with an adversary) with finger on trigger, the grasping motion of both hands will likely cause the trigger finger to compress the trigger.\n\nGun safety rules recognize the above possibilities, and aim to prevent them. The primary firearm safety rule usually listed by any source is a version of \"Always keep the gun pointed in safe direction.\" Following this rule ensures that, should an accidental discharge occur, no harm will be done. Second, one's finger should remain outside the trigger guard until the decision has been made to fire the weapon; even if (some would say especially if) one is facing a hostile adversary and has to be prepared to fire at a moment's notice, keeping the finger out of the trigger-guard until one has decided to shoot will prevent an accidental shooting.\n\nWhen a firearm is not in use, storing it unloaded and in a separate container from ammunition may also help prevent accidental discharges, especially if the stored firearm is \"accessed\" by an unauthorized user.\n\nOn occasion, an accidental discharge can occur by means other than the finger pulling the trigger, such as dropping a loaded weapon. Because of this possibility, most currently produced pistols are designed with a \"drop-safety\" or firing pin block, a mechanism inhibiting or isolating the firing pin, preventing accidental discharge if the firearm is dropped. However, most long guns do not have drop-safeties.\n\nPrevention of dropped-firearm ADs with long guns therefore depends on the user being familiar with the precautions needed for that particular gun: it is standard practice for all long-gun users to unload the firearm's chamber before any activity that might foreseeably result in a dropped firearm (e.g., climbing a fence while hunting), and before placing the firearm in a vehicle (where sudden deceleration may cause the firearm to act as if dropped).\n\nAccidental discharges not involving trigger-pull can also occur if the firearm is mechanically unsound: poor maintenance, abuse, inept \"gunsmithing,\" or the use of substandard materials or defective ammunition in the gun may all lead to breakage.\n\nIn World War II, early versions of the British Sten gun were notorious for accidentally discharging when dropped. While dropping any long gun with loaded chamber can be dangerous, the use of a soft bronze bolt in early Stens—allowing the sear contact area to wear down quickly—made ADs even more likely.\n\nAs the early Sten gun illustrates, \"poor design,\" including the specification of unsuitable component materials, is sometimes cited as a cause for some firearms being \"unsafe.\" Surely, any firearm that can discharge by itself when loaded is unsafe, and no user would want to handle a firearm that has a high likelihood of accidental discharge when employed for its intended use. But, firearm designs incorporating fewer safeties are not intrinsically unsafe—see discussion of long-guns above—even if they do require competence and proper training for safe use.\n\nA relevant discussion attends the use of magazine-safeties in semi-automatic pistols. Such safeties prevent the pistol from firing if there is a round in the chamber, but the magazine is removed. Some self-defense experts dislike this feature, as it may allow the pistol to be \"disabled\" unexpectedly during a struggle, so that the pistol fails when needed. Others feel that it may improve user safety and prevent some accidental discharges. Both semi-auto pistol designs, with and without magazine-safeties, are currently manufactured.\n\nOne last form of accidental discharge, known as \"cooking off,\" occurs when a weapon becomes overheated, with the firing chamber hot enough to ignite the propellant charge in the ammunition round, causing the cartridge to fire. As recently as 1979, this problem doomed the innovative Heckler & Koch G11 during NATO trials.\n\n\"Cooking off\" is typically encountered only in fully automatic weapons, such as machine guns, when they are fired for long periods of time without allowing the barrel and chamber of the weapon to cool down to safe temperatures. For this reason, modern crew-served machine guns are equipped with spare barrels to allow a machine gun crew to replace an overheated barrel with a cool one, thus restoring the weapon to action while the overheated barrel is allowed to cool. Also, the majority of machine guns fire from an open bolt, so the round is chambered only after pressing the trigger, just before firing.\n\nA negligent discharge (ND) is a discharge of a firearm involving culpable carelessness. In judicial and military technical terms, a negligent discharge is a chargeable offence. A number of armed forces automatically consider any accidental discharge to be negligent discharge, under the assumption that a trained soldier has control of his firearm at all times. This is the case in the United States Army, Canadian Army, the Royal Air Force, the British Army and various Police Forces within the United Kingdom.\n\nFrom an article on a U.S. Air Force website:\n\n"}

Reports of this practice as a new fad surfaced in the media beginning in 2010, as hundreds of clips of persons purporting to engage in the practice were posted on YouTube. The practice is promoted by advocates as causing rapid intoxication, but it doesn't, because the amount of alcohol absorbed by the eye is low. Vodka eyeballing can cause corneal abrasions and scarring, promote angiogenesis in the eye (and thereby cause loss of vision), and increase the risk for eye infections, and has been condemned by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.\n\nSome observers maintained that the phenomenon was not a real craze, describing the coverage as a media feeding frenzy and part of \"a long history of trend pieces that come out of nowhere\". The initial press coverage in British tabloid The Daily Mail was criticized for basing its entire story on an injury from a single student stunt, and extrapolating this into a \"trend\" after a YouTube search showed hundreds of similar videos. Journalist Michael Strangelove said that the videos, which date back to 2006, seemed genuine and should not be dismissed as a deceptive \"prank\" against the media.\n\nThe 2000 comedy film \"Kevin & Perry Go Large\" includes a character called Eyeball Paul who engages in the practice.\n\nThe practice formed part of the plot of the February 6, 2013 episode of the Canadian TV fiction series \"Trauma\", leading to a young woman receiving (successful) cornea transplants.\n"}

The party is held in a house which was formerly a home for wayward children, that is haunted by the angry ghosts of children who were physically and emotionally abused by the Christian fundamentalist who managed the home.\n\nBuffy and Riley fight a vampire and a demon in the cemetery, finally disposing of both of them. While they intend to go tell Giles about the odd pairing of demon and vampire, they opt instead for sex at Riley's dorm at Lowell House. Riley gets up in the middle of the night, acting as if he hears something from the restroom. All he finds is a dripping faucet in the tub. Xander's driving an ice cream truck for his new job, and Anya rides along with him to complain about their diminishing relationship. Trying to convince her that there is nothing wrong with him or their relationship, Xander suggests they have sex right there in the truck. He doesn't realize that there is a group of kids waiting outside for their ice cream.\n\nThe gang talks about patrol the night before, and they realize that Adam is bringing the races of demons together. Buffy and Riley escape for some alone time, which is no secret to the rest of the gang. The two continue their sex romp through the night. While the rest of the house is freezing cold, Buffy and Riley continue to keep occupied, and warm. An initiative agent is badly burned when a fire in a fireplace bursts forth into the room. The next night, Spike jumps out at Anya in the streets, trying to scare her into giving him her money. At the party, Buffy and Riley are making eyes at each other from across the room while their friends attempt to talk to them. Spike and Anya bond over a couple beers at the Bronze, complaining about what it's like to be without their harmful demon powers.\n\nA guy is talking to a girl, when he places his hand on a wall and suddenly gets very excited. Xander flirts with a girl named Julie. Riley and Buffy escape upstairs to resume their own private party. Willow and Tara talk about horses, but Willow had a bad experience with them and she's very afraid of them. Willow touches Tara's knee, but Tara backs away, inexplicably disgusted with the gesture. Anya and Spike then arrive at the frat party and the two verbally gang up on Xander.\n\nA group is playing spin the bottle and Xander joins in. On Xander's turn, the bottle lands on Julie, and he kisses her on the cheek. She suddenly jumps him and starts kissing him aggressively. After she runs away, Xander follows and finds her in the closet cutting off her hair. Willow goes to the restroom looking for Tara and instead finds a body drowning in the bathtub. When she reaches for it, it disappears and reappears behind her. All this time, Buffy and Riley have barely come up for air, not even stopping when they hear Willow scream or the gang calling for them outside the door.\n\nThe house begins to shake violently, and vines begin to cover the walls. Forrest and Graham run downstairs for instructions from their commanding officers. A ghost, which resembles a girl, runs straight through Anya, via intangibility, and Spike is strapped to a chair. Spike breaks free of his bonds and everyone escapes outside. The gang goes to Giles for help and find him singing and playing the guitar at the Espresso Bar. He's surprisingly very good, which Willow, Tara, and Anya all find appealing.\n\nResearch leads them to information about the Lowell building, which used to be the old Lowell Home for Children. They find the woman, Genevieve Holt, who ran the children's home and she confesses that she rewarded the children when they were good and punished them when they were dirty. She'd cut off the hair of the girls who would preen their hair in the mirror in order to \"remove the temptation\" of vanity and \"baptized\" them by holding them under water in a bathtub. After leaving Ms. Holt's place, they conclude that a group of poltergeists is now releasing their pent up sexual energy thanks to the repetitive acts of sex by Buffy and Riley. When Buffy and Riley are drained of all their strength, they will die.\n\nWillow, Tara, and Giles perform a spell to stop the ghosts. Xander and Anya hack their way through the vines and try to reach Buffy and Riley. Anya is knocked across the house while Xander is dragged into the bathroom and held underwater. Anya makes her way upstairs to save Xander and they fight against the vines and finally open Riley's dorm. The next day, the gang talks about Giles's \"mid-life crisis\" and the consequences of Buffy and Riley's endless sex. Unconvincingly, Buffy and Riley say how horrible the experience was.\n\n\n\n\n"}
