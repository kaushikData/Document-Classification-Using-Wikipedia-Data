In the late 18th century a movement known as Romanticism began; it validated strong emotion as an authentic not of aesthetic experience, placing new emphasis on such emotions as trepidation, horror and terror and awe. Key ideas that sparked changes in philosophy were the fast progress of science; evolution, as postulated by Vanini, Diderot, Lord Monboddo, Erasmus Darwin, Lamarck, Goethe, and Charles Darwin; and what might now be called emergent order, such as the free market of Adam Smith within nation states. Pressures for egalitarianism, and more rapid change culminated in a period of revolution and turbulence that would see philosophy change as well.\n\nWith the tumultuous years of 1789–1815, European culture was transformed by revolution, war and disruption. By ending many of the social and cultural props of the previous century, the stage was set for dramatic economic and political change. European philosophy reflected on, participated in, and drove, many of these changes.\n\nThe last third of the 18th century produced a host of ideas and works which would both systematize previous philosophy, and present a deep challenge to the basis of how philosophy had been systematized. Immanuel Kant is a name that most would mention as being among the most important of influences, as is Jean-Jacques Rousseau. While both of these philosophers were products of the 18th century and its assumptions, they pressed at the boundaries. In trying to explain the nature of the state and government, Rousseau would challenge the basis of government with his declaration that \"Man is born free, but is everywhere in chains\". Kant, while attempting to preserve axiomic skepticism, was forced to argue that we do not see true reality, nor do we speak of it. All we know of reality is appearances. Since all we can see of reality is appearances, which are subject to certain necessary and subjective forms of perceptions, Kant postulates the idea of an unknowable (while at the same time limiting our use of science and the principle of causality to the appearances). Hegel's distinction between the unknowable and the circumstantially unknown can be seen as the beginnings of Hegel's rational system of the universe.\n\nYet another philosopher of the late Enlightenment that was influential in the 19th century was Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749–1827), whose formulation of nomological determinism is famous up to this day.\n\nThis is a partial list of schools of 19th-century philosophy (also known as late modern philosophy).\n\nOne of the first philosophers to attempt to grapple with Kant's philosophy was Johann Gottlieb Fichte, whose development of Kantian metaphysics became a source of inspiration for the Romantics. In \"Wissenschaftslehre\", Fichte argues that the self posits itself and is a self-producing and changing process.\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, a student of Fichte, continued to develop many of the same ideas and was also assimilated by the Romantics as something of an official philosopher for their movement. But it was another of Fichte's students, and former roommate of Schelling, who would rise to become the most prominent of the post-Kantian idealists: Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. His work revealed the increasing importance of historical thinking in German thought.\n\nArthur Schopenhauer, rejecting Hegel and also materialism, called for a return to Kantian transcendentalism, at the same time adopting atheism and determinism, amongst others. His secular thought became more popular in Europe in the second half of the 19th century, which coincided with the advents of Darwinism, positivism, Marxism and philological analysis of the Bible. \n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, an even more orthodox return to Kantian thought was espoused by a number of Neo-Kantian philosophers based in two main locations: the Marburg School and the Baden School. This trend of thought survived into the beginning of the next century, influencing 20th century philosophical movements such as Neopositivism and Phenomenology.\n\nOne of the most famous opponents of idealism in the first half of the German 19th century was Ludwig Feuerbach, who advocated materialism and atheism.\n\nIn early 19th century Britain, Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill promoted the idea that actions are right as they maximize happiness, and happiness alone.\n\nDeveloped by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in the mid-to-late-19th Century, Marxism is a sociopolitical and economic view based on the philosophy of dialectical materialism, which opposes idealism in favour of the materialist viewpoint. Marx analysed history itself as the progression of dialectics in the form of class struggle. From this it is argued that \"the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.\" According to Marx, this began with the phase of primitive communism (hunter-gatherer society), after which the Neolithic Revolution gave way to slave societies, progressing into the feudal society, and then into his present era of the Industrial Revolution, after which he held that the next step was for the proletariat to overthrow the owners of industry and establish a socialist society, which would further develop into a communist society, in which class distinctions, money, and the state would have withered from existence entirely.\n\nMarxism had a profound influence on the history of the 20th Century.\n\nExistentialism as a philosophical movement is properly a 20th-century movement, but its major antecedents, Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche wrote long before the rise of existentialism. In the 1840s, academic philosophy in Europe, following Hegel, was almost completely divorced from the concerns of individual human life, in favour of pursuing abstract metaphysical systems. Kierkegaard sought to reintroduce to philosophy, in the spirit of Socrates: subjectivity, commitment, faith, and passion, all of which are a part of the human condition.\n\nLike Kierkegaard, Nietzsche saw the moral values of 19th-century Europe disintegrating into nihilism (Kierkegaard called it the \"levelling\" process). Nietzsche attempted to undermine traditional moral values by exposing its foundations. To that end, he distinguished between master and slave moralities, and claimed that man must turn from the meekness and humility of Europe's slave-morality.\n\nBoth philosophers are precursors to existentialism, among other ideas, for their importance on the \"great man\" against the age. Kierkegaard wrote of 19th-century Europe, \"Each age has its own characteristic depravity. Ours is perhaps not pleasure or indulgence or sensuality, but rather a dissolute pantheistic contempt for the individual man.\"\n\nAuguste Comte, the self-professed founder of modern sociology, put forward the view that the rigorous ordering of confirmable observations alone ought to constitute the realm of human knowledge. He had hoped to order the sciences in increasing degrees of complexity from mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, and a new discipline called \"sociology\", which is the study of the \"dynamics and statics of society\".\n\nThe American philosophers Charles Sanders Peirce and William James developed the pragmatist philosophy in the late 19th century.\n\nThe twilight years of the 19th century in Britain saw the rise of British idealism, a revival of interest in the works of Kant and Hegel.\n\nTranscendentalism was rooted in Immanuel Kant's transcendence and German idealism, led by Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau. The main belief was in an ideal spiritual state that 'transcends' the physical and empirical and is only realized through the individual's intuition, rather than through the doctrines of established religions.\n\n\"Social Darwinism\" refers to theories that apply the evolutionary concept of natural selection to human society.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "240633", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=240633", "title": "Aegukga", "text": "Aegukga\n\n\"Aegukga\" (, ), often translated as \"The Patriotic Song\", is the national anthem of South Korea. It was adopted in 1948, the year the country was founded. Its music was composed in the 1930s and its lyrics date back to the 1890s. The lyrics of \"Aegukga\" were originally set to the music of the Scottish song \"Auld Lang Syne\" before Ahn Eak-tai composed a unique melody specifically for it in 1935. Before the founding of South Korea, the song's lyrics, set to the music of \"Auld Lang Syne\", was sung, as well as during Korea under Japanese rule by dissidents. The version set to the melody composed by Ahn Eak-tai was adopted as the national anthem of the Korean exile government, which existed during Korea's occupation by Japan from the early 1910s to the mid-1940s. \n\n\"Aegukga\" has four verses, but on most occasions only the first one is sung when performed publicly at events such as baseball games and soccer matches.\n\nThe \"Encyclopedia of Korean Culture\" defines \"Aegukga\" as \"the song to wake up the mind to love the country\". \"Aegukga\" in itself is differentiated from a national anthem. While a national anthem or \"gukga\" is an official symbol of the state, \"aegukga\" refers to any song, official or unofficial, that contains patriotic fervor towards its country, such as Hungary's \"Szózat\" or the U.S. \"The Stars and Stripes Forever\". However, the nationally designated \"Aegukga\" plays the role of symbolizing the country. In general shorthand, the term \"aegukga\" refers to the national anthem of South Korea. Nevertheless, there are still more than ten other extant \"Aegukgas\" in South Korea.\n\nIn the 1890s, the previously established Joseon dynasty began to contact other countries for the first time, including the United States, United Kingdom, and Russia. The meeting with foreign countries gave rise to patriotism, which then created several \"Aegugkas\". For instance, works in 1896 includes \"Aeguka\" created by Na Pil-gun, Han Myung-one, and Lee Yong-mu. On November 21, 1896, scholars from the Pai Chai school sang a version of \"Aegukga\" in the independence door ceremony. However, this song differs from the song sung by the Military Academy in 1898 and from the songs sung on the birthday of the former emperor.\n\nHowever, a book from the Korean Empire in 1900 has a record of a national anthem. It was called the \"Korean Empire Aegukga\", or literally the \"Anthem of the Greater Korean Empire\". The anthem is commonly believed to be written by Franz Eckert. Some people contend that records documenting Franz Eckert's actions show that it was physically impossible for him to write the anthem. It is guessed that the song sung by the Paejae school was the Scottish song \"Auld Lang Syne\" and that the song sung by the Military Academy is a version of the British song \"God Save the Queen\".\n\nThe song attributed to Eckert was established by the military in 1902. A version of Eckert's song with different lyrics began to be officially implemented in the schools in 1904. All the schools were forced to sing the version of the song. The policy is thought of as a by-product of the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1905 and the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1907.\n\nThere are many theories concerning the writer of the currently official lyrics of \"Aegukga\". It is most commonly believed that the lyrics were written for the cornerstone-laying ceremony of the Independence Gate in Seoul in 1896 by Yun Chi-ho, a Korean politician. Later, Kim Gu during the Korean government-in-exile era, said to his comrades: \"In the March 1st Movement, we had the Taegeukgi and the Aegukga. Why should who wrote it be an issue?\" He wrote: \"The lyrics and the anthem's spirit are more important than the nature of the lyricist.\" Other theories name the lyricist as An Chang-ho, Choi Byung-hun, Kim In-sik, Min Yeong-hwan, or some combination of the aforementioned writers. The \"Committee to search for the composer of 'Aegukga'\" was established in 1955 by the government on the request of the United States, but the committee concluded that there was not enough evidence to name a lyricist.\n\nInitially, \"Aegukga\" was sung to the tune of the Scottish folk song \"Auld Lang Syne\", introduced to Korea by western missionaries. The Provisional Korean Government (1919–1945) in Shanghai, China adopted it as their national anthem. At a ceremony celebrating the founding of South Korea on 15 August 1948, the Scottish tune was finally replaced by the Finale of \"Korea Fantasia\", which Ahn Eak-tai had composed in 1935. The new \"Aegukga\" was later adopted by the Presidential Decree of 1948 by the then South Korean President Syngman Rhee (or Lee Seungman).\n\nSince the composer Ahn Eak-tai died in 1965, the copyright for the music was to not expire until at least 2036. Two South Korean professional football clubs were sued by a copyright holders' group for playing this song in December 2003. However, on March 16, 2005, the composer's widow—Lolita Ahn—and her family relinquished all rights to \"Aegukga\" to the South Korean government. \"Aegukga\" has since become a public domain song.\nThe South Korean national anthem's lyrics have been criticized by some as being too focused on racial nationalism instead of civic republicanism, thus festering patriotism towards a \"Korean race\" rather than the South Korean state itself, possibly endangering South Korea's national security in the face of a North Korean military threat by festering sympathy for the North Korean regime.\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\nDonghaemulgwa baekdusani mareugo daltorok<br>\nHaneunimi bouhasa urinara manse.\n\nNamsan wie jeo sonamu cheolgabeul dureun deut<br>\nBaram seori bulbyeonhameun uri gisangilse.\n\nGaeul haneul gonghwalhande nopgo gureum eopsi<br>\nBalgeun dareun uri gaseum ilpyeondansimilse.\n\nI gisanggwa i mameuro chungseongeul dahayeo<br>\nGoerouna jeulgeouna nara saranghase.\n\nUntil that day when Mt.

It was created on September 15, 2014, and is responsible for Alberta's cultural industries, tourism, the arts, heritage and nonprofit/voluntary sector as well as sport and recreation.\n\nThe culture, tourism, and recreation functions of Alberta's government have on several occasions in past been overseen by separate ministers. They have also been, more than once, sections within the portfolio of the same minister. They have also each been joined to still other government departments at various points.\n\nA separate tourism ministry goes back at least to 1968 when Allen R. Patrick was named Minister of Industry and Tourism. From 1971 to 1975, tourism as an issue was assigned to a minister without a portfolio, and there was no separate tourism department. In 1979 Tourism and Small Business became a separate ministry, renamed simply \"Tourism\" in 1985. In the major restructuring of 1992, Tourism was reunited with Economic Development; Parks and Recreation was added as well. This situation was mostly static for the next two decades. The ministry was known as Alberta Tourism, Parks, and Recreation (TPR) from 2006 to 2014.\n\nCulture and recreation were (along with youth issues) together under the purview of the Ministry of Culture, Youth and Recreation from 1971 to 1975, after which recreation moved to Alberta Recreation, Parks and Wildlife, which was its own ministry from 1975 to 1992, before being merged into Tourism during the major restructuring of that year.\n\nThe Cultural Affairs Department was founded in 1975 by Order in Council 518/1975, under the authority of the \"Public Service Administrative Transfers Act\". The minister responsible for this was known as the Minister Responsible for Culture (1975–1980), Minister of Culture (1980–1987), and Minister of Culture and Multiculturalism (1987–1992).\n\nAgencies which reported to the minister included the Alberta Cultural Heritage Foundation (1978–1987), Alberta Multiculturalism Commission (1987–1992), Alberta Art Foundation (1972–1991), Alberta Foundation for the Performing Arts (1978–1991), Alberta Foundation for the Literary Arts (1984–1991), Alberta Foundation for the Arts (1991–1992), Alberta Library Board (1948–1992), and Alberta Advisory Council on the Status of Women (1986–1987). During this time the minister was responsible for implementing the following legislation: Alberta Academy Act, Alberta Art Foundation Act, Alberta Emblems Act, Alberta Foundation for the Arts Act, Alberta Heritage Day Act, Alberta Historical Resources Act, Alberta Order of Excellence Act, Alberta Women's Bureau Act, \"Amusements Act\" (Part 3), Cultural Development Act, Cultural Foundations Act, Department of Culture Act, Department of Culture and Multiculturalism Act, Foreign Cultural Property Immunity Act, Glenbow-Alberta Institute Act, Government House Act, Libraries Act, and Registered Music Teachers' Association Act.\n\nDuring the 1992 restructuring the former Department of Culture and Multiculturalism and former Department of Tourism, Parks, and Recreation were dissolved and replaced by the Ministry of Community Development. This contained all of the current components of the ministry (along with parks). From 2006 to 2008 this ministry was renamed Alberta Tourism, Parks, Recreation and Culture. On March 12, 2008 culture was broken out in a new ministry called Alberta Culture and Community Spirit (it was renamed simply Alberta Culture on May 8, 2012).\n\nIn 2014, Culture was reunited with Tourism (including recreation), but this time without Alberta Parks, which moved to the Ministry of Environment and Parks.\n\n the ministry includes Travel Alberta, the tourism marketing agency of the ministry, the Alberta Sport, Recreation, Parks and Wildlife Foundation, also known as Alberta Sport Connection, as a non-profit Crown corporation, the Alberta Foundation for the Arts, Alberta Historical Resources Foundation, and Government House Foundation.\n\nTravel Alberta divided the province into five tourism regions:\n\n"}

It is a sequel to \"Alien vs. Predator\" (2004) and the second and latest installment in the \"Alien vs. Predator\" franchise, continuing the crossover of the \"Alien\" and \"Predator\" franchises. The film was released on December 25, 2007. It has an 11% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes and grossed $129 million, behind the predecessor, which grossed $172 million.\n\nFollowing the events of the previous film, a Predator ship leaves Earth carrying Alien facehuggers, and the body of Scar, the Predator that defeated the Alien Queen. A chestburster with traits of both species erupts from Scar's body. It quickly matures into an adult Predalien and starts killing the Predators on board (in the extended cut, this happens on a scout ship that has been detached from the mother ship). A Predator's weapon punctures the hull and the ship crashes in the forest outside of Gunnison, Colorado, killing all but one of the Predators, who's severely injured.\n\nThe Predalien and several facehuggers escape, implanting embryos into a nearby father and son who are out hunting in the forest, as well as several homeless people that live in the sewers. The injured Predator sends a distress signal before being killed by the Predalien. On the Predator homeworld, a skilled veteran Predator, Wolf, receives the signal and takes it upon himself to travel to Earth to hunt and kill the Aliens. He arrives at the crashed Predator ship, uses a blue acid-like liquid to dissolve and erase evidence of the Aliens' presence, and triggers an explosion to further destroy the vessel.\n\nMeanwhile, ex-convict Dallas Howard has just returned to Gunnison after serving time in prison. He is greeted by Sheriff Eddie Morales and reunites with his younger brother Ricky. Ricky has a romantic interest in his classmate Jesse, but is constantly harassed by her boyfriend Dale and his two friends. Kelly O'Brien has also just returned to Gunnison after serving in the military, and reunites with her husband Tim and daughter Molly. Darcy Benson, the wife of the murdered father, begins her search for her missing husband and son. Meanwhile, local waitress Carrie Adams discovers she is pregnant, but her police officer husband, Ray, is killed by Wolf after witnessing him dissolving the bodies of Darcy's husband and son while he was searching for them in the forest.\n\nWolf tracks several Aliens in the sewer and defeats many of them, and as the battle reaches the surface, several of them disperse into the town. Wolf pursues some to the power plant, where collateral damage from his plasma caster weapon causes a citywide power outage. Ricky and Jesse meet at the high school swimming pool, but are interrupted by Dale and his cohorts just as the power goes out and an Alien enters the pool, killing Dale's friends. Another Alien invades the O'Brien home, killing Tim while Kelly escapes with Molly. After the fry cook at the local diner where Carrie works is attacked by the Aliens, Carrie is also attacked after hearing the cook's screams and is impregnated by the Predalien with bellybusters. Darcy discovers her body in horror but Sheriff Morales arrives and brings her with him.\n\nKelly, Molly, Ricky, Jesse, Dale, Dallas, and Sheriff Morales gather at a sporting goods store to collect weapons. Troops from the Colorado Army National Guard arrive, but are quickly killed by the Aliens. Wolf briefly captures Dallas inside the store to use as bait to lure the Aliens, but Dallas escapes. Several Aliens arrive and Wolf handily defeats them. Dale is killed by an Alien during the battle and one of Wolf's shoulder plasma casters is damaged. He removes his remaining one and modifies it into a hand-held blaster.\n\nAs the survivors attempt to escape Gunnison, they make radio contact with Colonel Stevens and are told that an air evacuation is being staged at the center of town. Dallas and Kelly are skeptical, as going to the center of town would cause them to become surrounded by the Aliens, and they along with Ricky, Jesse, Molly and a few others, go for the helicopter at the hospital to get out of town while Sheriff Morales and Darcy head to the evacuation zone. However, the hospital has been invaded and overrun by the Aliens and the Predalien, who has impregnated some pregnant women to breed more Aliens. Wolf soon arrives at the hospital where he dispatches more Aliens and during the battle, the Predator accidentally impales Jesse with one of his Shuriken weapons; distraught, Ricky rushes Wolf with his rifle fire only to be injured by the Predalien. The Predator is attacked by an Alien, and both tumble down an elevator shaft. Dallas takes possession of Wolf's plasma blaster.\n\nDallas, Ricky, Kelly and Molly reach the roof and fight off several Aliens before escaping in the helicopter, while Wolf, having survived the fall, battles the Predalien on the roof in hand-to-hand combat. Wolf and the Predalien mortally wound each other just as a military jet arrives. Rather than a rescue airlift, it executes a tactical nuclear strike that levels the entire city, instantly killing Sheriff Morales, Darcy, and everyone else gathered at ground zero. The shock wave causes the fleeing helicopter to crash in a clearing, where the survivors are rescued by the military. Wolf's plasma blaster is confiscated, and Colonel Stevens presents it to Ms. Yutani. Yutani tells him that the world is not yet ready for this kind of advanced technology.\n\n\n\n\nBobby \"Slim\" Jones (\"Bull\") and Ian Feuer (\"Atomic\") as the additional Predators. \nInspired by \"\", brothers Colin and Greg Strause moved to Los Angeles to break into the film business. After an unsuccessful attempt to find employment at Industrial Light & Magic, the brothers worked on \"The X-Files\" film in 1998 and founded their own special effects company, Hydraulx. The company produced special effects for films such as \"Volcano\", \"Titanic\", \"The Day After Tomorrow\", \"Poseidon\" and \"300\" and the brothers began a career directing commercials and music videos. Colin believes Hydraulx secured a strong relationship with 20th Century Fox, which owns the \"Alien\" and \"Predator\" franchises.\n\nThe brothers unsuccessfully pitched an idea for the first \"Alien vs. Predator\" film and Fox almost bought a film titled \"Wolfenstein\" suggested by the brothers, \"When the script came up for this movie, they thought we'd be perfect for it because it's an ambitious movie for the budget that they had and they knew that having our visual effects background was going to be a huge thing.\" The brothers were hired to direct the sequel to \"Alien vs. Predator\" in late spring 2006 and had limited time to start filming in the fall. The film's original title was \"Alien vs. Predator: Survival of the Fittest\", but was later dropped.\n\nFilming on \"Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem\" on September 25, 2006 in Vancouver, Canada. on a 52-day schedule. During filming breaks, the brothers supervised visual effects work on \"300\", \"Shooter\" and \"The Invasion\" by using in-house supervisors and a system called \"Mavis and Lucy\", which let the brothers track, view and approve dailies. Colin estimates Hydraulx produced 460 of the 500 visual effects shots including the nuclear explosion which was created using Maya fluids and BA Volume Shader. The interior of the Predator ship was created using CGI, as the brothers felt it would be more cost effective than building a set. The visual effects team peaked at 110 people for several months and averaged 70, almost all of the entire Hydraulx staff.\n\nUsing their knowledge in visual effects and making use of principal photography, the brothers tried to film as much as they could on camera without resorting to CGI, Colin said \"other than the exterior spaceship shots, there are no pure CG shots.\" CGI was used for the Alien tails and inner jaws, whereas they required puppeteers and wire removal on previous films. The main visual effects of the film included set design, a nuclear explosion, the Predator's ship crashing and the Predator cloak, about which Colin stated \"We wanted to make sure it didn't look too digital.\" \n\nAs a side-note, in the DVD commentary the brothers explained that they want actor Adam Baldwin to reprise his role as Garber in \"Predator 2\", but unable to do so, instead using Robert Joy as a new character. Additionally, while the previous installment attracted casual moviegoers as well as fans of the franchises, the film catered exclusively to \"Alien\" and \"Predator\" fans with many references to the previous films appearing in the film.\n\nComposer Brian Tyler, was hired to the score for the film. The film's main theme track is a clash of two main themes, one consisting of the Predator type theme (bongos and basses) and the second of the Aliens (high pitched violins, violas and flutes). The directors Colin and Greg Strause wanted to take a new direction from Harald Kloser's \"Alien vs. Predator\" score and wanted Tyler to use some reference to the three films' original score pieces, such as the horrific violas and percussion from James Horner's \"Aliens\" and the primitive tribal percussion from Alan Silvestri's \"Predator\" and \"Predator 2\". Tyler also referenced composer John Frizzel's \"\" into the score, in the tracks of \"Down to Earth\" and \"Taking Sides\". The soundtrack album was released on December 11, 2007 by Varèse Sarabande. \"Grim Discovery\" and \"The Chopper\", the two tracks from \"Predator\" was listed in the film's end credits, both written and composed by Silvestri. They were never included in the \"Predator\" soundtrack and the film's soundtrack, but can be found on YouTube.\n\n\"Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem \" was released in the United States on Christmas Day 2007, in 2,563 theaters. It was rated R for violence, gore and language, unlike its predecessor, which was given a PG-13 rating. The BBFC's classification decision for the film is the same as the original (Rated 15), whilst the Australian ACB rated the film MA15+, up from the original's M rating.\n\nThe film grossed $9,515,615 on its opening day for an average of $3,707 per theater and was number six at the box office. It grossed $5 million in Australia, $9 million in Japan and the United Kingdom and $7 million in Russia, and had an international total of $86,288,761. As of February 24, 2009, the film had taken in a domestic gross of $41,797,066 and an international gross of $87,087,428, bringing it to a total of $128,884,494. It is the lowest grossing \"Alien\" film in the domestic box office and is the second lowest grossing \"Alien\" film worldwide, next to the original \"Alien\", and the lowest overall in either series when inflation is considered.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 11% based on reviews from 70 critics. The website's consensus states: \"The increased gore and violence over the first \"Alien vs. Predator\" can't excuse \"Requiem\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s disorienting editing, excessively murky lighting, and lack of new ideas.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 29 out of 100, based on reviews from 14 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of \"C\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nChris Hewitt of \"Empire\" called it an \"early but strong contender for worst movie of 2008\". Stina Chyn of \"Film Threat\" felt the camerawork \"is a smidge too shaky and the lighting/color design too dark for me to relish the Predator-on-Alien butt-kicking\". Josh Rosenblatt of \"The Austin Chronicle\" dismissed the film stating it was \"An orgy of mindless violence, a random collection of bloody bodies, alien misanthropy and slobbering carnage designed to bore straight into the pleasure centers of 13-year-old boys and leave the rest of us wondering when the movies got so damn loud.\" Kirk Honeycutt of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" contributor called it a \"dull actioner that looks like a bad video game\".\n\nChris Nashawaty of \"Entertainment Weekly\" felt it was a \"B movie that truly earns its B,\" and gave it a grading of \"B\" on an A to F scale. \"Variety\" contributor Joe Leydon said it \"Provides enough cheap thrills and modest suspense to shake a few shekels from genre fans before really blasting off as homevid product\". Ryan Stewart of \"Cinematical\" said he \"can't recommend it as a good movie on its own merits, stocked as it is with cardboard cutout characters and a barely coherent plot, but it's miles more interesting than the last \"Alien vs. Predator\" film.\" \n\nThere was the occasional positive review; Neil Genzlinger of \"The New York Times\" stated \"It may not be classic sci-fi like the original \"Alien\", which it has in its DNA, but it's a perfectly respectable next step in the series.\" \n\n\"Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem\" was nominated for two Golden Raspberry awards in the fields of Worst Excuse for a Horror Movie and Worst Prequel or Sequel. The awards went to \"I Know Who Killed Me\" and \"Daddy Day Camp\", respectively.\n\nOn May 8, 2008, the film was nominated for an MTV Movie Award for Best Fight Sequence, but lost to \"Never Back Down\".\n\n\"Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on April 15, 2008 in North America and May 12, 2008 in the United Kingdom by Fox Home Entertainment. It was released in three versions: a single-disc, R-rated version of the 94-minute theatrical presentation, a single-disc unrated version extended to 101 minutes and a two-disc unrated version with the 101 minute film and a second disc of special features. Extra features on the single-disc editions include two audio commentary tracks: one by the directors and producer John Davis and a second by creature effects designers and creators Tom Woodruff Jr. and Alec Gillis.\n\nDisc one of the two-disc unrated edition includes both commentary tracks as well as both cuts of the film seamlessly branched and an exclusive \"Weyland-Yutani archives\" picture-in-picture reference guide to the warring alien races; five behind-the-scenes featurettes: \"Prepare for War: Development & Production\", \"Fight to the Finish\", \"The Nightmare Returns: Creating the Aliens\", \"Crossbreed: The Predalien\" and \"Building the Predator Homeworld\"; multiple galleries of still photos showing the creature designs and sets; and the film's theatrical trailer. The second disc includes a \"digital copy\" download feature.\n\nIn its first week of release, \"Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem\" debuted at number two on the DVD charts, earning $7.7 million and number one on the Blu-ray charts. The film has made $27,403,705 in DVD sales in the United States.\n\nDuring the production Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem The Brothers Strause expressed plans for a Third Alien vs. Predator installment. \nBut after the negative reception and underwhelming box office results the planned sequel was shelved. The Alien and Predator franchises would continue separately with Ridley Scott's Prometheus, , Nimrod Antal's Predators and Shane Black's The Predator.\n\n"}

The treasure principally consists of silver tableware and jewellery, most of which is now held at the British Museum.\n\nThe hoard was unearthed in the nineteenth century at the Hill of St Louis in Carthage, which at the time of its deposition was the largest city of Africa Proconsulare. Most of the treasure was purchased by Sir Augustus Wollaston Franks, a senior curator at the British Museum, who bequeathed it to the museum upon his death in 1897. However, a small part of the treasure can be found in the Louvre, including one of the silver covered bowls.\n\nDating to the second half of the fourth century AD, the Carthage Treasure comprises 31 different objects, primarily luxury silver tableware and jewellery that must have belonged to a wealthy Roman family who for some reason decided to bury it for safe-keeping. This may have been because of the religious feud around the year 400 but it is more likely that the treasure was hidden from the Vandals. The Vandals, led by Gaiseric, invaded Africa Proconsulare from Spain in 429 and in 439 the city became capital of the Vandal Kingdom. Inscribed in the centre of one of the dishes around the tondo is D D ICRESCONI CLARENT, which is associated with the Cresconii, a powerful Roman North African family in Carthage who are well known from deeds and records of office-holders at this time.\n\nThe treasure includes a pair of flat dishes (one of which identifies the family), two bowls with chased and hammered pastoral scenes in relief around the edge, four hemispherical bowls with high tapering feet (two of which still have their covers), a shallow bowl with handle and frog engraved in the centre, twelve silver spoons, and a mixed collection of jewellery: a finger ring, a cameo, a pair of ear rings, several intaglios and two necklaces, one made of gold, the other with precious stones. The jewelled necklace consists of twelve polygonal emeralds, thirteen sapphires, matched by twenty five pearls all joined by gold links.\n\nThe family would have owned two collections of silver: One known as \"argentum potorium\" that was the drinking set and another for eating called the \"argentum escarium\". Amongst this find were several silver hemispherical lidded bowls that measure 12 cm high and 12 cm in diameter. The vessels' elegant design includes a tall base that complements the knop of the bowl's lid. The bowls also incorporate subtle facets on the lids' curved surfaces. Similar bowls have been found at the Roman site of Viminacium near the modern town of Kostolac in Serbia.\n\n\n"}

The film is a remake of 2004 Thai horror film Shutter.\n\nAvi is an ace photographer who is in a live-in relationship with Sonia, a model. One night while returning from a party, the couple accidentally knocks down a young girl with their speeding car. As Sonia was driving the car, to avoid further complications, Avi insists on them fleeing from the accident scene. But trouble starts for the couple soon after. While strange white marks begin to appear in Avi's photos, Sonia starts having spooky experiences. Avi also develops a severe neck pain and even though he does not appear to be overweight, a scale reveals that he weighs 120 kilograms. Avi, too, starts having experiences similar to Sonia's.\nThe couple is petrified when all of Avi's best friends commit suicide in a similar manner. It then comes to light that the spirit haunting them all has a connection to Avi's college life. Meanwhile, Sonia finds out that Avi was friends with a girl named Aarti during his college days. As Avi and Sonia are still being haunted by Aarti they go and visit her, but realize that Aarti is dead, having apparently committed suicide by using a knife. Aarti's mother believes that she is still alive, thinking that she is merely ill and will recover.\nOn the way home Aarti continues to haunt Avi and Sonia, and again during the night at the hotel she also haunts him as Avi is sleeping, ending up with him being thrown off the fire escape.\n\nLater Avi is in the hospital and Sonia tells him that Aarti will be cremated, and they visit her funeral before returning to their home town. Sonia finds some photos of Aarti, where she is crawling to get something. As she follows the pattern indicated by Aarti, Sonia discovers that Avi's best friends (who later committed suicide) are raping Aarti.\nWhen Sonia talks to Avi about this dark secret, he tells her that he only wanted Aarti to understand his feelings, but that when his best friends tried to talk to her, Aarti hurt Avi's friend Tarun, who became angry and with his friends raped her. Avi claims that when he entered the room he was shocked at the scene and tried to help her, but that Tarun then said that Avi had asked them to rape her as a way of avoiding jail, and accused Avi of planning to do this to her and having one of Avi's friends taking the pictures.\nAvi then tells Sonia that the reason he kept the photos was to remind him that he failed to protect Aarti and say he is the guilty one. But Sonia leaves him and wishes him that Aarti may forgive him. Later on Avi attempts to kill himself in the same way his best friends did, but as a Polaroid camera clicks towards him, he sees Aarti sitting on his shoulders. Avi is suddenly thrown through the window, and ends up in hospital, where it is revealed that the reason why she was sitting on his shoulders was that Aarti had still loved Avi.\nAs Sonia makes another photograph of Avi, she speaks to Aarti, asserting that one day she will let go as the reflection in the mirror shows Aarti still leaning on Avi's back.\n\n\nThe Music Was Composed By Shamir Tandon and Released by T-Series. All Lyrics were penned by Shabbir Ahmed.\n\nThe film grossed INR 1.36 crore and was a box office flop.\n\nThe film was later dubbed and released in Tamil as \"Monica House\" during January 2016.\n\n"}

{"id": "44358983", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44358983", "title": "Cultural effects of the Ebola crisis", "text": "Cultural effects of the Ebola crisis\n\nThe Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa has had a large effect on the culture of most of the West African countries. In most instances, the effect is a rather negative one as it has disrupted many Africans’ traditional norms and practices. For instance, many West African communities rely on traditional healers and witch doctors, who use herbal remedies, massage, chant, and witchcraft to cure just about any ailment. Therefore, it is difficult for West Africans to adapt to foreign medical practices. Specifically, West African resistance to Western medicine is prominent in the region, which calls for severe distrust of Western and modern medical personnel and practices.\n\nSimilarly, some African cultures have a traditional solidarity of standing by the sick, which is contrary to the safe care of an Ebola patient. This tradition is known as \"standing by the ill\" in order to show one's respect and honor to the patient. According to the Wesley Medical Center, these sorts of traditional norms can be dangerous to those not infected with the virus as it increases their chances of coming in contract with their family member's bodily fluids. In Liberia, Ebola has wiped out entire families, leaving perhaps one survivor to recount stories of how they simply could not be hands off while their loved ones were sick in bed, because of their culture of touch, hold, hug and kiss.\n\nSome communities traditionally use folklore and mythical literature, which is often passed on verbally from one generation to the next to explain the interrelationships of all things that exist. However the folklore and songs are not only of traditional or ancient historical origins, but are often about current events that have affected the community. Additionally, folklore and music will often take opposing sides of any story. Thus early in the Ebola epidemic, the song \"White Ebola\" was released by a diaspora based group and centers on the general distrust of \"outsiders\" who may be intentionally infecting people.\n\nThis initial misinformation increased the general distrust in foreigners, and the idea that Ebola was not in Africa before their arrival led to attacks on many health workers as well as blockages of aid convoys blocked from checking remote areas. A burial team, which was sent in to collect the bodies of suspected Ebola victims from West Point in Liberia, was blocked by several hundred residents chanting: \"No Ebola in West Point.\" Health ministries and workers started an aggressive Ebola information campaign on all media formats to properly inform the residents and allow aid workers safe access to the high risk areas. In Guinea, riots broke out after medics disinfected a market in Nzerekore. Locals rumored that the medics were actually spreading the disease. In nearby Womey, 8 people distributing information about Ebola were killed by the villagers.\n\nThe Ebola epidemic of 2014 has forced West Africans to face numerous difficulties on daily basis regarding their traditional norms and practices. In essence, their traditions have been severely disrupted due to the Ebola virus. For instance, Africans have had the tendency to remain close to their sick family members to nurse them during illness for centuries. Unfortunately for the African community, many have been encouraged to keep their distance from their infected family members as potential contact could be fatal. In addition, it is part of their culture to touch the deceased at funerals and for the sister of the deceased’s father to bathe, clean, and dress the corpse in a favorite outfit. When there is not an aunt to perform this task, a female elder in their community is then held responsible. Not only is it customary to wash and touch the deceased, but also to kiss those that have passed.\n\nSpecifically, funerals are considered to be major cultural events for families and friends to gather around to celebrate the deceased. The funeral performances, which involve wailing and dancing, is done out of care and respect for the dead. Funerals in Africa often last for several days, depending on the status of the person who died. In other words, the more important the person who died was while they were alive, the longer the mourning will last. More importantly, there is a common bowl used for ritual hand-washing towards the end of the ceremony, including a final kiss or touch on the face, which is to be bestowed on the dead. This is commonly referred to as a \"love touch.\" The Wesley Medical Center has confirmed that prohibiting African families from performing such rites is a disgrace as it insults the deceased, putting the remaining family in danger. Specifically, it is believed that the dead person’s spirit, also known as \"tibo,\" will cause harm and bring illness to the family as a result of an improper burial.\n\nResistance to Western medicine is considered to be a significant barrier to battling the Ebola virus. The Wesley Medical Center claims that the interference with African burial rituals caused by Western medical practices has prohibited them from properly honoring their loved ones. They believe that this may have been a reason for heightened distrust in medical professionals, and that the mistrust enhances each time family members of infected persons are prohibited from participating in the funeral or seeing the dead body in person. Due to the mistrust Ebola-stricken communities in Liberia reportedly hid family members with Ebola from health care providers and held secret burials. In Sierra Leone health workers made more progress because health measures were implemented according to WHO guidance, which advises health workers to heed the traditions of the threatened communities when attending to the dead. Therefore, funerals were held in agreement with the wishes of the families, but also gave health workers an opportunity to disinfect the bodies. In many of the Ebola infected areas in Africa, Western medicine is also believed either to be ineffective or to be the actual origin of the virus. In other words, there is a belief among the African community that Western doctors are intentionally killing their patients with their treatments. A conspiracy theory also says that the medical professionals are planning to harvest the organs of those dying from Ebola.\n\nResistance to Western medicine exists also because of the look of the hazmat suits, which are worn by healthcare workers to protect themselves from becoming infected with the Ebola virus. The protective equipment is said to frighten many West Africans and also believed to be hostile and intimidating to the African families. Lastly, the interference in the family’s care for the patient diminishes the honor of the patient as well as hindering the family’s duty to provide comfort and care. Regardless of the existing resistance towards Western medicine, handling the bodies of the deceased poses a high risk of contagion as Ebola is contracted through physical contact with an infected person’s bodily fluids. This is mainly because preparation for burial includes touching, washing, and kissing as is mentioned above. Those that are preparing for the funeral can become easily infected as they can easily become exposed to the infected person’s blood, vomit, diarrhea, and other bodily fluids as these are the main symptoms of the virus.\n\nApart from the fact that traditional African healers have been using ritual and herbal remedies for many centuries, the African people also trust these treatments and find the costs more affordable. Traditional procedures include the following: magic, biomedical methods, fasting, dieting, herbal therapies, bathing, massage, as well as surgery. Surgical procedures often involve cutting a patient’s skin with unsterilized knives. Sometimes, traditional healers apply blood to the skin to rid them of their sickness. Despite the severe distrust of Africans in modern medicine, the Ebola virus has been said to spread rampantly across West Africa due to a shortage of healthcare workers and limited medical resources and facilities. The unsanitary conditions in the overall African region have also made it easier for Ebola to spread.\n\nAlakey Osei, a student and bank-teller from Freetown, Sierra Leone, described the Sierra Leonean capital as a ghost-town, as a result of the increasing death toll in the West African region caused by the Ebola epidemic. Osei states that \"everyone is scared to be out of their houses. No one is going to church or mosque, no one is going to work, the kids are not going to school, [and] people are not even going to the market place\". The fact that the city of Freetown has been completely abandoned is foreign to the student, because the nation is and has always been heavily reliant on physical contact and very close interaction. Osei has indicated that following the no touching rule that the medical personnel have been promoting is extremely difficult for her. Osei continues by saying that she does not even know how her people are surviving.\n\nIn her interview, Osei provides some insight about her childhood. She moved to US in 2008 when she was thirteen years old. She experienced extensive bullying for her obliviousness to American culture and simply for being the \"uncivilized\" African. For example, others had asked her if she was getting accustomed to wearing shoes since people do not wear shoes in Africa. She was also called names, such as monkey and pre-historic. As a result of this cruelty, she began to believe that American culture was very cold. She also noticed that Americans were \"protective of their property\", space, and time. She concluded that American society is \"extremely individualistic\". This truly made her miss living in Africa, \"... where every woman is your mother and every man is your father, ... where you are never alone, because everyone is family and family is all around you\".\n\nAs of October 2014, the Ebola virus had not reached her home-town back in Sierra Leone; however, she said that her family still living in the country claimed that Freetown did not \"feel like the same place\" anymore. Her aunt had told her that people were not sharing food anymore nor spending time at each other's houses as they used to because of the fear of becoming infected. Osei finds it heart-breaking that people in Sierra Leone have turned to isolation as a way to stay Ebola-free. Osei now says that \"Freetown has become Fear-town\", and that \"Ebola has turned us into prisoners in our own country\".\n\nThe Ebola virus, for which the primary host is suspected to be fruit bats, has been linked to bushmeat, which is commonly consumed in areas of West Africa that use it as a protein source. Although primates and other species may be intermediates, evidence suggests people primarily get the virus from bats. Hunters usually shoot, net, scavenge or catapult their prey, and butcher the bats without gloves, getting bites or scratches and coming in contact with their blood.\n\nIn 2014, the suspected index case for the Ebola outbreak in West Africa is a two-year-old child in Guéckédou in south-eastern Guinea, who was the child of a family that hunted two species of fruit bat, \"Hypsignathus monstrosus\" and \"Epomops franqueti\". Some researchers suggested the case was caused by zoonotic transmission though the child playing with an insectivorous bat from a colony of Angolan free-tailed bats near the village.\n\nDespite health organisations warning about risks of bushmeat, surveys pre-dating the 2014 outbreak indicate that people who eat bushmeat are usually unaware of the risks and view it as healthy food. Because of bushmeat's role as a protein source in Western Africa, it is traditionally associated with good nutrition, and efforts to outlaw the sale and consumption of bushmeat have been impossible to enforce and have met with suspicion from rural communities. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that between 30 and 80 percent of protein intake in rural households in Central Africa comes from wild meat.\n\nOne major Nigerian newspaper published a report about the widespread view that eating dog meat was a healthy alternative to bush meat. Dog meat was implicated in a June 2015 Liberian outbreak of Ebola, where three villagers who had tested positive for the disease had shared a meal of dog meat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a number of Ebola-themed jokes circulating in West Africa to spread awareness.\n\nIn July 2014 the Liberian Football Association made an announcement that all soccer related activities would be put on hold \"\"indefinitely to protect players and fans\".\" In September 2014, in a joint venture between FIFA and WHO, the Antoinette Tubman Stadium was converted into an Ebola treatment center.\n\nThe 2015 African Cup of Nations (AFCON) was temporarily put on hold when the original hosts, Morocco, asked the Confederation of African Football (CAF) to postpone the final games till 2016, due to the Ebola outbreak. CAF eventually moved the finals to Equatorial Guinea, which eliminated Morocco from the game as hosts, and brought Equatorial Guinea in, even though they had been eliminated prior.\n\nHowever the qualifiers for 2015 AFCON have been influenced by many countries' fear of Ebola, with many refusing to enter or allow entry of teams from affected countries. In July 2014, Seychelles refused entry to the Sierra Leone team. CAF ruled that Seychelles forfeited the game, giving Sierra Leone an automatic pass to the next stage. Lesotho refused to send the Under-20 team to Nigeria. CAF again ruled that Lesotho forfeited the game, sending Nigeria through to the finals.\n\nIn August 2014, CAF also decided to forbid any official games in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. For Liberia, who had already been eliminated, this was not of concern. Sierra Leone managed to move some home games to the visiting teams home; both home and away games against DR Congo were played in Lubumbashi, and both games against Cameroon were played in Yaounde. Guinea managed to get their home games moved to Casablanca, Morocco.\n\nEven after calls to have the 2015 AFCON postponed, the Equatorial Guinea government and CAF organisers have downplayed these concerns, and insisted that they would have ample measures in place, including: \n\nOn 7 August 2014 a social media hoax message was doing the rounds in Nigeria. It urged readers to \"bath with hot water and salt before daybreak\" and to drink as much of it as possible. On 8 August the person who started the joke message to see how many of their friends would fall for it, identified it as such and posted an apology. The hoax message quickly went viral when \"several gullible, unsophisticated opinion leaders\" repeated the hoax message. Within days many were hospitalized due to excessive salt intake, with 2 deaths in Jos, Plateau, 2 deaths in Makurdi, Benue and at least 3 deaths in Bauchi.\n\nIt is ironic that these deaths all happened in states that had no known EVD infected people. In fact only Lagos State and Rivers State had any infected. Furthermore, the unconfirmed death toll of the hoax cure is as many as the EVD death toll for Nigeria, with 8 deaths each.\n\nIn two separate incidents in October, flights have been delayed from disembarking because of an Ebola joke. On 8 October 2014, US Airways flight 845 from Philadelphia to Punta Cana, Dominican Republic was held up for two hours on the tarmac when an American passenger sneezed, then announced \"I have Ebola. You're all screwed,\" during the flight. After landing, he was escorted off the plane by four emergency personnel wearing blue hazmat suits, and detained until medical tests cleared him. On 30 October 2014, during the Aer Lingus flight EI 433, from Milan, Italy to Dublin, Ireland a passenger wrote \"'Attenzione Ebola'\" (\"Attention Ebola\") on a coffee lid before handing it to his daughter. The container and lid were discreetly disposed of, however a flight attendant noticed, and alerted the captain. The passenger was arrested, and later pleaded guilty to \"engaging in threatening, abusive or insulting behavior on an airplane contrary to the Air Navigation and Transport Act\", and was fined 2500 euros.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8569", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8569", "title": "Duke Nukem 3D", "text": "Duke Nukem 3D\n\nDuke Nukem 3D is a first-person shooter video game developed by 3D Realms. It is a sequel to the platform games \"Duke Nukem\" and \"Duke Nukem II\", published by 3D Realms.\n\n\"Duke Nukem 3D\" features the adventures of the titular Duke Nukem, voiced by Jon St. John, who fights against an alien invasion on Earth. Along with \"Wolfenstein 3D\" and \"Doom\", \"Duke Nukem 3D\" is considered to be responsible for popularizing first-person shooters, and was released to major acclaim. Reviewers praised the interactivity of the environments, gameplay, level design, and unique risqué humor, a mix of pop-culture satire and lampooning of over-the-top Hollywood action heroes. The game's violent nature, erotic elements, and portrayal of women incited controversy.\n\nThe shareware version of the game was originally released on January 29, 1996, while the full version was released on April 19, 1996 as version 1.3d. The \"Plutonium PAK\", an expansion pack which updated the game to version 1.4 and added a fourth eleven-level episode, was released in November 1996. The \"Atomic Edition\", a standalone version of the game that included the content from the \"Plutonium PAK\" and updated the game to version 1.5, was later released; the original version of \"Duke Nukem 3D\" has since been discontinued. An official fifth episode was released on October 11, 2016 with \"20th Anniversary World Tour\" published by Gearbox Software. After fifteen years in development hell, a direct sequel was released in 2011 called \"Duke Nukem Forever\".\n\nAs a first-person shooter whose gameplay is similar to \"Doom\", the gameplay of \"Duke Nukem 3D\" involves moving through levels presented from the protagonist's point of view, shooting enemies on the way. The environments in \"Duke Nukem 3D\" are highly destructible and interactive; most props can be destroyed by the player.\n\nLevels were designed in a fairly non-linear manner such that players can advantageously use air ducts, back doors, and sewers to avoid enemies or find hidden caches. These locations are also filled with objects with which the player can interact, that either benefit the player in some form, light switches make it easier to see, while water fountains and broken hydrants provide some health points or simply diversion, and tipping strippers provokes a quote from Duke, and a provocative reveal from the dancer.\n\nDuke's arsenal consists of the \"Mighty Foot\" (a basic kick attack), a pistol, a shotgun, a triple-barrelled chain gun, a rocket-propelled grenade launcher, pipe bombs, freeze and shrink rays, laser land mines, and the rapid fire \"Devastator\" rocket launcher. There is also an extra weapon known as the \"Expander\", the opposite of the shrink ray weapon, which is only available in the \"Atomic Edition\" version of the game.\n\nVarious items can be picked up during gameplay. The portable medkit allows players to heal Duke at will. Steroids speed up Duke's movement, as well as instantly reversing the effects of the shrink ray weapon and increasing the strength of Duke's Mighty Foot for a short period. Night vision goggles allow players to see enemies in the dark. The \"HoloDuke\" device projects a hologram of Duke which can be used to distract enemies. Protective boots allow Duke to cross dangerously hot or toxic terrain. In sections where progress requires more aquatic legwork, an aqua-lung allows Duke to take longer trips underwater. Duke's jet pack allows the player to move vertically and gain access to otherwise inaccessible areas.\n\nThe game features a wide variety of enemies; some of which are aliens and other mutated humans. The LAPD have been turned into \"Pig Cops\", a play on the derogatory term \"pig\" for police officers, with LARD emblazoned on their uniforms. As is usual for a first-person shooter, Duke Nukem encounters a large number of lesser foes, as well as bosses, usually at the end of episodes. Like Duke, these enemies have access to a wide range of weapons and equipment, and some weaker enemies have jet packs.\n\n\"Duke Nukem 3D\" features multiplayer. At the time of its release, Internet-based gaming was just beginning. \"Duke Nukem 3D\" did not support the TCP/IP client/server model, instead based its network play on the IPX LAN, modem or serial cable. \"Duke Nukem 3D\" players often either battled modem-to-modem, using the IPX network utility Kali or the Total Entertainment Network (TEN) online pay service. Kali allowed users to connect to a chat room to host and join games. \"Duke Nukem 3D\" was one of the more popular games on TEN prior to the closure of the network in 1999. The game was also supported by DWANGO.\n\n\"Duke Nukem 3D\" levels were often used as the battlegrounds for these encounters, and users were even able to create their own levels, or maps, using the level editor bundled with the game, which was also used by the developers to design the initial levels. The game also features co-operative play, co-op, which allows players to complete the story based single player mode together. In \"Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition\", a new game play mode was introduced: Duke-Tag, a \"capture the flag\" style mode.\n\n\"Duke Nukem 3D\" has been ported to run on modern Microsoft Windows variants including Windows XP, Windows 7, and Windows 8. This has been made possible since the game's source code was publicly released in 2003. Various source ports have been made including \"EDuke32\", \"JFDuke3D\", \"nDuke\", \"hDuke\", and \"xDuke\". All five offer the original visual appearance of the game, while \"EDuke32\" also supports OpenGL rendering including the capability to use fan-created modern graphics using the High Resolution Pack. \"nDuke\", \"hDuke\" and \"xDuke\" can still be played online in multiplayer 'DukeMatch' format using launchers such as Duke Matcher and YANG, both freely available. \"EDuke32\" multiplayer is in a state of development hell following an attempt to rewrite the network functionality using a client–server model.\n\n\"Duke Nukem 3D\" is set on Earth \"sometime in the early 21st century\". The levels of \"Duke Nukem 3D\" take players outdoors and indoors through rendered street scenes, military bases, deserts, a flooded city, space stations, moon bases, and a Japanese restaurant.\n\nThe game contains several humorous references to pop culture. Some of Duke's lines are drawn from movies such as \"Aliens\", \"Dirty Harry\", \"Evil Dead II\", \"Full Metal Jacket\", \"Jaws\", \"Pulp Fiction\", and \"They Live\"; the captured women saying \"Kill me\" is a reference to \"Aliens\". Players will encounter corpses of famous characters such as Luke Skywalker, Indiana Jones, Snake Plissken, the protagonist of \"Doom\", and a smashed T-800. In the first episode, players navigate a tunnel in the wall of a prison cell hidden behind a poster, just like in \"The Shawshank Redemption\". During the second episode, players can see The Monolith (from \"\") on the moon. In the bathroom of the first level, 867-5309 is written on a wall.\n\nThe game cover itself is a parody of \"Army of Darkness\", with Duke posing as Ash Williams.\n\nThere is little narrative in the game, only a brief text prelude located under \"Help\" in the Main Menu, and a few cutscenes after the completion of an episode. The game picks up right after the events of \"Duke Nukem II\", with Duke returning to Earth in his space cruiser. As Duke descends on Los Angeles in hopes of taking a vacation, his ship is shot down by unknown hostiles. While sending a distress signal, Duke learns that aliens are attacking Los Angeles and have mutated the LAPD. With his vacation plans now ruined, Duke hits the \"eject\" button, and vows to do whatever it takes to stop the alien invasion.\n\nIn \"Episode One: \"L.A. Meltdown\"\", Duke fights his way through a dystopian Los Angeles. At a strip club, he is captured by pig-cops, but escapes the alien-controlled penitentiary and tracks down the alien cruiser responsible for the invasion in the San Andreas Fault. Duke discovers that the aliens were capturing women, and detonates the ship. Levels in this episode include a movie theater, a Red Light District, a prison, and a nuclear-waste disposal facility.\n\nIn \"Episode Two: \"Lunar Apocalypse\"\", Duke journeys to space, where he finds many of the captured women held in various incubators throughout space stations that had been conquered by the aliens. Duke reaches the alien mothership on the Moon and kills an alien Overlord. As Duke inspects the ship's computer, it is revealed that the plot to capture women was merely a ruse to distract him. The aliens have already begun their attack on Earth.\n\nIn \"Episode Three: \"Shrapnel City\"\", Duke battles the massive alien resistance through Los Angeles once again, and kills the leader of alien menace: the Cycloid Emperor. The game ends as Duke promises that after some \"R&R\", he will be \"...ready for more action!\", as an anonymous woman calls him back to bed. Levels in this episode include a sushi bar, a movie set, a subway, and a hotel.\n\nThe story continues in the \"Atomic Edition\". In \"Episode Four: \"The Birth\"\", it is revealed that the aliens used a captured woman to give birth to the Alien Queen, a creature which can quickly spawn deadly alien protector drones. Duke is dispatched back to Los Angeles to fight hordes of aliens, including the protector drones. Eventually, Duke finds the lair of the Alien Queen, and kills her, thus thwarting the alien plot. Levels in this episode include a fast-food restaurant (\"Duke Burger\"), a supermarket, a Disneyland parody called \"Babe Land,\" a police station, the Exxon Valdez, and Area 51.\n\nWith the release of \"20th Anniversary World Tour\", the story progress further. In \"Episode Five: \"Alien World Order\"\", Duke finds out that the aliens initiated a world-scale invasion, so he sets out to repel their attack on various countries. Duke proceeds to clear out aliens from Amsterdam (Netherlands), Moscow (Russia), London (England), San Francisco (USA), Paris (France), Giza Pyramid (Egypt), Rome (Italy), with the final showdown with the returning alien threat taking place in Los Angeles, taking the game full circle. There, he defeats the Cycloid Incinerator, the current alien leader, stopping their threat for good.\n\n\"Duke Nukem 3D\" was developed on a budget of roughly $300,000. The development team consisted of eight people for most of the development cycle, increasing to 12 or 13 people near the end. At one point the game was being programmed to allow the player to switch between first person view, third person view, and fixed camera angles. Scott Miller of 3D Realms recalled that \"with \"Duke 3D\", unlike every shooter that came before, we wanted to have sort of real life locations like a cinema theatre, you know, strip club, bookstores...\"\n\n\"LameDuke\" is a beta version of \"Duke Nukem 3D\", which was released by 3D Realms as a \"bonus\" one year after the release of the official version. It has been released as is, with no support. \"LameDuke\" features four episodes: \"Mr. Caliber\", \"Mission Cockroach\", \"Suck Hole\", and \"Hard Landing\". Certain weapons were altered from the original versions and/or removed.\n\nLee Jackson's theme song \"Grabbag\" has elicited many spin-offs and remixes over the years by both fans and professional musicians, including an officially sanctioned studio version by the popular thrash metal outfit Megadeth. Another version of the song was recorded by Chris Kline in August 2005. 3D Realms featured it on the front page of their website and contracted with Kline to use it to promote their Xbox Live release of \"Duke Nukem 3D\".\n\nThe original official website was created by Jeffrey D. Erb and Mark Farish of Intersphere Communications Ltd.\n\n\n\n\"Duke Nukem 3D\" was ported to many consoles of the time. All of the ports featured some sort of new content.\n\n\n\"Duke Nukem 3D\" was a commercial hit, selling about 3.5 million copies. In the United States alone, it was the 12th best-selling computer game from 1993 to 1999, with 950,000 units sold.\n\nFollowing the release of the \"Doom\" source code in 1997, gamers wanted a similar source code release from 3D Realms. The last major game to make use of the \"Duke Nukem 3D\" source code was TNT Team's \"World War II GI\" in 1999. Its programmer, Matthew Saettler, obtained permission from 3D Realms to expand the gameplay enhancements done on \"WWII GI\" to \"Duke Nukem 3D\".\n\n\"EDuke\" was a semi-official branch of \"Duke Nukem 3D\" that was released as a patch as \"Duke Nukem 3D\" v2.0 for \"Atomic Edition\" users on July 28, 2000. It included a demo mod made by several beta testers. It focused primarily on enhancing the CON scripting language in ways which allowed those modifying the game to do much more with the system than originally possible. Though a further version was planned, it never made it out of beta. It was eventually cancelled due to programmer time constraints. About a month after the release of the \"Duke Nukem 3D\" source code, \"Blood\" project manager Matt Saettler released the source code for both \"EDuke\" v2.0 and EDuke v2.1, the test version of which would have eventually become the next \"EDuke\" release, under the GPL.\n\nThe source code to the \"Duke Nukem 3D\" v1.5 executable, which uses the Build engine, was released as free software under the GPL on April 1, 2003. The game content remains under a proprietary license. The game was quickly ported by enthusiasts to modern operating systems.\n\nThe first \"Duke Nukem 3D\" port was from icculus.org. It is a cross-platform project that allows the game to be played on AmigaOS, AmigaOS 4, AROS, BeOS, FreeBSD, Linux, Mac OS X, MorphOS, Solaris, and Windows rather than MS-DOS. The icculus.org codebase would later be used as the base for several other ports, including \"Duke3d_32\".\n\nAnother popular early project was Jonathon Fowler's \"JFDuke3D\", which, in December 2003, received backing from the original author of Build, programmer Ken Silverman. Fowler, in cooperation with Silverman, released a new version of \"JFDuke3D\" using Polymost, an OpenGL-enhanced renderer for Build which allows hardware acceleration and 3D model support along with 32-bit color high resolution textures. Another project based on \"JFDuke3D\" called \"xDuke\", unrelated to the \"xDuke\" project based on \"Duke3d_w32\", runs on the Xbox. Silverman has since helped Fowler with a large portion of other engine work, including updating the network code, and helping to maintain various other aspects of the engine. Development appears to have stopped; as of January 2015, there have been no new versions since October 9, 2005.\n\nWhile a few short-lived DOS-based \"EDuke\" projects emerged, it was not until the release of \"EDuke32\", an extended version of \"Duke3D\" incorporating variants of both Fowler's Microsoft Windows \"JFDuke3D\" code, and Saettler's \"EDuke code\", by one of 3D Realms' forum moderators in late 2004, that \"EDuke's\" scripting extensions received community focus. Among the various enhancements, support for advanced shader model 3.0 based graphics was added to \"EDuke32\" during late 2008-early 2009. In June 2008, thanks to significant porting contributions from the DOSBox team, \"EDuke32\" became the only \"Duke Nukem 3D\" source port to compile and run natively on 64-bit Linux systems without the use of a 32-bit compatibility environment.\n\nOn April 1, 2009, an OpenGL Shader Model 3.0 renderer was revealed to have been developed for \"EDuke32\", named \"Polymer\" to distinguish from Ken Silverman's \"Polymost\". It allows for much more modern effects such as dynamic lighting and normal mapping. Although Polymer is fully functional, it is technically incomplete and unoptimized, and is still in development. As of the fifth installment of the \"High Resolution Pack\", released in 2011, the Polymer renderer is mandatory. In 2011, another significant development of \"EDuke32\" was the introduction of true room over room (TROR), where sectors can be placed over other sectors, and can be seen at the same time. In practice, this allows for true three-dimensional level design that was previously impossible, although the base engine is still 2D.\n\nOn December 18, 2012, \"Chocolate Duke3D\" port was released. Inspired by \"Chocolate Doom\", the primary goal was to refactor the code so developers would easily read and learn from it.\n\nIn February 2013, a source code review article was published that described the internal working of the code.\n\nAll versions of the game have earned a positive aggregate score on GameRankings and Metacritic. The original release on MS-DOS holds an aggregate score of 88.50% on GameRankings and a score of 89/100 on Metacritic. The version released on Sega Saturn holds an aggregate score of 82.50% on GameRankings. The version released on Xbox 360 holds an aggregate score of 80.67% on GameRankings while it holds a score of 80/100 on Metacritic. The iOS version holds an aggregate score of 63.80% on GameRankings.\n\nDaniel Jevons of \"Maximum\" gave it five out of five stars, calling it \"absolutely perfect in every respect.\" He particularly cited the game's speed and fluidity even on low-end PCs, imaginative weapons, varied and identifiable environments, true 3D level designs, and strong multiplayer mode. A \"Next Generation\" critic summarized that \"\"Duke Nukem 3D\" has everything \"Doom\" doesn't, but it also doesn't leave out the stuff that made \"Doom\" a classic.\" He praised the imaginative weapons, long and complex single-player campaign, competitive multiplayer, built-in level editor, and parental lock. Reviewers paid a lot of attention to the sexual content within the game. Reception of this element varied: Tim Soete of GameSpot felt that it was \"morally questionable\", while the Game Revolution reviewer noted that it was \"done in a tongue-in-cheek manner,\" and he was \"not personally offended\". GamingOnLinux reviewer Hamish Paul Wilson commented in a later retrospective how the game's \"dark dystopian atmosphere filled with pornography and consumerist decadence\" in his view helped to ground \"the game's more outlandish and obscene moments in context\", concluding that \"in a world as perverse as this, someone like Duke becoming its hero seems almost inevitable.\"\n\n\"Duke Nukem 3D\" was a finalist for CNET Gamecenter's 1996 \"Best Action Game\" award, which ultimately went to \"Quake\". In 1996, \"Next Generation\" ranked it as the 35th top game of all time, called \"for many, the game \"Quake\" should have been.\" In 1996 \"Computer Gaming World\" named \"Duke Nukem 3D\" #37 overall among the best games of all time and #13 among the \"best ways to die in computer gaming\". \"PC Gamer\" magazine's readers' voted it #13 on its all-time top games poll. The editors of \"PC Game\" ranked it as the 12th top game of all time in 2001 citing the game's humor and pop-culture references, and as the 15th best games of all time in 2005. \"GamePro\" included it among the most important video games of all time. In 2009, IGN's Cam Shea ranked it as the ninth top 10 Xbox Live Arcade game, stating that it was as fun as it was in its initial release, and praised the ability to rewind to any point before the player died.\n\nJapanese gaming magazine \"Famitsu\" reviewed the PlayStation console port, giving it a 21 out of 40 score.\n\n\"Duke Nukem 3D\" was attacked by some critics, who alleged that it promoted pornography and murder. Jamia Wilson, then vice president of Women's Media Center, criticized the depictions of women for being \"extremely harmful, especially to young women\". In response to the criticism encountered, censored versions of the game were released in certain countries in order to avoid it being banned altogether. A similar censored version was carried at Wal-Mart retail stores in the United States.\n\nIn Australia, the game was originally refused classification on release. 3D Realms repackaged the game with the parental lock feature permanently enabled, although a patch available on the 3D Realms website allowed the user to revert the game back into its uncensored U.S. version. The OFLC then attempted to have the game pulled from the shelves, but it was discovered that the distributor had notified them of this fact and the rating could not be surrendered; six months later, the game was reclassified and released uncensored with an MA15+ rating. In Germany, the BPjM placed the game on their \"List B\" (\"List of Media Harmful to Young People\") of videos games, thus prohibiting its advertisement in the public. However, it was not fully confiscated, meaning that an adult could still request to see the game and buy it. In 1999, \"Duke Nukem 3D\" was banned in Brazil, along with \"Doom\" and several other first-person shooters after a rampage, in and around a movie theater, was supposedly inspired by the first level in the game.\n\nDespite such concerns from critics, legislators, and publishers, Scott Miller later recounted that 3D Realms saw very little negative feedback to the game's controversial elements from actual gamers or their parents. He pointed out that \"Duke Nukem 3D\" was appropriately rated \"M\" and had no real nudity, and speculated that that was enough to make it inoffensive to the general public.\n"}

Another 6.7 million people reported their ethnicity as simply \"Canadian\" without further specification, which would include those with an admixture of multiple ethnicities, particularly those long present in Canada (e.g. French, Irish, English, and Scottish), making it possible that the number is much higher than the nearly 6 million who reported as having English origins. On the other hand, historically, there have also been numerous Canadians who have hidden their true ancestry for different political reasons to join the dominant English group, such as to avoid discrimination, as seems to have been the case of the reported German-origin population, which dropped by nearly half after the First World War with a commensurate rise in reports of English origins.\n\n"}
{"id": "453045", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=453045", "title": "Fantasy Island", "text": "Fantasy Island\n\nFantasy Island was an American television series that originally aired on the ABC network from 1977 to 1984. It starred Ricardo Montalbán as the mysterious Mr. Roarke, who grants the fantasies of visitors to the island for a price. The series was created by Gene Levitt. A revival of the series aired on the same network 14 years later during the 1998–1999 season.\n\nBefore it became a television series, \"Fantasy Island\" was introduced to viewers in 1977 and 1978 through two made-for-television films. Airing from 1978 to 1984, the original series starred Ricardo Montalbán as Mr. Roarke, the enigmatic overseer of a mysterious island somewhere in the Pacific Ocean, where people from all walks of life could come and live out their fantasies, albeit for a price.\n\nRoarke was known for his white suit and cultured demeanor, and was initially accompanied by an energetic sidekick, Tattoo (played by Hervé Villechaize). Tattoo would run up the main bell tower to ring the bell and shout \"Ze plane! Ze plane!\" to announce the arrival of a new set of guests at the beginning of each episode. This line, shown at the beginning of the series' credits, became an unlikely catchphrase because of Villechaize's spirited delivery and French accent. In later seasons, he would arrive in his personal go-kart, sized for him, and recklessly drive to join Roarke for the visitor reception while the staff scrambled to get out of his way. From 1981 to 1982, Wendy Schaal joined the cast as a beautiful brown-eyed blonde assistant named Julie. The producers dismissed Villechaize from the series before the 1983–1984 season, which ended up being its last, and Tattoo was replaced by a more sedate butler type named Lawrence (played by Christopher Hewett), who pressed an electronic button to ring the bell rather than climb the tower himself. \n\nA Grumman Widgeon aircraft was used for the series. Just prior to the guests disembarking from the plane, Mr. Roarke would address his assembling employees with the phrase \"Smiles, everyone! Smiles!\". As each visitor exited the plane, Roarke would describe to Tattoo (or another assistant) the nature of their fantasy, usually with a cryptic comment suggesting the person's fantasy will not turn out as they expected. Roarke would then welcome his guests by lifting his glass and saying: \"My dear guests, I am Mr. Roarke, your host. Welcome to Fantasy Island.\" This toast was usually followed with a warm smile but sometimes (depending on the nature of a guest or their fantasy) his eyes would show concern or worry for a guest's safety.\n\nVery little is known about the man known only as Mr. Roarke. Many people close to him, including past lovers, have referred to him only as \"Roarke\". He is the sole owner and proprietor of Fantasy Island. Roarke's actual age is a complete mystery. In the pilot film, he comments how the guests who come to his island are \"so mortal\" and there are hints throughout the series that suggest Roarke may be immortal. In \"Elizabeth\", a woman from Roarke's past appears, but it is revealed that she died over 300 years ago. Other episodes suggests that he was friends with Helen of Troy and Cleopatra. However old he is, Roarke has come to know many seemingly-immortal beings over his time on Earth, including ghosts (\"The Ghost's Story\"), a genie (\"A Genie Named Joe\"), the mermaid Princess Nyah (\"The Mermaid\", \"The Mermaid Returns\", \"The Mermaid and the Matchmaker\"), the goddess Aphrodite (\"Aphrodite\"), and Uriel the Angel of Death (\"The Angel's Triangle\"). In \"The Devil and Mandy Breem\" and \"The Devil and Mr. Roarke\", Roarke even faces the Devil (played by Roddy McDowall) who has come to the island to challenge him for either a guest's immortal soul or his. It is mentioned this is not the first time they have confronted each other and Mr. Roarke has always been the winner. In the second story, the Devil was one of the island's guests, claiming he was only there to relax and had no interest in Roarke's soul at the time. However, this turned out to be yet another ruse.\n\nRoarke had a strong moral code, but he was always merciful. He usually tried to teach his guests important life lessons through the medium of their fantasies, frequently in a manner that exposes the errors of their ways, and on occasions when the island hosted terminally ill guests he would allow them to live out one last wish. Roarke's fantasies were not without peril, but the greatest danger usually came from the guests themselves. In some cases, people were killed due to their own negligence, aggression or arrogance. When necessary, Roarke would directly intervene when the fantasy became dangerous to the guest:\n\n\nWith only a few exceptions, Roarke always made it quite clear that he was powerless to stop a fantasy once it had begun and that guests must play them out to their conclusion.\n\nIn later seasons, there were often supernatural overtones. Roarke also seemed to have his own supernatural powers of some sort (called the \"Gift of the McNabs\" in \"Delphine\"), although it was never explained how this came to be. In the episodes \"Reprisal\" and \"The Power\" he temporarily gave the guest psychokinetic abilities and in \"Terrors of the Mind\" the power to see into the future. In one episode, when a guest says \"Thank God things worked out well\", Roarke and Tattoo share an odd look and Roarke says in a cryptic way \"Thank God, indeed.\" In the same episode, Roarke uses some mysterious powers to help Tattoo with his magic act. Ricardo Montalban would claim in interviews that he had a definite opinion in mind regarding the mystery of Mr. Roarke, and how he accomplished his fantasies, but he would never publicly state what it was. Years after the series was off the air, in an interview with the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, Montalban finally revealed that his motivation was imagining Roarke as a fallen angel whose sin was pride and that Fantasy Island was purgatory.\n\nEach episode would alternate between two or three independent storylines as the guests experienced their fantasies and interacted with Roarke. When reruns of the series went into syndication, a half-hour version was offered, in which each hour-long original show was split to two separate half-hour shows in which only one guest's story was told in each half-hour episode. This made it obvious that the original episodes had been planned in such a way that each guest or family got off the plane separately, did not interact with the other guest or family, and was given almost exactly half the time of the original episode.\n\nOften the fantasies would turn out to be morality lessons for the guests. For example, one featured a couple who clamored for the \"good old days\" being taken back to the Salem witch trials, sometimes to the point of (apparently) putting their lives at risk, only to have Roarke step in at the last minute and reveal the deception. It is mentioned a few times that a condition of visiting Fantasy Island is that guests never reveal what goes on there. A small number of guests decided to make the irrevocable choice to stay permanently, living out their fantasy until death; one such person was an actor who had been in a Tarzan-type television series called \"Jungle Man\" in the 1960s. Aside from a clip show (\"Remember...When?\") the only episode with a single storyline was \"The Wedding\", in which terminally ill Helena Marsh (Samantha Eggar) returned to Fantasy Island to spend her last days as Roarke's wife.\n\nIn the first film, it was noted that each guest had paid $50,000 (about $ in dollars) in advance for the fulfillment of their fantasies and that Fantasy Island was a business. In \"Return to Fantasy Island\", Roarke told Tattoo that he sometimes dropped the price when a guest couldn't afford the usual fee because he believed everyone should be given a chance to have their fantasies fulfilled. Afterwards, it became clear that the price a guest paid was substantial to him or her, and for one little girl whose father was one of Roarke's guests, she had emptied her piggy bank (which contained less than ten dollars) to have her fantasy with her father fulfilled. On numerous occasions, a guest had not paid for the trip at all but instead won it as a result of a contest. Those who came by winning contests were usually the unknowing beneficiaries of rigged contests in order to disguise to themselves and others the real reason for their coming as part of someone else's fantasy.\n\nThe nature of a fantasy varied from story to story and were typically very personal to each guest on some level. They could be as harmless as wanting to be reunited with a lost love to something more dangerous like tracking down a cold-blooded killer who murdered someone close to the guest. Usually, the fantasy would take an unexpected turn and proceed down a quite different path than the guest expected. Some resolve in \"The Monkey's Paw\" style. He or she would then leave with some new revelation or renewed interest about themselves or someone close to them. Many times, Roarke would reveal in the end that someone they met during the course of their fantasy was another guest living a fantasy of their own. Both guests often left the island together. However, in one episode, one guest had no particular fantasy and was simply there to relax and enjoy himself. In another episode, one guest's (Don Knotts) fantasy was to play the part of a private eye. At the end of the episode, he discovers that his 'suspects' were actually a company of actors who had asked Mr. Roarke to act out their 'whodunnit' play in a realistic setting.\n\nAlthough some fantasies were rooted in the real world, many others involved supernatural (such as ghosts, demons, or witchcraft) or mythological (mermaids, genies, Greek goddesses) elements. Time-travel was often a required element, if not a specific request, to fulfill one's fantasy.\n\nRoarke often preceded particularly risky fantasies with a stern warning, word of caution, or even suggestion that the guest select another fantasy instead. He would then inform his guests that he was powerless to stop a fantasy once it had begun and must allow the fantasy to play out until its ultimate conclusion. Despite this, on rare occasions, Roarke will appear halfway through a fantasy to offer a guest an opportunity to terminate their fantasy, warning the guest that continuing the fantasy may lead to serious consequences (possibly even death). However, at that point, the guest will decide on their own to see the fantasy to its end, either for selfless reasons (regarding someone they had met during the fantasy) or naivety of what is in store for them. In the most serious cases, however, Roarke would invariably intervene and ensure his guests' safety.\n\nAaron Spelling admitted the original pitch was a joke. Spelling and production partner Leonard Goldberg were pitching ideas to ABC executive Brandon Stoddard. After the executive rejected all of their plans, at least six in all, Spelling blurted out: \"What do you want? An island that people can go to and all of their sexual fantasies will be realized?\" Stoddard loved the idea.\n\nThe network wanted Orson Welles for Mr. Roarke, but Spelling rejected him, knowing of his irritable nature on sets. He also rejected the idea of a sexy female sidekick to join Roarke and Tattoo.\n\nThe show was broadcast every Saturday night on ABC at 10:00, after \"The Love Boat\", which was also produced by Aaron Spelling. Like several other series of the era, such as \"The Love Boat\" and \"Murder, She Wrote\", \"Fantasy Island\" employed many celebrity guest stars, often bringing them back repeatedly for different roles.\n\nThe series was filmed primarily in Burbank, California, with the opening scenes of the enchanting island coastline being that of Kauai, Hawaii (both the Na Pali coast as well as Wailua Falls). The house with the bell tower, where Tattoo rings the bell, is the Queen Anne Cottage, located in the Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden in Arcadia. The plane, \"arriving\" with the guests, was filmed in the lagoon behind the Queen Anne Cottage. Sometimes, outdoor scenes were filmed at the Arboretum.\n\nInterior sets were filmed on Stages 26 and 17 at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California. At some point, the production of exterior scenes moved to the Warner Ranch a short distance away from Warner's main lot.\n\nThe Fantasy Island theme music was composed by Laurence Rosenthal.\n\nIn 1998, ABC revived the series in a Saturday time slot. The role of Mr. Roarke was played by Malcolm McDowell in the revival, and in contrast to the first series the supernatural aspect of his character and of Fantasy Island itself was emphasized from the start, along with a dose of dark humor. Director Barry Sonnenfeld, known for his work on \"The Addams Family\" movies, was a chief creative force on the new series. Another difference was that the new series was filmed in Hawaii instead of California. The remake followed the fantasies of at least two of Roarke's guests with an additional subplot involving members of his staff – usually Cal and Harry. Whereas the original series featured a separate writer and title for each subplot, the new series was written as several stories but featuring a unified theme and title.\n\nOn July 31, 2018, it was announced that a film adaptation of the television series is in the works. Sony Pictures will release the film and be produced by Blumhouse Productions. \"Truth or Dare\" director and co-screenwriter Jeff Wadlow will direct the remake from a script by Wadlow, Chris Roach, and Jillian Jacobs. On December 1, the film is set to released on February 28, 2020.\n\nSelected episodes from the first, second and third seasons are available free at Hulu. Selected Minisodes from seasons one, three, four, five, and six are available free at Crackle, along with complete episodes from seasons one, two, and three.\n\nDigital multicast television network Cozi TV announced the series would be airing on the network beginning fall 2013. Episodes of the original series were seen on Fridays on sister cable network Universal HD, until July 2017, when the network changed to the Olympic Channel.\n\nIn Canada, episodes of the original series aired during primetime some evenings and again on the weekend on TV Land (now Comedy Gold).\n\nIn Greece, episodes are aired very early in the morning (sometimes 04.00-04.30) every day on Mega Channel.\n\nIn 1988, Star Classics released the pilot episode of the series on VHS in the United States and Canada.\n\nIn 2005, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released Season 1 of the original series on DVD in regions 1, 2 & 4. The release included the 1977 pilot \"Fantasy Island\" and 1978's \"Return to Fantasy Island\". However, due to poor sales, no further seasons were released.\n\nIn February 2012, it was announced that Shout! Factory had acquired the rights to the series in Region 1; they subsequently released the second season on DVD on May 8, 2012. Season 3 was released on October 23, 2012.\n\nMill Creek Entertainment announced Fantasy Island on DVD.\n\n"}

It consists of the Coat of Arms on a blue field with red stripes at the top and bottom.\n\nBritish Honduras obtained a coat of arms on 28 January 1907, which formed the basis of the badge used on British ensigns. The coat of arms recalls the logging industry that first led to British settlement there. The figures, tools, and mahogany tree represent this industry. The national motto, \"Sub Umbra Floreo\", meaning \"Under the Shade I Flourish\", is written in the lower part of the coat of arms.\n\nThe flag is royal blue, with a white disc at the centre containing the national coat of arms held by a mestizo and a man of African descent. The flag of Belize is the only country to have humans depicted as a major design element on its national flag, although the flag of Malta contains an image of Saint George on the badge of the George Cross, and the flags of British overseas territories Montserrat and the Virgin Islands, and that of French Polynesia also depict humans. The flag is bordered at top and bottom by two red stripes.\n\nThe colours on the flag are respectively those of the country's national parties, the People's United Party (PUP) and United Democratic Party (Belize) (UDP). The UDP, established in 1973, had objected to the original blue and white design, those two colours being the PUP's representative colours.\n\nThe two red stripes at the top and bottom were added to the original design at independence. The coat of arms was granted in 1907. Red stripes were added to denote the colour of the opposition party. The 50 leaves recall 1950, the year PUP came to power.\n\nFrom 1950 onward, an unofficial national flag was in use. It was blue, with the coat of arms on a white disc in the centre (sometimes a blank white circle was used as the coat of arms was difficult to draw). \n\nIn 1981, Belize gained its independence and a competition was held to design a national flag for the country. The winning submission consisted of the unofficial national flag used by the People's United Party with a red border added to all four sides. This was changed to a red border on just the top and bottom before the design was officially adopted.\n"}
{"id": "26019103", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26019103", "title": "Galfenol", "text": "Galfenol\n\nIn materials science, galfenol is the general term for an alloy of iron and gallium. The name was first given to iron-gallium alloys by United States Navy researchers in 1998 when they discovered that adding gallium to iron could amplify iron's magnetostrictive effect up to tenfold. Galfenol is of interest to sonar researchers because magnetostrictor materials are used to detect sound, and amplifying the magnetostrictive effect could lead to better sensitivity of sonar detectors. Galfenol is also proposed for vibrational energy harvesting, actuators for precision machine tools, active anti-vibration systems, and anti-clogging devices for sifting screens and spray nozzles. Galfenol is machinable and can be produced in sheet and wire form.\n\nIn 2009, scientists from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) used neutron beams to determine the structure of galfenol. They determined that the addition of gallium changes the lattice structure of the iron atoms from regular cubic cells to one in which the faces of some of the cells become slightly rectangular.

The film stars Gerard Butler as a participant in an online game in which participants can control human beings as players, and Logan Lerman as the player who controls him. Alongside Butler and Lerman, it also stars Michael C. Hall, Ludacris, Amber Valletta, Terry Crews, Alison Lohman, John Leguizamo, and Zoë Bell.\n\n\"Gamer\" was released in North America on September 4, 2009, receiving generally negative reviews from critics, who found the plot, direction, and script disappointing, though its performances, effects, and action sequences were praised. It received a mixed reception from audiences, and was a box office bomb, grossing $43 million worldwide against a production budget of $50 million.\n\nIn 2034, computer programmer Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall) invents self-replicating nanites that replace brain tissue and allow humans to control other humans' actions and see through their eyes. The first application of Castle's \"Nanex\" technology is a virtual community life simulation game, \"Society\", which allows gamers to manipulate live actors as their avatars. \"Society\" becomes a worldwide sensation, making Castle the richest man in the world. He then creates \"Slayers\", a first-person shooter where the \"characters\" are death-row prisoners using real weapons in specially created arenas. Unlike \"Society\" actors, \"Slayers\" participants are not paid; instead, they volunteer in exchange for the promise that any Slayer who survives 30 matches will earn his freedom (though no one ever has). \n\nJohn \"Kable\" Tillman (Butler) is the crowd's favorite, having survived a record 27 matches. He is exclusively controlled by Simon (Lerman), a seventeen-year-old superstar gamer from a wealthy family. \n\nAn activist organization called the \"Humanz\" hacks a talk-show interview with Castle and claims that his technology will one day be used to control people against their will. The Humanz also disrupt \"Society\" play, but Castle sees both these actions as trivial. However, Castle feels threatened by Kable's winning streak, and introduces a new inmate into \"Slayers\", Hackman (Crews), specifically to kill Kable. Unknown to anyone else, Hackman will not be controlled by a player, and thus not be handicapped by the \"ping\" that causes a small but dangerous delay between the player's command and the Slayer's action. \n\nKable/Tillman's wife, Angie (Valletta), works as a \"Society\" character, but in spite of her earnings, she is refused custody of their daughter Delia, who has been placed with a wealthy family. \n\nThe Humanz contact Kable and Simon separately, warning them that Castle has no intention of letting Kable survive, and offer to create a mod that will let him escape, but only if Simon relinquishes control during the game. The escape is successful, and news outlets report that Kable has been fragged, which puts Simon in a difficult position: he is labelled a \"cheater\", locked out of his bank account, and investigated by the FBI for helping Kable escape.\n\nTillman is brought to the Humanz' hideout; he refuses to help their fight against Castle, but learns of Angie's current location in \"Society\". He rescues her, escaping from both Hackman and Castle's security forces. They are met by Gina (Sedgwick), the talk show host, secretly assisting the Humanz. The Humanz deactivate the nanites in Angie and Tillman's brains, and Tillman remembers that the original nanites were tested on him while he was still in the military. Under Castle's control, Tillman shot and killed his best friend, and was imprisoned.\n\nUpon learning that Castle is the wealthy father who adopted Delia, Tillman infiltrates his mansion to get her back. He locates Castle, who reveals that his henchmen have already tracked down the Humanz' lair and killed all of them. He also reveals that 98% of his own brain has been replaced with nanites, but his allow him to control others, rather than be controlled. He plans to release air-borne nanites which will infect the entire United States within six months, giving him ultimate control. Hackman attacks Tillman, who easily kills him. Tillman then attacks Castle, but is frozen in place, as Castle explains that his men have reactivated his and Angie's nanites.\n\nUnknown to Castle, Gina and Trace (Lohman) escaped the murder of the Humanz, and patch into the Nanex, revealing the confrontation to the world and exposing Castle's plans. It also unblocks Simon's account and restores his control of Tillman.\n\nCastle tries to manipulate Tillman into killing his own daughter, but he resists, and then Simon's control allows him to attack Castle. He and Simon wrestle for control over Tillman, but Tillman tells Castle to imagine Tillman's knife stabbing him. Castle unconsciously does so, allowing Tillman to kill him and removing his control over everyone. With Castle dead, Tillman convinces his technicians to deactivate the Nanex, freeing all the \"characters\" in \"Society\" and \"Slayers\".\n\nThe film closes with the Tillman family taking a trip down a country road, ending with the words \"Game Over\".\n\nIn May 2007, Lakeshore Entertainment re-teamed with Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, the creators of \"Crank\" (2006), to produce a \"high-concept futuristic thriller\" called \"Game\". Neveldine and Taylor wrote the script for \"Game\" and were slated to direct the film, while actor Gerard Butler was cast into the lead role.\n\nPrincipal photography took place in Albuquerque, New Mexico for a 53-day shoot. Filming was at the Albuquerque Studios and on location around Albuquerque. Multistory sets were built on parking lots in downtown Albuquerque to depict buildings that were blown up in the film, and other sets were built on the back lots near the studios. The crew used special hand-held Red One digital cameras, which allowed the special effects team to begin work normally done in post-production after each day's shooting.\n\nIn March 2009, the film's working title was changed from \"Game\" to \"Citizen Game\". In May 2009, another name change was announced, the new name being \"Gamer\".\n\n\"Gamer\" had an opening day gross of $3.3 million and ranked fourth at the box office. In total, the film earned $9.2 million in its opening weekend. Overall, the film grossed $21.5 in the United States and Canadian and $20.7 million in other territories for worldwide cumulative of $42 million, against its $50 million budget.\n\nThe film received negative reviews from critics. The film holds a 28% \"Rotten\" rating from 75 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes; the site's consensus being \"with all of the hyperkinetic action and none of the flair of Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor's earlier work, \"Gamer\" has little replay value.\"\n\nCritic Joe Neumaier of The \"New York Daily News\", agreed, calling it a \"Xerox of a Xerox\" and citing a number of films it supposedly takes elements from, including \"The Matrix\" and \"Rollerball\". \"RVA Magazine\" noted that \"Gamer\"s plot was overly similar to \"The Condemned\" and commented that \"Gamer\" \"hates its primary audience\" and \"tries to criticize the commercialization of violence, even though it itself is commercialized violence\".\n\nCultural critic Steven Shaviro authored a 10,000 word defense and analysis of the film that he posted online, and eventually re-worked into the penultimate chapter of his book, \"Post-Cinematic Affect\" (Zer0 Books, 2010).\n\n"}
{"id": "167316", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=167316", "title": "Graduation", "text": "Graduation\n\nGraduation is getting a diploma or academic degree or the ceremony that is sometimes associated with it, in which students become graduates. Before the graduation, candidates are referred to as graduands. The date of graduation is often called graduation day. The graduation ceremony itself is also called commencement, convocation or invocation. Normally, the ceremony and name apply to high school and above (the next ascending levels being Associate's, Bachelor's, Master's, and Doctorate). In the United States of America, graduations for elementary school or even Kindergarten have been a development of recent years. When ceremonies are associated, they usually include a procession of the academic staff and candidates and a valediction. At the college and university level the faculty will usually wear academic dress at the formal ceremonies, as will the trustees and degree candidates.\n\n\"Graduation\" at the college and university level occurs when the presiding officer confers degrees upon candidates, either individually or en masse, even if graduates physically receive their diploma later at a smaller college or departmental ceremony. After degree completion, graduates can be referred to by their graduating year.\n\nIn some places, graduation parties to celebrate graduation from school, college or university are popular. In a recent 2014 nationwide survey in the United States, $985 was the average amount spent on graduation parties. When a student graduates without attending the ceremony, then it is called graduation \"in absentia\".\n\nThe procedures and traditions surrounding academic graduation ceremonies differ around the world. Whereas in the United Kingdom a graduation usually only occurs at university level, in the United States of America and many other countries graduations also occur at high schools where no higher education qualifications are conferred upon the graduates. In a graduation ceremony the students dress up in special graduation caps and clothing that are made just for this purpose.\n\nGraduation traditions are varied across universities observing different cultures. Most universities across Sweden are research-oriented and may present its students with bachelor's, master's, and doctor's degrees covering all academic streams. Universities across the country are based through the Higher Education Ordinance. A large number of candidates continue their education onto secondary and upper secondary education. Most of the national programs provide Swedish, English, Math and Science among majors.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, graduation ceremonies are often associated with the guest of honor who most of is the ceremonial head of the institution. At state universities the President of Zimbabwe officiates as chancellor and guest of honor. Every graduate of a state university in Zimbabwe can claim to have shaken the President's hand. The person most associated with graduation at those institutions is Zimbabwe's ex-President Robert Gabriel Mugabe. At other State Institutions of higher learning the vice Presidents or any other Senior Government officials may preside.\n\nCeremonies for graduating students date from the first universities in Europe in the 12th century. At that time Latin was the language of scholarship. A \"universitas\" was a guild of masters (MAs) with licence to teach. \"Degree\" and \"graduate\" come from gradus, meaning \"step\". The first step was admission to a bachelor's degree. The second step was the masters step, giving the graduate admission to the universitas and license to teach. The typical dress for graduation are gowns and hoods or hats adapted from the daily dress of university staff in the Middle Ages, which was in turn based on the attire worn by medieval clergy.\n\nThe tradition of wearing graduation hats in Sweden has been in place since the mid 18th century. The cap is typically a white sailor hat with a black or dark blue band around it, a crown motif, and a black peak at the front. The graduation hat tradition was initially brought into practice by students at Uppsala University. The headgear then became popular across several other European nations as well.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1689729", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1689729", "title": "Hei matau", "text": "Hei matau\n\nA hei matau is a bone or greenstone carving in the shape of a highly stylised fish hook typical of the Māori people of New Zealand.\nThey represent strength, good luck and safe travel across water.\n\nThe fish-hook shape of the \"hei matau\" means to know, which holds that the North Island of New Zealand was once a huge fish that was caught by the great mariner Maui using only a woven line and a hook made from the jawbone of his grandmother. Legend holds that the shape of Hawke Bay is that of the hei matau, which caught in the fish's side on the beach. The Māori name for the North island, \"Te Ika a Maui\" (\"The fish of Maui\") reflects this legend.\n\nFor the Māori, the \"hei matau\" is taonga (a cultural treasure). It represents not only their land, but also prosperity, fertility and safe passage over water. They also denote the importance of fishing to Māori, and their relationship to Tangaroa god of the sea.\n\nTraditionally, \"matau\", or fishhooks, were carved from bone, ivory, shell, wood, or pounamu; composite hooks were also common. They came in several different forms. There are multiple apparently functional matau forms, but the functions of some are not known. Some were plain and utilitarian; others highly ornate. They were worn as pendants for safekeeping, and were often treasured family heirlooms.\n\nToday, their main use is ornamental and they are commonly worn around the neck not only by Māori, but also by other New Zealanders who identify with the \"hei matau\" as a symbol of New Zealand. They are also popular items on the tourist market. Many modern pendants are not functional fish hooks.\n\nIn contemporary times, \"hei matau\" are commonly carved from cattle bone. Some Māori carvers continue to use whale bone, and such pieces are highly valued not only because of the beauty of whale bone and its cultural and historical significance, but also its scarcity. Current laws against hunting whales mean that Māori bone-carvers who carve in whale bone must use a combination of ancient standings or pre-existing supplies, or bones from whales that have recently beached. According to New Zealand tradition and law, Māori have first claim on part of the skeletons of any whales which strand and cannot be refloated. This is, however, a very limited supply.\n\nManufacturers in China mass-produce items resembling \"hei matau\" for sale on the New Zealand tourist market. These are usually made of a paste of bone and resin. Such manufacturers have attracted criticism for their appropriation of Māori designs.\n\n\n"}

HMML’s mission is to identify, digitally photograph, catalog, and archive the contents of manuscripts belonging to threatened communities and to make the copies available to users around the world through online catalogs.\n\nSince its founding in 1965, HMML has partnered with 540 libraries and archives to photograph more than 140,000 manuscript books dating from the ancient to early modern eras, totaling some 40,000,000 handwritten pages. HMML serves three constituencies: communities or libraries with endangered manuscript collections; scholars who research manuscript and textual history; and the non-specialist general public interested in the transmission of human knowledge and artistic creativity in manuscript form.\n\nIn October 2015, HMML launched a new and comprehensive online resource for manuscript studies, vHMML or “Virtual HMML.\" at www.vhmml.org. A crucial extension of vHMML, vHMML Reading Room, went live at the end in the summer of 2016: https://www.vhmml.org/readingRoom/. vHMML Reading Room gives registered users access to HMML’s photographic manuscript archives from around the world. The initial collections available in vHMML Reading Room include representative samples of HMML’s diverse microfilm and digital resources, including images from Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and India. Highlights include manuscripts from Iraq and the famed Timbuktu manuscripts of Mali.\n\nOver 6,000 complete manuscripts in thirty languages are now in vHMML Reading Room. vHMML Reading Room lets users search for manuscripts by country, repository, author, language, genre, date, features, city or even script. Even uncataloged collections will be hosted in vHMML Reading Room, lowering all barriers to scholarly access. Users can contribute cataloging metadata using a simple tool only a click away. Researchers can view a highly-zoomable single page or view the manuscript as a larger whole.\n\nIn addition to its manuscript collections, HMML holds works of art and rare printed books from the Middle Ages to the present and is home to \"The Saint John's Bible\", the first handwritten and illuminated Bible to have been commissioned by a Benedictine Abbey since the invention of the printing press in the 15th century.\n\nSince 2003, Columba Stewart, a monk of Saint John's Abbey, has served as HMML's executive director. HMML is located in the Alcuin Library, designed by Hungarian architect Marcel Breuer.\n\nHMML serves as the preservation archive in the event that original manuscripts are destroyed, stolen, or otherwise lost. For each collection to be digitized, HMML signs a contract with the owners of the manuscripts, who then receive copies of the images and retain commercial and publication rights. Collections never leave the owners. On-site digitizing work is done by local technicians trained and paid by HMML. Administrative and funding activities are based at HMML’s location in Collegeville, Minnesota, while catalogers from both Collegeville as well as from several countries contribute to the creation of metadata for the recently-digitized manuscripts. In addition, HMML maintains a field office in Beirut, Lebanon.\n\nThe Benedictine monks of Saint John's Abbey founded HMML in 1965 as a response to the loss of manuscripts and books in European libraries during two World Wars. Their plan was to create a microfilm collection of monastic manuscripts in Minnesota for safekeeping in the event that there would be another European war. Their work soon grew to include the microfilming of other manuscript collections throughout Europe and Ethiopia. HMML expanded its focus in 2003 to include the preservation of manuscripts from other Eastern Christian traditions. Two factors drove this decision: the importance of Eastern Christian cultures to world history and the unstable conditions found in many of the historic regions of Eastern Christianity. With the launch of this project, HMML began using digital technology to preserve collections. In addition to digitizing Christian manuscripts, HMML has also digitized Islamic manuscripts collections from libraries in Harar, Ethiopia and the Old City of Jerusalem. In 2014, HMML began working with SAVAMA-DCI, a malian N60 founded by Dr. Abdel Kader Haidara, to digitize over 200,000 historic documents and manuscripts that were smuggled out of Timbuktu in 2013 and kept safe from radical Islamist rebels who were destroying works they considered to be in conflict with strict Islamic teachings. The copying of these Timbuktu Manuscripts is the largest project, by volume, of the HMML.\n\nHMML holds photographic copies of more than 140,000 manuscript books and other handwritten documents from hundreds of partner libraries spread across Europe, Africa, and Asia. Manuscripts photographed before 2003 are in microfilm format (especially collections from western Europe, Mali, Ethiopia and Malta), while later collections have been photographed digitally (Middle East, India, and recent projects in Ethiopia and Europe). HMML also has about 10,000 rare books, as well as medieval and early modern manuscripts from Europe and Africa. The Arca Artium art collection at HMML includes approximately 6,000 works of art—chiefly printed works (woodcuts, engravings, linoleum cuts, lithographs, etc.) \n\nHMML provides bibliographic support for the microfilm and digital collections through its online database \"OLIVER\" and \"Vivarium\". The printed book collections are cataloged in MnPALS and WorldCat. \"Vivarium\" provides access to research collections of related interest that reside at other institutions, including the Ethiopian Manuscript Imaging Project (EMIP). To support the use of its research collections, HMML maintains reference collections dedicated to manuscript studies, printing, art, and architecture.\n\nThe manuscript image collections at HMML are centered in four larger groupings, with several smaller collections.\n\nOf the roughly 10,000 titles in HMML’s printed books collection, nearly half were printed before 1800, with 65 incunabula and over 800 sixteenth-century imprints. Topics covered include: theology, monasticism, biblical studies, patristics, homiletics, liturgical studies, and modern fine press books. Among these is a large collection of printed Bibles from the fifteenth to twentieth centuries. HMML also receives donated rare books and other gifts. The Special Collections at HMML hold a broad range of manuscripts in Latin, German, Italian, Spanish and French, as well as some in Gə’əz and Arabic.\n\nHMML offers a year-round program of temporary exhibits of both selected manuscripts and rare books drawn from its collections.\n\nHMML has been featured in many international news stories in early 2017, including NPR's \"Here and Now\", \"The Atlantic\": \"The Monk Who Saved Manuscripts from ISIS,\" BBC World Service (story begins at 33:10 mark); Australia's \"The World Today\"; The Vatican's \"L'Obsservatore Romano\"; PBS' Religion and Ethics Newsweekly; Katholisch.de; \"National Catholic Register\", \"A Minnesota Monk Takes on ISIS.\"\n\nOther articles include: \"Faith's Archivists: Catholic monks in Minnesota are helping to save a trove of treasures in Mali,\" \"Piece By Piece, Monks Scramble To Preserve Iraq's Christian History\", \"Preserving Words and Worlds\", \"Ancient Christians in India\", \"A Monk Saves Threatened Manuscripts Using Ultramodern Means\", \"Codices Decoded\", \"In the Footsteps of the Apostles\", and \"Monastery Works to Preserve Ancient Christian Texts\", narrated by Fred de Sam Lazaro, who also produced and directed a 30-minute documentary on HMML entitled, \"Saving the Sacred.\" \n\n"}

Related to the concept of legal liability, hospitality laws are intended to protect both hosts and guests against injury, whether accidental or intentional.\n\nHotels and other business operators are expected to \"act prudently and use reasonable care\" to ensure that their premises are (reasonably) free of risk. While not specifically requiring that a business owner ensure his guests are safe, most jurisdictions interpret 'prudent and reasonable' to include foreseeable dangers, such as tripping hazards or unsecured shelving.\n\nIn most cases, unless directly disclaimed (for example, with some insurance waivers), hospitality law does not protect a business owner against charges of negligence.\n\nCommon law holds innkeepers liable for any loss of guest property when the guest is on the premises of a place of business; in practice, such liability is often overlooked provided that the business owner meets certain conditions (such as having a guest sign a waiver of liability). In most countries, for liability waivers to be enforceable, notification of the waiver must be posted in an accessible, visible location (usually at the front desk or in a common area of the business), and must be printed in clearly legible text.\n\nAmerican hospitality statutes also govern bailments. A bailment is the \"delivery of an item of property, for some purpose, with the expressed or implied understanding that the person receiving it shall return it in the same or similar condition in which it was received, when the purpose has been completed.\" Coat checks, safety deposit boxes, and luggage storage are common examples of bailments for the hospitality industry.\n\nThe \"Laws of Innkeepers\" by John E.H.

{"id": "1165345", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1165345", "title": "Intelligent design movement", "text": "Intelligent design movement\n\nThe intelligent design movement is a neo-creationist religious campaign for broad social, academic and political change to promote and support the pseudoscientific idea of intelligent design (ID), which asserts that \"certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as natural selection.\" Its chief activities are a campaign to promote public awareness of this concept, the lobbying of policymakers to include its teaching in high school science classes, and legal action, either to defend such teaching or to remove barriers otherwise preventing it. The movement arose out of the creation science movement in the United States, and is driven by a small group of proponents.\n\nThe overall goal of the intelligent design movement is to overthrow materialism and atheism. Its proponents believe that society has suffered \"devastating\" cultural consequences from adopting materialism and that science is the cause of the decay into materialism because it seeks only natural explanations, and is therefore atheistic. They believe that the scientific theory of evolution implies that humans have no spiritual nature, no moral purpose, and no intrinsic meaning. They seek to \"reverse the stifling dominance of the materialist worldview\", represented by the theory of evolution, in favor of \"a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions.\"\n\nTo achieve their goal of defeating a materialistic world view, advocates of intelligent design take a two-pronged approach. Alongside the promotion of intelligent design, proponents also seek to \"Teach the Controversy\"; discredit evolution by emphasizing perceived flaws in the theory of evolution, or disagreements within the scientific community and encourage teachers and students to explore non-scientific alternatives to evolution, or to critically analyze evolution and the controversy surrounding the teaching of evolution. But the world's largest general scientific society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, has stated that \"There is no significant controversy within the scientific community about the validity of evolution.\" and that \"Evolution is one of the most robust and widely accepted principles of modern science.\" The ruling in the 2005 Dover, Pennsylvania, trial, \"Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District\", where the claims of intelligent design proponents were considered by a United States federal court, stated that \"evolution, including common descent and natural selection, is 'overwhelmingly accepted' by the scientific community.\"\n\nThe Discovery Institute (DI) is a religious think tank that drives the intelligent design movement. The Institute's Center for Science and Culture (CSC) counts most of the leading intelligent design advocates among its membership, most notably its program advisor Phillip E. Johnson. Johnson is the architect of the movement's key strategies, the wedge strategy and the \"Teach the Controversy\" campaign. The Discovery Institute and leading proponents represent intelligent design as a revolutionary scientific theory. The overwhelming majority of the scientific community, as represented by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the National Academy of Sciences and nearly all scientific professional organizations, firmly reject these claims, and insist that intelligent design is not valid science, its proponents having failed to conduct an actual scientific research program. This has led the movement's critics to state that intelligent design is merely a public relations campaign and a political campaign.\n\nAccording to critics of the intelligent design movement, the movement's purpose is political rather than scientific or educational. They claim the movement's \"activities betray an aggressive, systematic agenda for promoting not only intelligent design creationism, but the religious worldview that undergirds it.\" Intelligent design is an attempt to recast religious dogma in an effort to reintroduce the teaching of biblical creationism to public school science classrooms; the intelligent design movement is an effort to reshape American society into a theocracy, primarily through education. As evidence, critics cite the Discovery Institute's political activities, its wedge strategy and statements made by leading intelligent design proponents. The scientific community's position, as represented by the National Academy of Sciences and the National Center for Science Education (NCSE), is that intelligent design is not science, but creationist pseudoscience. Richard Dawkins, a biologist and professor at Oxford University, compares the intelligent design movement's demand to \"teach the controversy\" with the demand to teach flat Earthism; acceptable in terms of history, but not in terms of science. \"If you give the idea that there are two schools of thought within science--one that says the earth is round and one that says the earth is flat--you are misleading children.\"\n\nAt the 1999 \"Reclaiming America for Christ Conference\" called by Reverend D. James Kennedy of Coral Ridge Ministries, Phillip E. Johnson gave a speech called \"How The Evolution Debate Can Be Won.\" In it he sums up the theological and epistemological underpinnings of intelligent design and its strategy for victory:\n\nThe intelligent design movement grew out of a creationist tradition which argues against evolutionary theory from a religious standpoint, usually that of evangelical or fundamentalistic Christianity. Although intelligent design advocates often claim that they are arguing only for the existence of a designer who may or may not be God, all the movement's leading advocates believe that this designer is God. They frequently accompany their arguments with a discussion of religious issues, especially when addressing religious audiences, but elsewhere downplay the religious aspects of their agenda.\n\nThe modern use of the words \"intelligent design,\" as a term intended to describe a field of inquiry, began after the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of \"Edwards v. Aguillard\" (1987), ruled that creationism is unconstitutional in public school science curricula. A Discovery Institute report says that Charles Thaxton, editor of \"Of Pandas and People\", had picked the phrase up from a NASA scientist, and thought \"That's just what I need, it's a good engineering term.\" In drafts of the book over one hundred uses of the root word \"creation,\" such as \"creationism\" and \"creation science,\" were changed, almost without exception, to \"intelligent design,\" while \"creationists\" was changed to \"design proponents\" or, in one instance, \"cdesign proponentsists.\" In 1989, \"Of Pandas and People\" was published by the Foundation for Thought and Ethics (FTE), with the definition:\n\n\"Pandas\" was followed in 1991 by \"Darwin on Trial\", a neo-creationist polemic by Phillip E. Johnson, that is regarded as a central text of the movement. \"Darwin on Trial\" mentioned \"Pandas\" as \"'creationist' only in the sense that it juxtaposes a paradigm of 'intelligent design' with the dominant paradigm of (naturalistic) evolution,\" but his use of the term as a focus for his wedge strategy promoting \"theistic realism\" came later. The book was reviewed by evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould for \"Scientific American\" in July 1992, concluding that the book contains \"...no weighing of evidence, no careful reading of literature on all sides, no full citation of sources (the book does not even contain a bibliography) and occasional use of scientific literature only to score rhetorical points.\" Gould's review led to the formation in 1992 or 1993 of an 'Ad Hoc Origins Committee' of Johnson's supporters, which wrote a letter, circulated to thousands of university professors, defending the book. Among the 39 signatories were nine who later became members of the Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture (CRSC).\n\nDuring the early 1990s Johnson worked to develop a 'big tent' movement to unify a wide range of creationist viewpoints in opposition to evolution. In 1992, the first formal meeting devoted to intelligent design was held in Southern Methodist University. It included a debate between Johnson and Michael Ruse (a key witness in \"McLean v. Arkansas\" (1982)) and papers by William A. Dembski, Michael Behe and Stephen C. Meyer. In 1993, Johnson organized a follow-up meeting, including Dembski, Behe, Meyer, Dean H. Kenyon (co-author of \"Pandas\") and Walter Bradley (co-author with Thaxton and Kenyon of \"The Mystery of Life's Origin\" (1984)), as well as two graduate students, Paul A. Nelson and Jonathan Wells.\n\nOn December 6, 1993, an article by Meyer was published in \"The Wall Street Journal\", drawing national attention to the controversy over Dean H. Kenyon's teaching of creationism. This article also gained the attention of Discovery Institute co-founder Bruce Chapman. On discovering that Meyer was developing the idea of starting a scientific research center in conversations with conservative political scientist John G. West, Chapman invited them to create a unit within the Discovery Institute called the Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture (later renamed the Center for Science and Culture). This center was dedicated to overthrowing \"scientific materialism\" and \"fomenting nothing less than a scientific and cultural revolution.\"\nA 1995 conference, \"The Death of Materialism and the Renewal of Culture,\" served as a blueprint for the center. By 1996 they had nearly a million dollars in grants, the largest being from Howard Ahmanson, Jr., with smaller but still large contributions coming from the Stewardship Foundation established by C. Davis Weyerhaeuser and the Maclellan Foundation, and appointed their first class of research fellows.\n\nThe wedge strategy was formulated by Phillip E. Johnson to combat the \"evil\" of methodological naturalism. It first came to the general public's attention when a Discovery Institute internal memo now known as the \"Wedge Document\" (believed to have been written in 1998) was leaked to the public in 1999. However it is believed to have been update of an earlier document to be implemented between 1996 and 2001.\n\nThe document begins with \"The proposition that human beings are created in the image of God is one of the bedrock principles on which Western civilization was built.\" and then goes on to outline the movement's goal to exploit perceived discrepancies within evolutionary theory in order to discredit evolution and scientific materialism in general. Much of the strategy is directed toward the broader public, as opposed to the professional scientific community. The stated \"governing goals\" of the CSC's wedge strategy are:\n\nCritics of intelligent design movement argue that the Wedge Document and strategy demonstrate that the intelligent design movement is motivated purely by religion and political ideology and that the Discovery Institute as a matter of policy obfuscates its agenda. The Discovery Institute's official response was to characterize the criticism and concern as \"irrelevant,\" \"paranoid,\" and \"near-panic\" while portraying the Wedge Document as a \"fund-raising document.\"\n\nJohnson in his 1997 book \"Defeating Darwinism by Opening Minds\" confirmed some of the concerns voiced by the movement's gainsayers:\n\nThe Kansas evolution hearings were a series of hearings held in Topeka, Kansas, from May 5 to May 12, 2005, by the Kansas State Board of Education and its State Board Science Hearing Committee to change how evolution and the origin of life would be taught in the state's public high school science classes. The hearings were arranged by the conservative Board with the intent of introducing intelligent design into science classes via the \"Teach the Controversy\" method.\n\nThe hearings raised the issues of creation and evolution in public education and were attended by all the major participants in the intelligent design movement but were ultimately boycotted by the scientific community over concern of lending credibility to the claim, made by proponents of intelligent design, that evolution is purportedly the subject of wide dispute within the scientific and science education communities.\n\nThe Discovery Institute, hub of the intelligent design movement, played a central role in starting the hearings by promoting its Critical Analysis of Evolution lesson plan which the Kansas State Board of Education eventually adopted over objections of the State Board Science Hearing Committee, and campaigning on behalf of conservative Republican candidates for the Board.\n\nLocal science advocacy group Kansas Citizens for Science organized a boycott of the hearings by mainstream scientists, who accused it of being a kangaroo court and argued that their participation would lend an undeserved air of legitimacy to the hearings. Board member Kathy Martin declared at the beginning of the hearings \"Evolution has been proven false. ID (Intelligent Design) is science-based and strong in facts.\" At their conclusion she proclaimed that evolution is \"an unproven, often disproven\" theory.\n\n\"ID has theological implications. ID is not strictly Christian, but it is theistic,\" asserted Martin. The scientific community rejects teaching intelligent design as science; a leading example being the National Academy of Sciences, which issued a policy statement saying \"Creationism, intelligent design, and other claims of supernatural intervention in the origin of life or of species are not science because they are not testable by the methods of science.\"\n\nOn February 13, 2007, the Board voted 6 to 4 to reject the amended science standards enacted in 2005.\n\nIn the movement's sole major case, \"Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District\", it was represented by the Thomas More Law Center, which had been seeking a test-case on the issue for at least five years. However conflicting agendas resulted in the withdrawal of a number of Discovery Institute Fellows as expert witnesses, at the request of DI director Bruce Chapman, and mutual recriminations with the DI after the case was lost. The Alliance Defense Fund briefly represented the Foundation for Thought and Ethics in its unsuccessful motion to intervene in this case, and prepared \"amicus curiae\" briefs on behalf of the DI and FTE in it. It has also made \"amicus curiae\" submissions and offered to pay for litigation, in other (actual and potential) creationism-related cases. On a far smaller scale, Larry Caldwell and his wife operate under the name Quality Science Education for All, and have made a number of lawsuits in furtherance of the movement's anti-evolution agenda. In 2005 they brought at least three separate lawsuits to further the intelligent design movement's agenda. One was later abandoned, two were dismissed.\n\nIntelligent design advocates realize that their arguments have little chance of acceptance within the mainstream scientific community, so they direct them toward politicians, philosophers and the general public. What prima facie \"scientific\" material they have produced has been attacked by critics as containing factual misrepresentation and misleading, rhetorical and equivocal terminology. A number of documentaries that promote their assertion that intelligent design as an increasingly well-supported line of scientific inquiry have been made for the Discovery Institute. The bulk of the material produced by the intelligent design movement, however, is not intended to be scientific but rather to promote its social and political aims. Polls indicate that intelligent design's main appeal to citizens comes from its link to religious concepts.\n\nAn August 2005 poll from The Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life showed 64% of Americans favoring the teaching of creationism along with evolution in science classrooms, though only 38% favored teaching it instead of evolution, with the results varying deeply by education level and religiosity. The poll showed the educated were far less attached to intelligent design than the less educated. Evangelicals and fundamentalists showed high rates of affiliation with intelligent design while other religious persons and the secular were much lower.\n\nScientists responding to a poll overwhelmingly said intelligent design is about religion, not science. A 2002 sampling of 460 Ohio science professors had 91% say it's primarily religion, 93% say there is not \"any scientifically valid evidence or an alternate scientific theory that challenges the fundamental principles of the theory of evolution,\" and 97% say that they did not use intelligent design concepts in their own research.\n\nIn October and November 2001, the Discovery Institute advertised \"A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism\" in three national publications (\"The New York Review of Books\", \"The New Republic\" and \"The Weekly Standard\"), listing what they claimed were \"100 scientific dissenters\" who had signed a statement that \"We are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life. Careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged.\" Shortly afterwards the National Center for Science Education described the wording as misleading, noting that a minority of the signatories were biologists and some of the others were engineers, mathematicians and philosophers, and that some signatories did not fully support the Discovery Institute's claims. The list was further criticized in a February 2006 article in \"The New York Times\" which pointed out that only 25% of the signatories by then were biologists and that signatories' \"doubts about evolution grew out of their religious beliefs.\" In 2003, as a humorous parody of such listings the NCSE produced the pro-evolution Project Steve list of signatories, all with variations of the name Steve and most of whom are trained biologists. As of July 31, 2006, the Discovery Institute lists \"over 600 scientists,\" while Project Steve reported 749 signatories; as of May 30, 2014, 1,338 Steves have signed the statement, while 906 have signed \"A Scientific Dissent from Darwinism\" as of April 2014.\n\nThe movement's strategy as set forth by Phillip E. Johnson states the replacement of \"materialist science\" with \"theistic science\" as its primary goal; and, more generally, for intelligent design to become \"the dominant perspective in science\" and to \"permeate our religious, cultural, moral and political life.\" This agenda is now being actively pursued by the Center for Science and Culture, which plays the leading role in the promotion of intelligent design. Its fellows include most of the leading intelligent design advocates: William A. Dembski, Michael Behe, Jonathan Wells and Stephen C. Meyer.\n\nIntelligent design has been described by its proponents as a 'big tent' belief, one in which all theists united by having some kind of creationist belief (but of differing opinions as regards details) can support. If successfully promoted, it would reinstate creationism in the teaching of science, after which debates regarding details could resume. In his 2002 article in \"Christian Research Journal\", Discovery Institute fellow Paul A. Nelson credits Johnson for the 'big tent' approach and for reviving creationist debate since the \"Edwards v. Aguillard\" decision. According to Nelson, \"The promise of the big tent of ID is to provide a setting where Christians (and others) may disagree amicably, and fruitfully, about how best to understand the natural world, as well as Scripture.\"\n\nIn his presentation to the 1999 \"Reclaiming America for Christ Conference,\" \"How The Evolution Debate Can Be Won,\" Johnson affirmed this 'big tent' role for \"The Wedge\" (without using the term intelligent design):\n\nThe Discovery Institute consistently denies allegations that its intelligent design agenda has religious foundations, and downplays the religious source of much of its funding. In an interview of Stephen C. Meyer when \"World News Tonight\" asked about the Discovery Institute's many evangelical Christian donors the Institute's public relations representative stopped the interview saying \"I don't think we want to go down that path.\"\n\nPhillip E. Johnson, largely regarded as the leader of the movement, positions himself as a \"theistic realist\" against \"methodological naturalism\" and intelligent design as the method through which God created life. Johnson explicitly calls for intelligent design proponents to obfuscate their religious motivations so as to avoid having intelligent design recognized \"as just another way of packaging the Christian evangelical message.\" Hence intelligent design arguments are carefully formulated in secular terms and intentionally avoid positing the identity of the designer. Johnson has stated that cultivating ambiguity by employing secular language in arguments which are carefully crafted to avoid overtones of theistic creationism is a necessary first step for ultimately introducing the Christian concept of God as the designer. Johnson emphasizes \"the first thing that has to be done is to get the Bible out of the discussion\" and that \"after we have separated materialist prejudice from scientific fact\" only then can \"biblical issues\" be discussed. In the foreword to \"Creation, Evolution, & Modern Science\" (2000) Johnson writes \"The intelligent design movement starts with the recognition that 'In the beginning was the Word,' and 'In the beginning God created.' Establishing that point isn't enough, but it is absolutely essential to the rest of the gospel message.\"\n\nThe Center for Science and Culture, formerly known as the Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture, is a division of the Discovery Institute. The Center consists of a tightly knit core of people who have worked together for almost a decade to advance intelligent design as both a concept and a movement as necessary adjuncts of its wedge strategy policy. This cadre includes Phillip E. Johnson, Michael Behe, William A. Dembski and Stephen C. Meyer. They are united by a religious vision which, although it varies among the members in its particulars and is seldom acknowledged outside of the Christian press, is predicated on the shared conviction that America is in need of \"renewal\" which can be accomplished only by unseating \"Godless\" materialism and instituting religion as its cultural foundation.\n\nIn his keynote address at the \"Research and Progress in intelligent design\" (RAPID) conference held in 2002 at Biola University, William A. Dembski described intelligent design's \"dual role as a constructive scientific project and as a means for cultural renaissance.\" In a similar vein, the movement's hub, the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture had until 2002 been the \"\"Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture\".\" Explaining the name change, a spokesperson for the CSC insisted that the old name was simply too long. However, the change followed accusations that the center's real interest was not science but reforming culture along lines favored by conservative Christians.\n\nCritics of the movement cite the Wedge Document as confirmation of this criticism and assert that the movement's leaders, particularly Phillip E. Johnson, view the subject as a culture war: \"Darwinian evolution is not primarily important as a scientific theory but as a culturally dominant creation story. ... When there is radical disagreement in a commonwealth about the creation story, the stage is set for intense conflict, the kind of conflict that is known as a 'culture war.'\"\n\nRecently the Center for Science and Culture's has moderated its previous overtly theistic mission statements to appeal to a broader, a more secular audience. It hopes to accomplish this by using less overtly theistic messages and language. Despite this, the Center for Science and Culture still states as a goal a redefinition of science, and the philosophy on which it is based, particularly the exclusion of what it calls the \"unscientific principle of materialism,\" and in particular the acceptance of what it calls \"the scientific theory of intelligent design.\"\n\nPromotional materials from the Discovery Institute acknowledge that the Ahmanson family donated $1.5 million to the Center for Science and Culture, then known as the Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture, for a research and publicity program to \"unseat not just Darwinism but also Darwinism's cultural legacy.\" Mr. Ahmanson funds many causes important to the Christian religious right, including Christian Reconstructionism, whose goal is to place the US \"under the control of biblical law.\" Until 1995, Ahmanson sat on the board of the Christian Reconstructionist Chalcedon Foundation.\n\n\nThe intelligent design movement primarily campaigns on two fronts: a public relations campaign meant to influence the popular media and sway public opinion; and an aggressive lobbying campaign to cultivate support for the teaching of intelligent design amongst policymakers and the wider educational community. Both these activities are largely funded and directed by the Discovery Institute, from national to grassroots levels. The movement's first goal is to establish an acceptance of intelligent design at the expense of evolution in public school science; its long-term goal is no less than the \"renewal\" of American culture through the shaping of public policy to reflect conservative Christian values. As the Discovery Institute states, intelligent design is central to this agenda: \"Design theory promises to reverse the stifling dominance of the materialist worldview, and to replace it with a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions.\"\n\nThe Discovery Institute has also relied on several polls to indicate the acceptance of intelligent design. A 2005 Harris poll identified ten percent of adults in the United States as taking what they called the intelligent design position, that \"human beings are so complex that they required a powerful force or intelligent being to help create them.\" (64% agreed with the creationist view that \"human beings were created directly by God\" and 22% believed that \"human beings evolved from earlier species.\" 49% accepted plant and animal evolution, while 45% did not.) Although some polls commissioned by the Discovery Institute show more support, these polls have been criticized as suffering from considerable flaws, such as having a low response rate (248 out of 16,000), being conducted on behalf of an organization with an expressed interest in the outcome of the poll, and containing leading questions.\n\nCritics of intelligent design and its movement contend that intelligent design is a specific form of creationism, neo-creationism, a viewpoint rejected by intelligent design advocates. It was bolstered by the 2005 ruling in United States federal court that a public school district requirement for science classes to teach that intelligent design is an alternative to evolution was a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. In \"Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District\", United States District Judge John E. Jones III that intelligent design is not science and is essentially religious in nature.\n\nIn pursuing the goal of establishing intelligent design at the expense of evolution in public school science, intelligent design groups have threatened and isolated high school science teachers, school board members and parents who opposed their efforts. Responding to the well-organized curricular challenges of intelligent design proponents to local school boards have been disruptive and divisive in the communities where they've taken place. The campaigns run by intelligent design groups place teachers in the difficult position of arguing against their employers while the legal challenges to local school districts are costly and divert scarce funds away from education into court battles. Although these court battles have almost invariably resulted in the defeat of intelligent design proponents, they are draining and divisive to local schools. For example, as a result of \"Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District\" trial, the Dover Area School District was forced to pay $1,000,011 in legal fees and damages for pursuing a policy of \"teaching the controversy\" - presenting intelligent design as an allegedly scientific alternative to evolution.\nLeading members of the intelligent design movement are also associated with denialism, both Phillip E. Johnson and Jonathan Wells have signed an AIDS denialism petition.\n\nThe Discovery Institute, through its Center for Science and Culture, has formulated a number of campaigns to promote intelligent design, while discrediting evolutionary biology, which the Institute terms \"Darwinism.\"\n\nProminent Institute campaigns have been to \"Teach the Controversy\" and, more recently, to allow Critical Analysis of Evolution. Other prominent campaigns have claimed that intelligent design advocates (most notably Richard Sternberg) have been discriminated against, and thus that Academic Freedom bills are needed to protect academics' and teachers' ability to criticise evolution, and that there is a link from evolution to ideologies such as Nazism and eugenics. These three claims are all publicised in the pro-ID movie \"\" (2008). Other campaigns have included petitions, most notably \"A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism\".\n\nThe response of the scientific community has been to reiterate that the theory of evolution is overwhelmingly accepted as a matter of scientific consensus whereas intelligent design has been rejected by the overwhelming majority of the scientific community (see list of scientific societies explicitly rejecting intelligent design).\n\nThe main battlefield for this culture war has been US regional and state school boards. Courts have also become involved as those campaigns to include intelligent design or weaken the teaching of evolution in public school science curricula are challenged on First Amendment grounds. In \"Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District\", the plaintiffs successfully argued that intelligent design is a form of creationism, and that the school board policy thus violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.\n\nIntelligent design is an integral part of a political campaign by cultural conservatives, largely from evangelical religious convictions, that seek to redefine science to suit their own ideological agenda. Though numerically a minority of Americans. the politics of intelligent design is based less on numbers than on intensive mobilization of ideologically committed followers and savvy public relations campaigns. Political repercussions from the culturally conservative sponsorship of the issue has been divisive and costly to the effected communities, polarizing and dividing not only those directly charged with educating young people but entire local communities.\n\nWith a doctrine that calls itself science among non-scientists but is rejected by the vast majority of the real practitioners, an amicable coexistence and collaboration between intelligent design advocates and upholders of mainstream science education standards is rare. With mainstream scientific and educational organizations saying the theory of evolution is not \"in crisis\" or a subject doubted by scientists, nor intelligent design the emergent scientific paradigm or rival theory its proponents proclaim, \"teaching the controversy\" is suitable for classes on politics, history, culture, or theology they say, but not science. By attempting to force the issue into science classrooms, intelligent design proponents create a charged environment that forces participants and bystanders alike to declare their positions, which has resulted in intelligent design groups threatening and isolating high school science teachers, school board members and parents who opposed their efforts.\n\nIn a round table discussion entitled \"Science Wars: Should Schools Teach Intelligent Design?\" at the American Enterprise Institute on 21 October 2005 and televised on C-SPAN, the Discovery Institute's Mark Ryland and the Thomas More Law Center's Richard Thompson had a frank disagreement, in which Ryland claimed the Discovery Institute has always cautioned against the teaching of intelligent design, and Thompson responded that the Institute's leadership had not only advocated the teaching of intelligent design, but encouraged others to do so, and that the Dover Area School District had merely followed the Institute's calls for action. As evidence, Thompson cited the Discovery Institute's guidebook \"Intelligent Design in Public School Science Curricula\" written by the Institute's co-founder and first director, Stephen C. Meyer, and David K. DeWolf, a CSC Fellow, which stated in its closing paragraphs: \"Moreover, as the previous discussion demonstrates, school boards have the authority to permit, and even encourage, teaching about design theory as an alternative to Darwinian evolution -- and this includes the use of textbooks such as \"Of Pandas and People\" that present evidence for the theory of intelligent design.\"\n\nIn 1999, William A. Dembski was invited by Baylor University president Robert B. Sloan to form the Michael Polanyi Center, described by Dembski as \"the first Intelligent Design think tank at a research university.\" Its creation was controversial with Baylor faculty, and in 2000 it was merged with the Institute for Faith and Learning. Dembski, although remaining as a research professor until 2005, was given no courses to teach.\n\nTwo universities have offered courses in intelligent design: Oklahoma Baptist University, where ID advocate Michael Newton Keas taught 'Unified Studies: Introduction to Biology,' and Biola University, host of the Mere Creation conference. Additionally, numerous Christian evangelical institutions have faculty with interests in intelligent design. These include Oral Roberts University and Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary. Patrick Henry College teaches creationism but also exposes its students to both Darwinian evolution and intelligent design.\n\nIn 2005, the American Association of University Professors issued a strongly worded statement asserting that the theory of evolution is nearly universally accepted in the community of scholars, and deploring requirements \"to make students aware of an 'intelligent-design hypothesis' to account for the origins of life.\" It said that such requirements are \"inimical to principles of academic freedom.\"\n\nMuch of the actual debate over intelligent design between intelligent design proponents and members of the scientific community has taken place on the Web, primarily blogs and message boards, instead of the scientific journals and symposia where traditionally much science is discussed and settled. In promoting intelligent design the actions of its proponents have been more like a political pressure group than like researchers entering an academic debate as described by movement critic Taner Edis. The movement lacks any verifiable scientific research program and concomitant debates in academic circles.\n\nThe Web continues to play a central role in the Discovery Institute's strategy of promotion of intelligent design and it adjunct campaigns. On September 6, 2006, on the Center's \"Evolution News & Views\" blog, Discovery Institute staffer Casey Luskin published a post entitled \"Putting Wikipedia On Notice About Their Biased Anti-ID Intelligent Design Entries.\" In the post, Luskin reprinted a letter from a reader complaining that Wikipedia's coverage of ID to be \"one sided\" and that pro-intelligent design editors were censored and attacked. Along with the letter, Luskin published a Wikipedia email address for general information and urged readers \"to contact Wikipedia to express your feelings about the biased nature of the entries on intelligent design.\"\n\nDespite being primarily based in the United States, there have been efforts to introduce pro-intelligent design teaching material into educational facilities in other countries. In the United Kingdom, the group Truth in Science has used material from the Discovery Institute to create free teaching packs which have been mass-mailed to all UK schools. Shortly after this emerged, government ministers announced that they regarded intelligent design to be creationism and unsuitable for teaching in the classroom. They also announced that the teaching of the material in science classes was to be prohibited.\n\nOne of the most common criticisms of the movement and its leadership is that of intellectual dishonesty, in the form of misleading impressions created by the use of rhetoric, intentional ambiguity, and misrepresented evidence. It is alleged that its goal is to lead an unwary public to reach certain conclusions, and that many have been deceived as a result. Critics of the movement, such as Eugenie Scott, Robert T. Pennock and Barbara Forrest, claim that leaders of the intelligent design movement, and the Discovery Institute in particular, knowingly misquote scientists and other experts, deceptively omit contextual text through ellipsis, and make unsupported amplifications of relationships and credentials. Theologian and molecular biophysicist Alister McGrath has a number of criticisms of the Intelligent design movement, stating that \"those who adopt this approach make Christianity deeply... vulnerable to scientific progress\" and defining it as just another \"god-of-the-gaps\" theory. He went on to criticize the movement on theological grounds as well, stating \"It is not an approach I accept, either on scientific or theological grounds.\"\n\nSuch statements commonly note the institutional affiliations of signatories for purposes of identification. But this statement strategically listed either the institution that granted a signatory's PhD or the institutions with which the individual is presently affiliated. Thus the institutions listed for Raymond G. Bohlin, Fazale Rana, and Jonathan Wells, for example, were the University of Texas, Ohio University, and the University of California, Berkeley, respectively, where they earned their degrees, rather than their current affiliations: \"Probe Ministries\" for Bohlin, \"Reasons to Believe\" ministry for Rana, and the Discovery Institute's \"Center for Science and Culture\" for Wells. Similarly confusing lists of local scientists were circulated during controversies over evolution education in Georgia, New Mexico, Ohio, and Texas. In another instance, the Discovery Institute frequently mentions the Nobel Prize in connection with Henry F. Schaefer, III, a CSC Fellow, and chemist at the University of Georgia. Critics allege that Discovery Institute is inflating his reputation by constantly referring to him as a \"five-time nominee for the Nobel Prize\" because Nobel Prize nominations remain confidential for fifty years.\n\nThis criticism is not reserved only to the Institute; individual intelligent design proponents have been accused of using their own credentials and those of others in a misleading or confusing fashion. For example, critics allege William A. Dembski gratuitously invokes his laurels by boasting of his correspondence with a Nobel laureate, bragging that one of his books was published in a series whose editors include a Nobel laureate, and exulting that the publisher of the intelligent design book \"The Mystery of Life's Origin\", Philosophical Library, also published books by eight Nobel laureates. Critics claim that Dembski purposefully omits relevant facts which he fails to mention to his audience that in 1986, during the \"Edwards v. Aguillard\" hearings, 72 Nobel laureates endorsed an \"amicus curiae\" brief that noted that the \"evolutionary history of organisms has been as extensively tested and as thoroughly corroborated as any biological concept.\"\n\nAnother common criticism is that since no intelligent design research has been published in mainstream, peer-reviewed scientific journals, the Discovery Institute often misuses the work of mainstream scientists by putting out lists of articles that allegedly support their arguments for intelligent design drawing from mainstream scientific literature. Often, the original authors respond that their articles cited by the center don't support their arguments at all. Many times, the original authors have publicly refuted them for distorting the meaning of something they've written for their own purposes.\n\nSahotra Sarkar, a molecular biologist at the University of Texas, has testified that intelligent design advocates, and specifically the Discovery Institute, have misused his work by misrepresenting its conclusions to bolster their own claims, has gone on to allege that the extent of the misrepresentations rises to the level of professional malfeasance:\n\nAn October 2005 conference called \"When Christians and Cultures Clash\" was held in Christ Hall at Evangelical School of Theology in Myerstown, Pennsylvania. Attorney Randall L. Wenger, who is affiliated with the Alliance Defense Fund, and a close ally of the Discovery Institute, and one of the presenters at the conference advocated the use of subterfuge for advancing the movement's religious goals: \"But even with God's blessing, it's helpful to consult a lawyer before joining the battle... For instance, the Dover area school board might have had a better case for the intelligent design disclaimer they inserted into high school biology classes had they not mentioned a religious motivation at their meetings... Give us a call before you do something controversial like that... I think we need to do a better job at being clever as serpents.\"\n\n\n"}

In corporate or commercial settings, greater importance is attached to the delivery of a keynote speech or keynote address. The keynote establishes the framework for the following programme of events or convention agenda; frequently the role of keynote speaker will include that of convention moderator. It will also flag up a larger idea – a literary story, an individual musical piece, or event.\n\nAt political or industrial conventions and expositions and at academic conferences, the keynote address or keynote speech is delivered to set the underlying tone and summarize the core message or most important revelation of the event. Some of the more famous keynote speeches in the United States are those made at the party conventions during Democratic and Republican presidential campaigns. Keynote speakers at these events have often gained nationwide fame (or notoriety); for example, Barack Obama at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, and have occasionally influenced the course of the election. In the commercial arena, Steve Jobs delivered influential keynote speeches at Apple product, system and service launches.\n\nKeynote speeches are also given at the graduation and commencement ceremonies of colleges, universities, and major high schools, usually by accomplished academics or celebrities invited by the student body.\n\nKeynote speakers are often selected to raise interest in a particular event, such as a conference or large meeting sponsored by a corporation or association, and draw attendees to attend that program. Selecting a keynote speaker who is well known for his or her expertise in a particular field, or who has wide name recognition due to other accomplishments, will probably raise enthusiasm among prospective attendees for a meeting or conference. Increasingly the word \"keynote\" is being used as a synonym for plenary session or \"invited talk,\" with some conferences having an \"opening keynote,\" a \"closing keynote,\" and many other keynotes.\n\nA keynote speaker may work independently, be represented by a speakers bureau, or by a new crowdsourced model such as the \"speakerwiki\" website. In the event that a speaker is represented by a traditional speakers bureau, a commission, typically 25%–30%, is due; however, this is traditionally and ethically absorbed by the speaker rather than the client so that the fee remains flat and transparently priced to the client.\n\nThe term \"key note\" comes from the practice of a cappella, such as doo-wop or barbershop singers, playing a note before singing. The note played determines the key in which the song will be performed.\n"}
{"id": "164701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=164701", "title": "Les Nabis", "text": "Les Nabis\n\nLes Nabis () were a group of Post-Impressionist avant-garde artists who set the pace for fine arts and graphic arts in France in the 1890s. Initially a group of friends interested in contemporary art and literature, most of them studied at the private art school of Rodolphe Julian (the Académie Julian) in Paris in the late 1880s.\n\nIn 1890, they began to participate successfully in public exhibitions, while most of their artistic output remained in private hands or in the possession of the artists themselves. By 1896, the unity of the group had already begun to break: \"Homage to Cézanne\", painted by Maurice Denis in 1900, recollects memories of a time already gone, even before the term \"Nabis\" had been revealed to the public. Meanwhile, most members of the group, including Maurice Denis, Pierre Bonnard, and Édouard Vuillard, could stand on their own artistically. Only Paul Sérusier had problems to overcome—though it was his \"Talisman\", painted at the advice of Paul Gauguin, that had revealed to them the way to go.\n\n\"Nabi\" means \"prophet\" in both Hebrew and Arabic.\n\n\"Les Nabis\" originated as a rebellious group of young student artists who banded together at the Académie Julian. Paul Sérusier galvanized \"Les Nabis\" and provided the name; he also disseminated among them the example of Paul Gauguin. Pierre Bonnard, Édouard Vuillard, and Maurice Denis became the best known of the group, but at the time they were somewhat peripheral to the core group.\n\nThe term was coined by the linguist Auguste Cazalis, who drew a parallel between the way these painters aimed to revitalize painting (as \"prophets of modern art\") and the way the ancient prophets had rejuvenated Israel. Possibly, the nickname arose because \"most of them wore beards, some were Jews and all were desperately earnest\".\n\n\"Les Nabis\" regarded themselves as initiates, and used a private vocabulary. They called a studio an \"ergasterium\" and ended their letters with the initials \"E.T.P.M.V. et M.P.\", meaning \"En ta paume, mon verbe et ma pensée\" (In your palm, my word and my thoughts.)\n\nMeeting at Académie Julian, and then at the apartment of Paul Ranson, they preached that a work of art is the end product and the visual expression of an artist's synthesis of nature in personal aesthetic metaphors and symbols. Paving the way for the early 20th-century development of abstract and nonrepresentational art, they had in common with most progressive artists of the time the goal of integrating art and daily life.\n\n\"Les Nabis\" artists worked in a variety of media, using oils on both canvas and cardboard, and distemper on canvas and wall decoration, and they also produced posters, prints, book illustrations, textiles and furniture. Considered to be on the cutting edge of modern art during their early period, their subject matter was representational (though often Symbolist in inspiration), but was design-oriented along the lines of the Japanese prints they so admired, and Art Nouveau. Unlike those types, however, the artists of this circle were highly influenced by the paintings of the Impressionists, and thus while sharing the flatness, page layout, and negative space of art nouveau and other decorative modes, much of \"LesNabis\" art has a painterly, non-realistic look, with color palettes reminiscent of Cézanne and Gauguin. Bonnard's posters and lithographs are more firmly in the Art Nouveau, or Toulouse-Lautrec manner. After the turn of the century, as modern art moved towards Abstraction, Expressionism, and Cubism, \"LesNabis\" were viewed as conservatives and, indeed, were among the last group of artists to stick to the roots and artistic ambitions of the Impressionists, pursuing these ends almost into the middle of the 20th century. In their later years, these painters also largely abandoned their earlier interests in decorative and applied arts.\n\nAmong the artists who considered themselves Nabis was Maurice Denis, whose journalism put the aims of the group in the eye of a progressive audience, and whose definition of a painting\"a flat surface covered with colors assembled in a certain order\"expressed the Nabis approach. His \"Théories\" (1920; 1922) summed up the Nabis' aims long after they had been superseded by the fauve painters and by cubism.\n\nOther Nabis were Pierre Bonnard, Édouard Vuillard, Ker-Xavier Roussel, Paul Ranson, and Félix Vallotton. The sculptor Aristide Maillol was associated for a time with the group. The Scot James Pitcairn-Knowles and the Hungarian Jozsef Rippl-Ronai lived together in Paris during the first decade of the 20thcentury and also turned to glass-blowing and woodcarving. The post-Impressionist styles they embraced skirted some aspects of contemporary art nouveau and Symbolism. The influence of the English Arts and Crafts Movement set them to work in media that involved crafts beyond painting: printmaking, book illustration and poster design, textiles, and set design.\n\nOther members of the group included the playwright Pierre Veber, the musician Pierre Hermant, and the linguist Auguste Cazalis, called (by Ranson) \"le nabi Ben Kallyre\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3225498", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3225498", "title": "Libertarianism", "text": "Libertarianism\n\nLibertarianism (from , meaning \"freedom\") is a collection of political philosophies and movements that uphold liberty as a core principle. Libertarians seek to maximize political freedom and autonomy, emphasizing freedom of choice, voluntary association, and individual judgment. Libertarians share a skepticism of authority and state power, but they diverge on the scope of their opposition to existing political and economic systems. Various schools of libertarian thought offer a range of views regarding the legitimate functions of state and private power, often calling for the restriction or dissolution of coercive social institutions.\n\nTraditionally, \"libertarianism\" was a term for a form of left-wing politics; such left-libertarian ideologies seek to abolish capitalism and private ownership of the means of production, or else to restrict their purview or effects, in favor of common or cooperative ownership and management, viewing private property as a barrier to freedom and liberty. Classical libertarian ideologies include, but are not limited to, anarcho-communism (and anarcho-syndicalism), mutualism, egoism, and anti-paternalist, New Left schools of thought such as economic egalitarianism. In the United States, modern right-libertarian ideologies, such as minarchism and anarcho-capitalism, co-opted the term in the mid-20th century to instead advocate \"laissez-faire\" capitalism and strong private property rights, such as in land, infrastructure, and natural resources.\n\nThe first recorded use of the term \"libertarian\" was in 1789, when William Belsham wrote about libertarianism in the context of metaphysics.\n\n\"Libertarian\" came to mean an advocate or defender of liberty, especially in the political and social spheres, as early as 1796, when the London Packet printed on 12 February: \"Lately marched out of the Prison at Bristol, 450 of the French Libertarians\". The word was again used in a political sense in 1802 in a short piece critiquing a poem by \"the author of Gebir\" and has since been used with this meaning.\n\nThe use of the word \"libertarian\" to describe a new set of political positions has been traced to the French cognate, \"libertaire\", coined in a letter French libertarian communist Joseph Déjacque wrote to mutualist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in 1857. Déjacque also used the term for his anarchist publication \"Le Libertaire: Journal du Mouvement Social\", which was printed from 9 June 1858 to 4 February 1861 in New York City.\n\nIn the mid-1890s, Sébastien Faure began publishing a new \"Le Libertaire\" while France's Third Republic enacted the \"lois scélérates\" (\"villainous laws\"), which banned anarchist publications in France. \"Libertarianism\" has frequently been used as a synonym for anarchism since this time.\n\nThe term \"libertarianism\" was first used in the United States as a synonym for classical liberalism in May 1955 by writer Dean Russell, a colleague of Leonard Read and a classical liberal himself.\n\nHe justified the choice of the word as follows: \"Many of us call ourselves 'liberals.' And it is true that the word 'liberal' once described persons who respected the individual and feared the use of mass compulsions. But the leftists have now corrupted that once-proud term to identify themselves and their program of more government ownership of property and more controls over persons. As a result, those of us who believe in freedom must explain that when we call ourselves liberals, we mean liberals in the uncorrupted classical sense. At best, this is awkward and subject to misunderstanding. Here is a suggestion: Let those of us who love liberty trade-mark and reserve for our own use the good and honorable word 'libertarian'\".\n\nSubsequently, a growing number of Americans with classical liberal beliefs in the United States began to describe themselves as \"libertarian\". One person responsible for popularizing the term \"libertarian\" in this sense was Murray Rothbard, who started publishing libertarian works in the 1960s. Rothbard describes this modern use of the words overtly as a 'capture' from his enemies, saying that \"...for the first time in my memory, we, 'our side,' had captured a crucial word from the enemy... 'Libertarians'... had long been simply a polite word for left-wing anarchists, that is for anti-private property anarchists, either of the communist or syndicalist variety. But now we had taken it over...\"\n\nLibertarianism in the United States has been described as conservative on economic issues and liberal on personal freedom (for common meanings of conservative and liberal in the United States) and it is also often associated with a foreign policy of non-interventionism.\n\nThere is contention about whether left and right libertarianism \"represent distinct ideologies as opposed to variations on a theme\". All libertarians begin with a conception of personal autonomy from which they argue in favor of civil liberties and a reduction or elimination of the state.\n\nLeft-libertarianism encompasses those libertarian beliefs that claim the Earth's natural resources belong to everyone in an egalitarian manner, either unowned or owned collectively. Contemporary left-libertarians such as Hillel Steiner, Peter Vallentyne, Philippe Van Parijs, Michael Otsuka and David Ellerman believe the appropriation of land must leave \"enough and as good\" for others or be taxed by society to compensate for the exclusionary effects of private property. Libertarian socialists (social and individualist anarchists, libertarian Marxists, council communists, Luxemburgists and DeLeonists) promote usufruct and socialist economic theories, including communism, collectivism, syndicalism and mutualism. They criticize the state for being the defender of private property and believe capitalism entails wage slavery.\n\nRight-libertarianism developed in the United States in the mid-20th century and is the most popular conception of libertarianism in that region. It is commonly referred to as a continuation or radicalization of classical liberalism. Right-libertarians, while often sharing left-libertarians' advocacy for social freedom, also value the social institutions that enforce conditions of capitalism, while rejecting institutions that function in opposition to these on the grounds that such interventions represent unnecessary coercion of individuals and abrogation of their economic freedom. Anarcho-capitalists seek complete elimination of the state in favor of privately funded security services while minarchists defend \"night-watchman states\", which maintain only those functions of government necessary to maintain conditions of capitalism and personal security.\n\nAnarchism envisages freedom as a form of autonomy, which Paul Goodman describes as \"the ability to initiate a task and do it one's own way, without orders from authorities who do not know the actual problem and the available means\". All anarchists oppose political and legal authority, but collectivist strains also oppose the economic authority of private property. These social anarchists emphasize mutual aid, whereas individualist anarchists extol individual sovereignty.\n\nSome right-libertarians consider the non-aggression principle (NAP) to be a core part of their beliefs.\n\nLibertarians have been advocates and activists of civil liberties, including free love and free thought. Advocates of free love viewed sexual freedom as a clear, direct expression of individual sovereignty and they particularly stressed women's rights as most sexual laws discriminated against women: for example, marriage laws and anti-birth control measures.\n\nFree love appeared alongside anarcha-feminism and advocacy of LGBT rights. Anarcha-feminism developed as a synthesis of radical feminism and anarchism and views patriarchy as a fundamental manifestation of compulsory government. It was inspired by the late-19th-century writings of early feminist anarchists such as Lucy Parsons, Emma Goldman, Voltairine de Cleyre and Virginia Bolten.\n\nAnarcha-feminists, like other radical feminists, criticize and advocate the abolition of traditional conceptions of family, education and gender roles. \"Free Society\" (1895–1897 as \"The Firebrand\", 1897–1904 as \"Free Society\") was an anarchist newspaper in the United States that staunchly advocated free love and women's rights, while criticizing \"comstockery\", the censorship of sexual information. In recent times, anarchism has also voiced opinions and taken action around certain sex-related subjects such as pornography, BDSM and the sex industry.\n\nFree thought is a philosophical viewpoint that holds opinions should be formed on the basis of science, logic and reason in contrast with authority, tradition or other dogmas. In the United States, free thought was an anti-Christian, anti-clerical movement whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide on religious matters. A number of contributors to \"Liberty\" were prominent figures in both free thought and anarchism.\n\nIn 1901, Catalan anarchist and free-thinker Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia established \"modern\" or progressive schools in Barcelona in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church. Fiercely anti-clerical, Ferrer believed in \"freedom in education\", i.e. education free from the authority of the church and state. The schools' stated goal was to \"educate the working class in a rational, secular and non-coercive setting\".\n\nLater in the 20th century, Austrian Freudo-Marxist Wilhelm Reich became a consistent propagandist for sexual freedom going as far as opening free sex-counseling clinics in Vienna for working-class patients as well as coining the phrase \"sexual revolution\" in one of his books from the 1940s. During the early 1970s, the English anarchist and pacifist Alex Comfort achieved international celebrity for writing the sex manuals \"The Joy of Sex\" and \"More Joy of Sex\".\n\nMany left-libertarians are anarchists and believe the state inherently violates personal autonomy: \"As Robert Paul Wolff has argued, since 'the state is authority, the right to rule', anarchism which rejects the State is the only political doctrine consistent with autonomy in which the individual alone is the judge of his moral constraints\". Social anarchists believe the state defends private property, which they view as intrinsically harmful, while market-oriented left-libertarians argue that so-called free markets actually consist of economic privileges granted by the state. These latter libertarians advocate instead for freed markets, which are freed from these privileges.\n\nThere is a debate amongst right-libertarians as to whether or not the state is legitimate: while anarcho-capitalists advocate its abolition, minarchists support minimal states, often referred to as night-watchman states. Libertarians take a skeptical view of government authority. Minarchists maintain that the state is necessary for the protection of individuals from aggression, theft, breach of contract and fraud. They believe the only legitimate governmental institutions are the military, police and courts, though some expand this list to include fire departments, prisons and the executive and legislative branches.\n\nThey justify the state on the grounds that it is the logical consequence of adhering to the non-aggression principle and argue that anarchism is immoral because it implies that the non-aggression principle is optional, that the enforcement of laws under anarchism is open to competition. Another common justification is that private defense agencies and court firms would tend to represent the interests of those who pay them enough.\n\nAnarcho-capitalists argue that the state violates the non-aggression principle (NAP) by its nature because governments use force against those who have not stolen or vandalized private property, assaulted anyone or committed fraud. Linda & Morris Tannehill argue that no coercive monopoly of force can arise on a truly free market and that a government's citizenry can not desert them in favor of a competent protection and defense agency.\n\nLeft-libertarians believe that neither claiming nor mixing one's labor with natural resources is enough to generate full private property rights and maintain that natural resources ought to be held in an egalitarian manner, either unowned or owned collectively.\n\nRight-libertarians maintain that unowned natural resources \"may be appropriated by the first person who discovers them, mixes his labor with them, or merely claims them—without the consent of others, and with little or no payment to them\". They believe that natural resources are originally unowned and therefore private parties may appropriate them at will without the consent of, or owing to, others.\n\nLeft-libertarians (social and individualist anarchists, libertarian Marxists and left-wing market anarchists) argue in favor of socialist theories such as communism, syndicalism and mutualism (anarchist economics). Daniel Guérin writes that \"anarchism is really a synonym for socialism. The anarchist is primarily a socialist whose aim is to abolish the exploitation of man by man. Anarchism is only one of the streams of socialist thought, that stream whose main components are concern for liberty and haste to abolish the State\".\n\nRight-libertarians are economic liberals of either the Austrian School or Chicago school and support \"laissez-faire\" capitalism.\n\nWage labor has long been compared by socialists and anarcho-syndicalists to slavery. As a result, the term \"wage slavery\" is often utilized as a pejorative for wage labor. Advocates of slavery looked upon the \"comparative evils of Slave Society and of Free Society, of slavery to human Masters and slavery to Capital\" and proceeded to argue that wage slavery was actually \"worse\" than chattel slavery. Slavery apologists like George Fitzhugh contended that workers only accepted wage labor with the passage of time, as they became \"familiarized and inattentive to the infected social atmosphere they continually inhale[d]\".\n\nAccording to Noam Chomsky, analysis of the psychological implications of wage slavery goes back to the Enlightenment era. In his 1791 book \"On the Limits of State Action\", classical liberal thinker Wilhelm von Humboldt explained how \"whatever does not spring from a man's free choice, or is only the result of instruction and guidance, does not enter into his very nature; he does not perform it with truly human energies, but merely with mechanical exactness\" and so when the laborer works under external control \"we may admire what he does, but we despise what he is\".\n\nFor Marxists, labour-as-commodity, which is how they regard wage labor, provides an absolutely fundamental point of attack against capitalism. \"It can be persuasively argued\", noted philosopher John Nelson, \"that the conception of the worker's labor as a commodity confirms Marx's stigmatization of the wage system of private capitalism as 'wage-slavery;' that is, as an instrument of the capitalist's for reducing the worker's condition to that of a slave, if not below it\".\n\nThat this objection is fundamental follows immediately from Marx's conclusion that wage labor is the very foundation of capitalism: \"Without a class dependent on wages, the moment individuals confront each other as free persons, there can be no production of surplus value; without the production of surplus-value there can be no capitalist production, and hence no capital and no capitalist!\".\n\nLeft-libertarianism (or classical libertarianism) names several related, but distinct approaches to political and social theory which stresses both individual freedom and social equality. In its classical usage, left-libertarianism is a synonym for anti-authoritarian varieties of left-wing politics, i.e. libertarian socialism, which includes anarchism and libertarian Marxism, among others. Left-libertarianism can also refer to political positions associated with academic philosophers Hillel Steiner, Philippe Van Parijs and Peter Vallentyne that combine self-ownership with an egalitarian approach to natural resources.\n\nWhile maintaining full respect for personal property, left-libertarians are skeptical of or fully against private property, arguing that neither claiming nor mixing one's labor with natural resources is enough to generate full private property rights and maintain that natural resources (land, oil, gold and vegetation) should be held in an egalitarian manner, either unowned or owned collectively. Those left-libertarians who support private property do so under the condition that recompense is offered to the local community. Many left-libertarian schools of thought are communist, advocating the eventual replacement of money with labor vouchers or decentralized planning.\n\nOn the other hand, left-wing market anarchism, which includes Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's mutualism and Samuel Edward Konkin III's agorism, appeals to left-wing concerns such as egalitarianism, gender and sexuality, class, immigration and environmentalism within the paradigm of a socialist free market. Joseph Déjacque was the first to formulate classical libertarian ideas under the term \"libertarian.\" Later philosophers on the left would go onto adding detail to his political philosophy, to study and document attitudes and themes relating to stateless socialism (for Déjacque, libertarian communism).\n\nRight-libertarianism (or right-wing libertarianism) refers to libertarian political philosophies that advocate negative rights, natural law and a major reversal of the modern welfare state. Right-libertarians strongly support private property rights and defend market distribution of natural resources and private property. This position is contrasted with that of some versions of left-libertarianism, which maintain that natural resources belong to everyone in an egalitarian manner, either unowned or owned collectively. Right-libertarianism includes anarcho-capitalism and \"laissez-faire\", minarchist liberalism.\n\nElements of libertarianism can be traced as far back as the ancient Chinese philosopher Lao-Tzu and the higher-law concepts of the Greeks and the Israelites. In 17th-century England, libertarian ideas began to take modern form in the writings of the Levellers and John Locke. In the middle of that century, opponents of royal power began to be called Whigs, or sometimes simply \"opposition\" or \"country\" (as opposed to Court) writers.\n\nDuring the 18th century, classical liberal ideas flourished in Europe and North America. Libertarians of various schools were influenced by classical liberal ideas. For libertarian philosopher Roderick T. Long, both libertarian socialists and libertarian capitalists \"share a common—or at least an overlapping intellectual ancestry—... both claim the seventeenth century English Levellers and the eighteenth century French encyclopedists among their ideological forebears; and (also)... usually share an admiration for Thomas Jefferson and Thomas Paine\".\nJohn Locke greatly influenced both libertarianism and the modern world in his writings published before and after the English Revolution of 1688, especially \"A Letter Concerning Toleration\" (1667), \"Two Treatises of Government\" (1689) and \"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\" (1690). In the text of 1689, he established the basis of liberal political theory: that people's rights existed before government; that the purpose of government is to protect personal and property rights; that people may dissolve governments that do not do so; and that representative government is the best form to protect rights.\n\nThe United States Declaration of Independence was inspired by Locke in its statement: \"[T]o secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it\". Nevertheless scholar Ellen Meiksins Wood says that \"there are doctrines of individualism that are opposed to Lockean individualism... and non-Lockean individualism may encompass socialism\".\n\nAccording to Murray Rothbard, the libertarian creed emerged from the classical liberal challenges to an \"absolute central State and a king ruling by divine right on top of an older, restrictive web of feudal land monopolies and urban guild controls and restrictions\", the mercantilism of a bureaucratic warfaring state allied with privileged merchants. The object of classical liberals was individual liberty in the economy, in personal freedoms and civil liberty, separation of state and religion, and peace as an alternative to imperial aggrandizement. He cites Locke's contemporaries, the Levellers, who held similar views. Also influential were the English \"Cato's Letters\" during the early 1700s, reprinted eagerly by American colonists who already were free of European aristocracy and feudal land monopolies.\n\nIn January 1776, only two years after coming to America from England, Thomas Paine published his pamphlet \"Common Sense\" calling for independence for the colonies. Paine promoted classical liberal ideas in clear, concise language that allowed the general public to understand the debates among the political elites. \"Common Sense\" was immensely popular in disseminating these ideas, selling hundreds of thousands of copies. Paine later would write the \"Rights of Man\" and \"The Age of Reason\" and participate in the French Revolution. Paine's theory of property showed a \"libertarian concern\" with the redistribution of resources.\n\nIn 1793, William Godwin wrote a libertarian philosophical treatise, \"Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and its Influence on Morals and Happiness\", which criticized ideas of human rights and of society by contract based on vague promises. He took classical liberalism to its logical anarchic conclusion by rejecting all political institutions, law, government and apparatus of coercion as well as all political protest and insurrection. Instead of institutionalized justice, Godwin proposed that people influence one another to moral goodness through informal reasoned persuasion, including in the associations they joined as this would facilitate happiness.\n\nModern anarchism sprang from the secular or religious thought of the Enlightenment, particularly Jean-Jacques Rousseau's arguments for the moral centrality of freedom.\n\nAs part of the political turmoil of the 1790s in the wake of the French Revolution, William Godwin developed the first expression of modern anarchist thought. According to Peter Kropotkin, Godwin was \"the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work\", while Godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early Edmund Burke.\n\nGodwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as philosophical anarchism. He argued in \"Political Justice\" (1793) that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance. He thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force. Although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy, he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power. Rather, Godwin advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution.\n\nHis aversion to the imposition of a rules-based society led him to denounce, as a manifestation of the people's \"mental enslavement\", the foundations of law, property rights and even the institution of marriage. Godwin considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organization. In each case, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgment.\n\nIn France, various anarchist currents were present during the Revolutionary period, with some revolutionaries using the term \"anarchiste\" in a positive light as early as September 1793. The \"enragés\" opposed revolutionary government as a contradiction in terms. Denouncing the Jacobin dictatorship, Jean Varlet wrote in 1794 that \"government and revolution are incompatible, unless the people wishes to set its constituted authorities in permanent insurrection against itself\". In his \"Manifesto of the Equals\", Sylvain Maréchal looked forward to the disappearance, once and for all, of \"the revolting distinction between rich and poor, of great and small, of masters and valets, of governors and governed\".\n\nLibertarian socialism, libertarian communism and libertarian Marxism are all phrases which activists with a variety of perspectives have applied to their views.\n\nAnarchist communist philosopher Joseph Déjacque was the first person to describe himself as a libertarian. Unlike mutualist anarchist philosopher Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, he argued that \"it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature\".\n\nAccording to anarchist historian Max Nettlau, the first use of the term \"libertarian communism\" was in November 1880, when a French anarchist congress employed it to more clearly identify its doctrines. The French anarchist journalist Sébastien Faure started the weekly paper \"Le Libertaire\" (\"The Libertarian\") in 1895.\n\nIndividualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants such as groups, society, traditions, and ideological systems. An influential form of individualist anarchism called egoism or egoist anarchism was expounded by one of the earliest and best-known proponents of individualist anarchism, the German Max Stirner. Stirner's \"The Ego and Its Own\", published in 1844, is a founding text of the philosophy. According to Stirner, the only limitation on the rights of the individual is their power to obtain what they desire, without regard for God, state or morality.\n\nStirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw unions of egoists, non-systematic associations continually renewed by all parties' support through an act of will, which Stirner proposed as a form of organisation in place of the state. Egoist anarchists argue that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals. Egoism has inspired many interpretations of Stirner's philosophy.\n\nIt was re-discovered and promoted by German philosophical anarchist and LGBT activist John Henry Mackay. Josiah Warren is widely regarded as the first American anarchist, and the four-page weekly paper he edited during 1833, \"The Peaceful Revolutionist\", was the first anarchist periodical published. For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster, \"[i]t is apparent... that Proudhonian Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of Josiah Warren and Stephen Pearl Andrews... William B. Greene presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form.\".\n\nLater, Benjamin Tucker fused Stirner's egoism with the economics of Warren and Proudhon in his eclectic influential publication \"Liberty\". From these early influences, individualist anarchism in different countries attracted a small yet diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals, free love and birth control advocates (anarchism and issues related to love and sex), individualist naturists nudists (anarcho-naturism), free thought and anti-clerical activists as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation (European individualist anarchism and individualist anarchism in France). These authors and activists included Emile Armand, Han Ryner, Henri Zisly, Renzo Novatore, Miguel Gimenez Igualada, Adolf Brand and Lev Chernyi.\nIn 1873, the follower and translator of Proudhon, the Catalan Francesc Pi i Margall, became President of Spain with a program which wanted \"to establish a decentralized, or \"cantonalist,\" political system on Proudhonian lines\", who according to Rudolf Rocker had \"political ideas...much in common with those of Richard Price, Joseph Priestly [\"sic\"], Thomas Paine, Jefferson, and other representatives of the Anglo-American liberalism of the first period. He wanted to limit the power of the state to a minimum and gradually replace it by a Socialist economic order\".\n\nOn the other hand, Fermín Salvochea was a mayor of the city of Cádiz and a president of the province of Cádiz. He was one of the main propagators of anarchist thought in that area in the late 19th century and is considered to be \"perhaps the most beloved figure in the Spanish Anarchist movement of the 19th century\". Ideologically, he was influenced by Bradlaugh, Owen and Paine, whose works he had studied during his stay in England and Kropotkin, whom he read later. The revolutionary wave of 1917–1923 saw the active participation of anarchists in Russia and Europe. Russian anarchists participated alongside the Bolsheviks in both the February and October 1917 revolutions.\n\nHowever, Bolsheviks in central Russia quickly began to imprison or drive underground the libertarian anarchists. Many fled to the Ukraine. There, in the Ukrainian Free Territory they fought in the Russian Civil War against the White movement, monarchists and other opponents of revolution and then against Bolsheviks as part of the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine led by Nestor Makhno, who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months. Expelled American anarchists Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman protested Bolshevik policy before they left Russia.\n\nThe victory of the Bolsheviks damaged anarchist movements internationally as workers and activists joined Communist parties. In France and the United States, for example, members of the major syndicalist movements of the CGT and IWW joined the Communist International. In Paris, the Dielo Truda group of Russian anarchist exiles, which included Nestor Makhno, issued a 1926 manifesto, the \"Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)\", calling for new anarchist organizing structures.\n\nThe Bavarian Soviet Republic of 1918–1919 had libertarian socialist characteristics. In Italy, from 1918 to 1921 the anarcho-syndicalist trade union Unione Sindacale Italiana grew to 800,000 members.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, with the rise of fascism in Europe, anarchists began to fight fascists in Italy, in France during the February 1934 riots and in Spain where the CNT (Confederación Nacional del Trabajo) boycott of elections led to a right-wing victory and its later participation in voting in 1936 helped bring the popular front back to power. This led to a ruling class attempted coup and the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939). Gruppo Comunista Anarchico di Firenze held that the during early twentieth century, the terms libertarian communism and anarchist communism became synonymous within the international anarchist movement as a result of the close connection they had in Spain (anarchism in Spain) (with libertarian communism becoming the prevalent term).\n\nMurray Bookchin wrote that the Spanish libertarian movement of the mid-1930s was unique because its workers' control and collectives—which came out of a three-generation \"massive libertarian movement\"—divided the republican camp and challenged the Marxists. \"Urban anarchists\" created libertarian communist forms of organization which evolved into the CNT, a syndicalist union providing the infrastructure for a libertarian society. Also formed were local bodies to administer social and economic life on a decentralized libertarian basis. Much of the infrastructure was destroyed during the 1930s Spanish Civil War against authoritarian and fascist forces.\n\nThe Iberian Federation of Libertarian Youth (FIJL, Spanish: \"Federación Ibérica de Juventudes Libertarias\"), sometimes abbreviated as \"Libertarian Youth\" (\"Juventudes Libertarias\"), was a libertarian socialist organization created in 1932 in Madrid.\n\nIn February 1937, the FIJL organized a plenum of regional organizations (second congress of FIJL). In October 1938, from the 16th through the 30th in Barcelona the FIJL participated in a national plenum of the libertarian movement, also attended by members of the CNT and the Iberian Anarchist Federation (FAI). The FIJL exists until today. When the republican forces lost the Spanish Civil War, the city of Madrid was turned over to the Francoist forces in 1939 by the last non-Francoist mayor of the city, the anarchist Melchor Rodríguez García. During autumn of 1931, the \"Manifesto of the 30\" was published by militants of the anarchist trade union CNT and among those who signed it there was the CNT General Secretary (1922–1923) Joan Peiro, Angel Pestaña CNT (General Secretary in 1929) and Juan Lopez Sanchez.\n\nThey were called \"treintismo\" and they were calling for \"libertarian possibilism\" which advocated achieving libertarian socialist ends with participation inside structures of contemporary parliamentary democracy. In 1932, they establish the Syndicalist Party which participates in the 1936 Spanish general elections and proceed to be a part of the leftist coalition of parties known as the Popular Front obtaining 2 congressmen (Pestaña and Benito Pabon). In 1938, Horacio Prieto, general secretary of the CNT, proposes that the Iberian Anarchist Federation transforms itself into a \"Libertarian Socialist Party\" and that it participates in the national elections.\nThe \"Manifesto of Libertarian Communism\" was written in 1953 by Georges Fontenis for the \"Federation Communiste Libertaire\" of France. It is one of the key texts of the anarchist-communist current known as platformism. In 1968, in Carrara, Italy the International of Anarchist Federations was founded during an international anarchist conference to advance libertarian solidarity.\n\nIt wanted to form \"a strong and organized workers movement, agreeing with the libertarian ideas\". In the United States, the Libertarian League was founded in New York City in 1954 as a left-libertarian political organization building on the Libertarian Book Club. Members included Sam Dolgoff, Russell Blackwell, Dave Van Ronk, Enrico Arrigoni and Murray Bookchin.\n\nIn Australia, the Sydney Push was a predominantly left-wing intellectual subculture in Sydney from the late 1940s to the early 1970s which became associated with the label \"Sydney libertarianism\". Well known associates of the Push include Jim Baker, John Flaus, Harry Hooton, Margaret Fink, Sasha Soldatow, Lex Banning, Eva Cox, Richard Appleton, Paddy McGuinness, David Makinson, Germaine Greer, Clive James, Robert Hughes, Frank Moorhouse and Lillian Roxon.\n\nAmongst the key intellectual figures in Push debates were philosophers David J. Ivison, George Molnar, Roelof Smilde, Darcy Waters and Jim Baker, as recorded in Baker's memoir \"Sydney Libertarians and the Push\", published in the libertarian \"Broadsheet\" in 1975. An understanding of libertarian values and social theory can be obtained from their publications, a few of which are available online.\n\nIn 1969, French platformist anarcho-communist Daniel Guérin published an essay in 1969 called \"Libertarian Marxism?\" in which he dealt with the debate between Karl Marx and Mikhail Bakunin at the First International and afterwards suggested that \"[L]ibertarian Marxism rejects determinism and fatalism, giving the greater place to individual will, intuition, imagination, reflex speeds, and to the deep instincts of the masses, which are more far-seeing in hours of crisis than the reasonings of the 'elites'; libertarian Marxism thinks of the effects of surprise, provocation and boldness, refuses to be cluttered and paralyzed by a heavy 'scientific' apparatus, doesn't equivocate or bluff, and guards itself from adventurism as much as from fear of the unknown\".\n\nLibertarian Marxist currents often draw from Marx and Engels' later works, specifically the \"Grundrisse\" and \"The Civil War in France\". They emphasize the Marxist belief in the ability of the working class to forge its own destiny without the need for a revolutionary party or state. Libertarian Marxism includes such currents as council communism, left communism, Socialisme ou Barbarie, Lettrism/Situationism and operaismo/autonomism and New Left.\n\nIn the United States, from 1970 to 1981 there existed the publication \"Root & Branch\" which had as a subtitle \"A Libertarian Marxist Journal\". In 1974, the \"Libertarian Communism\" journal was started in the United Kingdom by a group inside the Socialist Party of Great Britain. In 1986, the anarcho-syndicalist Sam Dolgoff started and led the publication \"Libertarian Labor Review\" in the United States which decided to rename itself as \"Anarcho-Syndicalist Review\" in order to avoid confusion with right-libertarian views.\n\nThe indigenous anarchist tradition in the United States was largely individualist. In 1825, Josiah Warren became aware of the social system of utopian socialist Robert Owen and began to talk with others in Cincinnati about founding a communist colony.\n\nWhen this group failed to come to an agreement about the form and goals of their proposed community, Warren \"sold his factory after only two years of operation, packed up his young family, and took his place as one of 900 or so Owenites who had decided to become part of the founding population of New Harmony, Indiana\". Warren termed the phrase \"cost the limit of price\" and \"proposed a system to pay people with certificates indicating how many hours of work they did. They could exchange the notes at local time stores for goods that took the same amount of time to produce\". He put his theories to the test by establishing an experimental labor-for-labor store called the Cincinnati Time Store where trade was facilitated by labor notes.\n\nThe store proved successful and operated for three years, after which it was closed so that Warren could pursue establishing colonies based on mutualism, including Utopia and Modern Times. \"After New Harmony failed, Warren shifted his ideological loyalties from socialism to anarchism (which was no great leap, given that Owen's socialism had been predicated on Godwin's anarchism)\". Warren is widely regarded as the first American anarchist and the four-page weekly paper \"The Peaceful Revolutionist\" he edited during 1833 was the first anarchist periodical published, an enterprise for which he built his own printing press, cast his own type and made his own printing plates.\n\nCatalan historian Xavier Diez reports that the intentional communal experiments pioneered by Warren were influential in European individualist anarchists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries such as Émile Armand and the intentional communities started by them. Warren said that Stephen Pearl Andrews, individualist anarchist and close associate, wrote the most lucid and complete exposition of Warren's own theories in \"The Science of Society\", published in 1852. Andrews was formerly associated with the Fourierist movement, but converted to radical individualism after becoming acquainted with the work of Warren. Like Warren, he held the principle of \"individual sovereignty\" as being of paramount importance. Contemporary American anarchist Hakim Bey reports: \n\nFor American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster, \"[it is apparent... that Proudhonian Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of Josiah Warren and Stephen Pearl Andrews. William B. Greene presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form\". William Batchelder Greene was a 19th-century mutualist individualist anarchist, Unitarian minister, soldier and promoter of free banking in the United States. Greene is best known for the works \"Mutual Banking\", which proposed an interest-free banking system; and \"Transcendentalism\", a critique of the New England philosophical school.\n\nAfter 1850, he became active in labor reform. \"He was elected vice-president of the New England Labor Reform League, the majority of the members holding to Proudhon's scheme of mutual banking, and in 1869 president of the Massachusetts Labor Union\". Greene then published \"Socialistic, Mutualistic, and Financial Fragments\" (1875). He saw mutualism as the synthesis of \"liberty and order\". His \"associationism... is checked by individualism... 'Mind your own business,' 'Judge not that ye be not judged.' Over matters which are purely personal, as for example, moral conduct, the individual is sovereign, as well as over that which he himself produces. For this reason he demands 'mutuality' in marriage—the equal right of a woman to her own personal freedom and property\".\n\nPoet, naturalist and transcendentalist Henry David Thoreau was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the United States and Europe. He is best known for his book \"Walden\", a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings; and his essay \"Civil Disobedience\" (\"Resistance to Civil Government\"), an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. In \"Walden\", Thoreau advocates simple living and self-sufficiency among natural surroundings in resistance to the advancement of industrial civilization.\n\n\"Civil Disobedience\", first published in 1849, argues that people should not permit governments to overrule or atrophy their consciences and that people have a duty to avoid allowing such acquiescence to enable the government to make them the agents of injustice. These works influenced green anarchism, anarcho-primitivism and anarcho-pacifism, as well as figures including Mohandas Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr., Martin Buber and Leo Tolstoy. \"Many have seen in Thoreau one of the precursors of ecologism and anarcho-primitivism represented today in John Zerzan.\n\nFor George Woodcock this attitude can be also motivated by certain idea of resistance to progress and of rejection of the growing materialism which is the nature of American society in the mid-19th century\". Zerzan included Thoreau's \"Excursions\" in his edited compilation of anti-civilization writings, \"\". Individualist anarchists such as Thoreau do not speak of economics, but simply the right of disunion from the state and foresee the gradual elimination of the state through social evolution. Agorist author J. Neil Schulman cites Thoreau as a primary inspiration.\n\nMany economists since Adam Smith have argued that—unlike other taxes—a land value tax would not cause economic inefficiency. It would be a progressive tax—primarily paid by the wealthy—and increase wages, reduce economic inequality, remove incentives to misuse real estate and reduce the vulnerability that economies face from credit and property bubbles.\n\nEarly proponents of this view include Thomas Paine, Herbert Spencer, and Hugo Grotius, but the concept was widely popularized by the economist and social reformer Henry George. George believed that people ought to own the fruits of their labor and the value of the improvements they make, thus he was opposed to income taxes, sales taxes, taxes on improvements and all other taxes on production, labor, trade or commerce.\n\nGeorge was among the staunchest defenders of free markets and his book \"Protection or Free Trade\" was read into the U.S. Congressional Record. Yet he did support direct management of natural monopolies as a last resort, such as right-of-way monopolies necessary for railroads. George advocated for elimination of intellectual property arrangements in favor of government sponsored prizes for inventors.\n\nEarly followers of George's philosophy called themselves single taxers because they believed that the only legitimate, broad-based tax was land rent. The term Georgism was coined later, though some modern proponents prefer the term Geoism instead, leaving the meaning of \"geo\" (Earth in Greek) deliberately ambiguous. The terms \"Earth Sharing\", \"geonomics\" and \"geolibertarianism\" are used by some Georgists to represent a difference of emphasis, or real differences about how land rent should be spent, but all agree that land rent should be recovered from its private owners.\nIndividualist anarchism found in the United States an important space for discussion and development within the group known as the \"Boston anarchists\". Even among the 19th-century American individualists there was no monolithic doctrine and they disagreed amongst each other on various issues including intellectual property rights and possession versus property in land. Some Boston anarchists, including Benjamin Tucker, identified as socialists, which in the 19th century was often used in the sense of a commitment to improving conditions of the working class (i.e. \"the labor problem\").\n\nLysander Spooner, besides his individualist anarchist activism, was also an anti-slavery activist and member of the First International. Tucker argued that the elimination of what he called \"the four monopolies\"—the land monopoly, the money and banking monopoly, the monopoly powers conferred by patents and the quasi-monopolistic effects of tariffs—would undermine the power of the wealthy and big business, making possible widespread property ownership and higher incomes for ordinary people, while minimizing the power of would-be bosses and achieving socialist goals without state action. Tucker's anarchist periodical, \"Liberty\", was published from August 1881 to April 1908.\n\nThe publication, emblazoned with Proudhon's quote that liberty is \"Not the Daughter But the Mother of Order\" was instrumental in developing and formalizing the individualist anarchist philosophy through publishing essays and serving as a forum for debate. Contributors included Benjamin Tucker, Lysander Spooner, Auberon Herbert, Dyer Lum, Joshua K. Ingalls, John Henry Mackay, Victor Yarros, Wordsworth Donisthorpe, James L. Walker, J. William Lloyd, Florence Finch Kelly, Voltairine de Cleyre, Steven T. Byington, John Beverley Robinson, Jo Labadie, Lillian Harman and Henry Appleton. Later, Tucker and others abandoned their traditional support of natural rights and converted to an egoism modeled upon the philosophy of Max Stirner.\n\nA number of natural rights proponents stopped contributing in protest and \"[t]hereafter, \"Liberty\" championed egoism, although its general content did not change significantly\". Several publications \"were undoubtedly influenced by \"Liberty\"s presentation of egoism. They included: \"I\" published by C.L. Swartz, edited by W.E. Gordak and J.W. Lloyd (all associates of \"Liberty\"); \"The Ego\" and \"The Egoist\", both of which were edited by Edward H. Fulton. Among the egoist papers that Tucker followed were the German \"Der Eigene\", edited by Adolf Brand, and \"The Eagle\" and \"The Serpent\", issued from London. The latter, the most prominent English-language egoist journal, was published from 1898 to 1900 with the subtitle 'A Journal of Egoistic Philosophy and Sociology'\".\n\nBy around the start of the 20th century, the heyday of individualist anarchism had passed. H. L. Mencken and Albert Jay Nock were the first prominent figures in the United States to describe themselves as libertarians; they believed Franklin D. Roosevelt had co-opted the word \"liberal\" for his New Deal policies which they opposed and used \"libertarian\" to signify their allegiance to individualism. In 1914, Nock joined the staff of \"The Nation\" magazine, which at the time was supportive of liberal capitalism.\n\nA lifelong admirer of Henry George, Nock went on to become co-editor of \"The Freeman\" from 1920 to 1924, a publication initially conceived as a vehicle for the single tax movement, financed by the wealthy wife of the magazine's other editor, Francis Neilson. Critic H.L. Mencken wrote that \"[h]is editorials during the three brief years of the \"Freeman\" set a mark that no other man of his trade has ever quite managed to reach. They were well-informed and sometimes even learned, but there was never the slightest trace of pedantry in them\".\n\nExecutive Vice President of the Cato Institute, David Boaz, writes: \"In 1943, at one of the lowest points for liberty and humanity in history, three remarkable women published books that could be said to have given birth to the modern libertarian movement\". Isabel Paterson's \"The God of the Machine\", Rose Wilder Lane's \"The Discovery of Freedom\" and Ayn Rand's \"The Fountainhead\" each promoted individualism and capitalism. None of the three used the term libertarianism to describe their beliefs and Rand specifically rejected the label, criticizing the burgeoning American libertarian movement as the \"hippies of the right\". Rand's own philosophy, Objectivism, is notedly similar to libertarianism and she accused libertarians of plagiarizing her ideas. Rand stated: \n\nIn 1946, Leonard E. Read founded the Foundation for Economic Education (FEE), an American nonprofit educational organization which promotes the principles of laissez-faire economics, private property, and limited government. According to Gary North, former FEE director of seminars and a current Ludwig von Mises Institute scholar, FEE is the \"granddaddy of all libertarian organizations\". The initial officers of FEE were Leonard E. Read as President, Austrian School economist Henry Hazlitt as Vice-President and Chairman David Goodrich of B. F. Goodrich. Other trustees on the FEE board have included wealthy industrialist Jasper Crane of DuPont, H. W. Luhnow of William Volker & Co. and Robert Welch, founder of the John Birch Society.\n\nAustrian school economist Murray Rothbard was initially an enthusiastic partisan of the Old Right, particularly because of its general opposition to war and imperialism, but long embraced a reading of American history that emphasized the role of elite privilege in shaping legal and political institutions. He was part of Ayn Rand's circle for a brief period, but later harshly criticized Objectivism. He praised Rand's \"Atlas Shrugged\" and wrote that she \"introduced me to the whole field of natural rights and natural law philosophy\", prompting him to learn \"the glorious natural rights tradition\". He soon broke with Rand over various differences, including his defense of anarchism. Rothbard was influenced by the work of the 19th-century American individualist anarchists and sought to meld their advocacy of free markets and private defense with the principles of Austrian economics. This new philosophy he called anarcho-capitalism.\n\nKarl Hess, a speechwriter for Barry Goldwater and primary author of the Republican Party's 1960 and 1964 platforms, became disillusioned with traditional politics following the 1964 presidential campaign in which Goldwater lost to Lyndon B. Johnson. He parted with the Republicans altogether after being rejected for employment with the party, and began work as a heavy-duty welder. Hess began reading American anarchists largely due to the recommendations of his friend Murray Rothbard and said that upon reading the works of communist anarchist Emma Goldman, he discovered that anarchists believed everything he had hoped the Republican Party would represent. For Hess, Goldman was the source for the best and most essential theories of Ayn Rand without any of the \"crazy solipsism that Rand was so fond of\". Hess and Rothbard founded the journal \"\", which was published from 1965 to 1968, with George Resch and Leonard P. Liggio. In 1969, they edited \"The Libertarian Forum\" 1969, which Hess left in 1971. Hess eventually put his focus on the small scale, stating that \"Society is: people together making culture\". He deemed two of his cardinal social principles to be \"opposition to central political authority\" and \"concern for people as individuals\". His rejection of standard American party politics was reflected in a lecture he gave during which he said: \"The Democrats or liberals think that everybody is stupid and therefore they need somebody... to tell them how to behave themselves. The Republicans think everybody is lazy\".\nThe Vietnam War split the uneasy alliance between growing numbers of American libertarians and conservatives who believed in limiting liberty to uphold moral virtues. Libertarians opposed to the war joined the draft resistance and peace movements, as well as organizations such as Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). In 1969 and 1970, Hess joined with others, including Murray Rothbard, Robert LeFevre, Dana Rohrabacher, Samuel Edward Konkin III and former SDS leader Carl Oglesby to speak at two \"left-right\" conferences which brought together activists from both the Old Right and the New Left in what was emerging as a nascent libertarian movement. As part of his effort to unite right and left-libertarianism, Hess would join the SDS as well as the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), of which he explained: \"We used to have a labor movement in this country, until I.W.W. leaders were killed or imprisoned. You could tell labor unions had become captive when business and government began to praise them. They're destroying the militant black leaders the same way now. If the slaughter continues, before long liberals will be asking, 'What happened to the blacks? Why aren't they militant anymore?'\". Rothbard ultimately broke with the left, allying himself instead with the burgeoning paleoconservative movement. He criticized the tendency of these left-libertarians to appeal to \"'free spirits,' to people who don't want to push other people around, and who don't want to be pushed around themselves\" in contrast to \"the bulk of Americans,\" who \"might well be tight-assed conformists, who want to stamp out drugs in their vicinity, kick out people with strange dress habits, etc\". This left-libertarian tradition has been carried to the present day by Samuel Edward Konkin III's agorists, contemporary mutualists such as Kevin Carson and Roderick T. Long and other left-wing market anarchists.\n\nIn 1971, a small group of Americans led by David Nolan formed the Libertarian Party, which has run a presidential candidate every election year since 1972. Other libertarian organizations, such as the Center for Libertarian Studies and the Cato Institute, were also formed in the 1970s. Philosopher John Hospers, a one-time member of Rand's inner circle, proposed a non-initiation of force principle to unite both groups, but this statement later became a required \"pledge\" for candidates of the Libertarian Party and Hospers became its first presidential candidate in 1972. In the 1980s, Hess joined the Libertarian Party and served as editor of its newspaper from 1986 to 1990.\n\nModern libertarianism gained significant recognition in academia with the publication of Harvard University professor Robert Nozick's \"Anarchy, State, and Utopia\" in 1974, for which he received a National Book Award in 1975. In response to John Rawls's \"A Theory of Justice\", Nozick's book supported a minimal state (also called a nightwatchman state by Nozick) on the grounds that the ultraminimal state arises without violating individual rights and the transition from an ultraminimal state to a minimal state is morally obligated to occur. Specifically, Nozick writes, \"We argue that the first transition from a system of private protective agencies to an ultraminimal state, will occur by an invisible-hand process in a morally permissible way that violates no one's rights. Secondly, we argue that the transition from an ultraminimal state to a minimal state morally must occur. It would be morally impermissible for persons to maintain the monopoly in the ultraminimal state without providing protective services for all, even if this requires specific 'redistribution.' The operators of the ultraminimal state are morally obligated to produce the minimal state.\"\n\nIn the early 1970s, Rothbard wrote that \"[o]ne gratifying aspect of our rise to some prominence is that, for the first time in my memory, we, 'our side,' had captured a crucial word from the enemy... 'Libertarians'... had long been simply a polite word for left-wing anarchists, that is for anti-private property anarchists, either of the communist or syndicalist variety. But now we had taken it over\". Indeed, the project of spreading libertarian ideals in the United States has been so successful that some Americans who don't identify as \"libertarian\" seem to hold libertarian views. Since the resurgence of neoliberalism in the 1970s, this modern American libertarianism has spread beyond North America via think tanks and political parties.\n\nA surge of popular interest in libertarian socialism occurred in western nations during the 1960s and 1970s. Anarchism was influential in the Counterculture of the 1960s and anarchists actively participated in the late sixties students and workers revolts. In 1968, the International of Anarchist Federations was founded in Carrara, Italy during an international anarchist conference held there in 1968 by the three existing European federations of France, the Italian and the Iberian Anarchist Federation as well as the Bulgarian federation in French exile. The uprisings of May 1968 also led to a small resurgence of interest in left communist ideas. Various small left communist groups emerged around the world, predominantly in the leading capitalist countries. A series of conferences of the communist left began in 1976, with the aim of promoting international and cross-tendency discussion, but these petered out in the 1980s without having increased the profile of the movement or its unity of ideas. Left communist groups existing today include the International Communist Party, International Communist Current and the Internationalist Communist Tendency. The housing and employment crisis in most of Western Europe led to the formation of communes and squatter movements like that of Barcelona, Spain. In Denmark, squatters occupied a disused military base and declared the Freetown Christiania, an autonomous haven in central Copenhagen.\n\nAround the turn of the 21st century, libertarian socialism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti-war, anti-capitalist and anti-globalisation movements. Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Group of Eight and the World Economic Forum. Some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting, property destruction and violent confrontations with police. These actions were precipitated by ad hoc, leaderless, anonymous cadres known as black blocs and other organizational tactics pioneered in this time include security culture, affinity groups and the use of decentralized technologies such as the Internet. A significant event of this period was the confrontations at WTO conference in Seattle in 1999. For English anarchist scholar Simon Critchley, \"contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful critique of the pseudo-libertarianism of contemporary neo-liberalism...One might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility, whether sexual, ecological or socio-economic; it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the West ravages the rest; it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality, impoverishment and disenfranchisment that is so palpable locally and globally\". This might also have been motivated by \"the collapse of 'really existing socialism' and the capitulation to neo-liberalism of Western social democracy\".\n\nLibertarian socialists in the early 21st century have been involved in the alter-globalization movement, squatter movement; social centers; infoshops; anti-poverty groups such as Ontario Coalition Against Poverty and Food Not Bombs; tenants' unions; housing cooperatives; intentional communities generally and egalitarian communities; anti-sexist organizing; grassroots media initiatives; digital media and computer activism; experiments in participatory economics; anti-racist and anti-fascist groups like Anti-Racist Action and Anti-Fascist Action; activist groups protecting the rights of immigrants and promoting the free movement of people, such as the No Border network; worker co-operatives, countercultural and artist groups; and the peace movement.\n\nIn the United States, polls (circa 2006) find that the views and voting habits of between 10 and 20 percent (and increasing) of voting age Americans may be classified as \"fiscally conservative and socially liberal, or libertarian\". This is based on pollsters and researchers defining libertarian views as fiscally conservative and socially liberal (based on the common United States meanings of the terms) and against government intervention in economic affairs and for expansion of personal freedoms. Through 20 polls on this topic spanning 13 years, Gallup found that voters who are libertarian on the political spectrum ranged from 17–23% of the United States electorate. However, a 2014 Pew Poll found that 23% of Americans who identify as libertarians have no idea what the word means.\n\n2009 saw the rise of the Tea Party movement, an American political movement known for advocating a reduction in the United States national debt and federal budget deficit by reducing government spending and taxes, which had a significant libertarian component despite having contrasts with libertarian values and views in some areas, such as nationalism, free trade, social issues and immigration. A 2011 Reason-Rupe poll found that among those who self-identified as Tea Party supporters, 41 percent leaned libertarian and 59 percent socially conservative. The movement, named after the Boston Tea Party, also contains conservative and populist elements and has sponsored multiple protests and supported various political candidates since 2009. Tea Party activities have declined since 2010 with the number of chapters across the country slipping from about 1,000 to 600. Mostly, Tea Party organizations are said to have shifted away from national demonstrations to local issues. Following the selection of Paul Ryan as Mitt Romney's 2012 vice presidential running mate, \"The New York Times\" declared that Tea Party lawmakers are no longer a fringe of the conservative coalition, but now \"indisputably at the core of the modern Republican Party\".\nIn 2012, anti-war presidential candidates (Libertarian Republican Ron Paul and Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson) raised millions of dollars and garnered millions of votes despite opposition to their obtaining ballot access by Democrats and Republicans. The 2012 Libertarian National Convention, which saw Gary Johnson and James P. Gray nominated as the 2012 presidential ticket for the Libertarian Party, resulted in the most successful result for a third-party presidential candidacy since 2000 and the best in the Libertarian Party's history by vote number. Johnson received 1% of the popular vote, amounting to more than 1.2 million votes. Johnson has expressed a desire to win at least 5 percent of the vote so that the Libertarian Party candidates could get equal ballot access and federal funding, thus subsequently ending the two-party system.\n\nSince the 1950s, many American libertarian organizations have adopted a free market stance, as well as supporting civil liberties and non-interventionist foreign policies. These include the Ludwig von Mises Institute, Francisco Marroquín University, the Foundation for Economic Education, Center for Libertarian Studies, the Cato Institute and Liberty International. The activist Free State Project, formed in 2001, works to bring 20,000 libertarians to New Hampshire to influence state policy. Active student organizations include Students for Liberty and Young Americans for Liberty.\n\nA number of countries have libertarian parties that run candidates for political office. In the United States, the Libertarian Party was formed in 1972 and is the third largest American political party, with over 370,000 registered voters in the 35 states that allow registration as a Libertarian and has hundreds of party candidates elected or appointed to public office.\n\nCurrent international anarchist federations which sometimes identify themselves as libertarian include the International of Anarchist Federations, the International Workers' Association, and International Libertarian Solidarity. The largest organized anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the Confederación General del Trabajo (CGT) and the CNT. CGT membership was estimated to be around 100,000 for 2003. Other active syndicalist movements include the Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden and the Swedish Anarcho-syndicalist Youth Federation in Sweden; the Unione Sindacale Italiana in Italy; Workers Solidarity Alliance in the United States; and Solidarity Federation in the United Kingdom. The revolutionary industrial unionist Industrial Workers of the World claiming 2,000 paying members as well as the International Workers Association, an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the First International, also remain active. In the United States, there exists the Common Struggle – Libertarian Communist Federation.\n\nCriticism of libertarianism includes ethical, economic, environmental, pragmatic, and philosophical concerns. It has also been argued that \"laissez-faire\" capitalism does not necessarily produce the best or most efficient outcome, nor does its philosophy of individualism and policies of deregulation prevent the abuse of natural resources.\nCritics such as Corey Robin describe right-libertarianism as fundamentally a reactionary conservative ideology, united with more traditional conservative thought and goals by a desire to enforce hierarchical power and social relations:Conservatism, then, is not a commitment to limited government and liberty—or a wariness of change, a belief in evolutionary reform, or a politics of virtue. These may be the byproducts of conservatism, one or more of its historically specific and ever-changing modes of expression. But they are not its animating purpose. Neither is conservatism a makeshift fusion of capitalists, Christians, and warriors, for that fusion is impelled by a more elemental force—the opposition to the liberation of men and women from the fetters of their superiors, particularly in the private sphere. Such a view might seem miles away from the libertarian defense of the free market, with its celebration of the atomistic and autonomous individual. But it is not. When the libertarian looks out upon society, he does not see isolated individuals; he sees private, often hierarchical, groups, where a father governs his family and an owner his employees.\n\nJohn Donahue argues that if political power were radically shifted to local authorities, parochial local interests would predominate at the expense of the whole and that this would exacerbate current problems with collective action.\n\nMichael Lind has observed that of the 195 countries in the world today, none have fully actualized a libertarian society: \n\nLind has also criticized libertarianism, particularly the right-wing and free market variant of the ideology, as being incompatible with democracy and apologetic towards autocracy. In response, libertarian Warren Redlich argues that the United States \"was extremely libertarian from the founding until 1860, and still very libertarian until roughly 1930.\"\n\n"}

Lying in repose differs from the more formal honor of lying in state, which is generally held at the principal government building of the deceased person's country and often accompanied by a guard of honour.\n\nIn the United States, the distinction between lying in repose and lying in state is not often observed. Lying in state is generally considered to be when one's body is placed in the rotunda of the United States Capitol. When the deceased person is placed in another location, like the Great Hall of the Supreme Court, they lie in repose, as was the case following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016.\n\nThe remains of presidents who die in office generally lie in repose in the East Room of the White House while those of a deceased former president generally lie in repose in his home state. However, as an example to the contrary, when the body of John F. Kennedy lay in repose, the term meant \"private\" as opposed to a public lying in state.\n\nThe body of Babe Ruth lay in repose in Yankee Stadium.\n\nThe body of singer Israel Kamakawiwo'ole lay in repose in the state capital building of Hawaii in 1997. \n\nNot everyone eligible to lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda does so. For instance, the body of former President Richard Nixon lay in repose at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library in Yorba Linda, California, Senator Edward Kennedy's body lay in repose at the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, Massachusetts, and Senator Robert Byrd's body lay in repose in the Senate chamber at the Capitol.\n\nIn Canada, when deceased governors general and prime ministers lie anywhere outside of the Centre Block of Parliament Hill, they lie in repose. In the Hall of Honour, the Senate, or the foyer of the House of Commons, they lie in state.\n\nAt the provincial, territorial or local levels, current and former politicians may lie in state or repose in government buildings.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "992052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=992052", "title": "Man-eating tree", "text": "Man-eating tree\n\nMan-eating tree can refer to any of the various legendary carnivorous plants large enough to kill and consume a person or other large animal. \n\nThe earliest well-known report of a man-eating tree originated as a literary fabrication written by Edmund Spencer for the \"New York World\". Spencer's article first appeared in the daily edition of the \"New York World\" on 26 April 1874, and appeared again in the weekly edition of the newspaper two days later. In the article, a letter was published by a purported German explorer named \"Karl Leche\" (also spelled as Karl or Carl Liche in later accounts), who provided a report of encountering a sacrifice performed by the \"Mkodo tribe\" of Madagascar: This story was picked up by many other newspapers of the day, which included the \"South Australian Register\" of 27 October 1874, where it gained even greater notoriety. Describing the tree, the account related:\n\nThe slender delicate palpi, with the fury of starved serpents, quivered a moment over her head, then as if instinct with demoniac intelligence fastened upon her in sudden coils round and round her neck and arms; then while her awful screams and yet more awful laughter rose wildly to be instantly strangled down again into a gurgling moan, the tendrils one after another, like great green serpents, with brutal energy and infernal rapidity, rose, retracted themselves, and wrapped her about in fold after fold, ever tightening with cruel swiftness and savage tenacity of anacondas fastening upon their prey.\n\nThe tree was given further publicity by \"Madagascar: Land of the Man-eating Tree\", a book by Chase Osborn, who had been a Governor of Michigan. Osborn claimed that both the tribes and missionaries on Madagascar knew about the hideous tree, repeated the above Liche account, and acknowledged \"I do not know whether this tigerish tree really exists or whether the bloodcurdling stories about it are pure myth. It is enough for my purpose if its story focuses your interest upon one of the least known spots of the world.\" \n\nIn his 1955 book, \"Salamanders and other Wonders\", science author Willy Ley determined that the Mkodo tribe, Carl Liche, and the Madagascar man-eating tree all appeared to be fabrications: \"The facts are pretty clear by now. Of course the man eating tree does not exist. There is no such tribe.\"\n\nIn J. W. Buel's \"Sea and Land\" (1887), the \"Yateveo\" plant is described as being native to Africa and Central America, so named for producing a hissing sound similar to the Spanish phrase \"ya-te-veo\" (lit. \"I-see-you\"), and having poisonous \"spines\" that resemble \"many huge serpents in an angry discussion, occasionally darting from side to side as if striking at an imaginary foe\" which seize and pierce any creature coming within reach.\n\nWilliam Thomas Stead, editor of \"Review of Reviews,\" published a brief article in October 1891 that discussed a story found \"Lucifer\" magazine, describing a plant in Nicaragua called by the natives the devil's snare. This plant had the capability \"to drain the blood of any living thing which comes within its death-dealing touch.\" According to the article:\n\nMr. Dunstan, naturalist, who has recently returned from Central America, where he spent nearly two years in the study of the flora and the fauna of the country, relates the finding of a singular growth in one of the swamps which surround the great lakes of Nicaragua. He was engaged in hunting for botanical and entomological specimens, when he heard his dog cry out, as if in agony, from a distance. Running to the spot whence the animal's cries came. Mr. Dunstan found him enveloped in a perfect network of what seemed to be a fine rope-like tissue of roots and fibers... The native servants who accompanied Mr. Dunstan manifested the greatest horror of the vine, which they call \"the devil's snare\", and were full of stories of its death-dealing powers. He was able to discover very little about the nature of the plant, owing to the difficulty of handling it, for its grasp can only be torn away with the loss of skin and even of flesh; but, as near as Mr. Dunstan could ascertain, its power of suction is contained in a number of infinitesimal mouths or little suckers, which, ordinarily closed, open for the reception of food. If the substance is animal, the blood is drawn off and the carcass or refuse then dropped.\n\nAn investigation of Stead's review determined no such article was published in the October issue of \"Lucifer\", and concluded that the story in \"Review of Reviews\" appeared to be a fabrication by the editor. The story in fact appeared in the September issue, proceeded by a longer version in an 1889 newspaper describing Dunston as a \"well-known naturalist\" from New Orleans.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1257710", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1257710", "title": "Material culture", "text": "Material culture\n\nMaterial culture is the physical aspect of culture in the objects and architecture that surround people. It includes usage, consumption, creation, and trade of objects as well as the behaviors, norms, and rituals that the objects create or take part in. Some scholars also include other intangible phenomena that include sound, smell and events, while some even consider language as part of it. The term is commonly used in archaeological and anthropological studies, specifically focusing on the material evidence that can be attributed to culture in the past or present. It is usually synonymous with artifacts, which humans use to cope with the physical world, facilitate social intercourse, and benefit man's state of mind.\n\nThe scholarly analysis of material culture - the human-made or altered things - is called material culture studies. It is an interdisciplinary field that tells of the relationships between people and their things: the making, history, preservation, and interpretation of objects. It draws on both theory and practice from the social sciences and humanities such as art history, archaeology, anthropology, history, historic preservation, folklore, literary criticism and museum studies, among others. Anything from buildings and architectural elements to books, jewelry, or toothbrushes can be considered material culture.\n\nResearch in several areas looked into the reasons for perceiving an object with meaning. Common reasons for valuing material lie in their monetary or sentimental value.\n\nA well-known related theory is Kahneman's endowment effect theory. According to Kahneman, people evaluate objects they own with higher value than the same object if they do not own it. The endowment effect was found to occur as soon as the item is acquired and to increase over time.\n\nAnother way in which material can hold meaning and value is by carrying communication between people, just like other communication forms such as speech, touch and gesture. An object can mediate messages between time, or space, or both between people who are not together. A work of art, for example, can transfer a message from the creator to the viewer and share an image, a feeling, or an experience. Material can contain memories and mutual experiences across time and influence thoughts and feelings. A study found that couples who have more items that were jointly acquired and more favorite items among them had higher-quality relationships.\n\nResearchers from the fields of sociology, psychology, and anthropology have also been fascinated by gift-giving, a universal phenomenon that holds emotional meaning using material culture. According to Schieffelin, \"gift-giving is a vehicle of social obligation and political maneuver.\" Mauss defines the gift as creating a special bond between the giver and the receiver. According to Mauss, the giver never really leaves the gift but becomes part of the receiver's future by inserting the gift into their life. A gift leads at some point to another gift in response, which creates a special reciprocal bond between people.\n\nMaterial culture studies as an academic field grew along the field of anthropology and so began by studying non-Western material culture. All too often, it was a way of putting material culture into categories in such a way that marginalized and hierarchized the cultures from which they came. During the \"golden age\" of museum-going, material cultures were used to show the supposed evolution of society from the simple objects of non-Westerners to the advanced objects of Europeans. It was a way of showing that Europeans were at the end of the evolution of society, with non-Westerners at the beginning. Eventually, scholars left the notion that culture evolved though predictable cycles, and the study of material culture changed to have a more objective view of non-Western material culture.\n\nThe origins of the field of material culture studies as its own distinct discipline dates back to the 1990s. The \"Journal of Material Culture\" started putting out publications only in 1996. However, in a sense that can be thought of as younger for tying closely to ethnographic work and collecting habits. Collecting habits date back to hundreds of years ago.\n\nLeslie White was an American anthropologist, known for his advocacy of theories of cultural evolution, sociocultural evolution, and especially neoevolutionism and for his role in creating the department of anthropology at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor. He was president of the American Anthropological Association (1964). He wrote \"The Science of Culture\" in 1949 in which he outlined schema of the world as divided into cultural, biological, and physical levels of phenomenon. White believed that the development of culture rested primarily on technology and that the history of human technology could be understood through the study of human-produced materials.\n\nAmerican anthropologist James Deetz, known for his work in the field of historical archaeology, wrote the book \"In Small Things Forgotten\" in 1977 and published a revised and expanded version in 1996. He pioneered there the ideas of using neglected substances such as trash pits, potshards, and soil stains to reveal human actions. By analyzing objects in association with their location, the history of that location, the objects they were found with, and not singling out the most valuable or rarest ones, archaeologists can create a more accurate picture of daily life. Deetz looks at the long view of history and investigates the impact of European culture on other cultures across the globe by an analysis of the spread of everyday objects.\n\nIan M. G. Quimby's \"Material Culture and the Study of American Life\", written in 1978, tried to bridge the gaps between the museum world and the university and between curator and historian. Quimby posits that objects in museums are understood through an intellectual framework that uses non-traditional sources. He also describes the benefits of work on exhibit design as a vehicle for education.\n\nThomas Schlereth, Professor Emeritus of American Studies at the University of Notre Dame, wrote about philosophies and methods of teaching history outside the traditional classroom. In his book \"Artifacts and the American Past\", Schlereth defines material culture study as an attempt to explain why things were made, why they took the forms they did, and what social, functional, aesthetic, or symbolic needs they serve. He advocates studying photographs, catalogues, maps and landscapes. He suggests a variety of modes for interrogating artifacts.\n\nGerd Koch, associated with the Ethnological Museum of Berlin, is known for his studies on the material culture of Tuvalu, Kiribati and the Santa Cruz Islands. During his early field work in 1951 to 1952, Koch developed techniques in the recording of culture, including the use of tape recorders and cinematographic cameras.\n\nArchaeology is the study of humanity through the inferential analysis of material culture to ultimately gain an understanding of the daily lives of past cultures and the overarching trend of human history. An archaeological culture is a recurring assemblage of the artifacts from a specific time and place, most often that has no written record. These physical artifacts are then used to make inferences about the ephemeral aspects of culture and history. With more recent societies, written histories, oral traditions, and direct observations may also be available to supplement the study of material culture.\n\nBeginning in the European Renaissance and the culture's fascination with classical antiquities, the study of artifacts from long-lost cultures has produced many forms of archaeological theory, such as trans-cultural diffusion, processual archaeology, and post-processual archaeology. Additionally, archaeological sub-disciplines have emerged within the field, including prehistoric archaeology, classical archaeology, historical archaeology, cognitive archaeology, and cultural ecology. Recently, a scientific methodology and approach to the analysis of pre-historic material culture has become prevalent with systematic excavation techniques producing detailed and precise results.\n\nAnthropology is most simply defined as the study of humans across time and space. In studying a human culture, an anthropologist studies the material culture of the people in question as well as the people themselves and their interactions with others. To understand the culture in which an object is featured, an anthropologist looks at the object itself, its context, and the way that it was manufactured and used.\n\nThe first anthropologist interested in studying material culture was Lewis Henry Morgan, in the mid-19th century. He is most known for his research on kinship and social structures, but he also studied the effect of material culture, specifically technology, on the evolution of a society. Later in the 19th century, Franz Boas brought the fields of anthropology and material culture studies closer together. He believed that it was crucial for an anthropologist to analyze not only the physical properties of material culture but also its meanings and uses in its indigenous context to begin to understand a society. At the same time in France, Émile Durkheim wrote about the importance of material culture in understanding a society. Durkheim saw material culture as one of the social facts that functions as a coercive force to maintain solidarity in a society.\n\nClaude Lévi-Strauss, in the 20th century, included the study of material culture in his work as an anthropologist because he believed that it could reveal a deeper level of structure and meaning unattainable by typical fieldwork. According to Lévi-Strauss, material culture can recall the mindset of a people, regardless of intervening time or space. Also in the 20th century, Mary Douglas thought that anthropology was about studying the meaning of material culture to the people who experience it. Marvin Harris, a contemporary of Douglas, put forward the theory of cultural materialism and said that all aspects of society have material causes.\n\nIn archaeology, the idea that social relations are embodied in material is well known and established, with extensive research on exchange, gift giving and objects as part of social ceremonies and events. However, in contradiction to archaeology, where scientists build on material remains of previous cultures, sociology tends to overlook the importance of material in understanding relationships and human social behavior.\n\nThe social aspects in material culture include the social behavior around it: the way that the material is used, shared, talked about, or made. An object cannot hold meaning in and of itself and so when one focuses on the social aspects of material culture, it is critical to keep in mind that interpretations of objects and of interactions with them are the ones to evoke importance and meaning.\n\nMuseums and other material culture repositories, by their very nature, are often active participants in the heritage industry. Defined as \"the business of managing places that are important to an area's history and encouraging people to visit them,\" the heritage industry relies heavily on material culture and objects to interpret cultural heritage. The industry is fueled by a cycle of people visiting museums, historic sites, and collections to interact with ideas or physical objects of the past. In turn, the institutions profit through monetary donations or admission fees as well as the publicity that comes with word-of-mouth communications.\n\nThat relationship is controversial, as many believe that the heritage industry corrupts the meaning and importance of cultural objects. Often, scholars in the humanities take a critical view of the heritage industry, particularly heritage tourism, believing it to be a vulgar oversimplification and corruption of historic fact and importance. Others believe that the relationship and the financial stability it brings is often the element that allows curators, researchers, and directors to conserve material culture's legacy.\n\nSome observers advocate intentionally altering the material cultures created by current civilizations. For example, waste reduction advocates within environmentalism advocate teaching design approaches, such as cradle-to-cradle design and appropriate technology. Anti-consumerism advocates encourage consuming less (thus creating fewer artifacts), engaging in more do-it-yourself projects and self-sufficiency (changing the quality of artifacts produced), and localism impacts the geographic distribution and uniformity of artifacts.\n\n"}

This term has been greatly developed by Andreas Wimmer and Nina Glick Schiller, who specifically define methodological nationalism as \"understood as the assumption that the nation/state/society is the natural social and political form of the modern world\". Methodological Nationalism has been identified in many social science subfields, such as anthropology, sociology, and the interdisciplinary field of migration studies. Methodological Nationalism, as a practice within Social Science, has been further critiqued by scholars such as Saskia Sassen, who contends that the nation-state and its borders are an insufficient unit of analysis and that the national is at times the \"terrains of the global\".\n\nPer Andreas Wimmer and Nina Glick Schiller, there are three types of methodological nationalism in social science scholarship: ignoring or disregarding the importance of nationalism for modern societies, naturalization, and confining studies to geopolitical boundaries of a particular nation-state. These types may co-occur or occur separately. When they co-occur, they may reinforce each other.\n\nMethodological Nationalism and its conception of nation-states has been a component of both contemporary and historical methodologies in migration studies, insofar as certain studies have adhered to it or diverged from its theoretical foundations. This adherence has been acknowledged or otherwise criticized in numerous studies. Moreover, the historical prevalence of methodological nationalism within social science has been explored by scholarship which argues that many turn-of-the-century writings on globalization have \"conflated the necessary\nconceptual critique of methodological nationalism with the empirical claim of the\nnation-state’s diminishing relevance\".\n\nOn the other hand, research on transnationalism and transmigrants has contemporary examples of divergence and criticism of methodological nationalism as an enduring practice in scholarship. Recent studies in transnationalism have conceived of the nation-state as one agent in a complex relationship with many global actors. Migration Studies that conceive of society as extending beyond national boundaries, then, sever this link between nation-state and society.\n\nResearch on transnational Latina motherhood has negotiated issues of the nation-state as well as transnationalism. The conceptual frameworks of power geometries, social location, and geographic scales is positiojed to counteract the analytical tendency to fall back on methodological nationalism.\n\nOther scholarly research has combined transnational migration studies and conceptual frameworks such as coloniality of power to avoid methodological nationalism and better account for the intersecting transnational phenomena that constitutes the experiences of transmigrants and better explains the processes of transnational migration.\n\nThis video is of a lecture by Sujata Patel at University of Hyderabad (India), given on September 21, 2011 talking about effects of Methodological Nationalism in India.

Navarth in person appears more eccentric than mad, a Salvador Dalí-ish petulant extrovert and creator of 'happenings', one of the more amiable in a long line of Vance's self-absorbed egotists. We first encounter him on Earth, old and forgotten, living in reduced circumstances on a canal-boat in the ancient (but fictitious) city of Rollingshaven: apparently a Vanceian conflation of Rotterdam, Antwerp and Hamburg. The chief protagonist of the novel sequence, Kirth Gersen, induces Navarth to help him in his quest to find the galactic master criminal Viole Falushe (with whom Navarth was long ago involved when the criminal was merely the schoolboy Vogel Filschner), and the pair eventually travel through space to Falushe’s notorious Palace of Love in the far Beyond.\n\nNavarth published a volume of poetry called \"Pullulations\" (cited in \"Throy\", Chapter 6); another (presumably posthumous) volume in circulation was \"The Lyrics of Mad Navarth\" (cited in \"Araminta Station\", Chapter 9).

A successor to \"The Harp of Columbia\" published by Swan and his father, W.H. Swan, in 1848, \"The New Harp\" includes a mixture of hymn tunes, folk hymns, fuguing pieces, and anthems, along with several of Swan's original compositions. The book maintains popularity in East Tennessee, with about 20 singings in 2004.\n\nMarcus Lafayette Swan was born in Knoxville in 1827, the son of prominent lawyer William H. Swan, Jr. (1798–1859). In 1847, his father married Hannah Wells Crozier, who hailed from a prominent family of Knoxville politicians and businesspeople. The Croziers' business enterprises included a printing company, Crozier & Barton, which had published hymn books as early as 1825, and thus may have inspired the Swans to publish their own collection of songs. \"The Harp of Columbia\", published by the Swans as a singing school manual in 1848, was moderately successful, and was reprinted several times during the 1850s. \n\nDuring the Civil War, Marcus Swan supported the Confederacy, and fled to Bellefonte, Alabama, when the Union Army occupied Knoxville. While living in Bellefonte, he wrote the introduction to \"The New Harp of Columbia\", which was published in Knoxville in 1867. By the time of his death, Swan had amassed a relatively large fortune. \n\n\"The New Harp of Columbia\" has been reprinted numerous times since its initial publication. Musicologist Dorothy Horn suggests the success of \"The New Harp\" is due to its excellent printing and its larger than normal sample of standard tunes favored by various Protestant denominations. \n\nThe \"New Harp of Columbia\" contains a unique seven-shape system devised by the Swans, which differs from the \"standard\" seven-shape notation developed by songmaster Jesse B. Aikin during the same period. Marcus Swan kept much of the material from \"The Harp of Columbia\", but also included several tunes by popular hymn composer Lowell Mason and several of his own compositions. A 2001 \"Restored Edition\" of \"The New Harp\" adds a section of 39 pages of tunes from the 1848 \"Harp of Columbia\" which were not included in the original \"New Harp of Columbia\".\n\nThe songs in \"The New Harp\" come from both European (especially English and Scottish) and American singing traditions. Along with Swan's compositions, \"The New Harp\" includes songs such as \"Coronation\" by Oliver Holden, \"Easter Anthem\" and \"Rose of Sharon\" by William Billings, \"Creation\" by Nehemiah Shumway, \"Arlington\" by Thomas Arne, and \"Duke Street\" by John Hatton. The book also includes a number of folk hymns, such as \"Promised Land,\" \"Idumea,\" and \"Golden Hill.\" Several tunes were derived from European folk songs, such as \"Hamburg\" (derived from \"Auld Lang Syne\"), \"Bruce's Address\" (from \"Scots Wha Hae\"), and \"Marston\" (from \"Farmer in the Dell\").\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6435170", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6435170", "title": "Origin of Rashtrakuta Dynasty", "text": "Origin of Rashtrakuta Dynasty\n\nThe origin of the Rashtrakuta Dynasty has been a controversial topic and has been debated over the past decades by historians. The differing opinions mostly revolve around issues such as the home of the earliest ancestors of the medieval Rashtrakutas, a possible southern migration during the early part of the first millennium and the relationship between the several Rashtrakuta dynasties that ruled small kingdoms in northern and central India and the Deccan in the 6th century - 7th century. Further, the relationship of these medieval Rashtrakutas to the most important and famous dynasty, the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta of the 8th century - 10th century time period has also been debated. Also contested is whether the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta were related by ancestry to the early Kannada, Maratha, Rajput, Reddi or Punjabi communities of the Deccan and northern India.\n\nWhile the history of the early Rashtrakutas has caused much debate, the history of the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta (in present-day Gulbarga) of the 8th–10th centuries can be accurately constructed because numerous contemporaneous inscriptions and texts refer to them. The crux of the Manyakheta empire extended from the Kaveri river in the south to the Narmada in the north. At their peak they were the only south Indian empire that conquered regions in far northern India (Kannauj) as well as the extreme south (Tamilakam). The Lata branch of the empire (in present-day Gujarat) was an important dynasty belonging to the Manyakheta family line which later merged with the Manyakheta kingdom during the 9th century.\n\nThe study of the history of the early Rashtrakutas and the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta has been made possible by the availability of numerous inscriptions spread all over the Deccan, ancient literature in Pali, contemporaneous Kannada literature such as \"Kavirajamarga\" (850) and \"Vikramarjuna Vijaya\" (941), Sanskrit writings by Somadeva, Rajashekara, Gunabhadra, Jinasena and others and the notes of Arab travellers of those times such as Suleiman, Ibn Haukal, Al Masudi, Al Istakhri and others. Scholars have left no topic unstudied in an effort to accurately propose the history of the Rashtrakutas. Theories about their lineage (\"Surya Vamsa\" or \"Chandra Vamsa\"), native region and ancestral home have been proposed using clues from inscriptions, royal emblems, ancient clan names such as \"Rashtrika\", epithets such as \"Ratta\", \"Rashtrakuta\", \"Lattalura Puravaradhiswara\", names of royalty, coins and contemporaneous literature. These theories from noted scholars have resulted in claims that the Rashtrakutas were from either Rajput, Kannadiga,Reddi, Maratha, or Punjabi origin.\n\nThe appearance of the terms \"Rathika\", \"Ristika\" (\"Rashtrika\") or \"Lathika\" in conjunction with the terms \"Kambhoja\" and \"Gandhara\" in some Ashokan inscriptions of the 2nd century BCE from Mansera and Shahbazgarhi in North Western Frontier Province (present day Pakistan), Girnar (Saurashtra) and Dhavali (Kalinga) and the use of the epithet \"Ratta\" in many later inscriptions has prompted a claim that the earliest Rashtrakutas were descendants of the \"Arattas\", natives of the Punjab region from the time of Mahabharata who later migrated south and set up kingdoms there, while another theory points more generally to north western regions of India. Based on this theory, the Arattas may have become natives of the Deccan having arrived there during the early centuries of the first millennium.\n\nThis is counter to the argument by other scholars that the term \"Rishtika\" used together with \"Petenika\" in the Ashokan inscriptions implied they were hereditary ruling clans from modern Maharashtra region and the term \"Ratta\" implied \"Maharatta\" ruling families from modern Maharashtra region. But this has been rejected on the basis that from ancient books such as \"Dipavamsha\" and \"Mahavamsha\" in Pali language it is known the term \"Maharatta\" and not \"Rashtrika\" has been used to signify hereditary ruling clans from modern Maharashtra region and the terms \"Rashtrika\" and \"Petenika\" appear to be two different displaced ruling tribes.\n\nIt is noted by another scholar that ruling clans called \"Rathis\" and \"Maharathis\" were in power in parts of present-day Karnataka as well in the early centuries of the Christian era, which is known inscriptions from the region and further proven by the discovery of lead coins from the middle of 3rd century bearing \"Sadakana Kalalaya Maharathi\" in the heart of modern Karnataka region near Chitradurga. In the face of these facts it is claimed it can no longer be maintained that the \"Rathi\" and \"Maharathi\" families were confined only to present day Maharashtra. It is claimed there is sufficient inscriptional evidence that several \"Maharathi\" families were related to Kannadiga families by marriage and they were naga worshippers, a form of worship very popular in the Mysore region (modern Karnataka). Also, no evidence to confirm that these families were either Aryan or non-Aryan is available.\n\nThe epithet \"Ratta\", it is also claimed is a Kannada word from which the word \"Rashtrakuta\" has been derived. The use of the word \"Rattagudlu\" (meaning an office) has been found in inscriptions from present day Andhra Pradesh dated prior to the 8th century indicating it was a South Indian word. From the Deoli plates and Karhad records it is argued there was a prince called Ratta and his son was called Rashtrakuta. Hence it has been argued the Rashtrakutas were of Kannada origin. It is also said the term \"Rashtra\" means \"kingdom\" and \"Kuta\" means \"lofty\" or \"Rashtra\" means province and \"Kuta\" means chieftain.\n\nAnother epithet used in inscriptions of Amoghavarsha I was \"Lattalura Puravaradhiswara\". It is proposed that it refers to their original home \"Lattalur\", modern day Latur in Maharashtra state, bordering Karnataka. This area it is claimed was predominantly Kannada speaking based on surviving vestiges of place names, inscriptions and cultural relics. It is explained that \"Latta\" is a Prakrit variation of \"Ratta\" and hence Rattana-ur became Lattana-ur and finally Lattalur. Another theory is that Latalurapura is modern day Ratnapur in Bilaspur district of central India.\n\nIn linking possible connections between the medieval Rashtrakuta families to the imperial family of Manyakheta it has been pointed out that only the family members ruling from Elichpur (Berar or modern Amravati district, modern Maharashtra) had names that were very similar to the names of Kings of the Manyakheta dynasty. From the Tivarkhed and Multhai inscriptions it is clear that the kings of this family were Durgaraja, Govindaraja, Svamikaraja and Nannaraja. These names closely resemble the names of Manyakheta kings or their extended family, the name Govindaraja appearing multiple times among the Manyakheta line. These names also appear in the Gujarat line of Rashtrakutas whose family ties with the Manyakheta family is well known.\n\nIt has been noted that princes and princesses of the Rashtrakuta family used pure Kannada names such as Kambarasa, Asagavve, Revakka and Abbalabbe as their personal names indicating that they were native Kannadigas. It has been pointed out that princesses of family lineage belonging to Gujarat signed their royal edicts in Kannada even in their Sanskrit inscriptions. Some examples of this are the Navsari and Baroda plates of Karka I and the Baroda plates of his son Dhruva II. It has been attested by a scholar that the Gujarat Rashtrakuta princes signed their inscriptions in the language of their native home and the race they belonged to. It is well known that the Gujarat line of Rashtrakutas were from the same family as the Manyakheta line. It is argued that if the Rashtrakutas were originally a Marathi speaking family, then the Gujarat Rashtrakutas would not have signed their inscriptions in Kannada language and that too in far away Gujarat. The theory that under the rule of the Badami Chalukyas of Kannada country, Kannada speaking dynasties were established in the far corners of the Chalukyan empire in Gujarat, Andhra and Berar (present day Vidharba region in modern Maharashtra) and hence the ancestors of King Dantidurga, the founder of the Manyakheta empire were Kannadigas. It is further claimed there is proof that in the locality where Dantidurga lived Kannada was the spoken language.\n\nSeveral Rashtrakuta families ruled India during the 6th century - 7th century period. Scholars have tried to understand their relationship with the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta by a comparative study of the emblems.\n\nThe only Rashtrakuta family whose royal emblem is similar to that of the rulers of Manyakheta, the golden eagle or Garuda \"lanchhana\" (emblem) is that of the family that ruled from Amravathi district of modern Maharashtra. It has been theorised that this line may possibly have been ancestors of the Manyakheta kings. Their inscriptions (Tivarkhed and Multhai) were issued from Achalapura (modern Elichpur) which may have been their capital. Another Rashtrakuta family ruling from Manapura with its founder King Abhimanyu had the emblem of a lion. This makes it improbable that they were the ancestors of the Manyakheta family. The location of Manapura is uncertain. John Faithfull Fleet proposed its identification with Manpur in Malwa, and then with Manpur near Bandhavgarh, but later rejected both these theories himself. Bhagawanlal Indraji identified it with Manyakheta (Malkhed) itself. Vasudev Vishnu Mirashi identified it with Man, Satara.\n\nWhile the Garuda is normally indicative Vaishnavite leanings, it has to be observed here that earlier coins belonging to King Krishna I's period use the legend \"Parama Maheshwara\", which in turn indicate staunch Shaivite leanings. This change in symbology has been used to theorise that the Rashtrakutas may have originally been Shaivites and embraced Vaishnavism later.\n\nWith regards to their \"vamsha\" (whether they belonged to \"Surya Vamsha\" (solar lineage) or \"Chandra Vamsha\" (lunar lineage), Rashtrakuta inscriptions remained silent on the issue, until about 860. Some 75 inscriptions have been found thereafter in the Deccan and Gujarat which speak about their \"vamsha\". Of these, only 8 lay claim that they belonged to the Yadava line. While one inscription of 860 claims that King Dantidurga was born to the \"Yadava Satyaki\", 1800 coins of King Krishna I (772), his successor calls him \"Parama Mahesvara\" indicating his solar lineage origin and Shaiva faith. An inscription of King Govinda III (808) mentions \"by the birth of this virtuous king, the Rashtrakuta dynasty became invincible just as the Yadava dynasty by the birth of Lord Krishna\". This is considered only a comparative statement. Only a few records attest to a possible Yadava connection and even the descendants of the Rashtrakutas such as the Gahadavalas of Kanauj, Rathors of Rajasthan claim to be from \"Surya Vamsha\" (solar lineage), a sure sign the Rashtrakutas belonged to the \"Surya Vamsha\". The opinion that the Rashtrakutas did not belong to the Yadava line is supported by another scholar as well.\n\nWhile the linguistic leanings of the early Rashtrakutas (pre-8th century) has caused considerable debate, the history and language of the imperial Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta has been free of such confusion. It is clear from inscriptions, coinage and prolific contemporaneous literature that the court of these Rashtrakutas was multi-lingual, and used Sanskrit and Kannada as their administrative languages and encouraged literature in Sanskrit and Kannada. Rashtrakuta inscriptions outside Karnataka are mostly in Sanskrit However this period was the very end of the classical era of literary Sanskrit and Prakrit. As such, from the Kavirajamarga of the 9th century, it is known that Kannada was popular from Kaveri river up to the Godavari river, an area covering large territory in modern Maharashtra.\n\nThe Rashtrakuta inscriptions call them the vanquishers of the \"Karnatabala\", a sobriquet used to refer to the near invincibility of the Chalukyas of Badami. This however it is claimed should not be construed to mean that the Rashtrakutas themselves were not Kannadigas. Their patronage and love of the Kannada language is apparent in that most of their inscriptions within modern Karnataka are in Kannada, while their inscriptions outside of modern Karnataka tended to be in Sanskrit. An inscription in classical Kannada of King Krishna III has also been found as far away as Jabalpur in modern Madhya Pradesh which further supports the view of their affinity to the language.\n\nAdikavi Pampa, Sri Ponna, Shivakotiacharya and King Amoghavarsha I were among the noteworthy scholars in Kannada, the Apabhramsha poet Pushpadanta wrote several works and famous Sanskrit scholars such as Jinasena and Virasena (both of whom were theologians), mathematician Mahaviracharya and poets such as Trivikrama and Gunabhadra adorned their courts. The earliest extant Kannada literature belongs to this time. These Rashtrakuta kings married princess from Northern and Southern India and several Rashtrakuta branches emerged in Northern India during their imperialistic expansion in the 9th century.\n\nThe argument that the Rashtrakutas were either Marathi speaking Marathas or Telugu speaking Reddies in origin has been rejected. Reddy's in that time period had not come into martial prominence even in the Telugu speaking regions of Andhra, being largely an agrarian society of cultivators who only much later (in the 14th century - 15th century) came to control regions in the Krishna - Rajamundry districts. The Rashtrakuta period did not produce any Marathi inscriptions or literature (with the exception of a 981 CE Shravanabelagola inscription which some historians argue was inscribed later). In addition very few literary works in Prakrit language are available from this period. Jainism which played such an important role in giving patronage to early Kannada literature did not flourish as much in the present day Maharashtra region which is why no Marathi literature emerged during this period. Hence Marathi as the language of the Rashtrakutas, it is claimed, is not an acceptable argument.\n\n\n"}

The government started a crackdown in 2004, which included the jailing of a woman.\n\nSince 2008, the production of pornographic films has been banned by state censors, the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television's prohibition on pornography has been complete, and the government has shown no signs of changing course. Directors, producers, and actors involved in pornographic films have been barred from competing in any film competitions. Any film studio found in violation may have its license revoked. As a result of this regulation and censorship, adult films and media can only be obtained through the Internet and on the black market. Possession of pornography is punishable by up to 3 years in prison, a fine of , or up to life imprisonment for large underground distributors. In 2010 China shut down 60,000 pornographic websites according to the news agency Reuters, arresting almost 5,000 suspects in the process.\n\nIn Hong Kong, pornography is illegal if sold or shown to children under 18 years of age, if it is publicly displayed (except within the confines of and only visible from inside a \"bona fide art gallery or museum\"), or if it is sold without being wrapped completely with an \"easily noticeable\" warning stating that the material may be offensive and may not be distributed to minors.\n\nPornography in Japan includes pornography ranging from well-known sex acts such as bukkake to sexual fetish pornography such as tamakeri.\n\nAs in Europe, photographs of nudes are not uncommon in the mainstream media. In the 1970s and 1980s, the strongest prohibition was against showing pubic hair or adult genitalia. Imported magazines would have the pubic hair scratched out, and even the most explicit videos could not portray it. Starting around 1991, photobook publishers began challenging this ban to the point where pubic hair is now fairly well accepted. Close-ups of genitalia remain proscribed. In 1999, the government enacted a law banning photos and videos of naked children, which were a fairly common sight in mainstream media before that time. Manga and anime remain largely unregulated, although large publishers tend to self-censor or specify that characters are at least 18 years of age.\n\nThe 1960s, in Japanese pornography, was the era of the independent \"Pink film\". In the years since the end of World War II, eroticism had been gradually making its way into Japanese cinema. The first kiss to be seen in Japanese film—discreetly half-hidden by an umbrella—caused a national sensation in 1946. Nevertheless, until the early 1960s, graphic depictions of nudity and sex in Japanese film could only be seen in single-reel \"stag films\", made illegally by underground film producers such as those depicted in Imamura's film \"The Pornographers\" (1966).\nNudity and sex would officially enter the Japanese cinema with the independent, low-budget softcore pornographic films which would come to dominate domestically produced films in the 1960s and 1970s. These films were called \"eroductions\" during the early 1960s, but are now more commonly referred to as \"pink films\". The first true \"pink film\", and the first Japanese movie with nude scenes, was Satoru Kobayashi's controversial and popular independent production, \"Flesh Market\" (\"Nikutai no Ichiba\", 1962), starring Tamaki Katori. Katori would go on to star in over 600 \"pink films\" throughout the 1960s, earning the nickname the \"Pink Princess\".\nIn 1964 Tetsuji Takechi made the first big-budget, mainstream \"pink film\", \"Daydream\". Takechi would remake \"Daydream\" as Japan's first theatrical hardcore film in 1981, starring Kyoko Aizome.\n\nImported works of pornography have been available in North Korea in recent decades, mainly in the capital Pyongyang and typically in the form of CD-R copies bought secretly at markets. There is very little domestic production. Producing, distributing, importing and watching pornography is illegal.\n\nPossession of pornography became widespread among elites during the late 1990s. Political and army elites are the most active consumers of pornography. Locally produced pornography initially appeared during the reign of Kim Jong-il. A typical North Korean-made pornographic film involves nude or scantily clad women dancing with music.\n\nImporting pornography to North Korea is harshly punished. Pornography is sold openly on the China–North Korea border regardless of regulations. Despite attempts to curtail circulation of imported pornography, most of the pornography watched in North Korea is currently made abroad. A significant part of pornographic media in circulation consists of Chinese bootleg recordings of poor quality.\n\nThere is no access to foreign pornographic websites from within North Korea.\n\nNorth Korea has ratified the Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. However, there are currently no specific laws to combat child pornography.\n\nPornographic websites, books, writings, films, magazines, photographs or other materials of a pornographic nature are illegal in South Korea, although the law is not regularly enforced. Distribution of pornography can result in a fine or a two-year prison sentence. Since 2009, pornographic websites have been blocked by the South Korean government. In 2012 the Ministry of Public Administration and Security released statistics that cited 39.5% of South Korean children having experienced watching online pornography, with 14.2% of those who have viewed online pornography reportedly \"wanting to imitate\" it.\n\nIn Taiwan pornographic films can be legally traded and pornography is available via a number of routes, including DVD, television and the Internet. The level of piracy of pornographic films in Taiwan is high because authorities have not traditionally recognised their copyrights. Copyright protection is usually strictly applied in Taiwan, but pornography has been seen as an exception.\n\nThe public display of adult material is strictly prohibited. The National Communications Commission (NCC), the Taiwanese media regulator, monitors and categorizes the level of media and public material into four levels. Thus adult material is not seen for sale in authorized shops, but only in small and hidden places. Due to the lack of copyright, adult content produced in Taiwan has stayed in the form of \"webcam chat\". Prostitution is illegal in Taiwan. The Taiwanese government has planned to set up a zone for prostitution.\n\nDue to the high number of expatriates in this country, pornography from various regions such as the Americas, Africa and Europe are easily available in retail shops known as 'kedai runcit'. It is illegal to sell to minors, and it is illegal to produce pornography unless for personal use.\n\nIn conjunction with the Indonesian legal system the criminal code (KUHP) is based on Roman-Dutch law, though a draft revised criminal code (RUU KUHP) is under discussion by the People's Representative Council (DPR). Pornographic material is prohibited by law from the KUHP, the law controlling pornography concerns over the potential danger of criminal offence by pornography as well as preventing under age citizens exposed to pornography. Suggestive materials in Indonesian media are rare. Current laws forbid the selling and buying of pornographic materials.\nThere is a \"Undang-Undang Anti-Pornografi\" (The Law of Anti-Pornography), but this has become controversial as it is seen to objectify women, and it can affect the local culture including some traditional art. What was concerned in the RUU (Law Proposal) is that child abuse is already recognized in KUHP (Kitab Undang-undang Hukum Pidana).\n\nPornography in Indonesia is banned in terms of creating, distribution, selling, and rental of explicit materials. On 30 October 2008, the DPR passed Bill against Pornography and Pornoaction, which is aimed at preventing pornography on widespread Indonesian media. A controversial element of the bill was the definition of pornography. In 2010 the anti-pornography law was challenged but Indonesia's Constitutional Court upheld the ban and stated that the law's definition of pornography was clear and did not violate the constitution.\n\nThe broadness of the law has concerned practitioners of sensual regional traditions such as the nightclubs in Bali, West Javan jaipong dance, and New Guinean penis gourd wearing.\n\nPornography is illegal in Malaysia. Possession of pornographic material is punished by Malaysian criminal law and results in fine and up to 5 years' imprisonment.\n\nThe \"Printing Presses and Publications Act of 1984\" subjects all offline media (such as newspapers, television, and radio stations) to licensing regimes granted at the discretion of ministers. However, the \"Communications and Multimedia Act of 1998\" pledged the Malaysian government to refraining from Internet censorship in Malaysia. Nevertheless, the \"Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission\", the main regulatory authority of information technology and communications industries, prohibits online content that is \"indecent\" or \"obscene\".\n\nIn July 2018, the Malaysian police announced the creation of the Malaysian Internet Crime Against Children Investigation Unit (MICAC) that is equipped with real-time mass Internet surveillance software developed in the United States. It is tasked with the monitoring of all Malaysian Internet users even on mobile phones, with a focus on pornography especially child pornography. The system creates a \"data library\" of users which includes details such as IP addresses, websites, locations, duration and frequency of use and files uploaded and downloaded. Visiting these websites are subject to either questioning by police or imprisonment.\n\nThe national government continues to block many pornographic websites, more than 3,000 were blocked as of 2018. However, only a limited number of these websites are still accessible in Malaysia.\n\nCondom shops selling sex toys and many sex-related products in Malaysia are illegal. There are shops selling them in towns and cities such as Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Ipoh, Kuching and Kota Kinabalu.\n\nEvery type of pornography is prohibited in Myanmar. However, due to ongoing Internet regulation reforms, a very few porn websites are accessible. \n\nAny kind of pornography is illegal in the Philippines. This is due to the influence of conservative Christian groups, such as the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines, and churches, mainly the Roman Catholic Church, among other institutions. The current law does not specifically outlaw webcam-sex websites based in the Philippines. Law enforcement is light, and pornography is available often through black markets and the Internet. There are some urban areas that are known to publicly various kinds of pornographic films.\n\nDespite the existing laws, some reports claimed that the pornography industry in the country earned around US$1 billion annually in 2006, making it the 8th largest pornography industry in the world and the 4th in Asia. This also meant that it held the top rank in the whole Southeast Asia, despite the fact that almost every month, the country's Optical Media Board (OMB) was confiscating hundreds of thousands of counterfeit VCDs and DVDs. From January to September 2008, the OMB confiscated 4,807,012 CDs costing ₱1.4 billion ($29,400,000; based on the prevailing peso-dollar exchange rate on 17 September 2008).\n\nSince 14 January 2017, several pornographic websites including Pornhub and XVideos have been blocked in the Philippines upon the order of President Rodrigo Duterte as part of his Republic Act 9775 or Anti-Child Pornography Law. However, there are a few Internet service providers in the country which still allow access to these websites.\n\nIn Singapore, it is not a crime or offence to visit pornographic websites and view their content. However it is deemed illegal to provide and/or supply any form of pornography from within the country. It is also an offence to be in possession of pornographic material. The 39-year-old Yangtze Cinema, which was probably the only theatre on the island to primarily screen softcore films in the city-state, also closed its doors on February 29, 2016.\n\nThe 287th section of the Thai Penal Code makes it a criminal offence to produce, distribute or possess obscene materials for the purpose of trade. The maximum penalty is up to 3 years' imprisonment. Many types of pornography are prohibited in Thailand, but the law enforcement is relaxed and poorly enforces the prohibition. Some religious minorities may possess pornography for personal use legally because possession for personal use is legal. Other forms of pornography such as yaoi and hentai are illegal but are common over the Internet. The popular Thai actor, model and singer Penpak Sirikul has been a pioneer in Thai pornography.\n\nProduction, distribution, broadcasting, transport, import and advertisement of pornography, is strictly illegal in Vietnam. According to legislatures, pornography harms Vietnamese standard values.\n\nIn Azerbaijan in accordance with article 3 of the Media Act of 7 December 1999, \"pornographic materials\" are defined as works of art, photographic reproductions of paintings, information and other materials the main content of which is the crude and undignified depiction of the anatomical and physiological aspects of sexual relations. Pornography in Azerbaijan is easily and cheaply obtainable in Baku, although not in most other places. There are reports of bribes being charged for taking hardcore pornography across the country's borders. Meanwhile, the legal activity to combat child pornography is governed by 1998 Rights of the Child Act, 1999 Media Act, the Plan of Measures to Solve the Problem of Homeless and Street Children and the National Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons.\n\nThe legal status of pornography in Kazakhstan was changed in 2013 with the introduction of the law: \"On Ratification of the International Convention for Suppression of the Circulation and Traffic of Obscene Publications\". This made it illegal to produce, possess or advertise pornography for the purpose of sale, circulation or public display. Additionally, the law made it a criminal offence to import or export pornography or run a pornography business. It is not an offence to access Internet pornography at home and Kazakhstan does block popular pornographic sites, such as Pornhub, XVideos and xHamster. However accessing Internet pornography at corporations, businesses, or any workplace is prohibited in Kazakhstan.\n\nEven though the legal status of pornography in Turkmenistan is unknown, a law, passed on 1 January 2015, banning citizens to access pornography on the Internet suggests that pornography is definitely illegal in Turkmenistan.\n\nIn 2012, the government in Bangladesh attempted to outlaw pornography as a result of the passing of the Pornography Control Act.\n\nIn India, possession or watching of pornographic materials is completely legal, but distribution of pornography is prohibited and incites several penal provisions. But, enforcement is extremely lax and pornographic materials are easily available in public places. Softcore pornography and hardcore pornography movies/photos are easily accessible through magazines, DVDs, or Internet. Buying and selling sex toys is illegal; nonetheless, sex toys are sold at selected places in India.\n\nPornographic films in India are referred to as Blue Films and are available virtually anywhere; especially in areas where illicit material is already being sold. Despite the illegality, stores selling X-rated material are abundant in major cities, advertising openly and rarely are the laws enforced in this case. In 2010, the Bombay High Court ruled that watching pornography in private is legal.\n\nChild pornography is illegal (\"child\" is defined as a person under 18) to possess, produce (in terms of electronic copies), or to distribute and is labelled as crime. Section 67 of the \"Information Technology Act\" deals with \"publishing obscene information in electronic form\". This law has been interpreted to criminalize posting of pornographic content online. Accessing of \"obscene\" content within one's privacy is legal. The IT Act was amended by the Parliament in 2008, and Section 67B was inserted, which criminalizes browsing, downloading, creation, or publishing of child pornography. Therefore, while it is legal to watch adult porn, it has been made illegal to watch child porn.\n\nOn 1 August 2015 the Government, under the BJP Party, requested ISPs in India to ban 857 pornography sites; however, the ban was lax in nature and pornographic materials from the sites in question could still be easily obtained. The ban was lifted two days later due to widespread protest on social media. Instead, the government plans to focus more attention to blocking sites that host child pornography.\n\nThe production, possession, sale, dissemination, distribution, or importation of pornography or pornographic material (including sex toys) is illegal in Maldives. There were attempts by the government to block pornographic websites. However, it is still accessible in the country as long it is viewed at home.\n\nNepali law identifies pornography as illegal. The sharing, distribution and broadcasting of pornographic content through any medium is prohibited. In 2010 it was reported that the Home Ministry had banned access to a list of websites including explicitly adult websites. In September 2018, concerns about violence against women led the Government of Nepal to announce its intention to ban online pornography. From 24 September, the Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA) began to put a block on all websites providing pornographic content on the orders of the Nepal Government Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (MOCIT). By 12 October more than 21,000 pornographic websites had been blocked.\n\nPornography is illegal. It is not easily accessible, and the Government has put an all-time ban on websites containing such material since November 2011. The list of banned pornographic websites is updated on an ongoing basis.\n\nThe laws against pornography in Sri Lanka are strict. Under the Explicit Literature Ordinance, sale or possession of pornographic material can be classified as illegal. The production of local pornography is strictly illegal.\n\nChild pornography is considered to be illegal under the National Child Protection act and the punishments are very severe. Child pornography possession, production and distribution is punishable by up to 20 years' imprisonment, severe fines and in some cases, even forfeiture of property. This act covers the rights of children, but not pornography per se. Therefore, the same act cannot be used as an anti-pornographic law.\n\nIn the year of 2009, The government banned more than 100 local and international porn sites and nearly 80 Sri Lankan porn stars were arrested by the local authorities. They were all sentenced to fines, community service and prison sentences up to 2 years.\n\nIn Iran pornography is illegal. However, due to widespread Internet access (in particular, downloading programs) and the existence of a large-scale black market in Western films, pornography is called \"super film.\" In Iran, a law was passed in mid-2007 by parliament but still required approval of the Guardian Council, producers of pornographic films face execution if found guilty.\nPornography is legal in Israel. Pornographic films in Israel began to be produced in the 1990s, but most of the films were shot in the early 2000s. Any kind of child pornography is strictly forbidden (under the age of 18).\n\nDistribution of pornography is illegal in Jordan.\n\nIn Lebanon, the production and distribution of pornography films are illegal. Regulation of Internet pornography is relatively light.\n\nIn September 2011, four members of a criminal ring involved in the sale of pornographic films were arrested by Lebanese authorities. The men, of Lebanese and Syrian nationality, had been promoting the sale of unlicensed copies of pornographic DVDs in different areas of the country, particularly Jbeil, north of Beirut, where they were apprehended. The men were referred to the relevant authorities, with the case investigated to uncover the remaining members of the ring and anyone else involved in the distribution of the pornographic films.\n\nIn 2008, Hamas have attempted to implement Internet filters to block access to pornography in the Gaza Strip.\n\nSaudi Arabia prohibits all forms of pornography due to Islam's opposition to it. In 2000 Saudi authorities said that they were \"winning the war against pornography on the internet\".\n\n"}

As with any other culture's humour, its vast scope ranges from lewd jokes and wordplay to political satire.\n\nThe most popular form of Russian humour consists of jokes (анекдо́ты — anekdoty), which are short stories with a punch line. Typical of Russian joke culture is a series of categories with fixed and highly familiar settings and characters. Surprising effects are achieved by an endless variety of plots and plays on words.\n\nJewish humor is a highly developed subset of Russian humor, largely based on the Russian Jews' self-image. These Jewish anecdotes are not the same as anti-Semitic jokes. As some Jews say themselves, Jewish jokes are being made by either anti-Semites or the Jews themselves. Instead, whether told by Jews or non-Jewish Russians, these jokes show cynicism, self-irony, and wit that is characteristic of Jewish humor both in Russia and elsewhere in the world (see Jewish humor). The jokes are usually told with a characteristic Jewish accent (stretching out syllables, parodying the uvular trill of \"R\", etc.) and some peculiarities of sentence structure calqued into Russian from Yiddish. Many of these jokes are set in Odessa, and to some extent the phrase \"Odessa humor\" is synonymous with \"Jewish jokes,\" even if the characters don't have Jewish names and even their religion/ethnicity is never mentioned. To Russians, it is sufficient to begin a joke with: \"So, an Odessan woman gets on the bus...\", and her Jewishness is implicitly understood by the listener.\n\nDrinking toasts can take the form of anecdotes or not-so-short stories, concluded with \"So here's to...\" with a witty punchline referring to the initial story.\n\nA specific form of humour is chastushkas, songs composed of four-line rhymes, usually of lewd, humoristic, or satiric content.\n\nApart from jokes, Russian humour is expressed in word play and short poems including nonsense and black humour verses, similar to some of the macabre \"nursery rhymes\" of Edward Lear.\n\nOften they have recurring characters such as \"little boy\", \"Vova\", \"a girl\", \"Masha\". Most rhymes involve death or a painful experience either for the protagonists or other people. This type of joke is especially popular with children.\n\n\n"}

It is a highly revered ceremony in Newar society of the Kathmandu Valley. The food items served are boiled egg, smoked fish, meat, lentil cake and rice wine which represent Tantric concepts.\n\nThe Sagan is presented during life-cycle events like birthdays, weddings and old-age rites. It is also presented at the Mha Puja ceremony on New Year's Day of Nepal Era. Travellers are given the Sagan before departing on a long journey and upon return from a trip. People who have achieved a special feat or survived a life-threatening accident receive it. The ceremony is also held to honor somebody. The Sagan ritual is performed by both Hindu and Buddhist Newars.\n\nAs per the general practice, the person receiving the Sagan sits cross-legged on the floor, and a Sukunda oil lamp is placed on a large leaf in front and to the right. The eldest woman in the house brings a tray containing flowers, rice and red paste and worships Lord Ganesh, the god of good fortune, on the Sukunda. She then puts a dab of red paste on the forehead of the honoree and others in the room. The participants also take a dab of yogurt from a bowl and put it on the temple.\n\nThe main ritual is performed next. The lady of the house presents a boiled egg and smoked fish which the participants accept with both hands. A woman helper follows pouring rice wine from a jar into little bowls. After everyone has been served, she walks down the line again pouring wine three times into each bowl. She serves wine a third time after which the participants can set down the bowls.\n\nThe procedure and materials may vary as per family tradition and geography. Laddu (sweet balls) or Lāgwah (meat balls) may be presented in place of boiled eggs. Seating may be arranged on the floor or on chairs.\n\nThe Sagan ceremony and the materials used are based on Tantric tradition. The five food items in Sagan represent the five Tantric elements (panchatatwa) – fire or \"agni tatwa\" (symbolized by wine), earth or \"prithvi tatwa\" (meat), water or \"jal tatwa\" (fish), ether or \"akash tatwa\" (lentil cake) and air or \"wayu tatwa\" (egg). The warmth and fire in living beings is provided by fire, and when a being dies, the body becomes the earth, the body contains water, breathe air and exist in ether or space.\n"}
{"id": "67896", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67896", "title": "Space tourism", "text": "Space tourism\n\nSpace tourism is space travel for recreational, leisure or business purposes. There are several different types of space tourism, including orbital, suborbital and lunar space tourism. To date, orbital space tourism has been performed only by the Russian Space Agency. Work also continues towards developing suborbital space tourism vehicles. This is being done by aerospace companies like Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic. In addition, SpaceX (an aerospace manufacturer) announced in 2018 that it is planning on sending two space tourists on a free-return trajectory around the Moon on the upper stage of SpaceX's BFR rocket, known as the Big Falcon Spaceship (BFS).\n\nDuring the period from 2001 to 2009, the publicized price for flights brokered by Space Adventures to the International Space Station aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft was in the range of US$20–40 million. 7 space tourists made 8 space flights during this time. Some space tourists have signed contracts with third parties to conduct certain research activities while in orbit. By 2007, space tourism was thought to be one of the earliest markets that would emerge for commercial spaceflight. Space Adventures is the only company that has sent paying passengers to space. In conjunction with the Federal Space Agency of the Russian Federation and Rocket and Space Corporation Energia, Space Adventures facilitated the flights for all of the world's first private space explorers. The first three participants paid in excess of $20 million (USD) each for their 10-day visit to the ISS.\n\nRussia halted orbital space tourism in 2010 due to the increase in the International Space Station crew size, using the seats for expedition crews that would previously have been sold to paying spaceflight participants. Orbital tourist flights were set to resume in 2015 but the one planned was postponed indefinitely and none have occurred since 2009.\n\nAs an alternative term to \"tourism\", some organizations such as the Commercial Spaceflight Federation use the term \"personal spaceflight\". The Citizens in Space project uses the term \"citizen space exploration\".\n\nMany private space travelers have objected to the term \"space tourist\", often pointing out that their role went beyond that of an observer, since they also carried out scientific experiments in the course of their journey. Richard Garriott additionally emphasized that his training was identical to the requirements of non-Russian Soyuz crew members, and that teachers and other non-professional astronauts chosen to fly with NASA are called astronauts. He has said that if the distinction has to be made, he would rather be called \"private astronaut\" than \"tourist\". Dennis Tito has asked to be known as an \"independent researcher\", and Mark Shuttleworth described himself as a \"pioneer of commercial space travel\". Gregory Olsen prefers \"private researcher\", and Anousheh Ansari prefers the term \"private space explorer\". Other space enthusiasts object to the term on similar grounds. Rick Tumlinson of the Space Frontier Foundation, for example, has said: \"I hate the word tourist, and I always will ... 'Tourist' is somebody in a flowered shirt with three cameras around his neck.\" Russian cosmonaut Maksim Surayev told the press in 2009 not to describe Guy Laliberté as a tourist: \"It's become fashionable to speak of space tourists. He is not a tourist but a participant in the mission.\"\n\n\"Spaceflight participant\" is the official term used by NASA and the Russian Federal Space Agency to distinguish between private space travelers and career astronauts. Tito, Shuttleworth, Olsen, Ansari, and Simonyi were designated as such during their respective space flights. NASA also lists Christa McAuliffe as a spaceflight participant (although she did not pay a fee), apparently due to her non-technical duties aboard the STS-51-L flight.\n\nThe US Federal Aviation Administration awards the title of \"Commercial Astronaut\" to trained crew members of privately funded spacecraft. The only people currently holding this title are Mike Melvill and Brian Binnie, the pilots of SpaceShipOne.\n\nThe Soviet space program was aggressive in broadening the pool of cosmonauts. The Soviet Intercosmos program included cosmonauts selected from Warsaw Pact member countries (Czechoslovakia, Poland, East Germany, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania) and later from allies of the USSR (Cuba, Mongolia, Vietnam) and non-aligned countries (India, Syria, Afghanistan). Most of these cosmonauts received full training for their missions and were treated as equals, but were generally given shorter flights than Soviet cosmonauts. The European Space Agency (ESA) also took advantage of the program.\n\nThe US space shuttle program included payload specialist positions which were usually filled by representatives of companies or institutions managing a specific payload on that mission. These payload specialists did not receive the same training as professional NASA astronauts and were not employed by NASA. In 1983, Ulf Merbold from ESA and Byron Lichtenberg from MIT (engineer and Air Force fighter pilot) were the first payload specialists to fly on the Space Shuttle, on mission STS-9.\n\nIn 1984, Charles D. Walker became the first non-government astronaut to fly, with his employer McDonnell Douglas paying US$40,000 () for his flight. NASA was also eager to prove its capability to Congressional sponsors. During the 1970s, Shuttle prime contractor Rockwell International studied a $200–300 million removable cabin that could fit into the Shuttle's cargo bay. The cabin could carry up to 74 passengers into orbit for up to three days. Space Habitation Design Associates proposed, in 1983, a cabin for 72 passengers in the bay. Passengers were located in six sections, each with windows and its own loading ramp, and with seats in different configurations for launch and landing. Another proposal was based on the Spacelab habitation modules, which provided 32 seats in the payload bay in addition to those in the cockpit area. A 1985 presentation to the National Space Society stated that, although flying tourists in the cabin would cost $1 to 1.5 million per passenger without government subsidy, within 15 years 30,000 people a year would pay US$25,000 () each to fly in space on new spacecraft. The presentation also forecast flights to lunar orbit within 30 years and visits to the lunar surface within 50 years.\n\nAs the shuttle program expanded in the early 1980s, NASA began a Space Flight Participant program to allow citizens without scientific or governmental roles to fly. Christa McAuliffe was chosen as the first Teacher in Space in July 1985 from 11,400 applicants. 1,700 applied for the Journalist in Space program. An Artist in Space program was considered, and NASA expected that after McAuliffe's flight two to three civilians a year would fly on the shuttle. After McAuliffe was killed in the Challenger disaster in January 1986, the programs were canceled. McAuliffe's backup, Barbara Morgan, eventually got hired in 1998 as a professional astronaut and flew on STS-118 as a mission specialist. A second journalist-in-space program, in which NASA green-lighted Miles O'Brien to fly on the space shuttle, was scheduled to be announced in 2003. That program was canceled in the wake of the Columbia disaster on STS-107 and subsequent emphasis on finishing the International Space Station before retiring the space shuttle.\n\nInitially, senior figures at NASA strongly opposed space tourism on principal; from the beginning of the ISS expeditions, NASA stated it wasn't interested in accommodating paying guests. The Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics Committee On Science of the House of Representatives held in June 2001 revealed the shifting attitude of NASA towards paying space tourists wanting to travel to the ISS in its statement on the hearing's purpose: \"Review the issues and opportunities for flying nonprofessional astronauts in space, the appropriate government role for supporting the nascent space tourism industry, use of the Shuttle and Space Station for Tourism, safety and training criteria for space tourists, and the potential commercial market for space tourism.\" The subcommittee report was interested in evaluating Dennis Tito's extensive training and his experience in space as a nonprofessional astronaut.\n\nWith the realities of the post-Perestroika economy in Russia, its space industry was especially starved for cash. The Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS) offered to pay for one of its reporters to fly on a mission. Toyohiro Akiyama was flown in 1990 to Mir with the eighth crew and returned a week later with the seventh crew. Cost estimates vary from $10 million up to $37 million. Akiyama gave a daily TV broadcast from orbit and also performed scientific experiments for Russian and Japanese companies. However, since the cost of the flight was paid by his employer, Akiyama could be considered a business traveler rather than a tourist.\n\nIn 1991, British chemist Helen Sharman was selected from a pool of 13,000 applicants to be the first Briton in space. The program was known as Project Juno and was a cooperative arrangement between the Soviet Union and a group of British companies. The Project Juno consortium failed to raise the funds required, and the program was almost canceled. Reportedly Mikhail Gorbachev ordered it to proceed under Soviet expense in the interests of international relations, but in the absence of Western underwriting, less expensive experiments were substituted for those in the original plans. Sharman flew aboard Soyuz TM-12 to Mir and returned aboard Soyuz TM-11.\n\nAs of 2018, no suborbital space tourism has yet occurred, but since it is projected to be more affordable, many companies view it as a money-making proposition. Most are proposing vehicles that make suborbital flights peaking at an altitude of . Passengers would experience three to six minutes of weightlessness, a view of a twinkle-free starfield, and a vista of the curved Earth below. Projected costs are expected to be about $200,000 per passenger.\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of the 1990s, MirCorp, a private venture that was by then in charge of the space station, began seeking potential space tourists to visit Mir in order to offset some of its maintenance costs. Dennis Tito, an American businessman and former JPL scientist, became their first candidate. When the decision was made to de-orbit Mir, Tito managed to switch his trip to the International Space Station (ISS) through a deal between MirCorp and US-based Space Adventures, Ltd. Dennis Tito visited the ISS for seven days in April-May 2001, becoming the world's first \"fee-paying\" space tourist.\n\nTito was followed in April 2002 by South African Mark Shuttleworth (Soyuz TM-34). The third was Gregory Olsen in October 2005 (Soyuz TMA-7). In February 2003, the Space Shuttle Columbia disintegrated on re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, killing all seven astronauts aboard. After this disaster, space tourism on the Russian Soyuz program was temporarily put on hold, because Soyuz vehicles became the only available transport to the ISS. After the Shuttle return to service in July 2005, space tourism was resumed. In September 2006, an Iranian American businesswoman named Anousheh Ansari became the fourth space tourist (Soyuz TMA-9).) In April 2007, Charles Simonyi, an American businessman of Hungarian descent, joined their ranks (Soyuz TMA-10). Simonyi became the first repeat space tourist, paying again to fly on Soyuz TMA-14 in March 2009. British-American Richard Garriott became the next space tourist in October 2008 aboard Soyuz TMA-14. As of 2018, Canadian Guy Laliberté is the most recent tourism to fly to the ISS, in September 2009 aboard Soyuz TMA-16. Since the Space Shuttle was retired in 2011, Soyuz once again became the only means of accessing the ISS, and so tourism was once again put on hold.\n\nBigelow Aerospace acquired the designs for inflatable space habitats from NASA's Transhab program, and has already launched two first inflatable habitat modules. The first, named Genesis I, was launched in July 2006, and the second test module, Genesis II, was launched in June 2007. Both Genesis habitats remain in orbit as of 2018. \n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the Outer Space Treaty signed in 1967, the launch operator's nationality and the launch site's location determine which country is responsible for any damages occurred from a launch.\n\nAfter valuable resources were detected on the Moon, private companies began to formulate methods to extract the resources. Article II of the Outer Space Treaty dictates that \"outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means\". However, countries have the right to freely explore the Moon and any resources collected are property of that country when they return.\n\nIn December 2005, the US government released a set of proposed rules for space tourism. These included screening procedures and training for emergency situations, but not health requirements.\n\nUnder current US law, any company proposing to launch paying passengers from American soil on a suborbital rocket must receive a license from the Federal Aviation Administration's Office of Commercial Space Transportation (FAA/AST). The licensing process focuses on public safety and safety of property, and the details can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 14, Chapter III. This is in accordance with the Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act passed by Congress in 2004.\n\nIn March 2010, the New Mexico legislature passed the Spaceflight Informed Consent Act. The SICA gives legal protection to companies who provide private space flights in the case of accidental harm or death to individuals. Participants sign an Informed Consent waiver, dictating that spaceflight operators cannot be held liable in the \"death of a participant resulting from the inherent risks of space flight activities\". Operators are however not covered in the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct.\n\nA web-based survey suggested that over 70% of those surveyed wanted less than or equal to 2 weeks in space; in addition, 88% wanted to spacewalk (only 14% of these would do it for a 50% premium), and 21% wanted a hotel or space station.\n\nThe concept has met with some criticism from some, including politicians, notably Günter Verheugen, vice-president of the European Commission, who said of the EADS Astrium Space Tourism Project: \"It's only for the super-rich, which is against my social convictions\".\n\nA 2010 study published in \"Geophysical Research Letters\" raised concerns that the growing commercial spaceflight industry could accelerate global warming. The study, funded by NASA and The Aerospace Corporation, simulated the impact of 1,000 suborbital launches of hybrid rockets from a single location, calculating that this would release a total of 600 tonnes of black carbon into the stratosphere. They found that the resultant layer of soot particles remained relatively localized, with only 20% of the carbon straying into the southern hemisphere, thus creating a strong hemispherical asymmetry. This unbalance would cause the temperature to decrease by about in the tropics and subtropics, whereas the temperature at the poles would increase by between . The ozone layer would also be affected, with the tropics losing up to 1.7% of ozone cover, and the polar regions gaining 5–6%. The researchers stressed that these results should not be taken as \"a precise forecast of the climate response to a specific launch rate of a specific rocket type\", but as a demonstration of the sensitivity of the atmosphere to the large-scale disruption that commercial space tourism could bring.\n\nSeveral organizations have been formed to promote the space tourism industry, including the Space Tourism Society, Space Future, and HobbySpace. \"UniGalactic Space Travel Magazine\" is a bi-monthly educational publication covering space tourism and space exploration developments in companies like SpaceX, Orbital Sciences, Virgin Galactic and organizations like NASA.\n\nClasses in space tourism are currently taught at the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York, and Keio University in Japan.\n\nA 2010 report from the Federal Aviation Administration, titled \"The Economic Impact of Commercial Space Transportation on the U. S Economy in 2009\", cites studies done by Futron, an aerospace and technology-consulting firm, which predict that space tourism could become a billion-dollar market within 20 years. In addition, in the nearly two decades since Dennis Tito journeyed to the International Space Station, eight private citizens have paid the $20 million fee to travel to space. Space Adventures suggests that this number could increase fifteen-fold by 2020. These figures do not include other private space agencies such as Virgin Galactic, which as of 2014 has sold approximately 700 tickets priced at $200,000 or $250,000 dollars each and has accepted more than $80 million in deposits.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2148553", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2148553", "title": "Viennese coffee house", "text": "Viennese coffee house\n\nThe Viennese coffee house (, ) is a typical institution of Vienna that played an important part in shaping Viennese culture.\n\nSince October 2011 the \"Viennese Coffee House Culture\" is listed as \"Intangible Cultural Heritage\" in the Austrian inventory of the \"National Agency for the Intangible Cultural Heritage\", a part of UNESCO. The Viennese coffee house is described in this inventory as a place \"where time and space are consumed, but only the coffee is found on the bill.\"\n\nThe social practices, the rituals, the elegance create the very specific atmosphere of the Viennese café. Coffee Houses entice with a wide variety of coffee drinks, international newspapers, and pastry creations. Typical for Viennese Coffee Houses are marble tabletops, Thonet chairs, newspaper tables and interior design details in the style of Historicism. The Austrian writer Stefan Zweig described the Viennese Coffee House as an institution of a special kind, \"actually a sort of democratic club, open to everyone for the price of a cheap cup of coffee, where every guest can sit for hours with this little offering, to talk, write, play cards, receive post, and above all consume an unlimited number of newspapers and journals.\" Zweig in fact attributed a good measure of Vienna's cosmopolitan air to the rich daily diet of current and international information offered in the coffee houses.\n\nIn many classic cafés (for example Café Central and Café Prückel) piano music is played in the evening and social events like literary readings are held. In warmer months, customers can often sit outside in a Schanigarten. Almost all coffee houses provide small food dishes like sausages as well as desserts, cakes and tarts, like Apfelstrudel, Millirahmstrudel, Punschkrapfen and Linzer torte.\n\nUnlike some other café traditions around the world, it is completely normal for a customer to linger alone for hours and study the omnipresent newspaper. Along with coffee, the waiter will serve an obligatory glass of cold tap water and during a long stay will often bring additional water unrequested, with the idea to serve the guest with an exemplary sense of attention.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, leading writers of the time became attached to the atmosphere of Viennese cafés and were frequently seen to meet, exchange and to even write there. Literature composed in cafés is commonly referred to as coffee house literature, the writers thereof as coffee house poets. The famous journal \"Die Fackel\" (\"The Torch\") by Karl Kraus is said to have been written in cafés to a large extent. Other coffee house poets include Arthur Schnitzler, Alfred Polgar, Friedrich Torberg, and Egon Erwin Kisch. Famous writer and poet Peter Altenberg even had his mail delivered to his favorite café, the Café Central.\n\nLegend has it that soldiers of the Polish-Habsburg army, while liberating Vienna from the second Turkish siege in 1683, found a number of sacks with strange beans that they initially thought were camel feed and wanted to burn. The Polish king Jan III Sobieski granted the sacks to one of his officers named Jerzy Franciszek Kulczycki, who started the first coffee house. This story was published by the Catholic Priest Gottfried Uhlich in 1783 in his \"History of the second Turkish Siege\", and he took some liberties. In reality, Kulczycki's coffee house missed being the first by more than a year. A more factual account has been reported by Karl Teply.\n\nAfter some experimentation, the legend goes on, Kulczycki added some sugar and milk, and the Viennese coffee tradition was born. This achievement has been recognized in many modern Viennese coffeehouses by hanging a picture of Kulczycki in the window. Another account is that Kulczycki, having spent two years in Ottoman captivity, knew perfectly well what coffee really was and tricked his superiors into granting him the beans that were considered worthless.\n\nAccording to recent research, Vienna's first coffee house was in fact opened by an Armenian businessman named Johannes Diodato in 1685. 15 years later, four Greek owned coffeehouses had the privilege to serve coffee.\n\nThe new drink was well received, and coffee houses began to pop up rapidly. In the early period, the various drinks had no names, and customers would select the mixtures from a colour-shaded chart.\n\nThe heyday of the coffee house was the turn of the nineteenth century when writers like Peter Altenberg, Alfred Polgar, Karl Kraus, Hermann Broch and Friedrich Torberg made them their preferred place of work and pleasure. Many famous artists, scientists, and politicians of the period such as Arthur Schnitzler, Stefan Zweig, Egon Schiele, Gustav Klimt, Adolf Loos, Theodor Herzl, Alfred Adler, and even Leon Trotsky were constant coffee house patrons. In Prague, Budapest, Krakow, and Lviv and other cities of the Austro-Hungarian empire there were also many coffee houses according to the Viennese model.\n\nIn the 1950s, the period of \"coffee house death\" began, as many famous Viennese coffee houses had to close. This was due to the popularity of television and the appearance of modern espresso bars. Nevertheless, many of these classic Viennese coffee houses still exist. A renewed interest in their tradition and tourism have prompted a comeback. Some relatively modern Viennese coffee houses have emerged in North America, such as Julius Meinl Chicago and Kaffeehaus de Chatillon in greater Seattle and Cafe Sabarsky in Manhattan.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "29450481", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29450481", "title": "Vox in Rama", "text": "Vox in Rama\n\nVox in Rama () is a papal bull issued by Pope Gregory IX in either 1232, 1233 or 1234 condemning a German heresy known as \"Luciferian\", a form of devil worship. The bull was issued to King Henry, son of Emperor Frederick II, in June 1233 and subsequently to Archbishop Siegfried III of Mainz demanding they use all efforts to stop the practice.\n\nThe 13th century was a time of great superstition and saw the start of the \"demonisation of heretics\" by the Church, attributing their lack of belief in the Catholic faith to the devil. Barber claims that it was during this time that there was a great zeal for the sending out of inquisitors by the pope and local bishops with the aim of seeking out potential heretics. In 1233, Konrad von Marburg (sometimes anglicized as Conrad of Marburg) began an inquisition in Mainz at the behest of either the Pope or the archbishop.\n\nAllegedly through torture and terror, Konrad reported he had uncovered a satanic cult which worshiped devils in the forms of a demonic man and of a diabolical black cat. The inquisition of Konrad was controversial: shortly after Konrad arrived in Mainz, a papal official called Bernard wrote to Gregory stating that Konrad had been forcing innocent people to confess by threatening them with burning at the stake if they refused to do so. Shortly thereafter, Konrad was assassinated, possibly by the servants of Henry II, Count of Sayn, whom Konrad had accused of fostering heresy.\n\nThe issue of the bull was a response to Konrad's allegations, urging Siegfried III and King Henry, representing the ecclesiastical and temporal authorities respectively, to seek out and destroy the heretics.\n\nThe bull describes in detail the initiation rites of the sect, claiming that the potential initiate is first approached by a mysterious toad as large as a dog. Shortly afterwards an emaciated pale man would appear, whom the initiate would kiss and thereby forget all memory of the Catholic faith. Members of the sect would then meet for a meal. When the meal had ended, the sect would arise and a statue of a black cat would come to life, walking backwards with its tail erect. First the new initiate and then the master of the sect would kiss the cat on the buttocks.\n\nAfter the ritual was completed, the bull claims that the candles in the room would be extinguished and the sect would engage in wild orgies which were sometimes homosexual in nature. Once the candles are re-lit, a man from a dark corner of the room “comes forth from the loins upward, shining like the sun. His lower part is shaggy like a cat.” After a brief litany-like dialogue between the cat and the cult members, the meeting ends.\n\nGregory also claims that the sect committed various crimes against the Eucharist:\n\nIn conclusion, Gregory condemns the practice and calls upon the religious and secular authorities in the diocese to take action against the cult's participants.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "35595838", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35595838", "title": "Wursten Frisian", "text": "Wursten Frisian\n\nWursten Frisian was a dialect of the East Frisian language that is thought to have been spoken until the early 18th century in the landscape of Wursten between Bremerhaven and Cuxhaven, Germany. Together with Harlingen Frisian and Wangerooge Frisian it belonged to the Weser Frisian group of dialects. The last East Frisian dialect still spoken today is Saterland Frisian, an Ems group dialect.\n\nThe Wursten landscape was not part of the original settling area of the Frisians but was eventually colonised by them in the 8th century A.D. and became an independent municipality. When the East Frisian language began to fade in the 15th century it was successively replaced by West Low German dialects in the area between the rivers Lauwers and Weser. In Wursten however, the East Frisian language was upheld slightly longer than in East Frisia proper and in Ommelanden which is now a part of the Netherlands.\n\nAt the end of the 17th century the Wursten dialect was described in two lists of words but at the time it had strongly come under pressure. It is believed that in the first half of the 18th century, the Wursten dialect had as well become extinct.\n\nThe Weser dialects of the East Frisian language were unique among the Germanic languages as they kept full vowels in secondary syllables. This phenomenon was especially distinctive in the Wursten Frisian, the easternmost of the East Frisian dialects. In Old Frisian words with a short stem vowel the accentuation shifted from the first to the second syllable. Thus it could happen that not only the full vowel was preserved in what was now a stressed secondary syllable but the old stem vowel was partially reduced to a total loss. This transition process created words like \"snuh\" (son, from Old Frisian \"sunu\") or \"kma\" (to come, from Old Fr. \"koma\").\n\nThe only preserved full sentence in Wursten Frisian reads: \"Kma wit hart ick will di wit tell\" [Come here, I want to tell you something].\n\nToday, there are still some substratum words of Wursten Frisian in the Low German dialect of the Wursten landscape. Århammar lists \"Maon\" (socage), \"Bau(d)n\" (horse-fly), \"Schuur/Schuulschotten\" (dragonfly) and \"jill'n\" (to shriek) as examples. Nothing remains however of the phonological characteristics of Wursten Frisian.\n\n"}
