{"id": "25168463", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25168463", "title": "Amjad Jaimoukha", "text": "Amjad Jaimoukha\n\nAmjad Jaimoukha (Circassian: Жэмыхъуэ Амджэд, ; sometimes quoted as \"Амыщ\", the Circassian personal name) wrote a number of books on North Caucasian – specifically Circassian and Chechen – culture and folklore. According to the \"Circassian Encyclopaedia\" \"Jaimoukha is perhaps the most important writer on Circassian issues\". He was considered one of the most influential Circassian writers and publicists in the last decade. In particular, he was active in promoting and assisting a new crop of Circassian and non-Circassian writers working on raising the profile of Caucasian issues at the global level.\n\n\nJaimoukha published with the following Western publishing houses: Routledge [RoutledgeCurzon], Curzon, Bennett and Bloom, Palgrave (Macmillan) [St. Martin's Press], L'Harmattan. He also worked with Sanjalay Press and the International Centre for Circassian Studies.\n\nJaimoukha was director of the International Centre for Circassian Studies (ICCS), an institute specialising in the dissemination of Circassian culture and folklore. The Centre is the brainchild of the famous Circassian writer and film producer and director Mohydeen Quandour. The principal aim of the Centre is the development and dissemination of Circassian literature, culture and folklore. There is a particular emphasis on boosting the status of Circassian and to promote its teaching and use. The Centre publishes a bilingual journal (in Circassian and English) \"The Hearth Tree\". The publications of the Centre can be accessed via its website .\n\nJaimoukha devised a Latin orthography for Kabardian (Eastern Circassian) that is characterised by relative simplicity (considering the complexity of the language). An advantage of this system is that it has a one-to-one correspondence with the current Cyrillic orthography used for Kabardian, and already a software has been designed to render one orthography into the other, making it possible to turn works already published in Cyrillic Kabardian into the new orthography, and vice versa, facilitating transition from one system to the other.\n\nJaimoukha previously held the position of Assistant President of the Royal Scientific Society (RSS) in the period 2003-2007. He published a number of studies and bibliographic tomes during his tenure at RSS, including \"Scientific Integrity\", \"Intellectual Capital Report\", and \"Bibliography of the Publications of the Royal Scientific Society\".\n\nJaimoukha was a strong advocate of the revival of all aspects of Circassian culture and folklore, including obsolete and defunct genres of art and culture. He wrote a number of books and articles in journals and newspapers championing the raising of the status of the Circassian language in both the Circassian republics in the Northwest Caucasus (where about one million Circassians live) and in the diaspora (principally in Turkey, Syria, Jordan, Egypt, Iraq, US, Germany, France, and the Netherlands), where some 5 million descendants of the 19th-century Circassian forced immigrants reside. The ultimate survival of the Circassian language and culture is intimately associated with the political fate of the Circassians in the Caucasus and the re-establishment of Circassia as a viable state, recognised as a full member of the comity of nations. The unification of the Kabardians, Cherkess, Adigeans, and Shapsugh in the Northwest Caucasus in the political and cultural spheres is a requisite step towards enhanced autonomy. Jaimoukha was among the vocal Circassians actively engaged in raising awareness of Circassian issues amongst the Circassians themselves and at a global level. He planned to publish a book on the controversial issue of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, to be held in Circassia.\n\nJaimoukha was a proponent of North Caucasian unity and independence (from Daghestan in the east to Abkhazia in the west). He advocated Circassian independence on a number of media outlets. He referred to the historical lands of the Circassians as \"Circassia\". Despite the linguistic diversity, the peoples of the North Caucasus share similar traditions, beliefs and culture. His work \"Thoughts on North Caucasian Federation\" maps a plan of unification of the western part of the region (the historical lands of the Circassians (Adiga), Abkhaz-Abaza [Apswa] and the Ubykh). According to this scheme, the Adiga entities (perhaps with the inclusion of the Abaza) would be united into one independent state that might eventually opt to enter into federative arrangements with the already independent Abkhaz and the Karachai-Balkar state. This would remove the artificial tensions that might flare up into open conflict between the Kabardians and Balkar in Kabardino-Balkaria and the Karachai and Cherkess in the Karachay–Cherkess Republic. The Adigeans would become more secure and more resistant to the Russian drive to undo their fragile republic. It would seem that the logical (interim) step of uniting the Kabardians and Cherkess into one autonomous entity on the one hand and the Karachai and Balkar into another, on the other, is considered taboo by the authorities in the two republics.\n\nPrincipal literary collaborations included work with Nicholas Awde, the editor of the Caucasus World series published by Routledge and co-owner of the publishing house Bennett and Bloom, JonArno Lawson, the writer of a number of fantastic books, and Michel Malherbe, the prolific writer and editor of the \"Parlons...\" series published by the French publishing house L'Harmattan. A work on the Adigean dialect of Circassian was scheduled to be published by L'Harmattan in 2010. Jaimoukha contributed five articles (on the Circassians, Kabardians, Karachai, Dagestanis, and Jordan) in Carl Skutsche's seminal three-volume work \"Encyclopedia of the World's Minorities\" , published by Routledge in 2004 in New York.\n\nThere was a close co-operation with the Circassian writer Luba Belaghi (Balagova; publications in Circassian and Russian) in the framework of the publications of the International Centre for Circassian Studies.\n\n\n"}

In addition to language a myth could be represented by a painting, a sculpture or a building.\n\nIt is about the overall story of an architectural work, often revealed through art. Not all stories surrounding an architectural work incorporate a level of myth. These stories can also be well hidden to the casual viewer and are often built into the conceptual design of the architectural statement.\n\nBefore 600 BC worship was done in the open. But when the Greeks began to represent their Gods by large statues, it was necessary to provide a building for this purpose. This led to the development of temples.\n\nThe ancient Greek temples were often enhanced with mythological decorations from the columns to the roof. The architectural functions of the temple mainly concentrated on the cella with the cult statue. The architectural elaboration served to stress the dignity of the cella.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "48315392", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48315392", "title": "Article structure", "text": "Article structure\n\nNews stories and features, whether in magazine writing or broadcast news, can be categorized in terms of article structures that define the order in which information is introduced to the story. Some writers deny consciously organizing articles according to specific structures, but may use them to describe the writing \"post hoc\". Others recognize a style within a developing story and use it to develop the narrative. Still others may be required to pursue a specific style from the beginning by publisher guidelines.\n\nSome of the structure types include:\n\nThe inverted pyramid structure begins with the latest or most important developments, then provides greater description and detail, tapering off with less significant events of relevance. Proponents of this structure, which is common in news reporting, may criticize other styles as \"burying the lead,\" though others criticize it as a dull style that \"tells the joke by starting at the punch line.\" Because this structure is designed to permit truncation by an editor, authors do not need to plan a specific ending as they might with other styles.\n\nA narrative structure is a straightforward, chronological description of events. For example, an article about a set of Murders may begin with the discovery of the first victim and end with the imprisonment or execution of a suspect.\n\nThe hourglass structure is a combination of inverted pyramid and narrative structures. The author begins with key details (who, what, when, where, and why), and adds details of increasingly lower importance as in the inverted pyramid structure. The story then abruptly \"turns,\" requiring a clear transition, to focus on a narrative, such as the story of a specific eyewitness or party, which addresses finer details and implications, before making its final conclusion. Like the inverted pyramid, it attempts to satisfy readers who don't complete the article, while continuing to engage readers with greater interest. In broadcast news reporting, the narrative portion may be provided by a reporter on the scene, while the beginning and end are told by an anchor at the studio. The simple narrative portion may be convenient for reporters writing under a deadline.\n\nAn article may begin with an anecdotal \"hook\" to catch the reader's attention. This is followed by a \"nut graph\" paragraph that summarizes the story as a whole. Body paragraphs then explore these ideas in greater detail, provide useful background, or explain conflicting opinions.\n\nThe diamond structure is similar to a nut graph, with anecdotal hook, nut graph, and a wealth of general detail, but then progressively narrows these issues and applies them to the anecdote introduced in the hook. The story may be considered as a \"quest\" to understand the situation of a single individual. A journalism class may require this structure for an opinion story.\n\nThe \"Christmas tree\" shape of this story broadens out from the introduction and a series of internal turning points or surprises within the narrative, before coming to a final conclusion. For example, the subject may be revealed to (a)HIV, (b) be unresponsive to existing drugs, (c) learn of an experimental study, but (d) doesn't know if it will work. Each of these turning points provides the basis for further development of the story.\n\nThe organic structure, as expounded by Jon Franklin, is composed at its most basic level of visual imagery that provides a cinematic feel. These are linked into \"foci\" that detail an action, which are in turn linked by \"transitions in time, mood, subject and character.\" A typical sequence of foci may be complication, development, and resolution.\n\nCredited to Rick Bragg, the \"five boxes\" of this structure are a standard progression: A hook that attracts the reader's attention with a specific image or detail; a nut graph summary; a second lead that introduces remaining facts; details of secondary importance; and a \"kicker:\" a strong image, comment, or quotation that provides a strong conclusion.\n\n"}
{"id": "33693638", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33693638", "title": "Battlefield 4", "text": "Battlefield 4\n\nBattlefield 4 is a first-person shooter video game developed by video game developer EA DICE and published by Electronic Arts. It is a sequel to 2011's \"Battlefield 3\" and was released in October 2013 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360; then later in November for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.\n\n\"Battlefield 4\" was met with positive reception. It was praised for its multiplayer mode, gameplay and graphics, but was also criticized for its short and shallow single-player campaign mode, and for its numerous bugs and glitches. It was a commercial success, selling over 7 million copies.\nThe game's heads-up display (HUD) is composed of two compact rectangles. The lower left-hand corner features a mini-map and compass for navigation, and a simplified objective notice above it; the lower right includes a compact ammo counter and health meter. The top right displays kill notifications of all players in-game. On the Windows version of the game, the top left features a chat window when in multiplayer. The mini-map, as well as the main game screen, shows symbols denoting three kinds of entities: blue for allies, green for squadmates, and orange for enemies, this applies to all interactivity on the battlefield. Battlefield 4 options also allow colour-blind players to change the on-screen colour indicators to: tritanomaly, deuteranomaly and protanomaly.\n\nWeapon customisation is expansive and encouraged. Primary, secondary and melee weapons can all be customised with weapon attachments and camouflage 'skins'. Most weapons also have a default setting for different firing modes (e.g. semi-automatic, automatic fire), allowing the player to adapt to the environment they find themselves in. They can \"spot\" targets (marking their positions to the player's team) in the single-player campaign (a first in the Battlefield franchise) as well as in multiplayer. The game's bullet-dropping-system has been significantly enhanced, forcing the player to change the way they play medium to long distance combat. In addition, players have more combat capabilities, such as countering melee attacks from the front while standing or crouching, shooting with their sidearm while swimming, and diving underwater to avoid enemy detection. Standard combat abilities are still current including, reloading whilst sprinting, unlimited sprint, prone and vaulting.\n\nThe single-player campaign has several differences from the main multiplayer component. For the most part, the player must traverse mini-sandbox-style levels, in some cases using vehicles, like tanks and boats, to traverse the environment. As the player character, Recker, the player can use two campaign-only functions: the Engage command and the tactical binocular. The Engage command directs Recker's squadmates, and occasionally other friendly units, to attack any hostiles in Recker's line of sight. The tactical binocular is similar to a laser-designator, in the sense that it allows the player to identify friendly and enemy units, weapon stashes, explosives, and objectives in the field. By identifying enemies, the player can make them visible without using the visor, making them easier to mark for their teammates. At one point, Recker will briefly lose the tactical visor, forcing them to only use the Engage command to direct his squadmates on a limited number of enemies.\n\nThe campaign features assignments that require specific actions and unlock weapons for use in multiplayer upon completion. Collectible weapons return along with the introduction of collectible dog tags which can be used in multiplayer. Weapon crates are found throughout all levels, allowing players to obtain ammo and switch weapons. While crates hold default weapons, collectible weapons may be used whenever they are acquired and level-specific weapons may be used once a specific mission assignment has been completed by obtaining enough points in a level.\n\n\"Battlefield 4\"s multiplayer contains three playable factions—the United States, China, and Russia—fighting against each other, in up to 64-player matches on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One (24-Player on Xbox 360 and PS3). A newly reintroduced \"Commander Mode\", last seen in \"Battlefield 2142\", gives one player on each team a real-time strategy-like view of the entire map and the ability to give orders to teammates. Also, the Commander can observe the battle through the eyes of the players on the battlefield, deploying vehicle and weapon drops to \"keep the war machinery going\", and order in missile strikes on hostile targets. A spectator mode is included, enabling players to spectate others in first or third person, as well as use a free camera to pan around the map from any angle.\n\nOn June 10, 2013, at E3, DICE featured the map \"Siege of Shanghai\", pitting the People's Liberation Army against the U.S. Marine Corps. The gameplay showcased Commander Mode; new weapons and vehicles; and the \"Levolution\" gameplay mechanic. The video displays the last of these at various points, including: a player destroying a support pillar to trap an enemy tank above it; and a large skyscraper (with an in-game objective on the top floor) collapsing in the center of the map, kicking up a massive dust cloud throughout the map and bringing the objective closer to ground level. Levolution also includes effects such as shooting a fire extinguisher to fill the room with obscuring clouds, car alarms going off when stepped on, metal detectors going off once passed through, or cutting the power in a room to reduce others' visibility.\n\nThe maps included in the main game are \"Siege of Shanghai\", \"Paracel Storm\", \"Zavod 311\", \"Lancang Dam\", \"Flood Zone\", \"Rogue Transmission\", \"Hainan Resort\", \"Dawnbreaker\", \"Operation Locker\" and \"Golmud Railway\". The game modes on offer include \"Battlefield\"s Conquest, Domination and Rush; while adding two new game modes called Obliteration and Defuse, along with traditional game modes such as Team Deathmatch and Squad Deathmatch.\n\nThe four kits from \"Battlefield 3\" are present in \"Battlefield 4\" with minor tweaks. The Assault kit must now wait for the defibrillator to recharge after reviving teammates in quick succession. The Engineer kit uses PDWs, and carbines are available to all kits. The support kit has access to the new remote mortar and the XM25 allowing for indirect suppressive fire. The Recon kit is now more mobile and is able to equip carbines, designated marksman rifles (DMRs), and C4. Sniping mechanics also give with the ability to zero in your sights (set an aiming distance), and equip more optics and accessories than previous Battlefield games. The Recon kit is still able to utilize the MAV, T-UGS, and the Radio Beacon.\n\nNew vehicles have also been introduced. With the addition of the Chinese faction, new vehicles include the Type 99 MBT, the ZFB-05 armored car, and the Z-10W attack helicopter. Jets have also been rebalanced and put into two classes, \"attack\" and \"stealth\". The attack jets focus is mainly air-to-ground capabilities, while stealth jets focus mainly on air-to-air combat. Another vehicle added in \"Battlefield 4\" is the addition of the RCB and DV-15 Interceptor attack boats, which function as heavily armed aquatic assault craft.\n\nCustomization options have also been increased in \"Battlefield 4\", with all new camos available for every gun. A new \"adaptive\" camo has been introduced that can adapt the camo to the map being played without the player having to change camos every map. Camos can now be applied to jets, helicopters, tanks, transport vehicles and guns. Previously this option was introduced to parachutes but has been removed, emblems are now printed onto parachutes.\n\n\"Battlefield 4\"s single-player Campaign takes place during the fictional \"War of 2020\", six years after the events of its predecessor. Tensions between Russia and the United States have been running at a record high, due to a conflict between the two countries that has been running for the last six years. On top of this, China is also on the brink of war, as Admiral Chang, the main antagonist, plans to overthrow China's current government. If he succeeds, Chang will have full support from the Russians, helping spark war between China and the United States.\n\nThe player controls Sgt. Daniel \"Reck\" Recker, second-in-command of a U.S. Marine Corps squad callsigned \"Tombstone\". His squadmates include squad leader SSgt. William Dunn, Heavy Weapon Specialist SSgt. Kimble \"Irish\" Graves, and field medic Sgt. Clayton \"Pac\" Pakowski. Early in the Campaign, Tombstone is joined by CIA operative Laszlo W. Kovic, originally known as \"Agent W.\" from \"Battlefield 3\"s Campaign; and Chinese Secret Service agent Huang \"Hannah\" Shuyi. The Campaign also sees the return of Dimitri \"Dima\" Mayakovsky from \"Battlefield 3\"s Campaign—still alive after the nuclear detonation in Paris six years ago, and under the Chinese military's custody for unknown reasons.\n\nSet in 2020, six years after the events in New York, \"Battlefield 4\"s Campaign primarily follows chronological order, and permanently casts the player as Recker. In the beginning, set in Baku, Azerbaijan, Tombstone Squad—consisting of Recker, Dunn, Irish, and Pac—escapes the city, with vital intelligence in hand and Russian special forces in hot pursuit. The ensuing chase sees the squad trapped in a car plunging into the sea. Dunn, trapped between the seats and already critically wounded, gives Recker his revolver and orders him to shoot out the windshield. Reluctantly, Recker shoots the window, and Dunn drowns as the others escape. As Tombstone swims to the surface, the player hears their commanding officer, Captain Garrison, talking over the phone about the intel: that Admiral Chang is planning a military \"coup d'état\", and if he succeeds, he will gain full Russian support, confirming an earlier report from an asset in China. Tombstone returns to the USS \"Valkyrie\", a Wasp-class amphibious assault ship \"en route\" to China's eastern coast. On board, Garrison informs them of the assassination of Chinese presidential candidate Jin Jié, and that Chang convinced the Chinese that the United States was responsible.\n\nGarrison sends Tombstone, with Recker as squad leader, on a covert mission in Shanghai to rescue three VIPs: Kovic, Hannah, and Hannah's husband. With Tombstone's help, Kovic takes his fellow VIPs to the \"Valkyrie\" by helicopter. Meanwhile, Tombstone takes a civilian tourist boat from the shore, just as an electromagnetic pulse fries all electric equipment in the area. Realizing that there are other civilian refugees stranded on boats around them, and against Pac's protests, Irish leads them to the \"Valkyrie\". Aboard the \"Valkyrie\", they head for the USS \"Titan\", a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier that can assist them. Upon sighting the \"Titan\", the \"Valkyrie\" finds it critically damaged by Chang's forces. Garrison orders Tombstone, with Kovic as acting squad leader to scour the wreckage of the \"Titan\" for the vital ships voyage data recorder before it sinks. Tombstone recovers a hard drive with data from before the Chinese missile attack and fight their way out against boarding Chinese soldiers. The \"Titan\" buckles under its own weight while sinking and splits in two, forcing Tombstone to jump ship. Making their way back to the \"Valkyrie\" with a hijacked assault boat, they find the carrier under siege by Chinese forces. They board it to repel the Chinese assault. Kovic is critically injured during the engagement, and puts Recker back in charge of Tombstone before he dies. Tombstone then clears the bridge and rescues Hannah's husband and Garrison.\n\nGarrison briefs Recker and Pac on the upcoming assault on the Chinese-controlled Singapore airfield to destroy Chinese air superiority while their air forces are grounded by a storm. Hannah volunteers to join Tombstone, much to Irish's chagrin, as he wasn't involved in the briefing himself. The Marines successfully assault the beach and lead an advance towards the airfield, losing most of their forces in the process. While crossing a bridge to the airfield, Recker is pinned behind by a car blown by the strong winds and tries to break free with the help of Tombstone, to no avail. A large freighter crashes into the bridge, throwing Tombstone into the sea below. They survive and make their way to the airfield via a sewer. After Pac fires the signal flare, Tombstone attempts to evacuate the area using an enemy vehicle, but they are knocked out of their vehicle when the missiles hit, apparently killing Pac. Hannah seemingly betrays the squad, bringing the Chinese soldiers to capture Tombstone; this infuriates Irish, but neither he nor Recker can stop the soldiers from incapacitating them.\n\nRecker and Irish are then taken to a prison in the Kunlun Mountains by the Chinese military. There, the two Marines are interrogated about their mission in Shanghai, with Chang personally watching, before being thrown into cells. Recker is awoken by \"Dima\", a Russian prisoner suffering from radiation poisoning. Recker helps Dima release the other prisoners, starting a mass riot throughout the prison and reuniting him with Irish. Although the prison guard is overrun, Chinese military arrives and launch an assault. Recker and Irish hold them off long enough for Dima to open the prison gates, only to be caught by Hannah and other soldiers. Hannah shoots the soldiers holding Recker, Irish and Dima at gunpoint; she explains that she had been tasked to protect Jin Jié, who had been posing as her husband. The group fights their way through the Kunlun Mountains to a cable car, which goes down the mountain. The tram is then shot down by an enemy helicopter, and the impact kills Dima.\n\nForced to continue on foot for two days, Tombstone makes their way down the mountain, forced to hunt for food to survive. They find a jeep and drive to Tashgar, a city in Western China with a US military presence, under siege by Russian forces. While driving, Hannah explains that she'd brought Jin Jié to meet her family to give them hope, but that the next day, Chang's army came and killed them all; this mortifies Irish, and he apologizes to Hannah. They eventually find Major Greenland, who commands the remainder of U.S. ground forces in Tashgar. She states that the mobile anti-air that the Russians have are causing them to have a disadvantage. Tombstone volunteers to demolish the dam to flood the area, destroying the Chinese-Russian forces in exchange for a ride back to the \"Valkyrie\". They successfully complete their task, and are sent to the Suez Canal.\n\nThey are picked up by a U.S. C-130 using the Fulton surface-to-air recovery system, and are then paradropped to the \"Valkyrie\", which is sailing blindly into Admiral Chang's forces. Tombstone clears the deck of boarding Chinese forces and finds Garrison, who is holed up in a medical bay with Jin Jié, other survivors, and Pac (who had survived Singapore.) When Chinese forces reach the door to the medical bay, Jin Jié convinces Recker to let him show his face to the soldiers, as they had been fighting under the illusion that Jin Jié had been killed. Recker opens the door and is knocked down, but Jié calms the tension between the three forces showing his face to the Chinese soldiers, who stand down and celebrate the news of their leader's return and rush to spread the news to other Chinese forces on the ship.\n\nHowever, upon hearing this news, Chang barrages the \"Valkyrie\" with his warship, hoping to \"bury the truth and everyone with it\". With no ordnance to strike back, Recker, Irish and Hannah volunteer to manually destroy it with explosives. Driving a boat to the warship's blind spot, the trio set the remote charges and use grappling guns to bring them to safety under the Suez Canal Bridge before detonating the explosives. Unfortunately, the remote detonation fails, requiring manual replacement of the charges. Hannah volunteers to set a new charge, but Irish stops her, volunteering to do it himself because China will need Hannah. Recker—and the player—is forced to take two options: either do nothing as Chang's warship obliterates the \"Valkyrie\", thus killing Pac, Garrison and Jin Jié; or send either Hannah or Irish back down to set the explosives. As soon as the detonator lights green, Recker detonates the charges, destroying Chang's ship but killing whoever had gone down to make it possible. A U.S. rescue helicopter then picks up Recker and his remaining teammate, reporting to Garrison that one member is missing in action. During the credits, the player hears a new dialogue between Irish and Hannah, discussing their pasts, and how they have to keep moving forward with \"no fucking regrets\".\n\nElectronic Arts president Frank Gibeau confirmed the company's intention to release a sequel to \"Battlefield 3\" during a keynote at the University of Southern California where he said \"There is going to be a \"Battlefield 4\"\". Afterwards, an EA spokesperson told IGN: \"Frank was speaking broadly about the \"Battlefield\" brand—a brand that EA is deeply passionate about and a fan community that EA is committed to.\" On the eve of \"Battlefield 3\"s launch, EA Digital Illusions CE told Eurogamer it was the Swedish studio's hope that it would one day get the opportunity to make \"Battlefield 4\". \"This feels like day one now,\" executive producer Patrick Bach said. \"It's exciting. The whole Frostbite 2 thing has opened up a big landscape ahead of us so we can do whatever we want.\"\n\n\"Battlefield 4\" is built on the new Frostbite 3 engine. The new \"Frostbite\" engine enables more realistic environments with higher resolution textures and particle effects. A new \"networked water\" system is also being introduced, allowing all players in the game to see the same wave at the same time. Tessellation has also been overhauled. An Alpha Trial commenced on June 17, 2013 with invitations randomly emailed to Battlefield 3 players the day prior. The trial ran for two weeks and featured the Siege of Shanghai map with all of its textures removed, essentially making it a \"whitebox\" test.\n\nDue to mixed reception of the two-player Co-op Mode in \"Battlefield 3\", DICE decided to omit the mode from \"Battlefield 4\" to focus on improving both the campaign and multiplayer components instead.\n\nAMD and DICE have partnered for AMD's Mantle API to be used on Battlefield 4. The goal was to boost performance on AMD GCN Radeon graphic cards providing a higher level of hardware-optimized performance than was previously possible with OpenGL or DirectX. Initial tests of AMD's Mantle showed it was an effective enhancement for slower processors.\n\nDICE released an Open Beta for the game that was available on Windows (64 bit only), Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. It featured the game-modes Domination, Conquest and Obliteration which were playable on the map Siege of Shanghai. The Open Beta started on October 4, 2013 and ended on October 15, 2013.\n\nUpon release, \"Battlefield 4\" was riddled with major technical bugs, glitches and crashes across all platforms. EA and DICE soon began releasing several patches for the game on all systems and DICE later revealed that work on all of its future games (including \"Mirror's Edge\", \"\" and \"Battlefield 4\" DLC) would be halted until \"Battlefield 4\" was working properly. In December 2013, more than a month after the game's initial release, an EA representative said, \"We know we still have a ways to go with fixing the game – it is absolutely our #1 priority. The team at DICE is working non-stop to update the game.\"\n\nEA President Peter Moore announced in January 2014 that the company did not see any negative impact to sales as a result of the myriad of technical issues. He said any negative impacts to sales were actually due to the transition from current-generation (PS3, Xbox 360) to next-generation consoles (PS4, Xbox One), and that other video game franchises like \"FIFA\" and \"Need for Speed\" were experiencing similar effects. As a reward for players who bought the game early and continued to play it despite all of the bugs and glitches, DICE rewarded players in February 2014 with all-month-long, free multi-player content such as: bronze and silver Battlepacks, XP boosts and events, camouflage skins, shortcut bundles for weapons and additional content for Premium members.\n\nBecause of the widespread bugs and glitches that were present, EA became the target of multiple law firms. The firm Holzer Holzer & Fistel, LLC launched an investigation into EA's public statements made between July 24 and December 4, 2013 to determine if the company intentionally misled its investors with information pertaining to, \"the development and sales of the Company's Battlefield 4 video game and the game's impact on EA's revenue and projects moving forward.\" Shortly thereafter, the law firm Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP similarly filed a class action lawsuit against EA for releasing false or misleading statements about the quality of \"Battlefield 4\". A second class action lawsuit was announced only days later from the firm Bower Piven, which alleged that EA violated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by not properly informing its investors about the major bugs and glitches during development that may have prevented the investors from making an informed decision about \"Battlefield 4\". Bower Piven sought out investors who lost more than US$200,000 to become the lead plaintiff. In October 2014, Judge Susan Illston dismissed one of the class action suits' original case on the grounds that EA did not intentionally mislead investors, instead its pre-release claims about \"Battlefield 4\" were a \"vague statement of corporate optimism,\" \"an inactionable opinion\" and \"puffery.\"\n\nSix months after the initial release of the game, in April 2014, DICE released a program called Community Test Environment (CTE), which let a limited number of PC gamers play a different version of \"Battlefield 4\" that was designed to test new patches and updates before giving them a wide-release. One of the major patches tested was an update to the game's netcode, specifically the \"tickrate,\" which is how frequently the game and server would update, measured in cycles per second. Because of the size of \"Battlefield 4\" in terms of information, DICE initially chose to have a low tickrate. However, the low tickrate resulted in a number of issues including damage registration and \"trade kills.\" The CTE program tested the game at a higher tickrate, among other common problems, and began rolling out patches in mid-2014.\n\nIn October 2014, nearly a full year after the official release with major updates still being put out, DICE LA producer David Sirland said the company acknowledged that the release of \"Battlefield 4\" \"absolutely\" damaged the trust of the franchise's fanbase. Sirland said that the shaky release of \"Battlefield 4\" caused the company to reevaluate their release model, and plan on being more transparent and offer earlier beta tests with future installments, namely (at the time) with \"Battlefield Hardline\" (2015). Sirland also said: \"We still probably have a lot of players who won't trust us to deliver a stable launch or a stable game. I don't want to say anything because I want to \"do\". I want them to look at what we're doing and what we are going to do and that would be my answer. I think we have to \"do\" things to get them to trust us, not say things to get them to trust us. Show by doing.\"\n\nIn March 2013, Electronic Arts opened the \"Battlefield 4\" website with three official teasers, entitled \"Prepare 4 Battle\". Each hints at three kinds of battlespace: air, land and sea. EA then continued to release teaser trailers leading up to the unveiling of \"Battlefield 4\" at the Game Developers Conference on March 26, 2013. The following day, \"Battlefield 4\"s first gameplay trailer, which doubled as a showcase for the Frostbite 3 engine was released. Shortly thereafter, EA listed the game for pre-order on Origin for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360; however, EA excluded any mention of the next generation consoles.\n\nIn July 2012, \"Battlefield 4\" was announced when EA advertised on their Origin client that those who pre-ordered \" (either Digital Deluxe or the limited edition)\" would receive early access to the \"Battlefield 4\" beta, this has since been expanded to include any \"Battlefield 3\" Premium owners, and any Origin users who pre-purchase \"Battlefield 4\" Digital Deluxe Edition. Although players who qualify for access in more than one way will only be granted one beta pass for their account and is non transferable to other players. The \"Exclusive\" beta started on October 1, 2013, with the open beta that went live on October 4. The beta will be on three platforms, PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 and features the Siege of Shanghai map on the Conquest game mode.\n\nDICE revealed more \"Battlefield 4\" content in the E3 2013 event at June 10, 2013, such as multiplayer modes, and allowed participants to play the game at the same event. More information was released at Gamescom 2013 in Cologne, Germany, such as the \"Paracel Storm\" multiplayer map and Battlefield 4 Premium. Battlefield 4 Premium includes five digital expansion packs featuring new maps and in-game content. Two-weeks early access to all expansion packs. Personalization options including camos, paints, emblems, dog tags and more. Priority position in server queues. Weekly updates with new content. Double XP events, 12 Battle Packs. Battle Packs are digital packages that contain a combination of new weapon accessories, dog tags, knives, XP boosts, and character customization items, three are included with all pre-orders of the Origin Digital Deluxe edition. The service will also transfer your Premium membership from Xbox 360 to Xbox One or PS3 to PS4. Premium membership pre-orders started the day the service was announced (August 21, 2013). DICE has also announced that if you purchase the game for a current generation system (PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360) you will be able to trade it in for a PlayStation 4 or Xbox One version of the game for as little as $10. Additionally all PlayStation 3 and 4 copies will include a code in the box to redeem a digital copy on the PlayStation Store.\n\nAn important strategy of DICE's market strategy to promote Battlefield 4 was the series of TV and web advertisements entitled \"Only in Battlefield 4\". Each one of these TV spots was narrated by a player of Battlefield 4 describing one of the unique experiences they encountered, along with a re-creation of the event using gameplay footage. These advertisements highlighted the free-form nature of the upcoming game, such as the destructibility of the environment and the dynamic nature of the game's combat engine. These events included things such as demonstrating the new \"Levolution\" feature, upgrades to gameplay, and unscripted moments that cannot occur in other games' multiplayer mode.\n\nDue to poor reception from gamers, on May 30, 2013, EA discontinued the online pass for all existing and future EA games including \"Battlefield 4\".\n\nA companion application was also released for iOS and Android.\n\n\"Battlefield 4\" featured a total of five downloadable content (DLC) packs that included new maps and additions to gameplay. All five DLC packs were available two weeks prior to their scheduled release by players who had purchased Premium. Once support for Battlefield 4 Premium ended, DICE announced all future DLC would be free.\n\nOn May 21, 2013, DICE unveiled \"Battlefield 4: China Rising\" on a Battlelog post and stated that it would include four new maps (Silk road, Altai Range, Dragon Pass and Guilin peaks) on the Chinese mainland, ten new assignments, new vehicles, as well as the Air Superiority gametype. It is available to those who pre-ordered the game at no extra cost. It was released to premium players on December 3, 2013 followed by a general release on December 17, 2013.\n\nOn June 10, 2013, DICE unveiled \"Battlefield 4: Second Assault\" during the Microsoft Press Conference at E3 2013. It was announced that it would be the first expansion pack to be released for \"Battlefield 4\" and would first debut on the Xbox One. It was released on November 22, 2013, the same day the Xbox One was launched. The expansion features the return of four fan-favorite maps from \"Battlefield 3\" and introduces Capture the Flag as a new gametype. On February 18, 2014, Second Assault became available as Premium exclusive for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and PC. It became available for non-Premium users on March 4, 2014.\n\nDuring January 29 – February 28, 2015, the expansion was free of charge to all EA Access subscribers.\n\nOn August 20, 2013, DICE unveiled \"Battlefield 4: Naval Strike\" at Gamescom 2013. It involves dynamic combat on four new maps taking place in the South China Sea and features a new mode called \"Carrier Assault\" inspired by \"Battlefield 2142\". The original release date was planned for March 25, 2014 for premium members and April 8, 2014 for non-premium members but was delayed several hours before release for Xbox One and PC without a new release date being set. On March 26, 2014, \"Naval Strike\" was released for premium members on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and Xbox 360. The Xbox One version was released for premium members on March 27, 2014, and the PC version was released on March 31, 2014.\n\nAt Gamescom 2013 DICE unveiled \"Battlefield 4: Dragon's Teeth\". Its maps take place in war-torn cities locked down by the People's Liberation Army. Dragon's Teeth was released on July 15, 2014 for Battlefield 4 Premium Members. For Non-Premium members it was released 2 weeks later on July 29, 2014. A new game mode included in this Dragon's Teeth DLC is called \"Chain Link\". There are four new maps included in Dragon's Teeth called \"Lumphini Garden, Pearl Market, Propaganda and Sunken Dragon\". There are 11 new Assignments and a new assault drone called the \"R.A.W.R\" that can be found on those four maps.\n\nOn August 20, 2013, DICE unveiled \"Battlefield 4: Final Stand\" at Gamescom 2013. \"Final Stand\" focuses on the conclusion of the in-game war of 2020. It includes four new maps and \"secret prototype weapons and vehicles\". The four maps that are included are \"Operation Whiteout\", \"Giants of Karelia\", \"Hammerhead\" and \"Hangar 21\". New weapons include the Rorsch X1 Handheld Railgun and some gadgets including the DS-3 and XD-1 Accipiter MKV, as well as a hovercraft tank based on the Levkov 1937 Hovercraft MBT. It was released for \"Battlefield 4\" Premium members on November 18, 2014, 00:01 and for non-Premium \"Battlefield 4\" players on December 2, 2014, 00:01.\n\nThe \"Weapons Crate\" DLC was announced by DICE on March 30, 2015 as a free DLC. The DLC added five weapons into the game: the Mare's Leg, AN-94, Groza-1, Groza-4 and the L86A2 along with the gamemode from Battlefield 3 'Gun Master' and many other stat changes. It was released in an alpha form in the Community Test Environment. It was released along with the Spring 2015 Patch on May 26, 2015.\n\nIn August 2015, DICE announced the expansion pack \"Night Operations\", a free DLC pack. The first map to be released was Zavod: Graveyard shift, a night time version of the \"Battlefield 4\" map Zavod 311, it was released with the Summer 2015 Patch. Two other night maps were also in development, a night time version of the map Siege of Shanghai and Golmud Railway, these maps were playable in the Battlefield 4 Community Test Environment but would remain unreleased as further development on Battlefield 4 ended. All three maps were developed by DICE LA and tested in the Community Test Environment with player feedback taken on board.\n\n\"Community Operations\" was released on October 27, 2015, a free DLC pack. The map, Outbreak, is a medium-sized with lots of vegetation such as trees, shrubs, and grass for ambushing the enemies within. There are limited amounts of heavy vehicles such as tanks, LAVs and no anti-air vehicles. The map does not include air dominance such as stealth jets, scout helicopters and attack aircraft. This map was created by DICE Los Angeles and the \"Battlefield 4\" gaming community. The update contains major changes to weapons and vehicles.\n\n\"Legacy Operations\" was released on December 15, 2015, a free DLC pack. The map is an updated version of the \"Battlefield 2\" map, Dragon Valley. It was released alongside the Winter Patch content update.\n\nPremium is a downloadable pass that offers all of the downloadable content for a discounted price. Premium offers a range of personalization options and items, such as exclusive dog tags or camos. Premium contributes to the game by offering select days in which special events take place only for premium members.\n\n\"Battlefield 4\" received positive reviews from critics. Chris Watters of \"GameSpot\" gave praise to Obliteration Mode and the multiplayer elements but was otherwise unimpressed with the campaign. IGN's Mitch Dyer stated that \"\"Battlefield 4\" is a greatest hits album of DICE's multiplayer legacy\" for same versions. Evan Lahti of \"PC Gamer\" stated that although the game strongly resembles \"Battlefield 3\" it still manages to remain \"a visually and sonically satisfying, reliably intense FPS\". Commander Mode and the diverse map selection within multiplayer were also praised as being good additions to the game. \"Joystiq\"'s David Hinkle said that the game \"drops players into a sandbox and unhooks all tethers, loosing scores of soldiers to squad up and take down the opposition however they choose\". Hinkle praised the campaign elements, but found the multiplayer to not hold any surprises. \"GameZone\" Lance Liebl stated \"Your success in Battlefield is up to you and how well you work as a team. And it's one of the most rewarding games I've played. Battlelog needs some refinement, and there's still way too many crashes, but the multiplayer more than makes up for all of it.\" Machinima's Lawrence Sonntag praised the Levolution feature and the multiplayer mode.\n\nHowever several reviewers noted that the multiplayer part of the game had been released with a lot of game breaking bugs on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One (client or server crashes, lag). \"Polygon\" reviewed the game the day of its release, and gave it 7.5, then later downgraded their score to 4 after acknowledging that the game \"was still barely playable for many players\".\n\nDICE later acknowledged the issues with the multiplayer part of the game and said they were working to fix them, and that they would not work on expansions or future projects until the game problems were resolved. Despite this promise, the game's second expansion was released while numerous recurring problems had yet to be resolved.\n\nIn late December 2013, shortly after the release of the \"China Rising\" DLC pack, China banned the sale of \"Battlefield 4\", requesting stores and online vendors to remove the game and encouraging those who have already purchased the game to remove it from their consoles and/or PCs. The game was viewed as a national security risk in the form of a cultural invasion as the DLC includes four maps on the Chinese mainland.\n\nAn editorial from the \"China National Defense Newspaper\" (a subsidiary of the PLA Daily) published in December 2013 criticized the game for discrediting China's national sovereignty, and stated that while in the past the Soviet Union would often be used as an imaginary enemy in video games, the shift has recently turned to China.\n\nDuring the first week of sales in the United Kingdom, \"Battlefield 4\" became the second best-selling game on all available formats, only behind \"\". The game's sales were down 69% compared to 2011's \"Battlefield 3\". EA blamed the fall in demand on uncertainty caused by the upcoming transition to eighth generation consoles.\n\nAccording to NPD Group figures, \"Battlefield 4\" was the second best-selling game of November in the United States, only behind \"\". In February 2014, EA announced that the Premium service for the game had sold more than 1.6 million copies. In May 2014, the game had sold more than 7 million copies.\n\nAccording to EA, \"Battlefield 4\" received awards from over 30 gaming publications prior to its release. \"Battlefield 4\" appeared on several year-end lists of the best First-person shooter games of 2013, receiving wins from 18th Satellite Awards, and GamesRadar.\n\n"}

The convention compliments the previously established provisions of UNESCO including the Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity of 2001. \"The Convention recognises the rights of Parties to take measures to protect and promote the diversity of cultural expressions, and impose obligations at both domestic and international levels on Parties.\" The Convention is available in six authoritative texts including Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish.\n\nAs of December 2016, the Convention has 146 parties, which includes 145 states and the European Union.\n\nThe Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions is a precursor for seven UNESCO conventions which deal with the four core areas of creative diversity; cultural and natural heritage, movable cultural property, intangible cultural heritage and contemporary creativity. These seven UNESCO conventions include the Universal Copyright Convention (1952, followed by a revision in 1971), the Convention for the Protection and Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (1954/1999), the Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property (1970), the Convention Concerning the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage (1972), the Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage (2001), the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage (2003),and the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions (2005).\n\nThe Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions deals with specific articles in the UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity, Articles 8 through 11. These articles clarify three issues. First, the relationship that identity has with cultural goods and services, which values and meaning should not be treated as economic goods. Second, the States have the responsibility for the protection and promotion for the \"diversity of cultural expressions and ensuring the free flow of ideas and works\". Third, there needs to be international co-operation.\n\nThe Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions is a legally binding international agreement that ensures artists, cultural professionals, practitioners and citizens worldwide can create, produce, disseminate and enjoy a broad range of cultural goods, services and activities, including their own. Cultural expressions are conveyed by activities, goods and services, which results in an economic and cultural nature. Due to this dual sided nature, cultural expressions cannot be seen purely as objects of trade.\n\nThe Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions main objective is to strengthen creation, production, distribution/dissemination, access and enjoyment of cultural expressions transmitted by cultural activities, goods and services, with a strong focus on developing countries. The promotion of dialogue and creativity of cultural diversity is an necessary element in the goal to achieve peace and sustainable development. The Convention was adopted in response to \"growing pressure exerted on countries to waive their right to enforce cultural policies and to put all aspects of the cultural sector on the table when negotiating international trade agreements.\" \"The international community signalled the urgency to implement an international law that would recognize the distinctive nature of cultural goods, services and activities as vehicles of identity, values and meaning and that while cultural goods, services and activities have important economic value, they are not mere commodities or consumer goods that can only be regarded as objects of trade.\"\n\nThe Convention's main objective is to provide a legally binding international agreement that reaffirms the sovereign right of States to adopt cultural policies that support their cultural industries. The Convention does not want to control and restrict cultural expressions, but to promote and protect them. Recognizing that the diversity of cultural expressions is a \"rich asset for individuals and societies, the protection, promotion and maintenance of cultural diversity are an essential requirement for sustainable development for the benefit of present and future generations.\". The Convention also defines on cultural industry and interculturality\n\nSince the late 1980s, a growing number of countries were showing concern that \"the proliferation of trade agreements promoting absolute market liberalization dramatically increased the threat to cultural industries. Countries wishing to retain their right to enforce cultural policies risked being marginalized and unable to maintain their position.\"\n\n\nThe preliminary draft was drawn up over a series of two years, 2003–2005. The Director-General of UNESCO assigned fifteen experts to write a draft called the Convention on the Protection of the Diversity of Cultural Contents and Artistic Expressions. Meetings were held for suggested improvements and the draft eventually led to the adoption of the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions on 20 October 2005.\n\n\nAs of February 2018, 145 states and the European Union have ratified or acceded to the Convention.\n\nThe Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions contains the following:\n\nAll cultural actors are required to participate as custodians to the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions. These include States and institutions recognised by the Convention, civil actors and civil society, private actors, such as cultural enterprises and industries, especially in developing nations and minorities and indigenous peoples.\n\nThe beneficiaries to the Convention are unlimited. The Convention benefits all peoples because the ability to participate and promote cultural diversity is profitable for all individuals and societies. Also, recognition for the creators of cultural expressions and the communities that celebrate their works. A major beneficiary to the Convention are the artists and practitioners of the cultural expressions.\nIn addition to the broad ranged beneficiaries, the Convention lists several specific groups such as women, indigenous peoples, minorities, and artists and practitioners of developing nations. Countries with the inability to produce and disseminate their own cultural expressions, such as developing nations. The Convention provides such need based nations financial assistance for the artists and practitioners of cultural expressions.\n\nTo become parties to the convention, member states of UNESCO must follow the traditional procedure; deposit and instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession with the Director-General of UNESCO. Invited non-member states, and regional economic integration organisations may also accede to the convention. The convention entered into force on 18 March 2007 after it had been ratified by 30 states. As of March 2016, the convention has been ratified by 140 states and by the European Union.\n\nThe main objective for the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions is to protect and promote the diversity of cultural expressions. The Convention highlights the fact that cultural creativity has been placed upon all of humanity and that aside from economical gains, creative diversity reaps plenty of cultural and social advantages. States must also promote \"openness to other cultures of the world\". Protective measures are also included in the Convention and international co-operation is encouraged in times of need. This Convention works to strengthen economic growth and cultural acceptance.\n\nAdditional objectives are as follows:\n\n\nThe Convention also affirms that \"Cultural diversity can be protected and promoted only if human rights and fundamental freedoms, such as freedom of expression, information and communication, as well as the ability of individuals to choose cultural expresions, are guaranteed.\" in a manner against a cultural relativism that may undermine universality of human rights.\n\nOperational Guidelines for the Convention: A series of operational guidelines were approved by the Conference of Parties at its second (15–16 June 2009) and third session (14–15 June 2011) in Paris, France.\n\nRules of Procedure of the Conference of Parties to the 2005 Convention: Adopted by the Conference of Parties to the Convention at its first(18–20 June 2007) and second sessions (15–16 June 2009) in Paris, France.\n\nRules of Procedure of the Intergovernmental Committees for the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions: Adopted but the Intergovernmental Committees for the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions at its first session in Ottawa, Canada (10–13 December 2007) and approved by the Conference of Parties to the 2005 Convention at its second session in Paris, France (15–16 June 2009).\n\nFinancial Regulations for the Special Account for the International Fund for Cultural Diversity.\n\n\n"}

The official purpose of the test is to assess both individual and group knowledge and skills. EOCTs are mandatory and require a minimum score for graduation eligibility. Additionally, a North Carolina student's EOCT score must account for at least 25% of the student's final grade in the relevant course. \n\nGeorgia high schools are required to administer a standardized, multiple-choice EOCT, in each of eight core subjects including Algebra I, Geometry, U.S. History, Economics, Biology, Physical Science, Ninth Grade Literature and Composition, and American Literature and Composition. The official purpose of the tests is to assess \"specific content knowledge and skills.\" Although a minimum test score is not required for the student to receive credit in the course or to graduate from high school, completion of the test is mandatory. The EOCT score comprises 20% of a student's grade in the course. Since the EOCT is an official, state-administered test, any violation or interference can result in the invalidation of scores of all students taking the exam on that subject. Interferences can include cellphones, mp3 players, reading books on the same subject as the exam, and talking.\n\nAlso, E.O.C tests can be taken in middle schools.For example in the state of Florida it is mandatory for 7th graders (Middle school) to take a Civics EOC Test.

It refers to the study of dogs within their cultural contexts. The term is not in general use. \n\nCummins states that the domestic dog, despite being found in virtually all human societies, has been ignored by anthropologists. This, he says, is because the dog is neither fully of \"culture\" (being essentially a domesticated wolf), nor of \"nature\", by virtue of that same domestication and having been molded into over 400 breeds. Nonetheless, Cummins leans towards the view that, being domestic animals, they are more \"of culture\" than \"of nature\", and culture is the domain of the anthropologist. Furthermore, different human societies have shaped the dog into precisely whatever roles people might have for the dog. Therefore, the domestic dog is worthy of anthropological attention; hence ethnocynology.\n\n"}

It stars Scarlett Johansson, Takeshi Kitano, Michael Pitt, Pilou Asbæk, Chin Han and Juliette Binoche. Set in a near future when the line between humans and robots is blurring, the plot follows the Major (Johansson), a cyborg supersoldier who investigates her past.\n\nFilming for \"Ghost in the Shell\" took place in New Zealand from February to June 2016, with additional filming in Hong Kong that June. The film premiered in Tokyo on March 16, 2017, and was released in the United States on March 31, 2017, in 2D, 3D, IMAX 3D and 4DX. It received mixed reviews, with praise for its visual style, action sequences, cinematography and score, but criticism for its story and lack of character development. The casting of Caucasian actors, particularly Johansson, drew accusations of racism and whitewashing in the United States. It grossed $169 million worldwide against a production budget of $110 million, and is considered a box office bomb.\n\nIn the near future, humans are augmented with cybernetic improvements to traits such as vision, strength, and intelligence. Augmentation developer Hanka Robotics establishes a secret project to develop an artificial body, or \"shell\", that can integrate a human brain rather than an AI. Mira Killian, the sole survivor of a cyberterrorist attack which killed her parents, is chosen as the test subject after her body is damaged beyond repair. Over the objections of her designer Dr. Ouelet, Hanka's CEO, Cutter, decides to use Killian as a counter-terrorism operative.\n\nA year later, Killian has attained the rank of Major in the anti-terrorist bureau Section 9, working alongside operatives Batou and Togusa under Chief Daisuke Aramaki. Killian, who experiences hallucinations that Ouelet dismisses as glitches, is troubled by how little she remembers of her past. The team thwarts a terrorist attack on a Hanka business conference, and Killian destroys a robotic geisha after it murders a hostage. After learning that the geisha was hacked by an unknown entity known as Kuze, Killian breaks protocol and \"dives\" into its AI for answers. The entity attempts a counter-hack, and Batou is forced to disconnect her. They trace the hacker to a yakuza nightclub, where they are lured into a trap. The explosion destroys Batou's eyes and damages Killian's body. Cutter is enraged by Killian's actions, and threatens to have Section 9 shut down unless Aramaki keeps her in line.\n\nKuze tracks down Section 9's Hanka consultant, Dr. Dahlin, and kills her. The team links her murder to the deaths of other senior company researchers and realize that Ouelet is the next target. Kuze takes control of two sanitation workers and sends them to kill Ouelet. Batou, now with cybernetic eyes, kills one while the repaired Killian subdues the other. While they interrogate the worker, Kuze speaks through him before compelling him to commit suicide. Togusa traces the hack to a secret location, where the team discovers a large number of humans mentally linked as a makeshift signal network. Killian is captured and Kuze reveals that he is a failed Hanka test subject from the same project that created Killian. He urges her to question her own memories, then frees her and escapes.\n\nKillian confronts Ouelet, who admits that 98 test subjects died before Killian, and that her memories are implanted. Cutter has decided that Killian is a liability and orders Ouelet to kill her after she returns to Hanka Robotics. Instead, Ouelet gives Killian an address and helps her escape. Cutter kills Ouelet, but blames Killian, saying that she has gone rogue. He informs Aramaki and the team that Killian must be terminated.\n\nKillian follows the address to an apartment occupied by a widowed mother, who reveals that her daughter, Motoko Kusanagi, ran away from home a year ago and was arrested. Motoko took her own life while in custody. Killian leaves and contacts Aramaki, who allows Cutter to remotely eavesdrop on their conversation. Batou, Togusa, and Aramaki eliminate Cutter's men trying to ambush them, while Killian follows her memories to the hideaway where Motoko was last seen. There, she and Kuze meet and recall their past lives as anti-augmentation radicals who were abducted by Hanka as test subjects.\n\nCutter deploys a \"spider-tank\" to kill them. Kuze nearly dies before Killian is able to tear off the tank's motor, losing an arm in the process. Mortally wounded, Kuze offers to merge his \"ghost\" with Killian's, but Killian refuses. Kuze fades out, then a Hanka sniper kills him. Batou and the team rescue Killian, while Aramaki executes Cutter with Killian's consent. The next day, Killian, now repaired and embracing her true identity as the Japanese Motoko, reconnects with her mother and returns to work with Section 9.\n\nIn the Japanese dub, Atsuko Tanaka, Akio Ōtsuka and Kōichi Yamadera reprise the roles they played in the Mamoru Oshii films and the \"\" television series.\n\nIn 2008, DreamWorks (who had handled U.S. theatrical distribution of \"\" through its Go Fish Pictures banner) and Steven Spielberg acquired the rights to produce a live-action film adaptation of the original manga. Avi Arad and Steven Paul were later confirmed as producers, with Jamie Moss set to write the screenplay. In October 2009, it was announced that Laeta Kalogridis had replaced Moss as writer. On January 24, 2014, it was reported that Rupert Sanders would direct the film, with the screenplay now written by William Wheeler. Wheeler worked on the script for approximately a year and a half, later saying, \"It's a vast enterprise. I think I was second or third in the mix, and I know there have been at least six or seven writers.\" Jonathan Herman also worked on the screenplay. Ultimately, credit for the screenplay was given to Moss, William Wheeler and Ehren Kruger.\n\nOn September 3, 2014, Margot Robbie was reported as being in early talks for the lead role. On October 16, it was announced that DreamWorks had made a $10 million offer to Scarlett Johansson for the lead role, after Robbie had chosen to play Harley Quinn in \"Suicide Squad\" instead. In May 2015, Paramount Pictures agreed to co-produce and co-finance the film. On November 10, 2015, Pilou Asbæk was cast in the role of Batou. According to \"TheWrap\", Matthias Schoenaerts was previously circling the role that went to Asbæk. On November 19, 2015, it was reported that Sam Riley was in early talks to play the villain role Kuze, leader of dangerous criminals and extremists, though on February 4, 2016, \"Variety\" reported that Michael Pitt had entered talks for the role. On March 3, 2016, \"TheWrap\" reported that Japanese actor Takeshi Kitano had been cast as Daisuke Aramaki, the founder and leader of the elite unit Section 9, tasked with protecting the world from the most dangerous technological threats.\n\nPrincipal photography on the film began on location in Wellington, New Zealand, on February 1, 2016. In April 2016, the full cast was announced, including Juliette Binoche, Chin Han, Lasarus Ratuere and Kaori Momoi. In May 2016, Rila Fukushima was cast in a role. Filming wrapped in New Zealand on June 3, 2016. Filming also took place in the Yau Ma Tei and Jordan areas of Hong Kong, around Pak Hoi Street and Woosung Street on June 7, 8 and 10 or 14–16.\n\n\"Ghost in the Shell\" was originally scheduled for release on April 14, 2017, by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures through their Touchstone Pictures banner. The film was part of DreamWorks' distribution deal with Walt Disney Studios, which began in 2009. In April 2015, Disney moved the film's North American release date to March 31, 2017, with Paramount Pictures handling international distribution. However, it was reported in September 2015 that DreamWorks and Disney would not renew their distribution deal, which was set to expire in August 2016. In January 2016, Disney dropped the film from its slate after DreamWorks finalized their distribution deal with Universal Pictures in December 2015. Disney's distribution rights for the film were transferred completely to Paramount instead of Universal, with Paramount retaining Disney's release date of March 31, 2017. The film was not screened for critics before its release.\n\n\"Ghost in the Shell\" grossed $40.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $129.2 million in other territories, for a worldwide gross of $169.8 million, against a production budget of $110 million.\n\nIn North America, \"Ghost in the Shell\" opened alongside \"The Boss Baby\" and \"The Zookeeper's Wife\", and was projected to gross around $25 million from 3,440 theaters in its opening weekend. It made $1.8 million from Thursday night previews and $7.7 million on Friday, which includes the preview number. The film opened to $19 million, finishing third at the box office, behind \"The Boss Baby\" and \"Beauty and the Beast\". \"Deadline Hollywood\" attributed the poor opening to below-average critical reviews, an unclear marketing campaign, and no social media presence by Johansson. In its second weekend, the film grossed $7.4 million, dropping 60.4% and finishing 5th at the box office.\n\nKyle Davies, domestic distribution chief for Paramount, felt the controversy around the casting had damaged reviews, and said: \"...you're always trying to thread that needle between honoring the source material and mak[ing] a movie for a mass audience. That's challenging, but clearly the reviews didn't help.\" Conversely, Deadline argued that the negative critical assessment was due to the film being \"cold, boring, thoughtless, and the same old next to its futuristic ancestors \"The Matrix\" and \"Blade Runner\",\" and suggested that Paramount held the film from review because they \"knew they had a lame duck.\" Deadline also reported that the film is expected to lose at least $60 million against its total advertising and production costs of $250 million.\n\nJapanese box office reception since the official release in the country, on April 7, was more positive, earning $3.3 million during its first three days in theaters. In Japan, \"Ghost in the Shell\" made it to second place, just behind \"Sing\".\n\nIn China, the film debuted at number one, grossing in $22.1 million and claiming the spot from \"\", which had held it for three weeks. Nevertheless, it performed below already muted expectations, leading to the Chinese media calling it a flop.\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, \"Ghost in the Shell\" has an approval rating of 43%, based on 258 reviews, with an average rating of 5.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"Ghost in the Shell\" boasts cool visuals and a compelling central performance from Scarlett Johansson, but the end result lacks the magic of the movie's classic source material.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 52 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews.\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nJustin Chang of the \"Los Angeles Times\" praised the film's visuals and production, saying: \"Some of that ravishment arrives courtesy of the movie's setting, a stunning pan-Asian metropolis that makes boldly inventive use of the Hong Kong skyline, its tightly stacked buildings tricked out with enormous holographic billboards. (The cinematography and production design, both staggering, are by Jess Hall and Jan Roelfs, respectively.)\" Michael Phillips of \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film 3/4 and said, \"This isn't jokey, quippy science fiction; true to the source material, it's fairly grave about the implications of an android-dominated culture, though of course \"Ghost in the Shell\" is also about giant mecha spiders equipped with machine guns.\"\n\nRichard Roeper of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film 2.5 out of 4 stars, saying: \"Just about every scene in \"Ghost in the Shell\" is a visual wonder to behold—and you'll have ample to time to soak in all that background eye candy, because the plot machinations and the action in the foreground are largely of the ho-hum retread variety.\" Evan Narcisse of \"io9\" commented that the film failed to capture the feel of the source material, with the biggest problem being the Major asking the wrong sort of existential questions about herself.\n\nCecilia D'Anastasio of \"Kotaku\" commented on the film's failure to adhere to the source material, saying: \"Somebody misjudged how poorly American superhero movie tropes would map onto \"Ghost in the Shell\",\" and that \"[the] final scene tried to do that 'satisfying our need for closure' thing American directors think is kind, but is actually condescending.\" Brian Truitt of \"USA Today\" gave the film 1.5/4, stating: \"\"Ghost in the Shell\" is a defective mess with lifeless characters, missed chances for thematic exploration and a minefield of political incorrectness.\"\n\nManohla Dargis of \"The New York Times\" expressed disappointment at the absence of the original's \"big, human, all-too-human questions\" in contrast to the retention of action clichés, such as chases and gun fights. Dargis also criticized the absence of the unique setting, stating that \"The original manga takes place in what’s described as a \"strange corporate conglomerate-state called ‘Japan,’\" while this movie unwinds nowhere in particular, just a universal megalopolis filled with soaring gray towers.\"\n\nNicholas Barber of the BBC described the film as \"conceptually and visually breathtaking,\" an elaborately designed and detailed dystopia which seems disturbingly real.\n\nPeter Suderman of \"Vox\" and Emily Yoshida of \"Vulture\" criticized the removal of philosophical ideas from the story, feeling the movie westernized the story and changed the search for the idea of a soul to finding individuality and memories. Others called it an action movie that for once does not throw philosophy overboard.\n\nJames Hadfield of the \"Japan Times\" argued that the film missed the mark, but was better than Hollywood's previous attempts at adapting anime for the big screen.\n\nThe film has a 3.48 star (out of 5) rating on Yahoo Movies Japan, with four stars for its visuals and three for its story. On April 10, 2017, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" noted that the adaptation's rating on Yahoo Movies Japan was higher than the 3.2 rating of the 1995 original anime film.\n\n\"Ghost in the Shell\" was released on digital on July 7, 2017, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray and DVD on July 25, 2017.\n\nThe casting of Scarlett Johansson as Major Mira Killian / Motoko Kusanagi brought accusations of whitewashing. Pavan Shamdasani of \"Asia Times\" wrote: \"The original is about as Asian as things get: Japanese cult manga, ground-breaking anime, Hong Kong-inspired locations, Eastern philosophy-based story. Most of that's been downright ignored with its big-screen adaptation, and Scarlett Johansson's casting as the dark-haired, obviously originally Asian lead sent netizens into a rage.\" In April 2016, \"ScreenCrush\" reported that the filmmakers had commissioned the use of CGI and other visual effects testing to alter Johansson's appearance to make her appear Asian, spurring further backlash. Paramount stated the tests were short-lived and did not involve Johansson. Some fans and industry employees argued that the controversy was a symptom of Hollywood's fear that casting non-white actors would bring less profit. Marc Bernardin of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote that \"the only race Hollywood cares about is the box office race\".\n\nIn Japan, fans were surprised that the casting had caused controversy, as they had already assumed that a Hollywood production would choose a white actress. They felt the appearance of the protagonist was immaterial due to the franchise's themes of self-identity and the blurring of artificial and natural bodies. \"The Hollywood Reporter\" spoke to a group of female Japanese American actors, including Keiko Agena, about the film; the actresses argued that Japanese natives are not upset by the film because of white beauty standards held in Japan. According to Justin Charity of \"Ringer\", \"your average Japanese citizen's outlook on diversity is much less influenced by pluralism than the outlooks of many Asian Americans, who live in a country where popular culture rarely represents them well, if at all. Hence, many Japanese Americans may find Johansson's casting in a \"Ghost in the Shell\" movie distressing, while native Japanese observers make nothing of it.\"\n\nParamount released a featurette of Mamoru Oshii, director of the anime films, visiting the studio, in which he says that Johansson exceeded his expectations for the role. Oshii told IGN that as the Major uses an assumed body and name, there was no basis for saying an Asian woman must portray her, and stated: \"I can only sense a political motive from the people opposing it, and I believe artistic expression must be free from politics.\" During a launch event in Tokyo, director Rupert Sanders said of Johansson: \"There are very few actresses with 20 years' experience who have the cyberpunk ethic already baked in. I stand by my decision—she's the best actress of her generation.\" Addressing the controversy, producer Steven Paul referred to the film's setting as \"an international world\" with characters of numerous nationalities.\n\nSam Yoshiba, director of the international business division at Kodansha's Tokyo headquarters, which holds the rights to the \"Ghost in the Shell\" series, said: \"Looking at her career so far, I think Scarlett Johansson is well cast. She has the cyberpunk feel. And we never imagined it would be a Japanese actress in the first place... this is a chance for a Japanese property to be seen around the world.\" Johansson said of the criticism: \"I certainly would never presume to play another race of a person. Diversity is important in Hollywood, and I would never want to feel like I was playing a character that was offensive. Also, having a franchise with a female protagonist driving it is such a rare opportunity. Certainly, I feel the enormous pressure of that—the weight of such a big property on my shoulders.\"\n\nThe film attracted further criticism for its ending, which reveals that Johansson's character was originally a Japanese girl. The Media Action Network for Asian Americans accused Johansson of lying when she said she would never play the role of a person of a different race than her own. Japanese-American actress Ai Yoshihara, speaking to \"The Hollywood Reporter\", said she felt the twist was \"white people trying to justify the casting\". Another Japanese-American actress, Atsuko Okatsuka, said: \"Hanka Robotics [the corporation in the film] is making a being that's the best of human and the best of robotics. For some reason, the best stuff they make happens to be white.\"\n\nThe film has been nominated in two categories for the Hollywood Post Alliance (HPA) Awards, and was also nominated for the 'Most Innovative Advertising' category at the Motion Picture Sound Editors' Golden Reel Awards. It won the 12th annual HPA Award for 'Color Grading'. The film was on the Academy Awards shortlist for the category of Visual Effects, and later ended up on the shortlist for Hair and Makeup, but was not nominated for either category. It was also nominated for Best Contemporary Make-up by the Make-Up and Hair Guild. On October 23, 2018, the film's composer Lorne Balfe received the \"Top Film Score\" award at the ASCAP London Music Awards.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46845117", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46845117", "title": "Haitian Vodou art", "text": "Haitian Vodou art\n\nHaitian Vodou art is art related to the Haitian Vodou religion. This religion has its roots in West African traditional religions brought to Haiti by slaves, but has assimilated elements from Europe and the Americas and continues to evolve. The most distinctive Vodou art form is the \"drapo Vodou\", an embroidered flag often decorated with sequins or beads, but the term covers a wide range of visual art forms including paintings, embroidered clothing, clay or wooden figures, musical instruments and assemblages. Since the 1950s there has been growing demand for Vodou art by tourists and collectors.\n\nArt historians disagree on the origins of Haitian Vodou arts. Suzanne Blier makes the case that they come from the coastal areas of Benin and Togo. Robert Farris Thompson makes a plausible connection with Central Africa based on similarities with \"nkisi\" figures from the Kongo, and cosmograms, flags, drums and dances from that region.\n\nThe first slaves from West and Central Africa were brought to the Caribbean in the 16th century. Europeans often claimed that the slaves were being rescued from devil worship. \nHowever, the slaves maintained their religious practices in secret, and their priests were among the leaders of the first revolt in Haiti in 1791.\nHaiti became the first independent nation of African people in the Western Hemisphere in 1804 under President Jean-Jacques Dessalines.\nThe traditional religion continued to be banned, and as late as the 1940s the Catholic church undertook a campaign against Vodou, ransacked temples and burned religious artifacts. \nMany of the techniques of sacred art have now been forgotten, and few sculptures were being made by 2001.\nThe Vodou religion was finally recognized officially in 2002.\n\nThe great majority of Haitians still practice the Vodou religion. \nThe religion continues to evolve, and in addition to the traditional West African \"lwo\" (spirits) it now includes the spirits of heroes of resistance to the colonial forces, and spirits of powerful religious leaders.\nThe iconography of the Haitian Vodou religion combines elements from Africa, Europe and the Americas.\nThus a \"drapo\" made for an African spirit may include an image of a Catholic saint. \nThe saint's image was originally in part designed to deceive Catholic missionaries, but also was chosen in recognition of similarity between the saint and the \"lwa\".\nSince then the saint and the spirit have become syncretized.\n\nVodou art can be difficult to classify in Western terms. \nRachel Beauvoir-Dominique, writing of Marianne Lehmann's Vodou art collection, notes that \"even today, the Creole language does not possess any word to designate what Western civilization qualifies as 'art'.\"\nPoet and critic André Breton dismissed Haitian art, noting that Haiti had no museums or art collections. \nHe apparently saw no value in the art associated with the \"backward\" Vodou religion.\n\nSome scholars distinguish narrative Haitian art, which may include depictions of events or ceremonies in which there are many images from Vodou, from \"Vodou art\" in the sense of art that has a sacred function. The latter would be designed for use in ceremonies or for placement in temples or on altars. \nGiven the omnipresence of Vodou in Haiti, most narrative art would also include Vodou images.\nHowever, the fluid and adaptive nature of Vodou makes it hard to clearly distinguish religion, art and religious art.\n\nAlessandra Benedicty points out that Western scholars are led by their postmodern intellectual framework into trying to explain Vodou art in terms of \"intellectual truths\". \nVodou is open-ended and sometimes purposely dissimulates. \nBenedicty writes that in \"the Vodou/Haitian aesthetic system, the \"objet d'art\" nurtures ambivalence and demands that the reader or the spectator interpret and thus participate in the production of an artistic text's meaning.\" If there is a \"veve\" in the work, there is a possibility that the \"lwa\" the work was made for will possess the viewer.\nThe purchaser of a Vodou altar or other artwork may be possessed by their purchase.\nA 1995 exhibit at the Fowler Museum of Cultural History in California of \"The Sacred Arts of Haitian Vodou\" included dramatic ritual interactions between Vodouists and \"lwa\" that may have included possession.\n\nA \"drapo Vodou\" is a handmade flag, typically embroidered and decorated with beads and sequins.\nAlthough flags may have been made in West Africa before the arrival of Europeans, the flags widely used there by 1600 were derived from European flags. \nThey were used as symbols of ethnic, military or religious allegiance.\nThe \"drapo Vodou\" also drew on Yoruba beadwork, Catholic vestments and Masonic aprons.\nIn the 19th century and early 20th century most \"drapo Vodou\" were made from one or two colored fabric pieces decorated with embroidery, metal bangles and glass beads, with an image of the \"lwa\" made of shiny fabrics appliquéd to the cloth using techniques still followed in West Africa.\nFlags and banners used in the 21st century in rural areas often still have stylistically simple designs, in part due to the high cost of decorative material.\n\nWith the older flags the background field that frames the image was usually decorated with widely spaced sequins or beads. \nModern flag makers often completely cover the fabric of the field with sparkling sequins of one color, or with intricate geometrical patterns. \nBorders, which were either simple or did not exist on early \"drapo Vodou\", have evolved into highly elaborate patterns.\nThe use of sequins in modern \"drapos\" dates to 1940, when Joseph Fortine saw a troupe of Afro-Brazilian samba dancers wearing sequin costumes in a Carnival parade. Fortine began to decorate the costumes of Rara band players with sequins, and in 1943 made a \"drapo Vodou\" for Damballa from a burlap coffee sack which he stretched on a wooden frame.\nHe made the image from sequin lines on a satin background, and added random sequins surrounding the image. \nFortine taught his techniques to sequin artists such as Edgard Jean Louis, Sylva Joseph, Clotaire Bazile, and Yves Telemak. \nThe youngest of these, Telemak, was the first to sign his work.\n\nThere are two kinds of \"drapo Vodou\". The \"drapo servis\" are made for ceremonial use, and art flags are made for sale.\n\nThe \"drapo servis\" are important religious icons. \nThey are kept in shrine rooms, and carried by flag bearers in elaborate ceremonies in the main chamber of the temple. A \"drapo servis\" will include an image of a Catholic saint or a \"vèvè\" (trace-work emblem) of an \"lwa\" (spirit) such as Papa Legba or Ogun of the Yoruba religion.\nThere are many \"lwas\", including Erzulie, Guédé, Damballa and La Sirene. \nThe purpose of a ceremonial \"drapo\" is to flatter the \"lwa\" in the hope of gaining favor in return. \nUsually \"drapo servis\" are made in pairs, for example representing Ogun and Damballa.\nOgun was the \"lwa\" who led the slaves to freedom, and Damballa is the snake, representing the life force.\nOgun may be paired with other \"lwas\".\n\nA \"drapo servis\" will have a central image surrounded by a diamond-shaped border, will often have a fringe, and will be in size. The image may depict a Catholic saint associated with an \"lwa\" or may be a \"veve\" that represents the \"lwa\" symbolically and provides a gateway for it to enter the world of humans.\nThe image may be a chromolithograph, a vividly colored paper image from Italy, Mexico or Spain of a Catholic saint that has been syncretized with the corresponding African spirit of the drapo. The image may be an outline of the saint traced from a chromolithograph, or may be a detailed and faithful copy of a chromolithograph in beads and sequins.\n\nThe most widely used images of saints are those of Saint Isidore, Saint James Major, Saint Patrick and the Holy Virgin.\nVeves include the ship of Agwé, the cemetery cross of Baron Samedi, the crossroads of Legba and so on.\nAn image of a mermaid is used on flags for the water spirit LaSiren. \nThis does not derive from \"veve\" or Catholic origins, but seems to have come from European nautical sources.\nThe image of a fish is important in Vodou as in Christian art, but the Vodou symbol comes from Fon mythology rather than Christianity.\nIt represents Agwé, who corresponds to the Fon sea deity Agbê.\nAgbê took the shape of a fish when he was given responsibility for the sea.\n\nArt flags show much wider variation in size and theme than \"drapo servis\", and rarely have a fringe. Some flags are closer to tapestries.\nIn the 1950s collectors started to buy \"drapo Vodou\", and the \"oungan\" (priests) began to make them for sale as a source of income. \nThe next generation of artists, active in the 1990s, included Eviland Lalanne, Joseph Oldof Pierre, Le Petit Frere Mogirus, Wagler Vital, Georges Valris, Roland Rockville, Ronald Gouin, and Antoine Oleyant. They introduced various innovations, in part driven by the shortage of materials for flagmaking. Antoine Oleyant has been called \"the artist who really brought the flags into the realm of fine art.\"\n\nIn Port-au-Prince the skilled \"drapo\" artists have ready access to beads and sequins brought in from Canada and the United States. \nThese artists earn their living from sales to tourists and to art galleries.\nIn the 21st century there have been considerable changes to \"drapo Vodou\" as an art-form, in which artists such as Myrlande Constant have introduced new themes and techniques.\nOther contemporary \"drapo\" artists include Evelyne Alcide, Roudy Azor, Gabriel Chery, Lindor Chiler, Mireille Delice, Christian Dorleus and Josiane Joseph.\nTheir large and elaborate \"drapo\" represent in greater details the interactions with the \"lwas\" in events such as Vodou ceremonies and weddings.\nThey may also represent evangelical Christian themes, or have secular subjects. \nEdgard Jean Louis, a well-known flagmaker, made a flag called \"Diana Erzulie\" that included a photograph of the English Princess Diana.\nThere is growing demand for such \"drapo\" by international art collectors.\n\nIn the 1940s Haitian professional artists began to create imitations of images provided by foreign entrepreneurs. The images represented the foreigners' view of the essence of Vodou art. This interaction was later dismissed and the Haitian works were stated to be authentic.\nIn 1949 fifteen artists decorated the Episcopal Saint Trinite Cathedral in Port-au-Prince with murals that contrast Vodou art and traditional scenes from the bible.\nThirteen of the artists were Catholics and/or Vodouists.\nIn the 1950s the murals became world famous. African gods were found in the symbolism of Christian images. Thus the \"Damballah Virgin\" by Andre Dimanche was identified as Erzulie, a lwa connected to Aphrodite, Mater Dolorosa, health and an angry Madonna.\n\nA doll incorporated in a work of Vodou art can be animated so it can perform supernatural work, protecting the home. The Haitian Vodou priest Georges René explains the process, saying \"anything can do mystique if you believe in it... you have to turn it into mystic. You baptize it. You make a ceremony. You put the food the \"lwa\" eats... after that you can work with it. It gets a soul. You can put it on an altar.\"\n\nPierrot Barra (1942–99) and Marie Cassaise made sacred altar installations from everyday objects such as dolls, sunglasses, sequins, speedometers, rosaries, mirrors and tinsel.\nBarra said his work was inspired by the Vodou spirits, who sometimes demanded it. He said, \"When I sleep, while I'm dreaming, I see the Mysteries. When I sleep I see the spirits...they show me a design, some face, some kind of thing. Then when I wake up I create it.\"\nA visitor to Port-au-Prince in 1991 described an altar installation Barra made for the mother goddess Ezili Dantor. Her head came from a plaster doll, with rouge, lipstick and white synthetic hair. She held a cutout picture of the baby Jesus, which represented the goddess's daughter Anais.\nA red fabric snake was wrapped round the body of the goddess, and a small rubber baby doll was at the foot of the statue. The whole was decorated with sparkles and cheap jewelry. This was not a traditional design, but was immediately recognized by Vodouists as authentic Vodou art.\n\n"}
{"id": "2406127", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2406127", "title": "Halifax Pop Explosion", "text": "Halifax Pop Explosion\n\nThe Halifax Pop Explosion is a music festival and conference that takes place every fall, typically two weeks after Thanksgiving, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. The term \"Halifax Pop Explosion\" also came to be adopted in the 1990s as the name of the Halifax alternative rock music scene as a whole, which at that time was dominated by power pop acts such as Sloan, Jale, The Super Friendz and Thrush Hermit.\n\nFounded in 1993, the Halifax Pop Explosion has actually been three different events that are now remembered as one long standing event. The original Halifax Pop Explosion, which was operated as private business from 1993–1995, was created as a platform to celebrate Halifax's newfound fame as the \"Seattle of the North\" and home of Canadian grunge, as well as to promote local bands such as Sloan, The Inbreds, Jale, The Super Friendz and Thrush Hermit.\n\nThe company that organized the festival went out of business and a new organization launched the \"Halifax On Music Festival\", which ran successfully but not profitably for four years. The festival did not take place in 2000.\nIn 2001, Waye Mason, a past owner of the Halifax On Music Festival, created the not-for-profit Halifax Pop Explosion Association to operate the festival for the good of the music community, regardless of long term profitability. The festival name returned to the Halifax Pop Explosion and the event has doubled in size since 2001. The Festival has expanded its programming to support other genres within the independent music community as well as the power pop that it is best known for. By 2006 it was featuring acts from hip hop and electronica to folk rock and alt-country to punk and hardcore. With 180 plus bands in 20 venues all around town over five days the festival exhibits considerable breadth in presenting new music.\n\n\nThe Halifax Pop Explosion conference is held annually at the Halifax Central Library.\n\nThe XPAND Panel focuses on inclusivity in music and is typically free to the public and includes panels, forums, keynote speakers, songwriters, artists, industry leaders, music executives, and community leaders.\n\nThe Label Summit's purpose is to discuss issues within the music industry that are affecting labels and artists. The summit has delegates from around the world and is great for networking and career building.\n\nIndustry experts and artists looking for sync placements converse in one on one talks, roundtable discussions and networking mixers.\n\nPresented by Women In Music Canada and Music Ontario, the Mentor Cafe is for female-identifying and non-binary persons who are looking to meet and converse with female delegates.\n\nA disruption occurred during Lido Pimienta's concert at the festival on October 19, 2017. According to a statement that was released by the festival \"the incident involved a white volunteer photographer and several white audience members who reacted negatively when Pimienta invited 'brown girls to the front' during her Oct. 19 show\" (as reported by The Canadian Press). When the festival-sanctioned volunteer photographer, who was engaged in documenting the performance, refused to move after ten separate requests Pimienta said, \"You're cutting into my set time and you're disrespecting these women, and I don't have time for this\". The volunteer was removed from the show and the festival organizers apologized to Pimienta. A complaint has been filed with the Canadian Human Rights Commission. The Canadian government is now investigating.\n\nIn addition to the music, the Halifax Pop Explosion also continues to support a variety of independent arts and pop-culture events. The Indie Zine and Label Fair, which had been growing since 1996, was replaced in 2006 by three events: the #POPular Conference, a DIY and independent music-focused conference; Halifax Zine Fair, the Atlantic Canada edition of the zine fair and independent publishing event curated by Broken Pencil Magazine; and a series of art gallery exhibitions stage around town.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "59134195", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59134195", "title": "History of the Lurs", "text": "History of the Lurs\n\nLurs (also Lors) are an Iranian people living mainly in western and south-western Iran. There are also a significant population of Iraqi Lurs in eastern and central parts of Iraq, mainly known as Feylis. The word Luristan or Lorestan, is attributed to the areas inhabited by the Lurs. The boundaries of Luristan is begin from some eastern Iraqi plains and stretch to the west and southwest of Iran. Before the Safavid era, the limits of the name Lorestan was included the Feyli, Bakhtiari and Southern Lurish settlements. The Bakhtiari settlement was named Bakhtiari region, after the rule of the Safavids, and the geography of the Lorestan name was limited to the present provinces of Lorestan and Ilam. The area was also divided into two parts: Poshtkuh and Pishkuh, in the Qajar dynasty. Today, Lorestan is the name of one of the western provinces of Iran.\n\nThere are several disputes over the origin of the Lurs and they are believed to be from the Elamite and Kassite origin or a Medean or Persian tribe of Aryan origin. However, nowadays they speak an Iranian language and consider themselves as pure Iranians.\nThe first sighting of the word Lur is in the writings of some historians and geographers of the 10th century and later in the form of اللور, اللر and لور (Lur). Hamdallah Mustawfi in Tarikh-e gozida (1330 AD) referred to the settlement of Lurish tribes in Levant and then their mass migration towards the current Lurish-inhabited areas. There are several hypothesis that discuss the origin of the name Lur or Lor, prominent amongst them is its attribution to a person called Lur or Lohraseb and some believe that the name refers to the area of first settlement of this ethnic group. The word Ler or Lir (literally Forst or forest mountain) is a probable source for this word.\n\nLuristan is mainly a mountainous juicy and lush area with prosperous pasturages. There are several dominant tree species like oak, elm, walnut and almond around Luristan.\n\nThe ancient history of Lorestan is closely intertwined with the rest of the Ancient Near East. In the 3rd and 4th millennium BC, migrant tribes settled down in the mountainous area of the Zagros Mountains. The Kassites, an ancient people who spoke neither an Indo-European nor a Semitic language, originated in Lorestān. They would control Babylonia after the fall of the Old Babylonian Empire ca. 1531 BC and until ca. 1155 BC.\nIranian Medes invaded and settled in Luristan in the 2nd millennium BC. The Medes absorbed the indigenous inhabitants of the region, primarily the Kassites as well as the Gutians, by the time the area was conquered by the Persians in the 1st millennium BC.\nIn February 2017, archeological discoveries related to the Achaemenid era were made in Lorestan for the first time. The history of Aryan settlement in Luristan, precedes more than 1000 years BC. From the Indo-European ethnic groups, first, the Medes settled in areas known as Lorestan. Between 625 and 700 BC, other tribes like the Scythians settled in Lorestan.\nThe first people who ruled areas of Lorestan were Elamites. The extent of the influence of the Elamites has been to the present Mamassani area. They were indigenous peoples of Iran, but there is no proper knowledge of how communities are formed and the beginning of their history. However, They were able to establish a state before the arrival of Aryan ethnic groups in parts of western Iran.\nThe Elam government included Khuzestan, modern Lorestan, Poshtkuh (Ilam provice and some western Iraqi areas), Bakhtiari mountains and Southern Lurish settelment. Babylonians called the land of Elamites Elam or Elamto, meaning \"the mountain\" and perhaps \"the land of sunrise\".\nElamite is generally accepted to be a language isolate and thus unrelated to the much later arriving Persian and Iranic languages. In accordance to geographical and archaeological matching, historians argue that the Elamites to be the Proto-Lurs, whose language became Iranian only in the Middle Ages.\n\nThe major cities of the Elamites were Shush, Ahvaz, Madakto and Kheidalou. Walther Hinz believes that the current KhorramAbad in the era of the Elamites was the capital of a dynasty called Simashki.\nIn the course of several thousand years, the Elamites maintained their identity against strong tribes such as Sumerians, Akkadians, Babylonians, and Assyrians.\nEventually, they were defeated by their enemy of Assyria in 654 BC because of internal disputes and wars.\nThe rise of the Elamites and the formation of the Elamite government in the north of Khuzestan plain is the most important political event of Iran in the third millennium BC. Since then, before the arrival of the Medes and Persians, what we know from the history of the land of Iran is only the political history of Elamite.\n\nKassites entered to the Iranian plateau from the highlands of the Caucasus and Azerbaijan before the Aryan migration and then settled the southwest of Iran. Kassites along with Elam, dominated parts of Lorestan and had an extraordinary skill in making bronze artifacts. They were considered as the most important Zagros mountain tribes and were engaged to livestock breeding. They spoke in a language that was affiliated with Elamite.\nThey were brave and warrior riders and repeatedly entered into battle with their neighbors, including Elamites and Babylonians. They even managed to overthrow the government of Babylon and ruled theBabylon for six centuries. The rule of the Kassites in Babylonia ended as a result of their defeat from the Elamites. After the defeat from the Elamites, they returned to their mountainous land of Lorestan.\n\nDuring the rule of Achaemenid, Lorestan was part of the rule of the Kassites and when the Achaemenids moved from Babylon to Hamadan, they had to cross the Lorestan area and pay ransom to the Kassites. Pahle was the name of a vast land in west of Iran which was included many cities and areas in the current Zagros. The province of Pahla was named after the Sasanian times and the word Pahlavi refers to the people, the language, and the alphabet related to the this region. At the time of the Achaemenids, the current Lorestan, along with Ilam and Khuzestan, were the third state of this great empire. During the Parthian period, this land was one of the Satraps (states) of this dynasty anf finally, during the Sassanid period, the area was named \"Pahla\".\nIn spite of several resistance efforts, the Arab conquest of Iran, led to the end of the Sasanid Empire in 651 and the eventual decline of the Zoroastrian religion in Iran. Iran (including Lurish territory) was under the absolute sovereignty of Arabs for two centuries. Lur people, however, managed to maintain the language and many of their customs. Until the end of the third century AH, the district of Lorestan paid the taxes to Kufa and was directly governed by the Caliphs. Different free-seeking revolts led to gradual reestablishment of Iranian local dynasties in the beginning of the ninth century.\nAfter the Arab dominance, Luristan was under control of Hasanwayhids, Buyids and Seljuqids, respectively.\n\nBy the middle of the tenth century, the total Lurish-inhabited areas were known as Luristan. Along with the gradual weakening of Seljuks, several autonomous atabeg were formed across Iran. Luristan Atabegs or Hazaraspids established an autonomous state in the Lurish-inhabited areas. After that, the territory was divided into two parts: Lur-e-kuchek (Minor Luristan) and Lur-e-bozorg (Major Luristan). The former corresponded to modern Luristan and Ilam provinces and some areas in the current western Iraq while the latter included modern Bakhtiari, Kuhgiluye-Boir Ahmed, Mamasani and some coastal areas in Bushehr. In spite of all these invasions, the Lurs maintained their territorial integrity, absorbed the invaders, and eventually established two local dynasties known as Atabak or Atabeg during the twelfth century.\nHazaraspids (Atabaks of Luristan) is the name of Lur dynasty that ruled a large area of Iran for a long while (1148–1424). Their territory included almost all the current Lurish-inhabited regions. Luristan Atabeg then divided in two Atabegs; the Minor Luristan (Lore kučak) and the Major Luristan (Lore bozorg) with Khorram Abad and Idaj as their capitals, respectively.\n\nA big part of the Lurish areas came under the control of a local dynasty known as Lur-e bozorg Atabegs during the twelfth century. It was established in 1155 AD. The area under the control of major Luristan rulers (modern Bakhtiari, Kuhgiluyeh and Boyer Ahmed, Mamasani and parts of Khuzistan, Bushehr and Isfahan provinces) was included a vast territory extending from the Dez River in the north Khuzistan to the central areas of Fars in the southern Iran. In spite of evidences indicating the economic and social proserity, the Atabak dynasty finally extinct by Ibrahim Sultan ibn Shahrukh invasion in 1423. As a result, the territorial unity and the economic prosperity of the Major Luristan was terminated. The territory was divided into tribal sectins without a centralized coherence. During the Safavid period (1501–1750), Major Luristan was divided into three parts: the northern part became known as Bakhtiari, the central part as Kuhgilu, and the southern part as Mamasani.\n\nTraditionally the Minor Luristan corresponded to current provinces of Luristan and Ilam and some Feyli-inhabited areas in Iraq (belt of mountainous region stretching from the plains of the Tigris in the west to the Diz River in the east).Shojaeddin Khorshid establshed the dynasty as the Atabakan-i-Luristan, which lasted from 1184 to 1597. The rulers established their capital in Khorramabad (currently the provincial capital of Luristan province.\n\nThe Atabak dynasty was replaced by the Wali dynasty (1596–1929). The founder of the new dynasty was Husain Khan, whose father had married the aunt of the last Atabak, and on the basis of this kinship tie Husain Khan later received the position of ruler of Lur-j-kuchek. The Walis played a significant role in the political affairs of Iran. They guarded southwestern Iran against the Ottomans, who constantly attacked the western and southwestern borders of the country. Ali Mardan Khan was appointed the commander-in-chief of the entire Iranian armed forces dur downfall of the Safavids, when the country was invaded by the Afghans in the early eighteenth century (De Bode 1845).\n\nThe reign of the Walis coincided with several dynasties of Iran including: Safavid (1501–1736), Afshar (1736–1750), Zand (1750–1794), Qajar (1796–1925) and the beginning of the Pahlavi(1924–1929). The last two dynasties, namely the Qajar and Pahlavi, are responsible for the political weakness of the Lurs and the decline of the Wali dynasty. Thus, the Lurs maintained their political integrity under the Safavids and Afshars, while they ruled over Iran during the Zand dynasty. However, when the Qajars came to power, they divided Lur-i-kuchek into two parts, Luristan and Posht-kuh. From this time on, the domain of the Walis was limited to Posht-kuh only, while Luristan came under the direct control of the central government. Thus, a governor-general, usually a member of the royal family, was appointed by the king and sent to Luristan. Yet during the Qajar dynasty, Luristan was continually in a state of anarchy. The Qajars were unable to subdue the tribes of Luristan and hence, except for some short periods, there was no peace in Luristan. As a matter of fact, the Qajar dynasty lost total control over Luristan after the assassination of Nasir al-Din Shah in 1896. In short, the division of Lur-i-kuchek by the Qajar dynasty weakened the political strength of the Walis and reduced the Lurs' political influence. Furthermore, the inability of the Qajars to establish law and order in Luristan contributed to the expansion of pastoral nomadism and the destruction of settled communities. Consequently, Luristan suffered politically as well as economically under Qajar rule.\n\nThe Qajar dynasty was overthrown by Reza Khan, the founder of the Pahlavi dynasty, in 1925. The Pahlavi dynasty (1925–1979) is best characterized as a dictatorial monarchy with absolute rule, that is, the concentration of power in the monarch's hands. The regime built an army whose strength was without precedent in the history of Iran. The army was used against Lurs and other groups who refused to give up their power to the new regime. Through bloody confrontations between the new monarch and the Lurs (as well as other peoples in Iran), the Pahlavi dynasty eventually crushed the powers of the Lurs. Thus, Reza Shah ended the Wali dynasty of Posht-kuh, executed or exiled many of the Lur leaders, forcefully sedentarized the nomadic pastoral tribes and changed the territorial integrity of Lur-i-kuchek.\n\nWhile the Qajar dynasty was responsible for the spread of anarchy among the Lurs, the Pahlavi-dynasty was responsible for their political disorganization, social disruption and the loss of political freedom and semi-independent status. For the first time in their long history, the Lurs were stripped of their traditional rights and political freedom by the Pahlavi dynasty. When Reza Shah took power, he established a centralized government, transferring power from the provincial communities to Tehran. He carried out his plan through the use of military operations against various provincial communities, including the Lurs. A key element to Reza Shah's success was that the Lurs were not unified so he could attack each group separately. Furthermore, Reza Shah used one tribe to fight against another. As the Lurs were defeated, Reza Shah took the following measures to keep them under control: 1) tribal leaders were removed from their positions of authority and were replaced by military officials, 2) many of the leaders, were executed, imprisoned or exiled to other parts of Iran, 3) some tribes were exiled to distant lands, 4) all pastoral nomadic tribes, which formed the majority of the Lur population, were forceably sedentarized without sufficient provisions, 5) all tribesmen were disarmed, 6) the use of the traditional black tent was outlawed, 7) tribesmen were ordered to abandon their traditional costume and were forced to wear Western clothes; however, this rule was not totally carried out, and 8) governmental offices were established in order to carry out the state policies.\n\nThe above policies were intended to subjugate the Lurs to the central government. Reza Shah altered the traditional sociopolitical organization of the Lurs without providing opportunities for their participation in local or national government. Undoubtedly the establishment of the central state demanded the integration of various regions and ethnic groups. However, that need not entail political deprivation and the lack of respect for members of the different tribal or ethnic groups. Under the Pahlavi regime, however, the establishment of the modern state came to mean precisely that – the expansion of state domination and disruption of the traditional political organization without the slightest opportunity for peoples to participate in local or national politics.\n\nReza Shah was deposed by the British and Russians in 1941, and was replaced by his son Mohammed Reza Shah, who ruled from 1941 to 1979. The reign of Mohammed Reza Shah witnessed further centralization of state power and the disintegration of traditional political organization among the Lurs. The enforcement of the land reform program and the nationalization of the forests and pastureland (1962–63 along with various forces of modernization including the expansion of capitalism, urbanism and modern schooling gradually changed many aspects of the Lurs' culture.\n\nUnder the Pahlavi regime, the Lurs lost their freedom and their semi-independent status, and the Lurs' territories were divided into several administrative units without any regard for traditional boundaries. For instance, Lur-i-kuchek has been limited to modern Luristan while Posht-kuh, formerly ruled by the Wali dynasty, was incorporated into Ilam province. The most dramatic change caused by the Pahlavi regime was the loss of freedom and the semi-independent status of the Lurs. Prior to the establishment of the Pahlavi Regime, basic decisions were made within the local communities. For instance, the Bakhtiari was ruled by a local dynasty who paid certain tributes to the central government, while internal affairs were taken care of by the members of that dynasty. In Luristan, each tribal group acted as a semi-independent unit. In Posht-kuh, the Walis were supreme, while the tribes of Kuh-Gilu-Boir Ahmed and those of Mamasani also enjoyed the same internal freedom. The Pahlavi regime, however, sent high-ranking officials from Tehran to supervise the Lur territories. Just prior to the recent revolution, all governors-general were directly appointed by the Shah without taking into consideration the existence of the Lurs' communities. Lurs, like other Iranians, were prohibited from organizing political parties, forming associations or expressing themselves through mass media and public gatherings.\n\nSecond, Iranian oil is extracted from the mountain slopes of Luristan, Bakhtiari and Kuh-Gilu-Boir Ahmed provinces, but the Lurs were deprived from their share of oil revenue, particularly during the reign of Mohammed Reza Shah. The money derived from oil went to the pockets of the Tehranis, creating regional economic inequalities.\n\nThird, despite the fact that the Pahlavi regime provided elementary and, to some extent, secondary education for the Lurs, it failed to provide them with opportunities for higher education. Until a few years prior to the revolution, not a single institution of higher education was established among the Lurs, nor were they given scholarships or financial support. The Pahlavi regime was thus responsible for depriving the Lurs of access to higher and prestigious positions. High-ranking Lur families were the only exceptions; they could afford to send their children to universities either in Iran or outside the country.\n\nModern education was used during the Pahlavi rule as a way to undermine local cultural values. School curriculum was prepared in Tehran without taking the cultural diversity among the Iranian peoples into consideration. Not a single course in the entire elementary, high school or university curricula reflected the history, geography or sociocultural values of the Lurs.\n\nIn sum, the Lurs lost their sociopolitical integrity under the Pahlavi dynasty. They were integrated into the \"modern\" state without any opportunity for effective participation in the decision-making process that affected their lives.\n\nIt is too early to evaluate the sociopolitical conditions of the Lurs under the present regime. So far, political parties, associations and local newspapers have not yet emerged. Administrative boundaries of the Lurs' territories remain unchanged from those of the Pahlavi regime. While it is difficult to speculate about the future of the Lurs under the current regime, considering the fact that the present regime is concerned more with an Islamic community rather than with a country of diverse ethnic groups, it seems unlikely that there will be considerable change in the near future.\n"}

They became especially popular in England from the mid-19th century until their general decline alongside the use of the draft horse, and remain a collectors item today. \n\nPhalera is the archaeological term for equivalent disks, which were popular in Iron Age Europe, including Ancient Rome. \n\nIn ancient Rome, horse harnesses were sometimes embellished with horse brasses known as \"phalerae\", normally in bronze, cut or cast in the shape of a boss, disk, or crescent, most often used in pairs on a harness. In medieval England, decorative horse brasses were in use before the 12th century, serving as talismans and status symbols, but extensive, original research by members of the National Horse Brass Society has shown that there is no connection whatsoever between these bronze amulets to the working-class harness decorations used in the mid-19th century which developed as part of a general flowering of the decorative arts following the Great Exhibition. \n\nThere are a great deal of die-hard, unfounded myths surrounding these decorations such as their usage as amulets to ward off the \"evil eye\". The most popular size is 3 × 3½ inches of flat brass with a hanger by which the brass is threaded onto a horse harness strap, known as a Martingale. In England many of these items of harness found their way into country public houses as the era of the heavy horse declined, and are still associated today as a pub decoration. By the late 19th century heavy horses were decorated with brasses of all kinds and sizes. During this era working horse parades were popular throughout the British Isles and prize or merit awards were given, some by the Royal Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA). Horse brasses were often highly prized by the \"carters\", who decorated their horse with them. Other horse brass subjects include advertising, royalty commemoration, and in later years, souvenir brasses for places and events, many of which are still being made and used today.\n\nCollecting horse brasses for their own sake other than as decorations for harness seems to have commenced around 1880, when women bought the newly issued, pierced-design, die-struck brasses which were used for pin-cushions. A little later these were often used as fingerplates on doors which can be corroborated by accounts in the trade magazine, \"Saddler and Harness\" by the veteran saddler William Albery or Horsham in Sussex. From 1890 onward, collecting the various types of brass, i.e. face-pieces, swingers, and hame-plates, etc., became a highly popular pastime amongst the upper and middle classes. Indeed, the collecting of these humble brasses became especially popular amongst academics with many famous, early collections being formed by public schoolmasters and other prominent professionals, such as A.H. Tod, a Master at Charterhouse School and Dr Kirk of Pickering in Yorkshire, whose collection is still housed at the York Castle Museum in York. The writing about such items also commenced c.1890s and was dominated by much Victorian romanticism surrounding the supposed, esoteric origin and ancient, unbroken lineage of these decorations. Such myths include their origin as talismanic symbols being brought back to England by homecoming knights returning from the Crusades, or in later years, by migrating romany, though, once again, absolutely no evidence has ever been offered in support of these theories.\n\nWhatever the views of individual collectors as to when or where working-horse harness decoration first began in the British Isles, most collectors agree that cast brasses were the first to appear on the scene. Opinion is also still divided as to how, even these, originated, but once again, most collectors nowadays, are in agreement that the earliest decorations were simple, cast studs in a variety of shapes and sizes. The earliest types were probably even made locally by smiths or other skilled artisans but by the second half of the 19th century the production of such things had evolved from a local, decorative cult into a national fashion with the bulk of their production centred in and around the West Midlands.\n\nStamped brasses on heavy horse harness appeared on the scene around 1880, with a small number occurring perhaps a decade or so earlier, and it is highly likely that the process developed from one that was already established in the manufacture of carriage harness trappings and military insignia. However, production of these appears to have peaked shortly before the First World War, and since the 1920s, a few types have been produced but their quality is rather poor being made from thinner gauge brass sheet. Due to serious considerations of the sheer weight of cast harness decorations carried by working horses (first raised by the early animal welfare movements in the late 19th century) it is thought that the first stamped brasses were made as a lighter (and cheaper), alternative to cast brasses being later exported throughout the British Empire. Unlike their cast cousins, stamped brasses were not made in moulds, but pressed out of rolled sheet brass approximately 1/16 in thickness although other gauges of sheet than earlier examples. Due to the ease of their manufacture, many thousands of these stamped types were produced, but there are some that are very rare.\n\nThe production of both cast and stamped brasses has continued since the demise of the British working horse but their manufacture is mainly centred on the souvenir trade, and other specialist manufacturers who provide for the heavy horse world who still breed and show the various breeds.\n\nThe National Horse Brass Society of England has members all over the world and provides publications for members and swap meets.\n\n"}
{"id": "7280529", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7280529", "title": "Japanese incense", "text": "Japanese incense\n\nThe burning of incense in Japan began during the 6th century (the Asuka period) with the introduction of Buddhism, which uses incense during rituals and ceremonies. Agarwood was imported into Japan from China via Korea. From that point on, incense would become an important facet of Japanese culture. Incense is used for a variety of purposes, including Buddhist ceremonies, spirituality and meditation.\n\nThere are two major types of incense in Japan, which are either heating or smouldering small pieces of fragrant wood, or direct-burning incense in form of sticks or cones formed out of paste without a bamboo stick.\n\nMany of the current incense companies have been in existence for more than 300 years.\n\nThe word incense (\"kō\") in Japan is written in the Chinese Kangxi radical 186 composed of nine strokes, 香, which can also be expanded up to 27 strokes 馫. A literal translation is \"fragrance\", though in context it is understood as \"incense\". The word 道 \"dō\" may be added, which means \"way\", both literally (street) and metaphorically (a stream of life experience), to give kōdō: the \"way of incense\", which involves using incense within a structure of codified conduct.\n\n\"Nihon Shoki\", a book of classical Japanese history, gives the first formal record of incense in Japan when a log of agarwood, a fragrant wood used in incense burning, drifted ashore on Awaji Island during the Asuka period in 595 CE, and was presented to Prince Shōtoku and the Empress Suiko. Shōtoku knew of incense burning from Buddhism, which had been introduced into Japan around 538 CE; incense was part of Buddhist ritual, and was imported into Japan from China through Korea. Agarwood was imported in 538 CE during the building of a temple. A ritual known as \"sonaekō\" became established. \"Koboku\" fragrant wood combined with herbs and other aromatic substances was burned to provide a fragrant incense for religious purposes. The custom of burning incense was further developed and blossomed amongst the court nobility with the pastime of \"takimono\", a powdered mixture of aromatic substances. Fragrant scents played a vital role at court life during the Heian period, robes and even fans were perfumed and poems written about them, it also featured prominently in the epic The Tale of Genji in the 11th century. \n\nSamurai warriors would prepare for battle by purifying their minds and bodies with the incense of \"koboku\"; developing an appreciation for its fragrances. In the late Muromachi period in the 16th century, this aesthetic awareness would develop into the accomplishment known as kōdō, which is the art of enjoying the incense of smouldering \"koboku\". The present style of kōdō has largely retained the structure and manner of the Muromachi period, in which time the tea ceremony and the \"ikebana\" style of flower arrangement developed as well.\n\nDuring the Tenshō era in the late 16th century, the master craftsmen Kōju was employed at the Kyoto Imperial Palace and practiced incense ceremony. The third Kōju served under Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the fourth under Tokugawa Ieyasu. The eighth Kōju Takae Jyuemon was known as a particular master of incense of note. \nDuring this time the “Ten Virtues of Kō” (香の十徳, \"kōnojūtoku\") were formulated, which is a traditional listing of the benefits derived from the proper and correct use of quality incense:\n\n\nEven today, there is a strong relationship and holistic approach in kōdō between fragrant scent, the senses, the human spirit, and nature. The spirituality and refined concentration that is central to kōdō places it on the same level as kadō and chadō.\n\nThe start of the Edo period in the 19th century saw major changes in the history and production of incense. Senkō incense sticks became more widely available to the general public as production method shifted to an industrial scale. At the start of the 20th century, mainichi-kō, or \"everyday incense\" was developed by the master craftsman Kitō Yujiro during the Meiji and Taishō era. \n\nToday companies such as Nippon Kodo, Shoyeido, and Baieido are some of the most established suppliers for incense.\n\nThe fragrant woods agarwood and sandalwood are the main ingredients used in Japanese incense. Agarwood is produced in certain parts of southeast Asia such as Vietnam. Japanese incense companies divide agarwood into six categories depending on the region obtained and properties of the agarwood. The trees secrete an aromatic resin, which over time turns into kōboku. One particular grade of kōboku with a high oil content and superior fragrance is called kyara. Kyara is currently worth more than its weight in gold. Sandalwood originates primarily from India, Indonesia, southern China or other parts of southeast Asia. Sandalwood trees need around 60 years to produce their signature fragrance that can be deemed acceptable to be used for kōdo. The most valued sandalwood comes from Mysore in the state of Karnataka in India, where it is endangered. Makkō (which translates as \"incense powder\") is used to bind the ingredients together. It is able to bind ingredients while having little scent of its own.\n\nOther materials used are cinnamon bark, chebulic myrobalan, clove, ginger lily, lavender, licorice, patchouli, spikenard, camomile, rhubarb, safflower, star anise, and other herbs. Shell fragrances and other animal-derived aromatic materials are also used. \n\nRaw materials such as agarwood are becoming increasingly rare due to the depletion of the wild resource. This has made prime material very expensive. For example, the cost of lower grade \"kyara\" is about 20,000 yen per gram. Top quality \"kyara\" costs over 40,000 yen per gram, or many times the equivalent weight of gold (as of late 2012). If the particular piece of incense wood has a history, the price can be even higher. The highest regarded wood, ranjyatai, dates back to at least the 10th century and is \"kyara\" wood from Laos or Vietnam, and was used by emperors and warlords for its fragrance. It is said to contain so much resin that it can be used many times over. The wood is kept at the Shōsōin treasury in Nara, which is under the administration of the Imperial Household. The high costs and difficulty in obtaining acceptable raw material is one of the reasons why kōdō is not as widely practised or known compared to the art of flower arrangement or the tea ceremony.\n\nSasaki Dōyō (1306–1373), who was regarded as a paragon of elegance and luxury and the quintessential military aristocrat during Nanboku-chō period, owned many incense woods and named them.\n\n\"Shōgun\" Ashikaga Yoshimasa (1436–1490) himself appreciated precious scented woods and collected some or inherited them from Sasaki. In order to properly organise the large collection of incense wood, he appointed the experts of that time Sanjonishi Sanetaka, who became the founder of the Oie School, and Shino Soshin, the founder of the Shino School. They established a classifying system called \"rikkoku gomi\", which means \"six countries, five scents\". \n<nowiki>*</nowiki> \"Manaban\" comes from the word \"nanban\" which means \"southern barbarian\", and was brought to Japan by Portuguese traders with unknown origin.\n\nOne of the oldest traditional incense companies in Japan is Baieido, founded in 1657 with roots going back to the Muromachi period. Other traditional and still operating companies include Kyukyodo (1663, Kyoto), and Shoyeido, founded in 1705 in Kyoto. Nippon Kodo is also a major supplier of incense material.\n\nBoth Baieido and Shoyeido are used extensively by Zen Buddhist temples, both in Japan and worldwide. Nippon Kōdō was established by incorporation in New York City in August 1965 and is the largest seller of Japanese incense worldwide. Most of their incense is \"everyday\" quality (毎日 mainichi). They do make some \"traditional\" incense as well. These three are the major exporters of Japanese incense.\n\nCurrently, 70% of all of Japan's incense is manufactured on a small island south of Osaka called Awaji Island. The history extends back to 1850 in Ei of the city of Awaji in 1850 when Senshuu Sakai manufacturing technology was introduced. At the time, Ei was a military run trade port for the Tokushima Clan, which opened the door to the import and sale of raw materials used in making incense. Over time, the incense made in Awaji Island became renowned throughout Japan. The main reason incense manufacturing took root in Awaji Island is because of its nishi-kaze (west wind). This strong seasonal wind hampers the fishing industry, giving rise to the necessity for cottage industries such as incense making. This wind is also great for drying incense.\n\nKyūkyodō, Kunmeidō, and Kōkandō also sell some incense overseas. It may be difficult to find the other brands outside Japan. There are numerous other incense makers in Japan, of course. These are the either the major sellers or the oldest companies in Japan.\n\n\"Kōdō\" () is the Japanese art of appreciating incense, similar to the tea ceremony, in which participants follow established practises involving the preparation and enjoyment of incense. Though it is counted as one of the three classical arts of refinement, it is relatively unknown amongst modern Japanese people. Kōdō includes all aspects of the incense process – from the tools (), which, much like tools of the tea ceremony, are valued as high art, to activities such the incense-comparing games kumikō and genjikō. \n\nFor kumikō, participants sit near one another and take turns smelling incense from a censer as they pass it around the group. Participants comment on and make observations about the incense, and play games to guess the incense material. Genjikō is one such game, in which participants are to determine which of five prepared censers contain different scents, and which contain the same scent. Players' determinations (and the actual answers) are recorded using \"genji-mon\" linear patterns, the elements of which allude to chapters in the \"Tale of Genji\".\n\nApart from kōdō, incense can also be used during the tea ceremony or other functions. A variety of containers and censers, or kōro, made out of porcelain, wood, lacquer or other materials were created over the centuries for this purpose, such as kōgō, and kōbako, all of which can be supremely valuable items.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "34384656", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34384656", "title": "Metafunction", "text": "Metafunction\n\nThe term \"metafunction\" originates in systemic functional linguistics and is considered to be a property of all languages. Systemic functional linguistics is functional and semantic rather than formal and syntactic in its orientation. As a functional linguistic theory, it claims that both the emergence of grammar and the particular forms that grammars take should be explained “in terms of the functions that language evolved to serve”. While languages vary in how and what they do, and what humans do with them in the contexts of human cultural practice, all languages are considered to be shaped and organised in relation to three functions, or metafunctions. Michael Halliday, the founder of systemic functional linguistics, calls these three functions the \"ideational\", \"interpersonal\", and \"textual\". The ideational function is further divided into the \"experiential\" and \"logical\".\n\nMetafunctions are \"systemic clusters\"; that is, they are groups of semantic systems that make meanings of a related kind. The three metafunctions are mapped onto the structure of the clause. For this reason, systemic linguists analyse a clause from three perspectives. Halliday argues that the concept of metafunction is one of a small set of principles that are necessary to explain how language works; this concept of function in language is necessary to explain the organisation of the semantic system of language. Function is considered to be \"a fundamental property of language itself\".\n\nAccording to Ruqaiya Hasan, the metafunctions in SFL \"are not hierarchised; they have equal status, and each is manifested in every act of language use: in fact, an important task for grammatics is to describe how the three metafunctions are woven together into the same linguistic unit\". Hasan argues that this is one way in which Halliday's account of the functions of language is different from that of Karl Bühler, for example, for whom functions of language are hierarchically ordered, with the referential function the most important of all. For Buhler, the functions were considered to operate one at a time. In SFL, the metafunctions operate simultaneously, and any utterance is a harmony of choices across all three functions.\n\nThe ideational function is language concerned with building and maintaining a theory of experience. It includes the experiential function and the logical function.\n\nThe experiential function refers to the grammatical choices that enable speakers to make meanings about the world around us and inside us:\n\nHalliday argues that it was through this process of humans making meaning from experience that language evolved. Thus, the human species had to “make sense of the complex world in which it evolved: to classify, or group into categories, the objects and events within its awareness”. These categories are not given to us through our senses; they have to be “construed”. In taking this position on the active role of grammar in construing “reality”, Halliday was influenced by Whorf.\n\nHalliday describes the logical function as those systems “which set up logical–semantic relationships between one clausal unit and another” The systems which come under the logical function are and . When two clauses are combined, a speaker chooses whether to give both clauses equal status, or to make one dependent on the other. In addition, a speaker choose some meaning relation in the process of joining or binding clauses together. Halliday argues that the meanings we make in such processes are most closely related to the experiential function. For this reason, he puts the experiential and logical functions together into the ideational function.\n\nThe interpersonal function refers to the grammatical choices that enable speakers to enact their complex and diverse interpersonal relations. This tenet of systemic functional linguistics is based on the claim that a speaker not only talks about something, but is always talking to and with others. Language not only construes experience, but simultaneously acts out “the interpersonal encounters that are essential to our survival”. Halliday argues that these encounters:\n\nThe grammatical systems that relate to the interpersonal function include Mood, Modality, and Polarity.\n\nHalliday argues that both experiential and interpersonal functions are intricately organized, but that between the two “there is comparatively very little constraint”. This means that “by and large, you can put any interactional ‘spin’ on any representational content”. What allows meanings from these two modes to freely combine is the intercession of a third, distinct mode of meaning that Halliday refers to as the textual function. The term encompasses all of the grammatical systems responsible for managing the flow of discourse. These systems “create coherent text – text that coheres within itself and with the context of situation” They are both structural (involving choices relating to the ordering of elements in the clause), and non-structural (involving choices that create cohesive ties between units that have no structural bond). The relevant grammatical systems include Theme, Given and New, as well as the systems of cohesion, such as Reference, Substitution, and Ellipsis. Halliday argues that the textual function is distinct from both the experiential and interpersonal because its object is language itself. Through the textual function, language “creates a semiotic world of its own: a parallel universe, or ‘virtual reality’ in modern terms”.\n"}

The sculpture depicts a woman—personifying Nature—removing a veil to reveal her face and bare breasts. The sculpture, which is in the Musée d'Orsay, was commissioned for the Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers. Underneath the veil, Nature wears a gown held up by a scarab. The figure is made of marble, with the gown made of Algerian onyx, and the scarab of malachite. The sculpture has also been reproduced in other media. \n\nAccording to historians of science Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison, the sculpture \"blends the ancient trope of the veil of Isis, interpreted as nature's desire to hide her secrets, with the modern fantasy of (female) nature willingly revealing herself to the (male) scientist, without violence or artifice.\" According to historian of science Carolyn Merchant, the sculpture is emblematic of transformation of conceptions of nature that came with the Scientific Revolution: \"From an active teacher and parent, she [Nature] has become a mindless, submissive body.\" In a similar vein, biologist and essayist Gerald Weissmann has noted the similarity between Nature's pose in Barrias' sculpture and that of the central figure in the 1876 painting \"Dr. Pinel Unchaining the Mad\" by Tony Robert-Fleury, a released inmate from an insane asylum who has \"the detached look of the very lost.\" Literary critic Elaine Showalter imagines a companion piece depicting Science would consist of \"a fully clothed man, whose gaze [is] bold, direct, and keen, the penetrating gaze of intellectual and sexual mastery\".\n\n"}

{"id": "33894006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33894006", "title": "Pagan studies", "text": "Pagan studies\n\nPagan studies is the multidisciplinary academic field devoted to the study of contemporary Paganism, a broad assortment of modern religious movements, which are typically influenced by or claiming to be derived from the various pagan beliefs of premodern Europe. Pagan studies embrace a variety of different scholarly approaches to studying such religions, drawing from history, sociology, anthropology, archaeology, folkloristics, theology and other religious studies.\n\nThe earliest academic studies of contemporary Paganism were published between 1970 and 1980 by scholars like Margot Adler, Marcello Truzzi and Tanya Luhrmann, although it would not be until the 1990s that the actual Pagan studies discipline properly developed, pioneered by academics such as Graham Harvey and Chas S. Clifton. Increasing academic interest in Paganism has been attributed to the new religious movement's increasing public visibility, as it began interacting with the interfaith movement and holding large public celebrations at sites such as Stonehenge.\n\nThe first academic conference on the subject was held at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, North-East England in 1993, followed three years later by a larger conference organised by the University of Lancaster in North-West England. Annual gatherings of the Conference on Current Pagan Studies and the Contemporary Pagan Studies Unit of the American Academy of Religion continue to develop scholarship in this field. In 2004, a peer-reviewed academic journal devoted to the discipline, \"The Pomegranate\", began publication. Many books on the subject have been published by a variety of different academic publishing companies, while AltaMira Press began publication of the Pagan Studies Series.\n\nThe relationship between Pagan studies scholars and the contemporary Pagan community which it studies has at times been strained, with some practitioners rejecting academic interpretations of their faiths. At the same time, many academics involved in Pagan studies are practicing Pagans themselves, bringing an insider's perspective to their approaches.\n\nPagan studies scholar Chas S. Clifton argued that the discipline had developed as a result of the increasing \"academic acknowledgement\" of contemporary Paganism's \"movement into the public eye\", referring to the emergence of Pagan involvement with interfaith groups and the Pagan use of archaeological monuments as \"sacred sites\", particularly in the United Kingdom. Clifton also argued that the development of Pagan studies was necessary to \"set forth an audacious redefinition of the term \"pagan\" as Michael York has done\", something which Clifton felt \"gives us room to reexamine from fresh perspectives all manifestation of ancient Pagan religions\".\n\nThe first international academic conference on the subject of Pagan studies was held at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, North-East England in 1993. It had been organised by two British religious studies scholars, Graham Harvey and Charlotte Hardman. In April 1996 a larger conference dealing with contemporary Paganism took place at Ambleside in the Lake District, organised by the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Lancaster, North-West England. Titled \"Nature Religion Today: Western Paganism, Shamanism and Esotericism in the 1990s\", it led to the publication of an academic anthology, \"Nature Religion Today: Paganism in the Modern World\". In that anthology, some of the conference's organisers described its original intentions, remarking that through it they \"sought to explore the innovations in practice and belief which constitute contemporary Paganism, and which appear to be a part of a widespread cultural response to the decay of main-line religions and to a widely felt awareness of ecological crisis.\"\n\nThat same year saw the beginnings of \"The Pomegranate\", which would later be transformed into a peer-reviewed academic journal, which first appeared in 2004.\n\nOne of the books AltaMira released was \"Researching Paganisms\", an anthology edited by Jenny Blain, Douglas Ezzy and Graham Harvey in which different Pagan studies scholars discussed their involvement with the subject and the opposition that they have faced.\n\nEthan Doyle White noted that as Pagan studies reached its twentieth year, it came under \"increasing pressure to explain itself, both to academia and to the Pagan community that it studies.\"\n\nIn 1979, the American sociologist, journalist and Wiccan Margot Adler published \"Drawing Down the Moon\", a sociological study of the Pagan movement across the United States, covering Wiccans, Druids, Goddess Worshipers, Heathens and Radical Faeries.\n\nIn 1999, the American sociologist Helen A. Berger of West Chester University published \"A Community of Witches\", a sociological study of the Wiccan and Pagan movement in the north-eastern United States.\n\nIn 2003, the British religious studies scholar Michael York published \"Pagan Theology: Paganism as a World Religion\", in which he argued that contemporary Paganism could be seen as a part of a much wider global \"paganism\" which encompassed a large variety of animistic and polytheistic religious traditions, including Indigenous religions. In 2005, ABC-CLIO published an anthology entitled \"Modern Paganism in World Cultures\", which was edited by the American religious studies scholar Michael F. Strmiska.\n\nAmong the first scholars to study contemporary Paganism from a historical perspective was the American Wiccan Aidan Kelly, who had been a founding member of the New Reformed Orthodox Order of the Golden Dawn and the Covenant of the Goddess during the 1970s. Having attained several academic qualifications, including in the field of religious studies, in the 1970s he began a study of the religious texts of Gardnerian Wicca, in order to establish a historical chronology for the tradition. The results of his study would only be published in 1991, as \"Crafting the Art of Magic\". This would later be rewritten and republished in 2007 as \"Inventing Witchcraft\".\n\nThe prominent English historian Ronald Hutton of the University of Bristol later devoted the latter part of his book \"The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles\" (1991) to an examination of the contemporary Pagan religions that took these pre-Christian religions as a core influence. He followed this with several studies of British folk customs, but in 1999 returned to the field of Pagan studies when he published \"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft\", the first academic study of Wiccan history.\n\nPagan studies has been charged with failing to properly define \"paganism\", as some scholars use it solely to designate contemporary Paganism and others – like Michael York and Chas Clifton – using it to refer to a wide range of religious movements across the world and throughout history. A further problem arises from the fact that while Pagan studies scholars might adopt \"paganism\" in reference to pre-Christian belief systems in Europe, the term was increasingly rejected by archaeologists specialising in those belief systems.\n\nPagan studies has failed to satisfactorily define \"contemporary Paganism\"; a minority of scholars have treated it as a singular religion within which groups like Wicca and Heathenry are denominations, while a larger group have instead treated it as a \"group of comparative religions\". The concern has been made that Pagan studies scholars would be \"at a loss to convey (to ourselves and to others), what it is that we are actually studying. The current situation, in which widely differing definitions are being used in tandem, is clearly unsustainable.\"\n\nReligious studies scholar Markus Altena Davidsen published a critique of the field in 2012, via a review of the \"Handbook of Contemporary Paganism\". Ethan Doyle White in \"The Pomegranate\", arguing that there were flaws in Davidsen's approach. Arguing that the \"Handbook of Contemporary Paganism\" was not as symptomatic of the field as Davidsen had assumed, he goes on to identify a number of factual errors within Davidsen's paper. Doyle White argued that Davidsen's division of scholars into firmly insider and outsider categories was problematic as scholars of Pagan studies like Sabina Magliocco straddled both boundaries, an approach based in the methodologies employed in anthropology.\n\nThe relationship between Pagan studies scholars and some practicing Pagans has at times been strained. The Australian academic and practicing Pagan Caroline Jane Tully argued that as a result of cognitive dissonance, many Pagans can react negatively to new scholarship regarding historical pre-Christian societies, believing that it is a threat to the structure of their beliefs and \"sense of identity.\" She furthermore argued that some of those dissatisfied Pagans lashed out against academics as a result, particularly on the internet.\n\n"}

The Tibetan equivalent is known as Thangka.\n\nMost paubhas show Buddhist subjects, but a few have Hindu themes. The paintings are made to earn religious merit both for the artist and the patron. Newar Buddhists commission artists to paint paubhas which are displayed during festivals and other special occasions. The traditional painters of paubhas are the Chitrakar caste who are known as Pun (पुं) in Nepal Bhasa. \n\nA paubha of Amitabha Buddha at the Los Angeles County Museum is believed to be the earliest specimen which is done in a style dating from the 11th century. \n\nPaubhas are painted on a rectangular piece of canvas. It is prepared by applying a mixture of buffalo glue and white clay on it. The surface is then rubbed with a smooth stone to give it polish. The painting is done according to the rules and dimensions handed down by tradition, and artists cannot exercise their creativity. \n\nThe paint is made from minerals and plants. Gold and silver paint are also used on paubhas. The eyes of the deity are painted when the rest of the painting has been completed, and is known as \"mikhā chāyekegu\" (opening the eyes). Brocade is sewn to the edge of the paubha to make a frame for display.\n\nFrom a composition perspective, the surface of Paubha is usually occupied of a large figure in the center that is placed inside a shrine and surrounded by registers of smaller figures on the sides; the background is usually filled in with natural elements such as rocks rendered in abstract patterns. The color is often deep and subdued with subtle shadings of the figures and exquisite renderings of details that are the hallmarks of early Nepalese paubhas\n\nAn annual exhibition of statues of Dipankara Buddha and paubhas is held in sacred courtyards in the Kathmandu Valley. The ceremony is known as Bahidyah Bwayegu (बहीद्यः ब्वयेगु), and is held during the month of Gunla. Gunla, which corresponds to August, is a holy month for Newar Buddhists. Groups of devotees led by musical bands make a tour of the courtyards to view the displays. In recent times, the traditional exhibitions have become fewer and shorter due to fear of art thieves.\n"}

Clifford Geertz, considered a founding member of postmodernist anthropology, advocates that, “anthropological writings are themselves interpretations, and second and third ones to boot” In the 21st century, some anthropologists use a form of standpoint theory; a person's perspective in writing and cultural interpretation of others is guided by their own background and experiences.\n\nOther major tenets of postmodernist anthropology are: \n\nA critique by non-anthropologists has been to question whether anthropologists may speak/write on behalf of cultural others. Margery Wolf states that, “it would be as great a loss to have first-world anthropologists confine their research to the first world as it is (currently) to have third-world anthropologists confine theirs to the third world”. In the 21st century, the question has been resolved by pointing out that all cultural descriptions are of cultural others. All ethnographic writing is done by a person from one standpoint writing about others living in a different standpoint. Thus, the notion of anthropologists as 'culture brokers' (see Richard Kurin) has been adopted to explain why anthropologists from any given country write about cultural others.\n\nIndian reformer John Collier in 1920-22 studied the Taos Pueblo In New Mexico, with an architecture and culture stretching back centuries. It made a lasting impression on Collier. He now saw the Indian world as morally superior to American society, which he considered to be \"physically, religiously, socially, and aesthetically shattered, dismembered, directionless.\" Collier came under attack for his romantic views about the moral superiority of traditional society as opposed to modernity. Collier became the main architect of the Indian New Deal 1933-45. He employed the perspectives we now call postmodern to reverse the long-standing national policy of compulsory assimilation of Native Americans. He enlisted numerous anthropologists in the 1930s and 1940s to support his position. Philp says after his experience at the Taos Pueblo, Collier \"made a lifelong commitment to preserve tribal community life because it offered a cultural alternative to modernity...His romantic stereotyping of Indians often did not fit the reality of contemporary tribal life.\"\n"}

Such efforts seek to communicate with foreign publics in order to establish a dialogue designed to inform and influence. Instruments of public diplomacy in the Islamic Republic of Iran include cultural exchanges, film and print media, and sports diplomacy.\n\nThere is no standard definition of public diplomacy.\nPublic Diplomacy is that \"form of international Political Advocacy in which the civilians of one country use legitimate means to reach out to the civilians of another country in order to gain popular support for negotiations occurring through diplomatic channels.\"\n\nThe United States Information Agency, the predecessor to the U.S. State Department's Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs, defines as public diplomacy as efforts that seek \"to promote the national interest of … through understanding, informing and influencing foreign audiences.\"\nThe U.S. State Department's \"Dictionary of International Relations Terms\" defines public diplomacy as anything that \"refers to government-sponsored programs intended to inform or influence public opinion in other countries; its chief instruments are publications, motion pictures, cultural exchanges, radio and television.\" \n\nMichael McClellan, one time Public Diplomacy Counselor for the U.S. Embassy Dublin, notes that \"public diplomacy [is] the strategic planning and execution of informational, cultural and educational programming by an advocate country to create a public opinion environment in a target country or countries that will enable target country political leaders to make decisions that are supportive of advocate country's foreign policy objectives.\"\n\nThe distinguishing factor between diplomacy and public diplomacy is the target audience. Where traditional diplomacy focuses on governments communicating with one another, public diplomacy seeks to engage foreign citizens and publics in order to change opinions and perceptions. Public diplomacy may present a point of view that differs than that of the targeted population's home government. In such cases, critics argue that public diplomacy is a new word for influence operations and/or propaganda.\n\nThe U.S. Department of State defines cultural diplomacy as the \"linchpin of public diplomacy; for it is in cultural activities that a nation's idea of itself is best represented.\" Further, cultural diplomacy seeks to demonstrate national values which might be shared with foreign audiences.\n\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran relies on its cultural heritage and exchanges as a basis for its public diplomacy campaign. Researchers state that culture forms a considerable part of Iran's soft power and Tehran actively utilizes public diplomacy instruments for its enhancement.\n\nThe Islamic Culture and Relations Organization, subordinate to the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, is the Islamic Republic of Iran's primary organization for implementing and leading cultural outreach outside of Iran. The purpose of the ICRO is to promote \"cultural ties with other nations and communities; consolidation of cultural ties of the Islamic republic of Iran with other nations; [offer] proper presentation of the Iranian culture and civilization; preparing the grounds for unity among Muslims; revival and promotion of Islamic culture and teachings in the world; and information dissemination about the principles and realities of the Islamic Revolution.\" The Islamic Culture and Relations Organization is Iran's de facto public diplomacy organization.\n\nSelected Islamic Culture and Relations Organization activities include:\nThe Iran Friendship Association seeks to target prominent members of the Albanian business, political, and scientific communities. Created by Alibeman Eghbali Zarch, former Iranian Ambassador to Albania, the Iran Friendship Association has strong ties to the Albania Institute of Islamic Thought and Culture.\n\nThe Saadi Shirazi Cultural Foundation is directly financed through the Islamic Culture and Relations Organizations. The foundation provides support for Iranian-related activities and organizations in Albania. Such support has included providing Iranian personalities for speaking tours in Tirana, including former Members of Iranian Parliament. The Saadi Shirazi Cultural Foundation targets middle and upper class Albanians.\n\nThe Islamic Culture and Relations Organization hosts art exhibitions displaying Iranian and Persian culture and history. In 2011, the Iranian Embassy in Jakarta provided an exhibition showcasing Persian calligrapher Mojtaba Sabzeh. The exhibition displayed Persian calligraphy samples while also offering discussion, seminars, and workshops related to Iranian art. The Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting's Press TV provided the reporting of the 2011 Jakarta event.\n\nThe Islamic Culture and Relations Organization and Iranian Embassy in Algiers hosted the Capital of Islamic Culture 2011 program in Tlemcen, Algeria. The event mixed Algerian and Iranian cartoons, handicrafts, paintings, and sculpture. The program further linked Algeria and Iran's shared Islamic history.\nMusic diplomacy is one aspect of cultural diplomacy that seeks to engage foreign publics through musical performances. The Tehran Symphony Orchestra is often sponsored by the Iranian government in musical exchanges throughout the world. In its efforts to approach European audiences, Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs provided free tickets to invited dignitaries and guests. Describing the 2010 European tour, the New York Times referenced overt propaganda through performances of the \"Peace and Friendship Symphony\", a piece written to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the Islamic Revolution. Much of the tour was met with criticism by demonstrations and protests. Michael Kimmelman of the New York Times declared the performance a tragedy, failing to meet the efforts of proper cultural exchange and public diplomacy.\n\nSports diplomacy refers to the use of sport and sport activity as a means to influence diplomatic, social, and political relations of a foreign public. Sporting exchanges provide a platform for increased dialogue among the people of foreign states, and to promote cultural understanding.\nHaving placed in the 49th World Team Table Tennis Championship in the People's Republic of China, Iran's Table Tennis team accepted an offer to hold joint training with the United States. The Iranian team trained in Las Vegas, beating the U.S. team 3-1. The Iranian team went on to play in the Las Vegas Open Table Tennis Tournament that year.\n\nWrestling is the national sport of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and the Iranian athletics associations often invites foreign teams to compete in the Takhti Cup. Iran admitted the United States to the 1998 Takhti Cup in a cultural exchange. The 1998 Takhti Cup welcomed the first American sports team to Iran since the Islamic Revolution. Iran views the opportunity to show its rich heritage and history in the sport of wrestling.\n\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting is the state-run broadcast communications organization. The IRIB contributes to the Islamic Republic's cultural diplomacy by providing Iranian focused radio, satellite-television, and web based broadcasts presented in a number of languages.\n\nAl Alam is the IRIB's 24-hour Arabic satellite channel, targeting over 300 million Arabic speakers worldwide. Launched in early 2003, the network initially served as a platform of opposition to both the Iraq led Ba'ath Party and the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. The BBC early reported that Al Alam shared programming similarities to Qatar-based Al Jazeera, only with an Iranian message. Such reporting has allowed Al Alam to promote a pan-Muslim image in order to downplay the Shia-Sunni sectarian conflict during the height of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n\nHispanTV is the IRIB's newest satellite network venture, targeting Spanish speaking populations of the Americas. First offering its news and analysis via the internet, HispanTV is scheduled to expand its satellite broadcasts in early 2012. Hispan TV is intending to counter what Ali Mohaqqeq, General-Secretary of the Iranian Embassy in Brazil, says is a western \"monopoly of news about Iran and the Middle East in Latin America.\"\n\nThe primary goal of Hispan TV is to provide a complete platform of multimedia service to the Spanish speaking peoples of Latin America, offering an opportunity for cultural exchange through television and web broadcasts.\n\nFurther goals include:\n\nLike Al Alam, iFilm is an Arabic speaking satellite network that targets much of Southwest Asia. The iFilm network presents Iranian films and serials to the Arab world in an attempt to present a near-real likeness of Iranian culture and society. Programs include: art and culture, documentaries, movies, short films and television series. Such television shows seek to build mutual friendship and understanding between Iranian and foreign (Arabic-speaking) publics. Broadcasts are aired in three 8-hour blocks, allowing all Middle Eastern communities the opportunity to view their favorite films and serials. As a network financed by the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting, iFilm depicts television entertainment in accordance to the mandates of the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance.\n\nAl Kawthar TV is IRIB's Arabic-speaking religious network. Promoting Shi'a Islam, Al Kawthar provides religious programming targeting the Middle East and North Africa. Programming includes Islamic cultural, intellectual, and social documentaries. The network seeks to promote unity among Muslims, strengthening Iran's position within the Islamic community. Al Kawthar TV provides roughly nineteen hours of broadcasts per day.\n\nPress TV is a 24-hour English language satellite network targeting Europe and North America. Headquartered in Tehran, Press TV provides documentaries, news analysis, and sports briefs. The mission of Press TV is definitive of public diplomacy in its goal \"to heed the voices and perspectives of the people of the world; build bridges of cultural understanding; encourage human beings of different nationalities, races and creeds to identity with one another; bring to light untold and overlooked stories of individuals who have experienced political and cultural divides firsthand.\"\n\nPress TV has been accused of being a mouthpiece of propaganda for the Iranian regime.\n"}

They are one of the few agencies to address the need for regular arts and therapeutic music interaction between professional artists, artisans and performers and the isolated elderly.\n\nRenaissance Enterprises was founded in 1988 by Bob Rowe to reach out to elderly members of the community. The organization operates in Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Tennessee and New York as well as some neighboring states.\n\nThe mission of Renaissance Enterprises is to provide therapeutic entertainment at nursing homes and related facilities through the use of artists, artisans and performers.\n\nThe aim is to deliver messages of love, healing and hope by means of the live arts to residents of long term care facilities. They note that abundant medical literature exists supporting the benefits of music to elderly and people with significant impairments such as physical pain or mental disorder. Music therapy is an accepted medical approach.\n\nRenaissance produced a booklet for artists to guide them in performances for these special audiences. Therein they also note that often they experience small wonders where an audience member had been silent for months or years but the music awakened something in them and prompted them to speech. \n\nRenaissance uses a staff of 25 volunteer artists for this purpose and typically delivers over 100 performances per year to audiences that are confined.\n\nIn 2006 the executive director was presented with the Mother Teresa Award for this work.\n\nIn 1994, Mother Teresa wrote: \"Your work of love in nursing homes, hospitals and for the aged, the neglected and the forgotten is truly the work of peace, for the fruit of love is service and the fruit of service is peace.

Stake. This approach enables to evaluate the educational and other programs by comparing the program activity, the program uniqueness, and the social diversity of the people.\n\nThe most important feature in the Responsive evaluation is the responsiveness to main issues and problems, in particular those cases where people recognize at the site.\n\nThe Responsive evaluation emphasizes:\n\nIn order to achieve a well responsive evaluation, it is essential to preordinate the evaluation.\n\nThis approach designs a \"front-loaded\" with the evaluation tools consumed to accomplish the observations by interpreting them. The Preordinate Evaluation has a relative contrast with the Responsive Evaluation\n\nThe Preordinate Evaluation design highlights:\n\nThe fundamental project of the Responsive predispositition is Stake’s 12 Prominent Events:\n\na) Identify program scope\n\nb) Overview program activities\n\nc) Discover purposes and concerns\n\nd) Conceptualize issues and problems\n\ne) Identify data needs\n\nf) Select observers, judges, and instruments (if any)\n\ng) Observe designated antecedents, transactions, and outcomes\n\nh) Thematize and prepare portrayals and case studies\n\ni) Winnow, match issues to audiences\n\nj) Format for audience use;\n\nk) Assemble formal reports (if any)\n\nl) Talk with clients, program staff, and audiences (Stake, 1976)\n\nThe responsive approach is applicable to summative and formative evaluations\n\nThe formative evaluation is useful when the project staff needs help monitoring the program and when no one knows what problems are going to face it.\n\nIn summative evaluation is useful this approach when audiences want to understand the activities, the strengths and the shortcoming of the project\n\nThe Responsive Evaluation is preferred over the Pre-ordinate evaluation when someone wants to know the extent to which set objectives have changed (Stake, 1972). The responsive approach let to generate large bases of data, to allow for a thick description of a program. In conclusion, the Responsive Evaluation allows for evaluations of programs which are either limited or broad in scope and is especially suited for programs which are in transition \n\nGender-Responsive evaluation is important as a means for building strong systems for generating and using evidence in order to improve the work that people do to achieve gender equality and women’s empowerment. Gender-responsive evaluation is a powerful resource for accomplish the transformative agenda of the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nGender-responsive approach can improve gender equality and the empowerment of women by incorporating gender and women’s rights aspects into evaluation approaches, methods, processes and use. Therefore, the evaluation is a link of positive change towards gender equality and the empowerment of women, but moreover the process itself also empowers the involved stakeholders and in this way, it prevents further gender discrimination and exclusion\n\nEffective gender-responsive programs and interventions enhance to eliminate social factors such as racism, sexism, and economic oppression which cannot be overlooked in discussions of effective interventions for women offenders. In termes of dealing with individual issues is important to take in consideration the social issues of poverty, race and gender inequalities because they have a profound impact on women lives. Successful interventions must relate to the social realities where women come from and to which they will return. Gender-Responsive Evaluation is sensitive to cultural differences and expectations. The very first challenge is to use theories and research development that support the implementation of these critical programs.\n"}

Their purpose is to prepare adolescents for their life as adults. Secular coming of age ceremonies originated in the 19th century, when non-religious people wanted a rite of passage comparable to the Christian Confirmation. Nowadays non-religious coming-of-age ceremonies are organized in several European countries.\n\nModern non-religious coming-of-age ceremonies originate in Germany, where \"Jugendweihe\" (\"youth consecration\", today occasionally known as \"Jugendfeier\", \"youth ceremony\") began in the 19th century. The activity was arranged by independent freethinker organizations until 1954, when the Communist party of East Germany banned it in its old form and changed it to promote Communist ideology. In the GDR Jugendweihe became, with the support of the state, the most popular form of coming-of-age ceremonies for the adolescents, replacing the Christian Confirmation. After the reunification of Germany the Jugendweihe-activity regained its independence from Communism, but the non-religious rite of passage had become a tradition, and thus approximately 60-70% of youngsters in the eastern states still participate in it. The age for participating in the Jugendweihe is 13–14 years.\n\nBefore the ceremony the youngsters attend specially arranged events or a course, in which they work on topics like history and multiculturalism, culture and creativity, civil rights and duties, nature and technology, professions and getting a job, as well as lifestyles and human relations. Nowadays there are many different groups organising Jugendweihes, but the most important ones are \"Jugendweihe Deutschland e. V.\", \"der Humanistische Verband Deutschland\" (\"the Humanist Association of Germany\"), \"der Freidenkerverband\" (\"the Freethinker Association\") and \"die Arbeiterwohlfahrt\" (\"the Worker Welfare\").\n\n\"Human-Etisk Forbund\" (\"The Norwegian Humanist Association\") has arranged non-religious confirmation courses in Norway since 1951. During the last ten years there has been rapid growth in the popularity of the course. In 2006 over 10500 youngsters, approximately 17% of the age group, chose the \"humanistisk konfirmasjon\" or \"borgerlig konfirmasjon\" (\"civil confirmation\"). The course can be taken in the year of one's 15th birthday. Norwegians living abroad can take the course as correspondence course by e-mail.\n\nHumanistforbundet, not to be confused with HEF (Human-Etisk Forbund) has since 2006 arranged an alternative to HEF's confirmation. It is a non-religious civil confirmation based on academics. The program usually consists of several lectures by various prestigious, well-known and competent organisations like the Red Cross, UNICEF and Dyrevernalliansen (a Norwegian animal welfare interest-organisation), people like Thomas Hylland Eriksen have also held lectures.\n\nIn Finland non-religious lower high school students planned a camp for a secular rite of passage as an alternative to the Christian Confirmation, and the first \"Prometheus-leiri\" (\"Prometheus Camp\") was held in 1989 by the Finnish Philosophy and Life Stance teachers' coalition. The following year \"Prometheus-leirin tuki ry\" (\"Prometheus Camp Association\") was founded for organising the week-long summer camps. The ideology of the association is based on a Humanist world view, but it is politically and religiously non-aligned. One of the main principles of the activity is tolerance towards other peoples' life stances.\nThe camp is primarily aimed at youngsters who do not belong to any religious denomination, but approximately 20% of yearly Prometheus Camp participants are members of some religious community, usually the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, and also participate in a Christian Confirmation. The usual age of participants in a Prometheus Camp is 14–15 years, but there are also \"senior camps\" for older youngsters. In recent years the yearly number of participants has been around 900, which is approximately 1,5% of the age group.\n\nThe themes in the Prometheus Camp are: differences, prejudice and discrimination; drugs, alcohol and addiction; society and making a difference in it; the future; world views, ideologies and religions; personal relationships and sexuality; and the environment. These topics are worked on in open discussions, debating, group work, small drama plays or playing games. Every camp is organised and led by a team of seven members: two adults and five youngsters. At the end of the camp there is a Prometheus Ceremony, in which the participants perform a chronicle about their week for their friends and family. They also get a Prometheus-diploma, a silver coloured Prometheus-medallion and a crown of leaves that is bound by the camp leaders. Weekend-long continuation camps are arranged in the autumn. Annually one Prometheus-camp has been arranged in English, two in Swedish and approximately 65 in Finnish.\n\nIn Iceland \"borgaraleg ferming\" (\"civil confirmations\") are organised by \"Siðmennt\", a Humanist association, as an alternative to the Christian Confirmation for the 13-year-old. Before the civil confirmation the youngsters take a preparation course about ethics, personal relationships, human rights, equality, critical thinking, relations between the sexes, prevention of substance abuse, skepticism, protecting the environment, getting along with parents, being a teenager in a consumer society, and what it means to be an adult and take responsibility for one's views and behavior. The course consists of 12 weekly group meetings, each lasting 1,5 hours. Youngsters living outside Reykjavík can take the course as a concentrated version during two weekends. The teachers of the course are usually philosophers. In the end of the course there is a formal graduation ceremony in which the participants receive diplomas, and some of them perform music, poetry and speeches. There are also prominent members of Icelandic society giving speeches. An increasing number of youngsters have taken the course every year with 300 taking the course for the confirmation in 2014.\n\nThe association \"Humanisterna\" (\"The Humanists\") started secular coming-of-age courses in Sweden in the 1990s in the form of study circles, but they were soon replaced by a week-long camp where the subjects are dealt with through discussions, games, group works and other activities. During the last years there has been approximately 100 participants annually in the \"Humanistisk konfirmation\" (\"Humanist confirmation\") camps. The themes in the camp concern one's life stance, for example human rights, equality, racism, gender roles, love, sexuality and lifestyles, but the topics under discussion depend on the participating youngsters' own choices. In the end of the camp there is a festive ceremony in which the participants demonstrate to their families and relatives what they did during the week, through e.g. plays and songs. There are also speeches held by the organisators of the camp, the youngsters themselves, and invited speakers.\n\nThe first civil confirmation in the Nordic countries was arranged in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1915 by \"Foreningen mod Kirkelig Konfirmation\" (\"Association Against Church Confirmation\"). In 1924 the organisation changed its name to Forgeningen Borgelig Konfirmation (\"The Association for Civil Confirmation\").\n\nCivil confirmation declined in the 1970s as central organized ceremonies, but instead they became increasingly more common as private celebrations and the civil confirmations are still common today in atheist families. They are also known as 'nonfirmations', but are now rarely linked to any associations.\n\nDuring the communist era, young people were given identity cards at the age of 15 in a collective ceremony. At the age of nineteen boys were required to perform military service.\n\nEdifices of the Ethical movement in the United States perform secular coming of age ceremonies for 14-year-old members, in which, after spending a year performing community service activities and attending workshops regarding various topics concerning adulthood, the honoree and one's parent(s) speak before the congregation about their growth over the year. Similar ceremonies are performed by congregations of the Unitarian Universalist Association and Canadian Unitarian Council.\n\n"}

Some of the finest animal artists from the United States, Canada, Europe, Africa, Japan, and Australia are represented in the Society's membership.\" \n\nThe Society holds an annual exhibition, \"Art & the Animal\", which premieres at museum venues. A portion of the exhibition is shown on tour around the United States. Dr. David J. Wagner is the current Tour Director and Curator for the Society of Animal Artists. The Society celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2010 with their exhibition at the San Diego Natural History Museum in San Diego, CA. A complete history of the SAA's exhibition can be found on their website.\n\nThe Society of Animal Artists is recognized as a 501(c)3 charitable organization by the I.R.S. and all contributions to the Society are tax-deductible\"\n\nThe Society of Animal Artists is an organization of artists who produce the best animal art in the world. The mission of the Society of Animal Artists is to promote excellence in the portrayal of domesticated and wild animals in art. The upshot of this nexus of talent and mission, is that artworks created by members of the Society of Animal Artists have established new standards of excellence in fine art, and that the Annual Exhibition of the Society of Animal Artists and its traveling exhibition, Art and the Animal, have become the standard by which all others are measured. The Society of Animal Artists has an historical affinity with organizations that grew out of a movement to form associations and clubs dedicated to art in the 19th century. Like the National Academy of Design and other such organizations, the Society of Animal Artists is mandated by its bylaws to organize annual exhibitions to ensure new, strong and fresh artwork and afford its members with ample display opportunities. It is also worth noting that the Society of Animal Artists was founded in response to an exhibition entitled Animals in the Bronx Zoo, held at Burr Galleries in New York, because this established an historical affinity with the conservation movement, which various members have supported ever since, not only through the ecological message of their artwork but also through generous contributions and sales.\n\nIn the 1950s, individuals from the New York metropolitan area who liked to meet and paint at the Bronx Zoo together staged \"Animals in the Bronx Zoo\" at the Burr Gallery sponsored by the New York Zoological Society. Patricia Allen Bott and Guido Borghi were inspired to form the organization after an enthusiastic reception to this exhibition. The fledgling Society soon became a member of the renowned Salmagundi Club, and established an office in their building at 47 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY. Early Exhibitions were held in various galleries such as Sportsman’s Edge, Grand Central Art Galleries and the Alder Gallery (All in New York City). \nIn addition to Bott and Borghi, early members included: Elizabeth Rungius Felda [Sister of Carl Rungius], Paul Bransom, John Clymer, Gifford Cochran, Brenda Frey, Anna Hyatt Huntington, Gertude K. Lathrop, Robert Lougheed, Ugo Mochi, Clement Weisbecker and Walter Wilwerding.\n\nThe first SAA catalog, produced in 1978 for the exhibition at Sportsman’s Edge Gallery, consisted of 8 pages and was black and white. In 1979, the SAA had its first actual Annual Exhibition opening (again at Sportsman’s Edge), with formal programs and events. A 20 page black and white catalog was produced. In 1980, the \"Society of Animal Artists Exhibition/Convention\" was hosted by Game Conservation International at the Four Seasons Plaza Nacional Hotel, San Antonio, TX. A 28 page, black and white catalog was produced. The first four-color catalog (44 pages) was produced in 1990, for the 30th Annual Exhibition at St. Hubert’s Giralda, NJ.\n\nThe SAA has hosted annual exhibitions since 1960 with the exhibition first being named \"Art and the Animal\" in 1988. The first museum venue was the Academy of Sciences in Philadelphia in 1981. In 1988 the Society recruited David J. Wagner to create and manage tours of artworks selected from annual exhibitions and to secure hosts for its annual exhibitions. SAA exhibitions have been displayed throughout the United States, with approximately 70% of hosting venues having been art museums or general museums that have included art as an integral dimension of their core mission. Over the years, the SAA’s work has been on display at more than 100 different institutions across the United States—and once in Canada in 1995 at the Old Algonquin Museum, Algonquin Park, Ontario.\n\n\n"}

It also provides funding to Māori Television and sister channel Te Reo to produce local programming in-house and acquire local and overseas programmes that are likely to interest Māori audiences in particular.\n\nTVNZ 1, TVNZ 2, Three, Prime TV and Sky TV programming is eligible for Te Māngai Pāho funding. The agency has previously funded bilingual content, outdoor broadcasts of Māori events, sports coverage with Māori language commentaries, Māori language children's programming, daily news and current affairs and other programmes.\n\nFlagship daily Māori language news programme Te Karere began in 1983 and has been funded by Te Māngai Pāho since its inception in 1989. The programme covers news of national significance that relates to a specifically Māori audience. It is presented by Scotty Morrison and produced by Tini Molyneux and Tina Wickliffe, with senior reporter Hinerangi Goodman and substitute host Peata Melbourne. The programme broadcasts on TVNZ 1 at 3:55 pm, and is repeated with subtitles at 1 am and 5:35 am the following day, and is available online through live streaming and on-demand services.\n\nUntil the end of 2014, the TVNZ Māori and Pacific department operated primarily to produce programmes that have received Te Māngai Pāho funding. Long-running bi-lingual current affairs programme Marae was one such programme. Presenters Scottie Morrison and Miriama Kamo introduced debates and panel discussions about Māori politics and longer-form stories about the Māori world. For most of its existence, the programme has been broadcast alongside English-subtitled Māori language documentary series Waka Huia, which was distributed around the world as an archival record of the Māori way of life.\n\nMāori Television began broadcasting around New Zealand 28 March 2004 from a base in Newmarket, and makes a significant contribution to the revitalisation of the Māori language and culture through its programming. Its mission under legislation is to revitalise Maori language and culture through providing high-quality, cost-effective Māori television, in both Māori and English languages, in a way that informs, educates, and entertains a broad viewing audience and therefore enriches New Zealand's society, culture, and heritage.\n\nThe flagship Māori Television attracts 1.5 million viewers each month, half of all Māori aged five or more, and one third of all New Zealanders. Current affairs show Native Affairs, sports coverage and international films and documentaries are among the highest-rating programmes on the channel.\n\nTe Reo is the company's second channel, launched 28 March 2008. Its contents is entirely in the Māori language with no advertising or subtitles, with many programmes being iwi-specific or geared towards fluent Māori language speakers. It also rebroadcasts or simulcasts many of Māori Television's Māori language programming, including daily news programme Te Kaea.\n\nTe Māngai Pāho funds the operation of a network of bilingual English and Māori language radio stations targeting members of local iwi and the wider public through local frequencies and online streaming. It operates as Te Whakaruruhau o Ngā Reo Irirangi Māori, the Iwi Radio Network, currently chaired by former Alliance MP Willie Jackson.\n\nProgramming on these stations includes national and local news coverage, music, educational programming, comedy, drama and programmes that teach the Māori language. These stations update listeners on iwi news and events, and promote Māori language and culture. Each station includes local shows, personalities and breakfast programmes.\n\nTahu FM, based in Christchurch, is also available on Sky digital 423.\n"}

The book received the Tchicaya U Tam'si Prize for African Poetry in 2014.\n\nThe main theme of \"Think of Lampedusa\" refers to the 2013 shipwreck of some 500 illegal African migrants near the Italian island of Lampedusa, that killed 366 persons. The book deals, on this basis, with the massive emigration of African youth to Europe. It describes the reasons for emigration, the conditions under which journeys are made and the often dramatic consequences of these adventures.\nThe poet, using both mythological and historical elements, questions in this work complex realities about the nature of man and his identity.\n\n\"Think of Lampedusa\" is the story of hundreds of young people, of various religions, who leave from Libya, Somalia, Eritrea or Mali towards Europe and most of whom perish during the crossing. Those who escape the depths of the ocean and reach the island of Lampedusa, will face the electric fence of hate.\n\nIt is also, through time and space, a rewrite with a touch of irony, the Iliad as well as the Odyssey and in a general way, the myth of Ulysses.\n\n\"Think of Lampedusa\" is a collection of poems that presents itself as a single text. The work appears as a verse for a story and therefore holds both poetry and narration. It uses in places, anaphora and allegories.\n\nThe author presents memories but also expectations through a hike that leads him through sea, dream, raft, anxiety and sinking.\n\n\n"}

Watch straps may be made of leather, plastic, rubber, cloth, or metal, sometimes in combination. It can be regarded as a fashion item, serving both a utilitarian and decorative function. Some metal watch straps may be plated with, or even in rare cases made of, precious metals.\n\nWatch straps may close with a buckle or a folding clasp. Expanding watch straps are designed to expand elastically, often by the use of metal springs in a segmented design, and may be slipped on like a bracelet. Attachment points for the strap to the watch are largely standardized, with a spring-loaded double-ended pin used to anchor the watch strap to holes in a bracket that is integral to the watch case, allowing worn watch straps to be replaced or swapped with new straps for fashion purposes.\n\nBoth metal watch cases, and watch straps incorporating metal parts can sometimes cause contact dermatitis in susceptible individuals. Special anti-allergy watch straps, like a NATO style watch strap, which shield the skin from exposure to metal parts, are available for sufferers of this type of dermatitis.\n\nSpecialist expanding watch straps exist for use with diving watches. With increasing depth and rising water pressure the (sleeved) wrist of a diver is exposed to compression effects that have a shrinking effect on the wrist circumference. Many watch straps intended for diving watches have rippled or vented sections near the attachment points on the watch case to facilitate the required flexibility to strap the watch exaggeratedly tight for normal wear at the surface whilst keeping the watch adequately tight in place on the diver's wrist at depth.\n\n"}

His father, uncomfortable with William's request, tries giving William toys the father considers more gender-appropriate, such as a basketball and a train set; while William enjoys these toys, he continues to ask for a doll. Eventually, the boy's grandmother fulfills the request, explaining to the father that William will use the doll to practice being a good father.\n\nZolotow has explained that although she is a feminist and appreciates that many feminists enjoyed the book's message, her inspiration was more from personal observations about her husband's early attempts to bond with the couple's son, Stephen, and about how men of the time period missed out on some of the pleasures of being closely involved with their children's development. She observed, for example, that by always exiting the room during diaper changes, her husband missed their son's first smile.\n\nThe book often is used in the United States for lessons on gender roles, stereotypes, or general anti-bias education. For example, the journal article \"'William's Doll' Revisited\" was on a study comparing reactions of fourth-grade students in 1975 and in 2000.\n\nA song based on the story, with music by Mary Rodgers and lyrics by Sheldon Harnick, was included in the best-selling \"Free to Be... You and Me\" children's album and songbook in 1972, where it was sung by Alan Alda and Marlo Thomas. (This same song was sung by B. D. Wong at the Ms. Foundation's 15th Annual Gloria Awards ceremony in 2003, where Marlo Thomas and former Ms. Foundation president Letty Cottin Pogrebin received the Creative Philanthropy Award for the album's creation.)\n\nWhen \"Free to Be... You and Me\" became a television special in 1974, ABC asked producer Marlo Thomas to make two changes to the material, one of which involved the Zolotow story:\n\"William's Doll\" also became a 14-minute film in 1981. The 1981 film starred Craig Salles as William and was shot in Graceada Park in Modesto, California. In 2010, the producers of RiffTrax, formerly Mystery Science Theater 3000, released \"William's Doll\". This was their \"riff\" of the aforementioned short.\n"}
