{"id": "713625", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=713625", "title": "A Storm of Swords", "text": "A Storm of Swords\n\nA Storm of Swords is the third of seven planned novels in \"A Song of Ice and Fire\", a fantasy series by American author George R. R. Martin. It was first published on August 8, 2000, in the United Kingdom, with a United States edition following in November 2000. Its publication was preceded by a novella called \"Path of the Dragon\", which collects some of the Daenerys Targaryen chapters from the novel into a single book.\n\nAt the time of its publication, \"A Storm of Swords\" was the longest novel in the series. It was so long that in the UK, Australia, and Israel, its paperback edition was split in half, Part 1 being published as \"Steel and Snow\" in June 2001 (with the one-volume cover) and Part 2 as \"Blood and Gold\" in August 2001 (with a specially-commissioned new cover). The same division was used in the Polish and Greek editions. In France, the decision was made to cut the novel into four separate volumes.\n\n\"A Storm of Swords\" won the 2001 Locus Award, the 2002 Geffen Award for Best Novel and was nominated for the 2001 Nebula Award for Best Novel. It was the first novel in the series to be nominated for the Hugo Award, one of the two most prestigious awards in science fiction and fantasy publishing, although it lost to J. K. Rowling's novel \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\".\n\nMeisha Merlin Publishing, which had previously issued limited, illustrated editions of both \"A Game of Thrones\" and \"A Clash of Kings\", was planning to release a similar version for \"A Storm of Swords\" in two volumes; however, lengthy delays in the release of \"A Clash of Kings\" caused it to lose its publishing rights, which were picked up by Subterranean Press. This edition, illustrated by Charles Vess, was released in the summer of 2006.\n\n\"A Storm of Swords\" is also the name of the second expansion to the board game \"A Game of Thrones\", released in July 2006. Approximately the first half of the novel was adapted for television as the third season of the HBO show \"Game of Thrones\", while the second half became the basis for the series' fourth season, and some elements for the series' fifth season.\n\n\"A Storm of Swords\" picks up the story slightly before the end of its predecessor, \"A Clash of Kings\". The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros are still in the grip of the War of the Five Kings, wherein Joffrey Baratheon and Stannis Baratheon compete for the Iron Throne while Robb Stark and Balon Greyjoy declare their independence. Meanwhile, a large host of wildlings approach the Wall under the leadership of Mance Rayder, the self-proclaimed \"King Beyond the Wall\", with only the undermanned Night's Watch in opposition. Finally, Daenerys Targaryen approaches Pentos.\n\nAt Riverrun, Catelyn Stark offers the captive Jaime Lannister his freedom in exchange for Catelyn's daughters, Sansa and Arya, who Catelyn believes are held by the Lannisters in King's Landing. Jaime is sent south, escorted by Brienne of Tarth. Catelyn makes this deal without the approval of her son Robb, the King in the North, and is taken prisoner upon its discovery. Robb's army returns to Riverrun, having vanquished Tywin Lannister's armies in the Westerlands, and Robb reveals that he has married Jeyne Westerling, invalidating his promise to be wed to a daughter of House Frey. Jaime's release infuriates Lord Rickard Karstark, whose two sons Eddard and Torrhen had been killed by Jaime in battle; and in revenge, Karstark kills two young Lannister captives. To secure his authority and atone for these deaths (thus preventing the Lannisters from executing Stark prisoners), Robb executes Lord Rickard, losing the support of House Karstark as a result.\n\nJaime and Brienne are waylaid by the Brave Companions (now in the service of Roose Bolton) and taken to Harrenhal. Their captain Vargo Hoat orders Jaime's sword hand cut off, hoping the blame will be placed on Bolton, but Jaime is sent to King's Landing after he assures Lord Bolton he will absolve him to his father. Brienne is thrown into a bear pit by Hoat, and Jaime risks his own life to rescue her. He also tells her that he had killed the former King Aerys II Targaryen because he planned to burn the city and its inhabitants with wildfire to spite Robert Baratheon.\n\nRobb's forces dwindle further at the Battle of Duskendale, wherein the eastern half of the Stark's armies, under the command of Roose Bolton, are ambushed by a joint army under Gregor Clegane and Lord Randyll Tarly. More losses are taken as the army retreats. Meanwhile, the Greyjoys now hold the Neck, having taken Moat Cailin, thus barring Robb from returning to his homeland. To recapture Moat Cailin from the Greyjoys, Robb relies on the support of the Freys. When Lord Hoster Tully dies, Catelyn's brother Edmure becomes Lord of Riverrun and Lord Paramount of the Trident. Robb gains renewed hope when he learns that Balon Greyjoy has died in a fall from a bridge, whereafter two of Balon's brothers, as well as his daughter Asha, vie to succeed him. The Freys propose a wedding between Edmure and Roslin Frey, one of Lord Walder Frey's daughters, to compensate for the loss of Robb's marriage.\n\nArya Stark and her friends encounter the \"Brotherhood Without Banners\", led by Lord Beric Dondarrion and the red priest Thoros of Myr: originally sent by Eddard Stark to put down the Lannister raids, the band now defends the smallfolk of the Riverlands. The group encounters Sandor Clegane, known as the Hound, who abandoned Joffrey during the Battle of the Blackwater, and offers him trial by battle, which he wins by killing Beric, but Thoros resurrects Beric thereafter. Arya is kidnapped by the Hound for ransom, and they proceed to Riverrun. On their journey, they discover that Robb and Catelyn will be at Edmure's wedding at the Frey bridge-stronghold The Twins, and change their destination accordingly.\n\nRobb Stark's army reaches the Twins, where Walder agrees to forgive Robb if the wedding between Edmure and Roslin takes place. At the wedding celebration, the Boltons and Freys turn on the Stark soldiers, massacring the Stark forces. Robb is murdered by Roose Bolton, while Catelyn has her throat cut by Raymund Frey and her body is thrown into the adjacent river. Many of the northern lords are killed, and the survivors captured. Edmure, after consummating his marriage, is kept as a hostage. These events become known as the Red Wedding.\n\nIt is thereafter revealed that Roose Bolton engineered the defeat at Duskendale by sending Robb's soldiers into a trap set by the Lannisters, while holding his own forces in reserve, and arranging that all but his own forces would be slaughtered in rearguard. The combined effect was to kill off the forces of other Northern houses loyal to Robb while leaving the Bolton army unscathed. Tywin Lannister (the King's Hand and grandfather) rewards Roose by naming House Bolton the Great House of the North, in place of House Stark. The crown also legitimizes Roose's bastard son Ramsay Snow as a Bolton and the new Lord of Winterfell.\n\nArya and the Hound arrive at the outskirts of the castle as the Red Wedding is taking place; to keep her from running inside to her death, the Hound knocks Arya unconscious and takes her downriver. As she sleeps, Arya sees through the eyes of her long-missing direwolf, Nymeria, that her mother Catelyn is dead, the direwolf pulling Catelyn's body from the river. Arya and the Hound encounter Gregor Clegane's men, by whom the Hound is wounded. His wound becomes infected, and Arya abandons him. She finds a ship from the Free City of Braavos and asks for passage to Eastwatch, but the captain refuses her passage until she offers him the coin and password \"Valar Morghulis\", given to her by Jaqen H'ghar. The captain replies \"Valar Dohaeris\", and they set sail.\n\nIn the epilogue, a re-animated but decayed and mutilated Catelyn is leading the Brotherhood Without Banners, and she oversees the lynching of two Freys present at the Red Wedding.\n\nAfter the Battle of the Blackwater, Davos Seaworth is taken to Dragonstone by men loyal to King Stannis. Stannis survived the Blackwater due to Rolland Storm commanding his rearguard and enabling him to escape to the fleet. Davos blames the red priestess Melisandre for Stannis's defeat and the deaths of his four eldest sons, and is imprisoned for treason (Melisandre having foreseen his intention to assassinate her). At Melisandre's behest, Stannis releases Davos and asks him to serve as his Hand. Stannis' previous Hand, his wife's uncle Lord Alester Florent, tried to make terms with the Lannisters behind Stannis' back, and has thus been arrested. With Stannis' cooperation, Melisandre has performed rituals to awaken \"stone dragons\", which she identifies as the great statues adjacent to the castle.\n\nKing's Landing welcomes the Tyrells as liberators, and King Joffrey sets aside his betrothal to Sansa Stark in favor of Margaery Tyrell. Sansa is soon compelled to marry Tyrion Lannister to enable Lannister control of the North and to foil a Tyrell plot to marry her to Willas Tyrell and claim the North themselves. However Tyrion refuses to consummate the marriage against her will.\n\nWord reaches King's Landing of the sudden death of Balon Greyjoy, followed by news of the Red Wedding. Joffrey gloats that he has \"won\" the war; whereas the governing Small Council is shocked to learn that Tywin secretly masterminded the Red Wedding. Tyrion warns his father that the defeated Northerners will not quietly submit to Bolton rule, but Tywin dismisses his warning. Later, Tyrion realizes that Joffrey sent the assassin who attempted to kill Bran Stark at Winterfell, and thus set the war in motion.\n\nMargaery and Joffrey's wedding is held as planned, but during the ensuing festivities, King Joffrey is poisoned and dies. Tyrion is accused of the murder by his sister Cersei Lannister and placed on trial. Sansa is smuggled out of the castle by the jester Dontos Hollard, and taken to Lord Petyr \"Littlefinger\" Baelish, who has Dontos killed and admits culpability in Joffrey's death and Tyrion's framing, incriminating Margaery's grandmother Olenna Tyrell as well. Littlefinger and Sansa depart King's Landing for the Eyrie, Littlefinger scheming to marry Catelyn's sister Lysa Arryn with the blessing of the Small Council to gain the support of House Arryn.\n\nDavos discovers a request by the Night's Watch for aid against Mance Rayder and the Others. Melisandre tries to persuade Stannis to sacrifice Edric Storm, a bastard son of Stannis' late brother King Robert Baratheon, to wake the dragons. Stannis is reluctant, though he uses Edric's blood in leeches to curse the three rival Kings. After Balon, Robb and Joffrey die, apparently proving the power of King's blood, Davos has Edric smuggled to safety. Stannis prepares to execute Davos for treason but is prevented when Davos shows Stannis the Night's Watch's plea.\n\nJaime and Brienne reach King's Landing to find that Joffrey's younger brother Tommen Baratheon will inherit the throne; Tyrion is on trial; and the Tyrell bannermen blame Brienne for Renly Baratheon's death. Jaime's severed right hand becomes infected, but he is healed by former maester Qyburn, who was thrown out of the Citadel for forbidden experiments, earning Qyburn the admiration of Cersei. Jaime refuses to believe that Tyrion killed Joffrey, rejects Cersei's advances, and becomes Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, but refuses his father's offer of Casterly Rock, whereupon Tywin disinherits him. Jaime frees Brienne and gives her a sword reforged from Ice, Ned Stark's sword. He tells her to keep her oath to Catelyn, to find Arya and Sansa and return them home. Against Tyrion, Cersei recruits the spymaster Varys and Tyrion's lover, Shae. Tyrion is approached by Prince Oberyn Martell of Dorne, who offers a trial by combat against Cersei's champion, Gregor Clegane, who he knows was responsible for the death of his sister Elia. Oberyn nearly emerges victorious, but is ultimately killed by Gregor, although the poison on Oberyn's spear leaves Gregor dying in agony. Tyrion is again condemned to death but is freed by Jaime and Varys. Jaime reveals that Tyrion's first wife Tysha, who Tywin had gang-raped by his garrison and forced Tyrion to participate, was not a prostitute as Tywin told him, and genuinely loved Tyrion. Outraged, Tyrion swears revenge on Jaime, Cersei, and Tywin, and tells Jaime he murdered Joffrey and that Cersei took other lovers while he was Robb Stark's captive. During Tyrion's escape, he strangles Shae and kills Tywin in his privy before fleeing Westeros.\n\nAt the Eyrie, Littlefinger and Lysa are married, and Sansa remains hidden by pretending to be an illegitimate daughter of Littlefinger's, named Alayne Stone. Lysa reveals that Littlefinger had convinced her to poison Jon Arryn, her late husband, to prevent her son from being fostered to Stannis Baratheon, and to write to Catelyn that Arryn had been poisoned by the Lannisters, which was the catalyst for the events of \"A Game of Thrones\". Lysa threatens to kill Sansa, thinking she is trying to seduce Littlefinger, but Littlefinger intervenes and, after revealing that he had only ever loved Catelyn, pushes Lysa to her death.\n\nThe detachment of the Night's Watch under Lord Commander Jeor Mormont awaits word from Qhorin Halfhand and Jon Snow at their forward base. The Watch are attacked by undead wights and the Others, suffering heavy casualties; but Samwell Tarly kills one of the Others with a blade of dragonglass. At Craster's Keep, some of the Watch mutiny and kill Mormont and Craster, but Sam escapes with the help of one of Craster's daughter-wives, Gilly, and they and the girl's newborn child approach the Wall, assisted by a strange figure riding an elk, whom Sam calls Coldhands. Among the dead are most of the Watch's senior leadership.\n\nBran Stark, his servant Hodor, Jojen and Meera Reed are guided north by Bran's dreams of a three-eyed crow. At the Wall, Sam guides them to Coldhands and returns to Castle Black, having sworn to keep Bran's survival secret even from Jon.\n\nJon convinces Mance that he is a deserter from the Night's Watch and learns that the Others are driving the wildlings south towards the Wall. Jon and his captor Ygritte also begin a sexual relationship. Mance seeks the legendary Horn of Winter to shatter the Wall. After climbing the Wall, the wildlings press Jon to murder a homeless man. When Jon refuses, the wildlings turn on him but Jon, with the assistance of Bran's direwolf Summer (Bran and company are hiding in a nearby abandoned tower), kills many of the wildlings and escapes to Castle Black. The approaching wildling army reaches Castle Black and assaults the Wall; but Jon takes command of the defenses and repels several assaults, during which Ygritte is slain. After that, Janos Slynt and Alliser Thorne imprison Jon for treachery and subsequently send him north of the Wall to kill Mance under a pretense of parley. As Jon is talking with Mance in the wildling camp, the army of King Stannis arrives, routing the Wildlings, and Mance is imprisoned. Melisandre believes the wildling invasion to portend the return of the Great Other, the sworn foe of her god R'hllor. Stannis offers to legitimize Jon and make him Lord of Winterfell in exchange for his support, but when his direwolf Ghost unexpectedly returns, Jon decides to decline Stannis' offer. Before he can inform Stannis, Jon is chosen by the Night's Watch as its new Lord Commander.\n\nHeading for Pentos by sea, Daenerys Targaryen learns that large slave armies can be bought in the cities of Slaver's Bay, and exchanges one of her infant dragons for the entire host of the warrior-eunuch Unsullied. Upon payment, which includes Drogon (the largest and strongest of her dragons), Daenerys orders the Unsullied to turn on their former masters and sack the city. With the help of her maturing dragons, she frees all the slaves of Astapor. Daenerys' horde then conquers the slaver city of Yunkai; but the lords of neighbouring Meereen antagonize Daenerys by killing child slaves and burning the land to deny her resources. Consequently, Daenerys besieges the city to no avail.\n\nDaenerys discovers two traitors in her camp: Ser Jorah Mormont, who had spied on her for Varys, informant to the late King Robert Baratheon, in exchange for a royal pardon; and Arstan Whitebeard, an alias of Ser Barristan Selmy, the humiliated former Lord Commander of Robert Baratheon's Kingsguard. Daenerys offers both men the chance to make amends by sneaking into Meereen to free the slaves and start an uprising. Meereen soon falls and, in retaliation for the murdered child slaves, Daenerys has the city's rulers put to death. Selmy asks for Daenerys' forgiveness and becomes Lord Commander of her Queensguard while Jorah, who refuses to admit any wrong, is banished. When Daenerys learns that the council she left in Astapor has been overthrown, she decides to rule Meereen to practice for the rule of Westeros.\n\nThe tale is told through the eyes of ten main characters, plus a one-off prologue POV and a one-off epilogue POV character, for a total of 12 narrators.\n\nOn October 6, 2009, Martin noted on his blog that his manuscript for \"A Storm of Swords\" had been 1521 pages in length; the initial printed hardcover came in at 992 pages. Martin did not write the Red Wedding chapters until he had completed every other chapter of the book, as he felt it was \"the hardest thing I ever wrote\" and that he would rather delay writing until absolutely necessary. In contrast, he referred to the chapter of Joffrey's fatal wedding as \"easy and fun to write\" but that he nevertheless tried to instill empathy for the painful demise of this very unpopular character and \"bring home the point that this, too, was a human being who was scared and terrified and then dead\".\n\nForeign language editions\n\n\"Publishers Weekly\" said the third volume was \"one of the more rewarding examples of gigantism in contemporary fantasy. [...] The complexity of characters such as Daenerys, Arya and the Kingslayer will keep readers turning even the vast number of pages contained in this volume, for the author, like Tolkien or Jordan, makes us care about their fates. Those two fantasy greats are also evoked by Martin's ability to convey such sensual experiences as the heat of wildfire, the chill of ice, the smell of the sea and the sheer gargantuan indigestibility of the medieval banquet at its most excessive. Perhaps this saga doesn't go as far beyond the previous bounds of high fantasy as some claim, but for most readers it certainly goes far enough to command their attention.\"\n\nMartin was nominated for the 2001 Hugo Award for Best Novel, but lost to J. K. Rowling for \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\". Afterwards he made this comment about his fans: \"Eat your heart out, Rowling. Maybe you have billions of dollars and my Hugo, but you don't have readers like \"these\".\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1143", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1143", "title": "Abbot", "text": "Abbot\n\nAbbot, meaning father, is an ecclesiastical title given to the male head of a monastery in various traditions, including Christianity. The office may also be given as an honorary title to a clergyman who is not the head of a monastery. The female equivalent is abbess.\n\nThe title had its origin in the monasteries of Egypt and Syria, spread through the eastern Mediterranean, and soon became accepted generally in all languages as the designation of the head of a monastery. The word is derived from the Aramaic \"av\" meaning \"father\" or \"abba\", meaning \"my father\". In the Septuagint, it was written as \"abbas\". At first it was employed as a respectful title for any monk, but it was soon restricted by canon law to certain priestly superiors. At times it was applied to various priests, e.g. at the court of the Frankish monarchy the \"Abbas palatinus\" (\"of the palace\"') and \"Abbas castrensis\" (\"of the camp\") were chaplains to the Merovingian and Carolingian sovereigns’ court and army respectively. The title abbot came into fairly general use in western monastic orders whose members include priests.\n\nAn abbot (from Old English \"abbod\", \"abbad\", from Latin \"abbas\" (“father”), from Ancient Greek \"ἀββᾶς\" (abbas), from Aramaic \"ܐܒܐ\"/\"אבא\" (’abbā, “father”); confer German \"Abt\"; French \"abbé\") is the head and chief governor of a community of monks, called also in the East \"hegumen\" or \"archimandrite\". The English version for a female monastic head is abbess.\n\nIn Egypt, the first home of monasticism, the jurisdiction of the abbot, or archimandrite, was but loosely defined. Sometimes he ruled over only one community, sometimes over several, each of which had its own abbot as well. Saint John Cassian speaks of an abbot of the Thebaid who had 500 monks under him. By the Rule of St Benedict, which, until the Cluniac reforms, was the norm in the West, the abbot has jurisdiction over only one community. The rule, as was inevitable, was subject to frequent violations; but it was not until the foundation of the Cluniac Order that the idea of a supreme abbot, exercising jurisdiction over all the houses of an order, was definitely recognised.\n\nMonks, as a rule, were laymen, nor at the outset was the abbot any exception. For the reception of the sacraments, and for other religious offices, the abbot and his monks were commanded to attend the nearest church. This rule proved inconvenient when a monastery was situated in a desert or at a distance from a city, and necessity compelled the ordination of some monks. This innovation was not introduced without a struggle, ecclesiastical dignity being regarded as inconsistent with the higher spiritual life, but, before the close of the 5th century, at least in the East, abbots seem almost universally to have become deacons, if not priests. The change spread more slowly in the West, where the office of abbot was commonly filled by laymen till the end of the 7th century. The ecclesiastical leadership exercised by abbots despite their frequent lay status is proved by their attendance and votes at ecclesiastical councils. Thus at the first Council of Constantinople, AD 448, 23 archimandrites or abbots sign, with 30 bishops.\n\nThe second Council of Nicaea, AD 787, recognized the right of abbots to ordain their monks to the inferior orders below the diaconate, a power usually reserved to bishops.\n\nAbbots used to be subject to episcopal jurisdiction, and continued generally so, in fact, in the West till the 11th century. The Code of Justinian (lib. i. tit. iii. de Ep. leg. xl.) expressly subordinates the abbot to episcopal oversight. The first case recorded of the partial exemption of an abbot from episcopal control is that of Faustus, abbot of Lerins, at the council of Arles, AD 456; but the exorbitant claims and exactions of bishops, to which this repugnance to episcopal control is to be traced, far more than to the arrogance of abbots, rendered it increasingly frequent, and, in the 6th century, the practice of exempting religious houses partly or altogether from episcopal control, and making them responsible to the pope alone, received an impulse from Pope Gregory the Great. These exceptions, introduced with a good object, had grown into a widespread evil by the 12th century, virtually creating an \"imperium in imperio,\" and depriving the bishop of all authority over the chief centres of influence in his diocese.\n\nIn the 12th century, the abbots of Fulda claimed precedence of the archbishop of Cologne. Abbots more and more assumed almost episcopal state, and in defiance of the prohibition of early councils and the protests of St Bernard and others, adopted the episcopal insignia of mitre, ring, gloves and sandals.\n\nIt has been maintained that the right to wear mitres was sometimes granted by the popes to abbots before the 11th century, but the documents on which this claim is based are not genuine (J. Braun, \"Liturgische Gewandung\", p. 453). The first undoubted instance is the bull by which Alexander II in 1063 granted the use of the mitre to Egelsinus, abbot of the monastery of St Augustine at Canterbury. The mitred abbots in England were those of Abingdon, St Alban's, Bardney, Battle, Bury St Edmunds, St Augustine's Canterbury, Colchester, Croyland, Evesham, Glastonbury, Gloucester, St Benet's Hulme, Hyde, Malmesbury, Peterborough, Ramsey, Reading, Selby, Shrewsbury, Tavistock, Thorney, Westminster, Winchcombe, and St Mary's York. Of these the precedence was yielded to the abbot of Glastonbury, until in AD 1154 Adrian IV (Nicholas Breakspear) granted it to the abbot of St Alban's, in which monastery he had been brought up. Next after the abbot of St Alban's ranked the abbot of Westminster and then Ramsey. Elsewhere, the mitred abbots that sat in the Estates of Scotland were of Arbroath, Cambuskenneth, Coupar Angus, Dunfermline, Holyrood, Iona, Kelso, Kilwinning, Kinloss, Lindores, Paisley, Melrose, Scone, St Andrews Priory and Sweetheart. To distinguish abbots from bishops, it was ordained that their mitre should be made of less costly materials, and should not be ornamented with gold, a rule which was soon entirely disregarded, and that the crook of their pastoral staff (the crosier) should turn inwards instead of outwards, indicating that their jurisdiction was limited to their own house.\n\nThe adoption of certain episcopal insignia (pontificalia) by abbots was followed by an encroachment on episcopal functions, which had to be specially but ineffectually guarded against by the Lateran council, AD 1123. In the East abbots, if in priests' orders and with the consent of the bishop, were, as we have seen, permitted by the second Nicene council, AD 787, to confer the tonsure and admit to the order of reader; but gradually abbots, in the West also, advanced higher claims, until we find them in AD 1489 permitted by Innocent IV to confer both the subdiaconate and diaconate. Of course, they always and everywhere had the power of admitting their own monks and vesting them with the religious habit.\n\nThe power of the abbot was paternal but absolute, limited, however, by the canon law. One of the main goals of monasticism was the purgation of self and selfishness, and obedience was seen as a path to that perfection. It was sacred duty to execute the abbot's orders, and even to act without his orders was sometimes considered a transgression. Examples among the Egyptian monks of this submission to the commands of the superiors, exalted into a virtue by those who regarded the entire crushing of the individual will as a goal, are detailed by Cassian and others, e.g. a monk watering a dry stick, day after day, for months, or endeavoring to remove a huge rock immensely exceeding his powers.\n\nWhen a vacancy occurred, the bishop of the diocese chose the abbot out of the monks of the convent, but the right of election was transferred by jurisdiction to the monks themselves, reserving to the bishop the confirmation of the election and the benediction of the new abbot. In abbeys exempt from the (arch)bishop's diocesan jurisdiction, the confirmation and benediction had to be conferred by the pope in person, the house being taxed with the expenses of the new abbot's journey to Rome. It was necessary that an abbot should be at least 30 years of age, of legitimate birth, a monk of the house for at least 10 years, unless it furnished no suitable candidate, when a liberty was allowed of electing from another convent, well instructed himself, and able to instruct others, one also who had learned how to command by having practised obedience. In some exceptional cases an abbot was allowed to name his own successor. Cassian speaks of an abbot in Egypt doing this; and in later times we have another example in the case of St Bruno. Popes and sovereigns gradually encroached on the rights of the monks, until in Italy the pope had usurped the nomination of all abbots, and the king in France, with the exception of Cluny, Premontré and other houses, chiefs of their order. The election was for life, unless the abbot was canonically deprived by the chiefs of his order, or when he was directly subject to them, by the pope or the bishop, and also in England it was for a term of 8–12 years.\n\nThe ceremony of the formal admission of a Benedictine abbot in medieval times is thus prescribed by the consuetudinary of Abingdon. The newly elected abbot was to put off his shoes at the door of the church, and proceed barefoot to meet the members of the house advancing in a procession. After proceeding up the nave, he was to kneel and pray at the topmost step of the entrance of the choir, into which he was to be introduced by the bishop or his commissary, and placed in his stall. The monks, then kneeling, gave him the kiss of peace on the hand, and rising, on the mouth, the abbot holding his staff of office. He then put on his shoes in the vestry, and a chapter was held, and the bishop or his delegate preached a suitable sermon.\n\nBefore the late modern era, the abbot was treated with the utmost reverence by the brethren of his house. When he appeared either in church or chapter all present rose and bowed. His letters were received kneeling, as were those of the pope and the king. No monk might sit in his presence, or leave it without his permission, reflecting the hierarchical etiquette of families and society. The highest place was assigned to him, both in church and at table. In the East he was commanded to eat with the other monks. In the West the Rule of St Benedict appointed him a separate table, at which he might entertain guests and strangers. Because this permission opened the door to luxurious living, Synods of Aachen (816–819), decreed that the abbot should dine in the refectory, and be content with the ordinary fare of the monks, unless he had to entertain a guest. These ordinances proved, however, generally ineffectual to secure strictness of diet, and contemporaneous literature abounds with satirical remarks and complaints concerning the inordinate extravagance of the tables of the abbots. When the abbot condescended to dine in the refectory, his chaplains waited upon him with the dishes, a servant, if necessary, assisting them. When abbots dined in their own private hall, the Rule of St Benedict charged them to invite their monks to their table, provided there was room, on which occasions the guests were to abstain from quarrels, slanderous talk and idle gossiping.\nThe ordinary attire of the abbot was according to rule to be the same as that of the monks. But by the 10th century the rule was commonly set aside, and we find frequent complaints of abbots dressing in silk, and adopting sumptuous attire. Some even laid aside the monastic habit altogether, and assumed a secular dress. With the increase of wealth and power, abbots had lost much of their special religious character, and become great lords, chiefly distinguished from lay lords by celibacy. Thus we hear of abbots going out to hunt, with their men carrying bows and arrows; keeping horses, dogs and huntsmen; and special mention is made of an abbot of Leicester, c. 1360, who was the most skilled of all the nobility in hare hunting. In magnificence of equipage and retinue the abbots vied with the first nobles of the realm. They rode on mules with gilded bridles, rich saddles and housings, carrying hawks on their wrist, followed by an immense train of attendants. The bells of the churches were rung as they passed. They associated on equal terms with laymen of the highest distinction, and shared all their pleasures and pursuits. This rank and power was, however, often used most beneficially. For instance, we read of Whiting, the last abbot of Glastonbury, judicially murdered by Henry VIII, that his house was a kind of well-ordered court, where as many as 300 sons of noblemen and gentlemen, who had been sent to him for virtuous education, had been brought up, besides others of a lesser rank, whom he fitted for the universities. His table, attendance and officers were an honour to the nation. He would entertain as many as 500 persons of rank at one time, besides relieving the poor of the vicinity twice a week. He had his country houses and fisheries, and when he travelled to attend parliament his retinue amounted to upwards of 100 persons. The abbots of Cluny and Vendôme were, by virtue of their office, cardinals of the Roman church.\n\nIn the process of time, the title abbot was extended to clerics who had no connection with the monastic system, as to the principal of a body of parochial clergy; and under the Carolingians to the chief chaplain of the king, ', or military chaplain of the emperor, ' It even came to be adopted by purely secular officials. Thus the chief magistrate of the republic at Genoa was called \"\".\n\nLay abbots (M. Lat. ', ', ', ', ' or ', ', or sometimes simply ') were the outcome of the growth of the feudal system from the 8th century onwards. The practice of commendation, by which—to meet a contemporary emergency—the revenues of the community were handed over to a lay lord, in return for his protection,\nearly suggested to the emperors and kings the expedient of rewarding their warriors with rich abbeys held \"in commendam.\"\n\nDuring the Carolingian epoch, the custom grew up of granting these as regular heritable fiefs or benefices, and by the 10th century, before the great Cluniac reform, the system was firmly established. Even the abbey of St Denis was held in commendam by Hugh Capet. The example of the kings was followed by the feudal nobles, sometimes by making a temporary concession permanent, sometimes without any form of commendation whatever. In England the abuse was rife in the 8th century, as may be gathered from the acts of the council of Cloveshoe. These lay abbacies were not merely a question of overlordship, but implied the concentration in lay hands of all the rights, immunities and jurisdiction of the foundations, i.e. the more or less complete secularization of spiritual institutions. The lay abbot took his recognized rank in the feudal hierarchy, and was free to dispose of his fief as in the case of any other. The enfeoffment of abbeys differed in form and degree. Sometimes the monks were directly subject to the lay abbot; sometimes he appointed a substitute to perform the spiritual functions, known usually as dean (decanus), but also as abbot (\"abbas legitimas\", \"monasticus\", \"regularis\").\n\nWhen the great reform of the 11th century had put an end to the direct jurisdiction of the lay abbots, the honorary title of abbot continued to be held by certain of the great feudal families, as late as the 13th century and later, with the head of the community retaining the title of dean. The connection of the lesser lay abbots with the abbeys, especially in the south of France, lasted longer; and certain feudal families retained the title of abbes chevaliers (abbates milltes) for centuries, together with certain rights over the abbey lands or revenues. The abuse was not confined to the West. John, patriarch of Antioch, at the beginning of the 12th Century, informs us that in his time most monasteries had been handed over to laymen, \"bencficiarii,\" for life, or for part of their lives, by the emperors.\n\nGiraldus Cambrensis reported (\"Itinerary\", ii.iv) the common customs of lay abbots in the late 12th-century Church of Wales:\nIn conventual cathedrals, where the bishop occupied the place of the abbot, the functions usually devolving on the superior of the monastery were performed by a prior.\n\nIn the Roman Catholic Church, abbots continue to be elected by the monks of an abbey to lead them as their religious superior in those orders and monasteries that make use of the term (some orders of monks, as the Carthusians for instance, have no abbots, only priors). A monastery must have been granted the status of an abbey by the pope, and such monasteries are normally raised to this level after showing a degree of stability—a certain number of monks in vows, a certain number of years of establishment, a certain firmness to the foundation in economic, vocational and legal aspects. Prior to this, the monastery would be a mere priory, headed by a prior who acts as superior but without the same degree of legal authority that an abbot has.\nThe abbot is chosen by the monks from among the fully professed monks. Once chosen, he must request blessing: the blessing of an abbot is celebrated by the bishop in whose diocese the monastery is or, with his permission, another abbot or bishop. The ceremony of such a blessing is similar in some aspects to the consecration of a bishop, with the new abbot being presented with the mitre, the ring, and the crosier as symbols of office and receiving the laying on of hands and blessing from the celebrant. Though the ceremony installs the new abbot into a position of legal authority, it does not confer further sacramental authority- it is not a further degree of Holy Orders (although some abbots have been ordained to the episcopacy).\n\nOnce he has received this blessing, the abbot not only becomes father of his monks in a spiritual sense, but their major superior under canon law, and has the additional authority to confer the ministries of acolyte and lector (formerly, he could confer the minor orders, which are not sacraments, that these ministries have replaced). The abbey is a species of \"exempt religious\" in that it is, for the most part, answerable to the pope, or to the abbot primate, rather than to the local bishop.\n\nThe abbot wears the same habit as his fellow monks, though by tradition he adds to it a pectoral cross.\n\nTerritorial abbots follow all of the above, but in addition must receive a mandate of authority from the pope over the territory around the monastery for which they are responsible.\n\nIn some monastic families, there is a hierarchy of precedence or authority among abbots. In some cases, this is the result of an abbey being considered the \"mother\" of several \"daughter\" abbeys founded as dependent priories of the \"mother.\" In other cases, abbeys have affiliated in networks known as \"congregations.\" Some monastic families recognize one abbey as the motherhouse of the entire order.\n\n\nThe title abbé (French; Ital. \"abate\"), as commonly used in the Catholic Church on the European continent, is the equivalent of the English \"Father\" (parallel etymology), being loosely applied to all who have received the tonsure. This use of the title is said to have originated in the right conceded to the king of France, by the concordat between Pope Leo X and Francis I (1516), to appoint \"abbés commendataires\" to most of the abbeys in France. The expectation of obtaining these sinecures drew young men towards the church in considerable numbers, and the class of abbés so formed—\"abbés de cour\" they were sometimes called, and sometimes (ironically) \"abbés de sainte espérance\", (abbés of holy hope; or the jeu de mots, of St. Hope)—came to hold a recognized position. The connection many of them had with the church was of the slenderest kind, consisting mainly in adopting the title of abbé, after a remarkably moderate course of theological study, practising celibacy and wearing a distinctive dress—a short dark-violet coat with narrow collar. Being men of presumed learning and undoubted leisure, many of the class found admission to the houses of the French nobility as tutors or advisers. Nearly every great family had its abbé. The class did not survive the Revolution; but the courtesy title of abbé, having long lost all connection in people's minds with any special ecclesiastical function, remained as a convenient general term applicable to any clergyman.\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches, the abbot is referred to as the \"hegumen\". The Superior of a convent of nuns is called the \"Hēguménē\". The title of \"archimandrite\" (literally the head of the enclosure) used to mean something similar.\n\nIn the East, the principle set forth in the \"Corpus Juris Civilis\" still applies, whereby most abbots are immediately subject to the local bishop. Those monasteries which enjoy the status of being \"stauropegiac\" will be subject only to a primate or his Synod of Bishops and not the local bishop.\n\nAlthough currently in the Western Church the title \"abbot\" is given only abbots of monasteries, the title archimandrite is given to \"monastics\" (i.e., celibate) priests in the East, even when not attached to a monastery, as an honor for service, similar to the title of monsignor in the Western/Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church. In the Orthodox Church, only monastics are permitted to be elevated to the rank of archimandrite. Married priests are elevated to the parallel rank of Archpriest or Protopresbyter. Normally there are no celibate priests who are not monastics in the Orthodox Church, with the exception of married priests who have been widowed. Since the time of Catherine II the ranks of Abbot and Archimandrite have been given as honorary titles in the Russian Church, and may be given to any monastic, even if he does not in fact serve as the superior of a monastery. In Greek practice the title or function of Abbot corresponds to a person who serves as the head of a monastery, although the title of the Archimandrite may be given to any celibate priest who could serve as the head of a monastery.\n\nIn the German Evangelical Church, the German title of \"Abt\" (abbot) is sometimes bestowed, like the French \"abbé\", as an honorary distinction, and survives to designate the heads of some monasteries converted at the Reformation into collegiate foundations.\nOf these the most noteworthy is Loccum Abbey in Hanover, founded as a Cistercian house in 1163 by Count Wilbrand of Hallermund, and reformed in 1593. The abbot of Loccum, who still carries a pastoral staff, takes precedence over all the clergy of Hanover, and was \"ex officio\" a member of the consistory of the kingdom. The governing body of the abbey consists of the abbot, prior and the \"convent\" of \"Stiftsherren\" (canons).\n\nIn the Church of England, the Bishop of Norwich, by royal decree given by Henry VIII, also holds the honorary title of \"Abbot of St. Benet.\" This title hails back to England's separation from the See of Rome, when King Henry, as supreme head of the newly independent church, took over all of the monasteries, mainly for their possessions, except for St. Benet, which he spared because the abbot and his monks possessed no wealth, and lived like simple beggars, deposing the incumbent Bishop of Norwich and seating the abbot in his place, thus the dual title still held to this day.\n\nAdditionally, at the enthronement of the Archbishop of Canterbury, there is a threefold enthronement, once in the throne the chancel as the diocesan bishop of Canterbury, once in the Chair of St. Augustine as the Primate of All England, and then once in the chapter-house as Titular Abbot of Canterbury.\n\nThere are several Benedictine abbeys throughout the Anglican Communion. Most of them have mitred abbots.\n\n\"The Abbot\" is one of the archetypes traditionally illustrated in scenes of \"Danse Macabre\".\n\nThe lives of numerous abbots make up a significant contribution to Christian hagiography, one of the most well-known being the \"Life of St. Benedict of Nursia\" by St. Gregory the Great.\n\nDuring the years 1106–1107 AD, Daniel, a Russian Orthodox abbot, made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land and recorded his experiences. His diary was much-read throughout Russia, and at least seventy-five manuscript copies survive. Saint Joseph, Abbot of Volokolamsk, Russia (1439–1515), wrote a number of influential works against heresy, and about monastic and liturgical discipline, and Christian philanthropy.\n\nIn the \"Tales of Redwall\" series, the creatures of Redwall are led by an abbot or abbess. These \"abbots\" are appointed by the brothers and sisters of Redwall to serve as a superior and provide paternal care, much like real abbots.\n\n\"The Abbot\" was a nickname of RZA from the Wu-Tang Clan.\n\n\n\n"}

Featuring six pieces of classical music, the film is a parody of Walt Disney's \"Fantasia\", two of its episodes being derived from the earlier film. The classical pieces are set to color animation, ranging from comedy to deep tragedy. \n\nAt the beginning, in between the animation, and at the end, there are black and white live-action sequences, displaying the fictional animator, orchestra, conductor and filmmaker, with many humorous scenes about the fictional production of the film. Some of these sections mix animation and live action.\n\nThe film was released in two versions. The first includes live action sequences in between the classical pieces; the second version of the film omits these, replacing them with animated plasticine letters spelling out the title of the next piece of music.\n\nIn music, an instruction of \"allegro ma non troppo\" means to play \"fast, but not overly so\". Without the \"ma\", it means \"Not So Fast!\", an interjection meaning \"slow down\" or \"think before you act\".\n\nThe common meaning of \"allegro\" in Italian is \"joyful\". The title reveals therefore a dual meaning of \"allegro\", and in addition to meaning \"Not So Fast!\" can also be read as \"joyful, but not too much\".\n\n\nThe uncut film also contains comic live action sequences, in black and white blended with occasional color animations, that parody the Deems Taylor introductions from \"Fantasia\". \"The Presenter\" (Maurizio Micheli) starts off with an exaggerated version of Taylor's opening introduction in \"Fantasia\" ( \"A new and original film\" .. \"you will see the music and hear the drawings\" .. \"a fantasia\") only to be interrupted by a phone call from California informing him that the movie had already been done. He angrily objects, dismissing the caller as an ill-mannered liar, explaining to the audience that the caller claims that someone (\"Prisney\", \"Grisney\", \"some American\") had done this years before, then telling the caller to at least watch the movie and hangs up. Next the Presenter introduces \"The Orchestra Master\" (Néstor Garay) and an orchestra made up of little old ladies as the Orchestra Master roughly rounds them up into a large trailer for transport to the theater. As the trailer heads out to the theater the Presenter exults \"Pisney has already done this?\". Lastly before the first animated music segment (\"Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune\"), the Presenter introduces \"The Animator\" (Maurizio Nichetti). as the Orchestra Master retrieves him from a dungeon-like cell in which the Animator (\"a free artist\") is chained to a wall (as the Presenter puts it: \"a binding contract based on trust and mutual respect\"). A pretty young cleaning woman (Marialuisa Giovannini) also appears in each segment, although she's barely acknowledged by any of the characters except the Animator (who seems to take an increasing fancy to her as the movie progresses). Each sequence portrays action (like the tossing of a Coca Cola bottle) that leads directly into the next animated portion of the film and occasionally includes references to a previous segment (such as a chamberpot appearing on the Orchestra Master's head or the female bee and the serpent from their respective segments appearing briefly in the subsequent live-action sequences). After the \"Ravel's Bolero\" chapter, a gorilla (inspired by the animated character in the Bolero) also appears a few times, first chasing then dancing with The Animator, then later beating up the Orchestra Master who has attacked the Animator. After the \"Firebird\" sequence, the Animator transforms the cleaning woman into a cartoon fairy tale princess and himself into a prince before both float away leaving the Presenter and Orchestra Master without a finale leading into the epilogue sequence. \n\n\n"}

The anthropology of art focuses on historical, economic and aesthetic dimensions in non-Western art forms, including what is known as 'tribal art'.\n\nFranz Boas, one of the pioneers of modern anthropology, conducted many field studies of the arts, helping create a foundation to the field. His book, \"Primitive Art\" (1927), summarizes his main insights into so-called 'primitive' art forms, with a detailed case study on the arts of the Northwest Pacific Coast. The famous anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss took Boas' analyses further in his book \"The Way of the Masks\", where he traced changes in the plastic form of Northwest Pacific masks to patterns of intercultural interaction among the indigenous peoples of the coast.\n\nOne of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the universality of 'art' as a cultural phenomenon. Several anthropologists have noted that the Western categories of 'painting', 'sculpture', or 'literature', conceived as independent artistic activities, do not exist, or exist in a significantly different form, in most non-Western contexts. Thus, there is no consensus on a single, cross-cultural definition of 'art' in anthropology. To surmount this difficulty, anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which, without exclusively being 'artistic', have certain evident 'aesthetic' qualities. Boas' \"Primitive Art\", Claude Lévi-Strauss' \"The Way of the Masks\" (1982) or Geertz's 'Art as Cultural System' (1983) are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of 'art' into an anthropology of culturally-specific 'aesthetics'. More recently, in his book \"Art and Agency\", Alfred Gell proposed a new definition of 'art' as a complex system of intentionality, where artists produce art objects to effect changes in the world, including (but not restricted to) changes in the aesthetic perceptions of art audiences. Gell's ideas have stirred a large controversy in the anthropology of art in the 2000s.\n\n\n\n"}

The society's purpose was to promote knowledge of the art works of the old Italian, Flemish, and other European masters. Much of the work of the society consisted of publishing chromolithographs of Italian art works, especially fresco paintings, of earlier centuries and raising public awareness for the preservation of these works.

{"id": "1725669", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1725669", "title": "Banaue Rice Terraces", "text": "Banaue Rice Terraces\n\nThe Banaue Rice Terraces () are terraces that were carved into the mountains of Ifugao in the Philippines by the ancestors of the indigenous people. The terraces are occasionally called the \"Eighth Wonder of the World\". It is commonly thought that the terraces were built with minimal equipment, largely by hand. The terraces are located approximately above sea level. These are fed by an ancient irrigation system from the rainforests above the terraces. It is said that if the steps were put end to end, it would \"encircle half of the globe\".\n\nLocals up to this day still plant rice and vegetables on the terraces, although more and more younger Ifugaos do not find farming appealing, often opting for the more lucrative hospitality industry generated by the terraces. The result is the gradual erosion of the characteristic \"steps\", which require constant reconstruction and care. In 2010, a further problem encountered was drought, with the terraces drying up completely in March of that year.\n\nThe age of the terraces are believed by many to be over a 2,000 years old as postulated by anthropologist Otley Beyer. Several researchers however dispute this and contend that the terraces were built much later. There are also giant Earthworms (\"Olang\" in Ifugao) of the genus Pheretima or Polypheretima elongata which are supposed to destroy the terraces, apart from rodents of the genus Chrotomis mindorensis, and snails. \n\nThe terraces are found in the province of Ifugao and the Ifugao people have been its caretakers. Ifugao culture revolves around rice, and the culture engenders an elaborate array of celebrations linked with agricultural rites from rice cultivation to rice consumption. The harvest season generally calls for thanksgiving feasts, while the concluding harvest rites called \"tango\" or \"tungul\" (a day of rest) entail a strict taboo on any agricultural work. Partaking of the \"bayah\" rice wine), rice cakes, and betel nut constitutes an indelible practice during the festivities.\n\nThe Ifugao people practice traditional farming spending most of their labour at their terraces and forest lands while occasionally tending to root crop cultivation. The Ifugaos have also been known to culture edible shells, fruit trees, and other vegetables which have been exhibited among Ifugaos for generations. The building of the rice terraces entails constructing retaining walls with stones and rammed earth which are designed to draw water from a main irrigation canal above the terrace clusters. Indigenous rice terracing technologies have been identified with the Ifugao’s rice terraces such as their knowledge of water irrigation, stonework, earthwork and terrace maintenance. As their source of life and art, the rice terraces have sustained and shaped the lives of the community members. Ifugao previously belong to the Mountain Province as a municipality but on June 18, 1966 in effect of Republic Act No. 4695, Ifugao became an independent province.\n\nIn March 2009 the Ifugao rice terraces were declared free from genetically modified organisms (GMO). An event declaring this achievement was organized in Dianara Viewpoint in collaboration with local and municipal government, Greenpeace, and the Miss Earth Foundation.\n\nThe Banaue Rice Terraces refer to the cluster close to the Banaue poblacion as seen from the viewpoint. Contrary to popular belief perpetrated by its inclusion on the twenty peso banknote, the Banaue Rice Terraces are not a UNESCO World Heritage Site. They were not included in the UNESCO inscription Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras due to the presence of numerous modern structures, making it score low in the integrity criterion of UNESCO.\n\nThe five clusters inscribed as part of the Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras are Batad, Bangaan, Hungduan, Mayoyao Central and Nagacadan. Batad and Bangaan are under the jurisdiction of the Municipality of Banaue but are not called the Banaue Rice Terraces.\n\nThe Banaue Rice Terraces were declared by the Philippine government as a National Cultural Treasure under Ifugao Rice Terraces by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 260 in 1973.\n\nAnother thriving economy in the Banaue Rice Terraces is tourism. The Tourism industry has developed a number of activities for visitors which may include the traditional sight seeing of the terraces and visits to the tribes at the foot of the terraces. A \"Mumbaki\" (traditional Ifugao witch doctor) is also recommended to visitors, these doctors can perform spiritual healing rituals. \nDomestic tourism however has gone down over the past few years. A contributing factor to this is the treatment of domestic tourists by the local guides in the area where it has been reported that local guides are more willing to entertain foreign visitors. The Batad Environmental Tour Guides Association (BETGA) in association with the Batad Baranguay authorities are currently laying a concrete track down from the Batad Saddle to the village proper.\n\nThe park is featured on the reverse side of the 1985 series of the Philippine one thousand peso note as well as the reverse side of the 2010 series of the Philippine twenty peso note.\n\nAside from the Banaue Rice terraces there are 4 other similar terraces, Soil type here in this mountainous province are that ones like what they used to fabricate clay pot or a clay jar, (also used in the construction by firing clay), the Batad Rice Terraces, Mayoyao Rice Terraces in Mayoyao, Hapao Rice Terraces and Kiangan Rice Terraces. The Batad Rice Terraces are located in Barangay Batad in Banaue, these terraces shaped resembles an amphitheatre. The Mayoyao Rice Terraces are for a rice variety called \"tinawon\", a rare type of organic rice which are grown in red and white variety in these terraces. The Hapao Rice Terraces are located in Hungduan, these terraces are stone-walled from Sagada rock formation and date back to 650 AD. The Kiangan Rice Terraces is are in Banaue, on which are grown the rice varieties of nagacadan and julungan.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "51614", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51614", "title": "Biology and sexual orientation", "text": "Biology and sexual orientation\n\nThe relationship between biology and sexual orientation is a subject of research. While scientists do not know the exact cause of sexual orientation, they theorize that a combination of genetic, hormonal, and social factors determine it. Hypotheses for the impact of the post-natal social environment on sexual orientation, however, are weak, especially for males.\n\nBiological theories for explaining the causes of sexual orientation are favored by scientists and involve a complex interplay of genetic factors, the early uterine environment and brain structure. These factors, which may be related to the development of a heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, or asexual orientation, include genes, prenatal hormones, and brain structure.\n\nA number of twin studies have attempted to compare the relative importance of genetics and environment in the determination of sexual orientation. In a 1991 study, Bailey and Pillard conducted a study of male twins recruited from \"homophile publications\", and found that 52% of monozygotic (MZ) brothers (of whom 59 were questioned) and 22% of the dizygotic (DZ) twins were concordant for homosexuality. 'MZ' indicates identical twins with the same sets of genes and 'DZ' indicates fraternal twins where genes are mixed to an extent similar to that of non-twin siblings. In a study of 61 pairs of twins, researchers found among their mostly male subjects a concordance rate for homosexuality of 66% among monozygotic twins and a 30% one among dizygotic twins. In 2000 Bailey, Dunne and Martin studied a larger sample of 4,901 Australian twins but reported less than half the level of concordance. They found 20% concordance in the male identical or MZ twins and 24% concordance for the female identical or MZ twins. Self reported zygosity, sexual attraction, fantasy and behaviours were assessed by questionnaire and zygosity was serologically checked when in doubt. Other researchers support biological causes for both men and women's sexual orientation.\n\nBearman and Brückner (2002) criticized early studies concentrating on small, select samples and non-representative selection of their subjects. They studied 289 pairs of identical twins (monozygotic, or from one fertilized egg) and 495 pairs of fraternal twins (dizygotic, or from two fertilized eggs) and found concordance rates for same-sex attraction of only 7.7% for male identical twins and 5.3% for females, a pattern which they say \"does not suggest genetic influence independent of social context\".\n\nA 2010 study of all adult twins in Sweden (more than 7,600 twins) found that same-sex behavior was explained by both heritable factors and individual-specific environmental sources (such as prenatal environment, experience with illness and trauma, as well as peer groups, and sexual experiences), while influences of shared-environment variables such as familial environment and social attitudes had a weaker, but significant effect. Women showed a statistically non-significant trend to weaker influence of hereditary effects, while men showed no effect of shared environmental effects. The use of all adult twins in Sweden was designed to address the criticism of volunteer studies, in which a potential bias towards participation by gay twins may influence the results;\n\nTwin studies have received a number of criticisms including self-selection bias where homosexuals with gay siblings are more likely to volunteer for studies. Nonetheless, it is possible to conclude that, given the difference in sexuality in so many sets of identical twins, sexual orientation cannot be attributed solely to genetic factors.\n\nAnother issue is the finding that even monozygotic twins can be different and there is a mechanism which might account for monozygotic twins being discordant for homosexuality. Gringas and Chen (2001) describe a number of mechanisms which can lead to differences between monozygotic twins, the most relevant here being chorionicity and amniocity. Dichorionic twins potentially have different hormonal environments because they receive maternal blood from separate placenta, and this could result in different levels of brain masculinisation. Monoamniotic twins share a hormonal environment, but can suffer from the 'twin to twin transfusion syndrome' in which one twin is \"relatively stuffed with blood and the other exsanguinated\".\n\nChromosome linkage studies of sexual orientation have indicated the presence of multiple contributing genetic factors throughout the genome. In 1993 Dean Hamer and colleagues published findings from a linkage analysis of a sample of 76 gay brothers and their families. Hamer et al. found that the gay men had more gay male uncles and cousins on the maternal side of the family than on the paternal side. Gay brothers who showed this maternal pedigree were then tested for X chromosome linkage, using twenty-two markers on the X chromosome to test for similar alleles. In another finding, thirty-three of the forty sibling pairs tested were found to have similar alleles in the distal region of Xq28, which was significantly higher than the expected rates of 50% for fraternal brothers. This was popularly dubbed the \"gay gene\" in the media, causing significant controversy. Sanders et al. in 1998 reported on their similar study, in which they found that 13% of uncles of gay brothers on the maternal side were homosexual, compared with 6% on the paternal side.\n\nA later analysis by Hu et al. replicated and refined the earlier findings. This study revealed that 67% of gay brothers in a new saturated sample shared a marker on the X chromosome at Xq28. Two other studies (Bailey et al., 1999; McKnight and Malcolm, 2000) failed to find a preponderance of gay relatives in the maternal line of homosexual men. One study by Rice et al. in 1999 failed to replicate the Xq28 linkage results. Meta-analysis of all available linkage data indicates a significant link to Xq28, but also indicates that additional genes must be present to account for the full heritability of sexual orientation.\n\nMustanski et al. (2005) performed a full-genome scan (instead of just an X chromosome scan) on individuals and families previously reported on in Hamer et al. (1993) and Hu et al. (1995), as well as additional new subjects. In the full sample they did not find linkage to Xq28.\n\nResults from the first large, comprehensive multi-center genetic linkage study of male sexual orientation were reported by an independent group of researchers at the American Society of Human Genetics in 2012. The study population included 409 independent pairs of gay brothers, who were analyzed with over 300,000 single-nucleotide polymorphism markers. The data strongly replicated Hamer's Xq28 findings as determined by both two-point and multipoint (MERLIN) LOD score mapping. Significant linkage was also detected in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 8, overlapping with one of the regions detected in the Hamer lab's previous genomewide study. The authors concluded that \"our findings, taken in context with previous work, suggest that genetic variation in each of these regions contributes to development of the important psychological trait of male sexual orientation\". Female sexual orientation does not seem to be linked to Xq28, though it does appear moderately heritable.\n\nIn addition to sex chromosomal contribution, a potential autosomal genetic contribution to the development of homosexual orientation has also been suggested. In a study population composed of more than 7000 participants, Ellis et al. (2008) found a statistically significant difference in the frequency of blood type A between homosexuals and heterosexuals. They also found that \"unusually high\" proportions of homosexual males and homosexual females were Rh negative in comparison to heterosexuals. As both blood type and Rh factor are genetically inherited traits controlled by alleles located on chromosome 9 and chromosome 1 respectively, the study indicates a potential link between genes on autosomes and homosexuality.\n\nThe biology of sexual orientation has been studied in detail in several animal model systems. In the common fruit fly \"Drosophila melanogaster\", the complete pathway of sexual differentiation of the brain and the behaviors it controls is well established in both males and females, providing a concise model of biologically controlled courtship. In mammals, a group of geneticists at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology altered the sexual preferences of female mice by removing a single gene linked to reproductive behavior. Without the gene, the mice exhibited masculine sexual behavior and attraction toward urine of other female mice. Those mice who retained the gene fucose mutarotase (FucM) were attracted to male mice.\n\nIn interviews to the press, researchers have pointed that the evidence of genetic influences should not be equated with genetic determinism. According to Dean Hamer and Michael Bailey, genetic aspects are only one of the multiple causes of homosexuality.\n\nIn 2017, \"Nature\" published an article with a genome wide association study on male sexual orientation. The research consisted of 1,077 homosexual men and 1,231 heterosexual men. A gene named SLITRK6 on chromosome 13 was identified, and contains an area or DNA sequence which is different for gay men than for heterosexual men. The research supports another study which had been done by Simon levay. Levay's research suggested that the hypothalamus of gay men is different from straight men. The SLITRK6 is active in the mid-brain where the hypothalamus is. The researchers found another gene, named \"thyroid stimulating hormone receptor\" (TSHR) on chromosome 14 which dna sequence is different also for gay men. TSHR stimulates thyroid and grave disease interrupted the function of TSHR. The previous research also indicated that grave disease had been seen more in gay men than in straight men. Research indicated that gay people have lower body weight than straight people. It had been presumed that the overactive TSHR hormone lowered body weight in gay people.\n\nA study suggests linkage between a mother's genetic make-up and homosexuality of her sons. Women have two X chromosomes, one of which is \"switched off\". The inactivation of the X chromosome occurs randomly throughout the embryo, resulting in cells that are mosaic with respect to which chromosome is active. In some cases though, it appears that this switching off can occur in a non-random fashion. Bocklandt et al. (2006) reported that, in mothers of homosexual men, the number of women with extreme skewing of X chromosome inactivation is significantly higher than in mothers without gay sons. 13% of mothers with one gay son, and 23% of mothers with two gay sons, showed extreme skewing, compared to 4% of mothers without gay sons.\n\nBlanchard and Klassen (1997) reported that each additional older brother increases the odds of a man being gay by 33%. This is now \"one of the most reliable epidemiological variables ever identified in the study of sexual orientation\". To explain this finding, it has been proposed that male fetuses provoke a maternal immune reaction that becomes stronger with each successive male fetus.\nThis maternal immunization hypothesis (MIH) begins when cells from a male fetus enter the mother's circulation during pregnancy or while giving birth.\nMale fetuses produce H-Y antigens which are \"almost certainly involved in the sexual differentiation of vertebrates\".\nThese Y-linked proteins would not be recognized in the mother's immune system because she is female, causing her to develop antibodies which would travel through the placental barrier into the fetal compartment. From here, the anti-male bodies would then cross the blood/brain barrier (BBB) of the developing fetal brain, altering sex-dimorphic brain structures relative to sexual orientation, increasing the likelihood that the exposed son will be more attracted to men than women.\nIt is this antigen which maternal H-Y antibodies are proposed to both react to and 'remember'. Successive male fetuses are then attacked by H-Y antibodies which somehow decrease the ability of H-Y antigens to perform their usual function in brain masculinisation.\n\nHowever, the maternal immune hypothesis has been criticized because the prevalence of the type of immune attack proposed is rare compared with the prevalence of homosexuality.\n\nThe \"fraternal birth order effect\" however, cannot account for between 71-85% of male homosexual preference. Additionally, it does not explain instances where a firstborn child displays male homosexual preference (MHP).\n\nIn 2017, researchers discovered a biological mechanism of gay people who tend to have older brothers. They think Neuroligin 4 Y-linked protein is responsible for a later son being gay. They found that women had significantly higher anti-NLGN4Y levels than men. The result also indicates that number of pregnancies, mothers of gay sons, particularly those with older brothers, had significantly higher anti-NLGN4Y levels than did the control samples of women, including mothers of heterosexual sons.\n\nIn 2004, Italian researchers conducted a study of about 4,600 people who were the relatives of 98 homosexual and 100 heterosexual men. Female relatives of the homosexual men tended to have more offspring than those of the heterosexual men. Female relatives of the homosexual men on their mother's side tended to have more offspring than those on the father's side. The researchers concluded that there was genetic material being passed down on the X chromosome which both promotes fertility in the mother and homosexuality in her male offspring. The connections discovered would explain about 20% of the cases studied, indicating that this is a highly significant but not the sole genetic factor determining sexual orientation.\n\nResearch conducted in Sweden has suggested that gay and straight men respond differently to two odors that are believed to be involved in sexual arousal. The research showed that when both heterosexual women and gay men are exposed to a testosterone derivative found in men's sweat, a region in the hypothalamus is activated. Heterosexual men, on the other hand, have a similar response to an estrogen-like compound found in women's urine. The conclusion is that sexual attraction, whether same-sex or opposite-sex oriented, operates similarly on a biological level. Researchers have suggested that this possibility could be further explored by studying young subjects to see if similar responses in the hypothalamus are found and then correlating these data with adult sexual orientation.\n\nA number of sections of the brain have been reported to be sexually dimorphic; that is, they vary between men and women. There have also been reports of variations in brain structure corresponding to sexual orientation. In 1990, Dick Swaab and Michel A. Hofman reported a difference in the size of the suprachiasmatic nucleus between homosexual and heterosexual men. In 1992, Allen and Gorski reported a difference related to sexual orientation in the size of the anterior commissure, but this research was refuted by numerous studies, one of which found that the entirety of the variation was caused by a single outlier.\n\nResearch on the physiologic differences between male and female brains are based on the idea that people have male or a female brain, and this mirrors the behavioral differences between the two sexes. Some researchers state that solid scientific support for this is lacking. Although consistent differences have been identified, including the size of the brain and of specific brain regions, male and female brains are very similar.\n\nSimon LeVay, too, conducted some of these early researches. He studied four groups of neurons in the hypothalamus called INAH1, INAH2, INAH3 and INAH4. This was a relevant area of the brain to study, because of evidence that it played a role in the regulation of sexual behaviour in animals, and because INAH2 and INAH3 had previously been reported to differ in size between men and women.\n\nHe obtained brains from 41 deceased hospital patients. The subjects were classified into three groups. The first group comprised 19 gay men who had died of AIDS-related illnesses. The second group comprised 16 men whose sexual orientation was unknown, but whom the researchers presumed to be heterosexual. Six of these men had died of AIDS-related illnesses. The third group was of six women whom the researchers presumed to be heterosexual. One of the women had died of an AIDS-related illness.\n\nThe HIV-positive people in the presumably heterosexual patient groups were all identified from medical records as either intravenous drug abusers or recipients of blood transfusions. Two of the men who identified as heterosexual specifically denied ever engaging in a homosexual sex act. The records of the remaining heterosexual subjects contained no information about their sexual orientation; they were assumed to have been primarily or exclusively heterosexual \"on the basis of the numerical preponderance of heterosexual men in the population\".\n\nLeVay found no evidence for a difference between the groups in the size of INAH1, INAH2 or INAH4. However, the INAH3 group appeared to be twice as big in the heterosexual male group as in the gay male group; the difference was highly significant, and remained significant when only the six AIDS patients were included in the heterosexual group. The size of INAH3 in the homosexual men's brains was comparable to the size of INAH3 in the heterosexual women's brains.\n\nHowever, other studies have shown that the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area, which include the INAH3, are of similar size in homosexual males who died of AIDS to heterosexual males, and therefore larger than female. This clearly contradicts the hypothesis that homosexual males have a female hypothalamus. Furthermore, the SCN of homosexual males is extremely large (both the volume and the number of neurons are twice as many as in heterosexual males). These areas of the hypothalamus have not yet been explored in homosexual females nor bisexual males nor females. Although the functional implications of such findings still haven't been examined in detail, they cast serious doubt over the widely accepted Dörner hypothesis that homosexual males have a \"female hypothalamus\" and that the key mechanism of differentiating the \"male brain from originally female brain\" is the epigenetic influence of testosterone during prenatal development.\n\nWilliam Byne and colleagues attempted to identify the size differences reported in INAH 1–4 by replicating the experiment using brain sample from other subjects: 14 HIV-positive homosexual males, 34 presumed heterosexual males (10 HIV-positive), and 34 presumed heterosexual females (9 HIV-positive). The researchers found a significant difference in INAH3 size between heterosexual men and heterosexual women. The INAH3 size of the homosexual men was apparently smaller than that of the heterosexual men, and larger than that of the heterosexual women, though neither difference quite reached statistical significance.\n\nByne and colleagues also weighed and counted numbers of neurons in INAH3 tests not carried out by LeVay. The results for INAH3 weight were similar to those for INAH3 size; that is, the INAH3 weight for the heterosexual male brains was significantly larger than for the heterosexual female brains, while the results for the gay male group were between those of the other two groups but not quite significantly different from either. The neuron count also found a male-female difference in INAH3, but found no trend related to sexual orientation.\n\nA 2010 study, Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab asserted that \"the fetal brain develops during the intrauterine period in the male direction through a direct action of testosterone on the developing nerve cells, or in the female direction through the absence of this hormone surge. In this way, our gender identity (the conviction of belonging to the male or female gender) and sexual orientation are programmed or organized into our brain structures when we are still in the womb. There is no indication that social environment after birth has an effect on gender identity or sexual orientation.\"\n\nThe domestic ram is used as an experimental model to study early programming of the neural mechanisms which underlie homosexuality, developing from the observation that approximately 8% of domestic rams are sexually attracted to other rams (male-oriented) when compared to the majority of rams which are female-oriented. In many species, a prominent feature of sexual differentiation is the presence of a sexually dimorphic nucleus (SDN) in the preoptic hypothalamus, which is larger in males than in females.\n\nRoselli et al. discovered an ovine SDN (oSDN) in the preoptic hypothalamus that is smaller in male-oriented rams than in female-oriented rams, but similar in size to the oSDN of females. Neurons of the oSDN show aromatase expression which is also smaller in male-oriented rams versus female-oriented rams, suggesting that sexual orientation is neurologically hard-wired and may be influenced by hormones. However, results failed to associate the role of neural aromatase in the sexual differentiation of brain and behavior in the sheep, due to the lack of defeminization of adult sexual partner preference or oSDN volume as a result of aromatase activity in the brain of the fetuses during the critical period. Having said this, it is more likely that oSDN morphology and homosexuality may be programmed through an androgen receptor that does not involve aromatisation. Most of the data suggests that homosexual rams, like female-oriented rams, are masculinized and defeminized with respect to mounting, receptivity, and gonadotrophin secretion, but are not defeminized for sexual partner preferences, also suggesting that such behaviors may be programmed differently. Although the exact function of the oSDN is not fully known, its volume, length, and cell number seem to correlate with sexual orientation, and a dimorphism in its volume and of cells could bias the processing cues involved in partner selection. More research is needed in order to understand the requirements and timing of the development of the oSDN and how prenatal programming effects the expression of mate choice in adulthood.\n\nThe early fixation hypothesis includes research into prenatal development and the environmental factors that control masculinization of the brain. Some studies have seen pre-natal hormone exposures as the primary factor involved in determining sexual orientation. This hypothesis is supported by both the observed differences in brain structure and cognitive processing between homosexual and heterosexual men. One explanation for these differences is the idea that differential exposure to hormone levels in the womb during fetal development may change the masculinization of the brain in homosexual men. The concentrations of these chemicals is thought to be influenced by fetal and maternal immune systems, maternal consumption of certain drugs, maternal stress, and direct injection. This hypothesis is also connected to the fraternal birth order research.\n\nDaryl Bem, a social psychologist at Cornell University, has theorized that the influence of biological factors on sexual orientation may be mediated by experiences in childhood. A child's temperament predisposes the child to prefer certain activities over others. Because of their temperament, which is influenced by biological variables such as genetic factors, some children will be attracted to activities that are commonly enjoyed by other children of the same gender. Others will prefer activities that are typical of another gender. This will make a gender-conforming child feel different from opposite-gender children, while gender-nonconforming children will feel different from children of their own gender. According to Bem, this feeling of difference will evoke psychological arousal when the child is near members of the gender which it considers as being 'different'. Bem theorizes that this psychological arousal will later be transformed into sexual arousal: children will become sexually attracted to the gender which they see as different (\"exotic\"). This proposal is known as the \"exotic becomes erotic\" theory.\n\nBem sought support from published literature but did not present new data testing his theory. Research cited by him as evidence of the \"exotic becomes erotic\" theory includes the study \"Sexual Preference\" by Bell et al. (1981) and studies showing the frequent finding that a majority of gay men and lesbians report being gender-nonconforming during their childhood years. A meta-analysis of 48 studies showed childhood gender nonconformity to be the strongest predictor of a homosexual orientation for both men and women. In six \"prospective\" studies—that is, longitudinal studies that began with gender-nonconforming boys at about age 7 and followed them up into adolescence and adulthood— 63% of the gender nonconforming boys had a homosexual or bisexual orientation as adults.\n\nSexual practices that significantly reduce the frequency of heterosexual intercourse also significantly decrease the chances of successful reproduction, and for this reason, they would appear to be maladaptive in an evolutionary context following a simple Darwinian model (competition amongst individuals) of natural selection—on the assumption that homosexuality would reduce this frequency. Several theories have been advanced to explain this contradiction, and new experimental evidence has demonstrated their feasibility.\n\nSome scholars have suggested that homosexuality is indirectly adaptive, by conferring a reproductive advantage in a non-obvious way on heterosexual siblings or their children. By way of analogy, the allele (a particular version of a gene) which causes sickle-cell anemia when two copies are present, also confers resistance to malaria with a lesser form of anemia when one copy is present (this is called heterozygous advantage).\n\nScholars have also pointed out that Darwin himself described kin selection in The Origin of Species, so under a Darwinian model of evolution, not only individuals, but family groups (bloodlines) can compete for selection.\n\nBrendan Zietsch of the Queensland Institute of Medical Research proposes the alternative theory that men exhibiting female traits become more attractive to females and are thus more likely to mate, provided the genes involved do not drive them to complete rejection of heterosexuality.\n\nIn a 2008 study, its authors stated that \"There is considerable evidence that human sexual orientation is genetically influenced, so it is not known how homosexuality, which tends to lower reproductive success, is maintained in the population at a relatively high frequency.\" They hypothesized that \"while genes predisposing to homosexuality reduce homosexuals' reproductive success, they may confer some advantage in heterosexuals who carry them\". Their results suggested that \"genes predisposing to homosexuality may confer a mating advantage in heterosexuals, which could help explain the evolution and maintenance of homosexuality in the population\".\n\nHowever, in the same study, the authors noted that \"nongenetic alternative explanations cannot be ruled out\" as a reason for the heterosexual in the homosexual-heterosexual twin pair having more partners, specifically citing \"social pressure on the other twin to act in a more heterosexual way\" (and thus seek out a greater number of sexual partners) as an example of one alternative explanation. Also, the authors of the study acknowledge that a large number of sexual partners may not lead to greater reproductive success, specifically noting there is an \"absence of evidence relating the number of sexual partners and actual reproductive success, either in the present or in our evolutionary past\".\n\nThe heterosexual advantage hypothesis was given strong support by the 2004 Italian study demonstrating increased fecundity in the female matrilineal relatives of gay men. As originally pointed out by Hamer, even a modest increase in reproductive capacity in females carrying a \"gay gene\" could easily account for its maintenance at high levels in the population.\n\nThe \"gay uncle hypothesis\" posits that people who themselves do not have children may nonetheless increase the prevalence of their family's genes in future generations by providing resources (e.g., food, supervision, defense, shelter) to the offspring of their closest relatives.\n\nThis hypothesis is an extension of the theory of kin selection, which was originally developed to explain apparent altruistic acts which seemed to be maladaptive. The initial concept was suggested by J. B. S. Haldane in 1932 and later elaborated by many others including John Maynard Smith, W. D. Hamilton and Mary Jane West-Eberhard. This concept was also used to explain the patterns of certain social insects where most of the members are non-reproductive.\n\nVasey and VanderLaan (2010) tested the theory on the Pacific island of Samoa, where they studied women, straight men, and the fa'afafine, men who prefer other men as sexual partners and are accepted within the culture as a distinct third gender category. Vasey and VanderLaan found that the fa'afafine said they were significantly more willing to help kin, yet much less interested in helping children who aren't family, providing the first evidence to support the kin selection hypothesis.\n\nThe hypothesis is consistent with other studies on homosexuality, which show that it is more prevalent amongst both siblings and twins. Since both twins and non-twin siblings share genes and therefore have a higher factor of genetic redundancy, there is less genetic familial risk if the strategy is expressed. It is speculated that environmental and hormonal stress factors (linked to resource feedbacks) may act as triggers.\n\nSince the hypothesis solves the problem of why homosexuality has not been selected out over thousands of years, despite it being antithetical to reproduction, many scientists consider it the best explanatory model for non-heterosexual behaviour such as homosexuality and bisexuality. The natural bell curve variation that occurs in biology and sociology everywhere, explains the variable spectrum of expression.\n\nVasal and VanderLaan (2011) provides evidence that if an adaptively designed avuncular male androphilic phenotype exists and its development is contingent on a particular social environment, then a collectivistic cultural context is insufficient, in and of itself, for the expression of such a phenotype.\n\nSome studies have found correlations between physiology of people and their sexuality; these studies provide evidence which suggests that:\n\n\nWhether genetic or other physiological determinants form the basis of sexual orientation is a highly politicized issue. \"The Advocate\", a U.S. gay and lesbian newsmagazine, reported in 1996 that 61% of its readers believed that \"it would mostly help gay and lesbian rights if homosexuality were found to be biologically determined\". A cross-national study in the United States, the Philippines, and Sweden found that those who believed that \"homosexuals are born that way\" held significantly more positive attitudes toward homosexuality than those who believed that \"homosexuals choose to be that way\" or \"learn to be that way\".\n\nEqual protection analysis in U.S. law determines when government requirements create a “suspect classification\" of groups and therefore eligible for heightened scrutiny based on several factors, one of which is immutability.\n\nEvidence that sexual orientation is biologically determined (and therefore perhaps immutable in the legal sense) would strengthen the legal case for heightened scrutiny of laws discriminating on that basis.\n\nThe perceived causes of sexual orientation have a significant bearing on the status of sexual minorities in the eyes of social conservatives. The Family Research Council, a conservative Christian think tank in Washington, D.C., argues in the book \"Getting It Straight\" that finding people are born gay \"would advance the idea that sexual orientation is an innate characteristic, like race; that homosexuals, like African-Americans, should be legally protected against 'discrimination;' and that disapproval of homosexuality should be as socially stigmatized as racism. However, it is not true.\" On the other hand, some social conservatives such as Reverend Robert Schenck have argued that people can accept any scientific evidence while still morally opposing homosexuality. National Organization for Marriage board member and fiction writer Orson Scott Card has supported biological research on homosexuality, writing that \"our scientific efforts in regard to homosexuality should be to identify genetic and uterine causes... so that the incidence of this dysfunction can be minimized... [However, this should not be seen] as an attack on homosexuals, a desire to 'commit genocide' against the homosexual community... There is no 'cure' for homosexuality because it is not a disease. There are, however, different ways of living with homosexual desires.\"\n\nSome advocates for the rights of sexual minorities resist linking that cause with the concept that sexuality is biologically determined or fixed at birth. They argue that sexual orientation can shift over the course of a person's life. At the same time, others resist any attempts to pathologise or medicalise 'deviant' sexuality, and choose to fight for acceptance in a moral or social realm. Chandler Burr has stated that \"[s]ome, recalling earlier psychiatric \"treatments\" for homosexuality, discern in the biological quest the seeds of genocide. They conjure up the specter of the surgical or chemical \"rewiring\" of gay people, or of abortions of fetal homosexuals who have been hunted down in the womb.\" LeVay has said in response to letters from gays and lesbians making such criticisms that the research \"has contributed to the status of gay people in society\".\n\n\n"}

Breast milk keepsakes come in various jewelry types such as rings, lockets, pendants and popular European style beads. Pendants may include custom background colors, children's names and be made in many shape choices. Some pendants may be bezel set, locket set, made from only resin, or filled. Filled styles use a preserved breast milk and resin mix to fill holes or openings in jewelry pieces, usually Sterling Silver. Generally, the filled shapes are trees, leaves, or hearts representing love and life.\n\nVarious methods may be used to make the jewelry. To preserve and protect it, the piece may be covered in a clear resin or glaze. No matter the process used for preservation there seems to be a long and tedious process involved in creating the keepsakes, leading to long waits for order fulfillment. The long waits for order fulfillment have caused online speculation about the practice, even gaining media attention. \n\nAfter the purchase of a breast milk keepsake design the consumer sends their breast milk to the creator so the process can begin. Each creator likely uses a different trade process. In some methods it's believed that solvents or chemicals are added to assist the preservation.

It was founded in 1945 by Céline Vipiana. Since November 2015, the headquarters are located at 16 rue Vivienne in the 2nd arrondissement of Paris at the Hôtel Colbert de Torcy, which has French Historic Monument classification. Séverine Merle is the Chief Executive Officer since April 2017.\n\nOn January 21, 2018, LVMH announced that Hedi Slimane will take over at Celine as its artistic, creative and image director.\n\nIn 1945, Céline Vipiana (1915–1997) and her husband, Richard, created one of the first luxury brands in the industry, Céline, a made-to-measure children's shoe business, and opened a first boutique at 52 rue Malte in Paris. The brand was recognised by its logo, the red elephant created by Raymont Peynet.\n\nIn 1960, the brand decided to change its positioning by focusing its business on a ready-to-wear fashion brand for women with a sportswear approach. Henceforth, the brand offered a range of leather goods such as bags, loafers, gloves and clothes. Céline Vipiana remained the designer from 1945-1997.\n\nIn 1964, the launch of the new fragrance \"Vent fou\" and the new ‘American Sulky’ collection of accessories gained success. The trench became the chief product of the house. Prompted by the popularity of leather, Céline opened a leather goods factory in Florence.\n\nIn 1973, Céline redesigned its logo with the intertwined \"C\" Sulky canvas, linked to the Arc-de-Triomphe, which appeared as a symbol for Parisians. At that time, Céline began its expansion in the world with the opening of various boutiques in Monte Carlo, Geneva, Hong Kong, Lausanne, Toronto and Beverly Hills.\n\nThe brand’s founders wished to be part of a charitable association, so Richard Vipiana established the Céline-Pasteur Prize, a sponsor for the American Hospital of Paris in 1973.\n\nIn 1987, Bernard Arnault decided to buy into Céline’s capital. However, it was only in 1996 that the brand was integrated into the LVMH group for 2.7 billion French francs ($540 million). LVMH propelled the brand to fame with the opening of a boutique at 36 avenue Montaigne in Paris.\n\nAmerican fashion designer Michael Kors was named the first ever women's ready-to-wear designer and creative director for Céline in 1997. During his tenure at Céline, Kors brought modern femininity with a luxurious spirit. In 2004, he left the fashion luxury house to focus his career on his own brand.\n\nIn 2005, Italian designer Roberto Menichetti was named creative director.\n\nA year later, Croatian designer Ivana Omazic directed the design studio. Omazic was a former consultant for the brand and previously worked with Romeo Gigli, Prada, Jil Sander and Miu Miu. Omazic designed for Céline until 2008, after further disappointments for the brand.\n\nOn September 4, 2008, the fashion portal \"Women's Wear Daily\" announced that Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, had appointed Phoebe Philo as the new creative director of Céline. Philo's tenure at Céline began in October 2008, and she presented her first ready-to-wear collection for Spring/Summer 2010 at Paris Fashion Week. Pierre-Yves Roussel, chief executive officer of LVMH’s fashion division, said that recruiting Philo was giving her the opportunity to express her vision.\nIn 2009, Vogue Magazine defined her style as the “cool minimal trend”.\n\nPhilo studied at Central Saint Martins School of Art and Design in London. Prior to Céline, Philo held the position of Design Director at Chloé.\n\nIn 2010, Philo received the Designer of the Year award from British Fashion Council. In 2011, she was awarded International Designer of the Year by the Council of Fashion Designers of America. Both prizes were awarded for her work at Céline.\n\nIn December 2017, Philo announced her departure from Céline after finishing the Fall 2018 collection, which is to presented in March of that same year.\n\nOn January 21, 2018, LVMH announced the appointment of Hedi Slimane as \"Artistic, Creative and Image Director\", set to join the house on February 1. He is to direct all Céline collections, extending the brand's offering with the launch of men’s fashion, couture and fragrances. In September 2018, Slimane presented an updated Celine logo on the brand's Instagram account.\n\nDakota Johnson was the first celebrity to wear Slimane’s first Celine collection on the red carpet for the Los Angeles premiere of Suspiria.\n\nThe brand owns almost 150 stores worldwide and is distributed through a selective network including department stores such as Barneys New York (New York), Bergdorf Goodman (New York), Harrods (London) and Galeries Lafayette (Paris).\n\n"}
{"id": "1410865", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1410865", "title": "Cersei Lannister", "text": "Cersei Lannister\n\nCersei Lannister is a fictional character in the \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series of fantasy novels by American author George R. R. Martin, and its television adaptation \"Game of Thrones\", where she is portrayed by English actress Lena Headey. In the novels, she is a point of view character.\n\nIntroduced in 1996's \"A Game of Thrones\", Cersei is a member of House Lannister, one of the wealthiest and most powerful families in the kingdom of Westeros. She subsequently appeared in \"A Clash of Kings\" (1998) and \"A Storm of Swords\" (2000). She becomes a prominent point of view character in the novels beginning in \"A Feast for Crows\" (2005) and \"A Dance with Dragons\" (2011). The character will also appear in the forthcoming volume \"The Winds of Winter\".\n\nIn the story, Cersei Lannister, Queen of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, is the wife of King Robert Baratheon. Her father arranged the marriage after his attempt to betroth her to Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, as she wanted, failed. The Targaryen dynasty lost the war, and her father schemed his way into the role of a political counselor for the newly crowned King Robert. The Lannisters are the richest family in Westeros and helped him to win the Throne, which is why Robert agreed to a marriage between them. Cersei has a twin brother, Jaime, with whom she has been involved in an incestuous affair. All three of Cersei's children are Jaime's. Cersei's main character attribute is her desire for power and her ambition.\n\nHeadey has received critical acclaim for her portrayal of the character on the HBO series \"Game of Thrones\". She has been nominated for four Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series and a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress for her performance. Headey and the rest of the cast were nominated for Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series in 2012, 2014, 2015 and 2016. In season 5, a young version of the character is portrayed by Nell Williams in a flashback.\n\nCersei was born the only daughter and first child of Tywin Lannister and his wife Joanna, with her twin brother Jaime born soon after. Cersei and Jaime looked so similar as children that Cersei occasionally wore Jaime’s clothes and was mistaken for him. They even went as far as to experiment sexually at an early age but were discovered by a servant who informed their mother. She decided to separate them using a guard and keep this a secret from their father, threatening them that she would inform him if they ever repeated it. Soon after, her mother died giving birth to their dwarf brother Tyrion. Cersei blamed Tyrion for her death, and started to abuse him as a baby. Martin said in \"Rolling Stone\":\n\nTywin hoped his daughter would marry Rhaegar Targaryen from a very young age and rejected the Princess of Dorne's proposal to betroth Oberyn Martell and Elia Martell to her and Jaime respectively. She became infatuated with Rhaegar and even hid her infatuation from her brother as her father advised her. At the age of eleven, Jaime was sent away to serve as a squire for Lord Sumner Crakehall. A year later, Aerys Targaryen rejected Cersei's marriage to his son, humiliating Tywin. Tywin took Cersei to King's Landing and, in the following years, refused every other offer of marriage for her. In 281 AC, when Cersei and Jaime were fifteen, Jaime, newly knighted on the battlefield, came to King's Landing on his way to Casterly Rock to visit his sister, from whom he had been separated for years. She informed him that their father planned to marry him to Lysa Tully and persuaded him to join the Kingsguard in order to be near her, after sleeping together for the first time. They started an affair which lasted until the morning of her marriage to Robert Baratheon. While she was happy marrying Robert at first, he didn't return her affections and repeatedly cheated on her. She then resumed her incestuous affair with her brother, resulting in the births of Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen.\n\nDuring her teenage years, believing that her betrothal to Rhaegar would soon be announced, Cersei brought her companions Melara Hetherspoon and Jeyne Farman to a witch named Maggy the Frog. Jeyne was instantly frightened and left the tent. Cersei and Melara stayed and tried to get the witch to tell them a prophecy. In the face of Cersei's threats, Maggy agreed to answer three questions. Maggy told Cersei she would marry the king and not the prince, and that she would be overthrown by a younger and more beautiful queen. She further predicted that Cersei's children will die during her lifetime and that the valonqar (High Valyrian for \"little brother\") would come to end her life. Melara then asked if she would marry Jaime, to which Maggy answered that she wouldn't marry anyone and that her death was near her and would happen that night. It is implied that Cersei killed the girl to prevent her speaking of the prophecies and for being greedy with ideas above her social status. Cersei spends her entire adult life attempting to subvert the prophecy and eventually develops a strong paranoia over this.\n\nRobert, Cersei and most of the court visit the North to appoint Eddard Stark as Hand of the King. During the royal visit to Winterfell, Eddard's son Bran finds Cersei committing incest with Jaime in a tower. To prevent their adultery from being revealed, Jaime pushes Bran from the tower; Bran survives, but has no memory of the fall and is left paraplegic.\n\nEddard eventually discovers the truth of Cersei's infidelity and confronts her, giving her the opportunity to flee into exile and thus spare her children certain execution. Cersei had already arranged Robert's death in a hunting accident. When Robert dies, Cersei seizes control as regent and has Eddard arrested for treason. Cersei intends for Eddard to publicly confess and join the Night's Watch as punishment, but Joffrey orders Ned executed instead.\n\nFrustrated with Cersei's many political blunders, as well as her failure to control Joffrey, Tywin appoints Tyrion as Hand of the King with explicit instructions to control Cersei and Joffrey. Once at the capital, Tyrion enters into a bitter power struggle with Cersei, subverting her authority and removing her supporters from positions of power. In Jaime's absence, Cersei begins taking other lovers, including Lancel. When Stannis Baratheon sails on King's Landing, Cersei and Joffrey hide in a tower, leaving Tyrion to mastermind the defense of the city. Ultimately, Tywin arrives in time to force Stannis to retreat and save the city.\n\nAfter formally assuming his position as Hand of the King, Tywin makes it clear to Cersei that she is no longer welcome at Small Council meetings, \"de facto\" stripping her of political authority. Furthermore, Tywin intends to wed Cersei to Wilas Tyrell in order to form an alliance with House Tyrell. This state of affairs is shaken when Joffrey is poisoned at his wedding feast. Maddened with grief at the loss of her eldest son, Cersei lashes out against Tyrion, accusing him of poisoning the king out of revenge.\n\nCersei manipulates Tyrion's trial to ensure a guilty verdict, bribing and intimidating witnesses. When Tyrion demands a trial by combat, Cersei selects the imposing Gregor Clegane, \"The Mountain,\" as the Crown's champion. The Mountain prevails, killing Tyrion's champion Oberyn Martell. Tywin then pronounces Tyrion guilty and sentences him to death, but Tyrion escapes prison and kills Tywin. Cersei is once again in complete control of the capital.\n\nWith the death of her father and her son, Cersei \"de facto\" rules the kingdom. Her youngest child, Tommen Baratheon, is crowned king but is widely considered weak, signing every decree that passes in front of him. However, Cersei rules a kingdom on the brink of ruin. The huge losses suffered by House Lannister in the war, combined with the wartime disruptions to trade and harvest mean that the Lannisters are dependent on resources from House Tyrell. The Tyrells leverage this position and begin to build power in the capital, much to Cersei's consternation.\n\nFurthermore, Cersei makes a series of political and economic blunders, alienating allies such as Pycelle and Kevan Lannister. In an attempt to undermine the Tyrells, as well as release her son from his marriage to Margaery, Cersei attempts to frame Margaery for adultery and treason. However, this plot backfires as the investigation into Margaery reveals evidence of Cersei's own adultery and her complicity in Robert's death, resulting in her arrest by the Faith. She sends a letter to Jaime, asking him for help, but he burns her note.\n\nCersei confesses her post-marital affairs (though not her relationship with Jaime), while the more serious charges of regicide and incest are to be settled in a trial by combat. Cersei is punished with a walk of shame, being stripped naked and forced to walk through the capital in full view of the public, nearly breaking down in tears near the end. Confined to the Red Keep awaiting trial, the kingdom is now run by Pycelle and Kevan. However, at the nadir of her fortunes, Varys returns to the capital and murders both Pycelle and Kevan. The book ends with Cersei's fate unknown.\n\nCersei Lannister is played by Lena Headey in the television adaption of the series of books.\n\nIn October 2014, Headey and several other key cast members, all contracted for six seasons of the series, renegotiated their deals to include a potential seventh season and salary increases for seasons five, six, and seven. \"The Hollywood Reporter\" called the raises \"huge\", noting that the deal would make the performers \"among the highest-paid actors on cable TV\". \"Deadline Hollywood\" put the number for season five at \"close to $300,000 an episode\" for each actor, and \"The Hollywood Reporter\" wrote in June 2016 that the performers would each be paid \"upward of $500,000 per episode\" for seasons seven and the potential eight. In 2017, Headey became one of the highest paid actors on television and will earn £2 million per episode for the show.\n\nMuch of Cersei's storyline from the first and second season in the television series is unchanged from the books. A notable change in the show is Joffrey authorising the purge of Robert's bastards, not Cersei.\n\nCersei learns that her husband Robert is in danger of finding out that the children he sees as his heirs to the throne are not his. Robert meets his end as the result of a boar attack on a hunting trip, before Ned Stark tells him of the truth about his children. Cersei works quickly to instate her oldest son, Joffrey, on the throne, with her as his chief political advisor and Queen Regent. Joffrey quits listening to his mother.\n\nTywin decides that Cersei does not exercise enough control over her son, and sends Tyrion as an additional political advisor. Cersei and Tyrion do not get along, and constantly try to undermine each other's authority over the crown. As of the end of season 2, Tyrion has accumulated more sway over the Iron Throne, and has shipped Cersei's only daughter off against Cersei's will to be married to the prince of Dorne.\n\nCersei comes to fear that Margaery intends to usurp her as queen, and unsuccessfully tries to alienate Joffrey from her. Cersei is delighted when Tywin learns of the Tyrells' plan to wed Sansa Stark to Margaery's brother Loras and he intervenes having Tyrion marry Sansa instead, but is furious when Tywin also orders her to marry Loras. When Jaime returns to King's Landing, he immediately seeks out Cersei, who is shocked to discover that his sword hand has been cut off.\n\nCersei has Tyrion arrested after Joffrey is fatally poisoned. It is implied that she knows Tyrion's guilt is highly unlikely, but just wants to see him dead, though Jaime refuses to carry out the order. Indeed, at Tyrion's trial, Cersei has manipulated the entire procedure so that the witnesses give either incomplete or entirely false testimonies to implicate Tyrion and Sansa further in the murder. When Tyrion demands a trial by combat, Cersei quickly chooses Ser Gregor \"The Mountain\" Clegane as her champion to diminish Tyrion's chances of acquittal, and has Bronn betrothed to a noblewoman so that Tyrion cannot choose him as his champion. Cersei's wish comes true when Tyrion's champion, Oberyn Martell, is killed by Clegane, but she still refuses to marry Loras, even threatening her father with revealing the truth about her relationship with Jaime and the parentage of her children. Tywin rebuffs her threats, though he himself is killed by an escaping Tyrion soon afterwards.\n\nCersei receives a threat from Dorne, where Myrcella is betrothed to Trystane Martell, and sends Jaime to Dorne to retrieve her. Tommen is married to Margaery, who tries to manipulate Tommen into sending Cersei to Casterly Rock. Fearful of losing her power, Cersei meets religious leader the High Sparrow, appointing him as the High Septon and giving him authority to re-establish the Faith Militant. In order to destabilise House Tyrell, Cersei arranges for the High Sparrow to arrest Loras for his homosexuality, with Margaery also arrested for perjury after lying to defend Loras. However, Cersei's plot backfires when Lancel, now a member of the Faith Militant, confesses to his affair with Cersei and his role in Robert's assassination, and also accuses Cersei of incest, prompting the High Sparrow to arrest her. Cersei is eventually allowed to return to the Red Keep after confessing to adultery with Lancel, but has her hair cut off and is forced to walk naked through the streets of King's Landing as atonement. Cersei returns distraught by the abuse directed at her by the smallfolk of King's Landing, but is consoled by Qyburn's successful reanimation of Ser Gregor Clegane.\n\nCersei remains in the Red Keep, confined to her chambers and stripped of her authority. Though Cersei accepts Tommen's apology for his lack of action in her arrest and walk of atonement, she remains looked down upon by other members of the court. Cersei learns from Tommen that the High Sparrow plans to have Margaery do a walk of atonement before Cersei's trial and conspires with the Small Council to have the Tyrell army march on the Sept of Baelor to secure Margaery and Loras' release. Their plan backfires when it is revealed that Margaery has joined the Faith of the Seven and has convinced Tommen to merge the Faith and the Crown. Despite being stripped of her allies, Cersei opts to remain in King's Landing, having named Ser Gregor as her champion in her trial by combat. However, Tommen announces that trial by combat has been abolished and replaced by trial by the Seven. Cersei arranges for a cache of wildfire to be detonated beneath the Sept during Loras' trial, killing the High Sparrow, Margaery, Loras, and the rest of the Small Council. As a direct result of Cersei's actions, Tommen commits suicide after witnessing the explosion. With House Baratheon officially extinct (technically speaking, House Baratheon became extinct with the death of Stannis Baratheon) and no one to oppose her in King's Landing, Cersei is crowned Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nDespite nominally being ruler of Westeros, Cersei's grip to power is tenuous, with the Riverlands in upheaval following Arya Stark's massacre of House Frey, the Vale and the North declaring Ned Stark's bastard son Jon Snow King in the North, and Tyrion, Dorne, and the Reach all supporting Daenerys Targaryen, whose fleet has seized Dragonstone. She remains cold and distant in regards to Tommen's suicide, viewing it as a betrayal of their family. With no children left to protect, Cersei's malice and vindictiveness has grown as she relentlessly seeks to expand her power and destroy her enemies. Cersei reaches out to the King of the Iron Islands, Euron Greyjoy, to form an alliance, but rejects Euron's marriage proposal as she considers him untrustworthy. Euron later ambushes Daenerys' fleet and captures Yara Greyjoy, Ellaria and Tyene Sand and presents them as a \"gift\" to Cersei. She agrees to marry Euron after the war is won; however, she continues her affair with Jaime, no longer attempting to hide their relationship from their servants. Cersei imprisons Ellaria and Tyene in the dungeons, poisoning Tyene with the same poison used to kill Myrcella and keeping Ellaria alive to watch her daughter die and rot.\n\nTycho Nestoris of the Iron Bank arrives in King's Landing to request repayment of their debt. Cersei requests a fortnight in order to fulfill their request. She then has the Lannister and Tarly armies attack Highgarden, defeating the Tyrells. Olenna commits suicide following defeat, and gloats to Jaime that she was responsible for poisoning Joffrey. The Tyrell's wealth is transported safely to King's Landing, but the food the Lannisters steal from the Reach is destroyed when Daenerys attacks the caravan with her Dothraki horde and dragon Drogon. Jaime barely survives the battle, and encourages Cersei to consider a ceasefire.\n\nTyrion infiltrates the capital to meet with Jaime, and Jaime tells Cersei that Daenerys and Jon want to meet with Cersei to negotiate an armistice while mankind fights the threat of the White Walkers; Cersei is skeptical, but agrees, and tells Jaime that she is pregnant. Daenerys and Jon meet with Cersei in the Dragonpit on the outskirts of King's Landing, and present to her a wight reanimated by the White Walkers as evidence of their threat. Although terrified, Cersei initially refuses to agree an armistice, as Jon refuses to remain neutral in the war between the Lannisters and Targaryens. Tyrion speaks to Cersei in private, apparently persuading her to ally with the rival monarchs. However, she later reveals to Jaime that she intends for her enemies to wipe out each other before attacking the victor, and has sent Euron to Essos to transport the Golden Company to Westeros. Disgusted by Cersei's selfishness and shortsightedness, Jaime finally abandons her side and goes north on his own, leaving Cersei alone.\n\nCersei has been continuously praised as one of the most complex and multi-faceted characters in either version of the story. \"Rolling Stone\" ranked Cersei at No.5 on a list of the \"Top 40 \"Game of Thrones\" Characters\", describing her as a character who'd \"rather die than give you control\". On a similar list made by \"Rolling Stone\" ranking the \"30 Best \"Game of Thrones\" Villains\", Cersei was ranked No.1, being described as the \"most dangerous human being in Westeros\" as well as \"one of the most complex and fascinating characters on television...she's also a strangely sympathetic figure, warped by being treated like an expensive brood mare by powerful men her entire life and genuine in her affections\". Alyssa Rosenburg of \"The Washington Post\" wrote \"As the men...destroy themselves and each other, leaving a generation of women without husbands, sons, and marriage partners, [Cersei] may be the only [person] left to repair the shattered world\".\n\nLena Headey has received significant critical praise and acclaim for her portrayal of Cersei, and has received multiple accolades including the Portal Award for Best Actress in 2012, the EWwy Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama in 2012, the Women's Image Network Award for Actress Drama Series in 2014,</small> and the Gold Derby TV Award for Best Drama Supporting Actress in 2015 and 2016.\n\nHeadey has received several award nominations for her performance in the series, including four nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2018. She was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Series, Miniseries, or Television Film in 2016. Other nominations include the Portal Award for Best Actress in 2011, the Women's Image Network Awards for Actress Drama Series in 2011, the Golden Nymph Award for Outstanding Actress in a Drama Series in 2012, the Saturn Award for Best Actress on Television in 2012 and 2017, the Gold Derby TV Award Best Drama Supporting Actress in 2012 and 2014, the SFX Awards for Best Actress in 2013, the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress on Television in 2016, the Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2016, and the Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Series, Miniseries or Television Film in 2017.\n"}
{"id": "6966", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6966", "title": "Chinese calendar", "text": "Chinese calendar\n\nThe traditional Chinese calendar (officially known as the Rural Calendar []), or Former Calendar (), Traditional Calendar () or Lunar Calendar (), is a lunisolar calendar which reckons years, months and days according to astronomical phenomena. It is defined by GB/T 33661-2017, \"Calculation and promulgation of the Chinese calendar\", issued by the Standardization Administration of China on May 12, 2017. \n\nAlthough China uses the Gregorian calendar, the traditional Chinese calendar governs holidays (such as the Chinese New Year) in China and in overseas Chinese communities. It lists the dates of traditional Chinese holidays and guides people in selecting auspicious days for weddings, funerals, moving, or starting a business.\n\nLike Chinese characters, variants of this calendar are used in different parts of the Chinese cultural sphere. Korea, Vietnam, and the Ryukyu Islands adopted the calendar, and it evolved into Korean, Vietnamese, and Ryukyuan calendars. The main difference from the traditional Chinese calendar is the use of different meridians, which leads to some astronomical events—and calendar events based on them—falling on different dates. The traditional Japanese calendar also derived from the Chinese calendar (based on a Japanese meridian), but its official use in Japan was abolished in 1873 as part of reforms after the Meiji Restoration. Calendars in Mongolia and Tibet have absorbed elements of the traditional Chinese calendar, but are not direct descendants of it.\n\nDays begin and end at midnight, and months begin on the day of the new moon. Years begin on the second (or third) new moon after the winter solstice. Solar terms govern the beginning and end of each month. Written versions in ancient China included stems and branches of the year and the names of each month, including leap months as needed. Characters indicated whether a month was long (, 30 days) or short (, 29 days); stem branches for the first, eleventh, and 21st days, and the date, stem branch and time of the solar terms.\n\nThe traditional Chinese calendar was developed between 771 and 476 BC, during the Spring and Autumn period of the Eastern Zhou dynasty. Before the Zhou dynasty, solar calendars were used. \n\nOne version of the solar calendar is the five-elements calendar (), which derives from the Wu Xing. A 365-day year was divided into five phases of 73 days, with each phase corresponding to a Wu Xing element. A phase began with a governing-element day (), followed by six 12-day weeks. Each phase consisted of two three-week months, making each year ten months long. Years began on a \"jiǎzǐ\" () day (and a 72-day wood phase), followed by a \"bǐngzǐ\" day () and a 72-day fire phase; a \"wùzǐ\" () day and a 72-day earth phase; a \"gēngzǐ\" () day and a 72-day metal phase, and a \"rénzǐ\" day () followed by a water phase. Other days were tracked using the Yellow River Map (\"He Tu\").\n\nAnother version is a four-quarters calendar (, or ). Weeks were ten days long, with one month consisting of three weeks. A year had 12 months, with a ten-day week intercalated in summer as needed to keep up with the tropical year. The 10 Heavenly Stems and 12 Earthly Branches were used to mark days.\n\nA third version is the balanced calendar (). A year was 365.25 days, and a month was 29.5 days. After every 16th month, a half-month was intercalated. According to oracle bone records, the Shang dynasty calendar ( BC) was a balanced calendar with 12 to 14 months in a year; the month after the winter solstice was \"Zhēngyuè\".\n\nThe first lunisolar calendar was the Zhou calendar (), introduced under the Zhou dynasty. This calendar set the beginning of the year at the day of the new moon before the winter solstice. It also set the \"shàngyuán\" as the winter solstice of a \"dīngsì\" year, making the year it was introduced around 2,758,130.\n\nSeveral competing lunisolar calendars were also introduced, especially by states fighting Zhou control during the Warring States period. The state of Lu issued its own Lu calendar(). Jin issued the Xia calendar () in 102 AD, with a year beginning on the day of the new moon nearest the March equinox. Qin issued the Zhuanxu calendar (), with a year beginning on the day of the new moon nearest the winter solstice. Song's Yin calendar () began its year on the day of the new moon after the winter solstice.\n\nThese calendars are known as the six ancient calendars (), or quarter-remainder calendars, (), since all calculate a year as days long. Months begin on the day of the new moon, and a year has 12 or 13 months. Intercalary months (a 13th month) are added to the end of the year. The Qiang and Dai calendars are modern versions of the Zhuanxu calendar, used by mountain peoples.\n\nAfter Qin Shi Huang unified China under the Qin dynasty in 221 BC, the Qin calendar () was introduced. It followed most of the rules governing the Zhuanxu calendar, but the month order was that of the Xia calendar; the year began with month 10 and ended with month 9, analogous to a Gregorian calendar beginning in October and ending in September. The intercalary month, known as the second \"Jiǔyuè\" (), was placed at the end of the year. The Qin calendar was used into the Han dynasty.\n\nEmperor Wu of Han introduced reforms halfway through his reign. His Taichu Calendar () defined a solar year as days, and the lunar month was days. This calendar introduced the 24 solar terms, dividing the year into 24 equal parts. Solar terms were paired, with the 12 combined periods known as climate terms. \n\nThe Taichu calendar established a framework for traditional calendars, with later calendars adding to the basic formula. The Dàmíng Calendar (), created in the Liang dynasty by Zhu Chongzhi, introduced the equinoxes. The use of a syzygy to determine the lunar month was first described in the Tang dynasty Wùyín Yuán Calendar (). The Yuan dynasty Shòushí calendar () used spherical trigonometry to find the length of the tropical year. The calendar had a 365.2425-day year, identical to the Gregorian calendar.\n\nAlthough the Chinese calendar lost its place as the country's official calendar at the beginning of the 20th century, its use has continued. The Republic of China adopted in 1928, but the change to a single time zone was not been universally adopted in areas such as Taiwan and Hong Kong; some calendars followed the last calendar of the Qing dynasty, published in 1908. This caused confusion about the date of the 1978 Mid-Autumn Festival, and those areas then switched to the UTC+8-based calendar.\n\nDuring the late Ming dynasty, Xu Guangqi and his colleagues worked out a new calendar based on Western astronomical arithmetic; however, the new calendar was not released before the end of the dynasty. In the early Qing dynasty, Johann Adam Schall von Bell submitted the calendar to the Shunzhi Emperor. The Qing government issued it as the Shíxiàn (seasonal) calendar.\n\nIn this calendar, the solar terms are 15° each along the ecliptic and it can be used as a solar calendar. However, the length of the climate term near perihelion is less than 30 days and there may be two mid-climate terms. The Shíxiàn calendar changed the mid-climate-term rule to \"decides the month in sequence, except the intercalary month.\" The present traditional calendar follows the Shíxiàn calendar, except:\n\nTo optimize the Chinese calendar, astronomers have proposed a number of changes. Gao Pingzi (; 1888-1970), a Chinese astronomer who co-founded the Purple Mountain Observatory, proposed that month numbers be calculated before the new moon and solar terms be rounded to the day. Since the intercalary month is determined by the first month without a mid-climate and the mid-climate time varies by time zone, countries which adopted the calendar but calculate with their own time could vary from the time in China.\n\nCalendars of ethnic groups in the mountains and plateaus of southwestern China and the grasslands of northern China are based on their phenology and algorithms of traditional calendars of different periods, particularly the Tang and pre-Qin dynasties.\n\nElements of the traditional Chinese calendar are:\n\nThe Chinese calendar is lunisolar, similar to the Hindu and Hebrew calendars.\n\nThe movements of the sun, moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn (known as the seven luminaries) are the references for calendar calculations. \n\nThe Big Dipper is the celestial compass, and its handle's direction determines the season and month.\nThe stars are divided into Three Enclosures and 28 Mansions according to their location in the sky relative to Ursa Minor, at the centre. Each mansion is named with a character describing the shape of its principal asterism. The Three Enclosures are Purple Forbidden, (), Supreme Palace (), and Heavenly Market. () The eastern mansions are , , , , , , . Southern mansions are , , , , , , . Western mansions are , , , , , , . Northern mansions are , , , , , , .\nThe moon moves through about one lunar mansion per day, so the 28 mansions were also used to count days. In the Tang dynasty, Yuan Tiangang () matched the 28 mansions, seven luminaries and yearly animal signs to yield combinations such as \"horn-wood-flood dragon\" ().\n\nSeveral coding systems are used to avoid ambiguity. The Heavenly Stems is a decimal system. The Earthly Branches, a duodecimal system, mark dual hours (\"shí\", or \"shíchen\" ()) and climatic terms. The 12 characters progress from the first day with the same branch as the month (first \"Yín\" day () of \"Zhēngyuè\"; first \"Mǎo\" day () of \"Èryuè\"), and count the days of the month.\n\nThe stem-branches is a sexagesimal system. The Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches make up 60 stem-branches. The stem-branches mark days and years. The five elements of the Wu Xing are assigned to each of the stems, branches and stem-branches.\n\nChina has used the Western hour-minute-second system to divide the day since the Qing dynasty. Several era-dependent systems had been in use; systems using multiples of twelve and ten were popular, since they could be easily counted and aligned with the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches.\n\nAs early as the Bronze-Age Xia dynasty, days were grouped into nine- or ten-day weeks known as \"xún\" (). Months consisted of three \"xún\". The first 10 days were the \"early xún\" (), the middle 10 the \"mid xún\" (), and the last nine (or 10) days were the \"late xún\" (). Japan adopted this pattern, with 10-day-weeks known as . In Korea, they were known as \"sun\" (,).\n\nThe structure of \"xún\" led to public holidays every five or ten days. During the Han dynasty, officials were legally required to rest every five days (twice a \"xún\", or 5–6 times a month). The name of these breaks became \"huan\" (, \"wash\").\n\nGrouping days into sets of ten is still used today in referring to specific natural events. \"Three Fu\" (), a 29–30-day period which is the hottest of the year, reflects its three-\"xún\" length. After the winter solstice, nine sets of nine days were counted to calculate the end of winter.\n\nThe seven-day week was adopted from the Hellenistic system by the 4th century CE, although its source is unclear. It was again transmitted to China in the 8th century by Manichaeans via Kangju (a Central Asian kingdom near Samarkand), and is the most-used system in modern China.\n\nMonths are defined by the time between new moons, which averages days. Instead of using half-days to balance months with the lunar cycle, every other month of the year has 29 days (short month, ) and the rest have 30 (long month, ). Years start on a long month and alternate. \n\nA 12-month-year using this system has 354 days, which would drift significantly from the tropical year. To fix this, traditional Chinese years have a 13-month year every other year. The 13-month version has the same alternation of long and short months, but adds a 30-day month at the end of the year. Years with 12 months are called common years, and 13-month years are known as long years. \n\nAlthough most of the above rules were used until the Tang dynasty, different eras used different systems to keep lunar and solar years aligned. The synodic month of the Taichu calendar was days long. The 7th-century, Tang-dynasty Wùyín Yuán Calendar was the first to determine month length by synodic month instead of the cycling method. Since then, month lengths have primarily been determined by observation and prediction.\n\nThe days of the month are numbered beginning with 1, and the day number is written with two characters.\nDays one to 10 are written with the day numeral, preceded by the character \"Chū\" (); \"Chūyī\" () is the first day of the month, and \"Chūshí\" () the 10th. Days 11 to 20 are written as numerals; \"Shíwǔ\" () is the 15th day of the month, and \"Èrshí\" () the 20th. Days 21 to 29 are written with the character \"Niàn\" () before the characters one through nine; \"Niànsān\" (), for example, is the 23rd day of the month. Day 30 (as applicable) is written as the numeral \"Sānshí\" ().\n\nHistory books use days of the month numbered with the 60 stem-branches: \n\nBecause astronomical observation determines month length, dates on the calendar correspond to moon phases. The first day of each month is the new moon. On the seventh or eighth day of each month, the first-quarter moon is visible in the afternoon and early evening. In the 15th or 16th day of each month, the full moon is visible all night. On the 22nd or 23rd day of each month, the last-quarter moon is visible late at night and in the morning.\n\nSince the beginning of the month is determined by the new moon occurs, other countries using this calendar use their own time standards to calculate it; this results in deviations. The first new moon in 1968 was at 16:29 UTC on January 29. Since North Vietnam used to calculate their Vietnamese calendar and South Vietnam used (Beijing time) to calculate theirs, North Vietnam began the Tết holiday at January 29 at 23:29 and South Vietnam began it on January 30 at 00:15. The time difference allowed asynchronous attacks in the Tet Offensive.\n\nThe solar year (), the time between winter solstices, is divided into 24 solar terms. Different versions of the traditional calendar might have different average solar-year lengths. One solar year of the 1st century BC Tàichū calendar is (365.25016) days. A solar year of the 13th-century Shòushí calendar is (365.2425) days, identical to the Gregorian calendar. The additional .00766 day from the Tàichū calendar leads to a one-day shift every 130.5 years.\n\nPairs of solar terms are climate terms, or solar months. The first solar term is \"pre-climate\" (), and the second is \"mid-climate\" ().\n\nThere are generally 11 or 12 complete months, plus two incomplete months around the winter solstice, in a solar year. The 11 mid-climates, except for the winter solstice, are in the 11 or 12 complete months. The complete months are numbered from 0 to 10, and the incomplete months are considered the 11th month.\n\nThe first month without a mid-climate is the leap, or intercalary, month. Leap months are numbered with \"rùn\" , the character for \"intercalary\", plus the name of the month they follow. In 2017, the intercalary month after month six was called \"Rùn Liùyuè\", or \"intercalary sixth month\" () and written as \"6i\" or \"6+\". The next intercalary month (in 2020, after month four) will be called \"Rùn Sìyuè\" () and written \"4i\" or \"4+\".\n\nThe lunisolar year begins with the first spring month, \"Zhēngyuè\" (), and ends with the last winter month, \"Làyuè\" (). All other months are named for their number in the month order. If a leap month falls after month 11—as it will in 2033—the 11th month will be \"Shíèryuè\" (), and the leap month will be \"Làyuè\".\n\nYears were traditionally numbered by the reign in ancient China, but this was abolished after the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. For example, the year from February 8, 2016 to January 27, 2017 was a \"Bǐngshēn\" year () of .\n\nDuring the Tang Dynasty, the Earthly Branches were used to mark the months from December 761 to May 762. Over this period, the year began with the winter solstice.\n\nIn China, a person's official age is based on the Gregorian calendar; for traditional use, age is based on the Chinese calendar. At birth, a child is considered one year old; after each Chinese New Year, one year is added to their traditional age. Because of the potential for confusion, infant ages are often given in months instead of years. \n\nAfter the Gregorian calendar's introduction in China, the Chinese traditional age was referred to as the \"nominal age\" () and the Gregorian age was known as the \"real age\" ().\n\nIn ancient China, years were numbered from a new emperor's assumption of the throne or an existing emperor's announcement of a new era name. The first recorded reign title was \"Jiànyuán\" (), from 140 BC; the last reign title was \"Xuāntǒng\" (, from 1908 AD. The era system was abolished in 1912, after which the current or Republican era was used. \n\nThe 60 stem-branches have been used to mark the date since the Shang Dynasty (1600-1046 BC). Astrologers knew that the orbital period of Jupiter is about 4,332 days. Since 4332 is 12 × 361, Jupiter's orbital period was divided into 12 years () of 361 days each. The stem-branches system solved the era system's problem of unequal reign lengths. \n\nNomenclature similar to that of the Christian era has occasionally been used:\nNo reference date is universally accepted. The most popular is the Gregorian calendar ().\n\nOn January 2, 1912, Sun Yat-sen announced changes to the official calendar and era. January 1 was Shíyīyuè 13th, 4609 Huángdì year, assuming a year 0 of 2698 BC. The change was adopted by many overseas Chinese communities, such as San Francisco's Chinatown.\n\nDuring the 17th century, the Jesuits tried to determine the epochal year of the Han calendar. In his \"Sinicae historiae decas prima\" (published in Munich in 1658), Martino Martini (1614–1661) dated the ascension of the Yellow Emperor to 2697 BC and began the Chinese calendar with the reign of Fuxi (which, according to Martini, began in 2952 BC. Philippe Couplet's 1686 \"Chronological table of Chinese monarchs\" (\"Tabula chronologica monarchiae sinicae\") gave the same date for the Yellow Emperor. The Jesuits' dates provoked interest in Europe, where they were used for comparison with Biblical chronology. Modern Chinese chronology has generally accepted Martini's dates, except that it usually places the reign of the Yellow Emperor at 2698 BC and omits his predecessors Fuxi and Shennong as \"too legendary to include\".\n\nPublications began using the estimated birth date of the Yellow Emperor as the first year of the Han calendar in 1903, with newspapers and magazines proposing different dates. The province of Jiangsu counted 1905 as the year 4396 (using a year 0 of 2491 BC), and the newspaper \"Ming Pao\" () reckoned 1905 as 4603 (using a year 0 of 2698 BC). Liu Shipei (, 1884–1919) created the Yellow Emperor Calendar, with year 0 as the birth of the emperor (which he determined as 2711 BC). There is no evidence that this calendar was used before the 20th century. Liu calculated that the 1900 international expedition sent by the Eight-Nation Alliance to suppress the Boxer Rebellion entered Beijing in the 4611th year of the Yellow Emperor.\n\nThe plum-rains season (), the rainy season in late spring and early summer, begins on the first \"bǐng\" day after \"Mangzhong\" () and ends on the first \"wèi\" day after Xiaoshu (). The Three Fu () are three periods of hot weather, counted from the first \"gēng\" day after the summer solstice. The first \"fu\" () is 10 days long. The mid-\"fu\" () is 10 or 20 days long. The last \"fu\" () is 10 days from the first \"gēng\" day after the beginning of autumn. The Shujiu cold days () are the 81 days after the winter solstice (divided into nine sets of nine days), and are considered the coldest days of the year. Each nine-day unit is known by its order in the set, followed by \"nine\" (). \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1784854", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1784854", "title": "Clerical clothing", "text": "Clerical clothing\n\nClerical clothing is non-liturgical clothing worn exclusively by clergy. It is distinct from vestments in that it is not reserved specifically for services. Practices vary: is sometimes worn under vestments, and sometimes as the everyday clothing or street wear of a priest, minister, or other clergy member. In some cases, it can be similar or identical to the habit of a monk or nun.\n\nIn modern times, many Christian clergy have adopted the use of a shirt with a clerical collar.\nIn 1215, the Fourth Lateran Council made it mandatory for all the Christian clergy to wear distinctive dress. Its purpose was not necessarily to elevate the status of the Christian clerics; it was intended that they would catch the public eye if any member of the clergy is seen on the street. However, the rules at the time were not the same as the modern rules, and the rules vary by jurisdiction.\n\n\nIn Rome, Roman Catholic clergy are permitted to wear black, grey, and blue clerical shirts, while in the United States they are permitted to wear only black, quite likely because of long-standing custom and to distinguish them from non-Catholic clergy.\n\nThis applies to the Latin clergy only. Clergy of the Eastern Catholic Churches dress in a similar fashion to local Orthodox clergy.\n\nIn the Eastern Catholic Churches and Eastern Orthodox Churches a useful distinction between liturgical vestments and clerical clothing is that vestments are required to be blessed before being worn. Conversely, clerical clothing is not, and is regarded as daily wear.\n\n\n\nAccording to the 1604 Canons of the Church of England, the clergy were supposed to wear cassock, gown, and cap whilst going about their duties. The cassock was either double or single breasted; buttoned at the neck or shoulder, and was held at the waist with a belt or cincture. The gown could either be of the special clerical shape - open at the front with balloon sleeves - or the gown of the wearer's degree. This was worn with the Canterbury Cap, which gradually stiffened into the familiar 'mortar board' in the course of the 17th and 18th centuries. Cassock and gown were worn as outdoor dress until the beginning of the nineteenth century, with the Canterbury Cap being replaced by the mortar board or tri-corn hat latterly. Increasingly, though, ordinary men's clothing in black, worn with a white shirt and either a black or white cravat, replaced the dress prescribed by the Canons.\n\nIn the 19th century, it was fashionable among gentlemen to wear a detachable collar which was washed and starched separately from the shirt. Initially with the detachable collar, Anglican clergy wore a white cravat, later a white bow tie, with a waistcoat with a standing collar and a loose clerical frock coat resembling a knee length cassock with multiple buttons to waist level. Alternatively they could wear the normal style of gentleman's frock coat and a rabat (See above). In the earlier part of the century, Evangelicals often wore 'swallow tail' coats to distinguish themselves from the High Churchmen who favored the frock coat. This distinction is mentioned as late as 1857 when it is alluded to in Anthony Trollope's 'Barchester Towers.' In the middle of the century Anglican clergymen began turning the collar around backwards, creating the first versions of the \"dog collar\". This form of distinctive dress was seen as a controversial affectation of the High Church party, but as time progressed the collar-turned-backwards became more common, and even survived the demise of detachable collars among the general public. Although the black waistcoat has given way to a black shirt, the collar has become a daily part of clerical costume for most Anglican clergy. However, some Anglican clergy join with ministers of reformed churches in eschewing distinctive clerical costume entirely.. During the 20th century Anglican bishops began wearing purple (officially violet) shirts as a sign of their office. Along with the pectoral cross and episcopal ring, this marks them off from other clergy in appearance. While there is no law among the churches of the Anglican Communion that prevents other members of the clergy from wearing a purple shirt, to do so is generally not considered appropriate.\n\nUntil the Regency period, Anglican clergy regularly wore the cassock in public, after enjoying something of a revival in the mid-20th century, this custom is again less common. The traditional Anglican headwear with the cassock was the Canterbury cap, which is now seldom used. Some Anglo-Catholic clergy still wear the biretta. From the mid-eighteenth century, Bishops and archdeacons traditionally wore a shortened version of the cassock, called an apron (which hung just above the knee), along with breeches and gaiters. The gaiters, buttoned up the side, would cover the trouser leg to a point just below the knee. This form of everyday vesture, common up until the 1960s, is now almost extinct. (This was appropriate for them in the time when some of their travelling would be on horseback but continued into the middle of the 20th century.)\n\nSome Anglican clergy favour a double-breasted cassock (known as a Sarum), often with an external button at chest level on which to hook an academic hood (which is worn as part of the choir habit). However, most Clergy, includingAnglo-Catholic Clergy, choose the single breasted cassock. Like Roman Catholic clergy, some Anglican clergy wear the fascia (known within Anglicanism as a cincture) around the waist, while others prefer a belt. Where extra protection from the elements is needed a cloak may be worn over the cassock.\n\nClergy of the royal peculiars, senior chaplains to the forces, members of the Chapels Royal and Honorary Chaplains to the Queen may wear a scarlet cassock and a special badge (Queen's cypher surmounted by St Edward's crown surrounded by oak and laurel leaves) on their scarf.\n\nIt has been mentioned above that the headcover normally worn with the cassock is the biretta (for Roman Catholics) or the Canterbury Cap (for Anglicans). In the 19th century clergy, like most gentlemen of the time, wore the tall silk (top) hat with their outdoor dress and this remained traditional for bishops and other senior clergy for many years. However many clergy preferred to wear the cappello romano, a distinctive broad brimmed round topped hat resembling a low crowned bowler and this remained popular until the World War I, when it tended to be substituted by the dark or black Homburg style hat worn by many professional men until recently.\n\nLutheran clerical clothing varies depending on locality and denomination. The clerical clothing of Lutheran priests and bishops often mirrors that of Catholic clergy; cassock or clerical shirt and a detachable clerical collar. In Scandinavia Lutheran bishops usually wear a pectoral cross.\n\nDanish clergy will wear a black cassock, as in Anglican and Catholic traditions, but with a distinctive ruff. The ruff is a large collar, stiffly starched, worn over the top of a full clerical collar. Until the 1980s, this used to be the custom in Norway also, and was a relic of the period when Denmark-Norway had shared a common monarchy (1384-1814). In Sweden, a distinctive form of frock coat was worn by the clergy, and is still seen on formal occasions when it is worn with a stand-up collar and short bands.\n\nIn British Methodism, a minister (presbyter) often wears a simple business suit with a coloured shirt and clerical collar. For more formal services a minister will adopt a cassock with bands. For ceremonial and very formal occasions, such as the (British) Remembrance Day service at the Cenotaph in London, a traditional black Geneva preaching gown, academic hood and bands may be worn.\n\nMethodist deacons (male or female) have a less strict dress code; but they often wear dark blue clothing, and always wear the pectoral cross of their religious order.\n\nThe dress of those lay members of the congregation who sing in the choir, and of the organist, varies from congregation to congregation. A typical costume might be a blue cassock, English-style plain white surplice, and for women a canterbury cap.\n\nDress in the United Methodist Church differs from the British norms. There are no official rules on vestments or clerical clothing. Therefore, use of clerical clothing by United Methodist clergy varies greatly by location and situation. Methodist clergy frequently wear clerical clothing on pastoral visits at hospitals and nursing facilities. Elders will most frequently wear black or blue clerical shirts while bishops will wear purple.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3930516", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3930516", "title": "Cultural influence of Star Trek", "text": "Cultural influence of Star Trek\n\n\"Star Trek\" is one of the most culturally-influential media franchises, and is often regarded as the most influential science fiction TV series in history.\n\nThe original series, which aired in the late 1960s, has since spawned six successor series and thirteen movies , merchandise, and a multibillion-dollar industry collectively known as the \"Star Trek\" franchise. The franchise is owned by CBS Television Studios, which now owns television properties previously held by Paramount Pictures, the studio that produced \"Star Trek\" for many decades. CBS Paramount continues to hold DVD rights to the TV series, and the rights to produce feature films.\n\nTwo films, \"Galaxy Quest\" (1999) and \"Free Enterprise\" (1999), and a television series, \"The Orville\", have been inspired by the cultural influence of \"Star Trek\".\n\nGene Roddenberry sold \"\" in 1964 to NBC as a classic adventure drama, calling it a \"Wagon Train to the Stars\". But Roddenberry wanted to tell more sophisticated stories, using futuristic situations as analogies for current problems on Earth and showing how they could be rectified through humanism and optimism. The series' writers frequently addressed moral and social issues such as slavery, warfare, and discrimination. The opening line \"to boldly go where no man has gone before\" is almost verbatim from a U.S. White House booklet on space produced after the \"Sputnik\" flight in 1957.\n\nA major inspiration for \"Star Trek\" was the science fiction film \"Forbidden Planet\", whose influence is especially apparent in the pilot episode \"\" Previous sophisticated science fiction TV series included anthology series such as \"The Twilight Zone\" and the British Quatermass serials, but \"Star Trek\" was the first American science fiction series with a continuing cast that was aimed at adults, telling modern morality tales with complex narratives.\n\nEarlier British science fiction series with marionettes and soap operas had interracial casting, but this was the first American live-action series to do this. At a time when there were few non-white or foreign roles in American television dramas, Roddenberry created a multi-ethnic crew for the Enterprise, including an African woman (Uhura), a Scotsman (Montgomery Scott), an Asian man (Hikaru Sulu), and—most notably—an alien, the half-Vulcan Spock. In the second season, reflecting the contemporaneous Cold War, Roddenberry added a Russian crew member, (Pavel Chekov). The original series is also credited with American television's first interracial kiss, between a white man and an African-American woman, although this had happened earlier in a British medical soap opera, \"Emergency – Ward 10\". Also, the spy series \"I Spy\", featured a scripted, unedited interracial kiss between Robert Culp (white) and France Nuyen (Vietnamese) in the episode \"The Tiger\"; a kiss that would not gain the controversy or attention as the \"Star Trek\" kiss.\n\n\"Star Trek\"s contributions to television history include giving women jobs of respect, most notably through the casting of Nichelle Nichols, a black actress, as Uhura, the ship's communications officer. Black actresses at that time on television were almost always cast as servants. In fact, Whoopi Goldberg recalled that the first time she saw Uhura, she excitedly told her mother: \"Mama, there's a black woman on television and she ain't no maid!\" In an interview, Nichelle Nichols, who played the black female communications officer, said that the day after she told Roddenberry she planned to leave the show, she was at a fund-raiser at the NAACP and was told there was a big fan who wanted to meet her. Nichols said, I thought it was a Trekkie, and so I said, 'Sure.' I looked across the room, and there was Dr. Martin Luther King walking towards me with this big grin on his face. He reached out to me and said, 'Yes, Ms. Nichols, I am your greatest fan.' He said that \"Star Trek\" was the only show that he, and his wife Coretta, would allow their three little children to stay up and watch. [She told King about her plans to leave the series.] I never got to tell him why, because he said, 'You can't. You're part of history.' When she told Roddenberry what King had said, he cried.\n\n\"The Original Series\" has later received some criticism for its portrayal of women, particularly its visual aesthetics. Women's crew uniforms, which consisted of miniskirts, high heeled boots, and heavy makeup, have been pointed-to as degrading to women for highlighting their frequent role as sexual objects. Researchers have pointed out that this was not necessarily the way the wardrobe, or the overall femininity of female characters in the series, was viewed by contemporary female viewers. Cited are the concerns of women of the time period with the perceived upsetting of traditional gender roles for women of the future, with the women of the show's feminine behavior acting to reaffirm that women's sexuality and traditional femininity would not be lost. This fear was manifested by the media's criticisms of Valentina Tereshkova, the first female astronaut to go to space, as masculine and \"mannish\". The uniform's usage of the miniskirt was also considered progressive by some at the time, as the miniskirt, at that time, was a symbol of the modern woman's economic and sexual independence.\n\nComputer engineer and entrepreneur Steve Wozniak credited watching \"Star Trek\" and attending \"Star Trek\" conventions while in his youth as a source of inspiration for him co-founding Apple Inc. in 1976, which would later become the world's largest information technology company by revenue and the world's third-largest mobile phone manufacturer.\n\nThe series gained multiple Emmy Award nominations during its run, but never won. Despite a restricted budget, the series' special effects were superior to contemporary TV series, its stories were often written by prominent science fiction authors (though often re-written by the series' regular writers), and many of its production values—such as costuming and set design—were of high caliber for such a low budget. Some of the production staff of \"The Outer Limits\" worked on \"Star Trek\" and often made creative re-use of props from the earlier series.\n\nDuring its network run from 1966 to 1969, \"TOS\" ratings were mediocre. A letter-writing campaign by fans, unprecedented in size, contributed to NBC's decision to renew the series for a third season, but the network put the series in a disadvantageous timeslot, and \"TOS\" was finally canceled after its third season.\n\nAfter its cancellation, through reruns \"Star Trek\" became more popular and reached a much wider audience than when it had originally aired. Known as \"trekkies\" or \"trekkers\", the series' fans formed clubs and organized conventions. In 1976, following another fan-organized letter-writing campaign, NASA named its first space shuttle orbiter, \"Enterprise\" (OV-101), after the fictional starship.\n\nNASA also employed actress Nichelle Nichols, who played Uhura, to help recruiting African-Americans and women to become astronauts.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, encouraged by the burgeoning fan base for the series, Roddenberry sought to start a second television series (\"\"); this abortive attempt morphed into \"\" in 1979. The movie did sufficiently well at the box office, grossing more than $80 million in the United States and $139 million worldwide, to spawn several more movies during the 1980s. In 1987, Roddenberry created a second television series, \"\" (\"TNG\"), which was set aboard the fifth starship USS \"Enterprise\" (NCC-1701-D) more than seventy years after events in the earlier series and related movies. Unlike \"TOS\"—which often reflected a bold, interventionist American philosophy—\"TNG\" had a less aggressive and more socially liberal message. Unlike its progenitor, this series entered syndicated, rather than a nationwide network, from the beginning, and was sold to individual local television stations. It became the number one syndicated television, lasting seven seasons, spawned two sequels, a prequel, four movies, and a vast marketing franchise.\n\n\"Star Trek\" and its spin-offs have proved highly popular in television repeats, shown repeatedly on television stations in the United States and throughout the world. The \"Star Trek\" franchise is similarly prolific. Only \"Star Wars\" has had as significant an influence as a science fiction and popular culture phenomenon. According to \"Forbes\" magazine:\n\n\n\"Star Trek\" conventions have been popular, but are waning and are now often meshed with conventions of other genres. Fans coined the terms \"Trekkies\" and \"Trekkers\" to describe themselves, and produce an abundance of material like fanzines with fiction, art and songs.\n\nThe series cultural influence goes far beyond its longevity and profitability. An entire subculture grew up around the series and, anecdotally, there are indications that \"Star Trek\" has influenced many people's lives. Many scientists and engineers claim that their professional and life choices were influenced by \"Star Trek\". An article in \"Columbia\" asserted that the starship captains of the \"Star Trek\" franchise are consistently among the best father figures on television, inspiring real fathers to embrace their responsibilities and act with \"selfless authority\". The inventor of the first non-vehicular cell phone, Martin Cooper, states he was motivated to develop it from watching \"Star Trek\". Others have also been inspired by \"Star Trek\" when designing new technology, such as Dr. Peter Jansen, who invented a functional tricorder, and several computer scientists at the University of Illinois, who have created a prototypical version of \"Star Trek\"s famous Holodeck.\n\nThe Harvard Pluralism Project-recognized philosophical society for \"pluralistic rationalism\", The Circle of Reason, notes similarities between its practiced social philosophy and the fictional \"Star Trek\" backstory's Vulcan philosophy of IDIC and logic.\n\nWell-known phrases like \"Beam me up, Scotty\", \"Resistance is futile\" (from the Borg), and Treknobabble have also managed to enter the English vernacular. Beyond this, \"Trekkie\" is the only fan label listed in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", and words from the series including Klingon have also been added to that dictionary.\n\nKlingon has actually spawned a life of its own, going on to garner its own grammar and vocabulary and dedicated speakers from across the globe.\n\nA broad consensus amongst fans is that the \"Star Trek\" franchise became formulaic and mediocre in the 1990s on account of over-exploitation of the franchise by Paramount and production of multiple spin-offs and movies, though fans do not necessarily agree as to when this began (some adult viewers of \"TOS\" felt it also could be formulaic and repetitive). The release in May 2009 of \"Star Trek\", a reboot involving characters from the original series and set in an alternate timeline, was developed with the partial hope to resurrect the franchise.\n\nJeff Jensen of \"Entertainment Weekly\", in reviewing the new film states that the \"Star Trek\" franchise had \"devolved into a near-irrelevant cultural joke, likely to inspire giggles and unprintable curses from even its most ardent supporters.\" Leonard Nimoy wondered in 2003 whether or not the franchise \"had run its course\". Director J. J. Abrams argued \"people [may not] even understand what \"Star Trek\" means anymore\", and joked that a parody like \"Galaxy Quest\" which \"mocks the paradigm\" made the task of producing a credible \"Star Trek\" film that much more challenging. Even on set, Abrams felt nervous \"with all these tattooed faces and pointy ears, bizarre weaponry and Romulan linguists, with dialogue about 'Neutral Zones' and 'Starfleet'\". In covering the relaunch film, Jensen remarked the series' optimistic nature ran counter to an increasingly cynical culture, and that the film had been delayed from December 2008 to May 2009 to \"rehab\" the series' image.\n\nUpon release, the film was a major critical and box office success, sparking comments by fans and critics that the franchise has a bright renewed future.\n\nThe opening fanfare of \"Star Trek: The Original Series\", written by Alexander Courage, is one of the most culturally-recognized musical memes in existence. Also included as the opening fanfare to \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" and the \"Star Trek\" film series, it has come to iconically symbolize \"Star Trek\" to even the casual viewer. Michael Giacchino has written a well-received distinctive new fanfare for the reboot \"Star Trek\" movie and its sequels, \"Star Trek Into Darkness\" and \"Star Trek Beyond\".\n\n\"\" and \"\" received their own distinctive opening fanfares. In a departure from the tradition of sweeping classical themes symbolizing the various incarnations of \"Star Trek\", the opening theme to \"\" is the (pre-existing) pop song \"Faith of the Heart\", by Diane Warren (\"Star Trek: Enterprise\" episodes close with the more-traditionalized \"Archer's Theme\" epilogue, as a consolation to disappointed \"Star Trek\" music fans).\n\nSome of the most prominent composers of 20th- and 21st-century film music have written film scores and television scores for \"Star Trek\". These include Jay Chattaway, Cliff Eidelman, Michael Giacchino, Jerry Goldsmith, James Horner, Dennis McCarthy and Leonard Rosenman.\n\nA subgenre of \"Star Trek\" fandom has developed, specifically for the music of \"Star Trek\", which includes music lovers who are not otherwise interested in \"Star Trek\" fandom. Dozens of commercially produced musical recordings of performances of \"Star Trek\" music exist—unrelated to the performance of screen \"Star Trek\" itself—evidencing the intrinsic cultural value and influence of the music of \"Star Trek\".\n\nA concert series, \"\", by Erich Kunzel and the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra, played in several U.S. and Canadian cities between 2007 and 2010.\n\nThe first television series with comparable storyline and set-up to \"Star Trek\" (aside from the genre rival \"Doctor Who\") was the 1990s series \"Babylon 5\". When pitching the series, the producer J. Michael Straczynski had hoped that television executives would think \"Trek\" had opened up the market for science-fiction on television. However, he was told that \"Star Trek\" only created a market for more \"Star Trek\" and that the prospects for non-Trek related science fiction were seen as bleak. Eventually, \"Babylon 5\" was greenlit. Three script writers who had worked for the original \"Trek\" series were to write for \"Babylon 5\" (including D. C. Fontana who had written for three different \"Trek\" series), and \"Star Trek\" actor Walter Koenig was cast in a recurring role. All this, and the strong similarities of the series' premise to \"\" invited comparison to \"Star Trek\". In addition, \"Babylon 5\" was the first television series since \"Star Trek\" to get nominated for or win the Hugo award for best science fiction drama, which had only recognized feature films in the media category since \"Star Trek\". Gene Roddenberry's widow and \"Star Trek\" actress, Majel Barrett-Roddenberry, publicly stated that her decision to do a guest star appearance on \"Babylon 5\" was to stop the feuding and bickering among hardline fans of the two series, which broke out occasionally at science fiction conventions. Ultimately, the series ran for its intended length of five seasons, making it the longest running American space oriented futuristic television series outside of the \"Star Trek\" franchise.\n\nSome television series feature major or supporting characters whose love of \"Star Trek\" affects the storyline of the series.\n\"The Replacement\", a Season 5 episode of \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\", features two versions of the character Xander, a \"Star Trek\" fan, which is a simultaneous tribute to the \"Star Trek\" episode \"\", in which there are two Captain Kirks.\n\nIn crossover casting, two other television series have cast actors from \"Star Trek\" in series in which other characters are \"Star Trek\" fans who frequently refer to \"Trek\" moments or cite \"Trek\" storylines. The character Hiro Nakamura on NBC's \"Heroes\" likes to describe his ability to teleport as \"like \"Star Trek\"\", and has often performed Mr. Spock's Vulcan salute. His father is played by original \"Star Trek\" cast member George Takei (Sulu). Additionally, Nichelle Nichols, who portrayed Uhura on \"The Original Series\" also appears on the series.\n\nOver a dozen actors from various \"Star Trek\" series have made guest appearances on one or the other of the \"Stargate\" series. In those series, Colonel Jack O'Neill makes unsuccessful pitches to name new space vessels after the \"Enterprise\", and also gives the Vulcan salute in tribute to \"Trek\". In an earlier episode of \"\", O'Neill travels back in time to the 1960s and during an interrogation by an Air Force officer he refers to himself as \"James T. Kirk, captain of the federation starship Enterprise\". Another \"Trek\" reference is made when a character questions whether or not another team member can be \"beamed up\". The response is \"What am I, Scotty\"? Later on the series, advanced alien technology allows team members to \"beam\" up and down in manner similar to that seen on \"Star Trek\".\n\nIn the Cold War submarine film \"Crimson Tide\" (1995), in a moment of crisis, the USS Alabama executive officer (played by Denzel Washington) gives a pep talk to his young radioman, urging him to repair the ship's radio by referring to Kirk's telling Scotty they need \"more power\". The \"Trek\" fandom of Noel, a recurring character on the sitcom \"Frasier\", plays a role in several episodes, including \"Star Mitzvah\", in which he deceives Frasier into believing a speech is written in Hebrew when it is really in the Klingon language.\n\nThe main characters from the sitcom \"The Big Bang Theory\", especially Sheldon Cooper, make various references to and are big fans of \"Star Trek\", with Sheldon even citing Starfleet regulations during an argument in one episode and the main characters dressing up as Data, Worf, Captain Picard and a Borg drone, respectively, in another. Also the series features Wil Wheaton in a recurring role as a fictionalized version of himself plus guest appearances from Brent Spiner and LeVar Burton, and a voice-only cameo from Leonard Nimoy, who voices a Mr. Spock action figure talking to Sheldon in his dreams. There was also an appearance of a Gorn in one episode.\n\nThe Gorn captain's fight to the death with Captain Kirk in the original \"Star Trek\" episode, \"\", was the subject of an episode of the television series \"MythBusters\", in which the viability of Kirk's improvised bamboo cannon was put to the test.\n\n\"Star Trek\" has been the subject of a large number of parodies and tributes.\n\nProminent among film parodies is \"Galaxy Quest\", as it parodied the original \"Star Trek\" series, elements of \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\", and the whole Trekkie phenomenon.\n\nOn television, the animated series \"Futurama\" makes frequent references to \"Star Trek\" and parodies some of its better known plot elements on a regular basis, including the character Zapp Brannigan who is based on a combination of Captain Kirk and William Shatner, and cast members of the original series have taken part in one episode. Prominent examples in other television series include multiple episodes of \"The Simpsons\" and \"Family Guy\". The children's series \"The Backyardigans\" has an episode titled \"Garbage Trek\" that is an homage to the original series. Joss Whedon has cited \"Star Trek\" as being the father of his cult series \"Firefly\" and its film \"Serenity\" (2005).\n\nThe direct-to-video series \"VeggieTales\" features two \"Star Trek\" parodies, including \"The Gourds Must Be Crazy\" (from \"Are You My Neighbor?\") and \"Veggies in Space: The Fennel Frontier\" which serves as a sequel to the other. The character Scooter is based on Montgomery Scott.\n\nThere are many other parodies in comic strips, music and computer games, such as Eminem's song \"We Made You\". In the music video, Eminem was dressed as Mr. Spock and Dr. Dre as Captain Kirk.\n\nIn 1995, MTV's animated series \"Beavis and Butt-Head\" parodied the series with Beavis as Captain Picard and Butt-Head as Commander Riker.\n\nAn entire Finnish parody series \"Star Wreck\" was produced starting in 1992, culminating with \"\" in 2005, all available as legal downloads on the web . \"\" is a fan-made parody of both \"Star Trek\" and \"Babylon 5\".\n\nNASA and other institutions have paid explicit tribute to the series in the use of names of ships and characters from the series. Subtle acknowledgments in media and real life include the use of \"Star Trek\" ships' registry numbers, especially the Enterprise's NCC-1701.\n\nTwo episodes of \"Eek! The Cat\" parodied \"Star Trek\" (with the main character as a Captain Kirk-esque character; one episode featured William Shatner voicing the villain Captain Berserk).\n\nIn August 2010, the members of the Internal Revenue Service created a six-minute \"Star Trek\" themed training video for an agency conference. The video featured a mock set of the \"Enterprise\" in one of the agency's studios. The project cost 62 hours of staff time and cost $3,100. Revealed to the public in 2013, the spoof along with parodies of other media franchises was cited as an example of the misuse of taxpayer funds and \"insulting the beloved sci-fi TV show\".\n\n\"Animaniacs\" has made an obvious parody of \"Star Trek\", calling it \"Star Truck\". Another \"Star Trek\" band, Warp 11, has released several studio albums.\n\nA limited number of Famous Players theatres in Canada house large replicas of the USS \"Enterprise\" (NCC-1701-A). They can be found in the cities of Thunder Bay, Windsor, Ottawa, Winnipeg, and Richmond. In the Greater Toronto Area, replicas can be seen in the Yorkdale Shopping Centre, and in the SilverCity in Richmond Hill.\n\nIn addition, a replica of the Sovereign-class USS \"Enterprise\" (NCC-1701-E) can be found in Laser Planet in Oakville, Ontario as well as in the Colossus theatres, in Langley, British Columbia and Laval, Québec.\n\nThe coincidentally-named Vulcan, Alberta hosts \"Trek\"-related memorabilia and events.\n\nRiverside, Iowa has proclaimed itself the future birthplace of Captain James T. Kirk. Gene Roddenberry, the creator of \"Star Trek\", asserts in the book \"The Making of Star Trek\" by Stephen Whitfield, that the character of Kirk had been born in the state of Iowa. In March 1985, when the town was looking for a theme for its annual town festival, Steve Miller, a member of the Riverside City Council who had read Roddenberry's book, suggested to the council that Riverside should proclaim itself to be the future birthplace of Kirk. Miller's motion passed unanimously. The council later wrote to Roddenberry for his permission to be designated as the official birthplace of Kirk, and Roddenberry agreed. In the 2009 \"Star Trek\" reboot, Riverside is depicted as having a Starfleet shipyard on its outskirts, where the USS \"Enterprise\" (NCC-1701) was built.\n\nThe city of Garland, Texas is the first city known to have an official place name based on the television series: \"Star Trek Lane\", located off of Apollo Road and east of North Jupiter Road ().\n\nThe city of Birmingham, Alabama also boasts a \"Star Trek Lane\" and \"Star Trek Circle\", in the Sunrise East subdivision of its Roebuck neighborhood.\n\nThe unincorporated Sky Parkway area of South Sacramento has a number of space-themed street names, including Klingon Court and Romulan Court.\n\nAn unincorporated area near the Las Vegas Strip contains a residential street named \"Roddenberry Avenue\". While the mailing address lists the avenue as being located in Las Vegas, Nevada, the physical address is an unincorporated township called \"Enterprise\". There is no indication that the township's name has any connection with the \"Star Trek\" series, and it is unknown whether or not the street name is a deliberate tribute to the \"Star Trek\" creator.\n\nTurlock, California has a subdivision with several Trek-themed road names including Picard Lane, Warp Drive, Impulse Lane, Crusher Avenue, and Federation Court.\n\nNorthern Virginia has a few \"Star Trek\"-inspired locations including Warp Drive at the headquarters of local space company Orbital ATK, named such at the request of the company; and the Intelligence and Security Command's Information Dominance Center, whose interior was designed to mimic the bridge of the \"Enterprise\" by a Hollywood set designer. The Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center annex of the National Air and Space Museum occasionally hosts set pieces and movie screenings.\n\nThe series greatly influenced public interest in the U.S. Space Program and in education on the topic of space exploration. \"Star Trek: The Original Series\" ran from 1966 to 1969 benefited from the popularity of the televised Apollo 11 moon landing. The association between \"Star Trek\" and NASA grew stronger over time - the first NASA orbiter shuttle, Space Shuttle \"Enterprise\", was named after the USS \"Enterprise\" of \"Star Trek\" fame. The IXS \"Enterprise\", NASA's conceptual design for a superluminal spacecraft, was similarly named after the USS \"Enterprise\" in 2014.\n\nThis connection remained solid throughout the 1990s, when many of the cast members began narrating documentaries about the franchise's content and space exploration. Some of these documentaries were produced in cooperation with NASA itself, most notably the IMAX title \"Destiny in Space\" (1994), narrated by Leonard Nimoy. In 2013, NASA produced a 30-second ad to accompany the theatrical release of \"Star Trek Into Darkness\" in an effort to bolster support for its space program.\n\nIn addition, NASA has named a number of asteroids after people or elements connected to the \"Star Trek\" franchise: \n\n"}

Plainly stated, enrollment management is an organizational concept and a systematic set of activities designed to enable educational institutions to exert more influence over their student enrollments. \n\nSuch practices often include marketing, admission policies, retention programs, and financial aid awarding. Strategies and tactics are informed by collection, analysis, and use of data to project successful outcomes. Activities that produce measurable improvements in yields are continued and/or expanded, while those activities that do not are discontinued or restructured. Competitive efforts to recruit students is a common emphasis of enrollment managers.\n\nThe numbers of universities and colleges instituting offices of \"enrollment management\" have increased in recent years. These offices serve to provide direction and coordination of efforts of multiple offices such as admissions, financial aid, registration, and other student services. Often these offices are part of an enrollment management division.\n\nSome of the typical aims of enrollment management include:\n\n\nAccording to Matthew Quirk :\n\nEnrollment Management Blog\n"}

The approach is conventionally understood as having been developed by Franz Boas who developed the discipline of anthropology in the United States. A 2013 re-assessment of the evidence has indicated that the idea of four-field anthropology has a more complex 19th-century history in Europe and North America.\n\nFor Boas, the four field approach was motivated by his holistic approach to the study of human behavior, which included integrated analytical attention to culture history, material culture, anatomy and population history, customs and social organization, folklore, grammar and language use. For most of the 20th century, U.S. Anthropology departments housed anthropologists specializing in all of the four branches, but with the increasing professionalization and specialization, elements such as linguistics and archaeology came to be regarded largely as separate disciplines. Today, physical anthropologists often collaborate more closely with biology and medicine than with cultural anthropology.\n"}

Also referred to as gender-sensitive budgeting, this practice does not entail dividing budgets for women. It aims at dealing with budgetary gender inequality issues, including gender hierarchies and the discrepancies between women's and men's salaries. Gender budgeting allows governments to promote equality through fiscal policies by taking analyses of a budget's differing impacts on the sexes as well as setting goals or targets for equality and allocating funds to support those goals.\n\nThree principal activities have been recognized as gender budgeting sensitive:\nPoint 3 most likely includes the restructuration of the existing budget to deal with gender-related issues.\n\nGender budget analysis aims at finding out whether women and men have can access the same opportunities equally. In gender budget analysis, gaps are addressed so that those who are disadvantaged become empowered. A gender-sensitive budget analysis contains how budgets recognize and answer the needs of men and women, whether they are children, young or adults. Gender budget analysis plays a key role in highlighting discrimination against women and how money is distributed between two groups. This type of analysis contributes to finding solutions to gender discrimination and highlights empowerment or disempowerment among two distinct groups: men and women.\n"}

It has similarities with other languages of the Zaza-Gorani subgroup of the Northwestern Iranian languages. Gorani is most similar to languages like Zazaki, Shabaki, Bajelani and Sarli.\n\nGorani or Hawrami is spoken in the southwestern corner of province of Kurdistan and northwestern corner of province of Kermanshah in Iran, and in parts of the Halabja region in Iraqi Kurdistan and the Hawraman mountains between Iran and Iraqi Kurdistan.\nThe oldest literary documents in these related languages, or dialects, are written in Gorani.\n\nMany Gorani speakers belong to the religious grouping Yarsanism, with a large number of religious documents written in Gorani.\n\nGorani was once an important literary language in the parts of Western Iran but has since been replaced by Sorani. In the 19th century, Gorani as a language was slowly replaced by Sorani in several cities, both in Iran and Iraq. Today, Sorani is the primary language spoken in cities including Kirkuk, Meriwan, and Halabja, which are still considered part of the greater Goran region.\n\nKurds and Gorani speakers themselves tend to consider Gorani as a dialect of Kurdish group of languages, which diverged off from Kurmanji speakers, Badhini and Sorani alike, at around 100 BCE. The differences between the Zaza–Gorani languages and the Kurdish languages are too many, and are therefore far too great by any standard linguistic criteria to warrant classification as dialects of the same languages.\n\nThe name Goran appears to be of Indo-Iranian origin. The name may be derived from the old Avestan word, \"gairi\", which means mountain. The word Gorani refers to inhabitants of the mountains or highlanders as the suffix \"-i\" means \"from\". The word has been used to describe mountainous regions and the regions' communities in modern Kurdish literary texts. In this sense Gorani has the same etymological background as the Gorani language spoken in the Balkans, which derives from a Slavic word 'gora' also meaning mountainous region. \n\nThe name Horami is believed by some scholars to be derived from God's name in Avestan, Ahura Mazda.\n\nUnder the independent rulers of Ardalan (9th–14th / 14th–19th century), with their capital latterly at Sanandaj, Gorani became the vehicle of a considerable corpus of poetry. Gorani was and remains the first language of the scriptures of the Ahl-e Haqq sect, or Yarsanism, centered on Gahvara. Prose works, in contrast, are hardly known. The structure of Gorani verse is very simple and monotonous. It consists almost entirely of stanzas of two rhyming half-verses of ten syllables each, with no regard to the quantity of syllables.\n\nAn example:\nدیمای حمد ذات جهان آفرین\n\n\"After praise of the Being who created the world\n\nیا وام پی تعریف شای خاور زمین\n\nI have reached a description of the King of the Land of the East.\n\nNames of forty classical poets writing in Gurani are known, but the details of the lives and dates are unknown for the most part. Perhaps the earliest writer is Mala Parisha, author of a masnavi of 500 lines on the Shi'ite faith who is reported to have lived around 1398–99. Other poets are known from the 17th–19th centuries and include Mahzuni, Shaikh Mostafa Takhti, Khana Qubadi, Yusuf Zaka, and Ahmab Beg Komashi. One of the last great poets to complete a book of poems (divan) in Gurani is Mala Abd-al Rahm of Tawa-Goz south of Halabja.\n\nThere exist also a dozen or more long epic or romantic masnavis, mostly translated by anonymous writers from Persian literature including: Bijan and Manijeh, Khurshid-i Khawar, Khosrow and Shirin, Layla and Majnun, Shirin and Farhad, Haft Khwan-i Rostam and Sultan Jumjuma. Manuscripts of these works are currently preserved in the national libraries of Berlin, London, and Paris.\n\nSome Gorani literary works:\n\nHawrami (هەورامی; \"Hewramî\") also known as Avromani, Awromani or Owrami, is one of the main groups of dialects of the Gorani language, and is regarded as the most archaic of the Gorani group. It is mostly spoken in the Hawraman region, a mountainous region located in western Iran (Iranian Kurdistan) and northeastern Iraq (Iraqi Kurdistan). The key cities of this region are Pawe in Iran and Halabja in Iraq. Hawrami is sometimes called Auramani or Horami by people foreign to the region.\n\nThere are also large communities of people of Ahl-e Haqq in some regions of Iranian Azerbaijan. The town of Ilkhichi (İlxıçı), which is located 87 km south west of Tabriz is almost entirely populated by Yâresânis. But they are ethnically Turks. Groups with similar beliefs also exist in Iranian Kurdistan. Both the Dersim \"(Zazaki)\" people and the Gorani people, adhere to a form of \"Yazdanism. \"These people are called under the various names, such as Ali-Ilahis and Ahl-e Haqq. Groups with similar beliefs also exist in all parts of Kurdistan.\n\n\n\n"}

The Syriac term \"Hagraye\" can be roughly translated as \"the followers or descendants of Hagar\", while the other frequent name, \"Mhaggraye\", is thought to have connections with the Arabic \"Muhajir\", other scholars assume that the terms may not be of Christian origin. Patricia Crone and Michael Cook claim in their book \"Hagarism: The Making of the Islamic World\" was introduced by the Muslims themselves who described their military advance into the Levant and Jerusalem in particular as a Hijra.\n\nThe name, used interchangeably with Ishmaelites, came also to mean any Muslim. An example of its current usage is \"Ahryani\" (Aхряни), a name used for Bulgarian Muslims in colloquial Bulgarian - although this term has also been explained as paralleling the spread of Balkan Islam with anti-trinitarian Arianism.\n\n"}

{"id": "31542027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31542027", "title": "Malay folklore", "text": "Malay folklore\n\nMalay folklore refers to a series of knowledge, traditions and taboos that have been passed down through many generations in oral, written and symbolic forms among the indigenous populations of Maritime Southeast Asia (Nusantara). They include among others, themes and subject matter related to the indigenous knowledge of the ethnic Malays and related ethnic groups within the region.\n\nThe stories within this system of lore often incorporate supernatural entities and magical creatures which form parts of the Malay mythology. Others relate to creation myths and place naming legends that are often inter-twined with historical figures and events. Ancient rituals for healing and traditional medicine as well as complex philosophies regarding health and disease can also be found.\n\nThe oral forms of this lore are transmitted primarily through nursery rhymes, folksongs, theatrical exhibitions, and stories that are commonly told from parent to child. Nomadic storytellers that would roam the temples, marketplaces and palace courts also play a large part in the insemination of the oral traditions throughout the populace, often accompanied by music as well through forms of composed poetry and prose. The oral traditions are often integrated with moral values and some may also include stories of talking animals.\n\nOf all the types of oral transmission, those in the form of music appear to be most pervasive in Malay society. Songs and melodies from times of old are sung and resung on a regular basis during festivities such as weddings, celebrations of motherhood and childbirth, rites of passage and at cultural or religious celebrations. They are also utilized in the occasional ceremonial functions in royal weddings, in rites of ascension (or coronation) and royal birthday celebrations; in the form of the more refined court music.\n\nEvery region or each of the states may employ different versions of oral transmission but the most popular is in the form of folk-singing or \"lagu rakyat\". The Middle Eastern-influenced \"ghazal\" can be heard in the southern Malaysian state of Johor especially is the district of Muar. Poets and singers consisting of often females and sometimes males vocalize popular love poems and riddles in the form of pantun to the accompaniment of a composition and of music made for a six-stringed Arabian lute (see oud), Indian tablas, Western violins, accordion and marracas.\n\nForms of nursery rhymes and lullabies are also sung at weddings and cultural festivals in the state of Melaka by Malays and the Malay-speaking Peranakan communities. The contents of the songs are mostly to do with advise on love, life and marriage and are affectionately known in Malay as \"dondang sayang\" meaning \"song of love\".\n\nWithin each of these folk-songs, messages and stories are told, a kind of informal handing down of wisdom from the old to the young in the form of poetry which may include any of these:\n\nThe Malay oral tradition includes a large collection of folksongs. Many of these songs are in the form of stories weaved into poetry or simple rhyme. These folksongs continue to be sung and a sizable number of them are included in the albums of modern-day singers, often with improvisations in terms of melody and more complex musical arrangements to suit a larger accompaniment of musicians as well as singers.\nAmong the more well known Malay folksongs include:\n\nA number of these folksongs originally belong to a certain region within Southeast Asia and are sung by the populations within the area. However, due to the nature of inter-mingling and mutual co-migrations within these areas the folksongs may also be heard in places far from their original geographic origins.\n\nStories of love and romance of princes and princesses, kings and queens, and heroes and their damsels in distress (and often, damsels and their heroes in distress) have long filled the imaginations of ethnic Malays. The fact that numerous royal courts existed and still exist in Southeast Asia supplied the basis of the stories. Although many of these tales are replete with additions (or reductions) and may contain a certain measure of exaggeration as well as the expected variations that existed from one story teller to another, the value and the wisdom behind each story cannot be ignored.\n\nThese stories are often told by professional story tellers called \"penglipur lara\", which roughly translates to \"reliever of sorrows\". The few \"penglipur lara\" that exist today are often farmers or at least rural villagers. In the past, travelling \"penglipur lara\" would carry the stories from one \"kampung\" (village) to another, making the occasional stops at marketplaces, village squares as well as royal courts. The essence of the stories remain the same but sometimes, adjustments are made according to the individual story-teller's preference. For example, the \"penglipur lara\" version of the Ramayana changes many of the names and settings and casts Laksmana as a \"pawang\" or Malay shaman, as opposed to the literary Hikayat Seri Rama or the theatrical Hikayat Maharaja Wana which remained closer to the original Indian epic.\n\nAmong the well known stories that may fall into this category includes the following:\n\nMany of these stories are also condensed and made into poetic songs. A fixed melody is set for each story to the extent that if a melody is played or sung in the absence of its wordings, a Malay would be able to instantly recall the title of the story or at least the name of the characters in the story.\n\nAnimal fables are often used to explain certain natural phenomena. Other times, they are simple moral tales. In almost all instances, the animals in these stories possess the ability to speak, reason and think like humans, similar to Aesop's Fables.\n\nThe \"kancil\" or mouse-deer serves as the main character in a number of the stories. The Malays regard this humble animal in the highest esteem due to its ability to overcome obstacles and defeat adversaries despite of its rather small and benign appearance. The mouse-deer appears in the state herald of Melaka and even plays a part in the legend of Malacca's founding.\n\nBelow are listed some of the common fables as well as their approximate title translations. (Note that the word \"sang\", an Old Malay honorific meaning \"revered\", appears in all instances preceding the name \"kancil\" to indicate respect)\n\nMalays, as with other Southeast Asians, have always taken great interest in stories of ghosts and spirits. It must be stressed that due to the animistic root of Malay folklore, these ghosts are seen as sharing the plane of existence with humans and are not always considered evil. However, when the delicate line that separates the boundaries of existence is crossed, or a transgression of living spaces occurs, a conflict ensues that may result in disturbances such as possessions.\n\nThe Malay word for ghost is \"hantu\". However, this word also covers all sorts of demons, goblins and undead creatures and are thought to have real physical bodies, instead of just apparitions or spectres. The most famous of these is the \"pontianak\" or \"matianak\", the ghost of a female stillborn child which lures men in the form of a beautiful woman.\n\nBelow are listed other popular supernatural beings and ghosts as well as their descriptions.\n\nMalay folklore that appear as written traditions are often called \"hikayat\", \"kisah\" or \"dongeng\". The oldest of them were written in Old Malay using the prevailing scripts of the time, such as Sanskrit, Pallava or Kawi. From around the 14th century onward, they were written in Classical Malay using Jawi script which prevailed ever since the arrival of Islam until the colonial era. During this time, the Malay royal courts became the centre for learning where scribes record the genealogy of kings and queens as well as historical events.\n\nThe \"hikayat\" or epics are collections of stories and legends of heroism that often involve mythological and historical figures in a setting usually engaging the role of protagonists and antagonists. The Hikayat Hang Tuah and the story of Hang Jebat are among the most well known \"hikayat\" which are often told and retold in various forms such children's books, films, theatre plays and musical productions. The choice of who were to be portrayed as the protagonists and who were to be portrayed as the antagonists usually lies with the alignment of the storyteller, although most commonly, bards tend to maintain a stance of neutrality and dispassion in their story telling. In the stories of Hang Tuah and Hang Jebat for example, the lawful Hang Tuah may be portrayed as the hero, while sometimes, the non-lawful Hang Jebat may assume that role.\nOther notable \"hikayat\" include:\n\n\"Kisah dongeng\" are a loose collection of bedtime stories, fables and myths that involves human or non-human characters, often with superhuman powers along with talking animals, and an unearthly setting.\n\nIn this category, the story of \"Puteri Gunung Ledang\", \"Bawang Putih Bawang Merah\" and \"Batu Belah Batu Bertangkup\" is well known by the Malays. All three have been made into movies, albeit with differing interpretations and settings.\n\nCharacters with human-likeness abound in these stories. They are collectively referred to as \"orang halus\" meaning the \"refined folk\" or \"soft folk\" (often erroneously translated as \"elves\"). Most are invisible to the average human.\n\n\n\n\n\nLater folk stories adopted elements from the Islamic world, of Middle Eastern and Persian origin but having arrived by way of Muslims from India. They differ somewhat from their Arabian counterparts due to the fact that what Malays now refer to as angels or demons were originally animistic spirits and deities.\n\n\nApart from the stories and songs, Malay folklore also includes traditions, rituals and taboos related to the physical as well as the more metaphysical realms of the Malay world view. Such knowledge are usually presented in the forms of symbols and signs inscribed or built into temple walls, palaces, houses and often appear on stone inscriptions as well as grave markers. Natural symbolism are also important such as flowers, trees, animals, the sea as well as celestial objects such as the moon and stars. Malays also have knowledge of a series of constellations that are markedly different from the Indian system upon which it is based. Object symbolism such as wood carvings of animals, ancestral images, mythical beings and masks are also common in Malay society.\n\nSymbolic forms of folklore are usually the domains of the spirits and are therefore sometimes employed by the traditional healers and shamans. The Malays have been known to employ supernatural forces for healing as well as in the aiding of child-birth, the curing of poisons and in the warding off of spirits. Due to the Islamization movement of recent decades, these practices are not very well-documented in Malay, but have been recorded in some Western sources.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "680321", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=680321", "title": "Martin (TV series)", "text": "Martin (TV series)\n\nMartin is an American sitcom that aired for five seasons on Fox from August 27, 1992, to May 1, 1997. Reflecting the rising popularity of the Fox network throughout the 1990s, \"Martin\" was one of the network's highest-rated shows during the sitcom's run.\n\nSet in Detroit, Michigan the series stars Martin Lawrence in the role of Martin Payne, a disc jockey with a girlfriend named Gina Waters (Tisha Campbell-Martin). Martin works for the fictional radio station WZUP and later for local Public-access television station Channel 51. A common theme of the series is Martin's selfish and free-spirited nature. Episodes often center on Martin's inappropriate behaviors and incessant smart mouth towards his friends, neighbors, and whoever else finds themselves in his presence. When all is said and done, however, Martin loves his family and friends—it just takes dire situations for him to show it.\n\nAs the series progressed, plotlines saw Martin eventually move on to become the host of the talk show \"Word on the Street\", which aired on the small Detroit public-access television station Channel 51. He retained this position until the series' final episode, in which he and Gina prepared to move to Los Angeles, from where his show would be syndicated nationally. The move coincided fortuitously with Gina's promotion by her boss Mr. Whitaker to head up his company's new Los Angeles headquarters, after having shut down the Detroit office. Gina's best friend Pam, whom Whitaker let go two episodes earlier due to this consolidation and downsizing, went on to pursue a career in the music industry as an artists & repertoire (A&R), executive at Keep It Real Records. (This plotline is the subject of a backdoor pilot episode that was included in the \"Martin\" series for a planned sitcom on Fox starring Tichina Arnold to be called \"Goin' for Mine\" (Episode 129, \"Goin' for Mine\"). This sitcom never materialized, however.) And at series' end, Cole proposed to his even more dimwitted, but attractive and devoted girlfriend Shanise (portrayed by Maura McDade), and they made plans to move into their own place. The only actor to appear in every episode as the same character is Thomas Mikal Ford as Tommy.\n\nIn early episodes, Lawrence began with a monologue of him speaking directly to the camera and audience from the darkened radio studio.\n\nIn 1997, Tisha Campbell filed a lawsuit against her co-star Martin Lawrence and the show's producers for sexual harassment and verbal and physical assaults, and she did not appear in most of the season five episodes. The explanation in most of the episodes Campbell did not appear in was that Gina was \"out on business\", though in the two-part episode \"Going Overboard\" it was stated that Gina had arrived too late to board the boat for the trip alongside everyone else. HBO Studios eventually settled the case with Campbell so that the show's last season could be completed. Campbell did return to the Martin set to film the two-part series finale of the show under the condition that she would not share any scenes with or interact in any way with Martin Lawrence. In the episode, Martin and Gina kept entering and exiting the sets at different times and the storyline was adjusted so that the characters were both part of it but never crossed paths.\n\n\n\n\nOne of the trademark running gags of \"Martin\", especially early in its run, was Lawrence playing multiple characters, utilizing various costumes and prosthetic appliances. This was often done as a plot device or comic relief. Season four was the last season to feature Lawrence as multiple characters on a regular basis. This technique was rarely used in Season 5, which was the final season of the series. The only characters that appeared in Season 5 were Sheneneh, Roscoe and Elroy. Mama Payne does not appear but her voice is heard in the holiday episode \"Scrooge\". Most of the other characters were last seen in Season 4 and the episodes they last appeared in seemingly wrote them out of the series.\n\nReruns have been seen in first run syndication in the past. Reruns began airing on MTV2 on February 21, 2011. As of October 2015, reruns of Martin now air on BET and as of 2018, VH1.\n\nHBO Home Video has released all five seasons of \"Martin\" on DVD in Region 1.\n\nIn January 2018, rumors have circulated that the popular series was possibly slated for a reboot due to a post that Martin Lawrence's fiance teased on Instagram, which made viral headlines to a popular blog The Shade Room. She posted a picture of the Martin TV show title card logo with the caption: \"Got word from my fiance that my favorite TV show may be coming back\" ending the comment with the peeking wide eyes emoji and Martin replied to the post with the same emoji, which can insinuate a common nod towards each other. \"HipHollywood\", another internet entertainment media blog, questioned Tisha Campbell-Martin on the rumor during an interview, in which she gave a ecstatic response that she can't speak upon it stating \"It has been an honor to be Gina all these years and its surprising that people still love those characters so much. So, i can't tell you guys anything, but it is very excitng\". Adding insult to injury, a few days later during an E! News Daily Pop interview, she was caught off guard by the host who asked her about it, and instead of answering it, she jokingly denied it and brushed it off by changing the subject. Her responses caused an immediate interest from all media outlets to believing that she confirmed a possible reboot.\n\nEarly February, TMZ caught up with Tichina Arnold, Tisha Campbell-Martin and Martin Lawrence altogether leaving Morton's Steakhouse in Burbank, California, all smiles and anticipating the same question. Martin replied by saying \"Never Say Never\", Tichina added by stating \"\"In life there's always new beginnings, and there's always change...so we'll see what's happening\".\" Tisha ended it bluntly and jokingly by blurting out \"We can't tell y'all shit, how 'bout that\", The interview continues to go more in depth about questioning the shows popularity from the past and how a reboot can be made up to date with current events and hold its' popularity if it's greenlighted. Tichina and Tisha's responses kind of hinted and gave it away that it may happen, but realizes the questions already pushed them to reveal their answer, in which Tisha ends it with the same blunt quote she stated earlier in the interview. The interview is also the first time Tisha and Martin is seen publicly together since their past cast debacle, which was part of the reason for the show's cancellation in 1997.\n\n"}
{"id": "17250167", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17250167", "title": "Movement in learning", "text": "Movement in learning\n\nMovement in learning or movement-based instruction is a teaching method based on the concept that humans learn better through movement. This teaching method can be applied to students, who should have the opportunity throughout a class period to move around to take \"brain breaks\" to refocus their attention so they can learn new material. Brain research suggests that physical activity prior to class (in PE for example) and during class, increases students' ability to process and retain new material. This is a new and controversial development in education, and, to date, has little research and empirical data to support this trend. However, anecdotal evidence regarding the benefits of incorporating movement in the classroom is promising. \n\nPhysical movement stimulates long-term memory and recall because it has been associated in the human brain with survival and this is supported by brain imaging studies. This is confirmed by findings such as the studies that show exercise shapes muscles along with the strengthening of some areas of the brain, growing brain cells and increases alertness in the process. It is said that the harder the task is for students, the greater the cerebellar activity. Specifically, short movement breaks for the brain is said to lead to more opportunities for information processing and increased memory formation. It contributes to the overall cognitive development of the students because it sends oxygen, water, and glucose to the brain, helping it grow and improve mood and motivation. In addition, the area of the brain that processes movement is also the part that processes cognitive tasks. The link between movement and the cognitive development has been proven as early as the 1960s during Richard Held and Alan Hein's experiments that revealed the role of physical activity on the development of brain networks that are important for adaptive mental function. \n\nStudents through brain breaks to engage in physical activities can facilitate physical development. In combination with the socialization, which also contributes to the learners' socio-emotional development - movements offer a quick and convenient way to support the rapid development, especially among young learners. This can be demonstrated in the efficacy of using physical tasks to address the needs of hyperactive students because they release stress and energy, allowing them to focus on their studies without causing disruption in the class. Movements also eliminate lethargy that results from sitting for long periods of time. There are recorded cases, for instance, that show marked improvement in school performance for learners who were made to do physical tasks such as walking in mid-afternoon. \n\nIdeally students should be getting physical activity before they try to learn new material. However, if it is not possible for students to have physical activity before a lecture, there are many ways to get students out of their seats and moving during a class period. Students can get out of their seats to turn an assignment in or to pick up a handout. You could have students stand up to share their answers to questions posed by the teacher. After they have shared their answers with each other they may sit down. If students are acting tired and drowsy a teacher could give students a quick break to stand up and stretch. Once they get out of their seats and move around for a bit they will act more alert. Students that struggle to stay focused or are seen as disruptive can benefit greatly from movement in the classroom.\n\nYounger students can benefit from a variety of activities that get them moving and also reinforce what they are learning. Brain based learning supports the use of movement in learning. According to the University of Wisconsin at Stevens Point, a core principal of brain-based learning states, \"Learning engages the whole body. All learning is mind-body: movement, foods, attention cycles, and chemicals modulate learning.\" Another core principal states, \"Complex learning is enhanced by challenge and inhibited by stress. Another state,\"Enrichment: The brain can grow new connections at any age. Challenging, complex experiences with appropriate feedback are best. Cognitive skills develop better with music and motor skills. (Dï Arcangelo)\" The U.S. National Institute of Health as well as the Mayo Clinic list exercise and movement as a way to decrease stress levels. Elementary aged children can only absorb 15 to 20 minutes worth of material at a time. Taking brain breaks is a win-win situation. Students can learn during these brain breaks plus return to a task renewed and energized.\n\nAlso try Drums Alive Academic Beats for ideas that will help in science, and math lessons.\n\nSimple movements can have the ability to improve cognition in just seconds (Krock & Hartung, 1992) \nChart: Sample movements and classroom applications\n\nMany special-needs learners are stuck in counterproductive mental states, and movement is a quick way to change them, movements, such as those involved in playing active games, will activate the brain across a wide variety of areas. A study by Reynolds and colleagues (2003) found that children with dyslexia were helped by a movement program. Those in the intervention group showed significantly greater improvement in dexterity, reading, verbal fluency, and semantic fluency than did the control group. The exercising group also made substantial gains on national standardized tests of reading, writing, and comprehension in comparison with students in the previous year.\n\n\n\n\"This article is based on an earlier version originally posted at WikEd and reposted here by the author.\"\n"}

You Devil is a 1984 American comedy film starring George Burns, Ted Wass, Ron Silver and Roxanne Hart. Directed by Paul Bogart and produced by Robert M. Sherman. The screenplay is by Andrew Bergman. \"Oh, God! You Devil\" is the third and final installment in the \"Oh, God!\" film series following \"Oh, God!\" (1977) and \"Oh, God! Book II\" (1980), based on the novel of the same title by Avery Corman.\n\nGeorge Burns received a Saturn Award nomination for Best Actor for his performance.\n\nBurns plays the dual roles of both God and the devil. The devil—Harry O. Tophet—(Tophet is a Hebrew word for \"Hell\") is a lively character, taking pleasure in petty acts of PG-rated malice, such as making a waiter fall into a pool.\n\nThe movie tells the story of a struggling rock musician/songwriter, Bobby Shelton (played by Wass), who cannot get a break. Bobby, desperate to support his wife, Wendy (Roxanne Hart), and start a family, muses that he would sell his soul to the devil to get ahead. The devil begins to appear to Bobby as a prospective agent called Harry O. Tophet and offers Shelton a deal—seven years of unprecedented fame and fortune. Shelton balks at the deal and so Tophet renegotiates claiming that it will be for a \"trial period,\" urging Bobby to leave his earnest agent Charlie (Eugene Roche). Shelton signs the document, but his signature transforms into that of established rock star Billy Wayne (Robert Desiderio), the last person to whom Tophet offered this deal, and soon after Bobby realizes he has sold his soul to the devil.\n\nShelton discovers that, though he now has the big success he wanted after a mammoth concert tour, he has lost his identity—he is now Billy Wayne. As such, his family is now someone else's--the former Billy Wayne, whose life Tophet now controls and who has assumed Bobby's identity. He also discovers that his wife is pregnant with his child. Realizing that he is trapped, Bobby asks for help from God, who has been watching over him, finally succeeding when, as Billy Wayne, he travels to Las Vegas for important shows. God appears after Bobby has \"the Lord\" paged in a hotel lobby and offers to help.\n\nDuring a climactic poker game between God and the devil over Bobby's soul, God raises the stakes while Bobby as Billy attempts suicide. God claims he will stop protecting all those on \"his list\" in exchange for Bobby's soul (meanwhile, Bobby, under Tophet's machinations, is about to kill himself). If God wins, the devil would be prevented from meddling with any of those on the list, even if they beg for his assistance. Considering the loss too high, Tophet folds, and finds that God had been bluffing and that part of the reason he had intervened for Bobby was because the devil had become too arrogant and cocky.\n\nBobby rises from the floor of the dressing room and slips away as staffers discover the corpse of Billy Wayne, who had committed suicide. In the end, God meets with Bobby and tells him about how his father once prayed for him when he was a sick child, and that since then, God has kept his eye on him. After warning Bobby that next time he will not bail him out, Shelton returns to happiness in a simple life with his loving wife and daughter. Years later, his daughter becomes ill and Bobby says the same prayer that his father did. The movie ends with Bobby, God, and the spirit of Bobby's father singing to his daughter the same song Bobby's father used to sing to him, \"Fugue for Tinhorns\" from the musical \"Guys and Dolls\".\n\n\nAfter the success of \"Oh God!\" Warner Bros. approached other writers for sequels. They commissioned Josh Greenfield to write one and Andrew Bergman another. Bergman rewrote a play he had on his shelf about a songwriter who sells his soul to the devil. \"Not a good play, but it was there sitting on my shelf,\" he says. \"For me it was just an attempt to salvage something that I thought was a cute idea and was going nowhere. Also, I wanted to work with George Burns. This to me was linking up with a previous era of comedy... George was just the most fantastic person. He's so smart. Every single thing he said was funny.\"\n\nBased on eleven reviews, the film has a 36% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n"}

Directed by Mary Lambert and written by King, the film features Dale Midkiff as Louis Creed, Denise Crosby as Rachel Creed, Blaze Berdahl as Ellie Creed, Miko Hughes as Gage Creed, and Fred Gwynne as Jud Crandall. Andrew Hubatsek was cast for Zelda's role. King, who scripted from his own book, also has a cameo as a minister.\n\nA sequel, \"Pet Sematary Two\", was met with less financial and critical success. An upcoming second film adaptation of the same name is scheduled for release in 2019.\n\nThe Creed family—Louis, Rachel, and their children Ellie and Gage—move from Chicago to rural Ludlow, Maine, after Louis is offered a job as a doctor with the University of Maine. They befriend their elderly neighbor Jud Crandall, who takes them to an isolated pet cemetery (misspelled \"sematary\") in the forest behind the Creeds' new home.\n\nOn his first day at work, Louis meets Victor Pascow, a jogger who is brought in with severe injuries from a car accident. He warns Louis about the pet cemetery before he dies, calling Louis by name despite the fact they have not previously met. After he dies, Pascow comes to Louis in the night and leads him to the Pet Sematary, warning him not to cross the barrier because the ground beyond is \"sour\". Louis awakens assuming it was a dream, but notices his feet are covered in dirt.\n\nDuring Thanksgiving while the family is gone, Ellie's cat, Church, is run down on the highway in front of the house. Realizing that Ellie will be devastated, Jud takes Louis beyond the cemetery and deep into the woods, where they reach an abandoned Micmac burial ground. Without explanation Jud instructs Louis to bury the cat and warns him not to tell anyone else about what they have done. The next day Church comes back to life, though a shell of what he was before; he stinks, moves sluggishly, and is vicious towards Louis. Jud explains that he himself revived his beloved pet dog in the Micmac ground as a boy, and that although the cat might be different, it will save Ellie the grief of losing her favorite pet.\n\nSometime later, Gage is killed by a truck along the same highway. The family is devastated, and Jud anticipates that Louis is considering burying his son in the Micmac ground, although Louis denies it. Jud believes that introducing Louis to the ritual ground aroused the malevolent forces present there, which caused Gage's death.\n\nHe tells him the story of a local named Bill Baterman who buried his son Timmy in the Micmac ground after he was killed in World War II. Timmy returned as a malevolent zombie, terrifying the townsfolk. A group of men including Jud tried destroying Timmy by lighting the Baterman house on fire, only for the deranged Bill to perish with his son. Jud insists that the burial ground is evil and Louis must never try to bury his son there.\n\nAfter the funeral, Rachel and Ellie leave for Chicago while Louis remains home. Despite Pascow and Jud's warnings, Louis exhumes his son's body and buries him at the ritual site. In Chicago, Pascow appears to Ellie in a dream and warns her that Louis is about to do something terrible. Rachel is unnerved by her daughter's dream, but is only able to reach Jud when she calls, who tells her Louis is not home. She decides to return to Maine, much to Jud's alarm.\n\nThat night, Gage returns home and steals a scalpel from his father's bag. He taunts Jud before slashing his Achilles tendon and throat, killing him. Rachel returns home and is lured into Jud's house by the voice and specter of her dead sister Zelda, only to discover that she is actually seeing Gage, holding a scalpel. In shock and disbelief, Rachel reaches down to hug her son and he kills her.\n\nWaking up from his sleep, Louis notices Gage's muddy footprints in the house and discovers that his scalpel is missing. Receiving a phone call from Gage that he has \"played\" with Jud and Mommy, he fills three syringes with morphine and heads to Jud's house. Encountering Church, he kills the cat with an injection before entering the house. Gage taunts him further and Louis is startled by Rachel's corpse falling hanged from the attic before he is attacked by his son.\n\nAfter a brief battle, Louis kills Gage with the morphine injection. He then lights the house on fire, leaving it to burn as he carries Rachel's body from the fire. Pascow appears and warns Louis not to \"make it worse\" but Louis, now grief-stricken to the point of insanity, believes that because Rachel was not dead as long as Gage was, burying her \"will work this time\". Pascow cries out in frustration and vanishes as Louis passes through him.\n\nThat night, the horribly mutilated Rachel returns to Louis and the couple embrace. Rachel takes a large knife from the counter; Louis screams as the screen cuts to black.\n\nThe film rights were sold to George A. Romero in 1984 for $10,000. King had previously declined several other offers for a film adaptation. Romero eventually had to pull out of the production, as he was busy with \"Monkey Shines\". As stipulated by King when selling the rights to Paramount, \"Pet Sematary\" was shot in Maine where the story was set. The house used for the Creeds' home is a private residence near Hancock, while Jud's house across the street was actually a facade constructed around an existing house that was insulated with fireproof material so that the mock-up could be burned around it. The approach to the Micmac burial ground was filmed at an abandoned granite quarry on Mount Desert Island in Acadia National Park, while a hilltop near Sedgwick was the site of the Micmac ground itself. Other locations included a forest near Ellsworth for the pet sematary, the hospital of the University of Maine at Orono, and Mount Hope Cemetery in Bangor for the graveyard scenes. \n\nInitially, Paramount executives wanted a pair of twins to play the role of Gage, like those chosen to play Ellie, which was the more cost-effective option. However, Lambert was very impressed with three-year old Miko Hughes, whom she felt was a natural talent despite his young age, so she lobbied the studio to accept her choice. She also cast Andrew Hubatsek in the role of Zelda, because she felt having a grown man playing the role of a teenage girl deformed by spinal meningitis made the character more frightening. \n\n\"Pet Sematary\" was director Mary Lambert's second feature film. She was better known for her work directing music videos, especially those for Madonna including \"Like a Prayer\" and \"Material Girl\". Through her work in the music industry Lambert was friends with the Ramones, who were one of Stephen King's favorite bands. She approached them about recording a song for the film and they agreed to write and perform \"Pet Sematary\", which is featured in the closing credits.\n\nThe original cut of the film delivered to Paramount's executives was judged to be too long, so excess footage had to be removed. They also decided that the closing scene was too tame and at their request it was re-shot to be more graphic.\n\nThe film's score was written by Elliot Goldenthal. The film features two songs by the Ramones, one of Stephen King's favourite bands: \"Sheena Is a Punk Rocker\" appears in a scene, and \"Pet Sematary\", a new track written specially for the movie, plays over the credits.\n\nThe song \"Pet Sematary\" became one of the Ramones' biggest charting hits, reaching number four on \"Billboard\"s \"Modern Rock Tracks\" list, despite being, in the words of AMG, \"reviled by most of the band's hardcore fans\".\n\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote that the film \"defied the critics and opened at blockbuster levels\".\nThe film grossed $57 million in North America. Released in 1989 by Paramount Home Video, \"Pet Sematary\" was a best-selling video. Paramount released it on DVD in 2006 and on Blu-ray in 2012.\n\nRotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 50% of 28 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review, and the average rating was 5.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"\"Pet Sematary\" is a bruising horror flick that wears its quirks on its sleeves, to the detriment of its scare factor.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 38 out of 100 based on 12 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". \"Variety\" called it \"undead schlock dulled by a slasher-film mentality\". Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" wrote that the film \"has some effectively ghoulish moments\" but \"fails mostly because it doesn't trust the audience to do any of the work\". Kevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote, \"Lambert goes for strong, succinct images and never stops to worry whether there's a lack of credibility or motivation.\" Richard Harrington of \"The Washington Post\" called it \"bland, clichéd, cheap\". Harrington criticized Gage's actions as disturbing and the climax as \"an ugly payoff to an inept setup\". Bloody Disgusting rated it 4.5/5 stars and wrote, \"The plot alone would make for a scary movie, but by injecting excellent atmosphere, capable acting and generally nightmarish scenes, \"Pet Sematary\" is a truly effective horror flick and well worth the price of admission.\" At Dread Central, Steve Barton rated it 4/5 stars and called it one of the best King adaptations; Jason Jenkins rated it 3.5/5 stars and called it \"one of the better King adaptations of the period\".\n\nA sequel, \"Pet Sematary Two\", was released in 1992 to poor reviews and a disappointing box office. Although it references the events of the first film, the sequel focused on all-new characters. \"Pet Sematary\" has acquired a cult following in recent years, and members of the cast occasionally appear at horror conventions to discuss it. \n\nIn 2002, New York horrorcore rapper Cage wrote the song \"Ballad of Worms\" which was featured on the album \"Eastern Conference All Stars II\" for the independent hip-hop label Eastern Conference Records. Before thought to be about his relationship and struggle with the hip-hop community, he later revealed it was a love song dedicated to the \"Pet Sematary\" character Zelda. \n\nA documentary, \"Unearthed & Untold: The Path to Pet Sematary\", premiered in September 2014, and was released in January 2017. \n\n\"Pet Sematary\" was ranked #16 on IFC's list of the best Stephen King film and television adaptations, and also placed at 16 on \"Rolling Stone\"s Top 30 King adaptations.\n\nThere has been intermittent buzz about a possible adaptation of \"Pet Sematary\", but as of 2017 none has been commissioned. Juan Carlos Fresnadillo was announced as directing the adaptation in October 2013. \n\nIn August 2017, the brother-sister team behind the 2017 adaptation of Stephen King's \"It\", Andrés and Barbara Muschietti, told the \"Toronto Sun\" that they hoped to adapt \"Pet Sematary\" after the sequel of \"It\".\n\nAfter years of rumored reboots of \"Pet Sematary\", Paramount Pictures announced in December 2017 that it was remaking the film with Jeff Buhler penning the script and Kevin Kolsch and Dennis Widmyer set to direct. The new movie stars Jason Clarke and Amy Seimetz as Louis and Rachel Creed, with John Lithgow appearing as Jud Crandall. The movie began filming in Montreal, Canada in June 2018 and is set to be released on April 5th 2019.\n\n"}
{"id": "4091204", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4091204", "title": "Phryne Fisher", "text": "Phryne Fisher\n\nPhryne Fisher ( ), often called \"Miss Fisher\", is the main character in Australian author Kerry Greenwood's series of Phryne Fisher detective novels. Phryne is a wealthy aristocrat and private detective who lives in St Kilda, Melbourne, in the late 1920s. With the assistance of her maid Dot, and Bert and Cec (who are wharfies, taxi drivers and \"red raggers\" (Australian slang of that period meaning communists), she solves all manner of crimes. As a crime fiction character, she has been called a \"quintessentially Australian\" construction. Phryne is no ordinary aristocrat, as she can fly a plane, drives her own car (a Hispano-Suiza) and sometimes wears trousers. However, while displaying bohemian panache, she manages also to maintain style and class.\n\nPhryne was accidentally named after a famous Greek courtesan who lived in the 4th century BC. At her christening, her father forgot the classical name, Psyche, that her parents had intended for her.\n\nPhryne is described in the first of Kerry Greenwood's books, \"Cocaine Blues\", as being named after the courtesan Phryne, after her father forgot her chosen name of Psyche at the christening.\n\nPhryne was not always rich, having been born into a poor family in Collingwood, Melbourne. Her childhood was one of deep poverty, and she occasionally had to scavenge for food in the pig-bins in Victoria Market; she often ate rabbit and cabbage because there was no other food available. In \"Cocaine Blues\", she tells her maidservant and secretary Dot that during her youth she \"starved like Billy-o\" and that her sister died of diphtheria and starvation.\n\nIn World War I, the other male heirs to a British peerage were killed, and Phryne's father inherited the title. In the book Blood and Circuses her father is described as an earl, but in the TV series her father is a baron. As his daughter, she was granted the style of \"The Honourable Phryne Fisher\" and an enormous fortune. She has an aunt, Mrs. Prudence Stanley. She is also described as having sisters and a brother, it is not clear how many sisters she has but her younger sister died of diphtheria.\n\nAfter completing school, Phryne ran away to France where she joined a French women's ambulance unit during WWI, receiving a reward for bravery and a French war pension. She then worked as an artist's model in Montparnasse after the war. Following her time in France, Phryne travelled widely, and has disclosed that she has, amongst other places, visited Florence and spent a night in a Turkish prison (for unknown reasons).\n\nPhryne Fisher's career as a detective is described in \"Cocaine Blues\" as having had its origins in an incident that took place at her family's estate in England. At an evening ball, a diamond necklace belonging to one of the guests disappeared, and Phryne was able, through observing the guests and the room, to quickly identify the person responsible for the theft as Bobby, a young cricket-playing aristocrat.\n\nImpressed by her skills, another guest at the party, a retired Colonel Harper and his wife, Mrs. Harper, engaged Phryne to travel to Australia, her country of birth, and find out if his daughter, Lydia Andrews, was being treated well by her husband, John Andrews. This set in motion the events described in the first of Kerry Greenwood's books on Phryne Fisher, \"Cocaine Blues\". Phryne's motivation to take up private detection as a career is rooted, at least initially, in boredom with the activities of high society in England. Although she did previously engage in charitable works, Phryne noted that \"the company of the Charitable Ladies was not good for her temper.\"\n\nIn \"Flying Too High\", Phryne Fisher decides to settle down in Melbourne, buying a house at 221B, The Esplanade, and moving in there with Dot Williams, her maid. She also engages Mr. and Mrs. Butler to act as her butler and housekeeper, respectively. Phryne confesses to her friend Bunji Ross that she bought the house because it was numbered 221 and that she added 'B' in an obvious reference to the home of Sherlock Holmes at 221B Baker Street.\n\nThrough the course of the books, Phryne collects a personal maid, Dot; two adoptive daughters, Ruth and Jane (whom she rescued from slavery); a cat, Ember; a dog, Molly; and two loyal servants, the Butlers. She also has relationships with a string of lovers, most notably Lin Chung, a wealthy Chinese man (whom she rescues in the city one evening). Lin is the only lover with whom she maintains a relationship for more than a few books and even goes so far as to make a deal with his autocratic and overbearing grandmother that after he is married, she (Phryne) be allowed to continue a relationship with him.\n\nPhryne is described in \"Cocaine Blues\" as having a 'short black cap of hair' which is very straight, and cut to leave the nape of her neck and most of her forehead uncovered. She has grey-green eyes. In \"Flying Too High\", she is described by an acquaintance as being 'small, thin, with black hair cut in what I am told is a bob, disconcerting grey-green eyes and porcelain skin. Looks like a Dutch doll.\" – a description that Phryne herself agrees with.\n\nPhryne can shoot, and frequently carries, and uses, a lady's handgun in her purse. She is frequently described as being possessed of great courage and fearlessness, and personally admits to having very few actual fears (one of them being head-lice, which she abhors). She rarely cries, noting in \"Cocaine Blues\" that the last time she had done so was over a book of poetry by Wilfred Owen, after being sickened by the deaths in World War I.\n\nPhryne is a skilled and experienced pilot, and in \"Flying Too High\", performs a number of dangerous and skilful flying maneouvres in a Gipsy Moth plane in response to a flying instructor's doubts about her skills. She has also flown Dr. Elizabeth Macmillan, her friend and a surgeon, through dangerous conditions to provide medical assistance to those who needed it. In addition to planes, Phryne is a skilled, if somewhat reckless driver, and drives a red Hispano-Suiza, one of her prized possessions.\n\nShe is fond of dancing and has learned to dance the tango from 'the most expensive gigolo on the Rue de Chat-qui-Peche' in Paris. She speaks French fluently, with a Parisian accent and peppered with 'indelicate apache idioms'.\n\nPhryne is described as being fond of the luxuries her position and wealth afford her, while always being conscious of her impoverished origins. She tells the Princess de Grasse in \"Cocaine Blues\" that \"there is nothing like being really poor to make you relish being really wealthy.\" She often carries cash on her person, reasoning that she is unused enough to wealth to want the security of having readily available funds. She is generous with her money, and tips well.\n\nPhryne is frequently described as dressing in high fashion and her clothes are often described in great and elaborate detail. She occasionally dresses in trousers and men's shirts. Phryne also enjoys good food. She is 'devoted' to lobster mayonnaise with cucumbers, in particular. Despite her numerous relationships and conduct that some parts of society might find shocking, Phryne describes herself as being immune to blackmail, showing no alarm, for instance, when Bobby Matthews, a thief she had once caught, threatens to tell all of Melbourne that she had once visited an expensive gigolo in Paris.\n\nAlthough Phryne has had several relationships with men, she is described as being disinclined to settle down and marry. She is described in her books as using a diaphragm sold by Dr. Marie Stopes to avoid unwanted pregnancies. She is described as being heterosexual, and often politely rebuffs advances from women who are attracted to her.\n\nIn \"Cocaine Blues\", for instance she is the subject of the attentions of both Sasha De Lisse and his twin sister Ellie, but tells Sasha that she would prefer him over her, in general. She also declines an unstated offer from a woman attending to her at the Turkish Baths in Melbourne, and notes that she had visited several bars frequented by lesbian and bisexual women in the company of her friend and gigolo, Georges Santin, in Paris. Phryne notes that she \"had little leaning towards homosexuality but she had liked the lesbian bars. They were free of the domination of men, creating their own society.\"\n\nPhryne's relationship with her family can occasionally be strained. In \"Cocaine Blues\", after a theft of jewelry belonging to a guest at a dinner party hosted by the Fishers, Phryne's father and mother engage in a vocal altercation, a situation that Phryne describes as 'normal'. On her arrival in Melbourne, she is initially embarrassed to discover that her father had left a number of unpaid debts of honour there, including one to the local MP, Mr. Sanderson.\n\nPhryne once describes herself as having 'not the faintest spurt of maternity' and demonstrates a disinclination towards young children.\n\nDorothy Williams, known as 'Dot' is Phryne's confidential maid and social secretary. Phryne meets Dot soon after her arrival in Melbourne, while taking a walk through the city. Dot, possessed of a knife, had been trying to find and kill her former employer's son, who had repeatedly harassed and molested her and had her fired when she resisted his advances. Phryne convinces Dot to hand over the knife and gives her food to eat, and then secures Dot's revenge by using the knife to surreptitiously cut through her persecutor's braces, thus disrobing and publicly embarrassing him. Phryne then offers Dot a job as her personal maid and secretary, which Dot accepts. Dot is described as being a very devout Catholic and is very neat with a particular talent for delicate mending and sewing work. She is close to her family and her mother, in particularly, whom she visits frequently.\n\nCecil Yates, known as 'Cec' and Albert Johnson, known as 'Bert' together run and operate a taxi cab in Melbourne, Australia. Phryne Fisher first meets them when her ship docks at Melbourne, and they transport her luggage as well as Dr. Elizabeth Macmillan's to their respective hotels. Cec is described as being tall and blonde-haired, with brown eyes and a taciturn, quiet manner. Bert, on the other hand, is short, darker and older than Cec, as well as more voluble. Cec and Bert are both described as 'red-raggers' i.e. Communists. Cec, in particular, is a gifted navigator with a keen memory for the streets of Melbourne, and is also described as having a soft spot for any animal or person in trouble. Cec and Bert eventually join Phryne as investigative assistants. Phryne Fisher pays them enough money to enable them to buy a new taxi to replace their old one.\n\nPhryne's adopted daughters.\n\nOne of Jack's policemen and Dot's husband-to-be.\n\nPhryne's butler and cook. Mr and Mrs. Butler initially planned to retire after working for a long period of time, but were persuaded out of retirement by Phryne Fisher's generous offer of employment as well as her request that they maintain the confidentiality of her work as a private detective. In Flying Too High, they are known by the names 'Ted' and 'Else'\n\nDr. Elizabeth Macmillan is a Scottish surgeon who works at the Queen Victoria Hospital for Women in Melbourne, Australia. She is a friend of Phryne's. Dr. Macmillan and Phryne reunited during Phryne's voyage by ship from England to Australia in \"Cocaine Blues\". Dr. Macmillan is described as being of around forty-five years of age, with a broad, strong physique, rough and calloused hands, and a weatherbeaten complexion. Her black hair, now turning white, is cut into a 'short Eton crop' and she tends to dress in men's clothes for convenience. Phryne and Dr. Macmillan first meet when there is a 'flu epidemic at a remote island, and Phyrne steps in to fly Dr. Macmillan in on a plane despite dangerous weather conditions. She then assists Dr. Macmillan in attending to the unwell residents of the island, including slaughtering a Highland cow to make them broth.\n\nJillian Henderson is a lawyer and a friend of Phryne Fisher's. She frequently represents clients referred to her by Phryne, and has inherited her practice from her father, who was partner in a firm called Henderson, Jones, and Mayhew.\n\nPhryne Fisher first meets Detective Inspector Jack Robinson while investigating a cocaine ring in \"Cocaine Blues\", and becomes friends with him thereafter. He respects her skills and intelligence, and the two frequently collaborate on criminal investigations. He is described in \"Murder on the Ballarat Train\" as being a \"private man with a doting family, who grew grevilleas and rare native orchids in his yard.\"\n\nWoman Police Constable Jones works for Detective Inspector Jack Robinson and is one of the few women in the police force. She frequently acts as a bait and decoy in investigations and has won a medal for Gallantry for baiting and capturing a suspect in a string of rapes.\n\n\n\"Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries\" is a television costume drama series based on the novels, starring Essie Davis in the title role. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation and Every Cloud Productions produced the series of thirteen one-hour episodes, the first series of which premiered on ABC1 on 24 February 2012.\n\nA second series of 13 episodes followed, a third series of 8 episodes has been released The first episode aired on 8 May 2015, and the season wrapped up with Episode 8 on 26 June 2015.\n\nThe series has been well awarded:\n\n\nA stand-alone action-adventure feature film, \"Miss Fisher and the Crypt of Tears\" will pick up the story from the end of the third series. It began production in October of 2018. The film is budgeted at $8 million and will be directed by Tony Tilse. \n\nSince 2016, there has been speculation on the possibility that the television series would be made into a feature film. In May 2016, Essie Davis acknowledged interest in playing Miss Fisher in a film. \"[We’re] just working out the ideas of how to make it bigger and better and more fabulous than the TV show,\" she said. Later that year, it was revealed that plans were afoot to produce a trilogy of Phryne Fisher films. \n\nIn April 2017, a photo was published on the official \"Miss Fisher Murder Mysteries\" Instagram account showing Essie Davis and Nathan Page holding advance copies of a film script titled \"Miss Fisher and the Crypt of Tears\". On 14 September 2017, a crowdfunding campaign was launched on Kickstarter in support of the film. On 15 December 2017, an additional ongoing crowdfunding campaign was begun through IndieGoGo in order to allow fans to continue supporting the effort. The original campaign reached its goal of $250,000 in less than 48 hours. \n\n"}

{"id": "12374528", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12374528", "title": "Prototype (video game)", "text": "Prototype (video game)\n\nPrototype (stylized as [PROTOTYPE]) is an open world action-adventure video game developed by Radical Entertainment and published by Activision. The game was released in North America on June 9, 2009 (PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360), in southwestern parts of North America (Microsoft Windows) as well as Oceania on June 10, and in Europe on June 12. Versions for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One were released on July 14, 2015 alongside the sequel as \"Prototype Biohazard Bundle\". Separate versions of the games became available in August 2015.\n\nSet in Manhattan, the game follows a powerful amnesiac shapeshifter named Alex Mercer who must stop an outbreak of Blacklight, a plague that mutates individuals into hideous violent monsters. During his quest, Alex tries to uncover his past while also coming into conflict with both the US military and a black operations force called Blackwatch. Parallel to the game's storyline is the ability to play the game as a sandbox-style video game giving the player freedom to roam Manhattan.\n\nThe game was a critical and commercial success, with critics praising the game for its originality and engaging gameplay. Many reviewers compared and contrasted it with \"Infamous\", another open world action-adventure game released one month prior to \"Prototype\". A sequel, \"Prototype 2\", was released in April 2012.\n\nAlex's primary superpower is his ability to shapeshift, changing his body into anyone. Going hand-in-hand with this power is his ability to \"consume\" others, absorbing them entirely. This process allows Alex to quickly regain health by absorbing the biomass of his enemies. This also allows him to take on the forms of the human enemies he absorbs, thereby allowing the player to move about the enemy as one of them. The disguise will only last as long as Alex remains inconspicuous. Alex has incredible physical strength, and will kill most humans in a single punch. He can perform various melee attacks without shapeshifting, as well as more gymnastic moves such as air combos, sliding along the ground using any humanoid enemy's body, and a high-speed rolling cannonball attack.\n\nAlex can also transform parts of his body into a selection of martial implements acquired over the course of the game, either as purchased upgrades or being given them. Offensive powers include the large and powerful Blade arm, fast razor-sharp Claws (which can also erupt large spikes from the ground), the telescoping Whipfist, Musclemass that augments his strength, and the slow but powerful Hammerfists. Defensive options consist of a large shield on Alex's left arm for blocking ballistic attacks that needs to regenerate after excessive damage, and full body armor that exchanges agility and speed for toughness in hand-to-hand combat; both will allow Alex to plow through most obstacles when active. Vision modes include thermal vision, which allows Alex to see enemies through smoke and other obstacles at the expense of a decreased vision range, and Infected vision, which highlights those infected with the BLACKLIGHT virus as well as military units. Both vision modes muffle all of Alex's other senses, such as hearing, in order to concentrate on his sight. One defensive and offensive power may be active at a time, and using either will negate Alex's current disguise. In addition to his own abilities, Alex can take the weapons from defeated or absorbed enemies. These include automatic rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers and missile launchers. He can also seize control of military vehicles, such as tanks and helicopters.\n\nAlex's most powerful attacks are the Devastators, which require Alex to be in Critical Mass- either a state of near-death or the exact opposite, having excess stored biomass and increased health. These include the Tendril Barrage, which fires impaling tendrils from his body in all directions, the Groundspike Graveyard, which erupts massive spikes from the ground all around Alex, and the Critical Pain, which fires a single beam of hardened biomass from his hands to severely damage a single target.\n\nFor movement around the city, Alex uses his increased physical abilities. When sprinting, he will automatically hop over cars, barriers and other obstacles without losing momentum. Alex will also scale any wall he comes into contact with and simply knock aside any humanoids that get in his way without stopping. He can jump great heights and distances, enough to clear five-story buildings, and can sprint at extreme speed indefinitely. Falls cause no damage to the player even from the greatest heights. Even small jumps are enough for Alex to dent the ground beneath him, and falls from sufficient heights will create shockwaves at the point of impact which will kill most humans nearby and send objects as large as cars flying. Falling height also factors into several of Alex's melee attacks.\n\nEnemies in the game are the Infected: those infected with the BLACKLIGHT virus, and the Military. The Infected consist of ordinary civilians infected with the virus that are generally not a threat to Alex. However, the Hunters, huge creatures created from Infected water towers, are one of the main enemies in the game. Evolved Hunters referred to as Leaders are one of the most powerful creatures in the game and are incredibly hard for Alex to kill. The Military consist of ordinary soldiers which are usually not a threat to Alex, although they are capable of operating weaponry that is extremely dangerous to Alex, such as tanks and heavily armed helicopters. The Military also consists of BLACKWATCH, an agency dedicated to combating biological and nuclear warfare. BLACKWATCH is one of the intricate parts of the game's story and create some of the most deadly biological weaponry to combat Alex, including viral detectors capable of detecting Alex even in his disguise, and, introduced later in the game, the deadly poison Bloodtox, capable of slowly killing Alex and the Infected. Introduced later in the game are heavily armored and durable soldiers referred to as Super Soldiers, capable of fighting against Alex and some of the strongest Infected.\n\nIn order to gain more advanced upgrades, Alex is capable of sneaking into Military Bases using a disguise and stealthily consume various officials within the base. He can also set off an alert within the base, in which the only way to escape is to slaughter whoever is in the base. Alex can also gain upgrades from the Infected by collecting genetic data. Infected Hives, like Military Bases, are located all over the city, and produce genetic data constantly. Alex can destroy the Infected Hives or simply absorb the data on the outside as it is being produced. At the start of the game, only small factions of the Infected and Military are present in the city. However, as the game progresses, the Military and the Infected begin to expand. Territory in the city is made out of three distinct zones. Blue Zones are in Military control and are relatively clean of the Infection. Red Zones thrive with the Infection, although there still remains a strong Military presence. In some areas of the city, a Blue Zone and a Red Zone might converge, creating a new and distinct Purple Zone. In these Zones, the Military and the Infected are in a constant battle for control. How the player decides to act in these Zones determine which faction seizes the territory.\n\nThe game takes place in a medium-sized version of Manhattan with all its famous landmarks, including the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, the Trump Building, the One Chase Manhattan Plaza, the Conde Nast Building, the Metlife Building, the One New York Plaza, and the New York Life Building, among others.\n\nThe game follows Alexander J. \"Alex\" Mercer (voiced by Barry Pepper) who wakes up in a morgue in the basement of Gentek, a genetic engineering company based in Manhattan, sending a pair of scientists that were just about to perform an autopsy running. Alex escapes, and witnesses the scientists being gunned down by military operatives. Alex is discovered and attacked. He survives bullets being fired into his chest, and leaps over a wall to safety. He soon discovers he now possesses powerful shapeshifting abilities, superhuman strength, speed, agility, durability, senses, endurance, weaponry and the ability to \"consume\" people to gain their memories, skills and appearance. With no memory of his previous life, Alex decides to find and consume those related to the conspiracy in order to uncover the truth. During his quest, Alex faces two factions: the United States Marine Corps and Blackwatch, a Fort Detrick special forces unit dedicated to combating biological warfare; and the Infected, monsters created by a virus known as BLACKLIGHT that is overrunning Manhattan. Captain Robert Cross (voiced by Jeffrey Pierce), a Blackwatch officer, is given orders to find and contain Alex.\n\nAlex makes contact with his sister, Dana (voiced by Lake Bell), who assists him in tracking down targets, leading to the infiltration of Gentek headquarters. He finds a young woman called Elizabeth Greene contained in the building. Greene is a host for BLACKLIGHT, and upon her escape unleashes it upon Manhattan. Dana directs Alex to Karen Parker, his ex-girlfriend. She agrees to aid him in stopping the virus, while requiring Alex to bring back samples of the virus. Karen later leads Alex into a trap, where he is confronted by Cross. During their battle, Alex almost defeats Cross, when Cross mentions 'Penn Station', triggering a flashback that leaves Alex dazed. Alex is injected with a parasite that threatens to kill him. Alex seeks help from Dr. Ragland, a pathologist linked to Gentek. Ragland helps Alex remove the parasite and turn it into a weapon against Greene. However, it has no effect on Greene as her body rejected the parasite immediately, and the rejected biomass forms a monstrous being, the Supreme Hunter, which Alex kills. Alex later finds and kills Karen in revenge for setting him up.\n\nThe origins of the virus and Elizabeth Greene are uncovered through a contact: in 1969 the government tested the virus' predecessor in Hope, Idaho, designed to target predetermined races. Although the entire town was infected, no ill effects manifested until Elizabeth Greene's infection. An anomaly in her body's biology accepted the virus, rewriting her genetic code and causing her to take control of the infected town, becoming hostile in the process. The entire population of Hope, Idaho was liquidated by Blackwatch with only Greene and her son, codenamed PARIAH, surviving. Although kept separate, the two were held in captivity for further research. With samples taken from Greene's blood, Gentek's team led by Mercer synthesized the current strain of BLACKLIGHT virus.\n\nAlex discovers his own past: Blackwatch shut down the Gentek project due to leaks and ordered all project personnel eliminated. Alex Mercer took a sample of BLACKLIGHT as \"insurance\". Eventually pinned down by Blackwatch in Penn Station. Alex, in a final act of desperation and vengeance, shatters the vial containing the BLACKLIGHT, releasing the virus before being gunned down. The virus entered Mercer's bloodstream through the bullet holes and repaired his body at the cellular level.\n\nThe contact and Alex pump a new \"BLOODTOX\" biological agent underground in order to drive the virus above ground where it can be fought directly, causing Greene to emerge, encased in a towering monstrosity. Greene falls from the monster in human form once she is defeated, and is consumed by Alex. Through her memories, it becomes apparent that General Randall, head of Blackwatch, is prepared to destroy Manhattan with a nuclear weapon. Alex, with the help of the contact - revealed to be Cross - infiltrates the USS Ronald Reagan to stop Randall. Once Alex consumes Randall, Cross is revealed to be the Supreme Hunter, who assumed Cross' identity after consuming him, and attacks Alex, asserting that when Blackwatch leaves NYZ (New York Zero, the name given to the city after the outbreak) they will no longer be searching for infected, and that after he consumes Alex, he will then be strong enough to survive the nuclear detonation. Alex defeats the Supreme Hunter and moves the weapon out into the Atlantic Ocean with a helicopter, where it detonates and catches him in the blast. His remains float back to the city and regenerate after consuming a crow.\n\nDuring the credits, it is revealed that the public considers the military to have been the one who stopped the infection; a US Senator is heard telling the media that the events in Manhattan were a case of nuclear and biological terrorism, and promises retribution upon those responsible. Alex, reflecting on the events that occurred and the truth he uncovered about himself, claims he has \"become something less than human, but also something more\". After the credits, Manhattan is shown to be slowly recovering, with the virus close to eradicated. Alex, standing on top of the Reuters Building in Times Square, comments that his work is almost done.\n\nThe main protagonist Alex Mercer is voiced by Canadian actor Barry Pepper. Alex's sister Dana Mercer is voiced by Lake Bell and the primary antagonist, Robert Cross (CODENAME: THE SPECIALIST) is voiced by Jeff Pierce. Phil LaMarr voiced Dr. Bradley Ragland, who was helping Alex when Cross injected him with an Anti-Blacklight virus. Alex Mercer ex-girlfriend Karen Parker is voiced by Vanessa Marshall. Alex's boss Dr. Raymond McMullen is voiced by Paul Guilfoyle who also played Jim Brass in \"\". Gordon Clapp voiced Gen. Peter Randall who wants to contain Alex. Randall 2nd in-command Ian Taggart is voiced by Richard McGonagle. Kari Wahlgren voiced Elizabeth Green also known as \"The Mother\" who was infected with the virus in 1969. Brian Bloom voiced a Blackwatch commander who is yelling at the time when Mercer transforms into his disguise in the base. All additional characters are voiced by Dave Fennoy, Dave Wittenberg, David Andriole, David Lodge, and Diane Hsu.\n\nA six-issue comic book series made by DC Comics Wildstorm was a spin-off as a prequel to the game and released alongside. It reveals more about Hope Idaho, Elizabeth Greene, and the viral outbreak. \n\nThe game received \"generally favorable reviews\" on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. \"Prototype\" was released on Steam as well as in retail stores and topped the Steam sales on the week of its release. The Xbox 360 version of \"Prototype\" was the top selling game of June 2009 in North America, with over 419,900 units sold. This made the game a Platinum Hit. As of March 2012, the game had sold 2.1 million copies worldwide.\n\nGameSpot praised the game for its \"intriguing storyline and protagonist\" and \"massive arsenal of moves and abilities\", but criticized it for its \"occasionally fiddly controls\" and \"dull scenery\". \"The Escapist\" said the Xbox 360 version was a perfect \"summer fling,\" praising the combat and movement systems as well as the unique mechanic of the Web of Intrigue. \"The A.V. Club\" gave the same console version an \"A−\" ranking, calling the movement style \"exhilarating\" and saying it was a \"mature, science-fiction superhero fantasy that somehow makes players feel simultaneously powerful and vulnerable.\" 411Mania gave it a score of eight out of ten and called it \"an entirely different type of sandbox game that will attract and please most gamers.\" \"The Daily Telegraph\" gave it a similar score of eight out of ten and said it \"offers an action-filled experience that few games can match, and the array of attacks on offer is almost unparalleled in both its variety and its easy accessibility. The pure adrenaline-boosting entertainment value of the finished product is enough to push most visual and gameplay niggles far enough into the background so as to eradicate them as concerns in all but the most snobbish of gamers.\" \"Edge\" also gave it a score of eight out of ten, saying that the game \"does what it does, and does it with distinction.\" However, \"Teletext GameCentral\" gave it five out of ten, concluding, \"The initial feelings of power and freedom hide another badly designed and unimaginative superhero sim.\"\n\n\"Prototype\" was released two weeks after Sucker Punch Productions' \"Infamous\", a game with many similar concepts including a character with superpowers, and a large open world environment that can be traveled by climbing up buildings and gliding about the city. This led many game critics to compare and contrast the games. In his Zero Punctuation review of \"Prototype\", Ben \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw compared the two games point for point, and determined that he could not tell which was the better game - \"Prototype\" won on open world gameplay and combat, while \"Infamous\" won on story and side missions. To decide which one was better, he jokingly stated that he'd award the best game to the team which created the best picture of the other main character wearing \"a woman's bra\". To his surprise, both development teams rose to the challenge, producing said images, and forcing Croshaw to call it a near-tie, edging out in favor of \"Infamous\", though he still noted that, like their games, both images created independently were nearly equal in the themes that they included.\n\n\"Prototype 2\" was released on April 24, 2012 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and on July 24, 2012 in North America and July 30, 2012 in Europe for Windows. \"Prototype 2\" takes place three years after the events of the first game and stars a new protagonist, U.S. Marine Sergeant James Heller. Alex Mercer, on the other hand, becomes the franchise's main antagonist. \n"}
{"id": "42402046", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42402046", "title": "Racebending", "text": "Racebending\n\nRacebending is a neologism that describes the changing of a character's perceived race or ethnicity during the adaptation of a work from one medium to another. Racebending was coined as a term of protest in 2009 as a response to the casting decisions for the live-action film adaptation of the television series \".\" The starring roles of the show (Aang, , and Sokka) were intended to be of Asian and Inuit descent, but were cast by Caucasian actors in the film. The initial protests such as \"Saving the World with Postage,\" were created in a LiveJournal online forum that initially responded to the casting decisions by \"inundating Paramount with protest mail.\" However, the cast went unaltered and when production began, the leaders of this protest responded by founding the advocacy group and accompanying website \"Racebending\" by \"playfully borrowing the concept of manipulating elements (bending) from the \"Avatar\" universe.\"\n\nThe Racebending.com website defines \"racebending\" as, \"situations where a media content creator (movie studio, publisher, etc.) has changed the race or ethnicity of a character. This is a longstanding Hollywood practice that has been historically used to discriminate against people of color.\" The website also states that the coining of the term predates the issue itself. Whitewashing, particularly common in film, \"possesses a long tradition among the industry's most successful and venerated productions. Film history is replete with ignominious examples of white actors portraying characters of color.\"\n\nAccording to Christina Shu Jien Chong, racebending, whitewashing and an overall lack of representation of Asians as well as other minorities in the film industry is due to lack of minority applicants, lack of opportunities for minorities due to a connection-based culture in the entertainment industry created through implicit bias, and breakdowns, casting descriptions that usually include characteristics including a characters name, gender, age, race, minor personality traits and a brief life background. Chong does not consider breakdowns problematic in themselves, but as stated by Russell Robinson in a research article published by the Berkeley Law Scholarship Repository, they tend to discriminate against minorities in the entertainment industry. Part of Robinson's argument against breakdowns is that they are usually created by studio directors and 87% of directors are white. Robinson claims that these directors as well as others within the film industry can easily decide to change the race of a breakdown or of a character being adapted from another form of media. Robinson stated, \"Any person in this decision-making chain might exclude an actor or an entire category of actors based on race or sex-based considerations, yet this discrimination would normally remain concealed from the excluded applicants and the public.\" According to Robinson, there are circles of \"the wealthy elite in Hollywood\" whose \"implicit biases\", covered up by breakdowns, lead to a significant amount of racebending and whitewashing within the film industry.\n\nMany producers and directors in the film industry believe that it is not racial discrimination that leads to racebending, whitewashing, and an overall lack of minority representation in the film industry. Instead, many accredit it to a low number of minority applicants and the lack of funding they would receive if they did cast minorities in lead roles. In response to critic backlash after the release of the film \"21\", which is based on the true story of a group of Asian American students who in the film are portrayed mostly by Caucasian actors, producer Dana Brunetti claimed, \"We would have loved to cast Asians in the lead roles, but the truth is, we didn't have access to any bankable Asian-American actors that we wanted.\" Furthermore, Ridley Scott claimed, after the release of his film \"\", which faced a similar whitewashing controversy, \"I can't mount a film of this budget, where I have to rely on tax rebates in Spain and say that my lead actor is Muhammad so-and-so from such-and-such. I'm just not going to get it financed. So the question doesn't even come up.\"\n\nAfter the producers of \"The Last Airbender\" announced their decision to cast white actors Noah Ringer, Nicola Peltz and Jackson Rathbone as the lead roles, the artists who had worked on it was based on created an anonymous LiveJournal website and started a letter-writing campaign. On the other hand, the actors portraying the antagonist characters are mainly Middle Eastern and Indian. Two fans from the LiveJournal website, known as glockgal and jedifreac, realized there were more cases regarding racebending other than \"The Last Airbender\" movie, leading them to create their own forum against racebending as a whole, Racebending.com.\n\nIn 2010, Racebending.com wrote a letter to Nickelodeon's CEO at the time, Jeff Dunn, regarding the audition restrictions for \"Power Rangers Samurai,\" the eighteenth season of the \"Power Rangers\" franchise. The producers of the show had restricted auditions for the Red Ranger to only white actors, but the casting was re-opened in June 2010 to actors of all ethnicities.\n\nThe film \"\" received significant backlash on social media before its release, due to white actors Christian Bale, Joel Edgerton and others being cast to play the roles of Egyptians, while black actors were only given the roles of slaves and thieves. Director Ridley Scott argued that they cast actors of other ethnicities as well (Iranians, Spaniards, Arabs, etc.) because Egyptians have varied ethnicities, and that the audience shouldn't focus on only the white actors.\n\nIn 2010, Racebending.com and the Media Action Network for Asian Americans, alongside urging boycotts of \"The Last Airbender\", also urged boycotts of \"\" as well, due to practices of racebending. \"Prince of Persia\" was criticized for casting white actors for the leads instead of actors of Iranian or Middle Eastern descent.\n\nWhen Scarlett Johansson was cast in the lead role of Motoko Kusanagi in \"Ghost in the Shell\", a live-action adaptation of the Japanese manga, there was fan backlash over the casting as, since the story is located within Japan, it was assumed that the actress to portray the character was meant to be of Japanese descent, and numerous fans signed petitions for a recast. Johansson addressed the issue in an interview for \"Marie Claire\" magazine, stating that she never would have accepted the role if it meant taking it from an Asian actor. Johansson explained how she accepted the part because the main protagonist was female and \"having a franchise with a female protagonist driving it is such a rare opportunity.\" Activists groups, such as the Media Action Network for Asian Americans (MANAA) accused Johansson of lying that she would never portray or attempt to play someone of a different race. Their complaints stemmed in the idea that they believed Hollywood was not allowing Asians to portray Asian characters, and instead, was hiring white actors to take roles that could easily have been portrayed by an Asian actor and actress. Asian actors such as Constance Wu and Ming-Na Wen called for a boycott of the movie because they thought that it was unfair that the role did not go to an Asian woman. The Founding President of MANAA, Guy Aoki, stated, \"Hollywood continues to make the same excuses, that there aren't big enough Asian/Asian American names to open a blockbuster film. Yet it has not developed a farm system where such actors get even third billing in most pictures. Without a conscientious effort, how will anyone ever break through and become familiar enough with audiences so producers will confidently allow them to topline a film? When will we ever break that glass ceiling?\" The film spurned many different conversations on how to allow actors and actresses of minority groups to have the spotlight, as well as created discussions on how to end these endemic problems throughout Hollywood.\n\nConversely, when \"Harry Potter\" received an addition to its installment with the stage play \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\", it was announced that the character Hermione would be played by Noma Dumezweni, an African actress residing in England. Fans were displeased with this and called it \"reverse whitewashing\", but J. K. Rowling, the author of the original series, stated in a tweet that white skin was never specified in the making of the character Hermione, but rather being intelligent and smart.\n\nThe Racebending website acknowledges that often the terms \"whitewashing\" and \"racebending\" are used interchangeably, but that occasionally, the effects of racebending can have a positive impact. Racebending can, at times, result in increased representation for minorities if a \"white role\" is altered to be played by a minority. The website gave as examples of positive racebending Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films, Cinderella (Brandy Norwood) and Prince Christopher (Paolo Montalban) in The Wonderful World of Disney's retelling of \"Cinderella\" (1997), and Velma (Hayley Kiyoko) in \"Scooby-Doo! The Mystery Begins\" (2009), stating that, although minimal, \"for communities of color, these casting decisions meant representation and meaningful inclusion in the American storytelling landscape.\"\n\nUsage evolved, and by 2015, media studies academic Kristen J. Warner wrote that the term has \"many definitions and contexts\", from the film industry practice of color-blind casting to fan fiction. She describes how writers can \"change the race and cultural specificity of central characters or pull a secondary character of color from the margins, transforming her into the central protagonist.\"\n\n\"Paste\"s Abbey White said in 2016 that the term can apply to actors of color being cast in traditionally white roles. White said, \"In the last several years, racebending has become a practice used more and more to help networks diversify their ensembles and capture a bigger audience. Not only has it resulted in more racial visibility on the small screen, but in a far more unexpected way, racebending can generate deeper and more significant depictions of characters.\"\n\nAccording to a 2016 University of Southern California report on diversity in entertainment within which 414 stories were sampled, 109 motion pictures and 305 broadcast, cable and digital series, \"71.7% were white, 12.2% Black, 5.8% Hispanic/Latino, 5.1% Asian, 2.3% Middle Eastern and 3.1% other\", in contrast to the United States Census Bureau's population estimates for July of 2016 being \"63.3% White, 12.6% Black, 16.2% Hispanic/Latino, 4.9% Asian, 2.1% mixed, 1.0% other.\" The University of Southern California report noted that it sampled all \"independent speaking character utters one or more discernible and overt words (of any language) on screen. Nonverbal utterances are not considered words. Characters that are named are also considered speaking characters. Under rare circumstances, a group of nearly identical characters might speak at the exact same time or sequentially. Given their extreme homogeneous appearance, it is impossible to distinguish these characters from another. When this occurs, the coders are instructed to \"group\" the identical characters and code them as one unit.\" According to Christina Shu Jien Chong's article in the Asian Pacific American Law Journal, \"Whites occupied 83.5% of lead roles while minorities occupied 16.5%; 9.5% Black, 2% Latino, 2.5% Asian, 0.5% Native American, and 2% Mixed/Other.\" According to Chong, when it comes to casting for major roles, racebending, whitewashing and implicit bias lead to an even more drastic underrepresentation of minorities in the entertainment industry.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "52203667", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52203667", "title": "Riddles (Persian)", "text": "Riddles (Persian)\n\nThe Persian term for riddle is chīstān, literally 'what is it?', a word that frequently occurs in the opening formulae of Persian riddles. However, the Arabic loan-word \"lughaz\" is also used. Traditional Persian rhetorical manuals almost always handle riddles, but Persian riddles have enjoyed little modern scholarly attention. Yet in the assessment of A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, 'Persian literary riddles provide us with some of the most novel and intricate metaphors and images in Persian poetry'.\n\nPersian riddles occur in several different literary forms, and it is helpful to trace the history of the Persian riddle through these forms. It is assumed that folk-riddles circulated in Persian from early times, and riddles are prominent in Persian romances set in earlier, pre-Islamic times, perhaps indicating the earlier popularity of the form. Erotic allusions are common in medieval Persian riddles, as in other kinds of metaphorical description.\n\nIt is unclear how medieval Persian riddles were actually performed. Whereas the genre of conundrum known as \"mu‘ammā\" circulated in manuscripts without solutions, riddles were provided with their solutions in medieval and later manuscripts, so it is possible that poets would announce the solution before performing the riddle.\n\nThese riddles overlap with and blur into the literary genre of \"wasf\" (detailed, metaphorical description), usually appearing in the opening section (\"nasīb\") of a \"qasīdah\". It seems clear that the literary riddle emerged from \"wasf\". This genre includes the earliest attested Persian riddles, from around the ninth to eleventh centuries. Some examples may not originally have been riddles, but rather metaphorical descriptions that, in transmission, became divorced from their original contexts, coming to seem like riddles in the process. One example is this anonymous one, cited by Shams-i Qeys in his \"Kitāb al-mu‘jam\":\n\n<poem style=\"margin-left:2em\">\nWhat is it that tears into small pieces\nwhatever falls in its toothless mouth?\nIf you put your fingers in its eyes\nit will instantly prick up its ears.\n</poem>\n\nThe answer is 'scissors'.\n\nAs the hugely popular descriptive literature in the khorāsānī style became increasingly metaphorical, so too it necessarily became more riddle-like, and by the eleventh century an 'almost codified form of riddle' can be identified, though the boundary between riddle and description is very hard to draw: texts which are unambiguously to be categorised as riddles are not numerous and the process whereby the riddle emerged as a literary form is not altogether clear. However, key exponents of the descriptive riddle form were the innovative poet Mas‘ūd Sā‘d Salmān (d. 1121), who composed at least twelve riddles or riddle-like descriptions, his successors ‘Uthmān Mukhtārī (d. 1118×21) and Ḥakīm Sanā’ī (d. 1131×41), and Amīr Mu‘izzī (d. 1125), whose \"divan\" includes fourteen riddles. An example is the following riddle by Amīr Mu‘izzī, which involves a series of puns on the different meanings of the word \"tir\" ('rank, importance; Mercury, associated with scribes and scholars; arrow'):\n\n<poem style=\"margin-left:2em\">\nWhat is that body that has received \"tir\" [importance] from the \"tir\" of the sky [Mercury]?\nWhen it weeps, the soul will smile in the body;\nWhen it sheds tears, it displays precious jewels,\nWhatever nature can conceive, it collates\n</poem>\n\nLater literary riddles tend to be very obscure in style, even to the point of being unsolvable today.\n\nSeveral Persian romances include some kind of test of verbal wisdom. The earliest is ‘Unṣurī's eleventh-century \"Vāmiq u ‘Adhrā\", but the one most clearly conforming to the riddle genre occurs in the renowned \"Shāh Nāma\", when Manuchehr asks six Zoroastrian priests to test the wits of Zāl in his suit for Rūdāba. These are less obscure than the descriptive riddles, tending to feature metaphors and tropes which anyone familiar with Persian poetic conventions could be expected to recognise. For example, in the \"Shāh Nāma\" (taking just one variant of a text that varies dramatically from one manuscript to another),\n\n<poem style=\"margin-left:2em\">\nAnother priest said: 'O proud warrior:\nthere are two noble and fleet horses\nOne of them is like a black sea,\nthe other glistens like white crystal.\nThey are both exerting themselves, racing in haste\nBut neither can catch the other.\n</poem>\n\nZāl answers this riddle as follows:\n\n<poem style=\"margin-left:2em\">\nThe two running horses, black and white\nthat cannot catch each other in the race:\nKnow, O puzzler, that they are night and day,\nin order that you may feel puzzlement.\n</poem>\n\nA very specific type of riddle appears in the twelfth century, in ethico-philosophical epics, in a form probably invented by ‘Uthmān Mukhtārī, who used it in his \"Hunar-nāma\": the riddle comprises ten couplets posing ethical questions, followed by two couplets in which the poet delivers his answers. One example is the following riddle (\"Hunar-nāma\" couplets 343-52):\n\n<poem style=\"margin-left:2em\">\nHe said: 'What then is that yielding twig,\nThe face of generosity and the body of magnanimity,\nThe title of confirmation and the letter of conferral,\nThe source of generosity and the origin of reward,\nThe ornament and beauty of the seal and the dagger,\nIt is disdain for gold and scorn for coins,\nWere the cloud to adopt its habits,\nIf the sun left its traces as this thing does,\nIts movements are the vanguards of reward,\nIn the time of struggle, it is stronger than the ocean,\n</poem>\n\nThe narrator provides the following solution:\n\n<poem style=\"margin-left:2em\">\nI said: 'This is the hand of the free-giving king,\nSo long as water, earth, fire and wind exist,\n</poem>\n\nMedieval Persian literature also attests to numerous \"qit‘a\"s (quatrains) posing varied, often occasional, tests of wit.\n\nPersian also adopted the conundrum form \"mu‘ammā\" from Arabic. These conundra are in verse, do not include an interrogatory element, and involve clues as to the letters or sounds of the word. The main study is by Shama Anwari-Alhosseyni.\n\nAlthough folk riddles are not attested until relatively recently, it is assumed that they existed from ancient times onwards, predating and informing the medieval literary riddle tradition. It appears that the main collection remains that published by Charles Scott in 1965.\n\nScott identifies the following (sometimes overlapping) key forms in his riddles, which were collected in the earlier twentieth century in Teheran and Afghanistan:\n\n\nExamples of the four types follow:\n\nScott also records a riddle-game of a highly formulaic kind from Afghan informants. The speaker (S) requires the hearer (H) to guess a real-life family of their acquaintance by enumerating its members, concluding with the formula 'ešan zænu šuy' ('they, wife and husband') on the pattern of this example:\n\nIf the hearer fails to guess the answer, they must pretend to grant a city to the speaker, through the following formula:\n\n"}
{"id": "1742287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1742287", "title": "Risk society", "text": "Risk society\n\nRisk society is the manner in which modern society organizes in response to risk. The term is closely associated with several key writers on modernity, in particular Ulrich Beck and Anthony Giddens. The term was coined in the 1980s and its popularity during the 1990s was both as a consequence of its links to trends in thinking about wider modernity, and also to its links to popular discourse, in particular the growing environmental concerns during the period.\n\nAccording to British sociologist Anthony Giddens, a risk society is \"a society increasingly preoccupied with the future (and also with safety), which generates the notion of risk,\" whilst the German sociologist Ulrich Beck defines it as \"a systematic way of dealing with hazards and insecurities induced and introduced by modernisation itself (Beck 1992:21)\".\n\nBeck (1992:50) defined modernization as,\n\nBeck and Giddens both approach the risk society firmly from the perspective of modernity, \"a shorthand term for modern society or industrial civilization... modernity is vastly more dynamic than any previous type of social order. It is a society... which unlike any preceding culture lives in the future rather than the past.\" (Anthony Giddens) They also draw heavily on the concept of reflexivity, the idea that as a society examines itself, it in turn changes itself in the process. In classical industrial society, the modernist view is based on assumption of realism in science creating a system in which scientists work in an exclusive, inaccessible environment.\n\nIn 1986, right after the Chernobyl disaster, Ulrich Beck, a sociology professor at the University of Munich, published the original German text, \"Risikogesellschaft\", of his highly influential and catalytic work (Suhrkamp, Frankfurt 1986). \"Risikogesellschaft\" was published in English as \"Risk Society: Towards a New Modernity\" in 1992. The ecological crisis is central to this social analysis of the contemporary period. Beck argued that environmental risks had become the predominant product, not just an unpleasant, manageable side-effect, of industrial society.\n\nGiddens and Beck argued that whilst humans have always been subjected to a level of risk – such as natural disasters – these have usually been perceived as produced by non-human forces. Modern societies, however, are exposed to risks such as pollution, newly discovered illnesses, crime, that are the result of the modernization process itself. Giddens defines these two types of risks as external risks and manufactured risks. Manufactured risks are marked by a high level of human agency involved in both producing, and mitigating such risks.\n\nAs manufactured risks are the product of human activity, authors like Giddens and Beck argue that it is possible for societies to assess the level of risk that is being produced, or that is about to be produced. This sort of reflexive introspection can in turn alter the planned activities themselves. As an example, disasters such as Chernobyl and the Love Canal Crisis, public faith in the modern project has declined leaving public distrust in industry, government and experts.\n\nSocial concerns led to increased regulation of the nuclear power industry and to the abandonment of some expansion plans, altering the course of modernization itself. This increased critique of modern industrial practices is said to have resulted in a state of reflexive modernization, illustrated by concepts such as sustainability and the precautionary principle that focus on preventative measures to decrease levels of risk.\n\nThere are differing opinions as to how the concept of a risk society interacts with social hierarchies and class distinctions. Most agree that social relations have altered with the introduction of manufactured risks and reflexive modernization. Risks, much like wealth, are distributed unevenly in a population and will influence quality of life.\n\nBeck has argued that older forms of class structure – based mainly on the accumulation of wealth – atrophy in a modern, risk society, in which people occupy social risk positions that are achieved through risk aversion. \"In some of their dimensions these follow the inequalities of class and strata positions, but they bring a fundamentally different distribution logic into play\". Beck contends that widespread risks contain a 'boomerang effect', in that individuals producing risks will also be exposed to them. This argument suggests that wealthy individuals whose capital is largely responsible for creating pollution will also have to suffer when, for example, the contaminants seep into the water supply. This argument may seem oversimplified, as wealthy people may have the ability to mitigate risk more easily by, for example, buying bottled water. Beck, however, has argued that the distribution of this sort of risk is the result of knowledge, rather than wealth. Whilst the wealthy person may have access to resources that enable him or her to avert risk, this would not even be an option were the person unaware that the risk even existed. However, Risks do not only affect those of a certain social class or place, risk is not bias and can affect everybody no matter your class, nobody is free from risk.\n\nBy contrast, Giddens has argued that older forms of class structure maintain a somewhat stronger role in a risk society, now being partly defined \"in terms of differential access to forms of self-actualization and empowerment\". Giddens has also tended to approach the concept of a risk society more positively than Beck, suggesting that there \"can be no question of merely taking a negative attitude towards risk. Risk needs to be disciplined, but active risk-taking is a core element of a dynamic economy and an innovative society.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8311711", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8311711", "title": "Runic magic", "text": "Runic magic\n\nThere is some evidence that, in addition to being a writing system, runes historically served purposes of magic. This is the case from earliest epigraphic evidence of the Roman to Germanic Iron Age, with non-linguistic inscriptions and the \"alu\" word. An \"erilaz\" appears to have been a person versed in runes, including their magic applications.\n\nIn medieval sources, notably the Poetic Edda, the \"Sigrdrífumál\" mentions \"victory runes\" to be carved on a sword, \"some on the grasp and some on the inlay, and name Tyr twice.\"\n\nIn early modern and modern times, related folklore and superstition is recorded in the form of the Icelandic magical staves. In the early 20th century, Germanic mysticism coins new forms of \"runic magic\", some of which were continued or developed further by contemporary adherents of Germanic Neopaganism. Modern systems of\nrunic divination are based on Hermeticism, classical Occultism, and the I Ching.\n\nHistorically it is known that the Germanic peoples used various forms of divination and means of reading omens. Tacitus (\"Germania\" 10) gives a detailed account (98AD):\n\nIt is often debated whether \"signs\" refers specifically to runes or to other marks; both interpretations are plausible and Tacitus does not give enough detail for a definite decision to be made.\n\n The Ansuz and Tiwaz runes in particular seem to have had magical significance in the early (Elder Futhark) period. The \"Sigrdrífumál\" instruction of \"name Tyr twice\" is reminiscent of the double or triple \"stacked Tyr\" bindrunes found e.g. on Seeland-II-C or the Lindholm amulet in the \"aaaaaaaazzznnn-b- muttt\", sequence, which besides stacked Tyr involves multiple repetition of Ansuz, but also triple occurrence of Algiz and Naudiz.\nMany inscriptions also have apparently meaningless utterances interpreted as magical chants, such as \"tuwatuwa\" (Vadstena bracteate), \"aaduaaaliia\" (DR BR42) or \"g͡æg͡og͡æ\" (Undley bracteate), \"g͡ag͡ag͡a \" (Kragehul I).\n\nAlu is a charm word appearing on numerous artifacts found in Central and Northern Europe dating from the Germanic Iron Age. The word is the most common of the early runic charm words and can appear either alone or as part of an apparent formula. The origin and meaning of the word are matters of dispute, though a general agreement exists among scholars that the word either represents amulet magic or is a metaphor (or metonym) for it.\n\nA few Viking Age rings with runic inscriptions of apparently magical nature were found, among them the Kingmoor Ring. The phrase \"runes of power\" is found on two runestones in Sweden, DR 357 from Stentoften and DR 360 from Björketorp. Runestones with curses include DR 81 in Skjern, DR 83 in Sønder Vinge, DR 209 in Glavendrup, DR 230 from Tryggevælde, DR 338 in Glemminge, and Vg 67 in Saleby.\n\nThe most prolific source for runic magic in the Poetic Edda is the \"Sigrdrífumál\", where the valkyrie Sigrdrífa (Brynhild) presents Sigurd with a memory-draught of ale that had been charmed with \"gladness runes\" (stanza 5), \n\nShe goes on to give advice on the magical runes in seven further stanzas. In all instances, the runes are used for actual magic (apotropaic or ability-enhancing spells) rather than for divination:\n\nThe Poetic Edda also seems to corroborate the magical significance of the runes the \"Hávamál\" where Odin mentions runes in contexts of divination, of healing and of necromancy (trans. Bellows):\n\nOther oft cited sources for the practice of runic divination are chapter 38 of Snorri Sturluson's Ynglinga Saga, where Granmar, the king of Södermanland, travels to the Temple at Uppsala for the seasonal blót. \"There, the chips fell in a way that said that he would not live long\" (\"Féll honum þá svo spánn sem hann mundi eigi lengi lifa\").\n\nAnother source is in the Vita Ansgari, the biography of Ansgar the Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen, which was written by a monk named Rimbert. Rimbert details the custom of casting lots by the pagan Norse (chapters 26-30). The chips and the lots, however, can be explained respectively as a \"blótspánn\" (sacrificial chip) and a \"hlauttein\" (lot-twig), which according to Foote and Wilson would be \"marked, possibly with sacrificial blood, shaken and thrown down like dice, and their positive or negative significance then decided.\"\n\nEgils Saga features several incidents of runic magic. The most celebrated is the scene where Egil discovers (and destroys) a poisoned drink prepared for him, by cutting his hand and cutting runes on the drinking horn, and painting the runes with blood. While the motif of blood painted runes also appears in other examples of early Norse literature it is uncertain whether the practice of painting runes with blood is merely a literary invention or whether it had precedence in magical practice.\n\nIn the 17th Century, Hermeticist and Rosicrucian Johannes Bureus, having been inspired by visions, developed a Runic system based on the Kaballah and the Futhark which he called the \"Adulruna\".\n\nThe Armanen runes \"revealed\" to Guido von List in 1902 were employed for magical purposes in Germanic mysticism by authors such as Friedrich Bernhard Marby and Siegfried Adolf Kummer, and after World War II in a reformed \"pansophical\" system by Karl Spiesberger. More recently, Stephen Flowers, Adolf Schleipfer, Larry E. Camp and others also build on List's system.\n\nSeveral modern systems of runic magic and runic divination were published from the 1980s onward. The first book on runic divination, written by Ralph Blum in 1982, led to the development of sets of runes designed for use in several such systems of fortune telling, in which the runes are typically incised in clay, stone tiles, crystals, resin, glass, or polished stones, then either selected one-by-one from a closed bag or thrown down at random for reading.\n\nLater authors such as Diana L. Paxson and Freya Aswynn follow Blum (1989) in drawing a direct correlation between runic divination and tarot divination. They may discuss runes in the context of \"spreads\" and advocate the usage of \"rune cards\".\n\nModern authors like Ralph Blum sometimes include a \"blank rune\" in their sets. Some were to replace a lost rune, but according to Ralph Blum this was the god Odin's rune, the rune of the beginning and the end, representing \"the divine in all human transactions\".\n\nIn 1982, a modern usage of the runes for answering life's questions was apparently originated by Ralph Blum in his divination book \"The Book of Runes: A Handbook for the Use of an Ancient Oracle\", which was marketed with a small bag of round tiles with runes stamped on them. This book has remained in print since its first publication. The sources for Blum's divinatory interpretations, as he explained in \"The Book of Runes\" itself, drew heavily on then-current books describing the ancient I Ching divination system of China.\n\nEach of Blum's seven books on runic divination deals with a specialized area of life or a varied technique for reading runes:\n\nBlum has also written books on the Tao Te Ching, Zen Buddhism, and UFOs.\n\nIn the wake of a 1984 dissertation on \"Runes and Magic\", Stephen Flowers published a series of books under the pen-name \"Edred Thorsson\" which detailed his own original method of runic divination and magic, \"odianism\", which he said was loosely based on historical sources and modern European hermeticism. These books were:\n\nRunic divination is a component of Flowers' \"esoteric runology\" course offered to members of his Rune Gild, as detailed in \"The Nine Doors of Midgard: A Curriculum of Rune-Work.\"\nBesides runic divination, Flowers also advocated the \"runic gymnastics\" (\"Runengymnastik\") developed in the 1920s by Friedrich Marby, under the name of \"Rune-Yoga\" (also \"Runic Yoga\", \"Stadhagaldr\").\n\nIn 1990, Stephan Grundy, a.k.a. Kveldulf Gundarsson, described runic magic as the active principle as opposed to passive interpretations based on runic divination. He held that runic magic is more active than the allegedly shamanic practice of seid practiced by the Seiðkona. Runic magic, he states, uses the runes to affect the world outside based on the archetypes they represent.\n\nMost of Gundarsson's runic magic entails being in possession of a physical entity that is engraved with any or all of the individual runes or \"staves\", so as to practically work with their energies. The individual runes are reddened with either blood, dyes, or paints. The act of possessing the stave in its final form serves the purpose of affecting the world of form with \"the rune might\" of that particular stave. After use, the staves are discarded or destroyed.\n\nGundarsson holds that each rune has a certain sound to it, to be chanted or sung; the sound has in common the phonetic value by which it is represented. This act of singing or chanting is supposed to have more or less the same effect of using the staves in their physical form.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Shryer also elaborated on searching for this, \"state of awareness,\" by the means of, \"one tend[ing] an open ear in the hopes of experiencing the sublime beauty of a given sound in an unexpected context.\" The experience of the sharawadji sonic effect is often heavily dictated by personal context as well as the perception of the listener. One striking example of this effect is the appreciation of the sound of rumbling thunder: those who are being directly exposed to the element would be more likely to fear it compared to those who experience the sound while in a safe environment. Simply understood, \"sharawadji sounds belong to everyday life, to a known musical style. They become sharawadji only through decontextualization, through a rupture of meaning.\"\n\nSeventeenth-century European travelers originally coined the term as an aesthetic effect that, \"comes about as a surprise and will carry you elsewhere, beyond strict representation — out of context.\" The term \"sharawadji\" was speculated to originate from China and was understood as, \"the beauty that occurs with no discernible order or arrangement\".\n\n\"All of us are searching for that enveloping soundscape that takes us beyond to indescribable realms of beauty, what the Persian philosophers once called the \"sharawadji effect\".\"\n\n"}
{"id": "55875", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55875", "title": "Tabard", "text": "Tabard\n\nA tabard is a type of short coat that was commonly worn by men during the late Middle Ages and early modern period in Europe. Generally worn outdoors, the coat was either sleeveless or had short sleeves or shoulder pieces. In its more developed form it was open at the sides, and it could be worn with or without a belt. Though most were ordinary garments, often workclothes, tabards might be emblazoned on the front and back with a coat of arms (livery), and in this form they survive as the distinctive garment of officers of arms.\n\nIn modern British usage, the term has been revived for what is known in American English as a cobbler apron: a lightweight open-sided upper overgarment, of similar design to its medieval and heraldic counterpart, worn in particular by workers in the catering, cleaning and healthcare industries as protective clothing, or outdoors by those requiring high-visibility clothing.\n\nA tabard (from the French \"tabarde\") was originally a humble outer garment of tunic form, generally without sleeves, worn by peasants, monks and foot-soldiers. In this sense, the earliest citation recorded in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" dates from c.1300.\n\nA tabard was the inn sign of the Tabard Inn in Southwark, London, established in 1307 and remembered as the starting point for Geoffrey Chaucer's pilgrims on their journey to Canterbury in \"The Canterbury Tales\", dating from about the 1380s.\n\nBy the second half of the 15th century, tabards, now open at the sides and so usually belted, were also being worn by knights in military contexts over their armour, and were usually emblazoned with their arms (though sometimes worn plain). The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" first records this use of the word in English in 1450. Tabards were apparently distinguished from surcoats by being open-sided, and by being shorter. In its later form, a tabard normally comprised four textile panels – two large panels hanging down the wearer's front and back, and two smaller panels hanging over his arms as shoulder-pieces or open \"sleeves\" – each emblazoned with the same coat of arms. Tabards became an important means of battlefield identification with the development of plate armour as the use of shields declined. They are frequently represented on tomb effigies and monumental brasses of the late 15th and early 16th centuries.\n\nA very expensive, but plain, garment described as a tabard is worn by Giovanni Arnolfini in the Arnolfini Portrait of 1434 (National Gallery, London). This may be made of silk and or velvet, and is trimmed and fully lined with fur, possibly sable.\n\nAt The Queen's College, Oxford, the scholars on the foundation were called tabarders, from the tabard (not in this case an emblazoned garment) which they wore.\n\nA surviving garment similar to the medieval tabard is the monastic scapular. This is a wide strip of fabric worn front back of the body, with an opening for the head and no sleeves. It may have a hood, and may be worn under or over a belt.\n\nBy the end of the 16th century, the tabard was particularly associated with officers of arms. The shift in emphasis was reported by John Stow in 1598, when he described a tabard as:\n\nIn the case of Royal officers of arms, the tabard is emblazoned with the coat of arms of the sovereign. Private officers of arms, such as still exist in Scotland, make use of tabards emblazoned with the coat of arms of the person who employs them. In the United Kingdom the different ranks of officers of arms can be distinguished by the fabric from which their tabards are made. The tabard of a king of arms is made of velvet, the tabard of a herald of arms of satin, and that of a pursuivant of arms of damask silk. The oldest surviving English herald's tabard is that of Sir William Dugdale as Garter King of Arms (1677–1686).\n\nIt was at one time the custom for pursuivants to wear their tabards \"athwart\", that is to say with the smaller (\"shoulder\") panels at the front and back, and the larger panels over the arms; but this practice was ended during the reign of James II and VII.\n\nIn the Diamond Jubilee year of the Queen of Canada, the Governor General unveiled a new tabard for the use of the Chief Herald of Canada. This new royal blue tabard, for exclusively Canadian use and of uniquely Canadian design, is a modern take on the traditional look. The tabard differs from others of more traditional design in that the Canadian royal arms appear on the sleeves, while the front and back of the tabard are covered with Native Canadian-inspired emblematic representations of the raven-polar bears of the Canadian Heraldic Authority's coat of arms.\n\n"}

It differs from both mass tourism and \"independent tourism\", a type of tourism involving absolutely no mediators in the tour organization. \nT.R. operators usually represent the country they live and work in. T.R. operators are known for having advanced knowledge of the culture and history of their country, as well as for having tight and constant connections with local population. Because they are residents of the country, T.R. operators are capable of providing unique services for foreign guests.\n\nTour-realism, as a tourism subgenre, tends to have certain defining characteristics. Tour-realism is generally done in small groups of 3-5 persons, usually family members or groups of friends. The approach is individualized (not reliant on standard itineraries) and focuses on high-quality offerings, with flexible choice of apartments and excursions that depend on the demands and wishes of the client. Accommodations are most often private villas, cottages etc., with an emphasis on creating an \"authentic\" experience as befits the culture and locale, again dependent on the wishes of the client. \"Extras\" in terms of excursions and services are built-in to create a personalized, unique experience for the client, and outings will include both the well-known and the obscure.\n\n"}

One form of travel technology is flight tracking.\n\nSince travel implies locomotion, travel technology was originally associated with the computer reservations system (CRS) of the airlines industry, but now is used more inclusively, incorporating the broader tourism sector as well as its subset the hospitality industry. While travel technology includes the computer reservations system, it also represents a much broader range of applications, in fact increasingly so. Travel technology includes virtual tourism in the form of virtual tour technologies. Travel technology may also be referred to as \"e-travel\" / \"etravel\" or \"e-tourism\" / \"etourism\" (eTourism), in reference to \"electronic travel\" or \"electronic tourism\".\n\ne-Tourism can be defined as the analysis, design, implementation and application of IT and e-commerce solutions in the travel&tourism industry; as well as the analysis of the respective economic processes and market structures and customer relationship management.\n\nFrom a communication science perspective, eTourism can be also defined as every application of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) within both the hospitality and tourism industry, as well as within the tourism experience.\n\nTravel technology is increasingly being used to describe systems for managing and monitoring travel, including travel tracking and flight tracking systems.\n\nIn other contexts, the term \"travel technology\" can refer to technology intended for use by travelers, such as light-weight laptop computers with universal power supplies or satellite Internet connections. That is not the sense in which it is used here.\n\nTravel technology includes many processes such as dynamic packaging which provide useful new options for consumers. Today the tour guide can be a GPS tour guide, and the guidebook could be an audioguide, podguide or I-Tours, such as City audio guides. The biometric passport may also be included as travel technology in the broad sense.\n\nXML-based technologies have become increasingly important for the travel industry. XML can be used to support air reservation booking or to implement optional services and merchandising functions in the booking process. Another important application of XML is the establishing of direct connections between Airlines and Travel Agencies. In order to create a generally accepted XML-standard, the Open Axis Group was founded.\n\nThe Internet has a powerful impact on hospitality and tourism. For many businesses and locations, the experience starts long before a traveler arrives--it begins with the first visit to the website, when a person sees photos of the location and gets a sense of what to expect. In the hospitality and tourism business, effective use of Internet technologies can improve revenue. Websites, blogs, online advertising, social media, online ordering and information repositories all help convince customers to choose a location or business.\nReservations Systems\n\nBooking engines to allow easy access by consumers and travel professionals; the systems enable individuals to make reservations and compare prices. Many, like Expedia and Orbitz, are available through online interfaces. Booking engines cut costs for travel businesses by reducing call volume and give the traveler more control over their purchasing process.\n\nBecause many tourism businesses are large and dispersed, they use computer systems to stay connected. Computer systems allow communication between branches and locations which makes it easier to streamline reservations and cross-company policies. They are also used internally to keep all of the staff on the same page and make it easier to access information that can improve the guest experience: guest preferences, housekeeping information and reservation details can all be kept on a single system.\n\nMany travelers take some form of mobile communication device with them on the road, whether it is a tablet computer or a mobile phone. To keep customers advised of changes many tourism and hospitality businesses use mobile communication; they send delay notices, offer deals and sponsor location-based advertising. Depending on the type of business the communication might happen through emails, text messaging or GPS tagging, for example.\n\nThe continuing evolution of information technology has had a considerable impact on the travel agency service industry. The widespread public use of the Internet has created a number of conditions that have been game-changers -- in both beneficial and detrimental ways -- to the modern travel agency. As a result, many travel agencies in the 21st century have had to make considerable adaptations to remain solvent and relevant.\n\n\n\n"}

In certain cultures where funeral and burial or cremation ceremonies are important, such vengeful spirits may also be considered as unhappy ghosts of individuals who have not been given a proper funeral.\n\nThe concept of a vengeful ghost seeking retribution for harm that it endured as a living person goes back to ancient times and is part of many cultures. According to such legends and beliefs, they roam the world of the living as restless spirits, seeking to have their grievances redressed, and may not be satisfied until they have succeeded in punishing either their murderers or their tormentors.\n\nIn certain cultures vengeful ghosts are mostly female, said to be women that were unjustly treated during their lifetime. Such women or girls may have died in despair or the suffering they endured may have ended up in early death caused by the ill-treatment or torture they were subject to.\n\nExorcisms and appeasement are among the religious and social customs practiced by various cultures in relation to the vengeful ghost. The northern Aché people group in Paraguay cremated old people thought to harbor dangerous vengeful spirits instead of giving them a customary burial. In cases where the person has been killed and the body disposed of unceremoniously, the cadaver may be exhumed and reburied according to the proper funerary rituals in order to appease the spirit. Others have been known to salt and burn their body, the place where they were killed or the instrument that they were killed with.\n\nVengeful ghosts have been featured in many contemporary movies of different countries such as \"Candyman\", \"The Grudge\", \"The Pit and the Pendulum\", \"\", \"Poltergeist\", \"Ghost\", \"The Fog\", \"High Plains Drifter\", \"The Ward\", \"Cassadaga\", \"Kaal\", \"Left for Dead\", \"Bees Saal Baad\", \"Darling\", \"Ragini MMS\", \"Dark Shadows\" and the \"Troublesome Night\" film series, as well as television series \"Spooky Valentine\", \"Spooky Nights\", \"Charmed\", \"Ghost Whisperer\", \"Supernatural\" and the popular Thai television soap opera \"Raeng Ngao\". They are also part of the theme of novels such as \"Tamír Triad\" and \"Tamsin\", comics such as Gentleman Ghost, animated television series like \"Danny Phantom\" and adventure games such as Chzo Mythos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
