In the attack, a 20 year old British student was stabbed to death by a Palestinian man. Two others, including a pregnant woman, were injured in the incident. The attacker was arrested and was deemed competent to stand trial.\n\nStabbing attacks were rare in Israel in 2017, although there was a spate of them in the fall of 2015 and early 2016. The attack took place as crowds of pilgrims from around Israel and the world gathered in the center of Jerusalem to celebrate Passover and Good Friday.\n\nThe attack occurred at about 1:00 pm 14 April 2017, as a knife-wielding man stabbed a 21 year old British exchange student. An off-duty police officer riding the light rail pulled an emergency brake and tackled the perpetrator, who was then arrested.\n\nAccording to Israel's domestic security service, Shin Bet, the attacker was known to the authorities and the attack may have also involved a \"suicide by soldier\" motivation, as attributed to other incidents in the last 18 months, \"This is yet another case of a Palestinian suffering from personal, mental or moral distress choosing to commit an act of terror to escape his problems.\"\n\nAfter his arrest, pepetrator reportedly told investigators that he stabbed Bladon because he wanted the soldier standing beside her to kill him.\n\nHannah Bladon, a 20-year-old religion, theology and archaeology student in Israel on an exchange program from the University of Birmingham was fatally injured and died in ambulance en route to Hadassah Medical Center. She had been returning from volunteering in an Israel Antiquities Authority archaeological excavation in the Western Wall Tunnel, and was standing next to the attacker after giving up her seat for a women with a baby.\n\nThe accused, Jamil Tamimi (57) a Palestinian Arab from the Ras al-Amud neighborhood of East Jerusalem who was known to security services; according to security services the accused was convicted of molesting his daughter in 2011. The accused had been admitted in the past to Kfar Shaul Mental Health Center, and a day before the attack he voluntarily admitted himself to a mental health treatment center in northern Israel from which he was expelled following a violent assault on a person. On the morning of the attack he spoke to one of his sons who told him that the entire family wanted no contacted with him. He reportedly told investigators he had \"nothing left to lose\", and that he had purchased a knife in the Old City, before boarding a train close to Damascus Gate. Following the attack, the accused was sent for a mental examination by a psychiatrist. Psychiatric examiners judged him mentally fit to stand trial, and he was subsequently charged with premeditated murder.\n\nIn response to this and other recent lone wolf attack, Israeli police have revamped their anti-terrorism tactics, increasing monitoring of social media, improving the intercommunication of mobile devices, and giving security agencies to instantly trace phone calls made such devices.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46214632", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46214632", "title": "A Dream (Blake)", "text": "A Dream (Blake)\n\n\"A Dream\" is a poem by English poet William Blake. The poem was first published in 1789 as part of Blake's collection of poems entitled \"Songs of Innocence\".\n\"Songs of Innocence\" is a collection of 19 illustrated poems published in 1789. According to scholar Donald A. Dike, the collection does not “describe an absolute state of being or fashion an autonomous truth.” Rather, he says the poems are resistant, being “consciously against something and trying to see their way through something.” \n\nSongs of Innocence was followed by Blake's \"Songs of Experience\"' in 1794. The two collections were published together under the title \"Songs of Innocence and of Experience\", showing the \"two contrary states of the human soul.” \n\nOnce a dream did weave a shade\nO'er my angel-guarded bed,\nThat an emmet lost its way\nWhere on grass methought I lay.\n\nTroubled, wildered, and forlorn,\nDark, benighted, travel-worn,\nOver many a tangle spray,\nAll heart-broke, I heard her say:\n\n'Oh my children! do they cry,\nDo they hear their father sigh? \nNow they look abroad to see,\nNow return and weep for me.'\n\nPitying, I dropped a tear:\nBut I saw a glow-worm near,\nWho replied, 'What wailing wight\nCalls the watchman of the night?\n\n'I am set to light the ground,\nWhile the beetle goes his round:\nFollow now the beetle's hum; \nLittle wanderer, hie thee home!\n\n“A Dream” is composed of five quatrains using an AABB rhyme scheme. Blake heavily relies on alliteration, assonance, internal rhymes, and eye rhymes, especially in the first and fourth stanzas, to create a connection between sight and sound.\n\nThe poem describes a dream featuring four characters: the narrator, the emmet (an archaic word for ant), the glow-worm, and the beetle. The dream begins with the narrator encountering the main protagonist of the dream, the lost emmet. The worn emmet laments to the narrator about her children back home. The glow-worm, who is “set to light the ground,” becomes the rescuer for the lost emmet. The glow-worm tells the emmet to follow the beetle, who will guide the emmet home.\n\nIsabelle Keller-Privat describes “A Dream” as a piece that, like other Songs of Innocence poems, “emphasizes the interconnections between the actors, the voices and the rhythms that give the poem its coherence and harmony.” This coherence and harmony give the poem its sense of innocence. The world of this poem is portrayed as friendly and the characters are helpful. Yet a hint of experience can also be felt in “A Dream” through the emmet’s fear of its surroundings and its tired, damaged appearance. The emmet has experienced hardship and separation beyond the innocence of the dream.\n\nDike writes that, by putting the dream’s concerns into the world of an insect, Blake extends the “usual limits of sympathy.” Resolution is found for the emmet through cooperation with the other characters of the dream. According to Dike, this introduces the theme that everyone is imperfect and needs help because the emmet requires the assistance of the narrator’s sympathy, the glow-worm’s rescue, and the beetle’s guidance.\n\nHarriet Kramer Linkin explores the inverted maternity plot present in \"A Dream.\" In many of the poems in \"Songs of Innocence\", Blake portrays mothers as nurturing and protective. However, as Linkin writes, in \"A Dream\" the \"inversion of a popular narrative of idealized maternity pointedly suggests that the domestic ideology is nothing more than a fantasy of Generation.\" Rather than a father returning to his waiting wife and children, the mother is the one returning to her husband and children at home. This maternity plot in \"A Dream\" follows a trend of absent mothers in other Songs of Innocence poems. According to Linkin, Blake \"attends to the problematic institution of a domestic ideology that restructures the middle-class family.\" \n\n"}
{"id": "1895358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1895358", "title": "Alan Wake", "text": "Alan Wake\n\nAlan Wake is an action-adventure video game developed by Remedy Entertainment and published by Microsoft Studios, released for the Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows. The story follows best-selling thriller novelist Alan Wake, as he tries to uncover the mystery behind his wife's disappearance during a vacation in the small fictional town of Bright Falls, Washington, all while experiencing events from the plot in his latest novel, which he cannot remember writing, coming to life.\n\nIn its pacing and structure, \"Alan Wake\" is similar to a thriller television series, with episodes that contain plot twists and cliffhangers. The game itself consists of six episodes, and the fiction is continued by two special episodes, titled \"The Signal\" and \"The Writer\", that were made available as downloadable content (DLC) within the same year of the game's release. Together, they make the first season of a possibly longer story. Additionally, a six-episode live-action web series called \"Bright Falls\" acts as a prequel to the game, and a number of related books also expand upon the \"Alan Wake\" story.\n\nChiefly written by Sam Lake, \"Alan Wake\" took over five years to create—an unusually long development time in the game industry. The game received positive reviews from critics, and is often praised for its visuals, sound, narrative, pacing, and atmosphere. \"Alan Wake\" was awarded the first spot in \"Time\" magazine's list of the top 10 video games of 2010. \"Alan Wake's American Nightmare\", a full stand-alone title, was released in February 2012 on the Xbox Live Arcade service. A sequel was in development but was cancelled. However, the scrapped sequel became the foundation and inspiration of Remedy's next title, \"Quantum Break\".\n\n\"Alan Wake\" is described by Remedy as \"the mind of a psychological thriller\" and \"the body of a cinematic action game\" put together. In interviews, the game's creators hold that the game does not belong squarely in the survival horror video game genre. The game is primarily set in the fictional idyllic small town of Bright Falls, Washington. The main gameplay happens in various areas of Bright Falls – such as the forest, a national park, or a farm – during the night time; these are punctuated by calmer, non-combative sequences set during the day.\n\nThe player controls the eponymous protagonist Alan Wake. In the game, a \"darkness\" is taking over humans, animals and objects. These enemies, dubbed the \"Taken\", are murderous shadows that attack Wake, wielding weapons of their own, ranging from mallets and knives to shovels and chainsaws. They vary by speed, size, and the amount of damage they can take, and some can teleport between short distances. Besides the Taken, the player must combat flocks of possessed ravens and animated objects. When enemies are close, Alan can perform a slow-motion cinematic dodge maneuver.\n\nThe Taken are protected by a shield of darkness, initially rendering them impervious to attack; they can only be injured with a firearm after exposure to light, which burns the darkness away. This puts significant emphasis on flashlights in conjunction with conventional weapons, such as a revolver or shotgun. Flashlight beams act as a reticle. The handheld lights Wake can carry can be boosted, which destroys the darkness faster, but also reduces the light's battery level. Besides the conventional shooter gameplay need for reloading ammunition, the player must also insert fresh batteries into the flashlight when they run out, or wait for it to recharge slowly. The strength of the darkness protecting an enemy can vary among the Taken. The amount of darkness remaining is represented by a corona of light that appears when aiming at an enemy, and a stronger darkness may recharge over time. When a Taken is finally destroyed, it disappears.\n\nThe player is often encouraged to take advantage of environmental light sources and placing, and to use other light-based weapons and accessories, such as flare guns, hand-held flares and flashbangs. Wake can use searchlights to take out massive waves of Taken. Streetlights and other light stands can provide a safe haven, which the Taken cannot enter, and will regenerate the character's health faster. Otherwise, health regenerates slowly with time, when not taking any damage. In certain sections of the game, it is possible to use a car to traverse between locations in Bright Falls. When in a car, the player can run down Taken on the road, or boost the vehicle's headlights to destroy them.\n\nA major element of gameplay is the optional discovery and collection of manuscript pages from Alan Wake's latest novel—\"Departure\". Although Wake does not remember writing this book, its storyline seems to be becoming real around him. These readable manuscript pages are scattered around the game world, out of chronological order; they often describe scenes that have yet to occur and act as warning and instructions for proceeding through upcoming challenges. Other optional collectibles include coffee thermoses scattered around the game world (100 in all), as well as discovering television sets which show different episodes of the fictional \"Night Springs\" series, radios airing talk and music from Bright Falls' local radio station, and textual signs around the town. The radio shows and signs provide a deeper understanding of the town's history and culture. The game's downloadable content episodes introduce other collectibles such as alarm clocks.\n\nAlan Wake (voiced by Matthew Porretta) is a best-selling psychological thriller author but has been suffering from a two-year stretch of writer's block. He and his wife Alice travel to the small mountain town of Bright Falls in the state of Washington for a short vacation on the advice of Alice and his friend and agent Barry Wheeler. Before arrival, Alan has a nightmare about shadowy figures who tried to harm him before an ethereal figure interrupts his dream and teaches him how to use light to fight the shadows. On their arrival, Alan goes to retrieve the keys and map to their rented cabin from Carl Stucky, the cabin's landlord, but he is visited by a mysterious old woman, who tells him that Stucky had fallen ill and she was entrusted to give Alan the keys. After Alan leaves, Stucky is shown trying to catch up to him and give him the real keys.\n\nAlan and Alice arrive at a cabin on an island in the middle of Cauldron Lake. As they unpack, Alan finds that Alice arranged this trip to try to break his writer's block, scheduling him to see a Bright Falls psychologist named Dr. Hartman and leaving a typewriter in the cabin for him. Alan is infuriated and takes a short walk, but runs back when Alice cries for help. He returns to the cabin just as Alice is being dragged into the lake's waters by a mysterious force. Alan dives into the water after her, blacking out as he submerges.\n\nAlan regains consciousness a week later, apparently having driven his car off the road, but with no memory of how he got there. He starts to head back towards town, but his progress is hampered by shadowy figures that try to kill him. He observes a strange figure in a diving suit who reminds him of his earlier dream and how to fight the shadows with light. Alan fights through the shadows while finding pages of a manuscript titled \"Departure\" with his name on the by-line, a work he had not written. Eventually making it to town, Alan tries to alert Sheriff Sarah Breaker of his wife's disappearance, but Sarah states that there has been no island or cabin in Cauldron Lake for years after it sunk following volcanic eruption years prior. Sarah contacts the FBI to investigate Alice's disappearance, while Alan arranges for Barry to come and help.\n\nAlan receives a call from a man purporting to be Alice's kidnapper, demanding the pages of \"Departure\" in exchange for her. Meeting at a state park, Alan is about to turn over the pages when the man is consumed by a dark tornado and Alan is knocked out. Before being consumed by the tornado, the man revealed that he never had Alice to begin with. He awakes in Barry and Dr. Hartman's care in the lodge overlooking Cauldron Lake. Dr. Hartman listens to Alan's story and claims he is suffering a psychotic break; everything that he's witnessed being part of his imagination. Alan attempts to escape the lodge as the shadowy force starts to attack it; while retrieving the manuscript pages in Dr. Hartman's office, Dr. Hartman tries to stop him and gives the impression that he is aware of the supernatural events surrounding the lake. Barry helps Alan to escape the lodge before the shadow subsumes it and all those inside. Returning to town, they find the FBI has arrived, and attempt to arrest him, before the shadowy forces intervene, allowing Alan and Barry to escape.\n\nAlan and Barry start to learn about the past of Cauldron Lake from other townsfolk. They believe an entity called the Dark Presence is trapped within the lake and is trying to escape by using its powers to turn fiction into reality. It has previously tried this with a writer known as Thomas Zane—the figure in the diving suit—but Zane was able to resist its will and died during the eruption that sank the island. The Dark Presence has grown strong enough to start to influence the townspeople and create the forces that have chased Alan. That night, as Alan and Barry take shelter, they get drunk on moonshine, and Alan starts to recall memories of being forced to write \"Departure\" during the prior week and realizes that the Dark Presence is now trying to use his writings to escape.\n\nSarah and the FBI arrive to arrest the two, but the shadowy figures drag the FBI agent away. Sarah, now convinced of the Dark Presence, helps Alan and Barry to find Cynthia Weaver, a hermit that fears the Dark Presence. She shows them to the \"Well-Lit Room\" and to a weapon that is able to defeat the Dark Presence: the Clicker, a simple light switch that has been infused with the power of Alan's writings. Alan returns to Cauldron Lake alone to face the Dark Presence, using his newfound ability to affect reality with his thoughts aided by the Clicker. The Dark Presence is dispelled but there is no sign of Alice, and Alan believes that to maintain balance, he must give himself to the lake. As Alan sinks below the waters, Alice climbs safely out of the lake. Within the depths of the lake, Alan finds himself in the cabin and realizes that \"Departure\" is not yet finished, and turns back to the typewriter to continue the story and write his own means to be free of the lake. He comments to himself that \"It's not a lake—\"it's an ocean.\"\"\n\nContinuing from the end of the main game, Alan finds himself in a surreal version of Bright Falls and realizes he is being held in Cauldron Lake. Zane directs Alan to follow a signal through a cell phone to focus and guide himself out of \"the Dark Place\", the realm where the Dark Presence came from and where the written word can become reality. As Alan continues to avoid and defeat various Taken, he encounters several television screens that show a more maniacal version of Alan, ranting about upcoming events, forewarning Alan of what is to come. He also encounters an ethereal version of Barry, a figment of his subconsciousness, who also helps to guide Alan safely across the abstract landscape.\n\nZane's signal leads Alan to a sawmill, but as he explores it, he finds himself back in a setting of his city apartment. Zane appears, and tells Alan that it is \"himself\"—the maniacal figure on the televisions—that is keeping him in the Dark Place. Alan refuses to believe that he is trapping himself, but soon faces a monstrosity of several televisions, with the irrational Alan on them that tries to kill him. Alan is able to defeat the crazed version of himself, waking up back at the cabin in the lake, and realizes that he is still trapped.\n\nStill trapped in the Dark Place, Alan regains consciousness to find his memories of Bright Falls emerging; after leaving an amalgamation of the Cauldron Lake Lodge and the Andersons' farm, Zane tells Alan he must make his way back to the cabin via a lighthouse. The environments start to become exceedingly surreal and Alan follows Zane's path, avoiding increasing numbers of Taken. Zane warns Alan that the \"irrational Alan\" is still inside the cabin, controlling the Dark Place, while he himself represents the rational part of Alan; the rational Alan must regain control of the dream in order to have any chance of escaping the Dark Place. The irrational side of Alan attempts to stop him by creating delusions of Alice, extinguishing the lighthouse's light, and sending armies of Taken after him, but with Zane's help, Alan eventually reaches his goal, passing through the lighthouse to reach the cabin.\n\nAs he nears the cabin, the imaginary Barry appears and tells Alan that he will have to reject all the illusions before he can face off against the insane version of Alan, including the apparition of Barry. Alan is ready to accept that, forcing Alan to fight Taken illusions of Dr. Hartman, Barry, and the Andersons, defeating them all before he is able to reenter the cabin. His crazed side is in a paranoid state on the cabin floor, and when Alan touches him, the two are made whole again. Alan realizes that he cannot let himself fall into a delusional state again for fear of never being able to escape, and returns to the typewriter to start a new story—\"Return\".\n\nThe Finnish studio Remedy Entertainment is known for creating the critically acclaimed \"Max Payne\" (2001), and its sequel, \"\" (2003). After shipping \"Max Payne 2\", Remedy Entertainment spent some time \"recovering from the crunch\", and started coming up with different concepts for a new project. Among these was the concept for \"Alan Wake\".\n\nThe game was announced at the 2005 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) for \"the next generation of consoles and PCs\", and was shown to the press behind closed doors in the form of a tech demo. In 2006, Remedy partnered with Microsoft Game Studios to publish the game exclusively for Microsoft's Xbox 360 video game console and then-current Windows Vista PC operating system. The first screenshots depicted the character of Alan Wake in much different attire, as well as a different layout for the town of Bright Falls, compared to the released game.\n\nAll the characters featured in \"Alan Wake\" were based on real life models. Ilkka Villi and Jonna Järvenpää, the models for Alan and Alice Wake, respectively, are the only Finnish models in the game; all other models were American. Voice overs were provided by native actors from Japan and America for their respective regions.\n\nAfter four years of having repeatedly demonstrated the Microsoft Windows version, in 2009, Remedy confirmed that at that point the game was being developed exclusively for the Xbox 360 and the decision to make a PC version was in Microsoft's hands. After the game's release in 2010, Remedy said that bringing the game to the PC was \"not on the cards at the moment.\" However, nearly two years after its release, Remedy was able to secure the rights to publish a PC version.\n\nThe game was announced as \"done\" and undergoing final polishing in August 2009. The game eventually went gold on 7 April 2010, and was released in May.\n\nOriginally, Remedy planned Bright Falls as a free-roaming, sandbox-style open world city, similar to those seen in the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series. After trying this idea for six months, the team decided to scrap it, because it interfered with the pacing and storytelling they intended to deliver in a thriller game.\n\nThe game's enemies were designed by drawing concept art and then pouring water over them to make them feel \"Just a bit off\". For the character of Alan Wake himself, Remedy used \"concept photos\" as opposed to more traditional concept artwork. To research the Pacific Northwest setting for the game, a Remedy team travelled to the area, and produced a large amount of photographs and videos.\n\n\"Alan Wake\" was influenced by and often alludes to certain films, TV shows, and books, as well as paying homage to a number of artists and works. Remedy has explained the shared themes and ideas between the game and other existing works of popular culture as \"taking something familiar to people as an element, and building something of your own, and hopefully something [that is] unique in games, but still familiar from other forms of entertainment.\"\n\nBestselling author Stephen King was a major inspiration for \"Alan Wake\". The main character as a writer whose work is coming true is a theme that has been explored by King in a number of his works. Wake's narration directly alludes to King on several occasions, including the game's opening line, in which he quotes a Stephen King essay. The game also pays homage to the film \"The Shining\" (based on King's novel of the same name) with a hedge maze area similar to the iconic maze in the film, among other references, as well as King's novel Christine, with one of the in-game cars resembling her. King himself was asked for permission to use his quote. He also received copies of the game as a \"thank you\", but was unable to try them out because he does not own an Xbox. In addition to King's work, Lake has cited the stories of Bret Easton Ellis and Neil Gaiman as influences, as well as Mark Z. Danielewski's \"House of Leaves\".\n\nThe game's setting, Bright Falls, draws inspiration from the early 1990s TV show \"Twin Peaks\", which was set in the titular town; both fictional small towns in the state of Washington. Alfred Hitchcock is also cited as an inspiration, with the flocks of birds that often attack the protagonist being influenced by his classic horror film \"The Birds\".\n\nIn the game there are a number of television sets that can be found around the town in different places. They can be switched on and a short episode of the fictional series \"Night Springs\" will be played, which is influenced by the television series \"The Twilight Zone\", created by Rod Serling in the late 1950s.\n\nIn its structure, the story of \"Alan Wake\" plays out similarly to a mystery television program, where each episode brings another piece of the puzzle to the main ongoing story, yet have a distinct plot of their own. As such, \"Alan Wake\" is organised into episodes, which include narrative and plot devices normally used in TV, such as cliffhangers at the end of the episodes. A prominent borrowing from television is the \"Previously on \"Alan Wake\"...\" recap sequence that opens each episode, and serve to \"refresh the player's memory and point to things that will become relevant shortly.\" A different song plays at the end of every episode, imitating certain TV shows that feature different music during each episode's closing credits.\n\nThe main game itself is divided up into six episodes. Additionally, two \"special features\", titled \"The Signal\" and \"The Writer\", have been released as downloadable content (DLC). Together, \"Alan Wake\" and its DLCs constitute the \"first season\" of a bigger story. The main game is designed to have a satisfactory ending with the main character reaching his goal, while the DLCs form a two-part special that further expands on the game's story by \"[continuing] the fiction and [serving] as a bridge between seasons.\" While the game's developers have expressed interest in following \"Alan Wake\" up with a season two (i.e., a sequel), no plans have been announced about this.\n\nRemedy Entertainment chose the TV series storytelling format to establish a certain stylisation and pacing. The developers felt that watching episodes of certain TV shows – such as the heavily serialised series \"Lost\" – in the form of released box sets, at the viewers' pace, was a \"natural way of 'consuming media'\", and that this episodic format was a better fit for a long game. Remedy lauded \"Lost\" for its pacing as a thriller TV show.\n\nA number of real-life brands and products appear in \"Alan Wake\". The game's developers have expressed that they tried to \"be very conservative and attentive towards gamers\" with their use of product placement, and that they aimed \"to make the world feel more real rather than put ads in-your-face.\"\n\nExamples of such marketing include collectable Energizer batteries and lithium batteries to insert into the player's hand-held lights. The phone service provider Verizon Wireless is another prominent brand in \"Alan Wake\": besides Verizon branded mobile phones appearing on screen, there is a 30-second Verizon commercial viewable on one of the game's interactive TVs, as well as an allusion to the company's famous advertising line \"Can you hear me now?\" during a phone conversation in \"The Signal\" DLC. Additionally, billboards around Bright Falls advertise both Energizer and Verizon. Ford and Lincoln automobiles are also featured in the game.\n\nSeveral Microsoft related brands also appear in the game. Alan and Alice Wake's car shows that it has the Microsoft-powered Ford Sync in-vehicle entertainment system. An Xbox 360 console can be seen in one section of the game, with the box of the fictional \"Night Springs\" video game next to it, which are collectibles in \"The Writer\" DLC episode. In multiple sections of the game, Microsoft Tag bar codes can be seen; these can be scanned in real life by the user with the appropriate software on their mobile device. When scanned, these tags redirect players to a phone number with the voicemail from one of the game's character, or to a Verizon-sponsored web site where users gain access to exclusive \"Alan Wake\" extras for their console. This functionality is only available in the United States.\n\nThe game's score is composed by Petri Alanko. The soundtrack features the song \"War\" by Poets of the Fall, from the band's fourth studio album, \"Twilight Theater\". Sam Lake said that the song \"...is a prominent part of the \"Alan Wake\" soundtrack and the theme also links strongly to the game's storyline.\" Poets of the Fall also perform two original songs, \"Children of the Elder God\" and \"The Poet and the Muse\", under the name Old Gods of Asgard. The band wrote the ending theme to Remedy's previous game, \"\", called \"Late Goodbye\", which is based on a poem written by Lake. \"War\", however, was not written specifically for \"Alan Wake\". \"Haunted\" by Poe plays at the end of the second episode. \"Space Oddity\" by David Bowie plays over the end credits. Anomie Belle's \"How Can I Be Sure\" is featured in the third episode. \"Coconut\" by Harry Nilsson is played several times during game. On 20 July 2010 an official soundtrack consisting of 18 tracks was released.\n\nDuring production, \"Lovely Head\" by Goldfrapp, \"Dear Darkness\" by PJ Harvey and \"Lilac Wine\" by Jeff Buckley were also considered for episode 2. For episode 3, \"Sea of Love\" and \"Don't Go into That Barn\" by Tom Waits, as well as The Verve's \"Sit and Wonder\" and \"Wake Up\" by Arcade Fire were possible choices.\n\n\"Alan Wake\" was first released exclusively for the Xbox 360 video game console. The game was scheduled to be released on 18 May 2010 in North America, and on 21 May in Europe. When the game went gold on 7 April 2010, the European release date was moved up a week. Therefore, the game was released in Europe first, on 14 May 2010, and then in North America on 18 May, as originally scheduled. On 23 November 2010, \"Alan Wake\" was released on the Games on Demand service of Xbox Live. On 16 February 2012, a version of the game for Microsoft Windows was released.\n\n\"Alan Wake\" was also released in a limited collector's edition, packaged in a case resembling a hardcover book. The collector's edition contains the game, a book titled \"The Alan Wake Files\", and an exclusive soundtrack CD. It also features a developer commentary, and lends access to virtual items for Xbox 360, such as themes and Avatar clothes.\n\nDespite the cancellation of the PC version at the same time as the Xbox 360 release as a result of Microsoft's decision, Remedy's Oskari Häkkinen stated that \"PC gaming is part of Remedy's heritage\" and that the developers still wanted to release a PC version of the game. Remedy continued pressing Microsoft to allow the creation of a PC version, eventually gaining it in mid-2011; Häkkinen attributed Microsoft's agreement partially to their repeated requests, but as well as Remedy's good standing with Microsoft, and the time factor, having the PC version be available ahead of \"American Nightmare\". Development of the PC version began in earnest, with a small team from Remedy working with Finnish independent developer Nitro Games. Instead of starting from the scrapped PC version, the team worked from the Xbox 360 code and added in new features to take advantage of more powerful elements on modern PC machines. Core to the PC version was to make sure that the game played well using typical keyboard and mouse controls in addition to a controller, and to assure the graphics exceeded the limitations of the Xbox 360; Matias Myllyrinne, Remedy's CEO, stated that these elements were important, as \"If this is not tuned to perfection, all the visuals are lost and the emotional touchstones are missed\". The PC version was completed in about five months, and the game formally announced to the public in December 2011.\n\nThe game, which includes the main game and both DLC chapters, was released on the Steam platform on 16 February 2012. Within 48 hours, Remedy announced that revenue from sale of this version surpassed their development and marketing costs for the game. A retail PC version, distributed by Nordic Games, was released on 2 March 2012, in both a regular edition and a Collector's edition, containing a soundtrack disc, \"The Alan Wake Files\", and other special content. The PC retail release for the United States was released on 24 April 2012, being distributed by Legacy Interactive.\n\nIn December 2013, Remedy and Xbox released a special collector's edition of the hit horror game, loaded with new content on the disc, including a 44-page digital comic book with art by Gerry Kissell and Amin Amat, and written by Remedy Entertainment's Mikko Rautalahti, who also wrote the script for the video game.\n\nA promotional live-action tie-in web series/miniseries titled \"Bright Falls\" was made available a few weeks before the game's release on the web and the Xbox Live service. The six episodes of \"Bright Falls\" were co-written and directed by Phillip Van, and they serve as a prequel to the game, set in the eponymous town before Alan Wake arrives there. The main character in the series is Jake Fischer (played by Christopher Forsyth), a newspaper reporter who visits the town on business.\n\nA number of characters are shared between \"Bright Falls\" and \"Alan Wake\", including diner waitress Rose, Dr. Emil Hartman, radio host Pat Maine and Alan Wake himself, who appears briefly in the final episode. The actors who play these characters also serve as voice actors and physical models for the characters in the game.\n\nThe web series begins as Jake Fischer arrives in Bright Falls to interview Dr. Hartman on his new book, an assignment from his publication agency. After a series of encounters with local townspeople, Jake soon finds himself the victim of long periods of lost time and black outs. He finds himself waking up in the middle of a forest and other locations where he had not been previously. He also develops an aversion towards lights and daytime. The longer he stays in Bright Falls, the more violent his behaviour becomes. When he realises this, he tries to duct-tape himself to a refrigerator and recording videotape himself in his sleep to see what might be causing the behaviour. It is implied that he is being completely taken over by the Dark Presence, to the point of murdering several people. He then vanishes, just before the arrival of Alan and Alice Wake.\n\nDuring 2010, two \"special feature\" episodes of \"Alan Wake\" were developed and released as downloadable content (DLC) on the Xbox Live service, which serve to bridge the gap between the game's ending, and a possible sequel.\n\nThe first of the two, titled \"The Signal\", was released on 27 July 2010. David Houghton of GamesRadar+ said it was one of the best segments of the game, but worried that it made the main game feel comparatively less impressive.\n\nThe second episode, \"The Writer\", was released on 12 October 2010. Erik Brudvig of IGN called it a must-buy for anyone that already purchased \"The Signal\", and said it satisfyingly closed out the game's story. He did feel that both DLCs were pricey for the amount of content they provided.\n\nThe limited collector's edition of the game includes a 144-page book called \"The Alan Wake Files\", which expands on the fiction of the game. A novelisation of \"Alan Wake\" was written by Rick Burroughs. An art/making of book, entitled \"Alan Wake: Illuminated\" is also available.\n\n\"Alan Wake\" received positive reviews. Michael Plant from \"The Independent\" gave the game a score of 5/5. He praised \"Alan Wake\" for its \"flawless pacing\", which \"ensures a compulsive experience\". The editing and plot were also received very positively, making the game \"the kind of experience the current console generation was made for.\"\n\n\"The Daily Telegraph\" rated the game 9/10 with editor Nick Cowen being impressed by its \"stunning\" look, stating the town of Bright Falls and its surrounding environment to be \"authentic\" in terms of architecture, vegetation, weather and lighting. He described the atmosphere as being able to \"...turn on a dime from feeling safe and serene to one of choking menace and foreboding...\". Combat mechanics and plot were also praised with the first making \"the player feel constantly under threat.\" and the latter being described as one of the game's \"strongest assets\". Criticism included the quality of the facial animation and the relatively short length of the game.\n\nDirk Lammers said the game kept \"players on the edge of their seats\", giving a final score of 4 out of 4 in his review for the Associated Press. Matt Greenop from \"The New Zealand Herald\" rated the game 5/5 and praised the game's \"excellent pace\" due to its episodic format. He also praised the \"chilling\" storyline, \"brilliant environments\" and concluded the game to be \"one of the most innovative and entertaining titles so far this year.\" William Vitka from the \"New York Post\" graded it B+, praising the game for its \"scary atmosphere\", music, graphics and \"surprising level of complexity\" in combat, but commented negatively on the game's animation and storyline.\n\nBrian Crecente, editor-in-chief of Kotaku, praised the general use of light as a gameplay-mechanic. He commented on the episodic structure, saying it made the player feel satisfied even after short gameplay sessions. He also praised the overall storyline, having played the final episode thrice in a row, saying: \"For the first time in my life, I have experienced something that plays like a game but has the impact of a movie... Alan Wake is a powerful ride, an experience bound to leave you thinking about it and wanting more for days after its completion.\" He criticised the game for not providing enough information about Wake and his wife, despite being \"packed with memorable people\", but concluded that the game \"redefines interactive storytelling\".\n\nTom McShea criticised the game for lacking \"surprising, memorable gameplay moments\" in his review for GameSpot, but hailed it for its \"fresh\" story-telling, great original as well as licensed music, \"subtle\" lighting effects, which, along with the soundtrack, \"create a disturbing atmosphere\", \"satisfying\" combat system and \"clever\" inclusion of collectibles, giving a final score of 8.5/10.\n\nIGN's Charles Onyett scored the game 9/10, providing it with the \"Editors' Choice Award\". He described it as \"hard to put down once you have started\", and appreciated the game for its episodic structure, \"interesting\" story-telling mechanic, lighting effects, soundtrack and combat system, which he described as \"fast and responsive\", but criticised the writing as \"uneven\". The game received high marks for its \"strong atmosphere\", \"fun gameplay\", and \"great visuals\", but lost some due to its \"weak ending\".\n\nTom Orry from VideoGamer.com also awarded a score of 9/10, praising the game for its \"clever narrative\", \"incredible atmosphere\" and soundtrack which he described as \"one of the best and most memorable I've ever heard in a video game\". GameTrailers gave the game an 8.6/10. The review praised the game's presentation for \"selling you completely on its twisted nightmare\", and providing a \"genuine sense of dread\". Eurogamer's Ellie Gibson awarded a score of 7/10, stating that although she did not consider the game to be very original, she found it accessible and undemanding, with a \"neat combat mechanic\".\n\nChris Kohler from Wired magazine was more critical and gave it 6/10, saying \"when presented with an infinite number of possible resolutions, any answer is going to feel arbitrary. Alan Wake starts strong but finishes weak. Neither the gameplay nor the story deliver on their potential by the time the credits roll\". Kohler, however, praised main character, certain gameplay decisions and \"unique story\".\n\n\"Alan Wake\" has received a number of nominations and awards for its achievements in video gaming in 2010. Editors of \"Time\" magazine rendered \"Alan Wake\" the best video game of 2010. In its Best Xbox 360 Games of 2010 list, IGN awarded \"Alan Wake\" \"Best Horror Game\", and also nominated it for \"Best Story,\" \"Coolest Atmosphere,\" \"Most Innovative Gameplay,\" and \"Best Character\" (for the character of Alan Wake). The game was nominated in the \"Best Xbox 360 Game\" category at the 2010 Spike Video Game Awards, and received three nominations at the 2nd Annual Inside Gaming Awards in the categories \"Best Narrative,\" \"Best Sound Design\" and \"Most Compelling Character\" (for Alan Wake). GameSpot's Best Games of 2010 Awards featured seven nominations for the game, including \"Best Story\" and \"Best Writing/Dialogue,\" and won the reader's choice award for \"Best Original IP.\" IGN ranked it No. 61 in their \"Top Modern Games\" ranking.\n\nThe game's soundtrack has won Best Score – European at the 2010 Annual Game Music Awards, with the panel stating \"Breaking composer Petri Alanko's expansive score for the critically acclaimed Alan Wake captured the hearts of gamers and stand-alone listeners alike with its intimate orchestrations and psychological explorations.\"\n\nNPD Group stated sales for the first two weeks reached 145,000 units. According to a report, \"Alan Wake\" is the second most illegally copied Xbox 360 game of 2010, with more than 1.1 million downloads. It includes an amusing feature where if \"pirated\", the character wears an eye patch during the game. According to a report by IndustryGamers, sales of \"Alan Wake\" would be much higher than previously estimated, at around 1.4 million, as of December 2011. This includes the digital sales of the game during the Xbox 360 2011 Holiday bundle, which included a token to download \"Alan Wake\", as well as a retail copy of \"Forza Motorsport 3\".\n\nOn 13 March 2012 Remedy Entertainment announced that the game has passed 2 million copies sold, including Xbox 360 and PC. On 23 May 2013 Remedy creative director Sam Lake announced that the game and its standalone follow up had sold 3 million copies. On 25 March 2015 Remedy's CEO Matias Myllyrinne tweeted that the franchise had sold over 4.5 million units. The following month a Polygon story on the game's prototype for a sequel mentioned that \"Alan Wake\" had sold more than 3.2 million copies.\n\nDue to expiring music licenses, all digital and retail versions of \"Alan Wake\" were pulled from purchase from the various storefronts as of 15 May 2017, though Remedy offered a large discount for the title in the days prior to removal. The removal does not affect those who already own the game, nor does it impact the availability of \"Alan Wake's American Nightmare\", though that title will likely be affected similarly when its own licensing deals expire. \n\nHowever, by October 2018, Remedy had been able to rework the music licensing details with Microsoft's help, and the game was made available again on Windows storefronts, with the original music tracks. Remedy is currently working to also secure the rights for the Xbox platform in the near future.\n\nAt \"Alan Wake\"s release, Remedy had intended for a sequel; developer Oskari Häkkinen stated that Remedy saw the game as \"Season 1\" and its DLC was to \"bridge the gap to what we're working towards.\" Häkkinen stated they were not directly working on a sequel at that time, as Microsoft had focused them to complete the DLC. Writer Mikko Rautalahti adds the story is \"bigger than one game\" and the sequel would be \"weird and wonderful\".\n\nIn May 2011, leaked information led to Remedy confirming they were working on a new \"Alan Wake\" project, but affirmed it was not a full sequel. This was ultimately revealed to be \"Alan Wake's American Nightmare\", a short standalone game released in 2012 that follows Alan's adventures after the first game that they wanted to release on the Xbox Live Arcade platform. The Remedy team had looked at a project borrowing from zombie and monster films like \"From Dusk till Dawn\", and wanted to create more of a sandbox mode for players to fight off waves of enemies (which became the game's Arcade mode, \"Fight Till Dawn\"); they then worked these elements into Alan's story, keeping the theme of \"The Twilight Zone\" to progress the story. \n\nIn May 2013, a new game by Remedy was announced at the Xbox One event called \"Quantum Break\", before explaining the following day that a sequel to \"Alan Wake\" had been postponed. Despite their love of the property and initially beginning work on a sequel, \"Alan Wake\" was not financially successful enough to receive the funding they needed to continue developing the sequel at the time. In April 2015, Polygon published an article describing the development process of \"Alan Wake 2\" that started shortly after the first game released. \"Alan Wake 2\" already had a working prototype and Remedy was prepared to pitch the game to Microsoft. However, according to Sam Lake, Remedy's founder, Microsoft wanted something else and development of the sequel has shifted to \"Quantum Break. \"Most of the ideas for \"Alan Wake 2 \"were implemented on \"American Nightmare\", like the game's location, the Arizona Desert, and the concept of Taken enemies with special abilities.\n\nIn July 2018, Remedy CEO Telo Virtala made an interview for GamesIndustry.biz and revealed that Alan Wake will not be planned without Microsoft Studios' approval (since it was their intellectual property). Virtala stated: \"Considering our history... Alan Wake was really interesting but it was a collaboration with Microsoft. Due to certain reasons, it never got a sequel. Quantum Break, also, we put a lot of effort into creating the world, the characters, the stories, but still it was Microsoft IP. They decided not to take it further.\"\n\nIn September 2018, Remedy Entertainment and Contradiction Films announced plans to develop a live-action \"Alan Wake\" series, with Peter Calloway as the showrunner and Remedy's Sam Lake as executive producer. Contradiction Film's Tomas Harlan had seen \"Alan Wake\"s potential as a television series, in part that the game was constructed in episodic chapters and presented in a linear fashion, and had spoken to Lake about it several times, and in 2018 began to start on a firm planning process, which including bringing Calloway on board during the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2018. The show plans to use concepts from the scrapped \"Alan Wake 2\", as well as building upon what the first game and \"American Nightmare\" provided; Harlan does not expect the series to be in lock-step with the game and while Alan Wake would be the central character of the show, they would spend more time developing his companions from the game. The group plans to shop the show around to networks in October.\n\n"}

Produced by Hallmark Entertainment, it stars Leonor Varela as the Egyptian queen Cleopatra, Timothy Dalton as Julius Caesar, Billy Zane as Mark Antony, Rupert Graves as Octavius, Sean Pertwee as Brutus and Bruce Payne as Cassius. \"Cleopatra\" was shown first on the ABC television network in two parts on two consecutive evenings in May 1999 and then released on videotape and DVD.\n\nThe film begins in Alexandria with Cleopatra VII, Egypt's rightful Queen, in exile, while her sister Arsinoe and brother, Ptolemy have stolen the throne. Roman general Julius Caesar comes to collect Egypt's tax debt. After conversing with a courtesan, Cleopatra smuggles herself into the palace wrapped in a carpet; a gift from her to Caesar. He accepts the gift and the young queen is revealed to Caesar. The two spend the night together, and the next morning, Cleopatra and Ptolemy are betrothed to marry by Caesar. Shortly after the siblings are wed, Cleopatra is proclaimed Queen of Egypt, forcing Ptolemy to join forces with Arsinoe and drive their sister out of Alexandria.\n\nA war breaks out between the Romans and Ptolemy's Egyptian forces, and in the process, Alexandria's great library is burned to the ground. Even with this loss, Cleopatra soon celebrates the return of her Roman lover, the death of her brother, and the capture of her traitor sister. The two take a 2-month journey down the Nile aboard one of the Queen's elegant ships. Upon their return, Caesar breaks the news that he must leave for Rome. Unbeknownst to him, Caesar leaves Cleopatra pregnant with his child. A son is born to the queen roughly nine months later; he is named Caesarion, in honor of his father.\n\nBack in Rome, believing that he should hold the same status as his Egyptian lover, Caesar demands he be declared King of Rome. Although they are hesitant to do so, the senate eventually grants Caesar's request. Now having been declared king, Caesar invites Cleopatra to stay at one of his villas, just outside Rome. With her, she brings the couple's infant son. In front of his people (including wife Calpurnia), Cleopatra declares that Caesar is her son's father, publicly forcing his hand, and demanding that her son be allowed to rule both Egypt and Rome invoking the consternation of Brutus and Cassius.\n\nAlthough he accepts Caesarion as his child, Caesar denies the queen's request, explaining that Egypt is only free from Rome because he wishes it to be. Just before her return to Egypt, Cleopatra soon learns that Caesar has been assassinated at the hands of Brutus, Cassius and other senators. The burdens of ruling fall on the shoulders of Caesar's Roman heir and nephew, Octavian. Mark Antony declares revenge and begins a war against Brutus and Cassius. In the process, both Cassius and Brutus commit suicide.\n\nIn spending time with together, Antony and Cleopatra fall in love. Although they wish to marry, Antony marries Octavian's sister, Octavia, in order to strengthen his alliance and co-ruling with the new emperor. Defying his Roman beliefs against polygamy, Antony marries Cleopatra in Antioch, claiming that her son, Caesarion, is heir to not only Egypt, but also Rome.\n\nUpon hearing of Antony's claim, Octavian wages war against the two lovers, trapping Cleopatra in her own city. Antony army is overwhelmed by Octavian's army. Antony returns with his defeated soldiers, badly wounded and soon dies of his injuries. Cleopatra is devastated. \n\nOctavian arrives in Egypt, demanding that Cleopatra join him in Rome as his prisoner. She agrees and askes that her son be allowed to rule Egypt. Octavian refuses, but allows Antony to have an Egyptian burial.\n\nAfter sending her son to India, Cleopatra's lets an Egyptian asp bite her, and dies shortly after. Her handmaidens quickly follow their queen's example. \n\nOctavian's men break through the doors, only to discover that the queen is dead. Octavian approaches Cleopatra and finds that she is dead.

{"id": "2104142", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2104142", "title": "Comparison between Esperanto and Interlingua", "text": "Comparison between Esperanto and Interlingua\n\nEsperanto and Interlingua are two planned languages which have taken radically different approaches to the problem of providing an International auxiliary language (IAL).\n\nAlthough they are both classed as IALs, the intellectual bases of Esperanto and Interlingua are quite different. It has been argued that each language is a successful implementation of a particular IAL model. However, in both language communities there is a polemical tradition of using external criteria to critique the perceived opponent language (that is, judging Interlingua by Esperantist criteria and vice versa). In practical use, moreover, language usage in the two communities has sometimes shown convergences despite divergent theory.\n\nOne cannot ascribe a single outlook to all Esperantists or all Interlinguists; however, the contrasting views of L. L. Zamenhof and Alexander Gode remain influential among Esperantists and Interlinguists, respectively. Zamenhof, the inventor of Esperanto, was motivated by several strands of nineteenth-century idealism, ranging from Comtean positivism to utopian internationalism. Esperanto, in his view, was a theoretically neutral instrument for communication, which could serve as a vehicle for idealistic values, initially Zamenhof's philosophy of \"homaranismo\", later the \"interna ideo\" (internal idea) of achieving \"fraternity and justice among all people\" (Zamenhof) through the adoption of Esperanto. Among later Esperantists, this philosophy has tended to reinforce a set of propositions about the language:\n\n\nBy the mid-twentieth century, when Gode led the development of Interlingua, the ideals underlying Esperanto had come to seem naive. Influenced by Herder, Gode propounded a Romantic, anti-positivist view of language: languages are an aspect of the culture of a people, not an instrument to achieve a goal; an ideology cannot be attached to a language, except artificially. This implied, in his view, that a world language on the Esperanto model was either impossible or, worse, achievable only through totalitarian coercion. He was of the opinion that, unless imposed by force, a universal global language would presuppose a universal global culture, which does not currently exist and is not necessarily desirable.\n\nOn the other hand, Gode saw another sort of international language—non-universal and non-culturally neutral—as being entirely possible.\n\nEsperanto and Interlingua are fundamentally different in their purposes. Whereas Esperanto is meant to be an international second language able to be fluently learned by speakers of any language, Interlingua is directed more toward European languages, especially its control languages. Though Esperanto may be more neutral as well as easier to master, Esperantists can usually communicate only with other Esperantists, though the language is at least somewhat incomprehensible to many who have not studied it; Interlingua, however, is intended to be understood to some extent by a speaker of any Romance language, because many words in Interlingua resemble their originals in Latin, the precursor to all Romance languages.\n\nThe vocabulary of both languages is taken largely from Romance, Germanic and Slavic languages; most of these words are derived from Latin. Depending on their international form, Germanic and Slavic words in Interlingua may be Latinized; for example, English \"blockade\", German \"Blockade\", Russian \"блокада\" → Interlingua \"blocada\". By comparison, all words in Esperanto take on a characteristic Esperanto form. In this case, the Interlingua \"blocada\" and the Esperanto \"blokado\" are nearly identical and equally neutral.\n\nThough both Esperanto and Interlingua borrow primarily from European languages, they also borrow words from other languages which have become widespread. Two different philosophies have led to two different approaches. Interlingua highly regards etymological fidelity, thus it usually adopts the word that is the \"nearest common ancestor\" of the respective words in at least three source language units (considering Spanish and Portuguese together as one unit). Esperanto highly regards regularity, thus it disregards the form of the word in European languages to make it match Esperanto's morphology and phonemic orthography. For example, Interlingua has \"geisha\" (from Japanese 芸者), \"sheik\" (from Arabic شيخ), and \"kayak\" (from Inuit ᖃᔭᖅ); in Esperanto, these words are written \"gejŝo\", \"ŝejko\", and \"kajako\".\nIn Esperanto, to form a new word, it is generally preferred to compound two or more existing roots than to borrow a word from another language. This is recommended in order to keep the number of \"primitive\" roots low and thus to maintain its learnability. Interlingua does not have that as a design aim, thus most of its compound and \"primitive\" (non-compound) words also exist in its source languages.\n\nBoth languages have a highly regular grammar without difficult conjugations or declensions. However, Interlingua lacks adjective agreement and case endings, which make its noun and adjective morphology simpler.\n\nInterlingua draws its roots from certain \"control languages\": French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, English, German and Russian. It uses these languages as a means to select the words most used in these major European languages. Esperanto draws from largely the same languages, but uses agglutination more extensively. Rather than using an existing word commonly used among the major European languages, Esperanto forms its own words using its own roots. For example, the Esperanto word for \"hospital\" is mal·san·ul·ej·o, which breaks down into five roots: mal (opposite), san (health), ul (person), ej (place), o (noun). Interlingua tends to use words derived from natural languages instead of extensive agglutination.\n\nThe following table illustrates the difference between Esperanto and Interlingua with regards to word formation:\n\nTo the reader who speaks English or a Romance language, the words in the Interlingua column are more likely to appear recognizable. However, speakers of languages that do not have words related to those in the Interlingua column must learn the Interlingua words one at a time; the Esperanto words, however, would be simple to use because of its system of word derivation. This point underlines the fundamental differences between Esperanto and Interlingua: the latter was designed to be easily \"understood\" by speakers of European languages, whereas the former was designed for people to learn to \"speak\" more easily. (Interlingua does have, however, a more regular system of word derivation than many natural languages.)\n\nOften, the European words on which Interlingua is based gain extensive currency in non-Western languages. \"Hospital\", for example, appears in Celtic languages such as Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Manx, and Breton; Germanic languages such as Dutch, Danish and Afrikaans; Slavic languages such as Ukrainian and Polish; Indo-Aryan languages such as Hindi, Urdu and Bengali; Altaic languages such as Mongolian, Turkmen and Azerbaijani; Austronesian languages such as Indonesian, Ilocano, Tagalog, Tetum and Chamorro; African languages such as Swahili, Kongo and Setswana; and creoles and linguistically isolated languages such as Papiamento, Albanian, Mapunzugun and Basque. In many other languages, however, the word \"hospital\" is not found, including Finnish, Arabic, Hebrew, Vietnamese and Hungarian.\n\nBoth languages attempt to be as precise as possible; that is, each strives to reflect differences in meaning using different words. The Esperanto compound \"mal-san-ul-ej-o\", literally \"un-healthy-person-place-noun\", implies a place for people who are unhealthy. The word means \"hospital\", but the compound could be construed as any place where an unhealthy person is. Interlingua's non-compound word, though possibly less neutral, thus avoids any misunderstanding. (Depending on the speaker and audience, Esperanto could also use a different word for \"hospital\", such as \"hospitalo\", \"kliniko\", \"lazareto\", \"preventorio\" or \"sanatorio\".)\n\nInterlingua and Esperanto have minor differences regarding precisely how agglutinations occur. For example, Interlingua adds tense endings to the indicative form of a verb (dona → donar), while Esperanto adds them to the stem (don- → doni).\n\nThe orthography of Esperanto is inspired by the Latin alphabets of Slavic languages, and is almost completely phonemic (one sound, one letter). Interlingua, by contrast, uses an orthography established by its Romance, Germanic, and Slavic source languages. Thus, the orthography of Interlingua is much more broad-based than that of Esperanto. The procedure used sometimes favored English and the Romance languages, however, resulting in a little less phonemicity and a little more familiarity to speakers of those languages.\n\nFor example, the Esperanto \"kontakto\" and the Interlingua \"contacto\" mean the same thing and are pronounced the same, but are written differently, because the orthography of Esperanto is simpler: one sound, one letter. Interlingua occasionally departs from this rule, chiefly because the letters \"c\" and \"g\" have hard and soft sounds. Such details make Interlingua more difficult to learn and speak for people who are unfamiliar with English and the Romance languages, but at the same time easier to read and understand for speakers of Romance or Romance-influenced languages: the letters show the history of the Romance influence. The difference, however, is minimal.\n\nThe use of diacritics in Esperanto historically made it more difficult to type on standard typewriters and older computers; since support for Unicode has become widespread, this is less of an issue, but still may require some setup tweaks for users who don't otherwise use a language with diacritics. Alternately, a widely accepted standard is to signify the letters with diacritics by simply typing the letter \"x,\" which is not part of its alphabet, after the affected letter. On the other hand, Interlingua uses only the basic Latin alphabet, with no diacritics.\n\nSupporters of Interlingua note that their language not only conserves the natural aspect of Western languages, but also their rich, subtle treasury of meanings. Interlingua flows regularly from its Romance, Germanic, and Slavic source languages, and thus it possesses their expressiveness.\n\nEsperanto supporters contend that, by its liberal use of affixes and its flexible word-order, is equally as expressive as Interlingua or indeed any natural language, but is more internationally neutral. While acknowledging that Esperanto is a product of rational construction, not historical evolution, they argue that, after the prolonged usage of more than 100 years, it too has become a living human language.\n\nAlthough no census has ever been undertaken, Esperanto speakers frequently place their numbers at somewhere between 100,000 and 3 million speakers. The number of Interlingua speakers is generally estimated between a few hundred and 1,500. Esperanto is the only constructed language with native speakers, numbering 200-2000 according to \"Ethnologue\".\n\n\n"}

The story had an \"out of universe\" component in that the outcomes of primary battles were determined by readers voting.\n\nNumerous smaller, story-driven skirmishes occur throughout the series, not counted with the primary duels meant to determine the outcome between the brothers.\n\nThere were eleven battles fought between the two universes:\n\nAlthough the fight ends with the apparent \"victory\" of Marvel, the new entity of Access, a being capable of traversing the two universes, infuses Batman and Captain America with fragments of the true universes before the Spectre and the Living Tribunal attempt to create a compromise by fusing the two universes together. This resulted in the publication of the twelve-issue \"Amalgam\" universe, which sees various amalgamated versions of the heroes and villains acting as though they have been in existence for years.\n\nAccess is eventually able to find Dark Claw and Super-Soldier - versions of Batman and Captain America who have been 'amalgamated' with Wolverine and Superman respectively - and use the essence of the original universe in them to return the universes to normal. As the Brothers engage in direct battle, the Spectre and the Living Tribunal attempt to stop the conflict, but Batman and Captain America convince Access to take them to the conflict as well. Witnessing the minds of Batman and Captain America as they try to stop the fight, the Brothers realize that the two men are essentially the brothers in miniature, each one unique among their worlds, but with no interest in the conflict that the brothers have engaged in. Acknowledging the pointlessness of their conflict, the Brothers withdraw.\n\nThe series was collected into a trade paperback titled \"DC versus Marvel Comics\" (collects mini-series and \"Doctor Strangefate\" #1; 163 pages; September 1996; ).\n\n"}
{"id": "726338", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=726338", "title": "Daemonologie", "text": "Daemonologie\n\nDaemonologie—in full Daemonologie, In Forme of a Dialogue, Divided into three Books: By the High and Mighty Prince, James &c.—was written and published in 1597 by King James VI of Scotland (later also James I of England) as a philosophical dissertation on contemporary necromancy and the historical relationships between the various methods of divination used from ancient black magic. This included a study on demonology and the methods demons used to bother troubled men while touching on topics such as werewolves and vampires. It was a political yet theological statement to educate a misinformed populace on the history, practices and implications of sorcery and the accused of being a witch under the rule of canonical law. This book is believed to be one of the main sources used by William Shakespeare in the production of \"Macbeth\". Shakespeare attributed many quotes and rituals found within the book directly to the Weird Sisters, yet also attributed the Scottish themes and settings referenced from the trials in which King James was involved.\n\nKing James wrote a dissertation titled \"Daemonologie\" that was first sold in 1597, several years prior to the first publication of the King James Authorized Version of the Bible. Within three short books James wrote a philosophical dissertation in the form of a Socratic dialogue for the purpose of making arguments and comparisons between magic, sorcery and witchcraft, but wrote also his Classification of demons. In writing the book, King James was heavily influenced by his personal involvement in the North Berwick witch trials from 1590. Following the execution of a notorious sorcerer in the year 1591, the news of the trials was narrated in a news pamphlet titled \"Newes from Scotland\" and was included as the final chapter of the text. The book endorses the practice of witch hunting in a Christian society. James begins the book: The fearefull aboundinge at this time in this countrie, of these detestable slaves of the Devil, the Witches or enchanters, hath moved me (beloved reader) to dispatch in post, this following treatise of mine (...) to resolve the doubting (...) both that such assaults of Satan are most certainly practised, and that the instrument thereof merits most severely to be punished.\n\nAs detailed in his preface, the main sources of this work were that of historically confessed witches, judicial case history and the Bible itself, although he also amassed various dissertations on magical studies to expand his education on the relationships between infernal spirits and men. James generally sought to prove that the devilish arts have always been yet still are, but also explains the justification of a witch trial and the punishments which a practitioner of the dark arts merits. He also reasons scholastically what kinds of things are possible in the performance of these arts, and the natural causes of the Devil's power with the use of philosophical reasoning. King James sought to prove the existence of witchcraft to other Christians through biblical teachings. As such, his work is separated into three books based on the different arguments the philosophers discuss, with citations of biblical scripture throughout the text.\n\nThis work acts as a political and theological dissertation in the form of a philosophical dialogue between the characters Philomathes and Epistemon who debate the various topics of magic, sorcery, witchcraft and demonology. The purpose seems to be an educational piece on the study of witchcraft and to inform the public about the histories and etymologies of all subcategories involved in magical practices. The work also serves to make formal accusations against the practice of witchcraft and comparatively elaborates James' views against papistry. In the preface, King James states that he chose to write the content in the form of a dialogue to better entertain the reader. By doing so, he follows the method of many philosophical writers prior to his time. As the main plot, Philomathes hears news in the kingdom regarding the rumors of witchcraft which seems all miraculous and amazing but could find no one knowledgeable on the matter to have a serious political discussion on the issue. He finds a philosopher named Epistemon who is very knowledgeable on the topics of theology.\n\nThe argument of the first book is on the following topics regarding the description of Magic: \n\nThe main argument of the second book is based on the following topics regarding the description of Sorcery and Witchcraft:\n\nThe third book is the conclusion of the whole Dialogue. Here, King James provides a description of all these kinds of Spirits and Specters that trouble men or women. His Classification of demons was not based on separate demonic entities with their names, ranks, or titles but rather categorized them based on 4 methods used by any given devil to cause mischief or torment on a living individual or a deceased corpse. He quotes previous authors who state that each devil has the ability to appear in diverse shapes or forms for varying arrays of purposes as well. In his description of them, he relates that demons are under the direct supervision of God and are unable to act without permission, further illustrating how demonic forces are used as a \"Rod of Correction\" when men stray from the will of God and may be commissioned by witches, or magicians to conduct acts of ill will against others but will ultimately only conduct works that will end in the further glorification of God despite their attempts to do otherwise. The demonic forces were described as follows:\n\nNewes from Scotland - declaring the damnable life and death of Dr. Fian, a notable sorcerer is a pamphlet originally printed in London in 1591 that details the infamous North Berwick witch trials in Scotland and the confessions given before the King.\n\nThe initial and subsequent publications of \"Daemonologie\" included a previously published news pamphlet detailing the accounts of the North Berwick witch trials that involved King James himself as he acted as judge over the proceedings. The deputy bailiff to the kingdom of Scotland, David Seaton, had a servant named Geillis Duncan who, within a short period of time, was found to have miraculously helped any who were troubled or grieved with sickness or infirmity. David Seaton examined her as a witch and obtained a confession that caused the apprehension of several others later declared to be notorious witches. Agnis Tompson confessed before King James to have attempted his assassination using witchcraft on more than one occasion. The pamphlet details how she attempted these. She also participated in a sabbat during All Hallows' Eve as her and others sacrificed a cat and sent it into the sea as they chanted in hopes of summoning a tempest to sink a fleet of ships accompanying James as he was arriving in the port of Leith from a trip to Norway. One ship was sunk from the storm containing gifts meant for the Queen of Scotland but the others including the ship transporting King James were unharmed. Doctor Fian was deemed a notable sorcerer and was among many others that were apprehended in the trials. The pamphlet details their reasons for conducting sorcery, the methods used, how each of the witches were apprehended and the torture methods used in their punishments and death. The case of Doctor Fian follows his compact with Satan, a conflict he had with another witch who sabotaged an enchantment meant for her daughter, his examinations during the trial, the torture he endured, his escape and subsequent execution.\n\nIt has been noted that the themes taken from \"Daemonologie\" and King James' involvement in the North Berwick witch trials may have directly contributed to Shakespeare's work \"Macbeth\". Evidence of this exists in the three witches use of ritual magic and direct quotes that directly relate to the testimony given from the witch trials described in the Newes of Scotland pamphlet. Macbeth had come into public enjoyment a few years after the publication of \"Daemonologie\" and retains many of the same Scottish themes and settings.\n\n\"Daemonologie\" assisted in the creation of witchcraft reform, heavily inspiring Richard Bernard in writing a manual on witch-finding in 1629 titled, \"A Guide to Grand-Jury Men\" which advised judicial trial procedure to take a stronger investigative approach to acquiring and analyzing evidence and obtaining witnesses to be present during witch-craft trials. There was also an influence on Matthew Hopkins in his work as a witch-finder between 1644 and 1646 in which an estimated 300 witches were tried and executed. In the year of Hopkins' death, 1647, he published \"The Discovery of Witches\" which directly cited \"Daemonologie\" as a source for creating methods in discovering a witch.\n\nThe philosophical arguments King James poses through the character Epistemon are based on concepts of theological reasoning regarding society's belief as his opponent, Philomathes, takes a philosophical stance on society's legal aspects but sought to obtain the knowledge of Epistemon. This philosophical approach signified as a philomath seeking to obtain greater knowledge through epistemology, a term that was later coined by James Frederick Ferrier in 1854.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "9827", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9827", "title": "Ethnocentrism", "text": "Ethnocentrism\n\nEthnocentrism is the act of judging another culture based on preconceptions that are found in values and standards of one's own culture. Ethnocentric behavior involves judging other groups relative to the preconceptions of one's own ethnic group or culture, especially regarding language, behavior, customs, and religion. These aspects or categories are distinctions that define each ethnicity's unique cultural identity. \n\nWilliam G. Sumner defined ethnocentrism as \"the technical name for the view of things in which one's own group is the center of everything, and all others are scaled and rated with reference to it.\" He further characterized ethnocentrism as often leading to pride, vanity, belief in one's own group's superiority, and contempt for outsiders. These problems may occur from the dividing of societies into in-groups and out-groups. Ethnocentrism is explained in the social sciences and genetics. In anthropology, cultural relativism is used as an antithesis and antonym to ethnocentrism.\n\nThe term \"ethnocentrism\" was coined by Ludwig Gumplowicz and subsequently employed by William G. Sumner. Gumplowicz defined ethnocentrism as the reasons by virtue of which each group of people believed it had always occupied the highest point not only among contemporaneous peoples and nations but also in relation to all peoples of the historical past (Der Rassenkampf, 1883). \n\nAlthough central to anthropology, sociology, psychology, and other disciplines the concept of ethnocentrism has been defined and characterized so variously that some scholars have spoken of the \"disutility of the ethnocentrism concept\" and have wondered whether from the large body of research on ethnocentrism any conclusions could be drawn.\n\nWilliam Graham Sumner proposed two different definitions. In the 1906 \"Folkways\", Sumner stated that \"ethnocentrism is the technical name for this view of things in which one's own group is the center of everything, and all others are scaled and rated with reference to it\" (13). In the 1911 \"War and Other Essays\", he wrote that \"the sentiment of cohesion, internal comradeship, and devotion to the in-group, which carries with it a sense of superiority to any out-group and readiness to defend the interests of the in-group against the out-group, is technically known as ethnocentrism\" (11).\n\nForty years later, anthropologist Richard Adams undertook to clear up a confusion. He noted that one scholar, G.P. Murdock, defined ethnocentrism as \"the tendency to exalt the in-group and to depreciate other groups,\" which made out-group antagonism the inevitable concomitant of in-group solidarity, but that another, M. J. Herkovits, defined ethnocentrism as \"the point of view that one's way of life is to be preferred to all others.\" He pointed out that these were two different attitudes, and that it was important to distinguish them. The first is in-group consciousness, a sense of communal interests found even in sub-human animals, but the second arises from the processes of socialization and enculturation, and has no counterpart among sub-human groups.\n\nIn 1996, Robert K. Merton commented that \"although the practice of seeing one's own group as the center of things is empirically correlated with a belief in superiority, centrality and superiority need to be kept analytically distinct in order to deal with patterns of alienation from one's membership group and contempt for it.\"\n\nPeople raised in a particular culture that absorb the values and behaviors of that culture will develop a worldview that considers their own culture to be the norm. If people then experience other cultures that have different values and behaviors, they will find that the thought patterns appropriate to their native culture are not appropriate for the new cultures. However, since people are accustomed to their native culture, it can be difficult for them to see the behaviors of people from a different culture from the viewpoint of that culture rather than from their own.\n\nEthnocentrism can be explicit or implicit. Explicit ethnocentrism involves the ability to express the feelings about outsiders (people from other groups), and implicit ethnocentrism refers to the inhibition of the feelings for outsiders.\n\nAnthropology in the 19th-century had been committed to using evolution as a methodological framework in which European society and culture represented the apex of human development, and all non-European societies and their cultures were described and ranked according to the degree to which they had developed a monotheistic religion, science, technology, and so on. Franz Boas committed himself to overthrowing 19th-century evolutionism, and with his methodological innovations sought to show the error of the proposition that race determined cultural capacity. Boas wrote:\n\nBoas and his colleagues promulgated the principle that there are no inferior races or cultures. Cultural relativism in anthropology is a methodological principle, indispensable for investigating and comparing societies in as unprejudiced way as possible without using a developmental scale that is usually irrelevant. \nAnthropologists such as Franz Boas and Bronislaw Malinowski argued that any human science had to transcend the ethnocentrism of the scientist. Both urged anthropologists to conduct ethnographic fieldwork in order to overcome their ethnocentrism. Boas developed the principle of cultural relativism where the \"context\" plays an important role to the understanding of other people's values, and Malinowski developed the theory of functionalism as guides for producing non-ethnocentric studies of different cultures. Classic examples of anti-ethnocentric anthropology include Margaret Mead's \"Coming of Age in Samoa\" (1928), Malinowski's \"The Sexual Life of Savages in North-Western Melanesia\" (1929), and Ruth Benedict's \"Patterns of Culture\" (1934). (Mead and Benedict were two of Boas's students.)\n\nExamples of ethnocentrism include religiocentric constructs claiming a divine association like \"divine nation\", \"God's Own Country\", \"God's Chosen People\", and \"God's Promised Land\". Although this may be seen as classic examples, a study published by Brill showed that religious attitudes do not effect on negative out-group attitudes.\n\nIn \"Precarious Life\", Judith Butler discusses recognizing the Other in order to sustain the Self and the problems of not being able to identify the Other. Butler writes:\n\nScholars are generally agreed that Boas developed his revolutionary ideas under the influence of the German philosopher Immanuel Kant. Legend has it that, on a field trip to the Baffin Islands in 1883, Boas would pass the frigid nights reading Kant’s monumental \"Critique of Pure Reason\". In that work, Kant argued that human understanding could not be described according to the laws that applied to the operations of nature, and that its operations were therefore free, not determined, and that ideas regulated human action, sometimes independent of material interests. Following Kant, Boas pointed out, for instance, the starving Eskimos who, because of their religious beliefs,would not hunt seals to feed themselves, thus showing that no pragmatic or material calculus determined their values (\"The Mind of Primitive Man\", New York: Macmillan, 1911:126). \n\nConsumer ethnocentrism refers to the preference of buying products from one's own country with the purpose of protecting the economy and the jobs of people in the country. It involves the brand and quality of the products. In order to measure the levels of a consumer's ethnocentric tendencies, the CETSACALE was created and used for many countries and cultures.\n\nThere is no broad consensus as to the cause of ethnocentrism. Various areas of social and biological science have developed theories as to how ethnocentrism works. The social identity approach to psychology suggests that ethnocentricity is caused by a strong identification with one's own culture that links one's self-esteem to a positive view of that culture. It's theorized that in order to maintain that positive view, people make social comparisons that cast competing cultural groups in an unfavorable light.\n\nResearch published by PNAS (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America) suggested that ethnocentrism may be mediated by the oxytocin hormone. It was found that in randomized controlled trials \"oxytocin creates intergroup bias because oxytocin motivates in-group favoritism and, to a lesser extent, out-group derogation\".\n\nIn \"The Selfish Gene\", evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins writes that \"Blood-feuds and inter-clan warfare are easily interpretable in terms of Hamilton's genetic theory.\" Simulation-based experiments in evolutionary game theory have attempted to provide an explanation for the selection of ethnocentric-strategy phenotypes.\n\nRealistic conflict theory assumes that ethnocentrism happens due to \"real or perceived conflict\" in between groups. This also happens with new members of a group where the dominant group may perceive the new ones as a threat.\n\n\n\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\n\n"}

It occurs several times throughout the Talmud. The New Testament quotes Jesus as saying that \"it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God\".\n\nThe eye of a sewing needle is the part formed into a loop for pulling thread, located at the end opposite from the point.\n\nThe Babylonian Talmud applies the aphorism to unthinkable thoughts. To explain that dreams reveal the thoughts of a man's heart, the product of reason rather than the absence of it, some rabbis say:\n\nA Midrash on the Song of Songs uses the phrase to speak of God's willingness and ability beyond comparison, to accomplish the salvation of a sinner:\n\nRav Sheishet of Nehardea applies the same aphorism to the convoluted reasoning for which the sages of Pumbedita were evidently famous: \"Are you from Pumbedita, where they push an elephant through the eye of a needle?\" (Baba Metzia, 38b).\n\n\"The eye of a needle\" is scripture quoting Jesus recorded in the synoptic gospels:\n\nParallel versions appear in , and .\n\nThe saying was a response to a young rich man who had asked Jesus what he needed to do in order to inherit eternal life. Jesus replied that he should keep the commandments, to which the man stated he had done. Jesus responded, \"If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.\" The young man became sad and was unwilling to do this. Jesus then spoke this response, leaving his disciples astonished.\n\nCyril of Alexandria (fragment 219) claimed that \"camel\" is a Greek misspelling; that \"kamêlos\" (camel) was written in place of \"kamilos\", meaning \"rope\" or \"cable\". More recently, George Lamsa, in his into English from the Syriac, claimed this as well.\n\nSchopenhauer, in \"The World as Will and Representation\", Volume 1, § 68, quoted Matthew 19:24. \"Es ist leichter, daß ein Ankertau durch ein Nadelöhr gehe, denn daß ein Reicher ins Reich Gottes komme.\" This is translated into English as \"It is easier for an anchor cable to go through an eye of a needle than for a rich person to come to God’s kingdom.\"\n\nIn modern times, the scripture has been used as a counterargument to the \"prosperity gospel\", the belief that accruing wealth is a virtue favored by God.\n\nThe \"Eye of the Needle\" has been claimed to be a gate in Jerusalem, which opened after the main gate was closed at night. A camel could only pass through this smaller gate if it was stooped and had its baggage removed. This story has been put forth since at least the 15th century, and possibly as far back as the 9th century. However, there is no widely accepted evidence for the existence of such a gate.\n\nAccording to the English interpretation of the Quran:\n\n\n"}

The house of Finnigans was once one of the finest British leather goods maker and a successful luxury goods retailer. Renown for its traditional know-how and craftsmanship, Finnigans manufactured and produced a wide range of luxury products, including trunks, bags, fashion, jewelry, timepieces and silverware.\n\nFinnigans was founded by Brian Finnigan, an Irishman proudly claiming descent from Brian Boru, the charismatic king of Ireland in the high Middle Ages. He was the son of a seafarer, who spent summer months sailing off the coast of Newfoundland, where he hunted whale and seal in Arctic waters.\n\nIn 1805, Brian Finnigan apprenticed to his father’s friend and former sailing partner, Reuben Farrel, who then made leather goods in Liverpool, especially bags and trunks. These durable and weatherproof luggage were particularly adapted to the long and tedious journeys of that time. Both Reuben Farrel and Brian Finnigan moved to Manchester as it developed into a prosperous city with the boom of the cotton industry.\n\nIn 1830, Brian Finnigan established a house on his own, the house of Finnigans. He opened a workshop in Newton Street Mill, and a Finnigans shop in Market Street, then Manchester most fashionable area. Finnigans soon became famous for its high quality leather goods and saddlery.\n\nParticularly timely, the opening of the shop coincided with the beginning of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway and Robert Stephenson’s Rocket, the world’s first steam passenger railway, which increased demand for travel goods. Finnigans devised a special range of items for railway travel like the “Lady Train Case”, with a jewelry tray and enough room for a woman’s travelling wardrobe. From then on, the house relentlessly innovated to adapt its travel goods to the new means of transportation from the railway to the automobile, and later air travel.\n\nAs picnicking became a fashionable outdoor activity, Finnigans elaborated the “Wicker Picnic Basket”, which was popular not only among English travelers, but also Indian Rajahs who strapped them on the backs of elephants.\n\nIn 1851, Finnigans gained international recognition when the house won a gold medal for craftsmanship at Prince Albert’s Great Exhibition at the Crystal Palace, thereby spreading Finnigans’ reputation even wider.\n\nBy 1855, Finnigans had branched out, and now advertised as a trunk and portmanteau manufacturer. Its range of items constantly increased to include new items that were adapted to the new means of transportation.\n\nOne such item was the “Treble Folding Portmanteau” so constructed that the compartments were accessible at once and entirely distinct from each other, “rendering it unnecessary for luggage being disturbed or moved in passing through the customs.”\n\nThe house’s growth led to the opening of new premises at Piccadilly and Oxford Street, in addition to its original location at Market Street, Manchester.\n\nWilliam Finnigan, who embodied the second generation of the family business, built on his father’s business and was the man behind the company’s diversification and commercial success. He took over when Brian Finnigan passed away in 1868.\n\nIn 1879, William Finnigan opened a Finnigans shop at New Bond Street in London. Soon, American millionaires such as the Rockefellers, the Vanderbilts and the Fords joined the house’s customer base. Opposite Finnigans on Bond Street was Asprey: the two houses enjoyed a friendly rivalry that led to fruitful commercial developments. Still specializing in leather and saddlery, Finnigans also sold clocks, watches, and silverware.\n\nTheir London other addresses were Clifford Street, Coach & Horses Yard, Old Burlington Street while their London works were at 6-10 Lexington Street, W1.\n\nFinnigans also had stores in Liverpool at 32 Bold Street and 37-41 Dale Street.\n\nBy the end of the century, the Manchester premises also grew too exiguous, and Finnigans moved to a more spacious building in Deansgate. With the department store Kendals at one end and Finnigans at the other, Deansgate became Manchester’s main shopping street. The Deansgate store later enlarged to encompass Finnigan’s galleries, including a sports department, fashion and menswear, as well as beauty products.\n\nAs the use of both personal and professional staff declined, the need for more lightweight luggage arose. Additionally, the use of motor car travel and the individual liberalization of travel were partly responsible for a new generation of luggage.\n\nPortability became Finnigans’ priority. In 1909, Finnigans advertised cases that were strong and resistant yet “so light you can easily carry one yourself and thus retain your jewellery and valuables under your own control.” In 1912, Finnigans also commercialized a “Lady’s Motor Hand Bag,” both lightweight and fitted.\n\nFinnigans adapted to modern forms of travels and developed special lines of luggage for overseas travel, especially on ocean liners such as the Titanic, Normandie, Queen Mary, and Canberra.\n\nWhile practical, Finnigans’ travel items were also of great workmanship. The house’s lightweight dressing cases in colourful, polished Morocco were particularly successful. Among items of the highest luxury was a dressing case to be offered as a present for marriage or birthday in crocodile skin, solid gold mountings, and tortoiseshell handles. Crocodile briefcases by Finnigans have become highly valued collectible.\n\nIn the 1930s, Finnigans launched a sports clothing line to fit the new lifestyle of the elite, and especially the vogue of sunbathing and swimming in seaside resorts. A two-piece bathing suit in bright yellow is preserved at the Victoria & Albert Museum in London.\n\nAir travel brought weight restrictions and begat a reduction in the weight, size, and structure of luggage to which Finnigans contributed. New materials like vulcanized fiber replaced the heavier structured cases of leather and wood.\n\nIn 1938, the fourth generation of the family took over and Brian Finnigan, named after his ancestor, became the managing director. During the Second World War, the house of Finnigans contributed to the war effort as its factory produced much needed webbing equipment.\n\nBrian Finnigan expanded the reach of the family business and built up an export market in New York, Canada, and the Caribbean. After the war, Peter Finnigan joined his cousin Brian in the company and travelled to Macy's in New York in order to learn from modern American department stores and strengthen Finnigans’ export activities.\n\nThe two men studied with the uttermost interest the moving of city stores to suburban locations and the advent of the shopping mall. When the lease of the Deansgate store in Manchester expired in the 1950s, they pioneered this new retailing trend and moved Finnigans to Wilmslow, twelve miles from Manchester’s city centre. Many other shops followed, making Wilmslow a thriving shopping centre.\n\nWhile in Wilmslow, Finnigans retained its luxury positioning, and notably sold tailor-made suits in high quality tweed. The house also produced high fashion handbags in crocodile lined with suede that were of “lasting luxury”.\n\nIn 1968, Finnigans closed its New Bond Street store in London. The company remained a family-run business until it shut down its last store in 1988.\n\nThe house of Finnigans has since changed hands and now belongs to the Luvanis company, specialized in reviving long dormant brands, such as Moynat and Belber.\n\n\n\n"}

The botanical descriptions and illustrations were to become highly valued by the English audience; the finely crafted and illustrated work was of both scientific and horticultural interest.\n\nSibthorp met the botanical illustrator Bauer in Vienna, where he had made a voyage to study a copy of Dioscorides' early botanical work, the renowned Vienna Dioscurides. This was the first part of a journey, to identify medicinal plants used in Greece; Bauer was to join the expedition as the illustrator. They were to record and collect a large number of novel specimens; their publication introduced these to an English audience. From March 1786 to December 1787 they surveyed the plants and animals of the eastern Mediterranean, Sibthorp collecting and describing, Bauer making dried specimens and producing colour-coded sketches. Bauer's work, including around a thousand intricate and annotated sketches, is now regarded as one of the finest examples of botanical illustration.\n\nSibthorp's volumes were to become a botanical publication, the original intention to produce a herbal or medical volume was transformed into a scientific survey. An accompanying volume, \"Fauna Graeca\", and other planned works on the region, was not realised.\n\nSibthorp assembled the descriptions and plates, at his death in 1796 his will included an endowment to see the book published. The task of preparing the works was undertaken by James Edward Smith, who issued the two volumes of the Prodromus in 1806 and 1813, and six volumes as Flora Graeca Sibthorpiana between 1806 and 1828. The seventh appeared in 1830, after Smith's death, and the remaining three were produced by John Lindley between 1833 and 1840.\nE\nEach volume contained a hundred plates, except the last, and these were engraved by James Sowerby. Only 30 copies of this set were issued, another 50 complete sets were reissued in 1845 by Henry George Bohn. The cost in 1830 was 620 pounds. The scarcity of the early first editions led to doubt of their existence, the rare book is at the higher end of trade. The inherent value has led the Bodleian Libraries to make available a digital scan of the complete set.\n\nThe publication was issued with tables and indices of the scientific name, the common name in Greek was in this concordance.\nIt was during a period of increasing interest in horticulture and highly desired exotic species were described, many would become perennials of the English flower garden.\n\n\n"}

The Golden Triangle is now a well traveled route providing a good spectrum of the country's different landscapes. The circuit is about 720 km by road. Each leg is about 4 to 6 hours of drive. The Shatabdi express train also connects Delhi with Agra and Jaipur.\n"}

The greeting is used at traditional meetings among Māori people, and at major ceremonies, such as a \"pōwhiri\". It may be followed by a handshake.\n\nIn the hongi, the \"ha\" (breath of life) is exchanged in a symbolic show of unity. Through the exchange of this greeting, one is no longer considered \"manuhiri\", a visitor, but rather \"tangata whenua\", one of the people of the land. \n\nWhen Māori greet one another by pressing noses, the tradition of sharing the breath of life is considered to have come directly from the gods. In Māori mythology, woman was created by the Gods moulding her shape out of the earth. The god Tāne embraced the figure and breathed into her nostrils. She then sneezed and came to life, creating the first woman in Māori legends, Hineahuone.\n\nThe hongi may be performed by Māori and non-Māori, and between New Zealanders and foreign visitors. Several royals have been greeted with the hongi during visits to New Zealand, including: Prince Charles; Diana, Princess of Wales; Prince William; and Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was greeted with a hongi on a November 2010 visit to Wellington. Former U.S. President Barack Obama exchanged a hongi with New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern during a visit to the country in March 2018.\n\n"}

{"id": "1536498", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1536498", "title": "Inventio", "text": "Inventio\n\nInventio, one of the five canons of rhetoric, is the method used for the \"discovery of arguments\" in Western rhetoric and comes from the Latin word, meaning \"invention\" or \"discovery\". \"Inventio\" is the central, indispensable canon of rhetoric, and traditionally means a systematic search for arguments.\n\nA speaker uses \"Inventio\" when he or she begins the thought process to form and develop an effective argument. Often, the invention phase can be seen as the first step in an attempt to generate ideas or create an argument that is convincing and compelling. The other four canons of classical rhetoric (the others being dispositio, elocutio, memoria, and pronuntiatio) rely on their interrelationship with invention.\n\nAccording to Crowley and Hawhee, invention is the division of rhetoric that investigates the possible means by which proofs can be discovered. It supplies the speaker and writers with sets of instructions or ideas that help them to find and compose arguments that are appropriate for a given rhetorical situation.\n\nFor personal and lyric essays, narratives, and descriptive writing, invention techniques help writers draw from their memory and observation for the kinds of details that will add depth to their essays.\n\nThe first direction of invention aims toward deriving heuristic procedures or systematic strategies that will aid students in discovering and generating ideas about which they might write; the second direction of invention is characterized by how writers establish \"voice\" in writing and realize individual selves in discourse.\n\nOne of the oldest criticisms of rhetoric is that as an art it has no proper subject matter. In other words, an orator might speak on any topic, with his success being measured purely on the brilliance of his rhetorical skills. This aspect of rhetoric is one reason why Plato attacked what he saw as empty rhetoric on the part of sophist philosophers such as Gorgias.\n\nAristotle, in his works on rhetoric, answered Plato's charges by arguing that reason and rhetoric are intertwined (\"Rhetoric is the counterpart of Dialectic\" is the first sentence of his \"Rhetoric\"). In Aristotle's view, dialectic reasoning is the mechanism for discovering universal truths; rhetoric is the method for clarifying and communicating these principles to others. And in order to communicate effectively, an orator must be able to assemble proper arguments that support a thesis.\n\n\"Inventio\", therefore, is the systematic discovery of rhetorical practices. In the Greek and Roman traditions, rhetorical practices are often but not always arguments. Aristotle, as well as later writers on rhetoric, such as Cicero and Quintilian, devoted considerable attention to developing and formalizing the discipline of rhetorical invention. Two important concepts within invention were topoi and stasis. Other rhetorical cultures seem to have additional means of locating \"available means.\" Historian of Celtic poetics Robert Graves credited analepsis as a method of inventing his historical arguments in \"The White Goddess\", and the Mazatec medicine woman Maria Sabina credited the hallucinogenic psilocybe mushroom with the flow of her discourse. The philosopher Jacques Derrida described \"inventio\" as the \"invention of the other.\"\n\nJanice Lauer proposes that invention should be: (1) applicable to a wide variety of writing situations so that they will transcend a particular topic and can be internalized by the student; (2) flexible in direction allowing a thinker to return to a previous step or skip to an inviting one as the evolving idea suggests; and (3) highly generative by involving the writer in various operations—such as visualizing, classifying, defining, rearranging, and dividing—that are known to stimulate insights.\n\nIn classical rhetoric, arguments are obtained from various sources of information, or topoi (Greek 'places'; i.e. \"places to find something\"), also called by the Latin name \"loci\" (\"cf\". Literary topoi). Topoi are categories that help delineate the relationships among ideas; Aristotle divided these into \"common\" and \"special\" groups.\n\nIn the common group could be found such categories as laws, witnesses, contracts, oaths, comparisons of similarity, difference, or degree, definitions of things, division of things (whole or parts, for instance), cause and effect, and other items that could be analyzed, researched, or documented.\n\nModern writers and students use these topics, as well, when discovering arguments, although today more emphasis is placed on scientific facts, statistics, and other \"hard\" evidence. Classical rhetoricians saw many areas of inquiry that today's writer might view as being purely in the province of \"logic,\" developing syllogisms, finding contradictions, as being of equal or greater importance. Barbara Warnick has compared the 28 topics of Aristotle's \"Rhetoric\" and topical schemes of Chaïm Perelman and Lucie Olbrechts-Tyteca's \"The New Rhetoric\" to illustrate major differences of rhetoric throughout these time periods. For example, two of Aristotle's topics \"Opponent's Utterance\" and \"Response to Slander\" were more relevant to ancient debates in the practice of Athenian law, in which every citizen was his or her own lawyer. On the other hand, Perelman and Olbrechts-Tytecha's schemes were meant to be comprehensive rather than outlining every single detail of speaking. While Aristotle's Rhetoric focused mainly on oral endeavors, Perelman and Olbrechts-Tytecha'sThe New Rhetoric dealt with written arguments. Writing is a modern innovation that was looked down upon in ancient Greece. According to Warnick, another difference between the two systems is that Aristotle developed Rhetoric as a way of spreading the practice of rhetoric so it could be performed and taught correctly. Perelman and Olbrechts-Tytecha's The New Rhetoric emphasized the study of rhetoric, focusing more on the understanding of the topic rather than the practice of it.\n\nSpecial topoi included such concepts as justice or injustice, virtue, good, and worthiness. Again, these are areas of inquiry seen by many today as belonging to other arts, but from Greek times through the Renaissance, these were considered integral to the study and practice of rhetoric.\n\nTopics (or topoi) can be used to invent arguments and also to conceptualize and formulate the single-sentence declarative thesis. Edward P.J. Corbett, Robert Connors, Richard P. Hughes, and P. Albert Duhamel define topics as \"ways of probing one's subject in order to find the means to develop that subject\". They issued four common topics that are most useful to students: definition, analogy, consequence, and testimony. Definition involves the creation of a thesis by taking a fact or an idea and explaining it by precisely identifying its nature; it always asks the question \"What is/was it?\" Analogy is concerned with discovering resemblances or differences between two or more things proceeding from known to unknown; it is a useful tool for investigating comparisons and contrasts because it always asks the question \"What is it like or unlike?\" Consequence investigates phenomena costs to effect-to-cause pattern, best established through probabilities from patterns that have previously occurred. It always answers the question \"What caused/causes/will cause it?\" Testimony relies on appeals to an authority (such as an expert opinion, statistics, or the law), and it always answers the question \"What does an authority say about it?\" \"Ultimately a thesis or an argument must say something about the real world. Teaching the topics requires using examples and good examples are to be had by applying each topic to a definite subject and coming up with several thesis statements\".\n\nAristotle described three \"modes of persuasion,\" or \"appeals.\" The first dealt with the matter of the case (logos), the second dealt with the character of the speaker (ethos), and the third dealt with the emotions of the audience (pathos). Each mode of persuasion can be inventional, helping an orator create an effective argument.\n\nAristotle defined ethos as an appeal based on a speaker’s character within a persuasive act. Later, the Roman rhetorician Cicero expanded this definition to contain elements of character outside a particular rhetorical act. Most rhetoric scholars today combine the two definitions, understanding ethos to mean character both inside and outside a rhetorical circumstance. Speakers use the mode of ethos when they create an argument based on their own character. When relying on ethos, a speaker uses personal “trustworthiness or credibility” to persuade the audience to believe their specific argument on a particular topic (Ramage 81). For example, if a presidential candidate has a long history of philanthropy, he or she will invent an argument that demonstrates personal good character in order to convince the audience that he or she is the best candidate for office.\n\nPathos represents an appeal to the audience’s emotions. This appeal can be achieved by the use of metaphors, storytelling, or general passion. In order to appeal to an audience’s emotions during the speech’s delivery, the speaker must first take the audience’s emotion into account during the early invention phase. For example, if a presidential candidate grew up poor and managed to succeed in life through hard work and education, then the candidate would have to apply that story to the speech-inventing process in order to appeal to the audience’s emotions. This storytelling draws upon the common \"bootstraps\" narrative of American culture, one that often appeals to the emotions of the U.S. electorate.\n\nAs Aristotle explains, logos, often referred to as the \"logical\" appeal, uses the arguments present in the case itself to appeal to the audience's reason. Aristotle writes that logos depends on \"the proof, or apparent proof, provided by the words of the speech itself.\" Logos appeals work \"when we have proved a truth or an apparent truth by means of the persuasive arguments suitable to the case in question.\" \"Inventio\" is linked with logos such that it deals with what an author would say as opposed to \"how\" it might be said.\n\nAccording to rhetorical scholar Thomas O. Sloane, Cicero described rhetoric as the devising of true or seemingly true arguments for the sake of making one’s case appear probable. Therefore, a speaker must debate both sides of an argument to invent an effective argument. Sloane goes on to say it is important for a speaker to critique every aspect of his or her argument. Ciceronian invention is simply an analytical process of argument. However, as a theorist of law, Cicero put forward a specific procedure commonly referred to as stasis theory.\n\nStasis is a procedure by which a speaker poses questions in order to clarify the main issues and persuasive points of a speech or debate. This procedure allows the speaker to critically question each point, assessing the relative worth of each point as appropriate to the substance of the case and to its capacity to persuade an audience.\n\nUsing stasis theory gives the speaker numerous advantages that will help them excel in persuading. According to Crowley and Hawhee, the following advantages may accrue in the use of stasis theory.\n\n\nThere are four types of stasis: conjectural (question of fact: Is/was it?), definitional (question of definition: What is/what is its meaning?), qualitative (question of quality: How good or bad is/was it), and translative (question of place or procedure: Is/was this appropriate process or place to handle the matter?). For instance, a lawyer defending someone accused of damaging property might pose the following questions:\n\n\nThe question of fact is key as the first step in formulating any argument is separating the true from the false. If the terms of the argument at hand cannot be agreed on, the discussion will not move in any positive direction. Going back and forth attacking sources of information is not conducive to making any real progress, so an emphasis on using only solid information and evidence-based anecdotes is at the crucial to achieving stasis\n\nThe question of definition means to define what, exactly, the issue of concern is, and what, if any, biases or preconceptions our arguments hold. Then, categorizing the problem is the next focus, agreeing on the class of the event and therefore the attitude with which it should be approached. A political disagreement should be investigated with a different lens than a criminal case, for example, as they are concerns of a different nature.\n\nThe question of quality means identifying the magnitude of the event, the wider impacts, as well as what would happen if no action were to be taken. Identifying if this problem is important as part of a bigger picture is key to preparing a sound argument, as well as figuring out whether or not it is a cause worth pursuing. The quality aspect of stasis comes down to deciding if this particular problem requires attention, and at what cost will a resolution come about.\n\nThe question of jurisdiction means formulating a plan of action. Just as we calculate whether the particular problem is worth the energy in the quality category, here we make the decision to take action. A plan of action includes determining what kind of people should be involved in solving this problem, and what strategy these people will use.\n\nInvention also entails the adaptation of ideas and stylistic devices to unfamiliar audiences. Rhetorical scholar John M. Murphy argues that rhetorical traditions consist of common patterns of language use and organized “social knowledge” of communities that make resources available for the invention of effective arguments. Invention allows these rhetorical traditions to be adapted across cultural differences or situations. Murphy provides an example in which an orator would blend several rhetorical traditions: one by which the orator might primarily identify and another by which the audience might identify, thus merging speaker and audience through a display of interconnected rhetorical traditions.\n\nTo Cicero, traditional rhetoric was a \"mode of thought\" and to attain this rhetoric it is required to make the \"true nature of rhetorical inventio\" apparent. Thomas O. Sloane, a rhetorical scholar, discusses that \"inventio\" in the rhetorical tradition specifically refers to addressing the pros and cons of an argumentation. Sloane argues that it is required when using \"inventio\" as a tool that one must not only consider the discourse at hand but the discourses that accompany the positives and negatives attached. In further explanation, one must debate all sides of an argument \"or one's \"inventio\" will remain not fully invented.\" In modern revivals of rhetoric, Sloane argues along with Reed Way Dasenbrock that these pros and cons of \"inventio\" do not have as much emphasis as they did in Cicero. This lack of attention to different sides of an argument is why Dasenbrock believes that the revival of rhetoric \"is relevant; [but] it isn't complete.\"\n\nAmplification is a term in rhetoric defined as the enrichment of words to increase rhetorical effect. It is closely related to invention such that it deals with the development and progression of notions, drawing from the topics of invention. Topics of invention can also be seen as topics of amplification, especially those of division, definition, and comparison.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19232618", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19232618", "title": "Israeli mafia", "text": "Israeli mafia\n\nThe Israeli mafia ( or ) is the general term for organized crime groups operating in Israel and also internationally. Allegedly there are 16 crime families operating in Israel, five major groups active on the national level, and 11 smaller organizations. There are reputed to be six Maghrebi Jewish crime families active and three Arab crime families. Many heads and members of the crime groups have either been killed or are in prison.\n\nThe major crime groups are the Abergils, the Abutbuls, the Alperons, the Dumranis, the Shirazis, the Amir Molnar and Zeev Rosenstein syndicates. The illegal activities they are engaged in include operating casinos and other forms of gambling inside and outside Israel, car theft, prostitution, drug trafficking, human trafficking, money laundering, protection and extortion rackets, loan sharking and drug dealing.\n\nAccording to Israel's former Police Commissioner David Cohen, Israeli crime organizations had penetrated the formal economic sector and local governments, and \"equipped themselves with large quantities of combat means explosives and arms.\" In a mob war starting in the early 2000s between the crime families, several crime bosses were killed. It also cost the lives of innocent bystanders.\nThe Iakhbal is the Israeli Special Police Unit that fights organized crime.\n\nIn 2010, it was reported by Wikileaks that the United States Embassy in Israel expressed grave concern that Inbal Gavrieli, the niece of one of Israel's most powerful mafia families, had been elected to the Knesset as an MK for the Likud party.\n\nThe immigration of Egyptian and Moroccan Jews to Israel and their settlement in the more impoverished neighborhoods led to the creation of crime families among Maghrebi Jews. This is evident in the fact that a large number of \"Israeli\" organized criminals have fled to Morocco in recent years. Israeli crime families of Moroccan Jewish descent expanded their operations to Europe and the USA, especially with their involvement in drug trafficking. Some of Israel's more well-known crime families are of North African and Middle Eastern Jewish descent: the Abergil crime family as well as the Abutbul and Domrani clans are originally from Morocco, the Alperon clan came from Egypt, and the Shirazi clan from Iran.\n\nIsraeli-Arab organized crime groups were formed in Israel. Some Palestinian cities and towns are home to local crime families. Clans like Tayibe based Abdel-Kader family are involved in extortion, drug and weapon trafficking, fraud as well as money laundering, often in cooperation with their Jewish counterparts. One Arab crime family, the Jarushi family from Ramla, is one of the most powerful crime families in Israel. Another example was the criminal gang around Moussa Aliyan in New York City whose main business was the importation of heroin.\n\nThe Russian mafia in Israel began with the mass immigration of Russian Jews to Israel in 1989. Jewish Russian crime bosses such as Semion Mogilevich acquired Israeli citizenship and laundered money through Israel.\n\nThe Russian mafia saw Israel as an ideal place to launder money, as Israel's banking system was designed to encourage aliyah, the immigration of Jews, and the accompanying capital. Following the trend of global financial deregulation, Israel had also implemented legislation aimed at easing the movement of capital. Combined with the lack of anti-money laundering legislation, \"Russian\" organised crime found it an easy place to transfer ill-gotten gains. In 2005, police estimated that Russian organised crime had laundered between $5 and 10 billion in the fifteen years since the end of the Soviet Union. Non-Jewish criminals such as Sergei Mikhailov sought to get Israeli passports, using fake Jewish documentation.\n\nRussian and Ukrainian Jewish criminals have also been able to set up networks in the United States, following the large migration of Russian Jews to New York City and Miami, but also in European cities such as Berlin and Antwerp. Many of these \"Russian\" gangsters have Israeli passports as well. Infamous Russian-Jewish mobsters include Marat Balagula, Evsei Agron and their respective criminal gangs in the United States. Soviet-Jewish criminal groups in the United States are involved in racketeering, prostitution, drug trafficking, extortion, and gasoline fraud as well as murder.\n\nFamily-based organized crime groups were formed among Georgian Jewish immigrants to Israel as well. Georgian-Jewish crime families have been able to expand their operations to Western European cities such as Antwerp. They are involved in counterfeiting, fraud, money laundering, drug trafficking, weapon trafficking, prostitution and armed robbery. Such was the case with the Georgian-Jewish Melikhov clan in Antwerp.\n\nIn the 1980s Israelis set up a crime syndicate headed by Johnny Attias in New York, dubbed the \"Israeli mafia\". It pulled off the biggest gold heist in the history of Manhattan's jewelry district, getting away with over $4 million in gold jewelry. Attias was murdered in January 1990, and New York's Israeli mafia fell apart soon after. Several members among them Ron Gonen had turned informant and the authorities arrested the rest of the gang in September of that year.\n\nIsraeli crime organizations such as the Abergil crime family and Zeev Rosenstein were heavily involved in ecstasy trafficking in the United States. In a statement before Congress in 2000, officials with the U.S. Customs Service noted that \"Israeli organized-crime elements appear to be in control\" of the multibillion-dollar U.S. ecstasy trade, \"from production through the international smuggling phase\". The main drug supplier of former Gambino crime family underboss Sammy Gravano in his Arizona drug ring allegedly was New York based Israeli mobster Ilan Zarger, who allegedly distributed more than one million ecstasy pills from May 1999 to May 2000 with a wholesale value of $7 million. He pleaded guilty to charges of running a drug gang that flooded Arizona and New York with almost four million ecstasy pills over three years. Another Israeli, Oded Tuito, said to head one of the largest ecstasy-smuggling organization, which imported millions of ecstasy pills from Paris, Brussels and Frankfurt into New York, Miami and Los Angeles, was arrested in May 2001.\n\nIn 2006 Zeev Rosenstein was extradited to the U.S., after being arrested in Israel. He pleaded guilty before a federal court in Florida to charges that he distributed ecstasy pills and was sentenced to 12 years in prison which he serves in Israel. In January 2011, Itzik Abergil and Meir Abergil and three other suspects were extradited to the U.S.\n\nThey faced 77-page, 32-count federal indictment that alleges murder, massive embezzlement, money laundering, racketeering and running a large Los Angeles-based ecstasy ring. \n\n\n"}

Sugar exports were only a quarter of what they had been the start of the century, and the banana export business was in its infancy. There was a great need to promote Jamaican products to the world and attract investment to the island.\n\nThe idea to hold an international exhibition to promote Jamaican industry similar to the 1851 Great Exhibition in London is generally credited to Augustus Constantine Sinclair, head of the Government Printing Office in Jamaica, with subsequent support from William Fawcett, director of gardens and chairman of the Institute of Jamaica. For many years, they were unable to drum up sufficient support for the project, but in 1889 Sir Henry Blake arrived as the new governor of Jamaica and gave the idea his blessing.\n\nThe exhibition was funded by a £1,000 grant from the British government and loans from the Jamaican government which were guaranteed by locals in case the exhibition failed. Louis Verley, George Stiebel, and Colonel Charles Ward, between them guaranteed about half the cost.\n\nThe exhibition opened on 27 January 1891.\n\nA special medal was produced for the event, showing Queen Victoria on one side and the exhibition hall on the other.

{"id": "557407", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=557407", "title": "Japanese martial arts", "text": "Japanese martial arts\n\nJapanese martial arts refer to the variety of martial arts native to the country of Japan. At least three Japanese terms are used interchangeably with the English phrase Japanese martial arts.\n\nThe usage of term budō to mean martial arts is a modern one and historically the term meant a way of life encompassing physical, spiritual and moral dimensions with a focus of self-improvement, fulfillment or personal growth. The terms \"bujutsu\" and \"bugei\" have more discrete definitions, at least historically speaking. \"Bujutsu\" refers specifically to the practical application of martial tactics and techniques in actual combat. \"Bugei\" refers to the adaptation or refinement of those tactics and techniques to facilitate systematic instruction and dissemination within a formal learning environment.\n\nThe historical origin of Japanese martial arts can be found in the warrior traditions of the samurai and the caste system that restricted the use of weapons by other members of society. Originally, samurai were expected to be proficient in many weapons, as well as unarmed combat, and attain the highest possible mastery of combat skills.\n\nOrdinarily, the development of combative techniques is intertwined with the tools used to execute those techniques. In a rapidly changing world, those tools are constantly changing, requiring that the techniques to use them be continuously reinvented. The history of Japan is somewhat unusual in its relative isolation. Compared with the rest of the world, the Japanese tools of war evolved slowly. Many people believe that this afforded the warrior class the opportunity to study their weapons with greater depth than other cultures. Nevertheless, the teaching and training of these martial arts did evolve. For example, in the early medieval period, the bow and the spear were emphasized, but during the Tokugawa period, fewer large scale battles took place, and the sword became the most prestigious weapon. Another trend that developed throughout Japanese history was that of increasing martial specialization as society became more stratified over time.\n\nThe martial arts developed or originating in Japan are extraordinarily diverse, with vast differences in training tools, methods, and philosophy across innumerable schools and styles. That said, Japanese martial arts may generally be divided into \"koryū\" and \"gendai budō\" based on whether they existed prior to or after the Meiji Restoration, respectively. Since \"gendai budō\" and \"koryū\" often share the same historical origin, one will find various types of martial arts (such as jujutsu, kenjutsu, or naginatajutsu) on both sides of the divide.\n\n, meaning \"traditional school\", or \"old school\", refers specifically to schools of martial arts, originating in Japan, either prior to the beginning of the Meiji Restoration in 1868, or the \"Haitōrei\" edict in 1876. In modern usage, , meaning military art/science, is typified by its practical application of technique to real-world or battlefield situations.\n\nThe term also is used generally to indicate that a particular style or art is \"traditional\", rather than \"modern\". However, what it means for an art to be either \"traditional\" or \"modern\" is subject to some debate. As a rule of thumb, the primary purpose of a \"koryū\" martial art was for use in war. The most extreme example of a \"koryū\" school is one that preserves its traditional, and often ancient, martial practices even in the absence of continuing wars in which to test them. Other \"koryū\" schools may have made modifications to their practices that reflect the passage of time (which may or may not have resulted in the loss of \"koryū\" status in the eyes of its peers). This is as opposed to \"modern\" martial arts, whose primary focus is generally upon the self-improvement (mental, physical, or spiritual) of the individual practitioner, with varying degrees of emphasis on the practical application of the martial art for either sport or self-defence purposes.\n\nThe following subsections represent not individual schools of martial arts, but rather generic \"types\" of martial arts. These are generally distinguishable on the basis of their training methodology and equipment, though wide variation still exists within each.\n\n, considered by many to be Japan's national sport, has its origins in the distant past. The earliest written records of Japan, which are dated from the 8th century AD, record the first sumo match in 23 BC, occurring specifically at the request of the emperor and continuing until one man was too wounded to continue. Beginning in 728 AD, the emperor Shōmu Tennō (聖武 天皇, 701–756) began holding official sumo matches at the annual harvest festivals. This tradition of having matches in the presence of the emperor continued, but gradually spread, with matches also held at Shinto festivals, and sumo training was eventually incorporated into military training. By the 17th century, sumo was an organized professional sport, open to the public, enjoyed by both the upper class and commoners.\n\nToday, sumo retains much of its traditional trappings, including a referee dressed as a Shinto priest, and a ritual where the competitors clap hands, stomp their feet, and throw salt in the ring prior to each match. To win a match, competitors employ throwing and grappling techniques to force the other man to the ground; the first man to touch the ground with a part of the body other than the bottom of the feet, or touch the ground outside the ring with any part of the body, loses. Six grand tournaments are held annually in Japan, and each professional fighter's name and relative ranking is published after each tournament in an official list, called the \"banzuke\", which is followed religiously by sumo fans.\n\n, literally translates to \"Soft Skills\". However, more accurately, it means the art of using indirect force, such as joint locks or throwing techniques, to defeat an opponent, as opposed to direct force such as a punch or a kick. This is not to imply that jujutsu does not teach or employ strikes, but rather that the art's aim is the ability to use an attacker's force against him or her, and counter-attack where they are weakest or least defended.\n\nMethods of combat included striking (kicking, punching), throwing (body throws, joint-lock throws, unbalance throws), restraining (pinning, strangulating, grappling, wrestling) and weaponry. Defensive tactics included blocking, evading, off balancing, blending and escaping. Minor weapons such as the \"tantō\" (dagger), \"ryufundo kusari\" (weighted chain), \"jutte\" (helmet smasher), and \"kakushi buki\" (secret or disguised weapons) were almost always included in \"koryū\" jujutsu.\n\nMost of these were battlefield-based systems to be practiced as companion arts to the more common and vital weapon systems. At the time, these fighting arts went by many different names, including \"kogusoku\", \"yawara\", \"kumiuchi\", and \"hakuda\". In reality, these grappling systems were not really unarmed systems of combat, but are more accurately described as means whereby an unarmed or lightly armed warrior could defeat a heavily armed and armored enemy on the battlefield. Ideally, the samurai would be armed and would not need to rely on such techniques.\n\nIn later times, other \"koryū\" developed into systems more familiar to the practitioners of the jujutsu commonly seen today. These systems are generally designed to deal with opponents neither wearing armor nor in a battlefield environment. For this reason, they include extensive use of \"atemi waza\" (vital-striking technique). These tactics would be of little use against an armored opponent on a battlefield. They would, however, be quite valuable to anyone confronting an enemy or opponent during peacetime dressed in normal street attire. Occasionally, inconspicuous weapons such as knives or \"tessen\" (iron fans) were included in the curriculum.\n\nToday, jujutsu is practiced in many forms, both ancient and modern. Various methods of jujutsu have been incorporated or synthesized into judo and aikido, as well as being exported throughout the world and transformed into sport wrestling systems, adopted in whole or part by schools of karate or other unrelated martial arts, still practiced as they were centuries ago, or all of the above.\n\nSwordsmanship, the art of the sword, has an almost mythological ethos, and is believed by some to be the paramount martial art, surpassing all others. Regardless of the truth of that belief, the sword itself has been the subject of stories and legends through virtually all cultures in which it has been employed as a tool for violence. In Japan, the use of the katana is no different. Although originally the most important skills of the warrior class were proficiency at horse-riding and shooting the bow, this eventually gave way to swordsmanship. The earliest swords, which can be dated as far back as the Kofun era (3rd and 4th centuries) were primarily straight bladed. According to legend, curved swords made strong by the famous folding process were first forged by the smith Amakuni Yasutsuna (天國 安綱, c. 700 AD).\n\nThe primary development of the sword occurred between 987 AD and 1597 AD. This development is characterized by profound artistry during peaceful eras, and renewed focus on durability, utility, and mass production during the intermittent periods of warfare, most notably civil warfare during the 12th century and the Mongolian invasions during the 13th century (which in particular saw the transition from mostly horseback archery to hand to hand ground fighting).\n\nThis development of the sword is paralleled by the development of the methods used to wield it. During times of peace, the warriors trained with the sword, and invented new ways to implement it. During war, these theories were tested. After the war ended, those who survived examined what worked and what didn't, and passed their knowledge on. In 1600 AD, Tokugawa Ieyasu (徳川 家康, 1543–1616) gained total control of all of Japan, and the country entered a period of prolonged peace that would last until the Meiji Restoration. During this period, the techniques to use the sword underwent a transition from a primarily utilitarian art for killing, to one encompassing a philosophy of personal development and spiritual perfection.\n\nThe terminology used in Japanese swordsmanship is somewhat ambiguous. Many names have been used for various aspects of the art or to encompass the art as a whole.\n\n literally means \"the art/science of the sword\". Although the term has been used as a general term for swordsmanship as a whole, in modern times, \"kenjutsu\" refers more to the specific aspect of swordsmanship dealing with partnered sword training. It is the oldest form of training and, at its simplest level, consists of two partners with swords drawn, practicing combat drills. Historically practiced with wooden katana (\"bokken\"), this most often consists of pre-determined forms, called \"kata\", or sometimes called \"kumitachi\", and similar to the partner drills practiced in kendo. Among advanced students, \"kenjutsu\" training may also include increasing degrees of freestyle practice.\n\n, literally meaning \"the art/science of drawing a sword\", and developed in the mid-15th century, is the aspect of swordsmanship focused upon the efficient draw of the sword, cutting down one's enemy, and returning the sword to its scabbard (\"saya\"). The term came into use specifically during the Warring States Period (15th–17th centuries). Closely related to, but predating \"iaijutsu\", \"battōjutsu\" training emphasizes defensive counter-attacking. \"Battōjutsu\" training technically incorporates \"kata\", but generally consist of only a few moves, focusing on stepping up to an enemy, drawing, performing one or more cuts, and sheathing the weapon. \"Battōjutsu\" exercises tend to lack the elaborateness, as well as the aesthetic considerations of \"iaijutsu\" or \"iaidō\" \"kata\". Finally, note that use of the name alone is not dispositive; what is \"battōjutsu\" to one school may be \"iaijutsu\" to another.\n\n, approximately \"the art/science of mental presence and immediate reaction\", is also the Japanese art of drawing the sword. However, unlike \"battōjutsu\", \"iaijutsu\" tends to be technically more complex, and there is a much stronger focus upon perfecting form. The primary technical aspects are smooth, controlled movements of drawing the sword from its scabbard, striking or cutting an opponent, removing blood from the blade, and then replacing the sword in the scabbard.\n\n is the Japanese art of wielding the \"naginata\", a weapon resembling the medieval European glaive or guisarme. Most \"naginata\" practice today is in a modernized form (\"gendai budō\") called the \"way of naginata\" (\"naginata-dō\") or \"new naginata\" (\"atarashii naginata\"), in which competitions are also held.\n\nHowever, many koryu maintain naginatajutsu in their curriculum. Also of note, during the late Edo period, naginata were used to train women and ladies in waiting. Thus, most naginatajutsu styles are headed by women and most naginata practitioners in Japan are women. This has led to the impression overseas that naginatajutsu is a martial art that was not used by male warriors. In fact, naginatajutsu was developed in early medieval Japan and for a time was widely used by samurai.\n\n is the Japanese art of fighting with the spear (\"yari\"). For most of Japan's history, \"sōjutsu\" was practiced extensively by traditional schools. In times of war, it was a primary skill of many soldiers. Today it is a minor art taught in very few schools.\n\n\"Shinobi no jutsu\" (aka \"Ninjutsu\") was developed by groups of people mainly from Iga, Mie and Kōka, Shiga of Japan who became noted for their skills as Infiltrators, scouts, secret agents, and spies. The training of these \"shinobi\" (\"ninja\") can involve disguise, escape, concealment, assassination, archery, medicine, explosives, poisons, black magic, and more.\n\nThe original martial art schools of Japan were almost entirely \"sogo\" (comprehensive) bujutsu. With the long peace of the Tokugawa shogunate there was an increase in specialization with many schools identifying themselves with particular major battlefield weapons. However, there were many additional weapons employed by the warriors of feudal Japan, and an art to wielding each. Usually they were studied as secondary or tertiary weapons within a school but there are exceptions, such as the art of wielding the short staff, (\"jōdō\") which was the primary art taught by the Shintō Musō-ryū.\n\nOther arts existed to teach military skills other than the use of weaponry. Examples of these include marine skills such as swimming and river-fording (\"suijutsu\"), equestrianism (\"bajutsu\"), arson and demolition (\"kajutsu\").\n\n, literally meaning \"modern martial way\", usually applies to arts founded after the beginning of the Meiji Restoration in 1868. Aikido and judo are examples of \"gendai budō\" that were founded in the modern era, while \"iaidō\" represents the modernization of a practice that has existed for centuries.\n\nThe core difference is, as was explained under \"koryū\", above, that \"koryū\" arts are practiced as they were when their primary utility was for use in warfare, while the primary purpose of \"gendai budō\" is for self-improvement, with self-defense as a secondary purpose. Additionally, many of the \"gendai budō\" have included a sporting element to them. Judo and kendo are both examples of this.\n\n, literally meaning \"gentle way\" or \"way of softness\", is a grappling-based martial art, practiced primarily as a sport. It contains substantially the same emphasis on the personal, spiritual, and physical self-improvement of its practitioners as can be found throughout \"gendai budō\".\n\nJudo was created by Kano Jigoro (嘉納 治五郎 \"Kanō Jigorō\", 1860–1938) at the end of the 19th century. Kano took the \"koryū\" martial arts he learned (specifically Kitō-ryū and Tenjin Shin'yo-ryū jujutsu), and systematically reinvented them into a martial art with an emphasis on freestyle practice (randori) and competition, while removing harmful jujutsu techniques or limiting them to the kata. Kano devised a powerful system of new techniques and training methods, which famously culminated on June 11, 1886, in a tournament that would later be dramatized by celebrated Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa (黒沢 明 \"Kurosawa Akira\", 1910–1998), in the film \"Sanshiro Sugata\" (1943).\n\nJudo became an Olympic sport in 1964, and has spread throughout the world. Kano Jigoro's original school, the \"Kodokan\", has students worldwide, and many other schools have been founded by Kano's students.\n\n, meaning the \"way of the sword\", is based on Japanese sword-fighting. It is an evolution of the art of \"kenjutsu\", and its exercises and practice are descended from several particular schools of swordsmanship. The primary technical influence in its development was the \"kenjutsu\" school of Ittō-ryū (founded c. 16th century), whose core philosophy revolved around the concept that all strikes in swordsmanship revolve around the technique \"kiri-oroshi\" (vertical downward cut). Kendo really began to take shape with the introduction of bamboo swords, called \"shinai\", and the set of lightweight wooden armour, called \"bogu\", by Naganuma Sirōzaemon Kunisato (長沼 四郎左衛門 国郷, 1688–1767), which allowed for the practice of strikes at full speed and power without risk of injury to the competitors.\n\nToday, virtually the entire practice of kendo is governed by the All Japan Kendo Federation, founded in 1951. Competitions are judged by points, with the first competitor to score two points on their opponent declared the winner. One point may be scored with a successful and properly executed strike to any of several targets: a thrust to the throat, or a strike to the top of the head, sides of the head, sides of the body, or forearms. Practitioners also compete in forms (\"kata\") competitions, using either wooden or blunted metal swords, according to a set of forms promulgated by the AJKF.\n\n, which would be \"the way of mental presence and immediate reaction\", is nominally the modernization of \"iaijutsu\", but in practice is frequently identical to \"iaijutsu\". The replacement of \"jutsu\" with \"dō\" is part of the 20th century emphasis upon personal and spiritual development; an evolution that took place in many martial arts. In the case of \"iaidō\", some schools merely changed in name without altering the curriculum, and others embraced the wholesale change from a combat-orientation to spiritual growth.\n\n means \"the way to harmony with ki\". It is a Japanese martial art developed by Morihei Ueshiba (植芝 盛平 \"Ueshiba Morihei\", 1883 – 1969). The art consists of \"striking\", \"throwing\" and \"joint locking\" techniques and is known for its fluidity and blending with an attacker, rather than meeting \"force with force\". Emphasis is upon joining with the rhythm and intent of the opponent in order to find the optimal position and timing, when the opponent can be led without force. Aikidō is also known for emphasizing the personal development of its students, reflecting the spiritual background of its founder.\n\nMorihei Ueshiba developed aikido mainly from Daitō-ryū aiki-jūjutsu incorporating training movements such as those for the \"yari\" (spear), \"jō\" (a short quarterstaff), and perhaps also \"juken\" (bayonet). Arguably the strongest influence is that of \"kenjutsu\" and in many ways, an aikidō practitioner moves as an empty handed swordsman.\n\n, which means “way of the bow\", is the modern name for Japanese archery. Originally in Japan, kyujutsu, the “art of the bow\", was a discipline of the samurai, the Japanese warrior class. The bow is a long range weapon that allowed a military unit to engage an opposing force while it was still far away. If the archers were mounted on horseback, they could be used to even more devastating effect as a mobile weapons platform. Archers were also used in sieges and sea battles.\n\nHowever, from the 16th century onward, firearms slowly displaced the bow as the dominant battlefield weapon. As the bow lost its significance as a weapon of war, and under the influence of Buddhism, Shinto, Daoism and Confucianism, Japanese archery evolved into kyudō, the “way of the bow\". In some schools kyudō is practiced as a highly refined contemplative practice, while in other schools it is practiced as a sport.\n\n literally means \"empty hand\". It is also sometimes called .\n\nKarate originated in and, is technically, Okinawan, formerly known as the Ryūkyū Kingdom, but now a part of present-day Japan. Karate is a fusion of pre-existing Okinawan martial arts, called \"te\", and Chinese martial arts. It is an art that has been adopted and developed by practitioners on the Japanese main island of Honshu.\n\nKarate's route to Honshu began with Gichin Funakoshi (船越 義珍 \"Funakoshi Gichin\", 1868–1957), who is called the father of karate, and is the founder of Shotokan karate. Although some Okinawan karate practitioners were already living and teaching in Honshū, Funakoshi gave public demonstrations of karate in Tokyo at a physical education exhibition sponsored by the ministry of education in 1917, and again in 1922. As a result, karate training was subsequently incorporated into Japan's public school system. It was also at this time that the white uniforms and the \"kyū\"/\"dan\" ranking system (both originally implemented by judo's founder, Kano Jigoro) were adopted.\n\nKarate practice is primarily characterized by linear punching and kicking techniques executed from a stable, fixed stance. Many styles of karate practiced today incorporate the forms (\"kata\") originally developed by Funakoshi and his teachers and many different weapons traditionally concealed as farm implements by the peasants of Okinawa. Many karate practitioners also participate in light- and no-contact competitions while some (ex. kyokushin karate) still compete in full-contact competitions with little or no protective gear.\n\n is a post-World War II system of self-defense and self-improvement training (行: \"gyo\" or discipline) known as the modified version of Shaolin Kung Fu. There are two primary technique categories such as \"gōhō\" (strikes, kicks and blocks) and \"jūhō\" (pins, joint locks and dodges). It was established in 1947 by who had been in Manchuria during World War II and who on returning to his native Japan after World War II saw the need to overcome the devastation and re-build self-confidence of the Japanese people on a massive scale. \nAlthough Shorinji Kempo was originally introduced in Japan in the late 1940s and 1950s through large scale programmes involving employees of major national organizations (e.g. Japan Railways) it subsequently became popular in many other countries. Today, according to the World Shorinji Kempo Organization (WSKO), there are almost 1.5 million practitioners in 33 countries.\n\nThe principle of is particularly difficult to describe or explain. The most simple translation of \"aiki\", as \"joining energy\", belies its philosophical depth. Generally, it is the principle of matching your opponent in order to defeat him. It is this concept of \"matching\", or \"joining\", or even \"harmonizing\" (all valid interpretations of \"ai\") that contains the complexity. One may \"match\" the opponent in a clash of force, possibly even resulting in a mutual kill. This is not \"aiki\". \"Aiki\" is epitomized by the notion of joining physically and mentally with the opponent for the express purpose of avoiding a direct clash of force. In practice, \"aiki\" is achieved by first joining with the motion of the opponent (the physical aspect) as well as the intent (the mental portion), then overcoming the will of the opponent, redirecting their motion and intent.\n\nHistorically, this principle was used for destructive purposes; to seize an advantage and kill one's opponent. The modern art of aikido is founded upon the principle that the control of the opponent achieved by the successful application of \"aiki\" may be used to defeat one's opponent without harming them.\n\n\"Kokoro\" (心:こころ) is a concept that crosses through many martial arts, but has no single discrete meaning. Literally translating as \"heart\", in context it can also mean \"character\" or \"attitude.\" Character is a central concept in karate, and in keeping with the \"do\" nature of modern karate, there is a great emphasis on improving oneself. It is often said that the art of karate is for self-defense; not injuring one's opponent is the highest expression of the art. Some popularly repeated quotes implicating this concept include:\n\nLiterally 'martial way' is the Japanese term for martial art.\n\nA code of honor for samurai way of life, in principle similar to chivalry but culturally very different. Literally \"the way of the warrior\", those dedicated to Bushido have exemplary skill with a sword or bow, and can withstand great pain and discomfort. It emphasizes courage, bravery, and loyalty to their lord (daimyō) above all.\n\nShigeru Egami:\n\nWords that I have often heard are that \"everything begins with \"rei\" and ends with \"rei\"\". The word itself, however, can be interpreted in several ways; it is the \"rei\" of \"reigi\" meaning \"etiquette, courtesy, politeness\" and it is also the \"rei\" of \"keirei\", \"salutation\" or \"bow\". The meaning of \"rei\" is sometimes explained in terms of \"kata\" or \"katachi\" (\"formal exercises\" and \"form\" or \"shape\"). It is of prime importance not only in karate but in all modern martial arts. For the purpose in modern martial arts, let us understand \"rei\" as the ceremonial bow in which courtesy and decorum are manifest.\n\nHe who would follow the way of karate must be courteous, not only in training but in daily life. While humble and gentle, he should never be servile. His performance of the kata should reflect boldness and confidence. This seemingly paradoxical combination of boldness and gentleness leads ultimately to harmony. It is true, as Master Funakoshi used to say, that the spirit of karate would be lost without courtesy.\nA term describing 'fighting spirit'.\nIn practical use this often refers to the scream or shout made during an attack, used for proper breathing as well as debilitating or distracting the enemy.\n\nThere are two underlying strategic methodologies to the application of force in Japanese martial arts. One is the , and the other is the . Implicit in these concepts is their separate but equal and interrelated nature, in keeping with their philosophical relationship to the Chinese principles of yin and yang (Jap.: \"in\" and \"yō\").\n\nThe hard method is characterized by the direct application of counter-force to an opposing force. In practice, this may be a direct attack, consisting of movement directly towards the opponent, coinciding with a strike towards the opponent. A defensive technique where the defender stands their ground to block or parry (directly opposing the attack by stopping it or knocking it aside) would be an example of a hard method of defense. Hard method techniques are generally conceptualized as being linear.\n\nThe soft method is characterized by the indirect application of force, which either avoids or redirects the opposing force. For example, receiving an attack by slipping past it, followed by adding force to the attacker's limb for the purpose of unbalancing an attacker is an example of soft method. Soft method techniques are generally conceptualized as being circular.\n\nThese definitions give rise to the often illusory distinction between \"hard-style\" and \"soft-style\" martial arts. In truth, most styles technically practice both, regardless of their internal nomenclature. Analyzing the difference in accordance with yin and yang principles, philosophers would assert that the absence of either one would render the practitioner's skills unbalanced or deficient, as yin and yang alone are each only half of a whole.\n\nOpenings, initiative, and timing are deeply interrelated concepts applicable to self-defense and competitive combat. They each denote different considerations relevant to successfully initiating or countering an attack.\n\nIn Japanese martial arts, is \"the decisive moment when a killing action is initiated.\"\nThere are two types of initiative in Japanese martial arts, , and . Each type of initiative complements the other, and has different advantages and weaknesses. Early initiative is the taking advantage of an opening in an opponent's guard or concentration (\"see \"suki\", supra\"). To fully take the early initiative, the attack launched must be with total commitment and lacking in any hesitation, and virtually ignoring the possibility of a counter-attack by the opponent. Late initiative involves an active attempt to induce an attack by the opponent that will create a weakness in the opponent's defenses, often by faking an opening that is too enticing for the opponent to pass up.\n\nAll of the above concepts are integrated into the idea of the combat . \"Maai\" is a complex concept, incorporating not just the distance between opponents, but also the time it will take to cross the distance, and angle and rhythm of attack. It is specifically the exact \"position\" from which one opponent can strike the other, after factoring in the above elements. For example, a faster opponent's \"maai\" is farther away than a slower opponent. It is ideal for one opponent to maintain \"maai\" while preventing the other from doing so.\n\nThe Three Attacks\nThe principle of Shuhari describes the three stages of learning.\n\nLiterally meaning \"flow\" in Japanese, Ryū is a particular school of an art.\nU.S.A. school of Japanese martial arts. \n\n is the title used for a teacher, in a similar manner to a college 'Professor' in the United States. translates as \"headmaster\" meaning the head of a \"ryu\".\n\nThe relationship between and is one with its origins not in martial arts, but rather in Japanese and Asian culture generally. It underlies Japanese interpersonal relationships in many contexts, such as business, school, and sports. It has become part of the teaching process in Japanese martial arts schools. A senior student is senior to all students who either began training after him or her, or who they outrank. The role of the senior student is crucial to the indoctrination of the junior students to etiquette, work ethic, and other virtues important to the school. The junior student is expected to treat their seniors with respect, and plays an important role in giving the senior students the opportunity to learn leadership skills. Senior students may or may not teach formal classes, but in every respect their role is as a teacher to the junior students, by example and by providing encouragement.\n\nThere are ultimately two ranking systems in the Japanese martial arts, although some schools have been known to blend these two together. The older system, usual prior to 1868, was based a series of licenses or \"menkyo\". There were generally very few levels culminating in the license of total transmission (\"menkyo kaiden\").\n\nIn the modern system, first introduced in the martial arts through judo, students progress by promotion through a series of grades (kyū), followed by a series of degrees (dan), pursuant to formal testing procedures. Some arts use only white and black belts to distinguish between levels, while others use a progression of colored belts for kyū levels.\n\nIt has often been said that forms (\"kata\") are the backbone of the martial arts. Nevertheless, different schools and styles put a varying amount of emphasis upon their practice.\n\n\nHall, David A. \"Encyclopedia of Japanese Martial Arts\". Kodansha USA, 2012. \n"}

Created by writer and director James Cameron, the character is first referred to in the 1984 film \"The Terminator\" and first appears in its 1991 sequel \"\" initially portrayed by Michael Edwards (briefly as the older Connor) and then by teenage actor Edward Furlong throughout the remainder of the film; in addition, Linda Hamilton's real-life son Dalton Abbot played John as a toddler in a dream sequence. The character is subsequently portrayed in the films, Nick Stahl in \"\" (2003), Christian Bale in \"Terminator Salvation\" (2009), Jason Clarke in \"Terminator Genisys\" (2015) and Jude Collie as the young John in the upcoming untitled sixth installment (2019) with Furlong's facial likeness through CGI, as well as the television series Thomas Dekker and John De Vito in \"\" (2008–2009) as the teenager and little John and finally Gideon Emery, who voiced the character in a video game based on the fourth film respectively.\n\nIn the fifth film, John Connor was infected by a Terminator named Alex and becomes the T-3000, which serves as the antagonist of the series.\n\nIn the narrative of his fictional universe, John Connor is a messianic figure (born on 28 February 1985) who will lead the Resistance to defeat an empire of robotic Terminators amassed by Skynet (the rogue military supercomputer) following Judgment Day (a cybernetic revolt doomsday event). When his mother, Sarah Connor, became the target of a time travelling Terminator unit (T-800 (Model 101)) in the first film \"The Terminator\", John sent resistance fighter Kyle Reese to protect her, knowing Kyle and Sarah would later conceive John himself. With foreknowledge from his parents, John fends off Terminator assassination attempts in the second and third films before Judgment Day. In the fourth film, John fights with the Resistance in a post-apocalyptic setting after Skynet has taken over. As the series' central plot heavily involves the concept of time travel, the story of the character is often non-linear and portrays many possible outcomes, for example \"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\", and television series \"Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles\" continue from the ending of \"Terminator 2\" but are depicted as taking place in alternate timelines, while in \"Terminator Genisys\" (2015) revisits and changes the events of 1984's \"The Terminator\".\n\nIn \"The Terminator\", John is mentioned and is the basis of the film. The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is attempting to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) because she will be his mother, but does not make a physical appearance. However, at the end of the film, Sarah is shown to be pregnant with John.\n\nJohn makes his first true appearance in \"\" which takes place in 1995, played by Edward Furlong. He was a 10-year-old juvenile delinquent living with foster parents (Jenette Goldstein and Xander Berkeley) while his mother (Hamilton) was at a hospital for the mentally insane. Though he is informed of his destiny of his future conflict with Skynet, young John is skeptical of his mother's claims of his fate as humanity's leader. One day, while in an arcade with a friend, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) and the T-800 (Schwarzenegger) - a reprogrammed android sent by John's future self, fight over him. This starts a chase sequence where the T-800 and John try to lose the T-1000; this event validates John's mother's warning to him about Skynet. Later that night, his mother breaks out and he and the T-800 go to save her, and the three escape. John teaches The Terminator how to be like a human; teaching him sayings like \"\"hasta la vista\", baby!.\" He forms an emotional bond with the Terminator, coming to regard it as a father figure, and does not want the Terminator to destroy himself at the end of the film, despite the Terminator's warning that allowing him to continue existing creates the risk that his chip could be used to recreate Skynet at some future date. John Connor is briefly seen at the beginning of the film in a flash-forward as an adult, played by Michael Edwards. Dalton Abbot (Linda Hamilton's son), also played John as a toddler in a dream sequence.\n\nThe alternate ending for \"\" depicts Sarah Connor alive and well on August 29, 2029. John Connor has become a U.S. senator and father to a daughter in a world where Skynet was never able to start its war on humanity. While Sarah states that Judgment Day has been averted, John accepts that he still has a destiny to make a difference, which is what motivates him to enter politic, works with likeminded public servants who share his ideals. In contrast to his alternate self from the beginning of the film, John, despite still struggling to improve people's lives in the new timeline, leads a happier life due to not carrying the responsibility and burden of the weight of the world.\n\nIn \"\", which takes place in 2004, John Connor, portrayed by Nick Stahl, is now a young adult. John has been living off-the-grid after the events of the second film, even as the original Judgment Day deadline on August 29, 1997 came to pass without incident. His mother eventually developed terminal leukemia and died. In the film, John crosses paths with Katherine \"Kate\" Brewster (Claire Danes), a former classmate from when he was living with his foster parents. He is attacked by a T-X Terminator (Kristanna Loken), which was sent from the future. Unlike its predecessors, the T-X's objective was to terminate his future officers as secondary targets because John's location was unknown. When it encounters John it changes its priority to focus entirely on him and Kate. A protector T-850 (Schwarzenegger), who is a doppelgänger of John's previous protector, is also sent back in time to protect him, explaining that Judgment Day had only been delayed to July 25, 2004, which happens to be only hours away. The T-850 also states that it was not sent from the future by John, but by Kate in 2033, who is his future wife and second-in-command - John had actually been killed by that very Terminator on July 4, 2032, as Skynet believed it to be the most suitable for such a mission due to John's emotional attachment to its model. Although John and Kate spend much of the film trying to halt the launching of Skynet, they are misled to believe Skynet's core is in an underground facility, only to find themselves locked and protected in a secure bunker as the first nuclear assault is launched on the United States as a result of Skynet's manipulations; Lieutenant General Robert Brewster, who was Skynet's creator and Kate's father, mislead them to the bunker in order to assure Kate's protection, and Skynet is pure software and has already spread to every server worldwide therefore impossible to shutdown. It is via the radios in this bunker that John begins to broadcast messages to lay the groundwork to help survivors and organize the Resistance.\n\nIn \"Terminator Salvation\", which is set fourteen years later in the year 2018, John Connor, portrayed by Christian Bale, is now an older, battle-experienced, Resistance soldier married to Kate Brewster (Bryce Dallas Howard), who serves as a medic and is now pregnant with his child. Kate also assists command with her husband's Tech-Com unit. Since Judgment Day, John has been broadcasting radio messages to both the Resistance forces and surviving refugees in an effort to maintain morale and hope. The story features a new character named Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), and a younger Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin). John starts as one of the many foot soldiers who make up the Resistance movement based in California. Despite having extensive prior knowledge of the machines and Skynet's capabilities, John is largely dismissed by General Hugh Ashdown (Michael Ironside) who runs the resistance organization. He considers Connor a delusional false prophet at best and a dangerous liability to their operations at worst. Nonetheless, there are pockets of people within the Resistance who have come to believe in John's experiences and judgment based on their own first hand experiences serving with him. In addition, the majority of the Resistance is gradually losing faith towards the Resistance Command due to Ashdown's ruthless and vicious tactics that cost many of his own soldiers and civilians' lives. Later on, towards the middle of the film, John learns that Kyle Reese has been placed in a detention center by Skynet which is aware of Kyle's future role as John's father, classifying Kyle as its primary target and John as its secondary objective even over the current leaders of the resistance- and sets out to rescue him, with Marcus Wright leading him to the base. Upon arrival, John faces off with a T-800 crafted in the image of the android unit that he and his family have encountered previously. John is hurt during his encounter with the T-800 and receives multiple cuts to the face, mirroring the same scars seen on John's face in the opening scene of \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\". Marcus helps him destroy the T-800, but due to injury, John's heart is too badly damaged and Marcus offers his own to John. In addition, after the Resistance Command is caught into Skynet's trap, John and his subordinates takeover the authority of its forces with no opposition. John's ending statement is that though this battle has been won, the war is far from over.\n\nJohn Connor is portrayed by Jason Clarke in the fifth installment, \"Terminator Genisys.\" In an alternate timeline, following a confrontation with a T-5000 (Matt Smith) on the seemingly final day of the war, just as Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) is being sent back to save Sarah (Emilia Clarke), John is forcibly transformed into a nanocyte cyborg, the T-3000, the process changing his allegiance from the resistance to Skynet and becomes sociopathic. Skynet then sends the T-3000 back in time to ensure its creation in the altered timeline- now 'believing' that the future requires man and machine to come together like he has – in a parallel change with the Terminator from \"The Terminator\" to \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\". After being converted he travels back in time to 2014 and joins Cyberdyne to help create a new version of Skynet after the destruction of the original Terminator prevented its chip being used, working with Miles and Danny Dyson to perfect the development of the new Genisys system, turning Skynet into a massive digital network rather than a single computer system like it was originally. Three years later, despite his superior physical strength, he was later destroyed by \"The Guardian\" Terminator (Schwarzenegger)- a T-800 reprogrammed and sent into the past by an unknown party to protect Sarah Connor- when both of them were trapped inside a prototype time machine; with the machine just capable of generating the electromagnetic energy that prevented non-living tissue travelling through time without actually generating a temporal portal, Connor is ripped apart while trapped at the heart of the machine after earlier battle-damage disrupted his ability to maintain his organic shell, while the 'Guardian' is thrown out of the machine and falls into a nearby pool of poly-mimetic alloy, allowing its CPU and what remained of its endoskeleton to be absorbed by the metal and convert it into a nano-android similar to the T-1000. It is ambiguous as to whether a version of John Connor will exist in the altered timeline, with John himself stating that his existence is a paradox that is no longer tied to Sarah and Kyle conceiving him (though this view may be attributed to his semi-insanity after his transformation).\n\nThe T-3000's sole mission is to protect and ensure the ultimate survival of Skynet, which seeks to eliminate the human race with its global machine network. The T-3000 describes itself as neither machine nor human; rather, it is a hybrid nanotechnological cyborg. Producer David Ellison explains that the title \"Terminator Genisys\" \"[is] in reference to genesis, which is in reference to the singularity and the man-machine hybrid that John Connor ends up being.\"\n\nThe on-screen representation of the T-3000 was made by British effects company Double Negative. Footage combines Jason Clarke filmed on set, keyframed animation, and motion capture. Supervisor Peter Bebb said that the company tried to design the T-3000 like a computer would do it, focusing on design and battle efficiency, \"form follows function\". Given it is a Terminator built out of a human, the result is \"a pure robot that sits under flesh structure\", still retaining an overall human shape. The mechanical cells tried to resemble the material on stealth aircraft, with a result described as \"more matte than metal\", resembling a slightly iridescent ceramic carbon.\n\nJohn will be portrayed by Jude Collie in the series' upcoming sixth film with Furlong's 1991 facial likeness being used via CGI.\n\nThomas Dekker portrays John Connor in the parallel universe television series, \"\". John is Sarah's son and the future leader of the human resistance. He is only fifteen years old at the beginning of the show, turning sixteen in the season one finale, and seventeen throughout season two, although it isn't mentioned. As the series progresses, John struggles with his feelings for Cameron, who is a Terminator. John De Vito plays a young John Connor in two episodes \"Queen's Gambit\" and \"To the Lighthouse\".\n\nDekker was cast after Headey secured the role of Sarah Connor. Regarding the \"Terminator\" films, Dekker says \"They are like my favorite films when I was younger. So it's very ironic that I'm getting to do this. And I know for the younger generation and for myself, John was equally important to me as Sarah was, and I know a lot of the people that I hear from really, really care about John\". Dekker describes his character as \"a continuation of Eddie Furlong's character\" but \"he's in a darker, more mature place now\".\n\nThe show tells the story of the Connors in alternate timeline from \"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\". It branches off from the shared back story of \"Terminator 2\", and according to consulting producer James Middleton \"is [a new] version of \"T3\".\"\n\nAt the beginning of the series in 1999, John and Sarah try to settle down to normal lives after the events of the second film, but they are in fear of being captured for blowing up Cyberdyne during the events of the second film. While at school, John is attacked by a Terminator posing as a teacher, and is protected by a reprogrammed Terminator named \"Cameron\". John learns that Judgment Day has not been prevented, only postponed to April 21, 2011. John does not want to run anymore and asks Sarah to stop Skynet from being created. Cameron uses time dilation technology (built by \"The Engineer\" from the future) to send all three of them to 2007, just before Skynet is created, so that they can stop it.\n\nSettling down in 2007, John enrolls in Campo de Cahuenga High School under the name of John Baum, after author L. Frank Baum who wrote \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\", a book that Sarah says was John's favorite when he was younger, where he is friends with his fellow students and Riley Dawson. He becomes acquainted with his father's older brother, Derek Reese, who is also a resistance fighter sent back in time to help them. This version of John is shown to be a highly skilled computer hacker (a nod from \"Terminator 2\"), even being able to hack into 's CPU in order to read the information it contains, as well as easily hacking into the LAPD database. He claims that he could hack a computer system 'in (his) sleep'. He is also proficient in chess, lock-picking, self-defense, and weaponry, all of which were part of his training during his childhood. The relationship dynamic between John and Cameron is different than with the \"Uncle Bob\" T-800 by virtue of her size/gender, with some degree of sexual tension. He also develops a relationship with Riley Dawson, a high school classmate, who, unknown to him, is also from the future and working with Jesse Flores, a resistance fighter and lover of Derek Reese. Jesse's plan was for John to become infatuated with Riley, making her a threat to John's security. This would force Cameron to kill Riley, thereby alienating John from her. Apparently, after Judgment Day, rumors abound of an unnatural relationship between the two that affects John's tactical decision making, and some are unsettled that he has appointed a Terminator as one of his lieutenants.\n\nIn the video game \"Terminator Salvation\", which is set two years before the events of the film. In 2016, John Connor (voiced by Gideon Emery) and Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood) are on a mission to rescue a man named David Weston (Sean Cory Cooper), until they team up with Angie Salter (Rose McGowan) and Barnes (Common) to fight the machines.\n\nEdward Furlong reprises his role from \"Terminator 2\" in this Universal Studios attraction. Set six years after the events of the second film, John and Sarah once again attempt to prevent Judgment Day by infiltrating Cyberdyne to prevent the completion of Skynet. They interrupt Kimberley Duncan's presentation of the T-70 Terminators and attempt to evacuate the facility, but the T-1000 arrives and nearly terminates them. However, the T-800 arrives from the future and saves them. The T-800 and John then travel to the future while Sarah stays behind. In the future, they journey across the post apocalyptic landscape, towards Skynet, and are chased by various machines. Eventually, John and the T-800 reach Skynet, housed inside a giant, glowing pyramid. They descend to Skynet Central Core where they face off the T-1000000, a giant liquid-metal spider-like Terminator that guards the CPU. As they run out of time, the T-800 sends John back to the present. After John makes his return, the T-800 destroys itself, the T-1000000, and Skynet in a massive explosion. Back in the present, John and Sarah are reunited.\n\nWith the success of \"T2\", John Connor would appear in the non-canon Terminator/Superman crossover \"\", where DC Comics and Dark Horse Comics teamed Sarah and John Connor up with the Man of Steel in an adventure that pitted Superman up against not only Skynet, but also against his old rival The Cyborg. In this adventure, while trying to protect Sarah and young John, Superman is pulled into the future - the resistance had attempted to recover a Terminator that Skynet had sent back earlier but the machine targeted Superman by mistake, and is then able to help the older John, as well as an older John Henry Irons (AKA Steel) take down Skynet once and for all. Meanwhile, back in the past Cyborg makes a deal with Skynet - leaving a message in a Terminator's skull about Superman's weaknesses and subsequently allying himself with a T-X sent back from the future to assist him, while Supergirl, Superboy, and even Lex Luthor continue to protect Sarah and young John from wave after wave of Terminator cyborgs, the later models being specifically upgraded to cope with the Superman family. The story concludes with Superman having aided the resistance in destroying Skynet by detonating an EMP in Earth's atmosphere powerful enough to shut down Earth's machines before returning to the past, where the Cyborg is defeated and all Terminator components disposed of in the sun. However, at the end of the comic it is revealed that Lex Luthor has multiple parts of other Terminators. He was continuing to research them since he never was able to capture a fully functional Terminator. This leads the reader to believe that Luthor played a hand in Skynet's creation in the future.\n"}

Van Driem postulates the Burusho people took part in the Indo-Aryan migration out of Central Asia that resulted in the Indo-European conquest of the Indian sub-continent, while other Karasuk peoples migrated northwards to become the Yeniseians. These claims have recently been picked up by anthropologist and linguist Roger Blench.\n\nThe evidence for Karasuk is mostly in the verbal and nominal morphology. For example, the second-person singular prefixes on intransitive verbs are in Burushaski and in Ket. Ket has two verbal declensions, one prefixed with \"d-\" and one with \"b-\", and Burushaski likewise has two, one prefixed with \"d-\" and one without such a marker. However, neither the Burushaski nor the Yeniseian verbal morphology has been rigorously analysed, and reviewers have found the evidence to be weak.\n\nWhile Yeniseian has been proposed to be related to the Na-Dene languages of North America, as part of a newly named Dene–Yeniseian family, the relevant morphological correspondences between Na-Dene and Yeniseian have not been found in Burushaski.\n"}

{"id": "193132", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=193132", "title": "Nuclear family", "text": "Nuclear family\n\nA nuclear family, elementary family or conjugal family is a family group consisting of two parents and their children (one or more). It is in contrast to a single-parent family, to the larger extended family, and to a family with more than two parents. Nuclear families typically center on a married couple; the nuclear family may have any number of children. There are differences in definition among observers; some definitions allow only biological children that are full-blood siblings, but others allow for a stepparent and any mix of dependent children including stepchildren and adopted children; as well as the expansion to include same-sex couples. \n\nFamily structures of a married couple and their children were present in Western Europe and New England in the 17th century, influenced by church and theocratic governments. With the emergence of proto-industrialization and early capitalism, the nuclear family became a financially viable social unit. The term \"nuclear family\" first appeared in the early twentieth century. Alternative definitions have evolved to include family units headed by same-sex parents and perhaps additional adult relatives who take on a cohabiting parental role; in the latter case, it also receives the name of conjugal family.\n\nThe concept that narrowly defines a nuclear family is central to stability in modern society that has been promoted by familialists who are social conservatives in the United States, and has been challenged as historically and sociologically inadequate to describe the complexity of actual family relations. In \"Freudian Theories of Identification and Their Derivatives\" Urie Bronfenbrenner states, \"Very little is known about the extent variation in the behavior of fathers and mothers towards sons and daughters, and even less about the possible effects on such differential treatment.\" Little is known about how parental behavior and identification processes work, and how children interpret sex role learning. In his theory he uses \"identification\" with the father in the sense that the son will follow the sex role provided by his father and then for the father to be able identify the difference of the \"cross sex\" parent for his daughter.\n\nHistorians Alan Macfarlane and Peter Laslett postulated that nuclear families have been a primary arrangement in England since the 13th century. This primary arrangement was different than the normal arrangements in Southern Europe, in parts of Asia, and the Middle East where it was common for young adults to remain in or marry into the family home. In England multi-generational households were uncommon because young adults would save enough money to move out, into their own household once they married. Sociologist Brigitte Berger argued, \"the young nuclear family had to be flexible and mobile as it searched for opportunity and property. Forced to rely on their own ingenuity, its members also needed to plan for the future and develop bourgeois habits of work and saving.\" Berge also mentions that this could be one of the reasons why the Industrial Revolution began in England and other Northwest European countries. However, the historicity of the nuclear family in England has been challenged by Cord Oestmann.\n\nAs a fertility factor, single nuclear family households generally have a higher number of children than co-operative living arrangements according to studies from both the Western world and India.\n\nThere have been studies done that shows a difference in the number of children wanted per household according to where they live. Families that live in rural areas wanted to have more kids than families in urban areas. A study done in Japan between October 2011 and February 2012 further researched the effect of area of residence on mean desired number of children. Researchers of the study came to the conclusion that the women living in rural areas with larger families were more likely to want more children, compared to women that lived in urban areas in Japan.\n\nMerriam-Webster dates the term back to 1947, while the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" has a reference to the term from 1925; thus it is relatively new.\n\nIn its most common usage, the term \"nuclear family\" refers to a household consisting of a father, a mother and their children all in one household dwelling. George Murdock, an observer of families, offered an early description: \n\nMany individuals are part of two nuclear families in their lives: the family of origin in which they are offspring, and the family of procreation in which they are a parent.\n\nWhile the phrase dates approximately from the Atomic Age, the term \"nuclear\" is not used here in the context of nuclear warfare or nuclear power, but instead originates in the same way as nuclear fission, from the noun \"nucleus\", itself originating in the Latin \"nux\", meaning \"nut\", i.e. the core of something – thus, the nuclear family refers to all members of the family being part of the same core rather than directly to atomic weapons.\n\nAn extended family group consists of non-nuclear (or \"non-immediate\") family members considered together with nuclear (or \"immediate\") family members. When extended family is involved they also influence children's development just as much as the parents would on their own. In an extended family resources are usually shared among those involved adding more of a community aspect to the family unit. This is not just talking about sharing money and physical thing but includes sharing time for example extended family such as grandparents can watch over their grandchildren allowing parents to continue and pursue careers and creating a healthy and supportive environment the children to grow up in and allows the parents to have much less stress. Extended families help keep the kids in the family healthier because of all the resources the kids get now that they have other individuals able to help them and support them as they grow up.\n\nIn 2005, information from the United States Census Bureau showed that 70% of children in the US live in two-parent families, with 66% of those living with parents who were married, and 60% living with their biological parents. The information also explained that \"the figures suggest that the tumultuous shifts in family structure since the late 1960s have leveled off since 1990\".\n\nWhen considered separately from couples without children, single-parent families, and unmarried couples with children, the United States nuclear families appear to constitute a minority of households – with a rising prevalence of other family arrangements. In 2000, nuclear families with the original biological parents constituted roughly 24.10% of American households, compared with 40.30% in 1970. Roughly two-thirds of all children in the United States will spend at least some time in a single-parent household. According to some sociologists, \"[The nuclear family] no longer seems adequate to cover the wide diversity of household arrangements we see today.\" (Edwards 1991; Stacey 1996). A new term has been introduced, \"postmodern family\", intended to describe the great variability in family forms, including single-parent families and couples without children.\" Nuclear family households are now less common compared to household with couples without children, single-parent families, and unmarried couples with children.\n\nIn the UK, the number of nuclear families fell from 39.0% of all households in 1968 to 28.0% in 1992. The decrease accompanied an equivalent increase in the number of single-parent households and in the number of adults living alone.\n\nAccording to some sociologists, \"[The nuclear family] no longer seems adequate to cover the wide diversity of household arrangements we see today.\" (Edwards 1991; Stacey 1996). A new term has been introduced, \"postmodern family\", intended to describe the great variability in family forms, including single-parent families and couples without children.\"\n\nProfessor Wolfgang Haak of Adelaide University, detects traces of the nuclear family in prehistoric Central Europe. A 2005 archeological dig in Elau in Germany, analyzed by Haak, revealed genetic evidence suggesting that the 13 individuals found in a grave were closely related. Haak said, \"By establishing the genetic links between the two adults and two children buried together in one grave, we have established the presence of the classic nuclear family in a prehistoric context in Central Europe... Their unity in death suggest[s] a unity in life.\" This paper does not regard the nuclear family as \"natural\" or as the only model for human family life. \"This does not establish the elemental family to be a universal model or the most ancient institution of human communities. For example, polygamous unions are prevalent in ethnographic data and models of household communities have apparently been involving a high degree of complexity from their origins.\" In this study evidence suggests that the nuclear family was embedded with an extended family. The remains of three children (probably siblings based on DNA evidence) were found buried with a woman who was not their mother but may have been an \"aunt or a step-mother\".\n\nFor social conservatism in the United States and Canada, the idea that the nuclear family is traditional is an important aspect, where family is seen as the primary unit of society. These movements oppose alternative family forms and social institutions that are seen by them to undermine parental authority. The numbers of nuclear families is slowly dwindling in the US as more women pursue higher education, develop professional lives, and delay having children until later in their life. Children and marriage have become less appealing as many women continue to face societal, familial, and/or peer pressure to give up their education and successful career to focus on stabilizing the home. As diversity in the United States continues to increase, it is becoming difficult for the classically traditional family unit—a heterosexual couple of the same race and ethnicity with two children—to stay the norm, calling the relevancy of North American Conservatism into question. Data from 2014 also suggests that single parents and the likelihood of children living with one is also determined by race. Pew Research Center has found that 54% of African-American individuals will be single parents compared to 19% of Caucasian individuals.Several factors account for the differences in family structure including economic and social class. Differences in education level also change the amount of single parents. In 2014, those with less than a high school education are 46% more likely to be a single parent compared to 12% who have graduated college.\n\nCritics of the term \"traditional family\" point out that in most cultures and at most times, the extended family model has been most common, not the nuclear family, though it has had a longer tradition in England than in other parts of Europe and Asia which contributed large numbers of immigrants to the Americas. The nuclear family became the most common form in the U.S. in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n"}

According to Know Your Meme, the genre was created with the intent of becoming viral. Some common characteristics of satirical hip hop include lo-fi production, simplistic music videos, lazy rhymes, and intentionally stereotypical lyrics/topics. Another major characteristic associated with meme rap is the use of alternate personas, which is also a staple in comedy. Internet personality George \"Joji\" Miller (better known as Filthy Frank), for example, occasionally performed under the alter ego \"Pink Guy,\" a main character in his now-defunct \"Filthy Frank\" YouTube series. The character of Pink Guy is known for performing many absurdist comedy rap songs.\n\nThe earliest example of satirical hip hop can be traced back to the works of \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, who has made parody tracks of popular hip hop songs since the 1990s. Another early example is with Southern California-based rapper Afroman, with his two well-known tracks \"Crazy Rap\" and \"Because I Got High,\" both released in 2001, featuring comedic lyrics.\n\nIn 2008, Odd Future members Tyler, the Creator and Jasper Dolphin released the sole EP under their short-lived comedy group name \"I Smell Panties.\" The duo utilized elements of gangsta rap and Southern hip hop in a satirical way when performing as I Smell Panties. Tyler then released a track in 2011 called \"Come Through Looking Clean\", a joke song performed under a character named \"Young Nigga.\" It's a parody of the \"Bling Era\" of hip hop that was popular during the 2000s and draws heavy inspiration from the music of Lil B. The Young Nigga character would later be re-used on various skits in the 2012 Adult Swim program Loiter Squad, which was created by and starred members of Odd Future. In February 2016, Tyler revealed that his 2011 breakout viral single \"Yonkers\" was made as a joke song attempting to parody the style of New York rappers (hence the title of \"Yonkers\").\n\nMichigan-based Internet celebrity and rapper Rucka Rucka Ali became famous in the late 2000s/early 2010s for creating pop song parodies (including parodies of popular hip hop songs) containing lyrics for shock value. He often includes juvenile references to ethnic stereotypes, topical subject matter, and dark humor. His music also tends to make use of comedic portrayals of celebrities in the same vein to the animated comedy series \"South Park\", and his several alter egos espouses stereotypical qualities of specific ethnic groups; his alter egos include DJ Not Nice (Asian), Seymour Schwartz (Jewish), and Toby Queef (White-American redneck). Some critics have labeled Ali as a racist as a reaction to his songs, although his humor seems heavily influenced by mainstream comedy television shows, such as \"South Park\", \"Family Guy\", and \"Chappelle's Show\", and has jokingly defended his brand of humor by claiming that he's \"stating objective facts\" when he references stereotypes in his songs. His videos and YouTube channels are frequently removed (since he started creating music videos he has had 17 YouTube channels deleted for terms of service violations), but are reuploaded by his fans.\nIn the mid-2010s, Ryan Harryman, a San Jose State University student and member of the school's water polo club team, became a viral sensation on the Internet under the stage name \"3PAC.\" He was known for his self-produced music videos, bombastic and aggressive comedic rap songs, and diss tracks targeting mainstream rappers like Eminem and 2 Chainz, as well as YouTube gaming channel PewDiePie. 3PAC made a guest appearance on \"The New CALassic\", a comedy hip hop mixtape performed by Internet music critic Anthony Fantano (under his \"Cal Chuchesta\" alter ego) that was released in August 2015. Harryman died at the age of 24 in October 2015 after suffering severe brain damage during a water polo practice.\n\nThe seventh track of underground rapper Hopsin's 2015 album \"Pound Syndrome\", entitled \"No Words\", is a skit meant to both satirize and criticize the trend of mumble rap that was popular during that time, calling rappers (specifically to artists like Future, Young Thug, and Migos) who are a part of that subgenre \"mentally retarded\" and also mocking fans of mumble rap.\n\nIn 2017, YouTube personality Filthy Frank released a music project titled \"Pink Season\", the second album performed under the name \"Pink Guy\", with some songs poking fun at hip hop music as a whole, among other things. The track \"Hand On My Gat\" for example, features a character named PolitikZ that acts as a caricature for hardcore underground rappers; that character's previous appearance was on the Filthy Frank video \"BAD INTERNET RAPPERS\" (uploaded in November 2014), where he performed a song called \"Real Hip Hop\" that directly parodied the stereotypical anti-mainstream and politically charged attitudes of underground rappers. The \"Pink Season\" album reached number one on the iTunes charts and peaked at 70 on the Billboard 200. In January 2018, nearly a month after the retirement of the \"Filthy Frank\" project, George Miller returned to performing as Pink Guy to co-star in a music video made by Lil Toenail, a Florida-based meme rapper who performs with a giant foot costume and ski mask to maintain his anonymity.\n\nIn April 2018, Internet personality and music critic Anthony Fantano began releasing more satirical hip hop tracks under his Cal Chuchesta alter ego, releasing the tracks \"Coin Star\" and \"Don't Talk To Me.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "7627", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7627", "title": "The Canterbury Tales", "text": "The Canterbury Tales\n\nThe Canterbury Tales () is a collection of 24 stories that runs to over 17,000 lines written in Middle English by Geoffrey Chaucer between 1387 and 1400. In 1386, Chaucer became Controller of Customs and Justice of Peace and, in 1389, Clerk of the King's work. It was during these years that Chaucer began working on his most famous text, \"The Canterbury Tales\". The tales (mostly written in verse, although some are in prose) are presented as part of a story-telling contest by a group of pilgrims as they travel together from London to Canterbury to visit the shrine of Saint Thomas Becket at Canterbury Cathedral. The prize for this contest is a free meal at the Tabard Inn at Southwark on their return.\n\nAfter a long list of works written earlier in his career, including \"Troilus and Criseyde\", \"House of Fame\", and \"Parliament of Fowls\", \"The Canterbury Tales\" is near-unanimously seen as Chaucer's \"magnum opus\". He uses the tales and descriptions of its characters to paint an ironic and critical portrait of English society at the time, and particularly of the Church. Chaucer's use of such a wide range of classes and types of people was without precedent in English. Although the characters are fictional, they still offer a variety of insights into customs and practices of the time. Often, such insight leads to a variety of discussions and disagreements among people in the 14th century. For example, although various social classes are represented in these stories and all of the pilgrims are on a spiritual quest, it is apparent that they are more concerned with worldly things than spiritual. Structurally, the collection resembles Giovanni Boccaccio's \"The Decameron\", which Chaucer may have read during his first diplomatic mission to Italy in 1372.\n\nIt has been suggested that the greatest contribution of \"The Canterbury Tales\" to English literature was the popularisation of the English vernacular in mainstream literature, as opposed to French, Italian or Latin. English had, however, been used as a literary language centuries before Chaucer's time, and several of Chaucer's contemporaries—John Gower, William Langland, the Pearl Poet, and Julian of Norwich—also wrote major literary works in English. It is unclear to what extent Chaucer was seminal in this evolution of literary preference.\n\nWhile Chaucer clearly states the addressees of many of his poems, the intended audience of \"The Canterbury Tales\" is more difficult to determine. Chaucer was a courtier, leading some to believe that he was mainly a court poet who wrote exclusively for nobility.\n\n\"The Canterbury Tales\" is generally thought to have been incomplete at the end of Chaucer's life. In the General Prologue, some 30 pilgrims are introduced. According to the Prologue, Chaucer's intention was to write four stories from the perspective of each pilgrim, two each on the way to and from their ultimate destination, St. Thomas Becket's shrine (making for a total of about 120 stories). Although perhaps incomplete, \"The Canterbury Tales\" is revered as one of the most important works in English literature. It is also open to a wide range of interpretations.\n\nThe question of whether \"The Canterbury Tales\" is a finished work has not been answered to date. There are 84 manuscripts and four incunabula (printed before c 1540) editions of the work, dating from the late medieval and early Renaissance periods, more than for any other vernacular literary text with the exception of \"The Prick of Conscience\". This is taken as evidence of the \"Tales\"' popularity during the century after Chaucer's death. Fifty-five of these manuscripts are thought to have been originally complete, while 28 are so fragmentary that it is difficult to ascertain whether they were copied individually or as part of a set. The \"Tales\" vary in both minor and major ways from manuscript to manuscript; many of the minor variations are due to copyists' errors, while it is suggested that in other cases Chaucer both added to his work and revised it as it was being copied and possibly as it was being distributed. Determining the text of the work is complicated by the question of the narrator's voice which Chaucer made part of his literary structure. \n\nEven the oldest surviving manuscripts of the \"Tales\" are not Chaucer's originals. The very oldest is probably MS Peniarth 392 D (called \"Hengwrt\"), written by a scribe shortly after Chaucer's death. The most beautiful, on the other hand, is the Ellesmere Manuscript, a manuscript handwritten by one person with illustrations by several illustrators; the tales are put in an order that many later editors have followed for centuries. The first version of \"The Canterbury Tales\" to be published in print was William Caxton's 1476 edition. Only 10 copies of this edition are known to exist, including one held by the British Library and one held by the Folger Shakespeare Library. \n\nIn 2004, Linne Mooney claimed that she was able to identify the scrivener who worked for Chaucer as an Adam Pinkhurst. Mooney, then a professor at the University of Maine and a visiting fellow at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, said she could match Pinkhurst's signature, on an oath he signed, to his handwriting on a copy of \"The Canterbury Tales\" that might have been transcribed from Chaucer's working copy. That identification has been questioned and doubted by others and is being debated.\n\nIn the absence of consensus as to whether or not a complete version of the \"Tales\" exists, there is also no general agreement regarding the order in which Chaucer intended the stories to be placed.\n\nTextual and manuscript clues have been adduced to support the two most popular modern methods of ordering the tales. Some scholarly editions divide the \"Tales\" into ten \"Fragments\". The tales that make up a Fragment are closely related and contain internal indications of their order of presentation, usually with one character speaking to and then stepping aside for another character. However, between Fragments, the connection is less obvious. Consequently, there are several possible orders; the one most frequently seen in modern editions follows the numbering of the Fragments (ultimately based on the Ellesmere order). Victorians frequently used the nine \"Groups\", which was the order used by Walter William Skeat whose edition \"Chaucer: Complete Works\" was used by Oxford University Press for most of the twentieth century, but this order is now seldom followed.\n\nAn alternative ordering (seen in an early manuscript containing \"The Canterbury Tales\", the early-fifteenth century Harley MS. 7334) places Fragment VIII before VI. Fragments I and II almost always follow each other, just as VI and VII, IX and X do in the oldest manuscripts. Fragments IV and V, by contrast, vary in location from manuscript to manuscript.\n\nChaucer wrote in late Vernacular Middle English, which has clear differences from Modern English. From philological research, we know certain facts about the pronunciation of English during the time of Chaucer. Chaucer pronounced \"-e\" at the end of words, so that \"care\" was , not as in Modern English. Other silent letters were also pronounced, so that the word \"knight\" was , with both the \"k\" and the \"gh\" pronounced, not . In some cases, vowel letters in Middle English were pronounced very differently from Modern English, because the Great Vowel Shift had not yet happened. For instance, the long \"e\" in \"wepyng\" \"weeping\" was pronounced as , as in modern German or Italian, not as . Below is an IPA transcription of the opening lines of \"The Merchant's Prologue\":\n\nAlthough no manuscript exists in Chaucer's own hand, two were copied around the time of his death by Adam Pinkhurst, a scribe with whom he seems to have worked closely before, giving a high degree of confidence that Chaucer himself wrote the \"Tales\". Because the final \"-e\" sound was lost soon after Chaucer's time, scribes did not accurately copy it, and this gave scholars the impression that Chaucer himself was inconsistent in using it. It has now been established, however, that \"-e\" was an important part of Chaucer's grammar, and helped to distinguish singular adjectives from plural and subjunctive verbs from indicative.\n\nNo other work prior to Chaucer's is known to have set a collection of tales within the framework of pilgrims on a pilgrimage. It is obvious, however, that Chaucer borrowed portions, sometimes very large portions, of his stories from earlier stories, and that his work was influenced by the general state of the literary world in which he lived. Storytelling was the main entertainment in England at the time, and storytelling contests had been around for hundreds of years. In 14th-century England the English Pui was a group with an appointed leader who would judge the songs of the group. The winner received a crown and, as with the winner of \"The Canterbury Tales\", a free dinner. It was common for pilgrims on a pilgrimage to have a chosen \"master of ceremonies\" to guide them and organise the journey. Harold Bloom suggests that the structure is mostly original, but inspired by the \"pilgrim\" figures of Dante and Virgil in \"The Divine Comedy\". New research suggests that the General Prologue, in which the innkeeper and host Harry Bailey introduces each pilgrim, is a pastiche of the historical Harry Bailey's surviving 1381 poll-tax account of Southwark's inhabitants.\n\n\"The Decameron\" by Giovanni Boccaccio contains more parallels to \"The Canterbury Tales\" than any other work. Like the \"Tales\", it features a number of narrators who tell stories along a journey they have undertaken (to flee from the Black Death). It ends with an apology by Boccaccio, much like Chaucer's Retraction to the \"Tales\". A quarter of the tales in \"The Canterbury Tales\" parallel a tale in the \"Decameron\", although most of them have closer parallels in other stories. Some scholars thus find it unlikely that Chaucer had a copy of the work on hand, surmising instead that he must have merely read the \"Decameron\" at some point, while a new study claims he had a copy of the \"Decameron\" and used it extensively as he began work on his own collection. Each of the tales has its own set of sources that have been suggested by scholars, but a few sources are used frequently over several tales. They include poetry by Ovid, the Bible in one of the many vulgate versions in which it was available at the time (the exact one is difficult to determine), and the works of Petrarch and Dante. Chaucer was the first author to use the work of these last two, both Italians. Boethius' \"Consolation of Philosophy\" appears in several tales, as the works of John Gower do. Gower was a known friend to Chaucer. A full list is impossible to outline in little space, but Chaucer also, lastly, seems to have borrowed from numerous religious encyclopaedias and liturgical writings, such as John Bromyard's \"Summa praedicantium\", a preacher's handbook, and Jerome's \"Adversus Jovinianum\". Many scholars say there is a good possibility Chaucer met Petrarch or Boccaccio.\n\n\"The Canterbury Tales\" is a collection of stories built around a frame narrative or frame tale, a common and already long established genre of its period. Chaucer's \"Tales\" differs from most other story \"collections\" in this genre chiefly in its intense variation. Most story collections focused on a theme, usually a religious one. Even in the \"Decameron\", storytellers are encouraged to stick to the theme decided on for the day. The idea of a pilgrimage to get such a diverse collection of people together for literary purposes was also unprecedented, though \"the association of pilgrims and storytelling was a familiar one\". Introducing a competition among the tales encourages the reader to compare the tales in all their variety, and allows Chaucer to showcase the breadth of his skill in different genres and literary forms.\n\nWhile the structure of the \"Tales\" is largely linear, with one story following another, it is also much more than that. In the \"General Prologue\", Chaucer describes not the tales to be told, but the people who will tell them, making it clear that structure will depend on the characters rather than a general theme or moral. This idea is reinforced when the Miller interrupts to tell his tale after the Knight has finished his. Having the Knight go first gives one the idea that all will tell their stories by class, with the Monk following the Knight. However, the Miller's interruption makes it clear that this structure will be abandoned in favour of a free and open exchange of stories among all classes present. General themes and points of view arise as the characters tell their tales, which are responded to by other characters in their own tales, sometimes after a long lapse in which the theme has not been addressed.\n\nLastly, Chaucer does not pay much attention to the progress of the trip, to the time passing as the pilgrims travel, or to specific locations along the way to Canterbury. His writing of the story seems focused primarily on the stories being told, and not on the pilgrimage itself.\n\nThe variety of Chaucer's tales shows the breadth of his skill and his familiarity with many literary forms, linguistic styles, and rhetorical devices. Medieval schools of rhetoric at the time encouraged such diversity, dividing literature (as Virgil suggests) into high, middle, and low styles as measured by the density of rhetorical forms and vocabulary. Another popular method of division came from St. Augustine, who focused more on audience response and less on subject matter (a Virgilian concern). Augustine divided literature into \"majestic persuades\", \"temperate pleases\", and \"subdued teaches\". Writers were encouraged to write in a way that kept in mind the speaker, subject, audience, purpose, manner, and occasion. Chaucer moves freely between all of these styles, showing favouritism to none. He not only considers the readers of his work as an audience, but the other pilgrims within the story as well, creating a multi-layered rhetorical puzzle of ambiguities. Thus Chaucer's work far surpasses the ability of any single medieval theory to uncover.\n\nWith this, Chaucer avoids targeting any specific audience or social class of readers, focusing instead on the characters of the story and writing their tales with a skill proportional to their social status and learning. However, even the lowest characters, such as the Miller, show surprising rhetorical ability, although their subject matter is more lowbrow. Vocabulary also plays an important part, as those of the higher classes refer to a woman as a \"lady\", while the lower classes use the word \"wenche\", with no exceptions. At times the same word will mean entirely different things between classes. The word \"pitee\", for example, is a noble concept to the upper classes, while in the \"Merchant's Tale\" it refers to sexual intercourse. Again, however, tales such as the \"Nun's Priest's Tale\" show surprising skill with words among the lower classes of the group, while the \"Knight's Tale\" is at times extremely simple.\n\nChaucer uses the same meter throughout almost all of his tales, with the exception of \"Sir Thopas\" and his prose tales. It is a decasyllable line, probably borrowed from French and Italian forms, with riding rhyme and, occasionally, a caesura in the middle of a line. His meter would later develop into the heroic meter of the 15th and 16th centuries and is an ancestor of iambic pentameter. He avoids allowing couplets to become too prominent in the poem, and four of the tales (the Man of Law's, Clerk's, Prioress', and Second Nun's) use rhyme royal.\n\n\"The Canterbury Tales\" was written during a turbulent time in English history. The Catholic Church was in the midst of the Western Schism and, although it was still the only Christian authority in Europe, it was the subject of heavy controversy. Lollardy, an early English religious movement led by John Wycliffe, is mentioned in the \"Tales\", which also mention a specific incident involving pardoners (sellers of indulgences, which were believed to relieve the temporal punishment due for sins that were already forgiven in the Sacrament of Confession) who nefariously claimed to be collecting for St. Mary Rouncesval hospital in England. \"The Canterbury Tales\" is among the first English literary works to mention paper, a relatively new invention that allowed dissemination of the written word never before seen in England. Political clashes, such as the 1381 Peasants' Revolt and clashes ending in the deposing of King Richard II, further reveal the complex turmoil surrounding Chaucer in the time of the \"Tales\"' writing. Many of his close friends were executed and he himself moved to Kent to get away from events in London.\n\nWhile some readers look to interpret the characters of \"The Canterbury Tales\" as historical figures, other readers choose to interpret its significance in less literal terms. After analysis of Chaucer's diction and historical context, his work appears to develop a critique of society during his lifetime. Within a number of his descriptions, his comments can appear complimentary in nature, but through clever language, the statements are ultimately critical of the pilgrim's actions. It is unclear whether Chaucer would intend for the reader to link his characters with actual persons. Instead, it appears that Chaucer creates fictional characters to be general representations of people in such fields of work. With an understanding of medieval society, one can detect subtle satire at work.\n\nThe \"Tales\" reflect diverse views of the Church in Chaucer's England. After the Black Death, many Europeans began to question the authority of the established Church. Some turned to lollardy, while others chose less extreme paths, starting new monastic orders or smaller movements exposing church corruption in the behaviour of the clergy, false church relics or abuse of indulgences. Several characters in the \"Tales\" are religious figures, and the very setting of the pilgrimage to Canterbury is religious (although the prologue comments ironically on its merely seasonal attractions), making religion a significant theme of the work.\n\nTwo characters, the Pardoner and the Summoner, whose roles apply the Church's secular power, are both portrayed as deeply corrupt, greedy, and abusive. Pardoners in Chaucer's day were those people from whom one bought Church \"indulgences\" for forgiveness of sins, who were guilty of abusing their office for their own gain. Chaucer's Pardoner openly admits the corruption of his practice while hawking his wares. Summoners were Church officers who brought sinners to the Church court for possible excommunication and other penalties. Corrupt summoners would write false citations and frighten people into bribing them to protect their interests. Chaucer's Summoner is portrayed as guilty of the very kinds of sins for which he is threatening to bring others to court, and is hinted as having a corrupt relationship with the Pardoner. In The Friar's Tale, one of the characters is a summoner who is shown to be working on the side of the devil, not God.\n\nChurchmen of various kinds are represented by the Monk, the Prioress, the Nun's Priest, and the Second Nun. Monastic orders, which originated from a desire to follow an ascetic lifestyle separated from the world, had by Chaucer's time become increasingly entangled in worldly matters. Monasteries frequently controlled huge tracts of land on which they made significant sums of money, while peasants worked in their employ. The Second Nun is an example of what a Nun was expected to be: her tale is about a woman whose chaste example brings people into the church. The Monk and the Prioress, on the other hand, while not as corrupt as the Summoner or Pardoner, fall far short of the ideal for their orders. Both are expensively dressed, show signs of lives of luxury and flirtatiousness and show a lack of spiritual depth. The Prioress's Tale is an account of Jews murdering a deeply pious and innocent Christian boy, a blood libel against Jews that became a part of English literary tradition. The story did not originate in the works of Chaucer and was well known in the 14th century.\n\nPilgrimage was a very prominent feature of medieval society. The ultimate pilgrimage destination was Jerusalem, but within England Canterbury was a popular destination. Pilgrims would journey to cathedrals that preserved relics of saints, believing that such relics held miraculous powers. Saint Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, had been murdered in Canterbury Cathedral by knights of Henry II during a disagreement between Church and Crown. Miracle stories connected to his remains sprang up soon after his death, and the cathedral became a popular pilgrimage destination. The pilgrimage in the work ties all of the stories together and may be considered a representation of Christians' striving for heaven, despite weaknesses, disagreement, and diversity of opinion.\n\nThe upper class or nobility, represented chiefly by the Knight and his Squire, was in Chaucer's time steeped in a culture of chivalry and courtliness. Nobles were expected to be powerful warriors who could be ruthless on the battlefield yet mannerly in the King's Court and Christian in their actions. Knights were expected to form a strong social bond with the men who fought alongside them, but an even stronger bond with a woman whom they idealised to strengthen their fighting ability. Though the aim of chivalry was to noble action, its conflicting values often degenerated into violence. Church leaders frequently tried to place restrictions on jousts and tournaments, which at times ended in the death of the loser. The Knight's Tale shows how the brotherly love of two fellow knights turns into a deadly feud at the sight of a woman whom both idealise. To win her, both are willing to fight to the death. Chivalry was on the decline in Chaucer's day, and it is possible that The Knight's Tale was intended to show its flaws, although this is disputed. Chaucer himself had fought in the Hundred Years' War under Edward III, who heavily emphasised chivalry during his reign. Two tales, \"Sir Topas\" and \"The Tale of Melibee\" are told by Chaucer himself, who is travelling with the pilgrims in his own story. Both tales seem to focus on the ill-effects of chivalry—the first making fun of chivalric rules and the second warning against violence.\n\nThe \"Tales\" constantly reflect the conflict between classes. For example, the division of the three estates: the characters are all divided into three distinct classes, the classes being \"those who pray\" (the clergy), \"those who fight\" (the nobility), and \"those who work\" (the commoners and peasantry). Most of the tales are interlinked by common themes, and some \"quit\" (reply to or retaliate against) other tales. Convention is followed when the Knight begins the game with a tale, as he represents the highest social class in the group. But when he is followed by the Miller, who represents a lower class, it sets the stage for the \"Tales\" to reflect both a respect for and a disregard for upper class rules. Helen Cooper, as well as Mikhail Bakhtin and Derek Brewer, call this opposition \"the ordered and the grotesque, Lent and Carnival, officially approved culture and its riotous, and high-spirited underside.\" Several works of the time contained the same opposition.\n\nChaucer's characters each express different—sometimes vastly different—views of reality, creating an atmosphere of testing, empathy, and relativism. As Helen Cooper says, \"Different genres give different readings of the world: the fabliau scarcely notices the operations of God, the saint's life focuses on those at the expense of physical reality, tracts and sermons insist on prudential or orthodox morality, romances privilege human emotion.\" The sheer number of varying persons and stories renders the \"Tales\" as a set unable to arrive at any definite truth or reality.\n\nThe concept of liminality figures prominently within \"The Canterbury Tales\". A liminal space, which can be both geographical as well as metaphorical or spiritual, is the transitional or transformational space between a “real” (secure, known, limited) world and an unknown or imaginary space of both risk and possibility. The notion of a pilgrimage is itself a liminal experience, because it centres on travel between destinations and because pilgrims undertake it hoping to become more holy in the process. Thus, the structure of \"The Canterbury Tales\" itself is liminal; it not only covers the distance between London and Canterbury, but the majority of the tales refer to places entirely outside the geography of the pilgrimage. Jean Jost summarises the function of liminality in \"The Canterbury Tales\",\n\n\"Both appropriately and ironically in this raucous and subversive liminal space, a ragtag assembly gather together and tell their equally unconventional tales. In this unruly place, the rules of tale telling are established, themselves to be both disordered and broken; here the tales of game and earnest, solas and sentence, will be set and interrupted. Here the sacred and profane adventure begins, but does not end. Here, the condition of peril is as prominent as that of protection. The act of pilgrimaging itself consists of moving from one urban space, through liminal rural space, to the next urban space with an ever fluctuating series of events and narratives punctuating those spaces. The goal of pilgrimage may well be a religious or spiritual space at its conclusion, and reflect a psychological progression of the spirit, in yet another kind of emotional space.\"\n\nLiminality is also evident in the individual tales. An obvious instance of this is the Friar’s Tale in which the yeoman devil is a liminal figure because of his transitory nature and function; it is his purpose to issue souls from their current existence to hell, an entirely different one. The Franklin’s Tale is a Breton Lai tale, which takes the tale into a liminal space by invoking not only the interaction of the supernatural and the mortal, but also the relation between the present and the imagined past.\n\nIt is sometimes argued that the greatest contribution that this work made to English literature was in popularising the literary use of the vernacular English, rather than French or Latin. English had, however, been used as a literary language for centuries before Chaucer's life, and several of Chaucer's contemporaries—John Gower, William Langland, and the Pearl Poet—also wrote major literary works in English. It is unclear to what extent Chaucer was responsible for starting a trend rather than simply being part of it. Although Chaucer had a powerful influence in poetic and artistic terms, which can be seen in the great number of forgeries and mistaken attributions (such as \"The Floure and the Leafe\", which was translated by John Dryden), modern English spelling and orthography owe much more to the innovations made by the Court of Chancery in the decades during and after his lifetime.\n\nWhile Chaucer clearly states the addressees of many of his poems (the \"Book of the Duchess\" is believed to have been written for John of Gaunt on the occasion of his wife's death in 1368), the intended audience of \"The Canterbury Tales\" is more difficult to determine. Chaucer was a courtier, leading some to believe that he was mainly a court poet who wrote exclusively for the nobility. He is referred to as a noble translator and poet by Eustache Deschamps and by his contemporary John Gower. It has been suggested that the poem was intended to be read aloud, which is probable as this was a common activity at the time. However, it also seems to have been intended for private reading as well, since Chaucer frequently refers to himself as the writer, rather than the speaker, of the work. Determining the intended audience directly from the text is even more difficult, since the audience is part of the story. This makes it difficult to tell when Chaucer is writing to the fictional pilgrim audience or the actual reader.\n\nChaucer's works may have been distributed in some form during his lifetime in part or in whole. Scholars speculate that manuscripts were circulated among his friends, but likely remained unknown to most people until after his death. However, the speed with which copyists strove to write complete versions of his tale in manuscript form shows that Chaucer was a famous and respected poet in his own day. The Hengwrt and Ellesmere manuscripts are examples of the care taken to distribute the work. More manuscript copies of the poem exist than for any other poem of its day except \"The Prick of Conscience\", causing some scholars to give it the medieval equivalent of bestseller status. Even the most elegant of the illustrated manuscripts, however, is not nearly as highly decorated as the work of authors of more respectable works such as John Lydgate's religious and historical literature.\n\nJohn Lydgate and Thomas Occleve were among the first critics of Chaucer's \"Tales\", praising the poet as the greatest English poet of all time and the first to show what the language was truly capable of poetically. This sentiment was universally agreed upon by later critics into the mid-15th century. Glosses included in \"The Canterbury Tales\" manuscripts of the time praised him highly for his skill with \"sentence\" and rhetoric, the two pillars by which medieval critics judged poetry. The most respected of the tales was at this time the Knight's, as it was full of both.\n\nThe incompleteness of the \"Tales\" led several medieval authors to write additions and supplements to the tales to make them more complete. Some of the oldest existing manuscripts of the tales include new or modified tales, showing that even early on, such additions were being created. These emendations included various expansions of the \"Cook's Tale\", which Chaucer never finished, \"The Plowman's Tale\", \"The Tale of Gamelyn\", the \"Siege of Thebes\", and the \"Tale of Beryn\".\n\nThe \"Tale of Beryn\", written by an anonymous author in the 15th century, is preceded by a lengthy prologue in which the pilgrims arrive at Canterbury and their activities there are described. While the rest of the pilgrims disperse throughout the town, the Pardoner seeks the affections of Kate the barmaid, but faces problems dealing with the man in her life and the innkeeper Harry Bailey. As the pilgrims turn back home, the Merchant restarts the storytelling with \"Tale of Beryn\". In this tale, a young man named Beryn travels from Rome to Egypt to seek his fortune only to be cheated by other businessmen there. He is then aided by a local man in getting his revenge. The tale comes from the French tale \"Bérinus\" and exists in a single early manuscript of the tales, although it was printed along with the tales in a 1721 edition by John Urry.\n\nJohn Lydgate wrote \"The Siege of Thebes\" in about 1420. Like the \"Tale of Beryn\", it is preceded by a prologue in which the pilgrims arrive in Canterbury. Lydgate places himself among the pilgrims as one of them and describes how he was a part of Chaucer's trip and heard the stories. He characterises himself as a monk and tells a long story about the history of Thebes before the events of the \"Knight's Tale\". John Lydgate's tale was popular early on and exists in old manuscripts both on its own and as part of the \"Tales\". It was first printed as early as 1561 by John Stow, and several editions for centuries after followed suit.\n\nThere are actually two versions of \"The Plowman's Tale\", both of which are influenced by the story \"Piers Plowman\", a work written during Chaucer's lifetime. Chaucer describes a Plowman in the \"General Prologue\" of his tales, but never gives him his own tale. One tale, written by Thomas Occleve, describes the miracle of the Virgin and the Sleeveless Garment. Another tale features a pelican and a griffin debating church corruption, with the pelican taking a position of protest akin to John Wycliffe's ideas.\n\n\"The Tale of Gamelyn\" was included in an early manuscript version of the tales, Harley 7334, which is notorious for being one of the lower-quality early manuscripts in terms of editor error and alteration. It is now widely rejected by scholars as an authentic Chaucerian tale, although some scholars think he may have intended to rewrite the story as a tale for the Yeoman. Dates for its authorship vary from 1340 to 1370.\n\nMany literary works (both fiction and non-fiction alike) have used a similar frame narrative to \"The Canterbury Tales\" as an homage. Science-fiction writer Dan Simmons wrote his Hugo Award winning novel \"Hyperion\" based on an extra-planetary group of pilgrims. Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins used \"The Canterbury Tales\" as a structure for his 2004 non-fiction book about evolution titled \"\". His animal pilgrims are on their way to find the common ancestor, each telling a tale about evolution.\n\nHenry Dudeney's book \"The Canterbury Puzzles\" contains a part reputedly lost from what modern readers know as Chaucer's tales.\n\nHistorical-mystery novelist P.C. Doherty wrote a series of novels based on \"The Canterbury Tales\", making use of both the story frame and Chaucer's characters.\n\nCanadian author Angie Abdou translates \"The Canterbury Tales\" to a cross section of people, all snow-sports enthusiasts but from different social backgrounds, converging on a remote back-country ski cabin in British Columbia in the 2011 novel \"The Canterbury Trail\".\n\n\"The Two Noble Kinsmen\", by William Shakespeare and John Fletcher, a retelling of \"The Knight's Tale\", was first performed in 1613 or 1614 and published in 1634. In 1961, Erik Chisholm completed his opera, \"The Canterbury Tales\". The opera is in three acts: The Wyf of Bath’s Tale, The Pardoner’s Tale and The Nun’s Priest’s Tale. Nevill Coghill's modern English version formed the basis of a musical version that was first staged in 1964.\n\n\"A Canterbury Tale\", a 1944 film jointly written and directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, is loosely based on the narrative frame of Chaucer's tales. The movie opens with a group of medieval pilgrims journeying through the Kentish countryside as a narrator speaks the opening lines of the \"General Prologue\". The scene then makes a now-famous transition to the time of World War II. From that point on, the film follows a group of strangers, each with his or her own story and in need of some kind of redemption, who are making their way to Canterbury together. The film's main story takes place in an imaginary town in Kent and ends with the main characters arriving at Canterbury Cathedral, bells pealing and Chaucer's words again resounding. \"A Canterbury Tale\" is recognised as one of the Powell-Pressburger team's most poetic and artful films. It was produced as wartime propaganda, using Chaucer's poetry, referring to the famous pilgrimage, and offering photography of Kent to remind the public of what made Britain worth fighting for. In one scene a local historian lectures an audience of British soldiers about the pilgrims of Chaucer's time and the vibrant history of England.\n\nPier Paolo Pasolini's 1972 film \"The Canterbury Tales\" features several of the tales, some of which keep close to the original tale and some of which are embellished. The \"Cook's Tale\", for instance, which is incomplete in the original version, is expanded into a full story, and the \"Friar's Tale\" extends the scene in which the Summoner is dragged down to hell. The film includes these two tales as well as the \"Miller's Tale\", the \"Summoner's Tale\", the \"Wife of Bath's Tale\", and the \"Merchant's Tale\".\n\nOn 26 April 1986, American radio personality Garrison Keillor opened \"The News from Lake Wobegon\" portion of the first live TV broadcast of his \"A Prairie Home Companion\" radio show with a reading of the original Middle English text of the General Prologue. He commented, \"Although those words were written more than 600 years ago, they still describe spring.\"\n\nTelevision adaptations include Alan Plater's 1975 re-telling of the stories in a series of plays for BBC2: \"Trinity Tales\". In 2003, BBC again featured modern re-tellings of selected tales.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7130694", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7130694", "title": "The Fallible Fiend", "text": "The Fallible Fiend\n\nThe Fallible Fiend is a fantasy novel by American writer L. Sprague de Camp, the third book of his Novarian series. It was first published as a two-part serial in the magazine \"Fantastic\" for December 1972 and February 1973, and subsequently expanded and revised for book publication. The novel was first published in book form as a paperback by Signet Books in 1973; it was later reprinted by Remploy (1974), Sphere (1978), Del Rey/Ballantine (1981), Baen (1992) and the Thorndike Press (2002). The Remploy edition was both the first British and first hardcover edition. An e-book edition was published by Gollancz's SF Gateway imprint on September 29, 2011 as part of a general release of de Camp's works in electronic form. It has also been translated into German and Italian.\n\nOn the demonic Twelfth Plane the demon Zdim is drafted for a year's indentured servitude on the human Prime Plane, the demon society having an agreement to provide service to human sorcerers in return for supplies of iron, a raw material it desperately needs.\n\nZdim is duly summoned to the Prime Plane by the sorcerer Dr. Maldivius of Novaria. There he strives to do his duty, but his demonic literal-mindedness hampers him. Assigned to protect the Sibylline Sapphire from any trespassers, he promptly eats Maldivius' apprentice Grax when the latter intrudes.\n\nSimilar misadventures result in the disgusted Maldivius selling his contract, and the demon is passed from one master to another, from circus master Bagardo to the rich widow Roska of Ir, all the while doing his level best to figure out what the muddled humans truly wish of him.\n\nAgainst all odds he becomes a hero when he recruits aid for the city-state of Ir after it discounts intelligence of an imminent invasion by the cannibal Paaluans. Returning to his home plane early and with extra iron, he resolves never again to leave the comforts of the Twelfth Plane — until he realizes how dull it is compared with the picturesque insanity of the human realm...\n\nBy internal chronology, \"The Fallible Fiend\" is the second story in the Novarian series, coming after the short story \"The Emperor's Fan\", which is set centuries before the others, and prior to the \"Reluctant King\" trilogy. (The Paaluan invasion of Ir is mentioned in the second and third books of the trilogy, \"The Clocks of Iraz\" and \"The Unbeheaded King\", respectively, as an event occurring either recently or some generations past.)\n\nThe world of which Novaria is part is a parallel world to Earth, a plane of existence related to ours in that ours constitutes its afterlife. Culturally it bears resemblances to the eras of both Classical Greece and Medieval Europe. The states of Novaria itself are split between competing systems of government, some of them unique, which allows the author to explore various pros and cons of different styles of governance as his hero tours the country.\n\nThe name of Ir, the subterranean city-state where much the plot takes place, is simply the Hebrew word for \"city\" (עיר).\n\nAdopting the viewpoint of an outsider to comment on the foibles of one's own society has been done before in fiction,but adapting it to fantasy also permits him to extend it into an outside view of humanity as a whole by an alien being and maintain a satirical edge throughout the book. De Camp's demonic protagonist Zdim long remained a uniquely unlikely fantasy hero, as other authors were slow to mine the concept de Camp pioneered.\n\nRoger C. Schlobin praises the book's \"[d]elightful episodes occur[ring] as the fiend misunderstands his commands and tries to function in a totally alien environment, which is, of course, quite normal for the reader.\" He feels it \"[d]eteriorates somewhat at the end as the fiend becomes a hero and saves civilization.\n\nBrian M. Stableford calls \"\"The Fallible Fiend\" ... more offbeat than de Camp's other ventures in the genre,\" and Zdim \"perhaps the only sword-and-sorcery hero who regularly devours people. Still, he remains likable as he provides a suitably ironic commentary on human affairs from the demonic standpoint.\"\n\nSteven Silver called the book \"a humorous novel, although not in a laugh-out-loud way.\" He sees its \"main point [as] satire, a fact which is driven home if the reader begins to look at characterization or plot, neither of which appear in particular abundance. ... The characters are drawn with broad strokes, each inspired by one, or possibly two, character traits.\" But \"as [with] most satire, he causes the reader[s] to recognize the humor of the situation and compare it to their own situation.\" Silver sees \"Zdim's travels throughout Novaria as a pretext for unleashing slings and arrows of outrageous satire at governmental practices and systems ... thereby highlighting the follies of our own system of government.\" The hero's contact with other cultures, the \"fantasy staples\" of \"the semi-human Zaperazh, the horse nomadic Hruntings, and the cannibalistic Paaluans ... clearly shows why each is as implausible as the more 'corrupt' human institutions of civilizations.\"\n\nDon D'Ammassa finds \"\"The Fallible Fiend\" ... in much the same vein\" as \"The Reluctant King\" series, with \"[m]ost of the humor com[ing] from the efforts by the demon to understand human behavior.\"\n\nMike Ashley called the story \"a wonderfully nostalgic fantasy in the \"Unknown\" tradition.\"\n\nIn its original serial form the book won the British Fantasy Society's 1973 August Derleth Fantasy Award for best short story.\n"}

It is written and designed to emulate a volume of the Tintin books, but is the author's own story. It was written by a Belgian author, Baudouin de Duve, who used the alias Bud E. Weyser, a name that is a play on the name of American beer, Budweiser.\n\n\"Tintin in Thailand\" emulates the style and format of the original Tintin books, with some key differences. With the exception of the cover, the entire volume is in black and white. The characters are imitations of the originals, and are presented as acting uncharacteristically, such as by using profane language. \"Bud E. Weyser\" is listed as the author, and there is a one-page foreword in French.\n\nCopies were printed in Thailand to be distributed in Belgium, where \"Tintin in Thailand\" is thought to have been in circulation from December 1999. Thousands of copies in both French and English were also distributed in Thailand. The quality of the Thai forgeries was found to be superior to that of the Belgian version.\n\nThe plot opens on a rainy and cold night in Marlinspike Hall. The occupants, Tintin and Captain Haddock are unhappy and financially broke, since there are no new Tintin adventures for them because of the death of their creator, Hergé. (This is the first of many self-references the plot makes.) As they discuss their plight, Jolyon Wagg's wife arrives and ask them to go to Thailand to search for her husband, who went there on a trip he won from his employer, the Rock Bottom Insurance Company, and never returned. She had already sent Thomson and Thompson to look, but without any results. Since it is an all expenses paid trip, Tintin and Haddock immediately accept and are soon on their way to Thailand. Nestor, Snowy and the cat are left behind, but Professor Calculus joins them.\n\nAs they check into their Bangkok hotel, they are spotted by Derek Dimwit, a representative of the Marlinsprick Company which holds the rights to the Tintin franchise. He calls his head office and is told he must stop them from going on any more adventures that could be used in a book not controlled by Marlinsprick.\n\nTintin and his friends go to the red light district, where they run into General Alcazar, now the owner of a Thailand bar after being deposed by General Tapioca. Alcazar tells them he saw Jolyon Wagg in his bar, but he has gone north to Chiang Mai with a kathoey (transsexual). Calculus and Haddock both pick up prostitutes in the bar, but Tintin prefers the company of a young boy instead (This is a reference to questions by fans regarding Tintin's sexuality in the original books).\n\nThe next day the adventurers fly north and soon run into Thomson and Thompson. The Thompson twins do not want anyone to find Wagg, since they are enjoying themselves in Thailand at Mrs. Wagg's expense. However, they pick up the trail and Wagg, who is living outside Chiang Mai. They learn he no longer enjoys the company of his kathoey partner. Wagg longs for his wife's cooking, in particular her rabbit marinated in beer. After a series of misadventures, they all find themselves back in Chiang Mai in time to celebrate the new year of 2000. The story ends with Tintin being presented the first copy of \"Tintin in Thailand\". He declares the proceeds will guarantee him many peaceful days in the sun.\n\nIn February 2001, the Hergé Foundation learned about Bud E. Weyser's attempts to market \"Tintin in Thailand\" as an unknown Tintin book to distributors in Belgium. The Belgian police organized a sting, with an officer pretending to be a prospective buyer; two arrests were made in Tournai. They also arrested the designer in Antwerp. The men confessed to printing more than 1,000 copies for sale in Belgium, and the 650 copies found were seized. All three men were subsequently released.\n\nCopies of \"Tintin in Thailand\" can still occasionally be found in Bangkok. However, the Hergé Foundation takes quick action to remove copies that are posted online.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8802370", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8802370", "title": "Unrequited (The X-Files)", "text": "Unrequited (The X-Files)\n\n\"Unrequited\" is the sixteenth episode of the fourth season of the American science fiction television series \"The X-Files\". It was written by Howard Gordon and series creator Chris Carter, and directed by Michael Lange. It originally aired in the United States on February 23, 1997 on the Fox network. The episode is a \"Monster-of-the-Week\" story, a stand-alone plot which is unconnected to the series' wider mythology. This episode earned a Nielsen rating of 10.9 and was seen by 16.56 million viewers upon its initial broadcast. \"Unrequited\" received mixed to negative reviews from television critics.\n\nThe show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, the murder of a U.S. Army Lieutenant General has Mulder and Scully struggling to stop a seemingly invisible assassin. The two agents soon learn that they are doomed to failure from the start, as the U.S. government is attempting to cover up the existence of American POWs still being kept in Vietnam.\n\nGordon was inspired to write the episode after viewing an installment of the news series \"60 Minutes\" that dealt with American secret agents the CIA left behind during the Vietnam War. The eventual concept that the assassin could create blind spots came after the writer spoke with his ophthalmologist brother. The entry featured a finished replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and various Canadian locales substituted for various locations in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe episode begins at the National Mall, where Major General Benjamin Bloch (Scott Hylands) gives a speech to a crowd of Vietnam War veterans. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) patrol the crowd, searching for a potential gunman. However, when the agents see the gunman, he repeatedly disappears and makes their efforts to track him difficult. Mulder finds himself aiming his gun towards the panicked crowd, desperately searching for the gunman, who has disappeared right in front of him.\n\nTwelve hours earlier, at Fort Evanston, Maryland, Lieutenant General Peter MacDougal (Bill Agnew) is shot in his limousine by the gunman. Skinner briefs the agents on the killing, noting a king of hearts playing card—used by the soldiers in Vietnam to mark their kills—was left at the scene. The FBI suspects a far-right paramilitary group, the Right Hand, of killing MacDougal in an effort to stop an upcoming re-dedication of a Vietnam war memorial in Washington.\n\nMulder and Scully head to Virginia to question the Right Hand's leader, Denny Markham (Larry Musser). A search of his fenced-off cabin uncovers ammunition and a photograph showing him in the company of a Sergeant Nathaniel Teager (Peter LaCroix). After being arrested, Markham reveals that Teager was a soldier in Vietnam who was left for dead as a prisoner of war. Meanwhile, at the Vietnam memorial, Teager approaches a war widow and claims that her husband is still alive as a POW. After giving the woman her husband's dog tags, Teager mysteriously disappears.\n\nSkinner informs the agents that Teager is officially dead, and that his remains are at the Army's forensics lab. However, Mulder learns that the lab only possesses Teager's dental remains, and that the cause of his death was recorded as \"inconclusive\". Mulder believes that General John Steffan (William Nunn), who signed Teager's death certificate, is his next target. Teager makes his way past Pentagon security and kills Steffan in his office. Upon seeing Teager on the Pentagon's surveillance tapes, Mulder notes the frequent unexplained appearances and disappearances of Viet Cong troops reported by POWs in Vietnam.\n\nDuring a meeting with Marita Covarrubias (Laurie Holden), Mulder learns that Steffan, McDougal, and Bloch were all involved in negotiations concerning POWs. Meanwhile, as Bloch's motorcade makes its way to the Mall, Scully spots Teager in the crowd, only to see him vanish in an instant. Mulder tells Skinner and Scully that the government has arranged for their investigation to fail in an effort to cover up the truth about American POWs still being kept in Vietnam.\n\nIn the present, during the re-dedication ceremony, Mulder realizes that no one can see Teager if they are in his line of sight. Teager follows Skinner and Bloch to the motorcade, where he unsuccessfully shoots at the general and Skinner suffers a flesh wound. Teager is shot in turn by the agents as he tries to escape. As he succumbs to his wounds, Teager repeats his Army identification. Afterwards, the Pentagon states that the assassin was a different person—which Mulder denounces as a lie. He leaves Skinner to silently ponder his own service in the war as he looks upon Teager's name on the memorial wall.\n\nDuring the show's fourth season, episode co-writer Howard Gordon was slated to pen only one episode, the nineteenth entry \"Synchrony\". However, after hearing rumors about American CIA agents left behind during the Vietnam War, he started to develop what would become the story for \"Unrequited\". The day before the show's 1996 Christmas break, Howard approached series creator Chris Carter and co-executive producer Frank Spotnitz and told them about his new episode idea. The project was green-lit, but Howard struggled with breaking the story, necessitating Carter heavily assisting him (thus their shared writing credits).\n\nGordon had long been interested in writing an antagonist who could turn invisible, but he struggled with finding a scientific mechanism to explain this plot point. Eventually, Gordon discussed the struggle with his ophthalmologist brother, who told about blind spots in the human eye. Gordon noted, \"These stories come from scientific research ... So I said, what if someone could actually create a field of vision where none actually exists?\" Gordon decided to make the antagonist a Vietnam War veteran because \"they are getting old, and like the Holocaust survivor [in] 'Kaddish', starting to die\". This storyline also allowed Gordon the chance to give Vietnam veteran Walter Skinner a larger rolea chance that Gordon relished.\n\nThe episode featured a replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, of which only a portion was real (the rest being filled in with CGI). Due to legal restrictions, the replica featured fake names, chosen by the sister of art assistant Kristina Lyne; the wall also included the names of \"The X-Files\" cast and crew, as well as noted writer Harlan Ellison, and model Jessica Hahn. For day scenes, the replica and an accompanying grandstand were erected in Vancouver's Jericho Park due to the locale's \"expansive, groomed, flat\" characteristics, whereas nigh scenes were filmed in a large warehouse in Ballantyne Pier. This move required the production crew to dismantle and cart the grandstand from Jericho Park to the warehouse. The crowd used to film the memorial's reinauguration scene comprised 500 extras, who were multiplied in post-production with CGI technology. Fifty of these individuals had won the opportunity to appear on the show in local radio contests.\n\nStanley Park doubled as Freedom Plaza. Because the park is public and operated by the Vancouver Park Board, city police cannot deny anyone access. This caused something of an issue when members of the paparazzi tried to photograph Anderson. Consequently, many of the available crew and production staff members formed a \"human blockade\", thereby blocking the photographers and protecting their co-star.\n\n\"Unrequited\" premiered on the Fox network on February 23, 1997. This episode earned a Nielsen rating of 10.9, with a 16 share, meaning that roughly 10.9 percent of all television-equipped households, and 16 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. \"Unrequited\" was seen by 16.56 million viewers on first broadcast. The episode first aired in the United Kingdom on January 7, 1998 on BBC One.\n\nTodd VanDerWerff of \"The A.V. Club\" gave the episode a \"B–\". He wrote that \"Unrequited\" \"isn't a very good episode\" of the series, but that it is \"a potent one all the same\" due to its \"great ideas\" that are unfortunately never expanded upon. VanDerWerff felt that the episode's biggest problem was that it started \"in media res\" and revealed the episode's conclusion, writing \"it's a pretty great starting point for an episode. Instead, it's actually the endpoint\". Despite the negativity towards the plot, he wrote that the entry was \"a good episode for Skinner\" in that it gives him a mission and hints at his past without being heavy-handed. Furthermore, VanDerWerff also applauded the way the show used the Vietnam War in a way that felt \"fresh\". Independent reviewer Sarah Stegall awarded the episode a two out of five and derided it as a \"pseudo-political story\". She was negative towards the \"lack of emotional investment\", which she felt was what damaged the episode; she called Teager a cipher who was portrayed as a \"Twitchy Vet\" rather than a \"Tragic Hero\".\n\nRobert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book \"Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen\", rated the episode two stars out of five. They heavily criticized the episode for taking place before the events of \"Kaddish\" and \"Memento Mori\" in an attempt to not deal with Scully's cancer. Furthermore, the two criticized the episode for being \"thin stuff\" and heavily padded; Shearman and Pearson note that the long teaser is replayed in the episode \"to no new dramatic effect\" and that Covarrubias's appearance offers no new information. Paula Vitaris, writing for \"Cinefantastique\", rated \"Unrequited\" one star out of four, writing that it \"collapses under the weight of its message\" and that it \"fails to bring to life any of its guest characters\". Furthermore, she criticized the reusing of the teaser, noting that it \"just comes off as a writer's device\".\n\n\n"}

The idea of a special calendar for women—based on lunar, solar and astrological cycles—originated at Kvindelandet, an international women’s land in Denmark where 50–60 lesbians from different countries lived together in the late 1970s. The first \"We'Moon\" was self-published in France in 1981 under the name of Mother Tongue Ink, as a pocket-sized astrological moon calendar diary, handwritten in five languages.

Such trees are identified as possessing a special religious or spiritual value. Postulants make votive offerings in hopes of having a wish granted, or a prayer answered, from a nature spirit, saint or goddess, depending on the local tradition. \n\nOne form of votive offering is the token offering of a coin. The remains of one such tree can be found near Ardmaddy House in Argyll, Scotland, a hawthorn, which is a species traditionally linked with fertility. The trunk and branches are covered with hundreds of coins which have been driven through the bark and into the wood. The local tradition is that a wish will be granted for each of the coins so treated.\n\nFolklorist Ceri Houlbrook observed actions at a coin tree in Aira Force, Cumbria, noting that a succession of at least twelve families passed by the site and decided to hammer coins into it using a piece of limestone lying around; she commented that this custom appeared to offer \"little variation: it is imitative, formulaic, homogeneous\".\n\nThe practice of tying pieces of cloth to a wish tree is often directly associated with nearby clootie wells, as they are known in Scotland and Ireland, or \"cloutie\" or \"cloughtie\" in Cornwall.\n\nThere are parallels here with wassailing where the Wassail Queen is lifted up into the boughs of the apple tree, where she places toast that has been soaked in Wassail from the Clayen Cup as a gift to the tree spirits to ensure good luck for the coming season's crop and to show them the fruits of what they created the previous year.\n\nIn a related cultural tradition found in many locations, including the United States, supplicant will toss or hurl shoes into trees that are locally designated as wellsprings of good fortune. See Shoe tossing.\n\n\n\nSince the 1990s the wish tree has played a significant part in many of Yoko Ono's exhibitions. Ono's \"Wish Tree\", installed in the Sculpture Garden of the Museum of Modern Art, New York in July 2010, has become very popular, with contributions from all over the world.\nHer \"Wish Tree for Washington, DC\" at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden was installed three years prior.\n\nFashion Designer Mandali Mendrilla designed a runway collection inspired by Wish Trees called Wish Tree Dress that was presented on the catwalk of the Croatian Fashion Week in June 2015. Mandali also designed an interactive art installation called Mandala of Desires (Blue Lotus Wish Tree) made in peace silk and eco friendly textile ink, displayed at the China Art Museum in Shanghai in November 2015. Visitors were invited to place a wish on the sculpture dress, which will be taken to India and offered to a genuine living Wish Tree. \n\n\n"}
