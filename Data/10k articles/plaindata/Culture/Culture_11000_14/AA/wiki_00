Sweden is historically part of the vodka belt, with high consumption of distilled drinks and binge drinking, but during the later half of the 20th century, habits are more harmonized with western Europe, with increasing popularity of wine and weekday drinking. Wine is now also grown and produced in several parts of Sweden and the southernmost region of Skåne is turning into a hub experiencing a strong growth in number of active vineyards.\n\nThe main Swedish specialty is \"brännvin\" (literally \"burn-wine\"), liquor distilled from fermented grain or potatoes. Vodka is the highest grade of brännvin, with brands like Absolut Vodka and Explorer Vodka. Brännvin seasoned with herbs is known as akvavit. This is usually drunk as a snaps, also known as \"nubbe\", a small shot glass to a traditional meal (especially pickled herring or crayfish).\n\nLager beer is the most popular beer, both with meals and in bars. In restaurants and bars it is usually served as a \"stor stark\" (literally \"large strong\"), a glass usually containing 40 - 50 cL of \"starköl\" (see below). Lättöl (generally around 2% abv) is very popular in lunch restaurants as for the vast majority of people it is possible to drink one serving of it and still stay below the legal limits for drink driving.\n\nSweet cider is also common. As of July 1, 2005, new rules established that only fermented juice from apple or pear is allowed to be called 'cider'. Before this change, any fruit-based drink could be called cider, meaning that what would be considered alcopop in other countries could be sold as cider in Sweden.\n\nSince the Middle Ages, beer was the staple drink in Sweden. Mead was a common delicacy. Distilling was introduced in the 15th century. Prohibition against production and/or sale of brännvin—distilled alcohol—has been enforced during some periods.\n\nAs Sweden was industrialized and urbanized during the 19th century, industrially produced brännvin became more available, and alcohol caused increasing health and social problems. The temperance movement rose, and since 1905, government has had a monopoly on sales of liquor. The Swedish prohibition referendum in 1922 resulted in continued sales of alcohol. A rationing system, called \"Brattsystemet\" or \"motbok\", was used until 1955. As Sweden entered the EU in 1995, drinking habits became more continental, and regulations were relaxed. Systembolaget introduced box wine and law allowed private enterprises to produce, import and market alcohol, and sell directly to restaurants—though the retail monopoly remained. Consumption of alcohol increased by 30% from 1995 to 2005.\n\nSweden has a government alcohol monopoly called Systembolaget for sale of all alcoholic drinks stronger than 3.5% by volume. The minimum purchase age at Systembolaget is 20 years, but 18 at licensed restaurants and bars.\n\nBeer is legally divided into three classes. Class I (maximum 2.25%), called \"lättöl\" (\"light beer\"), is sold without restrictions (although shops often set their own age restrictions). Class II (up to 3.5%), called \"folköl\" (\"people's beer\"), is sold in regular stores, but with the minimum purchase age of 18. Class III, \"starköl\" (\"strong beer\", over 3.5%) is sold only in Systembolaget stores.\n\nDrinks are taxed by content of alcohol, more heavily than in most other countries. The tax on vodka (40%) is 200.56 SEK/litre, on Wine (14%) 22.08 SEK/litre and on beer (4.5%) 6.615 SEK/litre (2007). Beer with 2.8% alcohol or less is exempt from tax, except VAT. The VAT is 12% (food tax) for drinks sold in shops having up to 3.5% alcohol, and 25% above that, and at restaurants.\n\nSystembolaget has a strict monopoly status on alcohol sales to consumers in Sweden, except for restaurant and bars, where alcohol can be sold for immediate consumption (bottles must be opened and can't be brought home).\n\nOther companies (producers and importers) can sell directly to restaurant and bars (EU enforced rule).\nProducers of alcohol, such as vineyards, are not allowed to sell bottles of their products to consumers.\n\nThe only exceptions to the monopoly to consumers are export shops at airports, which can sell alcohol to people checked in for a flight outside the EU. Alcohol cannot be sold on boats on Swedish waters, but the shop is opened at the border to international or foreign waters.\n\nThe import quota from other EU countries is unlimited for personal use. Due to the taxes many Swedes supply themselves in Estonia or Germany. Limited rations of duty-free shopping is allowed on the ferries between Sweden and Finland, provided they dock at Åland, which is an autonomous part of Finland, and has a special treaty with the EU. Ordering alcohol for mail order delivery is permitted, but the Swedish state is able to levy taxes on the recipient of such alcohol.\n\nMoonshining does occur, mainly in rural areas. Distilling without a commercial production license is illegal in Sweden, even for personal use, and might result in fines or jail time. The mere act of owning parts of a still is also illegal. \n\nAlcohol can be sold in restaurants, bars and nightclubs. The age limit is 18, though some nightclubs voluntarily require a minimum age at the door above 18 (usually 20 or 23, occasionally up to 27). Alcohol may be served only between 11 AM-1 AM. Municipalities can permit a later closure time, sometimes as late as 5 AM.\n\nAlcohol is only allowed to be sold at bars if they are defined as restaurants, which means they have to offer warm food on location. After 23:00 a simple menu is enough. Restaurants, bars and pubs need permission from the municipality to sell alcohol. Overly drunk people must not be allowed to enter premises with an alcohol license. People who get noticeably intoxicated while at the premises must not be served more and have to be removed immediately.\nThe alcohol must be for immediate consumption, meaning that the staff has to open bottles. Guests are not allowed to bring alcoholic drinks into the restaurant or out from it. This includes if there is an adjacent convenience store, people are not allowed to buy 3.5% beer and drink in the restaurant. If a train or domestic aircraft is licensed to sell alcohol people are not allowed to drink their own alcohol. Outdoor areas in restaurants must be clearly separated from the street.\nRestaurants must claim payment for every single glass and bottle sold. The inclusion of a first drink in the admission fee is prohibited. It is legal to sell large bottles of hard alcohol to groups, but not after 1 a.m.\n\nFrom the 19th century to 1977 restaurants had to serve warm food when alcohol was sold. Many people bought simple food which they did not eat. It could be as simple as a boiled egg. Regulars who were known not to eat the food were often served food which had already been served to other customers.\n\nThe temperance movement is strong in Sweden, especially in agricultural areas, and often connected with the \"free churches\" (non-conformists, that is Protestants outside the Church of Sweden). The Straight Edge movement spread among Swedish youth in the 1990s.\n\nScandinavian Lutherans played a large part in supporting Prohibition in the United States.\n\n"}

The event is organized by Rob Jones and offers a full program of daytime conferences at ADE Pro, ADE Tech, HDE, ADE University, ADE Next, ADE Beamlab and ADE Green, alongside the nighttime ADE Festival which features 450 events and 2,200 artists over five days in 115 clubs and venues. The shows attract over 350,000 people from all over the world to the city, making Amsterdam one of the busiest clubbing cities in the world.\n\nStarted in 1995 as a three-day conference and attended by 300 delegates with thirty DJs performing, the ADE was initially based in De Balie for the daytime conference and at night featured shows in three venues: Paradiso, Melkweg and Club Escape. The event starts off on Wednesday with ADE Pro, ADE Tech. ADE Green and ADE University, plus in the evening the DJ Cook-Off, which was won for a third time by Seth Troxler in 2013. Alongside that, ADE also now includes the awards ceremony of the DJ Mag Top 100 DJs Poll.\n\nThe ADE Pro daytime program, which attracted 5,500 music, media and technology industry professionals in 2014, is based around the Felix Meritis centre and the Dylan Hotel, both located on the Keizersgracht. ADE University, is a program for aspiring music industry professionals, with ADE Green (in association with SFX) taking place at the Chicago Social Club. The festival also includes the Hard Dance Event (HDE) in the Melkweg for harder styles of electronic music. ADE also opens its doors to non-professional musicians with ADE Next, where aspiring artists and producers are invited to meet some of the world’s most popular and in-demand artists, DJs and producers face-to-face in order to get expert opinions on their work. The event's latest initiative is ADE Playground, which started in 2011 as a new technology showcase, but since 2012 features around 30 pop-up events, surprise daytime appearances by top DJs, special product lines, film screenings, and discounts in shops and bars. In 2012 it was also announced that ADE would officially go from a four-day event to five days due to the rapidly growing number of 'afters' events on Sunday.\n\nThe nighttime line-up features over 2200 DJs and artists as well as a selection of upcoming local and international talent, playing to a total of more than 350,000 clubbers in venues all over the city.

{"id": "2506992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2506992", "title": "Babaylan", "text": "Babaylan\n\nBabaylan (also balian or katalonan, among many other names), were animistic shamans of the various ethnic groups of the pre-colonial Philippine islands. These shamans were almost always women or feminized men (\"asog\" or \"bayok\"). They were believed to have spirit guides, by which they could contact and interact with the spirits (\"anito\") and the spirit world. Their primary role were as mediums during \"pag-anito\" séance rituals. There were also various subtypes of \"babaylan\" specializing in the arts of healing and herbalism, divination, and sorcery.\n\n\"Babaylan\" were highly respected members of the community, on par with the pre-colonial noble class. Their influence waned when most of the ethnic groups of the Philippines converted to Catholicism and Islam. Under the Spanish Empire, \"babaylan\" were often maligned as witches and \"priests of the devil\" and were persecuted harshly by the Spanish clergy. In modern Philippine society, their roles have largely been taken over by folk healers, which are now predominantly male.\n\n\"Babaylan\" and related terms are derived from Proto-Western-Malayo-Polynesian \"*balian\", meaning \"shaman\" (probably originally female, transvestite, or hermaphroditic) or \"medium\". Various cognates in other non-Filipino Austronesian languages include \"babalian\", \"bobolian\", and \"bo-bohizan\" (Kadazan-Dusun); \"wadian\" (Ma'anyan); \"belian\", (Iban); \"belian\" (Malay); \"walen\" or \"walyan\" (Old Javanese); \"balian\" (Balinese); \"bolian\" (Mongondaw); \"balia\" (Uma); \"wulia\" or \"balia\" (Bare'e); \"balia\" (Wolio); \"balian\" (Ngaju); and \"balieng\" (Makassar).\n\nThe linguist Otto Dempwolff has theorized that it may ultimately be derived from Proto-Austronesian \"*bali\" (\"escort\", \"accompany\") with the suffix \"*-an\", in the meaning of \"one who escorts a soul to the other world (a psychopomp)\". However the linguists Robert Blust and Stephen Trussel have noted that there is no evidence that \"*balian\" is a suffixed form, and thus believe that Dempwolff's interpretation is incorrect.\n\nThe most common term for shamans in the Philippines are \"baylan\", \"balian\", or cognates and spelling variants thereof. However, different ethnic groups had different names for shamans, including shamans with specialized roles. These are:\n\nMost \"babaylan\" inherited their status from an older \"babaylan\" they were voluntarily apprenticed to, usually a relative. In some cultures, like among the Isneg people, older shamans can choose apprentices from among the eligible young women of the village.\n\nA few, however, become \"babaylan\" after experiencing what has been termed a \"shamanistic initiatory crisis\" (also \"shamanic illness\" or \"shamanic madness\"). This includes serious or chronic illnesses, near-death experiences, sudden seizures and trembling, depression, strange events or behavior (including climbing \"balete\" trees or disappearing for several days with no memory of the events), bouts of insanity (including those induced by psychological trauma from a past event), and strange visions or dreams. These are regarded as encounters with the spirits, where the soul of the person is said to be journeying to the spirit world. In cases like this, it is said that a spirit chose the person, rather than the other way around.\n\nAfter being chosen, shamans go through an initiation rite. These rites are meant to gain or transfer the patronage of a spirit. Among Visayans, this ritual is known as the \"tupad\" or \"tupadan\". In cases of people with \"shamanic illness\", these initiation rites are regarded as the cure, where the initiate regains health or sanity by conceding to the wishes of the spirits and \"answering the call\". When volunteered rather than volunteering, their relatives are usually required to pay a large fee to the senior shaman for the training. Initiation rites can range from simply inducing a trance through herbs or alcohol, to inducing personal crises through physical or psychological hardship. Extreme examples of initiation rites include getting buried alive or being immersed in water overnight.\n\nAfter initiation, the apprentices are then trained in the details of their role. This training includes learning about the rituals, the chants and songs, the sacrifices appropriate for each spirit, oral histories, herbs and healing practices, and magic spells, among others. They usually assist the senior shaman during ceremonies until their training is complete, which can take months to years. Each shaman can have one or more such apprentices, at varying ranks or specializations.\n\nThe shaman's power to communicate with the spirit world is derived from their spirit companions that guide them and intercede for them. These spirits are usually referred to in euphemistic terms like \"abyan\" (\"friend\"), \"alagad\" or \"bantay\" (\"guardian\"), or \"gabay\" (\"guide\"), among other terms. Shamans have at least one \"abyan\", with more powerful shamans having many. Certain individuals like powerful leaders or warriors (especially those with shaman relatives) are also believed to have their own \"abyan\" that give them magical powers. \"Abyan\" are also believed to guide, teach, and inspire skilled artists and craftsmen in the community.\n\n\"Abyan\" spirits can be ancestor spirits, but they are more commonly non-human spirits. Shamans either had spirit companions from birth, drew their attention during the \"shamanic illness\", or gained their allegiance during initiation into shamanism. Spirits are believed to be social beings, with individual quirks and personalities (both good and bad). The friendship of \"abyan\" depend on reciprocity. The shamans do not command them. People with \"abyan\" must regularly offer sacrifices to these spirits, usually consisting of food, alcoholic drinks, \"ngangà\", and blood from a sacrificial animal (usually a chicken or a pig) in order to maintain good relations. This friendship of \"abyan\", once earned, is enduring. They become, in essence, part of the family. The \"abyan\" of a deceased shaman will often \"return\" to a living relative who might choose to become a shaman as well.\n\nThe \"abyan\" are essential in shamanistic rituals as they prevent the shaman's soul from getting lost in the spirit world. They also communicate entreaties on behalf of the shaman to more powerful spirits or deities, as well as fight evil spirits during healing or exorcism rituals.\n\nIn most Philippine ethnic groups, shamans were predominantly female due to the role of the shaman (especially the medium) being an intrinsically feminine one. Among the minority of males, most belonged to a special class of shamans - the feminized men known as \"asog\" in the Visayas and \"bayok\" in Luzon. The \"asog\" assumed the voice, mannerisms, hairstyle, and dress of females. They were treated as women by the community and worked in traditionally feminine professions like shamanism, pottery, and weaving.\n\nIn \"Historia de las islas e indios de Bisayas\" (1668), the Spanish historian and missionary Francisco Ignacio Alcina records that the \"asog\" became shamans by virtue of being themselves. Unlike female shamans, they neither needed to be chosen nor did they undergo initiation rites. However, not all \"asog\" trained to become shamans.\n\nNevertheless, male shamans remained rare. The \"Bolinao Manuscript\" (1685), for example, records that during an Inquisitional investigation of the shamans in the town of Bolinao between 1679 and 1685, animistic paraphernalia were confiscated from 148 people. Of those, 145 were female shamans, and the remaining three were transvestite male shamans.\n\n\"Babaylan\" can freely marry and have children, including male \"asog\" who were recorded by early Spanish colonists as being married to men. In some ethnic groups, marriage was a prerequisite for gaining full shaman status.\n\nAfter the Spanish conquest of the Philippines, the practice of shamanism became clandestine due to persecution by the Catholic clergy. During this period, male shamans (particularly those specialized in the non-religious arts of herbalism and healing) became predominant. Female shamans became less common, while \"asog\" (shaman or otherwise) were punished harshly and driven to hiding. The change in women's status and the ostracization of the \"asog\", however, did not immediately change the originally feminine role of the shamans. Male shamans in the late 17th century still dressed as women during rituals, even though they didn't do so in their day-to-day activities. Unlike the ancient \"asog\", they did not have sexual relations with other men, and indeed, were usually married to women.\n\nThe primary role of shamans were as spirit mediums. They were intermediaries between the physical world and the spirit world, due to their ability to influence and interact with the spirits (\"anito\"), both malevolent and benevolent.\n\nThere are two general types of spirits usually interacted with in séance rituals. The first are the environmental or nature spirits \"bound\" to a particular location or natural phenomenon (similar to genii loci). They \"own\" places and concepts like agricultural fields, forests, cliffs, seas, winds, lightning, or realms in the spirit world. Some were also \"keepers\" or totems of various animals and plants. They have inhuman and abstract qualities, reflecting their particular dominions. They do not normally appear in human form and are usually gender-less or androgynous. They rarely concern themselves with human affairs. Rituals involving these spirits are almost always conducted outdoors.\n\nThe second type of spirits are the \"unbound\" spirits which have independent existence. They appear in animal (usually as birds) or human-like forms, have gender differentiation, and have personal names. They are most similar to the fairies of European folklore. These are the most common types of spirits to become \"abyan\", as they are the most \"sociable\" and can take interest in human activities. These spirits are usually referred to as \"engkanto\" (from Spanish \"encanto\") in modern Filipino folklore. Unlike the \"bound\" spirits, these spirits can be invited into human households, and their rituals can take place both outdoors and indoors.\n\nThese categories are not static, however. A bound spirit can become unbound, and vice versa. Some shamans have spirit guides which are originally nature spirits that have become unbound.\n\nNot all shamanic rituals result in spirit possession. Unbound spirits always possess shamans during rituals. Either voluntarily or involuntarily. In contrast, bound spirits, as a rule, do not possess shamans. Instead, they are simply spoken to by the shaman. Bound spirits that inadvertently \"stick\" to humans are considered dangerous, and are the causes of spiritual illnesses, ranging from confusion, strange food cravings, lust, to unreasoning anger. Sometimes in order to speak to certain bound spirits, the shaman may need the intercession of their \"abyan\", who in turn will possess the shaman. Bound spirits can also be interacted with by non-shamans, like when offering sacrifices to the spirit of the forest before a hunt.\n\nHealing was the most important role for shamans in their communities. Shamans distinguished between two kinds of illnesses, the natural (or non-spiritual) illnesses, and the spiritual illnesses. Natural illnesses do not require a shaman for healing, while spiritual illnesses do.\n\nLike in other Austronesian cultures, animistic Filipinos believed in the concept of soul dualism (sometimes referred to as \"twin souls\" or \"double souls\"). A person is believed to be composed of at least two souls - the breath of life (\"ginhawa\" or \"hininga\", which stays with the living body) and the astral soul (the \"kalag\" or \"kaluluwa\", which can travel to the spirit world). The \"ginhawa\" is believed to reside in the pit of the stomach (usually the liver), while the \"kalag\" resides in the head. The \"ginhawa\" represents the person's body and bodily urges; while the \"kalag\" represents the person's identity, mind, and strength of will. Both are required in a living person.\n\nNatural illnesses are the result of damage to the \"ginhawa\". While they do not require a shaman, they are still important, as the death of the \"ginhawa\" will also mean the death of the body. They can range from wounds, broken bones, poisoning, and snakebites. These can be treated by skilled shamans, but were more often relegated to apprentices or assistants specializing in healing or herbalism. \n\nSpiritual illnesses, on the other hand, are believed to be caused by the separation of the \"kalag\" from the \"ginhawa\" (referred to as \"soul loss\" in anthropological literature). This separation happens normally during sleep, where the \"kalag\" detaches to travel through the spirit world, resulting in dreams. However, when this separation happens when the person is awake, it results in spiritual illnesses. The causes of the separation can include the \"kalag\" getting lost in the spirit world; the \"kalag\" being captured, attacked, or seduced by another spirit; or simply the refusal of the \"kalag\" to return to the \"ginhawa\". While it is not immediately lethal, the loss of the \"kalag\" can result in the loss of the person's mind and identity - thus insanity. Spiritual illnesses also include delirium, depression, trauma, fainting spells, and other mental illnesses. Evil or undesirable behavior may also be blamed on disharmony between the \"kalag\" and the \"ginhawa\".\n\nShamans may also perform rituals to heal and strengthen the \"kalag\" of a person. These include the ritual of \"batak dungan\" or \"batakan\" among Visayan shamans. It strengthens and empowers the \"kalag\" of a person to prepare them for challenges, problems and obstacles. This ritual also protects the person from possible spiritual attack caused by malevolent spirits and sorcery.\n\nAside from rituals and herbal medicine, an ubiquitous traditional healing method done by shamans and healers is massage with oils (\"lana\") known as \"hilot\" or \"haplos\". It is still commonly practiced to this day.\n\nDivination was closely tied to healing, as it was primarily used for diagnosing illnesses. It can be done by the shamans or by specialized apprentices with the necessary skill. Various paraphernalia and rituals are used to diagnose illnesses, examples include seashells, ginger, quartz or alum crystals (\"tawas\"), and chicken entrails. Diviners have names that indicate their preferred methods. For example, a diviner using alum crystals is known as a \"magtatawas\", while a diviner that prefers to conduct a ritual known as \"luop\" is known as a \"mangluluop\".\n\nDiviners are also able to foretell the future and perform geomancy rituals. A key mythological creature used in \"babaylan\" geomancy in the Visayas is the \"bakunawa\" (or \"naga\"), usually depicted as a gigantic serpent or dragon with a looped tail. The movements of the \"bakunawa\" affected the physical world, from the phases of the moon, to eclipses, the weather, floods, and earthquakes. The \"bakunawa\" was central to a sixteen-point compass rose. It faces a different cardinal direction every three months; facing north (\"aminhan\"), west (\"katungdan\"), south (\"bagatnan\"), and east (\"sidlangan\") in a given twelve-month lunar year. The mouth of the \"bakunawa\" is believed to bring misfortune and evil, and various points in the compass all had different aspects depending on where the mouth was facing. These were consulted when making future plans like travel, trade, or marriage. When building houses, shamans were also often consulted to determine the most propitious placement of the foundations to avoid the ill luck brought by the \"bakunawa\".\n\nSome shamans were believed to be able to control the physical world through incantations, talismans, potions, or their spirit intermediaries. Healers are more strongly associated with sorcerers than mediums. In most cases, a healer is also a sorcerer. In order to cure or counteract sorcerous illnesses, healers must themselves know sorcery. This relationship is most apparent in Siquijor Island, where healer-sorcerers are still common.\n\nIn some cultures like the Manobo people, shamans are entirely differentiated from sorcerers. Shamans deal with the spirit world and supernatural beings but do not have magical powers of their own; while sorcerers were regarded as human beings with powers gained from magical spells or objects. Illnesses believed to be caused by sorcery are treated differently from illnesses caused by spirits. The former are treated with counter-spells, simple antidotes, and physical healing; while the latter requires the intervention or dialogue with the spirits and thus a shaman ritual.\n\nIn contrast, in Visayan societies, the most powerful shamans were sorcerers known as \"dalagangan\" (also \"dalongdongan\" or \"busalian\"). They could purportedly command the elements through magic spells and the strength of their \"kalag\" (or \"dungan\"). Their alleged powers include conjuring fire or water, flight, shape-shifting, invisibility, invulnerability, and the ability to call down disasters. The \"dios-dios\" leaders of the Visayan peasant revolts in the late 19th century often claimed to possess these kinds of powers. A more common use of the power to command elements is rainmaking. A notable example was Estrella Bangotbanwa, a Karay-a \"ma-aram\" from southern Iloilo. According to local legend, she alleviated a three-year drought by performing a ritual that summoned a rainstorm.\n\nSorcerers are also believed to have powers that cause harm to other people covertly. Healer-sorcerers who practice this kind of sorcery usually justify it as a form of criminal punishment, as a widespread belief is that black magic does not work on people who are innocent. Their targets are usually \"wrongdoers\" like thieves, adulterous spouses, or land grabbers. There are also \"true\" sorcerers who are said to have hereditary sorcerous powers. Unlike healers, they do not consider the justice of their actions. The latter type of sorcerers are often conflated with the evil supernatural beings capable of appearing human, like \"aswang\" and \"manananggal\".\n\nOne of the most common kinds of black magic is a malevolent use of sympathetic magic. This is known by various names like \"kulam\", \"gaway\" (Tagalog); \"barang\", \"hiwit\", \"lágà\" (Visayan); \"tanem\", \"tamay\" (Ilocano); and \"pantak\" (Moro). Despite the differences in terminology, the methods are almost identical across the Philippine islands (and indeed, across Southeast Asia). This type of sorcery uses beetles, effigies, poppets, a boiling pot or some other type of representation of the target victim. These are usually \"linked\" by including bodily exuviae like hair or nail clippings. These are activated by chants, spells, or symbols (sometimes syncretized with Christian or Muslim rituals). The sorcerer then either harms the effigy to cause corresponding harm to the victim, or physically \"sends\" objects into the victim's body (which can range from insects, stones, to pins). In some instances, the ingredients of the ritual themselves determine the effects. For example, adding seawater to a boiling pot \"linked\" to a victim is said to cause the victim's belly to swell and ache in time with the tides. This type of sorcery was documented as early as the 17th century by Francisco Combés.\n\nOther malevolent powers are more direct. These include the ability to kill another person instantly with magic spells, the ability to cast curses or the evil eye, the ability to \"abduct\" a person's soul, or the ability to send evil spirits or familiar animals to possess or harm the victim.\n\nSome of these purportedly sorcerous powers may be explained by the use of poisons (\"hilo\" or \"lason\") and sleight of hand. In most cases however, accusations of this type of black magic are often borne out of paranoia, moral panic, or mass hysteria against disliked or mistrusted members of the community, similar to the European witch-hunts. People accused of black magic were often subject to ostracization and in many cases, violence. This was especially true during the Spanish colonial period, where in one instance in the mid-19th century, a Filipino curate ordered the assassination of 57 people he suspected were sorcerers casting evil spells on his sick mother.\n\nSorcerous \"attacks\" are most commonly treated with \"sumbalik\" (counter-spells or antidotes), which are themselves, a form of sorcery and do not usually require interaction with the spirits. They purportedly deflect the effects of the curse and return it to the caster. In extreme cases, \"sumbalik\" can kill the caster. Other healing rituals against sorcery do not harm the caster, but instead supposedly moves them to pity and thus revoke the curse.\n\nThe Spanish colonization of the Philippines and the introduction of Catholic Christianity resulted in the extinction of most native shamanistic practices. Christianity was initially seen by native Filipinos as another type of \"anito\". The Spanish missionaries exploited this misconception in their successful conversion and occupation of most of the islands with minimal military support. Spanish friars were seen as \"shamans\" whose souls and spirit guides were apparently more powerful than the native ones. They desecrated religious objects, sacred trees, and sacred areas with impunity, earning the awe of the natives. They could also cure various diseases that the native shamans could not.\n\nBy the late 16th century, Christian symbols and paraphernalia (like rosaries, crucifixes, and holy water) became fetish objects, and Latin prayers and verses became part of the shaman's repertoire of magical chants and spells. \"Anito\" images (\"taotao\") were replaced by Catholic idols and their rituals syncretized, including attributing \"anito\"-like powers to them like miraculous healing from touching them or an ability to possess people. These flourished as they were tolerated by the Spanish clergy as \"white magic\". Nature spirits (\"diwata\") during this period were also syncretized with the friars themselves, they became known as \"engkanto\" and began to be described as having European features with a propensity for deceiving, seducing, and playing tricks on people.\n\nThe previously high status of the \"babaylan\" was lost. The role of women and the relative gender egalitarianism of Philippine animistic cultures in general became more subdued under the patriarchal culture of the Spanish. Most \"babaylan\" were stigmatized by the Catholic clergy as witches, satanists, or mentally unstable. A few however were assimilated by the church and syncretized their roles into mysticism in the Christian context, becoming faith healers and miracle workers. These include the \"beata\" movement in the 17th and 18th century, the messianic (and usually revolutionary) \"dios-dios\" movement of the late 19th century, and the \"espiritista\" (or \"spiritista\") movement of the 20th century. However, their methods of worship remain basically the same. The faith healers are still in essence, mediums; but instead of channeling \"anito\", they instead claim to channel saints, angels, or the Holy Spirit. Late 20th century and 21st century faith healers also frequently use western esoteric and pseudoscientific terminology and practices (like \"psychic energy\" and psychic surgery), with little connection to traditional shamanic religions.\n\nOthers abandoned the animistic aspects of shamanism and became folk healers (\"arbularyo\"), midwives, and practitioners of traditional \"hilot\" massage therapy with oils. These modern versions of \"babaylan\" are now usually male (except midwives). They are usually sought out in minor aliments and in illnesses that modern medicine can not diagnose or cure. Like in ancient \"babaylan\", modern \"babaylan\" distinguish between \"spiritual diseases\" and \"natural diseases\", the latter they will usually refer to a medical doctor.\n\nSimilarly, among Muslim Filipinos, shamans, usually male, are now relegated to folk healing and in dealing with \"indigenous\" spirits. All other aspects of the religious life of Muslim Filipinos have been taken over by Islamic religious leaders. A direct equivalent of the Christian Filipino \"faith healers\" and \"albolaryo\" are Islamized shamans known as \"pandita\" or \"guru\". They follow Islam but also provide traditional healing practices and cultural rituals retained from their shamanistic past. They usually perform minor rites like \"aqiqah\" (cutting the hair of the firstborn) and \"ruqqiya\" (exorcism). A version of the traditional massage therapy conducted by folk healers also exist, known as \"agud\" or \"agod\" among the Maranao and Maguindanao people.\n\nThe most strongly affected by this religious shift to Abrahamic religions were the feminized male \"asog\" shamans. During the 17th to 18th centuries, Spanish administrators in the Philippines burned people convicted of homosexual relations at the stake and confiscated their possessions, in accordance to a decree by the president of the Real Audiencia, Pedro Hurtado Desquibel. Several instances of such punishments were recorded by the Spanish priest Juan Francisco de San Antonio in his \"Chronicas de la Apostolica Provincia de San Gregorio\" (1738–1744).\n\nFeminized men were also persecuted harshly in the (then recently) Islamized ethnic groups in Mindanao. In \"Historia de las Islas de Mindanao, Iolo, y sus adyacentes\" (1667), the Spanish priest Francisco Combés records that their \"unnatural crime\" was punished by the Muslim peoples in Mindanao with death by burning or drowning, and that their houses and property were also burned as they believed that it was contagious.\n\nA few followers of the native shamanism resisted Spanish rule and conversion, especially in areas difficult to reach for Spanish missionaries, like the highlands of Luzon and the interiors of Mindanao. In Spanish-controlled areas (especially in the Visayas), entire villages would defy the policies of \"reducciónes\" (resettlement) and move deeper into the island interiors at the instigation of their \"babaylan\". Shamanistic rituals also continued to be performed secretly in some areas, though these were punished by the Spanish clergy when discovered.\n\nOpen revolts led by shamans were common during Spanish rule. Aside from the early revolts in the 17th century, most of these were led by religious leaders who practiced Folk Catholicism rather than true shamanism.\n\nThe first recorded armed revolt led by a \"babaylan\" was the Tamblot uprising of Bohol in 1621–1622. It was led by a male shaman named Tamblot who saw the spread of Catholicism as a threat. He rallied around two thousand followers in an effort to \"return to the old ways\", but his rebellion was crushed by the Spanish authorities with the help of converted native auxiliaries.\n\nTamblot's revolt inspired another rebellion in neighboring Carigara, Leyte in the same time period. The Bankaw revolt was led by a \"datu\" named Bankaw and his son Pagali who was a \"babaylan\". Bankaw's rebellion was notable as Bankaw was one of the first converts to Catholicism in the Philippines. As a young man, he had formerly welcomed the \"conquistador\" Miguel López de Legazpi in 1565 when their expedition first landed on the islands. Like Tamblot, Bankaw and Pagali both wanted a return to the old ways. Bankaw renounced his Catholic faith and built a temple to a \"diwata\". Their rebellion was defeated by the Spanish Governor-general Alonso Fajardo de Entenza. Bankaw was beheaded, while Pagali and eighty-one other \"babaylan\" were burned at the stake.\n\nThe Tapar rebellion was an uprising in Iloilo, Panay led by a \"babaylan\" named Tapar in 1663. Tapar syncretized native shamanism with Catholic terminology and declared himself \"God Almighty\" of a new religion. He also emulated the ancient \"asog\" by dressing up in women's clothing. He and his followers killed a Spanish priest and burned the town church before escaping to the mountains. Tapar and other leaders of his movement were captured and executed by Spanish and Filipino soldiers.\n\nA religious uprising in 1785 in Ituy (modern Aritao), Nueva Vizcaya was led by a healer named Lagutao. He claimed that an outbreak of smallpox in northern Luzon was a result of the natives abandoning their ancestral beliefs. It was suppressed by neighboring Christian townsmen led by Dominican friars.\n\nThe 19th century saw the rise of the \"dios-dios\" \"shamans\". \"Dios-dios\" (literally \"god pretender\" or \"false god\", from Spanish \"dios\") were religious leaders so named because of their penchant for identifying themselves with Christian religious figures. They led cult-like religious movements, promising prosperity, supernatural powers, or healing to their followers. Most were mere charlatans selling amulets and magical pieces of paper. Their members were mostly from the illiterate rural poor who had little knowledge of formal Catholic teachings and were living in extreme poverty under colonial rule.\n\nThere are numerous examples of \"dios-dios\" leaders in the 19th century. They include Lungao, a healer from Ilocos who claimed he was Jesus Christ in 1811; Ignacio Dimas, who led the \"Tres Cristos\" of Libmanan, Nueva Cáceres (modern Camarines Sur) who claimed they had supernatural powers over diseases in 1865; Benedicta, an old woman and a healer who called herself \"La Santa de Leyte\" in 1862 and prophesied that the island of Leyte would sink; Clara Tarrosa, an eighty-year old \"babaylan\" in Tigbauan, Iloilo in the late 1880s who proclaimed herself the Virgin Mary and isolated herself and her followers from Spanish rule; Francisco Gonzalez (alias \"Francisco Sales\" or \"Fruto Sales\") of Jaro, Leyte who claimed in 1888 that he was a king sent to save people from another great flood by leading them to a city that would rise from the waves; and many more. These movements were usually suppressed by the Spanish by imprisoning their leaders or exiling them.\n\nThe \"dios-dios\" movement was initially purely religious, only reacting defensively to Spanish persecution. However, by the 1880s, some \"dios-dios\" groups became more violently anti-colonial. The first such group was the one led by Ponciano Elofre, a \"cabeza de barangay\" of a \"sitio\" of Zamboanguita, Negros Oriental. He took the name \"Dios Buhawi\" (\"Whirlwind God\") and proclaimed himself the savior of the people. He declared that they would stop paying taxes to the Spanish government. He formed a community of around two thousand followers (whom the Spanish authorities called the \"babaylanes\") and would regularly attack Spanish-controlled towns. Emulating the ancient \"asog\" shamans, he dressed in women's clothing and assumed feminine mannerisms even though he was married to a woman. He claimed supernatural powers much like the ancient \"dalagangan\". He was killed while attacking the town of Siaton in 1887. His wife and relatives attempted to continue the movement, but they were eventually captured and exiled by Spanish authorities. The remnants of the group either descended to banditry or joined other later \"dios-dios\" movements.\n\nAnother \"dios-dios\" uprising was led by a shaman named Gregorio Lampinio (better known as \"Gregorio Dios\", and also known as \"Hilario Pablo\" or \"Papa\") in Antique from 1888. The uprising was formed near Mount Balabago, a sacred pilgrimage site for shamans. Lampinio led a force of around 400 people. They collected \"contribuciones babaylanes\" (a revolutionary tax), disseminated anti-colonial ideas, and launched attacks on towns in Antique and Iloilo. The group was eventually suppressed by the Guardia Civil by 1890.\n\nThe last significant \"dios-dios\" rebellion in the 19th century was led by Dionisio Magbuelas, better known as Papa Isio (\"Pope Isio\"). He was a former member of the Dios Buhawi group. He organized his own \"babaylanes\" group from remnants of Elofre's followers and led an uprising in Negros Occidental in 1896 against Spanish rule. After the Philippines was ceded to the United States after the Spanish–American War, he was initially made \"military chief\" of La Castellana, Negros Occidental under the American government. However, he picked up armed resistance again in 1899 in the Philippine–American War. He surrendered in August 6, 1907 to American authorities and was sentenced to death. This was later commuted to life imprisonment and he died in the Manila Bilibid Prison in 1911.\n\nConcurrent with Papa Isio's rebellion in Negros Occidental against American rule, the \"dios-dios\" movement in eastern Visayas turned their attention to the new American colonial government. Calling themselves the Pulajanes (\"those who wear red\"), they were led by Faustino Ablen (\"Papa Faustino\") in Leyte; and Pablo Bulan (\"Papa Pablo\"), Antonio Anugar, and Pedro de la Cruz in Samar. Like their predecessors, they claimed supernatural powers and used fetishistic amulets, holy oils, and magic spells in battle. They attacked both American troops and local Filipinos cooperating with the American colonial government. The last Pulajanes leader was killed in 1911.\n\n"}
{"id": "359443", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=359443", "title": "Bathos", "text": "Bathos\n\nBathos ( ; ,  \"depth\") is a literary term, coined by Alexander Pope in his 1727 essay \"Peri Bathous\", to describe amusingly failed attempts at sublimity (i.e., pathos). In particular, bathos is associated with anticlimax, an abrupt transition from a lofty style or grand topic to a common or vulgar one. This may be either accidental (through artistic ineptitude) or intentional (for comic effect). Intentional bathos appears in satirical genres such as burlesque and mock epic. \"Bathos\" or \"bathetic\" is also used for similar effects in other branches of the arts, such as musical passages marked \"ridicolosamente\". In film, bathos may appear in a contrast cut intended for comic relief or be produced by an accidental jump cut.\n\nAs the combination of the very high with the very low, the term was introduced by Alexander Pope in his essay \"Peri Bathous, Or the Art of Sinking in Poetry\" (1727). On the one hand, Pope's work is a parody in prose of Longinus' \"Peri Hupsous\" (\"On the Sublime\"), in that he imitates Longinus's system for the purpose of ridiculing contemporary poets, but, on the other, it is a blow Pope struck in an ongoing struggle against the \"dunces.\"\n\nThe nearest model for Pope's essay is the \"Treatise of the Sublime\" by Boileau of 1712. Pope admired Boileau, but one of Pope's literary adversaries, Leonard Welsted, had issued a \"translation\" of Longinus in 1726 that was merely a translation of Boileau. Because Welsted and Pope's other foes were championing this \"sublime,\" Pope commented upon and countered their system with his \"Peri Bathos\" in the Swift-Pope-Gay-Arbuthnot \"Miscellanies.\" Whereas Boileau had offered a detailed discussion of all the ways in which poetry could ascend or be \"awe-inspiring,\" Pope offers a lengthy schematic of the ways in which authors might \"sink\" in poetry, satirizing the very men who were allied with Ambrose Philips. Pope and Philips had been adversaries since the publication of Pope's \"Odes,\" and the rivalry broke down along political lines. According to Pope, bathos can be most readily applicable to love making after two years of marriage which is clearly in binary opposition to the sublime but is no less political. Edmund Burke was believed to be particularly charmed by Pope's articulation of love after marriage, inspiring Burke's essay A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful (1756).\n\nOne example of Pope's style and satire shows in his description of sinking in painting. In the commonplace Academic hierarchic ranking of pictorial genres, still life ranked the lowest. However, Pope describes how it might fall and, with the single word \"stiffen,\" evokes the unnatural deadness that is a mark of failure even in this \"low\" genre:\n\nIn chapters X and XI, Pope explains the comic use of the tropes and figures of speech.\n\nAlthough Pope's manual of bad verse offers numerous methods for writing poorly, of all these ways to \"sink,\" the method that is most remembered now is the act of combining very serious matters with very trivial ones. The radical juxtaposition of the serious with the frivolous does two things. First, it violates \"decorum,\" or the fittingness of subject, and, second, it creates humor with an unexpected and improper juxtaposition.\n\nSince Pope's day, the term \"bathos,\" perhaps because of confusion with \"pathos,\" has been used for art forms, and sometimes events, where something is so \"pathetic\" as to be humorous.\n\nWhen artists consciously mix the very serious with the very trivial, the effect is of Surreal humour and the absurd. However, when an artist is unconscious of the juxtaposition (e.g., when a film maker means for a man in a gorilla suit with a diving helmet to be frightening), the result is bathos.\n\nArguably, some forms of kitsch (notably the replication of serious or sublime subjects in a trivial context, like tea-towels with prints of Titian's \"Last Supper\" on them or hand guns that are actually cigarette lighters) express bathos in the concrete arts.\n\nA tolerant but detached enjoyment of the aesthetic characteristics that are inherent in naive, unconscious and honest bathos is an element of the camp sensibility, as first analyzed by Susan Sontag, in a 1964 essay \"Notes on camp\".\n\nBathos as Pope described it may be found in a grandly rising thought that punctures itself: Pope offers one \"Master of a Show in Smithfield, who wrote in large Letters, over the Picture of his Elephant:\n\nSeveral decades before Pope coined the term, John Dryden had described one of the breath-taking and magically extravagant settings for his Restoration spectacular, \"Albion and Albanius\" (1684–85):\n\nPope himself employed this type of figure intentionally for humor in his mock-heroic \"Rape of the Lock,\" where a lady would be upset at the death of a lover \"or lapdog.\" Søren Kierkegaard, in \"The Sickness Unto Death,\" did the same thing, when he suggested that the \"self\" is easy to lose and that the loss of \"an arm, a leg, a dog, or a wife\" would be more grievous. When intended, this is a form of satire or the literary figure of \"undercutting.\" When the context demands a lofty, serious, or grand interpretation, however, the effect is bathos.\n\nIn 1764, William Hogarth published his last engraving, \"The Bathos, or the Manner of Sinking in Sublime Paintings inscribed to Dealers in Dark Pictures\", depicting Father Time lying exhausted in a scene of destruction, parodying the fashion at that time for \"sublime\" works of art, and satirising criticisms made of Hogarth's own works. It may also be seen as a \"vanitas\" or \"memento mori\", foreshadowing Hogarth's death six months later. Headed \"Tail Piece\", it was intended as the tailpiece for a bound edition of Hogarth's engravings.\n\nAlfred Lord Tennyson's narrative poem \"Enoch Arden\" ends with the following lines:\n\n<poem>So past the strong heroic soul away.\nAnd when they buried him the little port\nHad seldom seen a costlier funeral.</poem>\n\nAfter stanzas of heightened poetic language, the poet, in three short lines, wraps up a pathos-laden story with mundane and practical details. The effect yanks the reader out of the poetic world, simultaneously offering commentary on the finality of death and the transience of heroics.\n\nA musical representation is found in composer Igor Stravinsky's 1923 Octet for wind instruments. The first two movements and the majority of the third movement follow traditional classical structures, albeit employing modern and innovative harmonies. The last fifteen seconds of the 25-minute work, however, abruptly and whimsically turn to popular harmony, rhythm, and style found in contemporary dance hall music.\n\nContemporary examples often take the form of analogies, written to seem unintentionally funny:\nThe Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest features purple prose, at times exhibiting bathos:\nLegendary darts commentator Sid Waddell was famed for his one-liners, including this example:\n\n"}

The U.S. has been criticized for advocating free trade but while protecting local industries with import tariffs on foreign goods such as lumber and agricultural products. The U.S. has also been criticized for advocating concern for human rights while refusing to ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The U.S. has publicly stated that it is opposed to torture, but has been criticized for condoning it in the School of the Americas. The U.S. has advocated a respect for national sovereignty but has supported internal guerrilla movements and paramilitary organizations, such as the Contras in Nicaragua. The U.S. has been criticized for voicing concern about narcotics production in countries such as Bolivia and Venezuela but doesn't follow through on cutting certain bilateral aid programs. However, some defenders argue that a policy of rhetoric while doing things counter to the rhetoric was necessary in the sense of realpolitik and helped secure victory against the dangers of tyranny and totalitarianism.\n\nThe U.S. has been criticized for supporting dictatorships with economic assistance and military hardware.\n\nThe U.S. has been criticized by Noam Chomsky for opposing nationalist movements in foreign countries, including social reform.\n\nPresident Bush has been criticized for neglecting democracy and human rights by focusing exclusively on an effort to fight terrorism. The U.S. was criticized for alleged prisoner abuse at Guantánamo Bay, Abu Ghraib in Iraq, and secret CIA prisons in eastern Europe, according to Amnesty International. In response, the U.S. government claimed incidents of abuse were isolated incidents which did not reflect U.S. policy.\n\nSome critics charge that U.S. government aid should be higher given the high levels of gross domestic product. The U.S. pledged 0.7% of GDP at a global conference in Mexico. However, since the U.S. grants tax breaks to nonprofits, it subsidizes relief efforts abroad, although other nations also subsidize charitable activity abroad. Most foreign aid (79%) came not from government sources but from private foundations, corporations, voluntary organizations, universities, religious organizations and individuals. According to the Index of Global Philanthropy, the United States is the top donor in absolute amounts.\nThe U.S. has also been criticized for failure to support the 1997 Kyoto Protocol.\n\nIn 1930–1940 the US collaborated with Stalin regime by building around 1500 factories in the USSR using a slave labor of political prisoners. The USA also covered up genocide of East Ukraine in 1932–1933, that killed between 4 and 6 millions of Ukrainians and in the midst of it established a diplomatic relationship with the USSR.\n\nThere has been sharp criticism about the U.S. response to the Holocaust: That it failed to admit Jews fleeing persecution from Europe at the beginning of World War II, and that it did not act decisively enough to prevent or stop the Holocaust.\n\nCritic Robert McMahon thinks Congress has been excluded from foreign policy decision making, and that this is detrimental. Other writers suggest a need for greater Congressional participation.\n\nJim Webb, former Democratic senator from Virginia and former Secretary of the Navy in the Reagan administration, believes that Congress has an ever-decreasing role in U.S. foreign policy making. September 11, 2001 precipitated this change, where \"powers quickly shifted quickly to the Presidency as the call went up for centralized decision making in a traumatized nation where, quick, decisive action was considered necessary. It was considered politically dangerous and even unpatriotic to question this shift, lest one be accused of impeding national safety during a time of war.\"\n\nSince that time, Webb thinks Congress has become largely irrelevant in shaping and executing of U.S. foreign policy. He cites the Strategic Framework Agreement (SFA), the U.S.-Afghanistan Strategic Partnership Agreement, and the 2011 military intervention in Libya as examples of growing legislative irrelevance. Regarding the SFA, \"Congress was not consulted in any meaningful way. Once the document was finalized, Congress was not given the opportunity to debate the merits of the agreement, which was specifically designed to shape the structure of our long-term relations in Iraq\" (11). \"Congress did not debate or vote on this agreement, which set U.S. policy toward an unstable regime in an unstable region of the world.\" The Iraqi Parliament, by contrast, voted on the measure twice. The U.S.-Afghanistan Strategic Partnership Agreement is described by the Obama Administration has a \"legally binding executive agreement\" that outlines the future of U.S.-Afghan relations and designated Afghanistan a major non-NATO ally. \"It is difficult to understand how any international agreement negotiated, signed, and authored only by our executive branch of government can be construed as legally binding in our constitutional system,\" Webb argues.\n\nFinally, Webb identifies the U.S. intervention in Libya as a troubling historical precedent. \"The issue in play in Libya was not simply whether the president should ask Congress for a declaration of war. Nor was it wholly about whether Obama violated the edicts of the War Powers Act, which in this writer's view he clearly did. The issue that remains to be resolved is whether a president can unilaterally begin, and continue, a military campaign for reasons that he alone defines as meeting the demanding standards of a vital national interest worth of risking American lives and expending billions of dollars of taxpayer money.\" When the military campaign lasted months, President Barack Obama did not seek approval of Congress to continue military activity.\n\nOne difficulty of the American government is that the lack of oversight for Presidents offers no safeguards for presidential incompetency. For example, Barack Obama has been increasingly criticized for his expansive views on executive powers and mismanaging of several situation, including the Syrian Civil War. In addition, George W. Bush, who was criticized as entering the Iraq War too hastily, had no reproach for his advocacy of the war.\n\nGeorge H. W. Bush was criticized for stopping the first Iraq War too soon without finishing the task of capturing Saddam Hussein. Foreign policy expert Henry Kissinger criticized Jimmy Carter for numerous foreign policy mistakes including a decision to admit the ailing Shah of Iran into the United States for medical treatment, as well as a bungled military mission to try to rescue the hostages in Tehran.\n\nVirtually every President in modern history has been criticized for incompetency in some fashion. However, there are little to no mechanisms in place to provide accountability. Since the only way to remove an incompetent president is with the rather difficult policy of impeachment, it is possible for a marginally competent or incompetent president to stay in office for four to eight years and cause great mischief.\n\nPresidents have not only foreign policy responsibilities, but sizable domestic duties too. In addition, the presidency is the head of a political party. As a result, it is tough for one person to manage disparate tasks, in one view. Many believe that this overburdened duty of presidents allows for incompetency in government.\n\nSince the constitution requires no prior experience in diplomacy, government, or military service, it is possible to elect presidents with scant foreign policy experience. Clearly the record of past presidents confirms this, and that presidents who have had extensive diplomatic, military, and foreign policy experience have been the exception, not the rule. In recent years, presidents had relatively more experience in such tasks as peanut farming, acting and governing governorships than in international affairs. It has been debated whether voters are sufficiently skillful to assess the foreign policy potential of presidential candidates, since foreign policy experience is only one of a long list of attributes in which voters tend to select candidates. President Obama has been widely criticized as too inexperienced for the job, having only served in government for three years before his presidential election. However, party leadership and donors were adamant in their advocacy due his broad appeal, leading to a nominee with little experience.\n\nIn addition, an increasing difficulty for providing well-versed Presidents is that the American people in recent years are, in increasing numbers, more distrustful of their government and longterm, career politicians. As such, inexperienced candidates often perform better.\n\nIn contrast to criticisms that presidential attention is divided into competing tasks, some critics charge that presidents have too much power, and that there is the potential for tyranny or authoritarianism. Many presidents have circumvented the national security decision-making process, including Obama, Bush, Clinton, and Reagan, as well as others historically. Many critics see a danger in too much executive authority.\n\n\n\n<div style=\"font-size:95%\">\n"}

The many different ethnicities that currently exist in Malaysia have their own unique and distinctive cultural identities, with some crossover.\n\nArts and music have a long tradition in Malaysia, with Malay art dating back to the Malay sultanates. Traditional art was centred on fields such as carving, silversmithing, and weaving. Islamic taboos restricted artwork depicting humans until the mid-20th century. Performing arts and shadow puppet shows are popular, and often show Indian influences. Various influences can be seen in architecture, from individual cultures in Malaysia and from other countries. Large modern structures have been built, including the tallest twin buildings in the world, the Petronas Twin Towers. Malaysian music has a variety of origins, and is largely based around percussion instruments. Much early Malaysian literature was based on Indian epics, which remained unchanged even as Malays converted to Islam; this has expanded in recent decades. English literature remained restricted to the higher class until the arrival of the printing press. Locally created Chinese and Indian literature appeared in the 19th century.\n\nCuisine is often divided along ethnic lines, but some dishes exist which have mixed foods from different ethnicities. Each major religious group has its major holy days declared as official holidays. Official holidays differ by state; the most widespread one is Merdeka day which celebrates the independence of Malaya. Although festivals often stem from a specific ethnic background, they are celebrated by all people in Malaysia. Traditional sports are popular in Malaysia, while it has become a powerhouse in international sports such as badminton. Malaysia hosted the Commonwealth Games in 1998, the first Commonwealth Games where the torch passed through more countries than England and the host.\n\nThe Malaysian government has taken the step of defining Malaysian Culture through the \"1971 National Culture Policy\", which defined what was considered official culture, basing it around Malay culture and integrating Islamic influences. This especially affected language; only Malay texts are considered official cultural texts. Government control over the media is strong, and most media outlets are related to the government in some way.\n\nMalaysia consists of two distinct geographical regions: Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia. Malaysia was formed when the Federation of Malaya merged with North Borneo (today the province of Sabah), Sarawak, and Singapore (seceded 1965) in 1963, and cultural differences between Peninsular and East Malaysia remain. During the formation of Malaysia, executive power was vested in the Perikatan (later the Barisan Nasional) coalition of three racially based political parties, namely the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA), and Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC). UMNO has dominated the coalition from its inception. Although Islam is the official state religion, the Constitution of Malaysia guarantees freedom of religion.\n\nMalaysia is a multi–ethnic, multicultural, and multilingual society, and the many ethnic groups in Malaysia maintain separate cultural identities. The society of Malaysia has been described as \"Asia in miniature\". The original culture of the area stemmed from its indigenous tribes, along with the Malays who moved there in ancient times. Substantial influence exists from the Chinese and Indian cultures, dating back to when trade with those countries began in the area. Other cultures that heavily influenced that of Malaysia include Persian, Arabic, and British. The structure of the government, along with the racial balance of power caused by the idea of a social contract, has resulted in little incentive for the cultural assimilation of ethnic minorities in Malaya and Malaysia. The government has historically made little distinction between \"Malay culture\" and \"Malaysian culture\".\n\nThe Malays, who account for over half the Malaysian population, play a dominant role politically and are included in a grouping identified as bumiputra. Their native language, Bahasa Malaysia, is the national language of the country. By definition of the Malaysian constitution, all Malays are Muslims. The Orang Asal, the earliest inhabitants of Malaya, formed only 0.5 percent of the total population in Malaysia in 2000, but represented a majority in East Malaysia, Borneo. In Sarawak and Sabah, most of the non-Muslim indigenous groups are classified as Dayaks, and they constitute about 40 percent of the population in the state. Many tribes have converted to Christianity. The 140,000 Orang Asli, or aboriginal peoples, comprise a number of different ethnic communities living in peninsular Malaysia.\nThe Chinese have been settling in Malaysia for many centuries, and form the second-largest ethnic group. The first Chinese to settle in the Straits Settlements, primarily in and around Malacca, gradually adopted elements of Malaysian culture and intermarried with the Malaysian community and with this, a new ethnic group called emerged, the \"Peranakan\" (\"Straits Chinese\"). These Chinese have adopted Malay traditions while maintaining elements of Chinese culture such as their largely Buddhist and Taoist religion. The more common Chinese varieties spoken in Peninsular Malaysia are Cantonese, Mandarin, Hokkien, Hakka, Hainanese, and Fuzhou.\n\nThe Indian community in Malaysia is the smallest of the three main ethnic groups, accounting for about 10 percent of the country's population. They speak a variety of South Asian languages. Tamils, Malayalees, and Telugu people make up over 85 percent of the people of Indian origin in the country. Indian immigrants to Malaysia brought with them the Hindu and Sikh cultures. This included temples and Gurdwaras, cuisine, and clothing. Hindu tradition remains strong in the Indian community of Malaysia. A community of Indians who have adopted Malay cultural practices also exists in Malacca. Though they remain Hindu, the Chitties speak Bahasa Malaysia and dress and act as Malays.\n\nSome Eurasians of mixed European and Malay descent live in Malaysia. A small community in Malacca are descendants of former Portuguese colonists who married Malay women. While they have adopted Malay culture, they speak their own language and are Catholics.\n\nEach ethnic group has its own underlying culture that separates it from the others, and they have achieved different levels of integration. The Chinese have integrated with Malay culture in a number of areas, including parts of Terengganu, and they form Malayanised groups such as the Baba Chinese in Malacca and the Sino-Kadazan of Sabah. Their years under combined British rule brought some joint sense of identity to all the ethnic groups, with English ideas and ideals providing some unifying features. A joint Malaysian culture can be seen in the symbiosis of the cultures of the people within it.\n\nThe Malaysian government defined Malaysian culture through the issuance of the \"1971 National Culture Policy\". It defines three principles as guidelines for Malaysian culture: that it is based on the cultures of indigenous people; that if elements from other cultures are judged suitable and reasonable they may be considered Malaysian culture; and that Islam will be an important part of national culture.\n\nSome cultural disputes exist between Malaysia and neighbouring Indonesia. The two countries share a similar cultural heritage, sharing many traditions and items. However, disputes have arisen over things ranging from culinary dishes to Malaysia's national anthem. Strong feelings exist in Indonesia about protecting that nation's national heritage. The rivalry between the two countries began during Konfrontasi just after Malaysian independence, when Indonesia and Malaysia were almost at war. Building resentment since then coupled with the economic success of Malaysia mean these feelings are still strong in Indonesia today. The Malaysian government and the Indonesian government have met to defuse some of the tensions resulting from the overlaps in culture. Feelings are not as strong in Malaysia, where most recognise that many cultural values are shared.\n\nOne dispute, known as the Pendet controversy, began when Indonesians claimed the Pendet Dance was used in an official Malaysian tourism ad campaign, causing official protests. This dance, from Bali in Indonesia, was used only in a Discovery Channel ad, not an ad sponsored by the Malaysian government. Songs, such as the Rasa Sayange song, have caused similar controversies. The Malaysian national anthem, Negaraku, was claimed to be based on a similar Indonesian song written a year earlier. Both tunes are derived from a 19th century French song, which caused the similarity.\n\nTraditional Malaysian art is mainly centred on the crafts of carving, weaving, and silversmithing. Traditional art ranges from handwoven baskets from rural areas to the silverwork of the Malay courts. Common artworks included ornamental kris and beetle nut sets. Luxurious textiles known as \"Songket\" are made, as well as traditional patterned batik fabrics. Indigenous East Malaysians are known for their wooden masks. Malaysian art has expanded only recently, as before the 1950s Islamic taboos about drawing people and animals were strong. Textiles such as the batik, songket, Pua Kumbu, and tekat are used for decorations, often embroidered with a painting or pattern. Traditional jewelry was made from gold and silver adorned with gems, and, in East Malaysia, leather and beads were used to the same effect.\n\nEarthenware has been developed in many areas. The Labu Sayong is a gourd-shaped clay jar that holds water. Perak is famous for these. Also used to store water is the angular Terenang. The belanga is a clay bowl used to cook, with a wide base that allows heat to spread easily. Carved wood is used as ornamentation for many items, such as doors and window panels. Woodcarving was never an industry, but an art. Traditional woodcarvers spent years simply preparing the wood, due to a belief that woodcarvers need to be a perfect match with their wood. The wood also had to match the buyer, so woodcarving was a very ritualised task.\n\nEach ethnic group has distinct performing arts, with little overlap between them. Malay art shows some North Indian influence. A form of art called mak yong, incorporating dance and drama, remains strong in the Kelantan state. However, older Malayan-Thai performing arts such as mak yong have declined in popularity throughout the country due to their Hindu-Buddhist origin. Since the Islamisation period, the arts and tourism ministry have focused on newer dances of Portuguese, Middle Eastern, or Mughal origin. Malay traditional dances include joget melayu and zapin. In recent years, dikir barat has grown in popularity, and it is actively promoted by state governments as a cultural icon. Silat is another popular Malay martial art and dance form, believed to increase a person's spiritual strength. \"Wayang kulit\" (shadow puppet theatre) has been popular in Malaysia for centuries. The puppets are usually made with cow and buffalo skin, and are carved and painted by hand. Plays done with shadow puppets are often based on traditional stories, especially tales from the \"Ramayana\" and the \"Mahabharata\". Traditionally, theatrical music is performed only by men. Javanese immigrants brought Kuda Kepang to Johor, and is a form of dance where dancers sit on mock horses and tells the tales of Islamic wars. The Chinese communities brought traditional lion dances and dragon dances with them, while Indians brought art forms such as Bharata Natyam and Bhangra. Colonialism also brought other art forms, such as the Portuguese Farapeira and Branyo. There are a variety of traditional dances, which often have very strong spiritual significance. Different tribes from west and east Malaysia have different dances.\n\nIn 2010, the Malaysian Art Culture was introduced to a new revival with the arrival of new independent galleries that focuses on the new contemporary young local artists. One of the most prominent key players in this new counter-culture is Minut Init Art Social in Uptown Damansara.\n\nArchitecture in Malaysia is a combination of many styles, from Islamic and Chinese styles to those brought by European colonists. Malay architecture has changed due to these influences. Houses in the north are similar to those in Thailand, while those in the south are similar to those in Java. New materials, such as glasses and nails, were brought in by Europeans, changing the architecture. Houses are built for tropical conditions, raised on stilts with high roofs and large windows, allowing air to flow through the house and cool it down. Wood has been the main building material for much of Malaysia's history; it is used for everything from the simple \"kampung\" to royal palaces. In Negeri Sembilan traditional houses are entirely free of nails. Besides wood, other common materials such as bamboo and leaves were used. The Istana Kenangan in Kuala Kangsar was built in 1926, and it the only Malay palace with bamboo walls. The Oral Asal of East Malaysia live in longhouses and water villages. Longhouses are elevated and on stilts, and can house 20 to 100 families. Water villages are also built on stilts, with houses connected with planks and most transport by boats.\n\nChinese architecture can be divided into two types, traditional and Baba Nyonya. Baba Nyonya households are made of colourful tiles and have large indoor courtyards. Indian architecture came with the Malaysian Indians, reflecting the architecture of southern India where most originated from. Some Sikh architecture was also imported. Malacca, which was a traditional centre of trade, has a large variety of building styles. Large wooden structures such as the Palace of Sultan Mansur Shah exist from early periods. Chinese influence can be seen in brightly decorated temples and terraced shop houses. The largest remaining Portuguese structure in Malacca is the A Famosa fort. Other colonial building include the Dutch Stadthuys, the Dutch Colonial town brick buildings, and buildings built by the British such as the Memorial Hall, which combines Baroque and Islamic architecture.\n\nThe shapes and sizes of houses differ from state to state. Common elements in Peninsular Malaysia include pitched roofs, verandahs, and high ceilings, raised on stilts for ventilation. The woodwork in the house is often intricately carved. The floors are at different levels depending on the function of the room. Mosques have traditionally been based on Javanese architecture. In modern times, the government has promoted different projects, from the tallest twin buildings in the world, the Petronas Twin Towers, to a whole garden city, Putrajaya. Malaysian firms are developing skyscraper designs that are specifically for tropical climates.\n\nTraditional Malay music and performing arts appear to have originated in the Kelantan-Pattani region. The music is based around percussion instruments, the most important of which is the gendang (drum). There are at least 14 types of traditional drums. Drums and other traditional percussion instruments are often made from natural materials such as shells. Other instruments include the rebab (a bowed string instrument), the serunai (a double-reed oboe-like instrument), the seruling (flute), and trumpets. Music is traditionally used for storytelling, celebrating life-cycle events, and at annual events such as the harvest. Music was once used as a form of long-distance communication. Traditional orchestra can be divided between two forms, the gamelan which plays melodies using gongs and string instruments, and the nobat which uses wind instruments to create more solemn music.\n\nIn East Malaysia, ensembles based around gongs such as agung and kulintang are commonly used in ceremonies such as funerals and weddings. These ensembles are also common in the southern Philippines, Kalimantan in Indonesia, and in Brunei. Chinese and Indian Malaysians have their own forms of music, and the indigenous tribes of Peninsula and East Malaysia have unique traditional instruments. In countries such as Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia it is believed that performing at the house during Hari Raya (a traditional malay festival) is a good belief as it brings goodluck and fortune to the performers and host of the house.\n\nWithin Malaysia, the largest performing arts venue is the Petronas Philharmonic Hall. The resident orchestra is the Malaysian Philharmonic Orchestra. Malay popular music is a combination of styles from all ethnicities in the country. The Malaysian government has taken steps to control what music is available in Malaysia; rap music has been criticised, heavy metal has been limited, and foreign bands must submit a recording of a recent concert before playing in Malaysia. It is believed that this music is a bad influence on youth.\n\nThe strong oral tradition that has existed since before the arrival of writing to what is now Malaysia continues today. These early works were heavily influenced by Indian epics. Oral literature such as folktales flourished even after printed works appeared. The Arabic Jawi script arrived with the coming of Islam to the peninsula in the late 15th century. At this point, stories which previously had given lessons in Hinduism and Buddhism were taken to have more universal meanings, with their main story lines remaining intact. Each of the Malay Sultanates created their own literary tradition influenced by preexisting oral stories and by the stories that came with Islam. The arrival of the printing press in Malaysia was key in allowing literature to be accessed by more than those rich enough to afford handwritten manuscripts. There was a division between the royal Malays, who knew English, and the lower classes, who only read Malay. In the early years of the 20th century, literature began to change to reflect the changing norms of Malaysians. In 1971 the government took the step of defining the literature of different languages. Literature written in Malay was called \"The National Literature of Malaysia\"; literature in other bumiputra languages was called \"regional literature\"; literature in other languages was called \"sectional literature\".\n\nMalay poetry is highly developed, and uses many forms. A \"Hikayat\" is a traditional narrative, and stories written in that fashion are named using Hikayat followed by the name(s) of the protagonist(s). The \"pantun\" is a form of poetry used in many aspects of Malay culture. The \"Syair\" is another form of narrative, once very popular. The Hikayat form remains popular, and the pantun has spread from Malay to other languages. Until the 19th century, literature produced in Malaysia focused mainly on tales of royalty, as it was produced just for royalty. It was after this point that it expanded to other areas. The race riots of 1969 strongly influenced literature; the improvements of the economy in the 1980s brought about social changes and new forms of literature.\n\nThe first Malay literature was in Arabic script. The earliest known Malay writing is on the Terengganu Inscription Stone, made in 1303. One of the more famous Malay works is the \"Sulalatus al-Salatin\", also known as the \"Sejarah Melayu\" (meaning \"The Malay Annals\"). It was originally recorded in the 15th century, although it has since been edited; the known version is from the 16th century. The \"Hikaya Rajit Pasai\", written in the 15th century, is another significant literary work. The \"Hikayat Hang Tuah\", or story of Hang Tuah, tells the story of Hang Tuah and his devotion to his Sultan. This is the most famous Hikayat; it drew from the \"Sejarah Melayu\". Both have been nominated as world heritage items under the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) 'Memory of the World' programme. Folktales such as the \"Hikayat Sang Kancil\", about a clever mouse deer, are popular, as are adventures such as \"Ramayana\", adapted from Indian epics. Munshi Abdullah (Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir), who lived from 1797 to 1854, is regarded as the father of Malay literature. \"Hikayat Abdullah\", his autobiography, is about everyday life at the time when British influence was spreading. Female Malay writers began becoming popular in the 1950s.\n\nDifferent ethnic and linguistic groups have produced works in their own languages. Chinese and Indian literature became common as the numbers of speakers increased in Malaysia, and locally produced works based in languages from those areas began to be produced in the 19th century. Beginning in the 1950s, Chinese literature expanded; homemade literature in Indian languages has failed to emerge. English has become a common literary language.\n\nMalaysia's cuisine reflects the multiethnic makeup of its population, and is defined by its diversity. Many cultures from Malaysia and the surrounding areas have greatly influenced Malaysian cuisine, with strong influence from Malay, Chinese, Indian, Thai, Javanese, and Sumatran cuisines. Much of this is due to Malaysia being a part of the ancient spice route. The cuisine is very similar to that of Singapore and Brunei, and also bears resemblance to Filipino cuisine. The different states of Malaysia have varied dishes, and often the food in Malaysia is different from the original dishes.\n\nSometimes food not found in its original culture is assimilated into another; for example, Chinese restaurants in Malaysia often serve Malaysian dishes. Food from one culture is sometimes cooked using styles taken from another. This means that although many Malaysian dishes originate from another culture, they have their own identities. Often the food in Malaysia is different from the original dishes; for example, Chinese food is often sweeter in Malaysian versions than the original. The Peranakans, Chinese who moved to Malaysia centuries ago, have their own unique cuisine that Chinese cooking techniques with Malay ingredients.\n\nDuring a dinner food is not served in courses, but all at once. Rice is popular in many Malaysian dishes. Chilli is commonly found in Malaysian dishes, although this does not make them spicy. Noodles are common. Pork is rarely used in Malaysia, because of the large Muslim population. Some celebrations have food associated with them, and mooncakes are often eaten during Mooncake Festival.\n\nAs of 2013 most Muslim Malaysian women wear the tudung, a type of hijab. This use of the tudung was uncommon prior to the 1979 Iranian revolution, and the places that had women in tudung tended to be rural areas. The usage of the tudung sharply increased after the 1970s. as religious conservatism among Malay people in both Malaysia and Singapore increased.\n\nSeveral members of the Kelantan ulama in the 1960s believed the hijab was not mandatory. By 2015 the Malaysian ulama believed this previous viewpoint was un-Islamic.\n\nBy 2015 Malaysia had a fashion industry related to the tudung. By 2015 Muslim Malay society had a negative reaction to Muslim women who do not wear tudung.\n\nNorhayati Kaprawi directed a 2011 documentary about the use of tudung in Malaysia, \"Siapa Aku?\" (\"Who am I?\"). It is in Malay, with English subtitles available.\n\nMalaysians observe a number of holidays and festivities throughout the year, on both the federal and state level. Other festivals are observed by particular ethnic or religion groups, but are not public holidays. The main holy days of each major religion are public holidays. The most widespread holiday is the \"Hari Merdeka\" (Independence Day), otherwise known as \"Merdeka\" (Freedom), on 31 August. It commemorates the independence of the Federation of Malaya. This, as well as Labour Day (1 May), the King's birthday (first Saturday of June), and some other festivals are major national public holidays. Federal Territory day is celebrated in the three Federal territories. Malaysia Day, held on 16 September, commemorates the formation of Malaysia through the union of Malaya, Singapore, Sabah, and Sarawak, although it is celebrated mainly in East Malaysia.\n\nNew Year's Day, Chinese New Year, and the start of the Islamic calendar are all public holidays. Muslim holidays are highly prominent in Malaysia. The most important of these is \"Hari Raya Puasa\" (also called \"Hari Raya Aidilfitri\"), which is the Malay translation of Eid al-Fitr. It is a festival honoured by Muslims worldwide marking the end of Ramadan, the fasting month. They also celebrate Hari Raya Haji (also called \"Hari Raya Aidiladha\", the translation of Eid ul-Adha), Awal Muharram (Islamic New Year) and Maulidur Rasul (Birthday of the Prophet).\n\nMalaysian Chinese typically hold the same festivals observed by Chinese around the world. Chinese New Year is the most prominent, lasting for 15 days. Hindus in Malaysia celebrate Deepavali, the festival of light, while Thaipusam is a celebration in which pilgrims from all over the country meet at the Batu Caves. Wesak (Malay for Vesak), the day of Buddha's birth, is a public holiday. Malaysia's Christian community observes most of the holidays observed by Christians elsewhere, most notably Christmas and Easter. Good Friday, however, is only a public holiday in the two Bornean states. The harvest festivals of Gawai in Sarawak and Kaamatan in Sabah are also important for East Malaysians.\n\nDespite most of the festivals being identified with a particular ethnic or religious group, festivities are often participated in by all Malaysians. One example of this is the celebration of \"Kongsi Raya\", which is celebrated when Hari Raya Puasa and Chinese New Year coincide. The term \"Kongsi Raya\" (which means \"sharing the celebration\" in Malay) was coined because of the similarity between the word \"kongsi\" and the Chinese New Year greeting of \"Gong xi fa cai\". Similarly, the portmanteau \"Deepa Raya\" was coined when Hari Raya Puasa and Deepavali coincided.\n\nA practice known as \"open house\" (\"rumah terbuka\") is common during the festivities, especially during Hari Raya Aidilfitri, Deepavali, Chinese New Year, and Christmas. Open house means that all well-wishers are received and that everyone, regardless of background, is invited to attend. Open houses are normally held at the home of the host and foods are prepared by the host. There are also open houses held at larger public venues, especially when hosted by government agencies or corporations. Most Malaysians take the time off work or school to return to their hometowns to celebrate the festivities with their extended relatives. This practice is commonly known as \"balik kampung\" and usually causes traffic jams on most highways in the country.\n\nPopular sports in Malaysia include badminton, bowling, football, squash, and field hockey. Malaysia has small-scale traditional sports. Wau is a traditional form of kite-flying involving kites created with intricate designs. These kites can reach heights of nearly , and due to bamboo attachments create a humming sound when flown. Sepak takraw is a game in which a rattan ball is kept in the air without using hands. A traditional game played during the rice harvest season was throwing gasing, which are large tops weighing around , which are thrown by unfurling a rope and scooped off the ground while spinning. They are known to be able to spin for over an hour. Other sports are dragon dancing and dragon-boat racing. Malaysia's coastline is popular for scuba diving, sailing, and other water sports and activities. Whitewater rafting and trekking are also often done.\n\nMany international sports are highly popular in Malaysia. Badminton matches in Malaysia attract thousands of spectators, and Malaysia, along with Indonesia and China, has consistently held the Thomas Cup since 1949. Famous players include Lee Chong Wei. The Malaysian Lawn Bowls Federation (PLBM) was registered in 1997, and already fields a strong international team and has made progress on the international stage. Squash was brought to Malaysia by members of the British army, with the first competition being held in 1939. The Squash Racquets Association of Malaysia (SRAM) was created on 25 June 1972, and has had great success in Asian squash competitions. Football is popular in Malaysia, and Malaysia has proposed a Southeast Asian football league. Hockey is popular in Malaysia, with the Malaysian team ranked 14th in the world as of 2010. Malaysia hosted the third Hockey World Cup at the Merdeka Stadium in Kuala Lumpur, before also hosting the 10th cup. Malaysia has its own Formula One track, the Sepang International Circuit. It runs for , and held its first Grand Prix in 2000. Golf is growing in popularity, with many courses being built around the country.\nThe Federation of Malaya Olympic Council was formed in 1953, and received recognition by the International Olympic Committee in 1954. It first participated in the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games. The council was renamed the Olympic Council of Malaysia in 1964, and has participated in all but one Olympic games since the council was formed. The largest number of athletes sent to the Olympics was 57, to the 1972 Munich Olympic Games. Malaysian athletes have won a total of four Olympic medals, all of which are in badminton. Malaysia has competed at the Commonwealth Games since 1950 as Malaya, and 1966 as Malaysia. It has been dominant in badminton, and hosted the games in Kuala Lumpur in 1998. The 1998 Commonwealth Games were the first time the torch relay went through more nations than just England and the host country.\n\nMuch of the Malaysian media is tied to the ruling UMNO party, with the county's main newspaper owned by the government and political parties in the ruling coalition. Major opposition parties also have their own newspapers. Besides Malay newspapers, there is large circulation of English, Chinese, and Tamil dailies. The media has been blamed for increasing tension between Indonesia and Malaysia, and giving Malaysians a bad image of Indonesians. There is a divide between the media in the two halves of Malaysia. Peninsular-based media gives low priority to news from East Malaysia, and often treats it as a colony of the Peninsular. Internet access is rare outside the main urban centres, and those of the lower classes have less access to non-government news sources.\n\nThe regulated freedom of the press has been criticised, and it has been claimed that the government threatens journalists with reduced employment opportunities and denial of family admittance to universities. The Malaysian government has previously tried to crack down on opposition papers before elections when the ruling party was unsure of its political situation. In 2007, a government agency issued a directive to all private television and radio stations to refrain from broadcasting speeches made by opposition leaders, a move condemned by politicians from the opposition Democratic Action Party. Sabah, where only one tabloid is not independent of government control, has the freest press in Malaysia. Legislation such as the Printing Presses and Publications Act has been cited as curtailing freedom of expression. The Malaysian government has large control over the media due to this Act, which stipulates that a media organisation must have the government's permission to operate. However, the \"Bill of Guarantee of No Internet Censorship\" passed in the 1990s means that internet news is uncensored.\n\nMalaysian filming has gone through five stages. The first stage occurred when narrative filmmaking began in 1933, with the production of Laila Majnun by a company operating out of Singapore. For the first couple of decades following World War II, most films were directed by directors from India and the Philippines, which produced a second stage of movies. The first locally directed film, Permata di-Perlembahan, was produced in 1952. It however failed in the cinemas. A third stage appeared as Singapore-based studios began to produce films in the 1950s, but the industry was subsequently damaged due to independence of Singapore and the loss of studios there. Indonesian films gained popularity at this time, although a small group of filmmakers continued to produce in Malaysia, forming the fourth stage. In the 1980s the local industry began to recover, bringing about the fifth and most eloquent stage, which covered more themes than any previous stage. This was also the first time non-Malay films began to have a significant presence.\n\nThe government began to sponsor films in 1975, creating the National Film Development Corporation in 1981. Through this the government offers loans to filmmaker's who want to develop films, however the criteria for obtaining funds has been criticised as promoting only commercial films. Due to this lack of government funding for smaller projects, a strong independent film movement has developed. There has been a large increase in short films, which in the past two decades have begun to gain status in international film festivals. Independent documentaries often cover areas which would normally be censored by the government, such as sex and sexuality, as well as racial inequality and tension. Although the government has criticised some films for not showing multiculturalism, its actions have been inconsistent in that respect, and often favour the Malay culture over others.\n\n\n"}

Gr. \"εὐγενής\" (eugenēs) 'well-born') were a semi-mythical Proto-Italic ethnic group that dwelt an area among Adriatic Sea and Rhaetian Alps. Subsequently, they were driven by the Adriatic Veneti to an area between the river Adige and Lake Como, where they remained until the early Roman Empire.\n\nThey may have been a Pre-Indo-European people, ethnically related to the Ingauni, as suggested by the similarity of the names.

Their descendants settled west of the Athesis (Adige) river, around the lakes Sebinus, Edrus and Benacus, where they occupied 34 towns, which were admitted by Augustus to the rights of Latin municipalities.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "43456819", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43456819", "title": "Furi", "text": "Furi\n\nFuri is an action shoot 'em up video game developed and published by indie studio The Game Bakers available for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. The game takes place on a planet in a colorful, retro, science fiction setting.\n\n\"Furi\" is a fast-paced action game with hack and slash, twin-stick shoot 'em up, and \"bullet hell\" elements, consisting entirely of boss fights. Gameplay consists mostly of dodging bullets, parrying attacks, attacking the bosses by melee or shooting, and quick time events. The game is set in closed world environments. Much of the game's story progresses through these interactions, along with animated cutscenes occurring before and after a boss fight.\n\nA mysterious man spends his existence receiving endless torture within a highly advanced prison, composed of ten islands floating in orbit above a planet's surface. At the beginning of the game, an enigmatic man wearing a rabbit disguise who is known as The Voice frees the Stranger, gives him a sword and gun, and encourages him to fight for his freedom.\n\nThe Stranger must navigate each area, wherein dwells a single powerful guardian who exists only to prevent him from escaping: The Chain, a sadistic staff-wielding jailor who tortured the Stranger; The Strap, a prisoner armed with a laser cannon on her head driven mad from her imprisonment; The Line, a wise old man who wields a sword longer than his body and can manipulate time; The Scale, a vengeful diver armed with twin harpoons; The Hand, a noble knight who was responsible for imprisoning the Stranger in the first place; The Song, an angelic woman armed with twin crossbows who conceived the prison; The Burst, a sniper and master tactician; The Edge, an oar-wielding warrior who dedicated his life to fighting The Stranger; and The Beat, a young woman who strives to guard the final door.\n\nAs the journey goes on, more about the reasons for imprisoning the Stranger surface, and the Voice reveals that he was the architect who created the prison to protect the planet from the Stranger, but he could not stand being locked in it, and freed the Stranger to be able to escape with him so that he could see his daughter again. Upon reaching the planet's surface, the Stranger finds that his mere presence destroys all physical structures on the planet, including living things. Later exploring the planet more, the Stranger ventures into a structure which holds an attachable device he uses to fly off the planet and into space to meet The Star, the mothership who created him, and many other clones like him. She calls him Rider.\n\nThe game contains two normal endings and a secret ending. When facing The Star, Rider can decide to either assimilate the planet or refuse to obey the mothership, thus prompting the tenth and final boss fight against The Star. By assimilating the planet, Rider allows The Star to send out an army of other warriors like him to invade the planet. By refusing to obey the mothership and canceling the invasion, Rider battles and destroys The Star, preventing the planet from being invaded. The secret ending can occur by accepting The Song's offer to stay in her sanctuary-like section of the prison, where she will provide for The Rider. She claims that this will make her the hero of all her people.\n\nThe \"One More Fight\" DLC provides an additional boss, a cyborg called The Flame who challenges the Stranger in an arena beneath the structure holding the Stranger's flying rig. Like The Scale, he seeks vengeance on the Stranger for what happened to his world. If the player defeats The Flame and all other bosses on the highest difficulty setting, they will unlock the hardest fight in the game: a basically modeled figure known as Bernard who fights using an amalgamation of the other bosses' attacks.\n\n\"Furi\" received \"generally favorable\" reviews, getting a critic score of 76 based off 12 critics on PC, and a 77 based off 37 critics on PlayStation 4 according to review aggregator Metacritic. James Davenport of PC Gamer gave it an 86 out of 100, claiming it \"is only held back by rare bugs and poorly designed difficulty spikes.\" Jeff Marchiafava of Game Informer gave it a 6 out of 10, citing a lack of engagement in the environment and unforgiving difficulty.\n"}
{"id": "5388826", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5388826", "title": "Gas-s-s-s", "text": "Gas-s-s-s\n\nGas-s-s-s (also known as Gas! or It Became Necessary to Destroy the World in Order to Save It) is a 1970 motion picture produced and released by American International Pictures. \n\nIt was producer Roger Corman's final film for AIP, after a long association. He was unhappy because AIP made several cuts to the film without his approval, including removing the final shot where God commented on the action — a shot Corman regarded as one of the greatest he had made in his life.\n\nThe movie is a post-apocalyptic dark comedy, about survivors of an accidental military gas leak, of an experimental agent that kills everyone on Earth over the age of 25. (A cartoon title sequence shows a John Wayne-esque Army General announcing — and denouncing — the \"accident\"; the story picks up after the victims have died.)\n\nThe lead characters, Coel and Cilla, were played by Robert Corff and Elaine Giftos, and the cast features Ben Vereen, Cindy Williams, Bud Cort and Talia Shire (credited as \"Tally Coppola\") in early roles. Country Joe McDonald makes an appearance, as spokesman \"AM Radio\".\n\nIn Dallas, at the Southern Methodist University, news comes in about a gas which has escaped from a military facility. It starts killing everyone over 25.\n\nHippie Coel meets and falls in love with Cilla. They discover a Gestapo-like police force will be running Dallas and flee into the country.\n\nTheir car is stolen by some cowboys. They then meet music fan Marissa, her boyfriend Carlos, Hooper and his girlfriend Coralee. Marissa leaves Carlos, who finds a new girlfriend.\n\nThe group meet Edgar Allan Poe who drives around on a motorbike with a girl on the back. They then have an encounter with some bikers who play golf, after which they attend a dance and concert where AM Radio is performing and passing on messages from God. Coel sleeps with Zoe, but Cilla is not jealous.\n\nCoel, Cilla and their friends arrive at a peaceful commune where it seems mankind can start fresh. Then a football team attacks them.\n\nEventually God intervenes. Coel and Cilla are reunited with all their friends and there is a big party where everyone gets along.\n\n\nGeorge Armitage had met Roger Corman at 20th Century Fox when the latter was making \"The St Valentine's Day Massacre\". Armitage later recalled he wrote a script — \"it was called either \"Carrot Butts\" or \"A Christmas Carrot\" — which had animated cartoon characters, Bugs Bunny and so on, coming to life. It was about the studio systems and all this stuff.\" His agent gave the script to Gene [Corman, Roger's brother], who gave it to Roger, \"and he loved it, so they submitted it to UA (United Artists) where they had a deal—Mike Medavoy was just taking over there and he was younger than I was. From there, Roger said: \"Well, that didn't work, why don't we try something else?\" Usually he has a title or something and he'll say: \"Go ahead, write something, just keep the title.\"\"\n\n\"Gas-s-s-s\" was an idea of Corman's, about a world where everybody over thirty had died. Corman later said \"my first thought was to do a science fiction film with allegorical overtones.\" Armitage remembers the concept just being \"a sentence, and that's what we went with ... He let you make it your own, and I did.\"\n\nCorman said that although \"there was some good work in\" Armitage's first draft, \"the points I was trying to make in the script either did not come through or came through too obviously different parts, and it became less science fiction and more and more a direct liberal left wing statement picture. I didn't want to be quite that obvious about what I was doing. So I then decided to switch to a comedy, thinking back to \"Bucket of Blood\" and \"Little Shop of Horrors\".\"\n\nUnited Artists had financed the script but Corman says they felt it was too risky to finance, as they believed it needed a budget of two million dollars. Corman bought the script back off them and decided to finance the film himself, at around $300,000.\n\nCorman says filming commenced using a first draft, which was rewritten constantly throughout the shoot.\n\nArmitage recalls, \"We went back in '69 to shoot in New Mexico and Texas. I was the associate producer as well, and we were writing it as we went—which is something that Roger liked to do.\n\n\"Winter was coming and I wanted to do the film,\" said Corman. \"I was going to be shooting in New Mexico. I actually shot in December and to wait one more month would have put me in January and I could not have made the film. To wait till next summer would have dated the material I was dealing with, so I wanted to bring the film out early.\"\n\n\"It was a very inexpensive film,\" said Corman. \"It was shot with a skeleton crew, with a cast of almost entirely amateur actors. Only the leads were professionals.\"\n\nShooting took around four weeks. Corman sold the movie to American International Pictures for the negative cost.\n\nThe film features a tribute to Edgar Allan Poe. Corman says \"It was actually a second thought when we put Poe in it. We just started putting things in. In the original concept, he wasn't in it. And we just decided to put him in on a motorcycle—it seemed appropriate.\"\n\n\"There was some sense of disorganization and experimentation as we went along,\" says Corman.\nCorman says the film showed \n\nthat I was beginning to get a little disillusioned\" with the youth culture of the time. \"I intended that the picture be sympathetic toward our lead gang of kids yet, at the same time, I wanted to show that I was beginning to suspect that all of the ideas being spouted by the counter-culture and all of the dreams were not totally rooted in reality. In the picture, I wanted to literally give youth the world they desired and, then, make a cautionary statement about how youth might not be able to handle it as perfectly as they anticipated.\n\nCorman said there were themes in the film \"which go back through all my previous pictures, such as the theme of the destruction of the world which I've played with to a certain extent, and there are some certain political and religious overtones I've dealt with before but I've never put them all together like this. The film became something I firmly believe in.\"\n\nHe added in 1971 that the film was \n\nan attempt to look at certain aspects of the youth movement and an attempt to move to a better way of life. I end there with something 1 probably believe, which is that there is a struggle and that it is possible to overcome but not necessarily probable. It's not like some of the youth films that have come out in the last couple of years that have been an unquestioning acceptance of all the values of the youth culture. I've just been around too long to accept anything unquestioningly. This would be a kind of questioning acceptance of many of the values but not all of this culture. For that reason I'm not certain \"gasss\" will be a success ... Also the film is a little flawed in some areas.\n\nRoger Corman was angry about what AIP did to the film. He later wrote:\n\nCorman elaborated, saying he had God \n\nplayed by an actor with an outrageous New York Jewish accent and they were really startled by that. But cutting God really took the heart out of the picture. I think it was partially the fact that AIP had become a public company and Sam was Jewish and they didn't want to be accused of being anti-Semitic.\n\nSamuel Z. Arkoff of AIP recalled it differently:\n\nCorman says the film opened and the Edinburgh Film Festival and he \"got a cable from the organizers of the festival saying, \"\"gasss\" explodes. Five minutes standing ovation.\" I thought, \"Boy, I've really got one.\"\n\nThe film premiered in New York as part of a retrospective on Roger Corman's work.\n\nIn 1971 Corman stated:\n\nAIP hates the picture. They dislike it intensely and they would not give it a New York opening. Since it's a very inexpensive picture, they've been playing it around the country in drive-ins and small towns where it's been doing only moderate business. The projection is that it will break even and possibly make a tiny profit. They don't want to spend the money to open in New York because it's very expensive to open right in New York. They feel it will not do well here and will turn a possibly slight loser into a slight failure. Because of the retrospective we have an essentially free opening here. However, I'm not quite as optimistic about the picture as I was after the news of the Edinburgh Festival. The fact that its been playing around to only moderate audiences may indicate some weaknesses in the film. On the other hand, it could mean that it's been playing to the wrong audiences.\n\nAccording to Samuel Z. Arkoff, \"when \"Gas-s-s-s\" was released, it was promoted with ads that proclaimed, 'Invite a few friends over to watch the end of the world.' The picture didn't make any money.\"\n\nCorman later reflected:\n\nOne of the great problems is that the film is far too intellectual. Other people have told me that they think it's a meaningless film. They may well be both right. It is the most intricate and the most organized intellectual film that I have ever made. I was so careful to keep each concept deep behind a humorous look at it. I didn't want at any time to allow the preachings of what I was saying to come across too heavily and disturb the flow of the picture and its humor. In my desire to keep it in the background, I may have kept it so far in the background that I'm the only person who is going to know what is in every scene.\n\nIt was the last film Corman directed for AIP, and he only made one more movie before a twenty-year sabbatical. \"\n\nA great deal of care went into what I was saying and how I was going to say it,\" he said of \"Gas-s-s-s\". \"The finished picture does not evidently make all these points. It discourages me and so for a little while I prefer to step away ... Directing is very hard and very painful. Producing is easy. I can do it without really thinking about it.\n\nCorman did, however, go on to produce \"Boxcar Bertha\" for AIP.\n\n\"Gas-s-s-s\" found a fresh airing on late night television in the 1980s. In 2005 it was issued on DVD, as a double feature with \"Wild in the Streets\", another AIP movie.\n\n\n"}

Behring Center, located in Washington, D.C., on the National Mall. The kitchen is not a replica, but is the actual kitchen used by noted 20th-century cookbook author and cooking show host Julia Child, appearing as the backdrop to several of her television shows.\n\nBuilt in Child's home on Irving Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1961, the kitchen was designed by her husband, Paul Cushing Child with 38-inch high countertops, rather than the standard 36-inch height, for her 6-foot-2-inch frame. Paul also selected the light blue-green color scheme dominating the kitchen's panels.\n\nIt was the setting for three of her television shows: \"In Julia's Kitchen with Master Chefs\", \"Baking With Julia,\" and \"Julia and Jacques Cooking at Home\" with Jacques Pépin. The kitchen was fully transformed into a functional set, with TV-quality lighting, three cameras positioned to catch all angles in the room, and a massive center island with a gas stovetop on one side and an electric stovetop on the other, but leaving the rest of the Childs' appliances alone, including the \"wall oven with its squeaking door.\" During taping, the kitchen table and chairs were removed and replaced by a cooking island that had a built-in stovetop and food preparation surfaces. This kitchen backdrop hosted nearly all of Child's 1990s television series.\n\nIn August 2001, representatives of the Smithsonian Institution met with Child in her home, where she agreed to donate her kitchen to the Institution, where it is now on display. Shortly after Child's 90th birthday, on August 18 and 19, 2002, Child attended the opening of the display of her kitchen. Her iconic copper pots and pans were on display at Copia in Napa, California, until August 2009 when they were reunited with her kitchen at the National Museum of American History.\n"}

After earning a master's degree in public administration from the Fluminense Federal University, she served as a city councillor of the Municipal Chamber of Rio de Janeiro for the Socialism and Liberty Party (PSOL) from January 2017 until her death.\n\nOn 14 March 2018, while in a car after delivering a speech, Franco and her driver were shot multiple times and killed by two murderers in another vehicle, North in Rio de Janeiro. Franco had been an outspoken critic of police brutality and extrajudicial killings, as well as the February 2018 federal intervention by Brazilian president Michel Temer in the state of Rio de Janeiro which resulted in the deployment of the army in police operations.\n\nFranco was raised in Maré, a slum in northern Rio de Janeiro, where she also resided for most of her life, and started to work to contribute to the household income in 1990 when she was 11 years old. Marielle gave birth to her first and only child when she was 19 years old (in 1998). Franco raised her daughter without the father's help and worked as a pre-school teacher making minimum wage.\n\nIn 2000, she began her pre-university studies. Following the death of a friend from a stray bullet in 2000, Franco began working in human rights activism.\n\nIn 2002, she entered the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro on a scholarship and continued working and raising her daughter as she earned a degree in social sciences. She went on to earn a master's degree in public administration from the Fluminense Federal University. She wrote her master's thesis (titled \"UPP: The Reduction of the Favela to Three Letters\") on the law enforcement program to retake control of the city's favelas from gangs.\n\nBeginning in 2007, Franco worked for state representative Marcelo Freixo as a consultant, and she coordinated the state legislature's Committee for the Defense of Human Rights and Citizenship. She also worked for civil society organizations, including the Brazil Foundation and the Maré Center for Solidarity Studies and Action.\n\nIn 2016, Franco ran for a seat on the Rio de Janeiro city council in the municipal elections. As a black woman and single mother from the favelas, Franco positioned herself as a representative and defender of poor black women and people from the favelas. With over 46,500 votes, Franco was one of 51 people elected, receiving the fifth highest vote total out of more than 1,500 candidates.\n\nAs a city council member, Franco fought against gender violence, for reproductive rights, and for the rights of favela residents. She chaired the Women's Defense Commission and formed part of a four-person committee that monitored the federal intervention in Rio de Janeiro. Working with the Rio de Janeiro Lesbian Front, Franco presented a bill to create a day of lesbian visibility in Rio de Janeiro in August 2017, but the bill was defeated by a vote of 19-17.\n\nOn 13 March 2018, Franco spoke out on Twitter against the police violence in Rio de Janeiro: “Another homicide of a young man that could be credited to the police. Matheus Melo was leaving church when he was killed. How many others will have to die for this war to end?” ()\n\nThe next day, Franco attended a round-table discussion titled \"Black Youngsters Moving [Power] Structures\" (). Less than two hours after leaving the round-table, she and her driver, Anderson Pedro Gomes, were fatally shot by two men who were driving another car. The men fired nine shots at them, four of which struck Franco – three in the head and one in the neck. Franco's press officer was next to her in the back seat and survived with injuries.\n\nMarcelo Freixo, a Rio de Janeiro legislative assembly member from PSOL who came to the scene shortly after hearing of her killing, determined that the bullets had been directed at her in a clear execution. According to the Rio de Janeiro police, the direction of the nine shots supports the hypothesis that Franco was assassinated. The bullets that killed Franco are from a batch bought by the federal police in Brasília in 2006; Minister of Public Security Raul Jungmann later said that they were stolen from a post office storage facility in Paraíba, but the ministry subsequently retracted this explanation after the Post Office publicly denied it.\n\nThousands took to the streets in coordinated protests across Brazil, and both Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch condemned her killing.\n\nJournalist Glenn Greenwald, whose husband David Miranda was a fellow City Council member and close personal friend of Franco's, listed what he referred to as the \"most important subjects to cover\" regarding Franco's assassination stating:\n\nHer relentless and brave activism against the most lawless police battalions, her opposition to military intervention, and, most threateningly of all, her growing power as a black, gay woman from the favela seeking not to join Brazil’s power structure, but to subvert it.\n\nA digital art workshop was held in Nairobi, Kenya titled \"Portraits of Marielle: Creating Bridges between Kenya and Brazil\" with young Kenyan artists participating, and the artworks were displayed at the Museum Mare in Rio de Janeiro on 10 November 2018.\n\nAmnesty International included Franco's name in its campaign for those who wrote for human rights and lost their lives, while an update was made and an online tribute listed Franco among over 400 human rights advocates for women by the Association for Women's Rights in Development.\n\nFranco identified as bisexual. In 2017, she moved to the Rio de Janeiro neighbourhood of Tijuca with her partner, Mônica Tereza Benício, and her 18-year-old daughter, Luyara Santos. Marielle and Mônica had met at a trip with friends when they were 18 and 24 years old, respectively. They had been dating for 13 years, although the relationship had often been interrupted due to the non-acceptance of their families and friends. In these times, Mônica had relationships with other women and men and Marielle with other men. Franco and Benício had been planning to marry in September 2019.\n\n"}

Kenneth Burke, who is largely credited for defining the notion of modern rhetoric, described modern rhetoric as, \"Rooted in an essential function of language itself, a function that is wholly realistic, and is continually born anew; the use of language as a symbolic means of inducing cooperation in beings that by nature respond to symbols.\" Burke’s theory of rhetoric directed attention to the division between classical and modern rhetoric. The intervention of outside academic movements, such as structuralism, semiotics, and critical theory, made important contributions to a modern sense of rhetorical studies.\n\nSome critics disagree with a changing definition of rhetoric, including Brian Vickers, who argued that modern rhetoric demeans classical rhetoric: \"It first reduces its scope, and then applies it to purposes that it never dreamt of.\" He also critiques Burke’s writing on modern rhetoric, saying it is, \"A [rhetorical] system that rearranges the components of classical rhetoric so idiosyncratically as to be virtually unusable.\"\n\nA significant event, deemed the \"linguistic turn,\" drastically changed how modern rhetoric was theorized and practiced. The linguistic turn linked different areas of study by their common concern for symbol-systems in shaping the way humans interpret the world and create meaning. Interpreting the world and creating meaning is the basis for Richard E. Vatz's \"Myth of the Rhetorical Situation,\" Philosophy and Rhetoric, Summer: 1973 and The Only Authentic Book of Persuasion, Kendall Hunt, 2012, 2013. This is a change from the traditional understanding of words being labels for ideas and concepts, to the notion of language constituting social reality.\n\nThe public sphere was studied by scholars such as Jürgen Habermas and Gerard A. Hauser. Jürgen Habermas described the public sphere as the sphere of private people coming together as a public that is accessible by all, to openly discuss the general rules governing society. Gerard Hauser described the public sphere differently in terms of rhetoric. Hauser explained it to be formed by the dialogue surrounding issues, emphasizing how the members of society that engage in the dialogue were the components of the public sphere. The public sphere grows by attaining more members who will engage in the vernacular. Hauser’s definition of the rhetorical public sphere still shares the notion of open debate and accessibility, assuming that the participants are actively engaged in the discourse.\n\nSome scholars that support the notion of modern rhetoric offer normative models that differ from classical rhetoric. Modern rhetorical study, some say, should stress two-way communication based on mutual trust and understanding to improve the speaker’s ability to persuade. Acknowledging that all communication and symbols are rhetorical, scholars of the field also call for a continued expansion of the objects of study, in order to improve communicative practices and bring about more egalitarian speech.\n"}

{"id": "1348989", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1348989", "title": "Numbers (TV series)", "text": "Numbers (TV series)\n\nNumbers (stylized as NUMB3RS) is an American crime drama television series that ran on CBS from January 23, 2005, to March 12, 2010. The series was created by Nicolas Falacci and Cheryl Heuton, and follows FBI Special Agent Don Eppes (Rob Morrow) and his brother Charlie Eppes (David Krumholtz), a college mathematics professor and prodigy who helps Don solve crimes for the FBI. Brothers Ridley and Tony Scott produced \"Numbers\"; its production companies are the Scott brothers' Scott Free Productions and CBS Television Studios (originally Paramount Network Television, and later CBS Paramount Network Television).\n\nThe show focuses equally on the relationships among Don Eppes, his brother Charlie Eppes, and their father, Alan Eppes (Judd Hirsch), and on the brothers' efforts to fight crime, normally in Los Angeles. A typical episode begins with a crime, which is subsequently investigated by a team of FBI agents led by Don and mathematically modeled by Charlie, with the help of Larry Fleinhardt (Peter MacNicol) and Amita Ramanujan (Navi Rawat). The insights provided by Charlie's mathematics were always in some way crucial to solving the crime.\n\nOn May 18, 2010, CBS announced that \"Numbers\" had been canceled after six seasons.\n\nThe show revolved around three intersecting groups of characters: the FBI, scientists at the fictitious California Institute of Science (CalSci), and the Eppes family.\n\n\nTemporary characters on the show were often named after famous mathematicians. For example, in the episode \"In Plain Sight\" (season 2, episode 8), one of the criminals is named Rolle and Charlie's father mentions a meeting with a man named Robert Peterson.\n\nOpening: (Voice-over by David Krumholtz) We all use math every day. To predict weather…to tell time…to handle money. Math is more than formulas and equations. It’s logic; it’s rationality. It’s using your mind to solve the biggest mysteries we know.\n\nThe first season run of the show aired between January 23, 2005, and May 13, 2005, at 10:00 p.m. on Fridays. It sees the start of the working relationship between Los Angeles' FBI field office and Charlie Eppes. The main FBI agents are Charlie's brother, Don Eppes, and Terry Lake, as well as David Sinclair. Don and Charlie's father, Alan Eppes, provides emotional support for the pair, while Professor Larry Fleinhardt and doctoral student Amita Ramanujan provide mathematical support and insights to Charlie. Season One was a half-season, producing only 13 episodes. Sabrina Lloyd played Terry Lake, an agent, in this season; she was later replaced by Diane Farr, who played Megan Reeves.\n\nThe second season run of the show aired between September 23, 2005, and May 19, 2006, again at 10:00 p.m. on Fridays. Season Two sees several changes to Don's FBI team: Terry Lake is reassigned to Washington and two new members join Don and David Sinclair: Megan Reeves and Colby Granger. Charlie is challenged on one of his long-standing pieces of mathematical work and also starts work on a new theory, Cognitive Emergence Theory. Larry sells his home and assumes a nomadic lifestyle, while he becomes romantically involved with Megan. Amita receives an offer for an assistant professor position at Harvard University, but is plagued by doubt as her relationship with Charlie is challenged and her career is in upheaval. Alan begins work and dating again, although he struggles with the loss of his wife, and both he and Charlie dream of her.\n\n\"Numb3rs\" was renewed for a third season, which began airing at 10:00 p.m. on Friday, September 22, 2006, and ended on May 18, 2007. Charlie and Amita intensify their relationship, as do Larry and Megan, especially after Megan's kidnapping. Amita has troubles adjusting in her new role as a CalSci professor, and Larry announces his leave of absence—he will be on the International Space Station for six months, which greatly distresses Charlie. Charlie and his colleagues are troubled by Dr. Mildred Finch, the newly appointed Chair of the CalSci Physics, Mathematics, and Astronomy Division, whom they learn has begun dating Alan. Meanwhile, Don dates Agent Liz Warner and questions his ethics and self-worth, and receives counseling. Charlie sees Don's therapist and the two understand one another more. Despite Don's concerns, Alan engages in some FBI consulting with his knowledge of engineering, and Larry returns from the space station, disillusioned. The finale wraps up with a revelation that Colby was actually a double agent for the Chinese.\n\nNoticeable changes from previous seasons include the removal of the opening credit sequence (credits are now done during the first segment of the show), the absence of Peter MacNicol's character for much of the season, and the absence of Diane Farr's character for a few episodes. Peter MacNicol appeared in the first eleven episodes before leaving for the television show \"24\", but returned to \"Numbers\" for the 21st episode of season 3 (\"The Art of Reckoning\"). His character's absence was written into the show by having him become a Payload Specialist on the International Space Station. Diane Farr, pregnant for most of the season, left the show for maternity leave in episode 18 (\"Democracy\"); her character's absence is explained as a special assignment to the Department of Justice.\n\nThe season premiere aired on September 28, 2007, in the same time slot as in previous seasons, 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time. Because of the writer's strike, only 12 episodes were initially produced. However, once the strike ended, CBS announced the show's return April 4, 2008, with six episodes. The season ended on May 16, 2008.\n\nAs this season starts, Colby Granger escapes from jail, and is revealed to be a triple agent. He then rejoins the team. Don and Liz break up halfway through this season, after Liz has trouble with Don's trust issues. Amita's parents come to visit, which becomes a secondary theme throughout most of the season. Due to her work at the D.O.J., Megan is conflicted by her work, and turns to Larry for help. Near the end of the season, Don's girlfriend from season 2, Robin Brooks, returns. Don and Robin then continue their relationship. Charlie attends FBI training camp because he has been working with Don for several years and wants to better understand what his brother does. In the season finale, Megan leaves the team to move back to Washington, D.C., and Charlie goes head-to-head with Don about a case. This causes Charlie to send information to scientists in Pakistan. He is subsequently arrested and has his security clearance revoked, so he can no longer help Don on cases. At the end of the episode, Don drives away to another case and Charlie admits that giving up FBI work will be harder than he expected.\n\nSeveral characters from previous seasons did not appear in season 4, most notably Mildred Finch and Ian Edgerton.\n\nThe fifth season premiered on October 3, 2008, and the season finale aired on May 15, 2009. The season premiere was moved back one week to accommodate the 2008 presidential debates.\n\nSeason five opens three weeks after \"When Worlds Collide\" (season four's season finale), with the government dropping the charges against Charlie. Charlie gets his security clearance back after he and Don fight FBI Security Officer Carl McGowan. Don begins to explore Judaism. The team adds new agent Nikki Betancourt, who arrives shortly after Megan Reeves' departure. Robin is offered a promotion but turns it down. Buck Winters (from the episodes, \"Spree\" and \"Two Daughters\") breaks out of prison and comes after Don. Alan suddenly finds himself coaching CalSci's basketball team. David becomes Don's primary relief supervisor. DARPA tries to recruit Charlie, but he turns down their offer. Toward the end of the season, Don is stabbed, and Charlie blames himself for it. The aftermath of Don's stabbing causes Charlie to focus more on his FBI consultation work. Amita is kidnapped, and the team races to find her. After she is rescued, Charlie proposes to Amita. Her response is left unidentified.\n\nNotes about Season Five:\n\"Disturbed\" marked the 100th episode of \"Numbers\".\n\nThe sixth and final season premiered Friday, September 25, 2009, at 10:00 p.m. EDT and the season finale aired on March 12, 2010, 3 days before Hirsch's 75th birthday.\n\nThe season starts with the engagement of Charlie and Amita. Soon after, Larry turns down an opportunity to meet with mathematicians at CERN, in Geneva, and drops his course load for the following semester. This leads Charlie to realize Larry is once again leaving, and leaving all of his work to Charlie. Don learns that his former mentor is crooked, causing Don angst when he has to shoot his mentor. Charlie and Don learn that Alan has lost a substantial amount of money in his 401(k). After some delay, Larry leaves Los Angeles, only to find a vacant piece of land for sale within driving distance of the city. Alan decides to return to work and finds a job as a software technical consultant. David asks Don for advice about career paths within the FBI. Larry returns from the desert with a new theory about the universe's fate. Charlie and Amita begin planning their wedding and decide to join the Big Brother/Big Sister program to practice parenting skills. They get married before their move to England to teach at the University of Cambridge. Don loses his gun, recovers it after it is used in some vigilante murders, and gets engaged to Robin. He also decides to leave the team, taking an administrative position within the FBI. Before leaving, Charlie and Amita decide that the family garage should be converted to a guest house so Alan can continue living with them. Leaving Colby, Liz, and Nikki behind, David departs for Washington, D.C., to take a position as an anti-corruption team leader.\n\nCBS DVD (Distributed by Paramount Home Entertainment) has released all six seasons of \"Numb3rs\" on DVD in Regions 1, 2 and 4.\n\nOn June 2, 2017, CBS DVD released \"Numb3rs: The Complete Series\" on DVD in Region 1.\n\nNicolas Falacci and Cheryl Heuton, the show's creators, have won several awards for the show, including the Carl Sagan Award for Public Understanding of Science in 2006, and the National Science Board's Public Service Award in 2007. Also, the show's stunt coordinator, Jim Vickers, was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Stunt Coordination in 2006 for episode 14 of Season 2, \"Harvest\".\n\nSeveral mathematicians work as consultants for each episode. Actual mathematics is presented in the show; the equations on the chalkboards are mathematically valid, and are somewhat applicable to the situations presented in each show. This mathematical validity and applicability of the equations has been asserted by professional mathematicians.\n\nA book entitled \"The Numbers Behind NUMB3RS: Solving Crime with Mathematics\" (; published August 28, 2007), written by Keith Devlin and Dr. Gary Lorden, a consultant to the show along with Dr. Orara, a physics consultant, explain some of the mathematical techniques that have been used both in actual FBI cases and in other law enforcement departments.\n\nSince the premiere season, the blog edited by Prof. Mark Bridger (Northeastern University) has commented on the mathematics behind each episode of the show.\n\nWolfram Research (the developers of \"Mathematica\") is the chief math consultant, reviewing scripts and providing background mathematics for the show. Starting with season four, their website in collaboration with CBS is entitled \"The math behind \"NUMB3RS\"\".\n\nOne part-time mathematician consultant to the show has expressed concern with its use of mathematics, asserting that the math is inserted after the initial script and written to provide plausible sounding jargon, rather than having consultants involved at all stages of story development. The same part-time consultant offered criticism of the show's portrayal of female mathematicians and expressed concern over the appropriateness of the relationship between Charlie Eppes and his graduate student Amita Ramanujan.\n\nThe idea for \"Numbers\" was generated in the late 1990s when Nick Falacci and Cheryl Heuton, the show's creators, attended a lecture given by Bill Nye, a popular science educator. The premise of the show is similar to that of author Colin Bruce's reimaginings of the Sherlock Holmes character, and to the \"Mathnet\" segment on the children's television show \"Square One\".\n\nGabriel Macht was originally cast to portray the character of Don Eppes. Also, the original concept for the show had the events take place at Massachusetts Institute of Technology; this was later changed to the fictional California Institute of Science, commonly called CalSci. Scenes which take place at CalSci are filmed at California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and the University of Southern California. One of the most frequent campus locations at Caltech is the vicinity of , including the bridge over Millikan Pond, the Trustees room, and the arcades of nearby buildings. At USC, locations include Doheny Library and the Town and Gown dining room. Exteriors for the FBI offices are on the distinctive bridge at Los Angeles Center Studios.\n\nAnother common location is the Craftsman home of the Eppes family. The house shown in the first season is real; it is owned by David Raposa and Edward Trosper, although a replica set was used from the second season onwards.\n\nThe show uses the number three in its title instead of the letter \"e\". In interviews with Tom Jicha of the \"South Florida Sun-Sentinel\" and with Alan Pergament of \"The Buffalo News\", Heuton mentioned that the use of the number three in the title derives from leet, a form of computer jargon that replaces letters with numbers. Dr. Gary Lorden, a California Institute of Technology mathematics professor who served as the show's mathematics consultant, told NPR's Ira Flatow that it was created on a normal computer keyboard. Lorden also mentioned that the use of the number three in the title can serve as a restriction in Internet searches about the series.\n\nBoth entertainment reporters and psychologists noticed the title's spelling. Some reporters, such as Joanne Ostrow of the \"Denver Post\", the staff members of \"People Magazine\", the editors of The Futon Critic, the staff of the Scripps Howard News Service, and Mike Hughes of \"USA Today\" acknowledged the presence of the number three in the title. Lynette Rice of \"Entertainment Weekly\" asked Krumholtz about the three in the title; his response was, \"Isn't that annoying? I think it should be the mathematical symbol for sigma, which looks like an E. I've been fighting that for weeks.\" (The sigma (∑) stands for summation.) Others used varying adjectives to describe the title. The TV site Zap2it.com called it \"their typographical silliness, not ours\". Brad Aspey of \"The Muskegon Chronicle\", stated, \"No, that wasn’t an ugly typo you just read - “NUMB3ERS” (pronounced numbers) is the idiosyncratic title of filmmakers Ridley and Tony Scott’s astute and crafty psychological drama which shows that even math can make for edge-of-your-seat entertainment.\" Ellen Gray of \"The Philadelphia Daily News\", said, \"Some of you may have noticed that in promoting \"Numb3rs,\" which premieres Sunday before moving to its regular 10 p.m. Friday slot, CBS has chosen to put a 3 in place of the \"e\" in the title….I won't be going along with this particular affectation, which slows down my typing and seems to be the graphic equivalent of the reversed \"R\" in Toys R Us. So there.\"\n\nStill others had a more positive view of the title. When NPR's Flatow asked both Lorden and Dr. Keith Devlin, NPR's mathematics reporter, about the title, both men denied creating the title; Devlin believed that executive producer Tony Scott originated the title. Lorden stated that he initially thought that the title was \"kind of hokey\" but later saw it as \"brilliant\" and a \"catchy logo\". Jonathan Storm of \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\", in his review of the series stated, \"You'd think CBS's new Numbers, which premieres at 10 tonight after the Patriots-Steelers football game, is just another one of those shows with numskull titles trying to draw attention to themselves. But the \"3\" substituting for the \"e\" is actually based on a real thing\"…. He later said that the show was \"written by people familiar with the Dead Cow Cult\". David Brooks of \"The Telegraph (Nashua, NH)\" devoted the majority of his entire review to the use of leet in the series title. In addition, three psychologists, Manuel Perea, Jon Andoni Duñabeitia, and Manuel Carreiras mentioned the television series in their 2008 article for the American Psychological Association's \"\".\n\nSeasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per episode) of \"Numb3rs\" on CBS.\n\n\"Note: Each U.S. network television season starts in late September and ends in late May, which coincides with the completion of May sweeps.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "887441", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=887441", "title": "PaRappa the Rapper 2", "text": "PaRappa the Rapper 2\n\nGameplay follows that of its predecessors, in which the player must press buttons to make Parappa rap in response to a teacher's lyrics. Players earn points and progress by rapping in time to the music and maintaining a Good rating through to the end of each level. By successfully improvising raps, the player can obtain a Cool rating, during which Parappa will be given the chance to rap freestyle by himself. If the player performs badly, however, they will drop down a rating to Bad and Awful, with the player losing if they drop below Awful or end the song with a Bad or Awful rating. \"PaRappa 2\" features some tweaks to the gameplay, as some of the teacher's lyrics may change based on the player's performance. For example, the lyrics may become simpler if the player is struggling, or become tougher if they perform well.\nAfter clearing two stages in a row, players can participate in a minigame where they must hit targets held out by Chop Chop Master Onion's Tamanegi students, earning bonus points which are added onto the previous level's score. Clearing each level with a Cool rating unlocks music tracks that can be listened to after completing the game. Each time the player clears the game, the color of Parappa's hat changes from blue, to pink, to yellow, with each hat remixing the lines in each level. In addition to the single player campaign, the game features a two-player Vs. Mode, in which players are given a line to rap to, which they must improve upon by freestyling better than their opponent.\n\nSimilar to \"Um Jammer Lammy\", the North American release of \"PaRappa the Rapper 2\" features some censorship when compared to the Japanese and PAL versions of the game, replacing lyrics referring to alcohol and religion in order to ensure an E rating from the ESRB.\n\nIn Japan, McDonald's released a demo disc alongside its Happy Meal, containing a demo of the first level modelled after a McDonald's restaurant, alongside a demo of \"Pipo Saru 2001\".\n\nParappa, having won a 100 years' supply of instant noodle products, has grown sick of eating nothing but noodles for every meal every single day. When Parappa complains about being served noodles by his crush, Sunny Funny, he becomes shocked when she calls him a baby, causing him to question his own maturity. When Parappa and his friend P.J. Berri go to eat at Beard Burger instead, they learn that a mysterious phenomenon is turning all the food in town into noodles. As Parappa and Sunny's respective fathers, Papa Parappa and General Potter, try to develop an invention that can stop the \"noodelization\", they inadvertently shrink themselves and everyone else in the process, but they are soon helped out by the Guru Ant and return to normal size. After undergoing army training under Instructor Moosesha, Parappa helps rescue a Hairdresser Octopus from being possessed into giving people afros, discovering \"Food Court\" a video game cartridge to be the cause. Upon reverse engineering the cartridge, Parappa and the others use sweets to combat against the Noodle Syndicate behind the town's noodlelization. They soon confront the mastermind, Colonel Noodle, who is revealed to be the son of Beard Burger Master who (similar to Parappa's situation) had grown sick of eating burgers all of his life, deciding that noodles should rule the world instead. However, Parappa manages to convince him to be more open-minded about different types of foods, and everyone celebrates with a party, where Sunny assures Parappa that he is more mature than he thinks himself to be. Things soon return to normal, only for Parappa to repeat his turmoil when he ends up winning another lifetime supply of cheese.\n\n\"PaRappa the Rapper 2\" is the original soundtrack from the game by the same name. The songs contain mildly explicit lyrics and cool moments.\n\nThe game received \"mixed to positive\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\n\nGameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann gave the game a 6.6, stating that \"an almost total lack of innovation makes the game seem pretty dated when compared with other games on the market. ... Even when played to perfection, though, the rapping still sounds just as stuttery as it did in the previous game. While it was excusable then and perhaps even a little charming, it would have been nice to see the developers make better use of the PlayStation 2's higher specs.\" Though the game \"features the same 2D graphical style as its predecessor, but it's not without its share of enhancements,\" he added, \"The music in the game covers a lot more ground, genre-wise, than the original did, but none of it is especially funny or toe-tapping--with the exception of the level that takes place inside an old video game machine. PaRappa 2 isn't a bad game, but it doesn't have as much of the same off-beat charm that the original--and to a lesser extent, Um Jammer Lammy--had.\" However, IGN's Douglass C. Perry gave the game a slightly better score of 7, saying, \"The game concept hasn't changed, leaning neither toward an evolutionary or even a moderate change in the way gamers play music games. ... [\"PaRappa 2\" is] not as hard as Um Jammer Lammy (which may be good for some folks), and it certainly covers familiar territory when it comes to the essentials -- gameplay, graphics, and sound -- but it's still fun and happy-making.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "777752", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=777752", "title": "Parasyte", "text": "Parasyte\n\n\"Parasyte\" centers on a male 17-year-old high school student named Shinichi Izumi, who lives with his mother and father in a quiet neighborhood in Tokyo, Japan. One night, strange worm-like creatures with drills as a 'head' called Parasytes appear on Earth, taking over the brains of human hosts by entering through their ears or noses. One Parasite attempts to crawl into Shinichi's nose while he sleeps, but fails as Shinichi wakes up, and enters his body by burrowing into his arm instead. In the Japanese version, it takes over his right hand and is named , after the Japanese word for 'right'; Tokyopop's 1990s English version, in which the images are flipped horizontally, has the Parasite take over Shinichi's left hand and it is named Lefty.\n\nBecause Shinichi was able to prevent Migi from travelling further up into his brain, both beings retain their separate intellect and personality. As the duo encounter other Parasites, they capitalize on their strange situation and gradually form a strong bond, working together to survive. This gives them an edge in battling other Parasites who frequently attack the pair upon realization that Shinichi's human brain is still intact. Shinichi feels compelled to fight other Parasites, who devour humans as food, while enlisting Migi's help.\n\nThe antagonists of the series. The Parasites are creatures of unknown origin which start off as worm-like creatures that instinctively enter the body of the nearest life form and travel to the brain to completely assimilate it while destroying the host's identity in the process. From there, using the vital organs of the host bodies to survive, the Parasites would be driven with a need to kill humans and Parasites with failed host bodies. After assimilating their host, Parasites exhibit a variety of abilities that make them dangerous adversaries: the immediate area around their entry site (typically the head) is morphed into a versatile \"parasite tissue\" which can take a variety of offensive and defensive forms, and a parasite that successfully takes over a host's brain can then maximize the physical potential of that host. In general, Parasite intelligence is comparable to humans, though their thought process is strictly rational and cold, with very little emotion. They are also capable of learning extremely quickly depending on their environment - Migi, for example, mastered Japanese after one night of reading books on the subject. While most Parasites initially acted alone, causing a chain of multiple grisly deaths coined the \"mincemeat murders\", they eventually form groups for safety in numbers. By the time of the final chapter, Shinichi speculating that they might have been created as an evolutionary countermeasure to humans, the surviving Parasites are assumed to have gone into hiding and adopt themselves further into human society to keep their activities to a minimum.\n\nIn the Tokyopop publication the main character's name was Shin and his hand was called \"Lefty\", as the image had been flipped to read left to right. Satomi Murano is Sara. Jaw, Uda's Parasite, is referred to as Jaws, in reference to the film \"Jaws\" by Steven Spielberg. Reiko is known as Tamara Rockford in the Tokyopop version. Gotō's name was written without a macron.\n\nIwaaki chose a high school setting due to a scene he had thought of. When considering a scene where Migi turns his shape into a penis in front of Satomi Murano, Iwaaki believed that the scene would work best in a high school setting, so Iwaaki gave \"Parasyte\" a high school setting.\n\n\"Parasyte\" was originally serialized in Japan in the \"Morning Open Zōkan\" from 1988 and switched to \"Afternoon\" after a few issues in 1990. It was collected into ten \"tankōbon\" volumes by Kodansha, and was later republished in eight \"kanzenban\" volumes. It was originally licensed for English translation and North American distribution by Tokyopop, which published the series over 12 volumes. The Tokyopop version ran in \"Mixxzine\". Daily pages from the Tokyopop version ran in the Japanimation Station, a service accessible to users of America Online. The Tokyopop English-language manga went out of print on May 2, 2005. Del Rey Manga later acquired the rights to the series, and published eight volumes following the \"kanzenban\" release. Kodansha Comics later republished the volumes in North America between 2011 and 2012.\n\nHollywood's New Line Cinema had acquired the film rights to \"Parasyte\" in 2005, and a film adaptation was reported to be in the works, with Jim Henson Studios and Don Murphy allegedly in charge of production. New Line Cinema's option expired in 2013, prompting a bidding war in Japan. Film studio and distributor Toho won the rights, and decided to adapt the manga into a two-part live-action film series directed by Takashi Yamazaki. The first part, \"\", was released in November 2014 and the second part, \"\", was released in April 2015.\n\nAn anime television series adaptation by Madhouse titled aired in Japan on NTV between October 9, 2014 and March 26, 2015. The series follows Shinichi Izumi, a high school boy whose right hand becomes possessed by an alien Parasite named Migi, finding himself in a battle against other Parasites who feast on other humans. The series was simulcast by Crunchyroll outside of Asia and by Animax Asia in Southeast Asia and South Asia. Sentai Filmworks has licensed the anime for North America, South America, United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand release. UK Distributor Animatsu Entertainment will release the series in the UK. In Australia and New Zealand, Hanabee has acquired the series and will release it within the region. The opening theme song is \"Let Me Hear\" performed by Fear, and loathing in Las Vegas. The ending theme is \"It's the Right Time\" performed by Daichi Miura. At Anime Expo 2015, Sentai Filmworks announced that the anime would run on Adult Swim's Toonami block on October 3, 2015. The English dub, provided and distributed by Sentai Filmworks, has been released on DVD and Blu-ray in two parts, with Part 1 (Episodes 1–12) on April 5, 2016 and Part 2 (Episodes 13–24) on July 5, 2016.\n\nThe series won the Kodansha Manga Award for general manga in 1993. It also won the Seiun Award for being the best manga of the year in 1996. The live action film \"Parasyte: Part 1\" had grossed around at the Japanese box office after two weeks.\n\nOn June 12, 2015, the Chinese Ministry of Culture listed \"Parasyte\" among 38 anime and manga titles banned in China.\n\n"}

Thus, the scope of the field covers the ancient folk literature of the Philippines' various ethnic groups, as well as various pieces of folklore that have evolved since the Philippines became a single ethno-political unit.\n\nWhile the difference between Philippine folk literature and Philippine mythology is a fine one, this article distinguishes folk literature as the source from which Philippine mythology derives.\n\nThis aims to revive the Spanish language and its influence in Filipino writing. Another proponent of Philippine literature is Valeriano Hernandez Peña, the Father of the Tagalog Novel (\"Ama ng Nobelang Tagalog\"). He authored the \"Magkaibigang Nena at Neneng\" in 1905. \n\nWhile the \"oral\", and thus \"changeable\", aspect of folk literature is an important defining characteristic, much of this oral tradition has been written into a print format. To point out that folklore in a written form can still be considered folklore, Utely points out that folklore \"may appear in print, but must not freeze into print.\" It should be pointed out that all the examples of folk literature cited in this article are taken from print, rather than oral sources.\n\nEugenio classifies Philippine Folk Literature into three major groups: Folk narratives, folk speech, and folk songs.\nFolk narratives can either be in prose - the \"alamat\" (folklore), the legend, and the \"kuwentong bayan\" (folktale) - or in verse, as in the case of the folk narrative. Folk speech includes the \"bugtong\" (riddle) and the \"salawikain\" (proverbs). Folk songs can be sub-classified into those that tell a story (folk ballads), which are rare in Philippine folk literature, and those that do not, which form the bulk of the Philippines' rich heritage of folk songs.\n\nSince it comes from a Southeast Asian nation, Philippine folk literature can be counted as a representative of Southeast Asian folklore. This is not a simple categorization, however, for two important reasons.\n\nFirst, Southeast Asia as a distinct cultural region was not recognized until the political environment after the Second World War.\n\nSecond, even as the idea of a Southeast Asia was being conceived, the inclusion of the Philippines in the region was consistently in debate because of its very different cultural makeup.\n\nSetting those two objections aside, Philippine folk literature would be considered a subset of the folklore of peninsular Southeast Asia, which includes the folklore of Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei. This would be distinct from the folk literature of continental Southeast Asia, which includes Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, and others. The distinction roots from the geographical influence on the cultures arising from these countries. \n\nLike all of Southeast Asia, however, whether peninsular or continental, Philippine folk literature shows strong cultural influences from India.\n\nA major difference however, arises from the colonial influences in the development of Southeast Asian folk literature. The Philippines' 300 years of Spanish rule makes it unique, enough to earn the title of \"a piece of Latin America in Southeast Asia.\"\n\nWhile folklore is often associated with ancient times, newer recordings of Philippine folk literature have made in modern times. Quite aside from urban legends, modern legends attributing superhuman powers to powerful and charistmatic leaders such as former presidents Ramon Magsaysay and Ferdinand Marcos have been documented and accepted as full-fledged examples of Philippine folk literature.\n\n"}
{"id": "15392729", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15392729", "title": "Postdevelopment theory", "text": "Postdevelopment theory\n\nPostdevelopment theory (also post-development or anti-development or development criticism) holds that the whole concept and practice of development is a reflection of Western-Northern hegemony over the rest of the world. Postdevelopment thought arose in the 1980s out of criticisms voiced against development projects and development theory, which justified them.\n\nThe postdevelopment critique holds that modern development theory is a creation of academia in tandem with an underlying political and economic ideology. The academic, political, and economic nature of development means it tends to be policy oriented, problem-driven, and therefore effective only in terms of and in relation to a particular, pre-existing social theory.\n\nThe actual development projects thus initiated, by both governments and NGOs, are directed in accordance with this development theory. Development theory itself, however, assumes a framework already set in place by government and political culture in order to implement it. The development process is therefore \"socially constructed\"; Western interests are guiding its direction and outcome, and so development itself fundamentally reflects the pattern of Western hegemony.\n\nDevelopment as an ideology and a social vision is ingrained in the ideals of modernization, which holds western economic structure and society as a universal model for others to follow and emulate. Rooted in western influence, the developmental discourse reflects the unequal power relations between the west and the rest of the world, whereby the western knowledge of development, approach toward development, and conception of what development entails, as well as perceptions of progress, directs the course for the rest of the world.\n\nInfluenced by Ivan Illich and other critics of colonialism and postcolonialism, a number of post-development theorists like Arturo Escobar and Gustavo Esteva have challenged the very meaning of development. According to them, the way we understand development is rooted in the earlier colonial discourse that depicts the North as \"advanced\" and \"progressive\", and the South as \"backward\", \"degenerate\" and \"primitive\".\n\nThey point out that a new way of thinking about development began in 1949 with President Harry Truman's declaration: \"The old imperialism—exploitation for foreign profit—has no place in our plans. What we envisage is a program of development based on the concepts of democratic fair dealings.\"\n\nWhile claiming that the \"era of development\" began at this point, post development theorists do not suggest that the concept of development was new. What \"was\" new was the definition of development in terms of an escape from underdevelopment. Since the latter referred to two-thirds of the world, this meant that most societies were made to see themselves as having fallen into the undignified condition of \"underdevelopment\", and thus to look outside of their own cultures for salvation.\n\nDevelopment, according to these critics, was now a euphemism for post-war American hegemony; it was the ideals and development programs of the United States and its (Western) European allies that would form the basis of development everywhere else.\n\nPost-development theory arose in the 1980s and 1990s through the works of scholars like Arturo Escobar, Gustavo Esteva, Majid Rahnema, Wolfgang Sachs, James Ferguson, Serge Latouche, and Gilbert Rist. Leading members of the post-development school argue that development was always unjust, never worked, and at this point has clearly failed. According to Wolfgang Sachs, a leading member of the post-development school, \"the idea of development stands like a ruin in the intellectual landscape\" and \"it is time to dismantle this mental structure.\"\n\nTo cite an example of this \"mental structure\", development theorists point out how the concept of development has resulted in the hierarchy of developed and underdeveloped nations, where the developed nations are seen as more advanced and superior to the underdeveloped nations that are conceived as inferior, in need of help from the developed nations, and desiring to be like the developed nations. The post-development school of thought points out that the models of development are often ethnocentric (in this case Eurocentric), universalist, and based on western models of industrialization that are unsustainable in this world of limited resources and ineffective for their ignorance of the local, cultural and historical contexts of the peoples to which they are applied. In essence, the problem post-development theorists see in development and its practice is an imbalance of influence or domination by the west. Post development theorists promote more pluralism in ideas about development.\n\nAmong the starting points and basic assumptions of post-development thought is the idea that a middle-class, Western lifestyle and all that goes with it (which might include the nuclear family, mass consumption, living in suburbia and extensive private space), may neither be a realistic nor a desirable goal for the majority of the world's population. In this sense, development is seen as requiring the loss, or indeed the deliberate extermination (ethnocide) of indigenous culture or other psychologically and environmentally rich and rewarding modes of life. As a result, formerly satisfactory ways of life become dissatisfying because development changes people's perception of themselves.\n\nMajid Rahnema cites Helena Norberg-Hodge: \"To take an example, Helena Norberg-Hodge mentions how the notion of poverty hardly existed in Ladakh when she visited that country for the first time in 1975. Today she says, it has become part of the language. When visiting an outlying village some eight years ago, Helena asked a young Ladakhi where were the poorest houses. 'We have no poor houses in our village,' was the proud reply. Recently Helena saw the same Ladakhi talking to an American tourist and overheard him say, 'if only you could do something for us, we are so poor.'\"\n\nDevelopment is seen as a set of knowledges, interventions and worldviews (in short, discourses) which are also powers: to intervene, to transform and to rule. Post-development critiques challenge the notion of a single path to development and demands acknowledgment of diversity of cultural perspectives and priorities.\n\nFor example, the politics of defining and satisfying needs is a crucial dimension of development thought, deeply entwined in the concept of agency. But who voices development concerns, what power relations are played out, how do the interests of development \"experts\" (the World Bank, IMF officials, professionals, and so on) rule the development priorities, and which voices are excluded as a result? The post-development approach attempts to overcome the inequality of this discourse by opening up spaces for non-Western peoples and their concerns.\n\nPostdevelopment theory is, above all, a critique of the standard assumptions about progress: who possesses the key to it and how it may be implemented.\n\nWhile the postdevelopment school provides a plethora of development critiques, it also considers alternative methods for bringing about positive change. The postdevelopment school proposes a particular vision of society removed from the discourse of development, modernity, politics, cultural and economic influences from the west, and market oriented and centralized authoritarian societies.\n\nIn his works, Escobar has outlined the common features of post-development thought and societal vision. According to Escobar, the post-development school of thought is interested (in terms of searching for an alternative to development) in \"local culture and knowledge; a critical stance toward established scientific discourses; and the defense and promotion of localized, pluralistic grassroots movements.\" Grassroots movements, Escobar argues, are \"local, pluralistic, and distrust organized politics and development establishment.\" (Escobar, 2017)\n\nPost-development thought takes inspiration from vernacular societies, the informal sector and frugal rather than materialistic lifestyles. Furthermore, post-development theorists advocate for structural changes. According to Escobar, post-developmental thinking believes that the economy must be based around solidarity and reciprocity; policy must focus on direct democracy; and knowledge systems should be traditional, or at least a hybrid of modern and traditional knowledge.\n\nOne of the leading anti-development writers, James Ferguson contributed to what John Rapley termed \"the most important of the opening salvos\" of post-development theory with his book \"The Anti-Politics Machine: Development, Depoliticization, and Bureaucratic Power in Lesotho\". In \"The Anti-Politics Machine\" Ferguson describes the failure of the development project to properly understand the cultural and economic values of the people of Lesotho. This misunderstanding led to misappropriation of resources by the international community and myriad negative consequences for Basotho (residents of Lesotho), prompting Ferguson to comment that \"Capitalist interests [...] can only operate through a set of social and cultural structures so complex that the outcome may be only a baroque and unrecognizable transformation of the original intention.\" Development projects cannot simply create a desired result, but instead have a number of unexpected consequences.\n\nFerguson suggests that although development projects often end in failure, they still produce tangible impacts in the physical and social-political environment. In \"The Anti-Politics Machine\", he asks, \"What do aid programs do besides fail to help poor people?\" In the case of Lesotho, Ferguson proposes that, \"while the project did not transform livestock-keeping it did build a road to link to Thaba-Tsea more strongly with the capital.\" Ferguson argues that there is value to understanding and thinking about the unintended consequences for an environment.\n\nCritics of development do not deny the need for change. They argue instead that to enact proper and effective change, change itself must first be conceived in different terms. Arturo Escobar, another leading member of the post-development school, argues:\n\nWhile social change has probably always been part of the human experience, it was only within the European modernity that 'society', i.e. the whole way of life of a people, was open to empirical analysis and made the subject of planned change. And while communities in the Third World may find that there is a need for some sort of organised or directed change—in part to reverse the damage done by development—this undoubtedly will not take the form of 'designing life' or social engineering. In this long run, this means that categories and meanings have to be redefined; through their innovative political practice, new social movements of various kinds are already embarked on this process of redefining the social, and knowledge itself.\n\nMajid Rahnema addresses the question of which path to take directly in his conclusion to the \"Post-Development Reader\". Rahnema admits that it may be true that a large majority of people, whose lives are in fact difficult, do want change. But the answer he suggests is not development but the \"end of development\". He says that the end of development is not \"An end to the search for new possibilities of change, for a relational world of friendship, or for genuine processes of regeneration able to give birth to new forms of solidarity\". Rather, Rahnema argues, the \"inhumane and the ultimately destructive approach to change is over. It should resemble a call to the 'good people' everywhere to think and work together.\"\n\nSerge Latouche is a French emeritus professor in economy at the University of Paris-Sud. A specialist in North-South economic and cultural relations, and in social sciences epistemology, he has developed a critical theory towards economic orthodoxy. He denounces economism, utilitarianism in social sciences, consumer society and the notion of sustainable development. He particularly criticizes the notions of economic efficiency and economic rationalism. He is one of the thinkers and most renowned partisans of the degrowth theory. Latouche has also published in the Revue de Mauss, a French anti-utilitarian journal.\n\nWolfgang Sachs is a leading writer in post-development thought. Most of his writing is focused on environmentally sustainable development and the idea that past notions of development are naturally unsustainable practices on our finite planet. However, in 1992 he co-authored and edited \"The Development Dictionary: A Guide to Knowledge as Power\" which contributed greatly to the compilation of post development literature as a general theory.\n\nThis manifesto posits that the new era of development that emerged in the 1950s was created by the United States in order to secure its new hegemonic position in the global community. Sachs explains that the concept of \"underdevelopment\" was actually constructed in Harry S. Truman's 1949 inaugural address, which popularized the term. Sachs argues that the creation of this term was a discrete, strategic move to secure American hegemony by reinforcing the idea that the United States is at the top, and other countries on a lower pillar, of a linear and singular trajectory of development. It created a homogeneous identity for these countries and stripped them of their own diverse characteristics. \"It converts participation into a manipulative trick to involve people in struggles for getting what the powerful want to impose on them.\"\n\n\"The Development Dictionary\" describes a biological metaphor for development. This biological metaphor was transferred to the social sphere and perpetuated the ideal that there is one natural way to develop into the perfect form. To develop in a manner disparate from the \"natural order of things\" was to become a disfigured anomaly. This definition held the potential to provide morally ambiguous justification for imperialist behavior and can be connected to colonial discourse and mainstream development theories. Under such categorization, Sachs explains, development was reduced to a simple measurement of the economic growth of per capita production.\n\nSachs issues a cry for public awareness of the \"limits of development.\" He leaves the reader with the idea of the \"New Commons\" and posits that men and women should begin with this awareness before attempting to introduce new political policies with room for creativity and innovation in diverse development paths.\n\nThere is a large body of works which are critical of post-development theory and its proponents. It has been noted that post-development theory sees all development as imposed upon the developing world by the West. This dualist perspective of development may be unrealistic, and Marc Edelman notes that a large proportion of development has risen from, rather than been imposed upon, the developing world. Citing Jonathan Crush's point that \"Development, for all its power to speak and to control the terms of speaking, has never been impervious to challenge and resistance, nor, in response, to reformulation and change\" Ray Kiely argues that \"The post-development idea is thus part of a long history within the development discourse.\" In short, Kiely argues that post-development theory is merely the latest version of a set of criticisms that have long been evident within writing and thought in the field of development. Development has always been about choices, Kiely explains. Choices with resulting losers and winners, dilemmas and destruction, as well as creative possibility.\n\nThere are a number of more fundamental objections to the postdevelopment school. The first is that it overstates its case. A rejection of \"all development\" is a rejection of the possibility for material advancement and transformation. It ignores the tangible transformations in life opportunities and health and material well-being that has been evident in parts of the developing world. Moreover, development itself is so varied and carries so many meanings that critiques need to be specific about their intention when they claim to be \"post- development\". By damning development all together, post-development theorists fail to notice the heterogeneity within development discourse. They categorize all development under the umbrella of Western hegemony, contradictively applying the same sort of essentialist generalization post-development theorists reject.\n\nCritics also argue that post-development perpetuates cultural relativism: the idea that cultural beliefs and practices can be judged only by those who practice them. By accepting all cultural behaviors and beliefs as valid and rejecting a universal standard for living and understanding life, critics of post-development argue, post-development represents the opposite extreme of universalism, extreme relativism. Such a relativist extreme, rather than besting extreme universalism, has equally dangerous implications. John Rapley points out that \"rejection of essentialism rests itself on an essentialist claim – namely, that all truth is constructed and arbitrary[...]\"\n\nKiely also argues that by rejecting a top-down, centralized approach to development and promoting development through local means, post-development thought perpetuates neo-liberal ideals. Kiely remarks that \"The argument — upheld by dependency and post-development theory — that the First World needs the Third World, and vice versa, rehearses neo-liberal assumptions that the world is an equal playing field in which all nation states have the capacity to compete equally[...]\" In other words, making locals responsible for their own predicament, post-development unintentionally agrees with neo-liberalist ideology that favors decentralized projects and ignores the possibility of assisting impoverished demographics, instead making the fallacious assumption that such demographics must succeed on their own initiative alone. Kiely notes that not all grassroots movements are progressive. Post-development is seen to empower anti-modern fundamentalists and traditionalists, who may hold non-progressive and oppressive values.\n\n\n"}

At its inception, the field focused on the economic history of agriculture. Since the 1980s it has become increasingly influenced by social history. It can be considered an equivalent of urban history.\n\nA number of academic journals and learned societies exist to promote rural history.\n\nRural history emerged as a distinct discipline from Agricultural history in the 1980s and was inspired by the French \"Annales\" school which favoured integrating economic, social and political history. Initially focused predominantly on the social history of rural life and later became increasingly interested in cultural history.\n\nIn Europe, the study of rural history is supported by the European Rural History Organisation (ERHO).\n\nBurchardt (2007) evaluates the state of English rural history and focuses on an \"orthodox\" school dealing chiefly with the economic history of agriculture. The orthodox historians made \"impressive progress\" in quantifying and explaining the growth of output and productivity since the agricultural revolution. A challenge came from a dissident tradition that looked chiefly at the negative social costs of agricultural progress, especially enclosure. In the late 20th century there arose a new school, associated with the journal \"Rural History\". Led by Alun Howkins, it links rural Britain to a wider social history. Burchardt calls for a new countryside history, paying more attention to the cultural and representational aspects that shaped 20th-century rural life.\n\nIn the U.S. most rural history has focused on the South—overwhelmingly rural until the 1950s—but there is a \"new rural history\" of the North as well. Instead of becoming agrarian capitalists, farmers held onto preindustrial capitalist values emphasizing family and community. Rural areas maintained population stability; kinship ties determined rural immigrant settlement and community structures; and the defeminization of farm work encouraged the rural version of the \"women's sphere.\" These findings strongly contrast with those in the old frontier history as well as those found in the new urban history.\n\nModernization came in the 20th century, with the arrival of mechanization, the model T, and the agricultural agent—as well as radio.\n\nRural history has been a major specialty of French scholars since the 1920s, thanks especially to the central role of the Annales School. Its journal \"Annales\" focuses attention on the synthesizing of historical patterns identified from social, economic, and cultural history, statistics, medical reports, family studies, and even psychoanalysis.\n\nA number of academic journals exist with a specific focus on rural history. These include:\n\n\n\n\n\nCurtis, D., 'Trends in rural social and economic history of the pre-industrial Low Countries: recent themes and ideas in journals and books of the past five years (2007-2013)', review essay in \"\" 128.3 (2013) 60-95.\n\n\n\n"}

The name \"sky lantern\" is a translation of the Chinese name but they have also been referred to as \"sky candles\" or \"fire balloons\".\n\nThe general design is a thin paper shell, which may be from about 30 cm to a couple of metres across, with an opening at the bottom. The opening is usually about 10 to 30 cm wide (even for the largest shells), and is surrounded by a stiff collar that serves to suspend the flame source and to keep it away from the walls.\n\nWhen lit, the flame heats the air inside the lantern, thus lowering its density and causing the lantern to rise into the air. The sky lantern is only airborne for as long as the flame stays alight, after which the lantern sinks back to the ground.\n\n\nAccording to the sinologist and historian of science Joseph Needham, the Chinese experimented with small hot air balloons for signaling from as early as the 3rd century BCE, during the Warring States period. Traditionally, however, their invention is attributed to the sage and military strategist Zhuge Liang (181–234 CE), whose reverent term of address was Kongming. He is said to have used a message written on a sky lantern to summon help on an occasion when he was surrounded by enemy troops. For this reason, they are still known in China as Kongming lanterns (, , \"kǒngmíng dēng\"). Another suggested origin is that the name actually comes from the lantern's resemblance to the hat Kongming is traditionally shown to be wearing.\n\nSky lanterns could be a possible explanation for some UFO sightings through the years.\n\nIn ancient China, sky lanterns were strategically used in wars, in a similar way as kites were used in ancient Chinese warfare, such as military communication (transmitting secret messages), signaling, surveillance or spying, lighting the sky when laying siege on the city at night etc. However, later on, non-military applications were employed as they became popular with children at festivals. These lanterns were subsequently incorporated into festivals like the Chinese Mid-Autumn and Lantern Festivals.\n\nTo represent the Star of Bethlehem during Christmas season, as part of celebrations sky lanterns are released into the night sky with hopes towards a new year.\nIn Bengal and Northeast India, Buddhist people celebrate their Probarona Purnima which signifies end of their three-month lent by releasing lighted sky lanterns (\"fanush\"), it is the second largest festival of the Buddhist community. During Diwali festival (The festival of Light) eco-friendly sky lanterns are used for celebrations along with fireworks.\n\nIn Brazil, sky lanterns (\"balão\" in Portuguese) were a traditional feature of the winter holidays (\"Festas Juninas\") at the end of June. It is claimed that custom was brought to Brazil from Portugal by colonists in the 16th century, and is still strong in Portugal, especially in Porto. The June holidays tradition also includes firecrackers and fireworks, another Chinese invention; so it is conjectured that these elements may have been brought from China by Portuguese explorers around 1500. The design and customs of Brazilian sky lanterns are modified to suit their festivals.\n\nBartolomeu de Gusmão, using a large scale version of these lanterns, was the first man to fly a hot air balloon in 8 August 1709, in the hall of the Casa da Índia in Lisbon, Portugal, long before the Montgolfier brothers.\n\nBrazilian sky lanterns are usually made by small groups of children and adolescents; but adults sometimes joined the effort, especially for the larger and more elaborate balloons. The launching of a large lantern, which could be one or two metres across, would usually require the cooperation of several people, to hold the balloon fully stretched until it was fully inflated. Lanterns with 20 meters or more and loaded with firecrackers and large flags are not uncommon. It is important to note that launching lanterns in Brazil is an environmental crime, punishable by up to 3 years in jail since 1998.\n\nPingxi District in New Taipei City of Taiwan holds an annual Lantern Festival in which sky lanterns are released into the night sky with people's wishes written, to send the wishes and messages to God. Lantern Festival is also as known as the 15th days of Lunar New Year, the last day of celebration for Lunar New Year.\n\nThe Lanna people of northern Thailand use \"floating lanterns\" (, \"khom loi\") year round, for celebrations and other special occasions. One very important festival in which sky lanterns are used is the Yi Peng festival, which is held on a full moon of the 2nd month (, \"Yi Peng\") of the Lanna calendar (which coincides with Loi Krathong, the traditional festival on the 12th month of the Thai lunar calendar). During the Yi Peng festival, a multitude of lanterns are launched into the air where they resemble large flocks of giant fluorescent jellyfish gracefully floating by through the sky. The most elaborate \"Yi Peng\" celebrations can be seen in Chiang Mai, the ancient capital of the former Lanna kingdom. The festival is meant as a time to obtain Buddhist merit (, \"tham bun\"). In recent times, floating lanterns have become so popular with all Thai people that they have become integrated into the festival in the rest of the country.\n\nIn addition, people will also decorate their houses, gardens and temples with intricately shaped paper lanterns (, \"khom fai\") of various forms. It is considered good luck to release a sky lantern, and many Thais believe they are symbolic of problems and worries floating away.\n\nA sky lantern may land when the flame is still alight, making it a fire hazard. In typical designs, as long as the lantern stays upright the paper will not get hot enough to ignite, but if the balloon is tilted (say, by the wind or by hitting some object), it may catch fire while still in the air. All the paper will usually burn in a few seconds, but the flame source may remain lit until it hits the ground.\n\nAfter the balloon lands, the leftover thin wire frame will rust away very slowly, remaining a hazard to animals that may swallow it. In 2009 British company Sky Orbs Chinese Lanterns developed lanterns with a bio-degradable fireproof rope in place of metal wire. Many other European manufacturers adopted similar designs. In 2012 the same company released a patented design with fireproof base following reports of fires caused by lanterns.\n\nSky lanterns have also been alleged to pose a danger to aircraft.\n\nOn 1 July 2013 the 'largest fire ever' in the West Midlands of England, involving 100,000 tonnes of recycling material and causing an estimated six million pounds worth of damage, was started by a sky lantern which landed at a plastics recycling plant in Smethwick. Images of the lantern starting the fire were captured on CCTV. In response to the fire, Poundland decided to stop selling sky lanterns and recalled their entire stock on 6 July 2013.\n\nIn 2018 a pavilion at Riocentro Convention Center, near downtown Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, fully burned after a sky balloon landed on its roof.\n\nDespite their use for centuries, there has been growing concern by some about the potential danger to cause crop or building fires and even harm animals that may eat their remains. Despite the general lack of prevalence some places have banned them for these reasons.\n\nThe city of Sanya in China banned sky lanterns due to their hazards toward aircraft and airspace navigation.\n\nIt is illegal to launch a sky lantern in most parts of Germany; where use is not illegal, as in Herford, it is necessary to obtain advance permission from local authorities. In Austria, it is illegal to produce, sell, import, or distribute them. In Argentina, Chile, and Colombia it is illegal to launch lanterns, as well as in Spain and Vietnam. In Brazil launching lanterns is an environmental crime, punishable by up to 3 years in jail since 1998.\n\nRetail sale (but not possession and use) of sky lanterns that \"rely on an open flame to heat the air inside the lantern\" was banned in Australia on 1 February 2011.\n\nSky Lanterns have also been banned in Kittitas County, Washington due to fire concerns on 20 June 2013. Since then, Washington state has banned sky lanterns statewide.\n\n\n"}

The dates and the frequencies of these services\nvary widely depending on the region of Japan. Suitable occasions may for example be 33 and 50 years after death.\n\nA special belief connected with \"sorei\" is the notion that the memorial\nservices result in the ancestral spirit successively losing its individuality,\neventually becoming an entirely deindividualized part of the collective of\n\"sorei\". However, depending on the region people\nmay think that these services are merely aimed at properly disposing or\npacifying the ancestral spirit.\n\nThe folklorist Yanagita Kunio has asserted that the rituals and\nideas around \"sorei\" could be fitted into a general scheme whereby\nancestors become not only protectors, but \"kami\" or \"ujigami\".\nHowever, while it is possible that in the distant past such a development with\nregard to certain ancestors has occurred, according to other scholars that\ncannot be proven. Contemporary Japanese may, \nin relation to their recently dead, not think about the ancient notion of \n\"ujigami\" at all, but they do have a notion about the spirits of the dead becoming\nsome sort of enlightened being. Indeed, another word for the departed soul is\nin Japanese \"hotoke\", which also means Buddha. \n\n"}
{"id": "23943388", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23943388", "title": "Sundance Institute", "text": "Sundance Institute\n\nSundance Institute is a non-profit organization founded by Robert Redford committed to the growth of independent artists. The Institute is driven by its programs that discover and support independent filmmakers, theatre artists and composers from all over the world. At the core of the programs is the goal to introduce audiences to the artists' new work, aided by the Institute's Labs, granting and mentorship programs that take place throughout the year in the United States and internationally.\n\nThe Institute has offices in Park City, Los Angeles, and New York City, and provides creative and financial support to emerging and aspiring filmmakers, directors, producers, film composers, screenwriters, playwrights and theatre artists through a series of Labs and fellowships. The programs of Sundance Institute include the Sundance Film Festival, a notable and critically acclaimed film festival in the U.S. that serves as a platform for independent filmmakers, storytellers and composers.\n\nThe Sundance Institute's founding staff, assembled in the spring of 1980, included Executive Director Sterling Van Wagenen, Director of Film Development Programs Jenny Walz Selby, and Director of Development Jon Lear. Frank Daniel was secured as Artistic Director. This staff produced the first Filmmakers Lab in June 1981, which fortuitously followed the at which \"Ordinary People\" (the directorial debut of Robert Redford) won numerous awards, including Best Picture. Michelle Satter joined the staff in June 1981 and subsequently opened up the Los Angeles office of the Institute.\n\nThe Sundance Institute's 1981 founding Board of Trustees included Robert Redford, Sterling VanWagenen, Robert E. Gipson, Ian Calderon, Robert Geller, George White, Irving Azoff, Saul Bass, Ian Cumming, Frank Daniel, Christopher Dodd, Moctesuma Esparza, Dr. Robert Gray, Alan Jacobs, Karl Malden, Mary McFadden, Mike Medavoy, Victor Nunez, Wayne Owens, Sydney Pollack, Gilbert Shelton, Annick Smith, Anthony Thomopoulos, Claire Townsend, and Robert Townsend. The first six listed were also members of the executive committee.\n\nIn 1985, the Sundance Institute assumed management of the fledgling United States Film Festival, which had been experiencing financial problems. The Institute hired Tony Safford from the AFI Kennedy Center program as Managing Director and renamed the festival.\n\nThe Institute started off with its Feature Film Program and Film Music Program (revived later in 1994) in the 1980s, then went on to include other programs such as the Native American and Indigenous Film Program in 1994, the Theatre Program in 1997, the Documentary Film Program in 2002, the New Frontier program in 2007, the Creative Producing Initiative in 2008, the Episodic Storytelling Initiative in 2014, Sundance Ignite, a program for young filmmakers, in 2015, and the Creative Distribution Initiative (an extension of the Creative Producing Initiative) in 2017.\n\nAt the U.S. Film Festival, after Sundance Institute took over in 1985, there were 85 films shown at two theatres in Park City with a staff of 13. In January 2017 at the present-day Sundance Film Festival, 181 films were shown at nine Park City theatres with a staff of 224 and 71,600 attendees.\n\nFor three weeks each June in Sundance, Utah, Directors Lab Fellows rehearse, shoot and edit four to six scenes from their screenplays under the mentorship of accomplished directors, editors, cinematographers and actors who serve as Creative Advisors.\n\nIn addition to the creative support offered through Labs and workshops, Sundance Institute helps independent filmmakers complete their work through various grants and fellowships. Many of these opportunities are designated for filmmakers selected to participate in the Institute's Feature Film Program.\n\nThe Sundance Institute Composers Lab, held every summer at the Skywalker Sound studio in Marin County, California, aims to enhance the role of music in independent film.\n\nComposers Lab Alumni include Bijan Olia, Cindy O'Connor, Sergei Stern, Jackson Greenberg, Camilla Uboldi, Jesi Nelson, Adam Schoenberg, Rebecca Dale, Ryan Rumery, and Darryl Jones.\n\nComposers Lab Advisors in 2017 include Harry Gregson-Williams, Thomas Newman, James Howard, George Clinton, Miriam Cutler, Laura Karpman, Doreen Ringer-Ross, Christopher Beck, Todd Boekelheide, Dennis Leonard, Bob Edwards, Pete Horner, Malcolm Fife, Bonnie Wild, David Accord, Adam Smalley, Miguel Arteta, Robb Moss, Amir Bar-Lev, Toby Shimin and Jon Burlingame.\n\nThe Music Cafe is a night club venue for rock, singer-songwriters, folk, country, and hip hop on Main Street in Park City during the Sundance Film Festival. Music Cafe daytime programming, produced by ASCAP, has featured such artists as India.Arie, Peter Gabriel, The Black Eyed Peas, Suzanne Vega, Sweet Pea Atkinson, Was (Not Was) and many others.\n\nThe Native American and Indigenous Film Program facilitates the participation of Native and Indigenous artists in the Institute's artistic development programs and the Sundance Film Festival. To date, the Initiative has facilitated the participation of many Native artists into the Sundance Film Festival, the Independent Producers Conference, and the Institute's Feature Film Program. In 2008 the Initiative expanded its focus to include outreach to documentarians, theatre artists, and musicians seeking financial and creative support through the Sundance Institute Documentary Fund, the Theatre Program, and the Film Music Program. The Sundance Film Festival provides a world stage for compelling and innovative films by Native American and Indigenous filmmakers. The Festival also hosts the annual Native Forum, a program of panel discussions, filmmaker workshops, and networking events that provide opportunities for indigenous filmmakers to share their expertise and knowledge with each other and the larger independent film community. The Native American and Indigenous Program is supported by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, Surdna Foundation, Time Warner Foundation, Ford Foundation, Native Arts and Cultures Foundation, SAGindie, Comcast-NBCUniversal, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the Embassy of Australia, Indigenous Media Initiatives, Taika Waititi, The White Feather Foundation, Fenton Bailey and Billy Luther, and Pacific Islanders in Communications.\n\nFrom 1994 to 2004, the Film Festival presented Native films as part a dedicated screening category. The Festival began incorporating Native and Indigenous films into its official film program in 2005.\n\nOver the course of its history, the Sundance Film Festival has showcased a range of work by Native and Indigenous filmmakers including dramatic films like Sterlin Harjo's \"Four Sheets to the Wind\", Sherman Alexie's \"The Business of Fancydancing\", Chris Eyre's \"Smoke Signals\", Rachel Perkins' \"One Night the Moon\", and Willi White's \"Miye, Unkiye;\" documentaries such as Heather Rae's \"Trudell\", Tom Murray and Allan Collins' \"Dhakiyarr vs. the King\", and Merata Mita's \"Hotere;\" and short films like Gabriel Lopez-Shaw and Sherwin Bitsui's \"Chrysalis\", Taika Waititi's \"Two Cars, One Night,\" and Shane McSauby's \"Mino Bimaadiziwin\".\n\nThe Theatre Program, under the direction of Philip Himberg, supports the development of independent theatre. Lab Alumni and projects include Tanya Barfield's \"Blue Door\", Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas' \"The Light in the Piazza\", Lisa Kron's \"Well\", Jessica Hagedorn's \"Dogeaters\", Stew's \"Passing Strange\", Steven Sater and Duncan Sheik's \"Spring Awakening\", Moisés Kaufman's \"The Laramie Project,\" Doug Wright's \"I Am My Own Wife,\" Darko Tresnjak's \"A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder,\" and Lisa Kron and Jeanine Tesori's \"Fun Home.\"\n\nThe Theatre Labs take place at the Sundance Resort in Utah, other U.S. cities, and internationally. Projects rehearse every other day to give playwrights adequate time for rewrites. There is no physically controllable space, such as a 'black box.' Although lighting and scenic production values are not available, designers have sometimes participated as part of the development of the projects text. When a project is accepted into the Lab, it is assigned a Sundance dramaturg who, in collaboration with the Producing Artistic Director, will work with that project prior to the Theatre Lab residency period.\n\nThe Sundance Playwright's Retreat at Ucross, Wyoming is an eighteen-day writing colony where five playwrights and a composer convene each year and where a Sundance dramaturg can respond to work at an early stage of the creative process. Like the other two Labs, the Ucross Retreat includes both emerging and established artists.\n\nArtists are selected by invitation only.\n\nIn May 2016, Sundance Institute had its first Theatre Lab in the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region, in the Ourika Valley of Morocco.\n\nThe Sundance Documentary Film Program assists nonfiction filmmakers from around the world with a series of workshops in editing, storytelling, and scoring for documentary films as well as providing grants to nonfiction film projects through the Sundance Documentary Fund. The Sundance Institute Documentary Film Program provides year-round support to nonfiction contemporary-issue filmmakers internationally. The program encourages the exploration of innovative nonfiction storytelling, and promotes the exhibition of documentary films to a broader audience. It supports independent artists both domestically and internationally through the Sundance Documentary Fund, the Documentary Composers Laboratory and Edit and Story Laboratory, panels at the Filmmakers Lodge at the Sundance Film Festival and the Sundance Independent Producers Conference, and a variety of collaborative international documentary initiatives.\n\nThe Documentary Fund was established at Sundance Institute in 2002 with a gift from the Open Society Institute and is supported by a leadership grant from the Ford Foundation. \n\nDocumentary Fund grants are announced once a year. In 2016, the Institute awarded over $1 million to artists for their documentary projects and global nonfiction storytelling.\n\nLaunched in 2007, the New Frontier Labs and residency programs foster the works of boundary-pushing artists and technologists, marked by its central themes of innovation and unconventionalism. The New Frontier exhibition at Sundance Film Festival provides a curation of such works in the emerging field through the incorporation of fiction, non-fiction, and a mix of the two, to showcase transmedia storytelling, multimedia installations, performances and films.\n\nAt the 2017 Sundance Film Festival, the New Frontier lineup included the North American premiere of Jem Cohen's film \"Museum Hours\" and documentary \"World Without End (No Reported Incidents)\", live multimedia performances, virtual reality segments, and immersive installations, among other projects.\n\nDeveloped in 2008 as an initiative to support the next generation of independent producers, the Creative Producing Labs and fellowships is a 5-day long Lab that focuses on the producer as a whole. With the help of experienced advisors, Creative Producing Fellows have the chance to explore their own take on cinematic material and to equip themselves with the skills and experience necessary in the scripting and editing stages of a filmic piece. Past Creative Advisors include producers Anthony Bregman (\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\"), Heather Rae (\"Frozen River\"), Mary Jane Skalski (\"Mysterious Skin\"), Jay Van Hoy (\"American Honey\"), and more.\n\nRecent Creative Producing Fellows and their Feature Film works include Annie Silverstein's \"Bull\", Cesar Cervantes' \"Hot Clip\", Hannah Utt's \"Stupid Happy\", Nick Bentgen's \"Dey'Dey and his Brothers\", Gabriella Moses' \"Leche\", and Pippa Bianco's \"Share\".\n\nInitiated in 2014 as a result of the substantial growth of opportunities made present by the demand of more serial content for online and television platforms, the Episodic Storytelling Initiative gives writers the chance to refine their episodic-writing/producing skills. The Institute offers a year-round program of Episodic Story Labs for 10 writers (or co-writing teams) to work with accomplished showrunners, non-writing creative producers, and studio and network executives.\n\nAccording to the Institute's founder, Robert Redford, \"Sundance Institute has always worked to develop and support a next generation of independent artists. As more of those artists look to the opportunities in television and online platforms, it is only natural that we expand our labs to address the unique needs of serialized work.\"\n\nPartnered with Adobe's Project 1324 contest, Sundance Ignite launched in 2015 as a short film challenge for young filmmakers ages 18 to 24. The entrants can win the Ignite Ticket Package, which is an exclusive chance to see the newest films at the upcoming Sundance Film Festival, and the Ignite Fellows Program, a year-round Festival and industry experience. Sundance Ignite also puts on Ignite On Tour, a traveling component designed for the winners to engage with Institute staff and alumni.\n\nThe Sundance Ignite program is supported by Adobe Project 1324, S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications, the College of Visual Performing Arts at Syracuse University, and Chapman University.\n\nThe Creative Distribution Initiative (CDI), part of the Creative Producing Initiative, is the Institute's newest program inaugurated in 2017. Through online resources, workshops, and a network of organizations, CDI empowers filmmakers by teaching them the ever-changing ins and outs of what it takes to distribute and market independent film. For the Sundance Institute alumni, CDI also offers free consultations on Kickstarter campaigns. Their first release under this initiative was the 2017 film \"Columbus\".\n\nThe Institute maintains the Sundance Collection at UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles) to conserve and archive the history of independent film. Film preservation is an especially pressing need in independent cinema. Despite their historical, artistic and cultural value, good prints of far too many indie films – even some made within the past decade – no longer exist. Chemical decomposition, neglect, and the changing ownership of film libraries have caused these prints to disappear.\n\nTo create a living record of the history of independent film, Sundance Institute and UCLA Film and Television Archive initiated the Sundance Collection at UCLA in 1997, and with contributions from studios and distributors as well as hundreds of individual filmmakers, the Collection's holdings have grown to include over 300 film prints. The archive represents a diversity of work from the Sundance Film Festival as well as projects developed through the Sundance Labs. From features to documentaries to shorts, prints in the Collection include \"Sex, Lies, and Videotape\", \"Reservoir Dogs\", \"The Living End\", \"Smoke Signals\", \"Amores Perros\", \"Harlan County, USA\", \"Love & Basketball\", and \"Welcome to the Dollhouse\", among many other works that might otherwise no longer exist.\n\nThe Collection also provides a central resource for the study of independent film, containing a rare assemblage of material related to the history of independent cinema, including press kits and filmmaker interviews.\n\n"}

The play depicts two women biologists meeting for the first time, one near the end of her career and the other at the beginning. The older woman has earned fame for her work on the Grandmother hypothesis. The younger wants to present a radical new hypothesis to explain why human females menstruate while most mammals do not. The play deals with the workings of science and its impact on the personal lives of women scientists.\n\nThe play premiered in 2011 in Princeton, New Jersey at McCarter Theatre, and has since been produced in the Penguin Rep in New York, the Trinity Repertory Company in Rhode Island, the InterAct Theatre Company in Philadelphia, and Timeline Theatre Company in Chicago. It is currently being produced by Shakespeare & Company in Lenox, Massachusetts. Hennepin Theatre Trust In Minneapolis slated the play for a run March 10 through March 20, 2016 at New Century Theatre featuring Caroline Kaiser as Zelda Kahn.\nTheater J In Washington DC ran the play from February 15 to March 12, 2016. It was directed by Shirley Serotsky. The New Jewish Theatre in St. Louis, Missouri produced the play in February 2018. \n\nThe play draws on the work of scientist Margie Profet, who theorized that menstruation clears the body of toxins.\n"}

The title of the song, tune and narration of the misfortunes of the \"Shean Bhean bhocht\" remain a constant however, and this version, probably the best known, expresses confidence in the victory of the United Irishmen in the looming rebellion upon the arrival of French aid. \n\nW.

{"id": "5592778", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5592778", "title": "Traditional education", "text": "Traditional education\n\nTraditional education, also known as back-to-basics, conventional education or customary education, refers to long-established customs that society traditionally used in schools. Some forms of education reform promote the adoption of progressive education practices, a more holistic approach which focuses on individual students' needs and self-control. In the eyes of reformers, traditional teacher-centered methods focused on rote learning and memorization must be abandoned in favor of student-centered and task-based approaches to learning. However, many parents and conservative citizens are concerned with the maintenance of objective educational standards based on testing, which favors a more traditional approach.\n\nDepending on the context, the opposite of \"traditional education\" may be progressive education, modern education (the education approaches based on developmental psychology), or alternative education.\n\nThe definition of \"traditional education\" varies greatly with geography and by historical period.\n\nThe chief business of traditional education is to transmit to a next generation those skills, facts, and standards of moral and social conduct that adults consider to be necessary for the next generation's material and social success. As beneficiaries of this scheme, which educational progressivist John Dewey described as being \"imposed from above and from outside\", the students are expected to docilely and obediently receive and believe these fixed answers. Teachers are the instruments by which this knowledge is communicated and these standards of behavior are enforced.\n\nHistorically, the primary educational technique of traditional education was simple oral recitation: In a typical approach, students sat quietly at their places and listened to one student after another recite his or her lesson, until each had been called upon. The teacher's primary activity was assigning and listening to these recitations; students studied and memorized the assignments at home. A test or oral examination might be given at the end of a unit, and the process, which was called \"assignment-study-recitation-test\", was repeated. In addition to its overemphasis on verbal answers, reliance on rote memorization (memorization with no effort at understanding the meaning), and disconnected, unrelated assignments, it was also an extremely inefficient use of students' and teachers' time. This traditional approach also insisted that all students be taught the same materials at the same point; students that did not learn quickly enough failed, rather than being allowed to succeed at their natural speeds. This approach, which had been imported from Europe, dominated American education until the end of the 19th century, when the education reform movement imported progressive education techniques from Europe.\n\nTraditional education is associated with much stronger elements of coercion than seems acceptable now in most cultures. It has sometimes included: the use of corporal punishment to maintain classroom discipline or punish errors; inculcating the dominant religion and language; separating students according to gender, race, and social class , as well as teaching different subjects to girls and boys. In terms of curriculum there was and still is a high level of attention paid to time-honoured academic knowledge.\n\nIn the present it varies enormously from culture to culture, but still tends to be characterised by a much higher level of coercion than alternative education. Traditional schooling in Britain and its possessions and former colonies tends to follow the English Public School style of strictly enforced uniforms and a militaristic style of discipline. This can be contrasted with South African, US and Australian schools, which can have a much higher tolerance for spontaneous student-to-teacher communication.\n\n"}
{"id": "9592477", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9592477", "title": "UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage", "text": "UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage\n\nThe Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage is a treaty that was adopted on 2 November 2001 by the General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). The convention is intended to protect \"all traces of human existence having a cultural, historical or archaeological character\" which have been under water for over 100 years. This extends to the protection of shipwrecks, sunken cities, prehistoric art work, treasures that may be looted, sacrificial and burial sites, and old ports that cover the oceans' floors. The preservation of underwater cultural heritage is significant as it allows for the retelling of numerous historical events. As part of its duty to conduct scientific research and provide continuous education on the importance of underwater cultural heritage, UNESCO strives to maintain these sites for the enjoyment of current and future generations. The convention may provide a customary framework to help raise awareness and seek to combat the illegal looting and pirating occurring in waters worldwide. As an international body, member states of the convention agree to work towards the preservation of sunken cultural property within their jurisdiction and the high seas.\n\nAs an international body, UNESCO continues to work towards the preservation of cultural goods worldwide. Similar to cultural property, only physical goods that are bestowed to future generations may fall into the protection of cultural heritage. It is thus a form of inheritance that allows current and future generations to learn about significant historical events. Particular to the concept of heritage, international agreements exist under the Council of Europe such as the 1885 Convention on the Protection of Archaeological Heritage of Europe and the European Convention on the Protection of Archaeological Heritage. These bodies create broad legal protections around cultural heritage antiquities and sites that are specific to communities worldwide. The 1954 Hague Convention was truly the first international convention that attempted to discuss the protection of cultural heritage. In defining property that is considered 'important' and 'valuable' for the good of the people, the issue of protecting cultural property became noticeable to international parties. It was only in the 1972 UNESCO Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, that the term 'cultural heritage' was employed to define the cultural objects to be protected at an international level However, due to its expansive definition, the concept of cultural heritage was further revised in the 1992 European Convention on the Protection of Archaeological Heritage. They serve to assert the universal value of protecting cultural objects that make up the history and identity of nations.\n\nAlong with the 100-year limitation period, the 2001 UNESCO Convention included the phrase 'cultural, historical or archaeological character' as the qualifying concepts that define underwater cultural heritage. Because many objects of cultural heritage lose their significance when taken out of water, this convention seeks to ensure the preservation of sunken sites.\n\nThe official text of the convention sets out the obligations of the states parties in regards to the protection of underwater cultural heritage, defined in Article 1 as:\n\n\"all traces of human existence having a cultural, historical or archaeological character which have been partially or totally under water, periodically or continuously, for at least 100 years\"\n\nArticles 1–4 define the convention and its objectives, as well as its relation to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the law of salvage.\n\nArticles 5–12 define varying levels of obligations and procedures within the four maritime zones (Territorial Sea, Contiguous Zone, Exclusive Economic Zone, International Waters) defined by UNCLOS.\n\nArticles 13–21 define further obligations, such as seizing illicitly recovered underwater cultural heritage, cooperating with other states parties, and providing training in underwater archaeology.\n\nArticles 22–35 clarify a number of points relevant to the functional aspects of the convention, such as the creation of statutory bodies, the settlement of disputes between states parties, and modes of ratification.\n\nIn addition to the official text of the convention, an annex of 36 rules governs the practical aspects of activities directed at underwater cultural heritage. States parties are required to ensure that these rules are applied within their territorial sea and contiguous zone, and also that they are adhered to by all nationals and flag vessels.\n\nRules 1–8 define general principles. Key among these are the complete prohibition of the commercial exploitation of underwater cultural heritage and the principle that \"in situ\" preservation should always be considered as a first option. The rules also cover aspects such as project design, conservation, documentation, and reporting.\n\nSituated between admiralty/private maritime law, the law of the sea, and cultural heritage law, the legal framework of underwater cultural heritage law is robust. Admiralty law is a branch entrenched within private international law relating to the control of maritime practices between private entities. Activities that fall under the protection of admiralty law include marine operations, marine salvaging, shipping and receiving. Subject to the common law jurisdiction and handled within domestic court systems, the body of admiralty law seeks to protect the rights and interests of private parties, with respect to practices at sea. On a broader level, this law seeks to fulfill public policy objectives including the safety of life and property, while ensuring the protection of the global marine environments.\n\nThe public international law body of the law of the sea was established to manage inter-state relations regarding practices in international waters. This complex body of law has grown to develop its own principles, particular methods of enforcement and Tribunals. Its primary objective is to create a supportive legal framework to determine the rights and duties of states with respect to their use of the ocean.\n\nIn 1982, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) was developed to govern the deep-sea beds vis-à-vis increasing commercial exploitation of sunken objects. In light of the emergence of newly independent states, a need was created for an international legal body that would help protect underwater cultural goods, in waters used by many parties worldwide. Resulting from the third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III) between 1973 and 1982, the Convention has created many new regulations applicable to nation states. Once signed, the Convention had established two maritime zones with governing international regulations, affixed the maximum depth-level at sea at twelve miles, created specific regimes for international and archipelagic states, and introduced three new international institutions.\n\nThe 2001 UN Convention on the Protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage is a product of international agreement on the adequate conduct of member states at sea. Its legal framework stems from two distinct sections of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC), including article 149 and 303.\n\nArticle 149 of the LOSC provides that:\n\" All objects of an archaeological and historical nature found in the\nArea shall be preserved or disposed of for the benefit of mankind\nas a whole, particular regard being paid to the preferential rights\nof the State or country of origin, or the State of cultural origin, or\nthe State of historical and archaeological origin.\" \n\nArticle 303 of the LOSC states that:\n\"1. States have the duty to protect objects of an archaeological and\nhistorical nature found at sea and shall cooperate for this purpose.\n\n2. In order to control traffic on such objects, the coastal State\nmay, in applying article 33, presume that their removal from the\nseabed in the zone referred to in that article without its approval\nwould result in an infringement within its territory or territorial\nsea of the laws and regulations referred to in that article.\n\n3. Nothing in this article affects the rights of identifiable owners,\nthe law of salvage or other rules of admiralty, or laws or practices\nwith respect to cultural heritage.\n\n4. This article is without prejudice to other international\nagreements and rules of international law regarding the protection\nof objects of an archaeological and historical nature.\" \n\nTo ensure that member states abide by the regulations stipulated within the Convention, they are to further adopt the following;\n\n1 Each Party is to adopt domestic legislation that prohibits nationals and vessels from engaging in activities that would purposely interfere with the protection of underwater cultural heritage\n\n2 Each Party is to require that all nationals and vessels report any new discoveries to UNESCO and fellow member states that are considered to be a part of underwater cultural heritage located in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), the Continental shelf and Area\n\n3 Each Party is to take appropriate measures to prevent the dealing of objects considered to be underwater cultural heritage. This includes the illicit sale or exportation, as well as trade or seizing of the object found in their territory.\n\nA recorded 22 earthquakes between 320 and 1303 AD on the coast of Pharos in Egypt shook the city of Alexandria, which was home to Pharos Lighthouse. The effects of these earthquakes, and several more in the centuries that followed suggest that the large monument may have fallen into the sea, leaving massive blocks of stone awaiting the exploration mission led by archaeologist Jean-Yves Empereur in 1994. While many components of the old lighthouse are on display at the Kom el-Dikka museum in Alexandria, archaeologists suggest that around 500 pieces remain on the sea floor. Today, the Alexandria Lighthouse is among one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. \nOn July 19, 1545, the British Fleet known as the \"Mary Rose\" sunk to the bottom of the Portsmouth Harbour, in the United Kingdom. While its failures still remain a mystery, is estimated that at least 500 men were trapped in the ship, and only 35 of these escaped to safety In 1982, sixty million people watched as the vessel was lifted out of its resting place, with its 19,000 discovered objects still intact. Due to the preservation of this monument of underwater cultural heritage in the \"Mary Rose\" museum, the public can continue to enjoy the vessel and all of her artifacts.\n\nOff the coast of Sweden in 1628, the pride of the Swedish Navy, the \"Vasa\" sunk deep beneath the frigid waters of the Baltic Sea. Under the orders of King Gustavus II Adolphus, the immense vessel was built to support Swedish military campaigns during the Thirty Years' War, yet was toppled by swift winds at sea. The Vasa remained peacefully underwater until a team of archaeologists raised the wreck in 1961. Fortunately, the wreck and all of its belongings were salvaged, despite its lengthily time spent on the ocean floor. Today, the Swedish \"Vasa\" museum in Stockholm is an emblem of cultural heritage, dedicated to educating public citizens worldwide.\n\nIn 1985, two scientists discovered the \"RMS\" Titanic in the northern waters of the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada Within the wreck, 1,800 artifacts were found, deeming the discovery a very important contribution to the field of Underwater Cultural Heritage The \"Titanic\" has raised significant questions surrounding the remaining passengers, the value of the wreck and the items lost therein, as well as the impact of the accident The discovery of the ship, and other sunken wrecks, may have also raised questions about the legal framework of the UN Convention on the Protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage.\n\nAs early as the sixth century BC, as Rome gained control over the Greek colonies of Italy and aligned itself with the western states, it developed a fleet that would allow the state to become the most powerful naval entity. Due to the lawless waters along the eastern coasts of Italy, this area was prevalent in pirating. Modern scholars refer to this area as being \"inhabited by wild, uncivilized tribes, who were active marauders of the land and sea, and were constantly reinforced from the interior\". While many dispute the accounts of these events, the marauding nature of pirates may continue to remain true today. Although naval warfare has decreased in popularity, modern pirates are now turning to alternatives to attain their desired treasures.\n\nToday, it is estimated that three million undiscovered shipwrecks and ruins continue to lie at the bottom of the oceans. With the introduction and growing popularity of scuba-diving since the 1940s, the accessibility of such underwater cultural heritage sites are becoming easier to modern pirates in search of new treasure. Studies have already shown that as of 1974, all known shipwrecks off the coasts of Turkey have been exploited by underwater pirates. Additionally, Israeli archaeologists estimate that at least 60 per cent of cultural objects that once lay in wrecks and sites have now disappeared without any trace. Due to the sheer mass of the world's oceans and the inability to monitor all activity that takes place therein, pirates and underwater thieves continue to pose a significant threat to the preservation of cultural heritage and cultural property.\n\nIn 2006, the UNESCO convention was ratified by an additional state, Portugal, needing international protection for the looting of its underwater cultural heritage sites. At least six international treasure hunting organizations had established themselves off the coasts of Portugal to reap the benefits of the nation's coastline after new legislation had allowed for the sale of artifacts collected underwater during archaeological excavations in 1993. Due to this, physical goods may have been looted without proper care, damaging the cultural property that was left behind. Not only did Portugal face a loss of cultural goods, but also possible facts about its historical events. \n\nAbstaining from signing the 2001 UN Convention, the United States has stipulated that the term \"all traces of human existence\" is too broad, legally and as a mechanism tool for the protection of underwater cultural heritage for the preservation of future generations. A problem that may arise with the 100-year period is that the beginning of this period is not clearly identified in the Convention, nor in the LOSC \n\nA criticism of the LOSC Articles is that they are considered ambiguous and obscure in nature. Article 149 fails to specify the manner in which objects of an archaeological nature are to be preserved of and disposed, as well as which mechanisms should be instituted in their conservation so as to benefit all current and future generations \n\nWith the discovery of the Spanish galleon San José by the Colombian Government, and in an effort to claim the galleon with all its cargo, the Spanish Government tried to use the convention as a measure to stop Colombia from salvaging the ship. Article 13 recognises sovereign immunity over sunken warships, but Colombia is not a participating member of the convention. Separately, Colombia has called the galleon part of its submerged patrimony so it is constitutionally bound to protect and preserve the warship.\n\nAs of May 2018, the treaty has 60 states parties.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "359237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=359237", "title": "Vernacular literature", "text": "Vernacular literature\n\nVernacular literature is literature written in the vernacular—the speech of the \"common people\".\n\nIn the European tradition, this effectively means literature not written in Latin. In this context, vernacular literature appeared during the Middle Ages at different periods in the various countries; the earliest European vernacular literatures are Irish literature, Welsh literature, Anglo-Saxon literature and Gothic literature.\n\nThe Italian poet Dante Alighieri, in his \"De vulgari eloquentia\", was possibly the first European writer to argue cogently for the promotion of literature in the vernacular. Important early vernacular works include Dante's \"Divine Comedy\", Giovanni Boccaccio's \"Decameron\" (both in Italian), John Barbour's \"The Brus\" (in Scots), Geoffrey Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales\" (in Middle English) and Jacob van Maerlant's \"Spieghel Historiael\" (in Middle Dutch). Indeed, Dante's work actually contributed towards the creation of the Italian language.\n\nThe term is also applied to works not written in the standard and/or prestige language of their time and place. For example, many authors in Scotland, such as James Kelman and Edwin Morgan have used Scots, even though English is now the prestige language of publishing in Scotland. Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o writes in his native Gikuyu language though he previously wrote in English. Some authors have written in invented vernacular; examples of such novels include the futuristic literary novels \"A Clockwork Orange\" by Anthony Burgess and \"Boxy an Star\" by Daren King.\n\nBy extension, the term is also used to describe, for example, Chinese literature not written in classical Chinese and Indian literature after Sanskrit. In the Indian culture, traditionally religious or scholarly works were written in Prakrit, Tamil and Sanskrit. With the rise of the Bhakti movement from the 8th century on-wards, religious works began to be created in Kannada, and Telugu, and from the 12th Century onward in many other Indian languages throughout the different regions of India. For example, the Ramayana, one of Hinduism's sacred epics in Sanskrit, had vernacular versions such as \"Ramacharitamanasa\", a Hindi version of the Ramayana by the 16th century poet Tulsidas. In China, the New Culture Movement of the 1910s–20s promoted vernacular literature.\n\nIn the Philippines, the term means any written literature in a language other than Filipino (or Tagalog) or English. At present, it forms the second largest corpus of literature, following the literature in Tagalog. During the Spanish colonial era, when Filipino was not yet existing as a national lingua franca, literature in this type flourished. Aside from religious literature, such as the Passiong Mahal (the Passion of Our Lord), zarzuelas were also produced using the Philippine vernacular languages.\n\nIn terms of Arabic, vernacular literature refers to literature written in any of the dialects of Arabic as opposed to Classical Arabic or Modern Standard Arabic. Examples of literary figures who have written in the Egyptian dialect are Ahmed Fouad Negm, Muhammad Husayn Haykal and Salah Jahin, as well as a wave of modern writers.\nLeonardo Da vinci Used vernacular in his work .\n\n"}

Over the years, WANEP has succeeded in establishing strong national networks in every Member State of ECOWAS with over 550 member organisations across West Africa. WANEP places special focus on collaborative approaches to conflict prevention, and peacebuilding, working with diverse actors from civil society, governments, intergovernmental bodies, women groups and other partners in a bid to establish a platform for dialogue, experience sharing and learning, thereby complementing efforts at ensuring sustainable peace and development in West Africa and beyond.\n\nWANEP was founded by two distinguished Africans; Samuel Gbaydee Doe and Emmanuel Habuka Bombande. Sam Gbadyee Doe is a peacebuilding and development professional from Liberia. He began his academic career from the University of Liberia where he studied Economics with the intention of being a banker and later proceeded to the Eastern Mennonite University for his MA in conflict transformation and Bradford University in the U.K. for a PhD. It was at EMU that the dream for the establishment of WANEP began when his paths crossed with John Paul Lederach and Emmanuel Bombande.\n\nMr. Emmanuel Habuka Bombande is a Ghanaian National Peacebuilding Practitioner with proven expertise in conflict transformation, peacebuilding, and development. After his social science degree from the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology-Kumasi Ghana, Mr. Bombande proceeded to the Eastern Mennonite University, USA for a master's degree in Conflict Transformation. It was there he met Sam Doe leading to the birth of WANEP.\n\nThe story of WANEP cannot be completely told without mentioning the invaluable contributions of Professor John Paul Lederach especially during the formation and nurturing stages of the institution which he described as …”Beginning of a new era of peace, healing, reconciliation and hope in West Africa.” He was instrumental to bringing together and mentoring the two co-founders of WANEP.\n\nBased on Sam Doe's background in working with trauma during the Second Liberian Civil War, and in establishing youth dialogue organizations and Bombande’s efforts with Hizkias Assefa at the Nairobi Peace Initiative in resolving the Kokomba-Nanumba conflict in northern Ghana, WANEP focused on both lessening existing conflicts and preventing future outbreaks. By directing efforts toward grassroots efforts the organization helped local leaders and citizens resolve conflicts without outside intervention.\n\nSamuel Gbaydee Doe served as the executive director of WANEP from its formation in 1998 until 2004. In 2004, then director of programs, Emmanuel Bombande was appointed executive director. In 2015,Dr. Chukwuemeka Eze, formerly the Program Director\ntook over from Bombande as the Executive Director while Levinia Addae-Mensah is the Deputy Executive Director/Program Director.\n\nWANEP has a niche in training CSOs, government and other practitioners in peacebuilding and conflict prevention. This niche has worked well in supporting peace and averting conflict in many situations. WANEP implements programs to equip the youth, business owners, women, traditional leaders and state agencies with requisite skills in conflict prevention and supports them to find local solutions or interventions to their unique conflict situations.WANEP emphasizes ownership and bottom-up approach to peacebuilding practice which enables the National Networks to carry out interventions that reflect the peculiarities of human security issues in their various countries. The national networks represent the WANEP brand and work in member states while the Regional Secretariat engages at the strategic level with ECOWAS, AU, UN and other intergovernmental, governmental and non-governmental organizations.\n\nWANEP's key area of focus includes but not limited to the following;\n\nUnder the WIPNET program, WANEP facilitated the Liberian Women Mass action for Peace initiated by Liberian Women in 2003. The women peace activism’s intervention in Liberia under the WIPNET program, led to the eventual ceasefire in the Liberian war. The outcome of the Liberian peace process and the role of WIPNET have been acknowledged all over the world and led to the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Her Excellency Ellen Johnson and Lemay Gbowe (WANEP Liberia former Coordinator for the WIPNET program). The mass action for peace is credited with urging Charles Taylor’s government and the Liberians for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) into a ceasefire and leading to the end of the conflict. WANEP also facilitated the creation of ‘Peace Hut’ in Liberia to facilitate the reconciliation process and provide environment for victims to meet and reconcile with offenders. This concept was replicated in Cote d'Ivoire.\n\nPresident Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has cited WIPNET as being one of the key factors supporting women’s prominent role in peace building in Liberia.\nIn 2015, WANEP signed an MOU with the African Union Commission to provide support to the Commission’s Peace and Security Department in the implementation of the AU Peace and Security Architecture (APSA) including the gender mainstreaming of the architecture.\n\nThe work of WANEP in establishing an early warning system has been instrumental in helping to resolve multiple conflicts in early stages. In 2014 this effort was officially recognized by Cote d’Ivoire’s permanent representative to the United Nations Youssoufou Bamba in his official remarks at the Informal interactive Dialogue on the Responsibility to Protect: \"Fulfilling our collective responsibility: International assistance and the responsibility to protect,\", September 8, 2014.\n\nWANEP experience in peacebuilding has been sought for replication in East and Central Africa. The unique structure of WANEP contributed to WANEP’s choice as the Civil Society implementing partner for the operationalization of ECOWAS Early Warning Mechanism (ECOWARN).\n\nA cet égard, permettez-moi de relever le travail remarquable que fait la section ivoirienne de la West Africa Network for Peacebuilding, la WANEP-CI, qui a mis en place une système indépendant d'alerte précoce, notamment par la diffusion de rapports mensuels de la collection d'informations, relatives à la sécurité humaine, et qui vise bien entendu, à soutenir les actions de prévention des conflits, et de promotion de la paix en Côte d'ivoire.\n\nIn September 2013 WANEP was also recognized for their work with ECOWAS to promote peace education in selected secondary schools across the region. [These studies] will impart new ways of thinking and new way of viewing conflict thereby leading to building new structures and cultural practices in the society that deepens peaceful coexistence.\n\nECOWAS/WANEP relationship was the first example of civil society and intergovernmental partnership not only in West Africa but Africa generally. The partnership has been highlighted as the best practice of building alliances with CSOs in conflict prevention and is a referral point \n<www.wanep.org/resource page>\n\nThe organization works with several regional partners including the Economic Community of West African States, the African Union’s Economic, Social, and Cultural Council ECOSOCC, and the United Nations Economic and Social Council(ECOSOC). WANEP is also a member of the Peace and Security cluster of ECOSOCC representing West Africa, and is the West Africa Regional Representative of the Global Partnership for the Prevention of Armed Conflict (GPPAC)and the Focal Point for Africa CSOs on the AU-EU Joint Strategy (JAES).\n\nIn 2002, WANEP entered into a historic partnership with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in the implementation of a regional early warning and response system referred to as ECOWARN. In 2004, WANEP and ECOWAS signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) which has consistently been renewed. this inter-governmental structure acts as a regional early warning and response system. WANEP and ECOWAS partnership enables typically non-governmental organizations a path to Track 1 diplomacy efforts early on in conflicts.\n\nInspired by its desire to contribute and commit to the sustenance of peace during elections, WANEP in collaboration with United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is implementing a five-year project (2015 to 2019) tagged, “Mitigating Election Violence in West Africa through National Early Warning Systems (NEWS)” in target countries of West Africa namely, Burkina Faso, Cote d’Ivoire, Niger, Ghana and Sierra Leone. Through this project, WANEP set up and operationalized an Election Situation Room (ESR) during elections in those countries. WANEP also partnered with other key stakeholders to run ESR in countries such as Benin, The Gambia and Nigeria.\n\nWANEP is working in partnership with the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre (KAIPTC) in Accra, Ghana to run the West Africa Peacebuilding Institute (WAPI)\n\nWANEP Publications and Reports (www.wanep.org/resource page)\n"}
