{"id": "40713385", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40713385", "title": "AFS Intercultural Programs", "text": "AFS Intercultural Programs\n\nAFS Intercultural Programs (or AFS, originally the American Field Service) is an international youth exchange organization. It consists of over 50 independent, not-for-profit organizations, each with its own network of volunteers, professionally staffed offices, volunteer board of directors and website. , 12,578 students traveled abroad on an AFS cultural exchange program, between 99 countries. The U.S.-based partner, AFS-USA, sends more than 1,100 U.S. students abroad and places international students with more than 2,300 U.S. families each year. More than 424,000 people have gone abroad with AFS and over 100,000 former AFS students live in the U.S.\n\nWhen war broke out in 1914, the American Colony of Paris organized an \"ambulance\"—the French term for a temporary military hospital—just as it had done in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 when the \"American Ambulance\" had been under tents set up near the Paris home of its founder, the celebrated Paris-American dentist, Dr. Thomas W. Evans. The \"American Ambulance\" of 1914 took over the premises of the unfinished Lycée Pasteur in the suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine—and was run by the nearby American Hospital of Paris.\n\nThe volunteer drivers of 1914 found themselves behind the wheels of motorized, not horse-driven, vehicles: Model-Ts, purchased from the nearby Ford plant in Levallois-Perret.\n\nIn the fall of 1914, when the war front moved away from Paris, the American Ambulance set up an outpost in Juilly and sent out detached units of volunteer drivers to serve informally with the British and Belgian armies in the north. In early 1915, one of those drivers, A. Piatt Andrew, was appointed “Inspector of Ambulances” by Robert Bacon, head of the American Ambulance and one of Andrew's colleagues from the Taft Administration.\n\nThe newly appointed inspector toured the ambulance sections of Northern France and learned that the American volunteers were bored with so-called \"jitney work,\" transporting wounded soldiers from railheads to hospitals far back from the front lines. French army policy prohibited foreign nationals from traveling into battle zones.\n\nIn March 1915, Andrew met with Captain Aime Doumenc, head of the French Army Automobile Service and pleaded his case for the American volunteers. They desired above all, he said, \"to pick up the wounded from the front lines…, to look danger squarely in the face; in a word, to mingle with the soldiers of France and to share their fate!\" Doumenc agreed to give Andrew a trial. The success of Section Z was immediate and overwhelming, and by April 15, 1915, the French created American Ambulance Field Service operating under French Army command.\n\nThis marked the formal beginning of American Ambulance Field Service, three units of which made their mark during battles in northern France, the Champagne, Verdun and the Vosges.\n\nBy the summer of 1916, the Field Service severed its ties with the American Ambulance and moved its operations from cramped quarters in Neuilly to Paris, onto the spacious grounds of the Delessert château at 21 rue Raynouard in the Passy area of Paris. There, it grew rapidly over the next year, continuing to provide \"sanitary sections\" to the French Army, while also serving as a recruitment source of combat pilots for the newly formed Escadrille Lafayette, one of whose prime movers, Dr. Edmund L. Gros, was the Field Service’s in-house physician.\n\nWhen the United States entered the war in April 1917, the French Army successfully appealed to the Field Service for drivers for its military transport sections —and so, no longer limited to medical transport, the organization renamed itself the “American Field Service”, thus establishing today’s well-known acronym, “AFS”.\n\nBefore the AFS was absorbed into the much larger, federalized U.S. Army Ambulance Service, it had numbered more than 2500 volunteers, including some 800 drivers of French military transport trucks. It had actively recruited its drivers from the campuses of American colleges and universities, promoting morale by creating units with volunteers from the same schools. All financed their own uniforms and transportation to France where they worked under the same conditions as French ambulance drivers—with the same pay—and often found themselves serving under extremely dangerous missions on the Front. By the end of the war, some 127 men who had served with the AFS were killed and a notable number of individuals and units earned the Croix de Guerre and the Médaille de Guerre for their heroic actions as drivers.\n\nOther volunteer ambulance corps served the French Army as “foreign sanitary sections” during World War I. The first was Henry Harjes’ “Formation” units under the American Red Cross, followed by Richard Norton’s American Volunteer Motor-Ambulance Corps, organized in London under the St. John’s Ambulance (the British Red Cross). Later, both would merge —under the American Red Cross—as the “Norton-Harjes”. In the summer and fall of 1917, when all the volunteer ambulance services were invited to join the new U.S. Army Ambulance Service, Norton’s units simply disbanded, while Harjes’, under the American Red Cross, moved into Italy where they would subsequently serve under the USAAS.\n\nOnce the Americans entered the war, many drivers joined combat units, both French and American, serving as officers in a variety of assignments, notably in air force and artillery units. At the same time, a large percentage of volunteers signed up for the military, thenceforth members of USAAS units, but remaining identified with their AFS past—a past kept alive through the work of HQ, still at 21 rue Raynouard, where a Bulletin was published and where visiting ambulance drivers could find temporary lodgings and meals.\n\nThe young AFS drivers came from \"prominent families in the States,\" and had attended, or were still attending, one of almost a hundred prominent colleges or universities around the country. Also represented were a smaller group from America's professional class: doctors, lawyers, architects, painters, brokers, businessmen, poets and writers. This literate group produced many letters, diaries, journals, and even poetry. The AFS collected many of these writings into \"Friends of France\", published in 1916. The Service used this volume to recruit more volunteers to the \"gloriously exciting and grandly humanitarian\" work of an ambulancier on the Western Front.\n\nAlso published in 1916, \"Ambulance Number 10\", by Leslie Buswell, was composed of the author's letters back to the States. Buswell went on to assist Henry Sleeper in the AFS's recruiting and fundraising offices in Boston.\n\nOther literary \"ambulanciers\" brought their letters and journals and memoirs to American publishers in the coming years. William Yorke Stevenson produced \"To The Front in a Flivver\" in 1917, stayed on in France after militarization, and composed \"From \"Poilu\" to \"Yank\"\" in 1918. Robert Imbrie published \"Behind the Wheel of a War Ambulance\" in 1918, as did Julien Bryan with \"Ambulance 464: Encore des Blesses\"\n\nThe AFS recruits who joined the Service in late spring 1917, after Congress's declaration of war, were greeted by Piatt Andrew with a request: Would they forego ambulance driving for trucking supplies to the front? Eight hundred AFS recruits joined the camion service, including John Kautz, who published \"Trucking to the Trenches\" in 1918.\n\nAfter the war the Field Service produced three hefty volumes of writings from numerous AFS alumni, including excerpts from the previously published books above.\n\nFollowing the Great War, the AFS became sponsors for the French Fellowships—graduate student scholarships for study in France and in the US—which were ultimately administered by the Institute of International Education and were precedents for the Fulbright Foundation exchanges. AFS also created an association for its veterans, publishing a bulletin, organizing reunions and contributing a wing to house its memorabilia at the Museum of Franco-American Cooperation in Blérancourt, France.\n\nWhen World War II broke out, AFS reorganized its ambulance service, sending units first to France and then to the British Armies in North Africa, Italy, India-Burma and with the Free French for the final drive from southern France to Germany.\n\nIn September 1946, Stephen Galatti,\npresident of AFS, established the American Field Service International Scholarships. During the 1947–48 school year, the first students came from ten countries including Czechoslovakia, Estonia, France, Great Britain, Greece, Hungary, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway and Syria.\n\n, there are over 55 AFS organizations worldwide serving over 80 different countries, providing exchange opportunities for over 13,000 students and teachers annually.\n\nAFS is one of the largest volunteer-based organizations of its kind in the world with more than 440,000 volunteers worldwide and more than 5,000 in the U.S. Tens of thousands of volunteers and a small staff make the AFS program happen worldwide. AFS volunteers are both young and old, busy professionals and retirees, and students and teachers. AFS provides development and training opportunities for volunteers.\n\nAFS volunteers help in many areas including facilitating the AFS mission in the local community and schools by finding and interviewing students and families. Further involvement includes serving as a contact person for an AFS student, organizing fund raising events, and arranging activities for AFS students. As a volunteer-driven organization, AFS depends on donations of time to implement and monitor the delivery of programs.\n\nNotable exception in the AFS network is its presence in China. Here AFS offers an outbound long-term student exchange program since 1997 and an inbound program since 2001. These programs however, are run and administrated by the China Education Association for International Exchange (CEAIE), an organization focusing on teacher exchanges that was founded by the Chinese Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of Education.\n\nAFS is an international, voluntary, non-governmental, non-profit organization that provides intercultural learning opportunities to help people develop the knowledge, skills and understanding needed to create a more just and peaceful world.\n\n\n\nAFS-USA, Inc. (a.k.a., AFS-USA) is the AFS partner organisation in the United States and is a registered 501(c)(3). Approximately 1,100 participants go abroad with AFS-USA annually. Over 2,300 international AFS students from AFS-USA partner countries are hosted in the U.S. annually. AFS-USA is supported by a volunteer base of over 5,000. Students aged 15 – 18 may partake in AFS-USA programs, while Gap Programs are available for individuals over 18 years of age on a \"gap year\".\n\nPublic Diplomacy Initiatives at AFS-USA offer support for international students to study in the United States and for U.S. students to study abroad via full funded scholarships by grant-making foundations or by the Educational and Cultural Affairs Bureau of the U.S. Department of State.\n\nThe Congress Bundestag Youth Exchange Program (CBYX) was launched in 1983 by the U.S. Congress and the German Parliament. AFS currently provides 50 merit-based, full scholarships for U.S. students and 60 scholarships for German participants.\n\nThe National Security Language Initiative for Youth (NSLI-Y) program is part of a broader government-wide presidential initiative that prepares American citizens to be leaders in a global world. Now more than ever, it is important that Americans have the necessary linguistic skills and cultural knowledge to promote international dialogues, support American engagement abroad, and attain better understanding of global cultures and issues. NSLI-Y encourages a lifetime of language study and cultural understanding by providing more than 600 fully funded scholarships to American high school students.\n\nIn 2018, NSLI-Y offers academic scholarships to learn Arabic, Mandarin Chinese, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Persian (Tajiki), Russian, and Turkish through summer and year-long programs in China, Morocco, Oman, Jordan, India, Korea, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkey, Taiwan, Indonesia, and other countries around the world.\n\nThe Future Leaders Exchange (FLEX) program originated in the FREEDOM Support Act, which was sponsored by U.S. Senator Bill Bradley and was passed by Congress in 1992. FLEX provides full merit-based scholarships to students from the countries of the former Soviet Union.\n\nKennedy-Lugar Youth Exchange and Study (YES) was initiated by The Department of State in the aftermath of Sept. 11. It aims to build bridges of understanding between Americans and people in countries with significant Muslim populations.\n\nAFS-USA awards more than $3 million in financial aid and scholarships to students each year. More than 40% of AFS-USA participants receive some form of financial assistance each year either need-based, merit-based or both. A partial list of scholarships and financial aid:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1024688", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1024688", "title": "Andragogy", "text": "Andragogy\n\nAndragogy refers to methods and principles used in adult education. The word comes from the Greek ἀνδρ- \"andr-\", meaning \"man\", and ἀγωγός \"agogos\", meaning \"leader of\"; it literally means \"leading man\", whereas \"pedagogy\" literally means \"leading children\".\n\nTwo primary understandings of \"andragogy\" exist:\n\n\nInterpreted broadly throughout academic literature, the term also invites other definitions such as \"\"adult education practice\", \"desirable values\", \"specific teaching methods\", \"reflections\", and \"academic discipline\"\", with many authors claiming it to be better than traditional adult education.\n\nThe term has been used by some to allow discussion of contrast between self-directed and self-taught education.\n\nThe term was originally coined by German educator Alexander Kapp in 1833. Andragogy was developed into a theory of adult education by Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy. It later became very popular in the US by the American educator Malcolm Knowles. Knowles asserted that andragogy (Greek: \"man-leading\") should be distinguished from the more commonly used term \"pedagogy\" (Greek: \"child-leading\").\n\nKnowles collected ideas about a theory of adult education from the end of World War II until he was introduced to the term \"andragogy\". In 1966, Knowles met Dusan Savicevic in Boston. Savicevic was the one who shared the term andragogy with Knowles and explained how it was used in the European context. In 1967, Knowles made use of the term \"androgogy\" to explain his theory of adult education. Then after consulting with Merriam-Webster, he corrected the spelling of the term to \"andragogy\" and continued to make use of the term to explain his multiple ideas about adult learning.\n\nKnowles' theory can be stated with six assumptions related to the motivation of adult learning:\n\n\nIn most European countries, the Knowles discussion played at best, a marginal role. \"Andragogy\" was, from 1970 on, connected with emerging academic and professional institutions, publications, or programs, triggered by a similar growth of adult education in practice and theory as in the United States. \"Andragogy\" functioned here as a header for (places of) systematic reflections, parallel to other academic headers like \"biology\", \"medicine\", and \"physics\".\n\nExamples of this use of andragogy are the Yugoslavian (scholarly) journal for adult education, named \"Andragogija\" in 1969, and the Yugoslavian Society for Andragogy; at Palacky University in Olomouc (Czech republic) the \"Katedra sociologie a andragogiky\" (Sociology and Andragogy Department) was established in 1990. Also, Prague University has a \"Katedra Andragogiky\" (Andragogical Department); in 1993, Slovenia's \"Andragoski Center Republike Slovenije\" (Slovenian Republic Andragogy Center) was founded with the journal \"Andragoska Spoznanja\"; in 1995, Bamberg University (Germany) named a \"Lehrstuhl Andragogik\" (Androgogy Chair).\n\nOn this formal level \"above practice\" and specific approaches, the term \"andragogy\" could be used relating to all types of theories, for reflection, analysis, training, in person-oriented programs, or human resource development.\n\nAdult learning is based upon comprehension, organization and synthesis of knowledge rather than rote memory. There are seven Principles of Adult Learning:\n\n\nLearning styles are referred and made by how certain people learn, categorize, and process new content they are descriptors of common behavior patterns. Each person may have multiple preferred learning styles and these are preferences that have mild-strong inclinations. Keefe formally defines learning styles as \"characteristic cognitive, affective, and physiological factors that serve as relatively stable indicators of how learners perceive, interacts with, and respond to the learning environment\". The three primary learning styles are visual, auditory, and kinesthetic. Kolb suggests to educate adult learners around the experiential cycle that reaches all types of learners.\n\nIn the field of adult education during recent decades, a process of growth and differentiation emerged as a scholarly and scientific approach, andragogy. It refers to the academic discipline(s) within university programs that focus on the education of adults; andragogy exists today worldwide. The term refers to a new type of education which was not qualified by missions and visions, but by academic learning including: reflection, critique, and historical analyses.\n\nDusan Savicevic, who provided Knowles with the term andragogy, explicitly claims andragogy as a discipline, the subject of which is the study of education and learning of adults in all its forms of expression' (Savicevic, 1999, p. 97, similarly Henschke, 2003, Reischmann, 2003).\n\nRecent research has expanded andragogy into the online world, finding that using collaborative tools like a wiki can encourage learners to become more self-directed, thereby enriching the classroom environment. It gives scope to self-directed learners. Andragogy helps in designing and delivering the solution focused instructions to self-directed. The methods used by andragogy can be used in different educational environments (e.g. adolescent education).\n\nAndragologist\nAndragologists are those who practice and specialize in the field of andragogy. Andragologists have received a doctoral degree from an accredited university in Education (EdD) or a doctorate in Psychology (PsyD), or Philosophy (PhD) and focused their dissertation utilizing andragogy as a main component of their theoretical framework.\n\nHere are some of the main differences between pedagogy and andragogy:\nNeuroscientist and educator Eric Jensen's factors for optimal learning include:\n\n\nKnowles himself changed his position on whether andragogy really applied only to adults and came to believe that \"pedagogy-andragogy represents a continuum ranging from teacher-directed to student-directed learning and that both approaches are appropriate with children and adults, depending on the situation.\" Hanson (1996) argues that the difference in learning is not related to the age and stage of one's life, but instead related to individual characteristics and the differences in \"context, culture and power\" within different educational settings.\n\nIn another critique of Knowles' work, Knowles was not able to use one of his principles (Self-concept) with adult learners to the extent that he describes in his practices. In one course, Knowles appears to allow \"near total freedom in learner determination of objectives\" but still \"intended\" the students to choose from a list of 18 objectives on the syllabus. Self-concept can be critiqued not just from the instructor's point of view, but also from the student's point of view. Not all adult learners will know exactly what they want to learn in a course and may seek a more structured outline from an instructor. An instructor cannot assume that an adult will desire self-directed learning in every situation.\n\nJ.R. Kidd goes further by claiming that principles of learning have to be applied to lifelong development. He suggested that building a theory on adult learning would be meaningless, as there is no real basis for it. P. Jarvis even implies that andragogy would be more the result of an ideology than a scientific contribution to the comprehension of the learning processes. Knowles himself mentions that andragogy is a \"model of assumptions about learning or a conceptual framework that serves as a basis for an emergent theory.\" There appears to be a lack of research on whether this framework of teaching and learning principles is more relevant to adult learners or if it is just a set of good practices that could be used for both children and adult learners.\n\n\n\n"}

As the Khmers are dominant in Cambodia, it can be coined to anti-Cambodian sentiment and hatreds against Cambodians.\n\nHistorically, Southern part of Vietnam before was not under Vietnamese rule but under Khmer Empire's subject, however, following the Vietnamese invasion to the South, the gate to the South China Sea has eventually closed for Cambodia. During the time of Minh Mạng of Nguyễn Dynasty, Vietnam implied a policy as \"Hán di hữu ngạn\" 漢夷有限 (\"the Vietnamese and the barbarians must have clear borders\") when differentiating between Khmers and the Vietnamese. Emperor Minh Mạng, the son of Gia Long stated with regards to the Vietnamese forcing the ethnic minorities to follow Sino-Vietnamese customs that \"We must hope that their barbarian habits will be subconsciously dissipated, and that they will daily become more infected by Han [Sino-Vietnamese] customs.\"\n\nThere were numerous Vietnamese invasions and occupation of Cambodia, although it was rather short-lived.\n\nAfter the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia later, at 1979, overthrew the Khmer Rouge, Vietnamese troops stationed to Cambodia until 1989 to stabilize the country as well as helping Cambodians recover from war. Since then, the two countries relationship was positive, and the people from both countries welcomed each other.\n\nCurrently, with the recent anti-Vietnamese and pro-Chinese movement in Cambodia launched by Sam Rainsy and Cambodia's support for China in the South China Sea's conflict, Vietnamese have become more hostile towards Cambodia and Cambodian people, seeing Cambodians as ungrateful and traitors who do not remember the past.\n\nHatreds against Khmers began with the rise of Ayutthaya Kingdom. The Siamese had ransacked Angkor Wat and invaded Cambodia many times in the history. Notably, Siamese Prince and King Naresuan had launched a brutal invasion which ransacked entire of Cambodia and Khmers being forced to Siam as its slave labors. It became a cure which would be remembered as Siamese atrocities against Khmers.\n\nIn the later times, when Vietnam rose to become a fierce rival, Siam had fought against Vietnam. However, many of Siam's attempt mostly crossed through Cambodia, which they had raped, looted and enslaved many Khmers during its road of invading Vietnam, thus led to many hostilities and hatreds against Cambodians among Siamese.\n\nSince then, a numerous of disputes continued. In January 2003, riots broke out in Phnom Penh after a Cambodian newspaper incorrectly reported that a Thai actress had stated Angkor Wat properly belonged to Thailand. On 29 January, the Thai embassy was burned, and hundreds of Thai immigrants fled the country to avoid the violence. Cambodians in Phnom Penh burned photos of King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Thais in Bangkok protested in front of the Cambodian embassy, burning Cambodian flags. This eventually led to the Thai government to sever diplomatic ties with Cambodia. Prime Minister Hun Sen banned Thai shows and films on TV stations. Throughout 2008-13, Thai and Cambodian military forces did skirmish on each other over the Preah Vihear dispute, led to Cambodian–Thai border dispute. Later court's decision, which favored Cambodia, sparked angers among Thai citizens.\n\nMany Thais also see Cambodians as poor and uneducated, and there are even hatreds against Khmer immigrants.\n\nThe Philippines, which also has disputes with China, has been the major critics who criticized Cambodia for backing China. This led to some Filipinos believe Cambodia is a traitor of ASEAN and a puppet of China.\n\nHatreds against Cambodians mostly target on Khmer immigrants.\n\n"}

It was recommended by the regional Parliament of Serbia on August 17, 2004 and constitutionally adopted on November 8, 2006, after Serbia became a sovereign state again. The recommended text was made Law on May 11, 2009. The original song was written in 1872 with music by Davorin Jenko and lyrics by Jovan Đorđević. It was then a piece for the theater play \"Marko kazuje na kome je carstvo\" (Marko names the Emperor), and its immense popularity with audiences prompted its adoption as the Serbian national anthem.\n\nWhile being the national anthem of the Kingdom of Serbia, it occasionally was referred to as the \"Serbian National Prayer\" and the original lyrics contained a petition for the Serbian king. Various rulers of Serbia changed the words of the anthem to suit them. During the rule of Prince Milan I of Serbia, the words were \"God, save Prince Milan\" (\"knez Milana Bože spasi\"), which changed to \"King Milan\" when Serbia became a kingdom. Later it was tailored to Peter I and Alexander I as well. During the time of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (which later became the Kingdom of Yugoslavia), \"Bože pravde\" was part of its national anthem.\n\nThe current anthem uses slightly modified original lyrics, asserting that Serbia is no longer a monarchy — four verses are different. In three, \"Serbian king\" (\"srpskog kralja\") is changed to \"Serbian lands\" (\"srpske zemlje\") and in one, \"God save the Serbian king\" (\"srpskog kralja Bože spasi\", literally \"The Serbian king, O God, save\") is changed to \"O God, save; O God, defend\" (\"Bože spasi, Bože brani\").\n\nIt was also used as a state anthem of Republika Srpska, an entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina until 2006, when it was ruled down by the country's constitutional court. The Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina has ruled against the use of \"Bože pravde\" as the anthem of Republika Srpska in 2006, declaring it unconstitutional, and the decision was upheld by the Constitutional Court of Republika Srpska.\n\nIn 1992, \"Vostani Serbije\" and \"Marš na Drinu\" were proposed as the anthem of Serbia along with \"Bоže pravde\". The latter, promulgated by then-ruling Socialist Party of Serbia, even received a plurality of popular vote on referendum, but was never officially adopted.\n\nThe full Serbian national anthem officially has eight stanzas, but only the first two are usually sung.\n\n(*) Chorus sung twice\n\n"}

It is derived from the Spanish word \"campo\", for \"countryside\".\n\nThe Camp contains various small settlements, such as Fox Bay, Goose Green, Darwin, and Port Howard, which are usually little more than several houses. Port Louis in the north of East Falkland is the oldest permanent settlement in the islands, established by the French in 1764. Port Egmont on Saunders Island, now abandoned, is the oldest British settlement. The majority of the Camp population lives on East Falkland, followed by West Falkland. Outlying islands such as Pebble, Sea Lion, West Point, Weddell and Carcass Island are inhabited as well. Camp is used in formal contexts: e.g. the Falkland Islands Legislative Assembly has Stanley and Camp constituencies.\n\nThere are also some British military installations such as RAF Mount Pleasant, Mare Harbour, and Mount Alice, and there is also the Bodie Suspension Bridge, the southernmost of its kind in the world. Many parts are still landmined from the time of the Falklands War, particularly just outside Stanley.\n\nOfficially, the Falklands uses UTC-3 in the summer months (and since September 2010 has been on UTC-3 permanently) but many residents of Camp use UTC-4 all year round, known on the Falklands as \"Camp Time\". This caused confusion in 2009 when a team of Royal Engineers working in Hill Cove did not realise West Falkland was on a different time zone from Stanley.\n\nSheep farming is the main industry. Others include fishing, and tourism (particularly wildlife or war-related tours). The Camp is represented by three members of the Legislative Assembly of the Falkland Islands, currently Roger Edwards, Ian Hansen and Teslyn Barkman.\n\n"}

Its location is next to the British pavilion.\n\nThe Canada Pavilion is designed to remind guests of Canada's outdoors. It includes a canyon, a waterfall, gardens, a pool with fountains, and totem poles. The main attraction is \"O Canada!\", a Circle-Vision 360° movie of Canada's cities, scenery and people. The pavilion also includes Le Cellier Steakhouse and the former home of the Celtic rock band Off Kilter. Characters from the animated films \"Brother Bear\" (Koda, Rutt and Tuke) and \"Pocahontas\" (Meeko and Flit) can sometimes be seen.\n\nPrior to the construction of the pavilion, the Walt Disney Company sought financial support for the attraction from the Canadian government. The company wanted the federal government to fund the cost of building the attraction; in return the government would have input into the design and layout. The Canadian government was concerned about the stereotype of Canada that Disney wanted (i.e., lumberjacks). Funding was refused, and Disney threatened to pull the exhibit, but ultimately did not.\n\nAt one time during the planning, the pavilion was to have been divided by a main street of shops and restaurants, with one side representing French Canada and the other English Canada.\n\nAt the opening in 1982, the original musical talent for the Canadian pavilion was a trio called the \"Caledonian Pipe Band\", consisting of two pipers and one drummer. The performers were Robert (Bob) Proctor (lead, drummer), Kenneth Mauchin (piper) and Robert Mauchin (piper). They were recruited by Ron Rodriguez (talent co-ordinator for Walt Disney World) from the Rosie O'Grady's Pipe Band of Orlando. Because all three had ties to Scotland, they also performed in the British pavilion at various times.\n\nIn 2007, Disney updated the movie \"O Canada!\", filmed in 1979. For several years, the Canadian Tourism Commission lobbied to have the movie updated, partly to remove outdated stereotypes of Canadian life. On August 31, 2007, the updated edition opened with a new host, Canadian actor Martin Short, and \"Canadian Idol\" winner Eva Avila reprising the original film's theme song, \"Canada (You're a Lifetime Journey)\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pavilion has three native totem poles, up to 30' (9 metres) in height. Two are made of fibreglass, and one is carved out of wood. The wooden totem pole depicts three stories of the \"Raven\" tricking the \"Sky Chief\" into the release of sun, moon and stars from a chest. It was carved by the Alaskan artist David A. Boxley, and was officially put on display in April 1998.\n\nThe Victoria Gardens which are adjacent to the Hotel du Canada are inspired by the Butchart Gardens near Victoria, British Columbia. The gardens are the largest (and most labour-intensive) of all the national pavilions.\n\nThe Canada Pavilion contains three Hidden Mickeys:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8773037", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8773037", "title": "Candy Desk", "text": "Candy Desk\n\nThe Candy Desk has been a tradition of the United States Senate since 1968, whereby a senator who sits at a particular desk near a busy entrance keeps a drawer full of candy for members of the body. The current occupant of the Candy Desk is Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey.\n\nIn 1965, California's George Murphy joined the Senate, and kept candy in his desk to offer his colleagues, and for himself, though eating is not allowed on the Senate floor. When he left the Senate after a six-year term, other Republican senators maintained the custom. The nascent tradition did not become publicly known until the mid-1980s, when Washington Senator Slade Gorton disclosed it in announcing that he would be sitting at the Candy Desk.\n\nSenators who have maintained the Candy Desk tradition include John McCain, Harrison Schmitt, and Rick Santorum, who stocked it with confectionery from his home state of Pennsylvania, including from the Hershey Chocolate Company. After Santorum left the Senate in 2007, the Candy Desk was maintained by a number of senators for a short time each, before Pennsylvania Senator Toomey began his stay in 2015.\n\nGeorge Murphy was elected as the Senator from California in 1964, to take office the following year. Murphy, known as a song-and-dance man from musicals such as \"Broadway Melody of 1938\", \"Broadway Melody of 1940\" and \"For Me and My Gal\", had a taste for sweets. A short time after joining the Senate, he started keeping candy in his desk; then, in 1968, he moved desks and ended up at the spot where the Candy Desk is now situated. Since more senators now passed his desk on a daily basis, he started offering the contents of his desk to his colleagues. Senators who were invited to partake in the sweets started calling Murphy's desk the \"candy desk\". Murphy was defeated in the 1970 Senate elections, but subsequent senators have carried on the tradition of supplying candy in their desk for the enjoyment of the Senate as a whole.\n\nPaul Fannin, Harrison Schmitt, Roger Jepsen, and Steve Symms all continued the new candy desk tradition, in that order, after Murphy's one term was over. Fannin, Schmitt, and Jepsen supplied only hard candy, but Symms was the first to stock sweets supplied by \"candy and chocolate associations.\" During the tenures of these senators, the candy desk was not fixed to one particular spot. Senate seating charts show Schmitt, during his time with the candy desk, sat one seat to the right of its traditional spot for the 95th Congress, and then sat across the aisle from the traditional spot for the 96th.\n\nNone of the above was publicly known until 1985, when Slade Gorton put out a press release stating \"He was now the occupant of this desk and would carry on the rich traditions started by Murphy.\" He also named the past senators who had continued the tradition.\n\nIn 1997, the candy desk was referenced by Kit Bond during a debate over the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1998. He compared the sizes of microchips to candy he had taken from the desk.\n\nThe high point, in terms of well-known candy, came during the ten years Rick Santorum sat at the candy desk (1997–2007). Being a senator from Pennsylvania, he filled the candy desk with Hershey candy and Just Born products (such as Mike and Ike and Hot Tamales). During this time period, Hershey shipped roughly 100 pounds of chocolate and other candy four times a year for Santorum to fill the desk. When Santorum did not win re-election during the 2006 U.S. Senate elections, Kirk Saville, a spokesman for Hershey, said about the company's no longer being able to supply sweets for the candy desk, \"We were pleased to be a small part of sweetening up congressional proceedings.\"\n\nIssues arose after Santorum was defeated for re-election to the Senate in 2006, and Senator Craig Thomas began his tenure at the candy desk. Wyoming, the state he was representing, has no members of the National Confectioners Association, and therefore no candymakers large enough to donate hundreds of dollars of candy to fill the desk. Senate ethics rules \"forbid members accepting gifts worth $100 or more a year from a single source,\" which can become a problem if a large amount of candy is consumed from the desk each year. An exception to this rule allows larger gifts of objects created or produced in the state the senator is from, as long as the items are primarily not used by the senator and his staff. This is so senators can \"offer visitors home-grown snacks, such as Florida orange juice or Georgia peanuts.\" When asked about Thomas being in charge of the candy desk, Susan Smith, a representative from the National Confectioners Association, stated, \"We're happy to provide candy if there are [association] members...It would be difficult for us to do now.\" These issues were worked around by asking many small, local, Wyoming confectionery businesses and chocolatiers to give small amounts of candy that were rotated in and out of the desk.\n\nAfter Thomas's death in 2007, it was looked after by George Voinovich and then Mel Martinez. Both had relatively short tenures. In 2009, George LeMieux, Martinez's successor, began sitting at the desk and was there until he left the Senate in 2011. Mark Kirk of Illinois occupied the desk from 2011 to 2015.\n\nThe candy desk is not a specific desk in the Senate Chamber, but rather a specific seating within the chamber, and any desk that the senator seated in that position chooses to use becomes the candy desk. The desk's location has remained static since at least the 97th Congress (1981–1983). It is next to the eastern door to the senate chamber. Most senators enter the chamber through this door, which is adjacent to elevators leading to one of the stops on the United States Capitol subway system. The desk is the first desk on the right, or Republican, side, and is in the last row of desks. Traditionally, the candy desk is always on the Republican side of the Senate Chamber and is used by a Republican senator. Since 2015 the desk has been occupied by Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey.\nThe Democrats have also had a candy desk since at least 1985. A rolltop desk located on the front wall, belonging to the United States Senate Democratic Conference Secretary, is also filled with sweets. This tradition began \"sometime later\" than the better known candy desk; Hershey Kisses were the most popular candy from this desk during the 1980s, followed by small caramels. Candy for this desk is paid for through a \"candy fund\" to which senators who would like to partake of the desk's contents contribute. Until he left the Senate in 2015, Jay Rockefeller was responsible for collecting the money and purchasing the candy. This tradition is not widely known; in fact, it is so little-known that the Historian of the United States Senate does not know much about it.\n\nOther senators sometimes keep candy in their desks as well. Katherine Buck, a United States Senate Page at the time, wrote the following in 2005:\n\nOne senator with a particularly strong hankering for chocolate is Jim Talent from Missouri. Once during a vote, he called people away from the candy desk to his own on the other side of the row. There were oohs and aahs until six people walked away with Russell Stover Low-Carb Chocolates. (I guess the Atkins craze had made its way to the Senate.)\n"}

Roosevelt said the era of growth and unrestricted entrepreneurship had ended, and the individualism must give way to collective action. He was not at all specific, but he hinted at liberal reforms of the sort that emerged in The First Hundred Days after his inauguration in March 1933. Scholars rate it among the 100 greatest speeches made by a President in the 20th century.\n\nRoosevelt was long on history and short on specifics. He sketched a philosophical foundation for the New Deal, and ultimately for a Second Bill of Rights that he was committed to achieving over the course of his administration. Most historians consider it prophetic regarding the actual content of New Deal liberalism.\n\nThe great era of rapid economic growth had ended, Roosevelt argued. In the days when growth was all-important, he agreed that it had been necessary to turn political and economic power over to entrepreneurs who were building the nation. But the era of economic growth was over he said; the entrepreneurs are now dangerous:\n\nRoosevelt said that further growth was unnecessary: \"Our task now is not discovery or exploitation of natural resources, or necessarily producing more goods.\" What America instead needed to do:\n\nParts of his speech had a gloomy tone: \"A glance at the situation today only too clearly indicates that equality of opportunity as we have known it no longer exists.\" \"We are steering a steady course toward economic oligarchy, if we are not there already.\" However he did hint at reforms that would bring about a better world: \"Every man has a right to life; and this means that he has also a right to make a comfortable living.\"\n\nBiographer Frank Freidel emphasizes that Roosevelt wanted government to \"act as a regulator for the common good within the existing economic system.\" Roosevelt believed his philosophy was in accord with the traditions of Thomas Jefferson and Woodrow Wilson, as modified to deal with a much more complex and mature economic order.\n\nThe response to the speech by the 2000-member luncheon audience and by the national media was tepid. Some thought it too socialistic; others considered it too academic in tone, especially for its long passages on the lessons of American and European history. Roosevelt did not try to rework his material into simpler speeches. He moved on to other topics, and received a rousing reception to the more usual speech he gave that same evening.\n\nThe speech was written by Adolf A. Berle and his wife Beatrice, who worked on Roosevelt's campaign office.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18232390", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18232390", "title": "Danake", "text": "Danake\n\nThe danake or danace (Greek: ) was a small silver coin of the Persian Empire (Old Persian \"dânake\"), equivalent to the Greek obol and circulated among the eastern Greeks. Later it was used by the Greeks in other metals. The 2nd-century grammarian Julius Pollux gives the name as \"danikê\" or \"danakê\" or \"danikon\" and says that it was a Persian coin, but by Pollux's time this was an anachronism.\n\nThe term as used by archaeologists is vague in regard to denomination. A single coin buried with the dead and made of silver or gold is often referred to as a danake and presumed to be a form of Charon's obol. Numismatists have also found the danake an elusive coin to identify, speculating that the Greeks used the term loosely for a demonetized coin of foreign origin.\n\nIn Persia, the danake was originally a unit of weight for bulk silver, representing one-eighth of a shekel (1.05 gm). This use of the word became obsolete. In the Hellenistic period and later it designated the silver Attic obol, which originally represented the sixth part of a drachma; in New Persian \"dâng\" means \"one sixth\".\n\nThe danake is one of the coins that served as the so-called Charon's obol, which was placed on or in a dead person's mouth to pay the ferryman who conveyed souls across the river that divided the world of the living from the world of the dead. Charon's obol is sometimes specifically called a \"naulum\" (Greek , \"boat fare\"). The Christian-era lexicographer Hesychius gives \"the obol for the dead\" as one of the meanings of , and the Suda defines the danake as a coin traditionally buried with the dead for paying the ferryman to cross the Acheron. In literary sources, the smallness of the denomination was taken as a reminder that death is an equalizer of rich and poor.\n\nAlthough Charon's obol is usually regarded as Hellenic, archaeology indicates that the rite of placing of a coin in the mouth of the deceased was practiced also during Parthian and even Sasanian times in the region that is present-day Iran. The coin, however, was customarily a drachma. In his entry on the , Hesychius implies that the coin was mentioned by Heracleides of Cyme in his lost work \"Persica\" around 350 B.C., placing its use (perhaps erroneously) in the Achaemenid period.\n\nGold danakes are frequently found in graves. In a Thessalian burial of the 4th century B.C., a gold danake had been placed on the lips of a woman, presumed from her religious paraphernalia to be an initiate into the Orphic or Dionysiac mysteries. The coin was stamped with a Gorgon's head.\n\nIn archaeological investigations of Greece since the mid-1990s, danakes have tended to be found in cemeteries. At a necropolis at Hephaisteia on Lemnos, exploration of which began in 1995, the many finds in unlooted graves included a gold danake. In the late 1990s, a cemetery in northwest Greece yielded objects dating from the mid-4th to the early 3rd centuries B.C., including oinochoai, unguentaria, a wreath with thin gold leaves (sometimes associated with Orphic religion), a gold danake, and a silver obol with a winged Pegasus. A gold danake of Geta dating 199–200 A.D. was among objects — including potsherds, animal bones and shells, and bronze coins —retrieved from a well in the center of a cemetery in central Macedonia. The well was surrounded by a paved floor and housed by a stone structure. It is thought that the deposition followed funerary meals and offerings to the dead.\n\nIn investigations reported 2004–2005, a single gold danake was found along with bronze coins and glassware in an Achaian cemetery where both adults and children had been buried in wooden coffins. Graves in Euboia yielded pottery and glassware, small bone tools, iron strigils, and gold jewelry and danakes. In Epiros, graves and funerary chests yielded gold danakes along with kantharoi, lamps, pyxides, figurines, gold rings, gold oak leaves, iron strigils, a bone flute, fragments of funerary stelae and a marble head of a young man. The items dated from the 4th to the 2nd century B.C. Excavations at a Hellenistic cemetery in the same area uncovered five gold danakes along with seventeen perfume flasks, twenty-six vessels, a bronze strigil, an iron spearhead, terracotta figurines and a funerary pelike with \"gorgoneia\" at the base of the handles.\n\nThe word \"danake\" continued in use into the Middle Ages as Arabic \"daneq\", Persian \"dangh\" or \"daneh\", and post-classical Sanskrit \"tanka\". The name has been connected to the silver \"tangka\" of India, which had the same weight.\n\n"}

{"id": "22334559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22334559", "title": "Driekops Eiland", "text": "Driekops Eiland\n\nDriekops Eiland (also called Driekopseiland) is a rock engraving or petroglyph site in the bed of the Riet River close to the town of Plooysburg, near Kimberley, Northern Cape, South Africa.\n\nThere are more than 3500 individual engravings at this site, predominantly pecked geometric images, occur on glaciated basement rock exposed in the bed of the river and are submerged when the river rises. Archaeologists and geomorphologists have estimated that the engravings may have been made in two episodes – before about 2500 years ago and after about 1000 years ago.\n\nThe site has been at the centre of a number of debates about South African rock engravings.\n\nSensational claims about the site and makers of the engravings are advanced by Brenda Sullivan, Cyril Hromnik and others in books such as \"Spirit of the rocks\". The ideas set out by these authors, often involving ancient visitors from foreign lands, and alleged links between the engravings and Ogham inscriptions, are rejected by archaeologists.\n\nWithin the archaeological fraternity the site has become important in collegial debates on authorship of rock art in Southern Africa.\n\nAmongst rock art specialists there are two principal ideas concerning Driekops Eiland. One of them suggests that whereas sites such as the nearby Wildebeest Kuil, with its profusion of engravings of animals and some human figures, is quintessentially San/hunter-gatherer in character, the site of Driekops Eiland, with its massive preponderance of geometric engravings and very few animals and hardly any human figures, most likely belongs to a different tradition of rock art, now believed to be a separate Khoekhoe herder rock art tradition. This has been a persuasive argument, and the distribution of sites with geometric rock art appears to match the hypothesised migration routes by which herders are thought to have spread through South Africa about 2000 years ago. \n\nA different perspective on Driekops Eiland does not discount this possibility, that different identity groups have given rise to some of the variability between sites, but questions whether assigning variability in terms of ethnic or cultural differences in the first instance does not perhaps overlook degrees of complexity and other possible factors. This approach draws on archaeological sources, ethnographic clues, and palaeoenvironmental data to suggest that the environmental setting of the site was a locus of particular cultural and social significance. Ethnographic accounts, including those with reference to the social significance of water, show how features in the landscape could be imbued with meaning. Places and rock faces could become meaningful supports, mediating spirit worlds, the surfaces bearing the rock art images being a “most fundamental part of the context”.\n\nEthnographic sources, moreover, refer to ritual practices, specifically the female puberty rites, which have (or had) a specific geographical focus at the water source. Facial or body marking, and sometimes the daubing of objects, with ochre, scarification, and other modes, was a widely consistent feature of the ceremonies of reintroduction that concluded the rites (the literature is vast, from across the Khoe-San spectrum)\n\nIn Khoe-San ethnography, the spirit worlds over and under the earth are mediated by water in the form of rain and the waterhole It has been argued, that the hypothesized ritual practices and the rich field of social meanings in Khoe-San beliefs in relation to !\"Khwa\", the rain/water (or its manifestation as a mythical ‘watersnake’), and the initiate, referred to as the ‘new maiden’, can be conceived as converging in the nearly palpable power of place at Driekops Eiland – where glacially smoothed basement rock, aligned with the flow of the river, ‘bulges’ and ‘dips’, snake-like, above or below the water according to the season. The site resonates with environmental rhythms, and these, in turn, were very likely resources for cultural construal. Upon this great, smooth, undulating surface (itself perhaps construed as a giant, fecund ‘watersnake’ – associated with rivers in many tales), more than 3,500 rock engravings are densely placed, such that they become submerged when the rains come in the wet season, but equally are left high and dry when river flow dwindles, or ceases altogether.\n\nAs a powerful place, it is possible that Driekops Eiland became – in this view – a focus in rites, perhaps specifically those associated with the ‘new maiden’, who represented “the rain’s magic power” (according to ≠Kamme-an, Dia!kwain’s mother); that the place itself was an active element in these rites in the redefinition of social personhood; and that the power of the place was enhanced in particular periods in its history (perhaps periods of ritual intensification in response to environmental and/or social stress) by marking with engravings, which themselves may be a residue of ritual sequence. These rituals are or were practised with great emotional and symbolic intensity. \n\nIt is suggested that a metaphorical understanding of place – and the possibility that different parts of the landscape might vary in ritual significance (hilltops very likely being associated with rain-making rites) – may be factors more germane to the questions of variability in the rock art of the region than appeals primarily to ethnicity and cultural difference.\n\nDriekops Eiland was declared a National Monument in 1944. It automatically became a Grade 2 Provincial Heritage Site when the National Heritage Resources Act (Act 25 of 1999) was promulgated.\n\nA weir was built across the upper part of the site in 1942, causing permanent submergence of an estimated 150 engravings above the weir, and changing flood dynamics and silt accumulation patterns. The latter triggered, in turn, increased reed growth and an invasion of eucalyptus saplings across silted parts of the site - helped along by increased flow after a canal was built from the Orange River to the Kalfontein Dam (on the Riet River) in 1987.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "78302", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=78302", "title": "Flag of Finland", "text": "Flag of Finland\n\nThe flag of Finland (, ), also called \"siniristilippu\" (\"Blue Cross Flag\"), dates from the beginning of the 20th century. On a white background, it features a blue Nordic cross, which represents Christianity.\n\nThe state flag has a coat of arms in the centre, but is otherwise identical to the civil flag. The swallow-tailed state flag is used by the military. The presidential standard is identical to the swallow-tailed state flag but also has in its upper left corner the Cross of Liberty after the Order of the Cross of Liberty, which has the President of Finland as its Grand Master. Like Sweden's, Finland's national flag is based on the Scandinavian cross. It was adopted after independence from Russia, when many patriotic Finns wanted a special flag for their country, but its design dates back to the 19th century. The blue colouring is said to represent the country's thousands of lakes and the sky, with white for the snow that covers the land in winter. This colour combination has also been used over the centuries in various Finnish provincial, military, and town flags.\n\nThe first known \"Flag of Finland\" was presented in 1848, along with the national anthem Maamme. Its motif was the coat of arms of Finland, surrounded by laurel leaves, on a white flag.\n\nThe current blue-crossed design was first used in Finland by Nyländska Jaktklubben, a yacht club founded in Helsinki in 1861. In addition to the blue cross on the white background, the yacht club flag had the crowned arms of the province of Uusimaa within two crossed branches in the upper hoist quarter. Except for the position of the cross, the flag was similar to the flag of the St. Petersburg Yacht Club, founded the previous year. The design can be traced to the Russian Navy ensign, which has a blue cross saltire on a white background. During the Crimean War, Finnish merchant ships captured by the British-French fleet flew a flag called \"Flag of St. George\", which was based on the Russian Customs flag. In this variant, the cross was thinner than in the modern flag, and the proportions were equal. Another blue-cross flag was made official in 1861 for private vessels.\n\nIn 1910, in connection with Russification of Finland, the Russian authorities decreed that a Russian flag was to be added to the canton. However, this was met with resistance; the flag was derided as the \"slave's flag\" (\"orjalippu\"), and most Finns refused to fly it. Instead, a triangular pennant without this modification was flown, thereby circumventing the decree concerning flags.\n\nShortly after Finland gained independence in 1917, a competition was held for the design of the Finnish flag. Several different designs were submitted. Regarding the colours, the entries fell mainly into two categories – one using the red and yellow from the Finnish coat of arms, and the other using the present blue and white colours.\n\nOne entry had the Dannebrog cross design, but with a yellow cross on a red background. Another entry had diagonal blue and white stripes, but it was criticized as being more suitable for a barber shop than a newly independent country. Akseli Gallen-Kallela proposed a similar cross flag, but with colors inverted (white cross on blue), but this was considered too similar to the Swedish flag and particularly the Greek flag of the time. Finally, artists Eero Snellman and Bruno Tuukkanen specified the final form of the flag.\n\nThe state flag was further modified in 1922, when the coronet was removed, and again in 1978 when the shield-shaped coat of arms was changed into a rectangular shape.\n\nUnder Finnish law, the ratio of the flag is 11:18 (height:width), very close to the golden ratio. The swallow-tailed state flag is one unit longer and the tails are five units long. The cusp width of the blue cross is three units of measure, giving a ratio set of 4:3:4 (vertical) and 5:3:10 (horizontal). When flown from a flagpole, the flag is recommended to have a width equalling one sixth of the height of the pole.\n\nThe Finnish flag is used in three main variants. The usual national flag is used by all citizens, organizations and Finnish municipalities and regions. Anyone is allowed to fly the national flag whenever they deem it suitable. The rectangular state flag is used by bodies of the Finnish national and provincial governments, by the Cathedral Chapters of the two national churches (Evangelical Lutheran and Orthodox), and non-naval vessels of the state.\n\nThe swallow-tailed national flag, which is also the naval ensign, is flown by the Finnish Defence Forces. The presidential standard and the command signs of the Minister of Defence, Chief of Defence, and Commander of the Finnish Navy are flown only by the respective persons.\n\nAll public bodies as well as most private citizens and corporations fly the flag on official flag days. In addition to the official flag days, there are about ten unofficial but generally observed flag days. Besides flag days, normally, no flags or corporate flags are flown.\n\nThe Finnish flag is raised at 8 am and lowered at sunset, however not later than 9 pm. On independence day, the flag is flown until 8 pm regardless of the dark. On the occasion of great national tragedies, the ministry of interior may recommend flying the flag at half mast throughout the country.\n\nAs a special custom in Finland, the flag is flown at Midsummer from 6 pm of Midsummer eve until 9 pm of Midsummer's day. This is done to symbolize the fact that the darkness does not come to any part of Finland during Midsummer's Night. Midsummer is also celebrated as the day of the Finnish flag.\n\nThe colours are defined in both CIE 1931 and CIE 1976 standards, Swedish standard and by the Pantone Matching System:\n\nThere is no official RGB definition for the colors, because its color gamut is too narrow. From the CIE L*a*b* colors the unofficial approximations in sRGB are (range 0–255): blue R=24, G=68, B=126, red R=181, G=28, B=49 and yellow R=237, G=167, B=0. The yellow color actually lies outside the sRBG colorspace. The blue color is called \"sea blue\", which is a dark to medium blue. It is not very dark navy blue, and certainly not any bright or greenish shade such as turquoise or cyan. It may be substituted for heraldic tincture azure.\n\nRed and yellow are used in the coat of arms that appears on the state flag.\n\nAlternatively, artists or students might find it helpful to know that the blue color in the current civic use National Flag (no variant), has an approximate hex color of: #002f6c or an RGB of R:0 G:47 B:108. These colors are converted from Pantone 294 C as stated above in the table.\n\nBy Finnish law it is forbidden to deface the flag or to use it in a disrespectful way. It is also illegal to remove a flag from its pole without permission. Anyone who breaks these regulations may be fined for disgracing the flag.\n\nFinnish law also forbids the use of the presidential standard or state flag without permission, as well as the addition of any extra symbols to the flag. One may not sell a flag which has different colours or geometry than defined by the law. These are considered violations of the flag regulations and can lead to a fine.\n\nThere are also common rules on how to treat the flag respectfully. The flag must not be dirty or damaged. The flag must never touch the ground. When the flag is washed, it must be dried indoors. A worn-out flag must be disposed of by burning (though not with the intent to disgrace it), or alternatively by cutting it to pieces small enough not to be recognizable as parts of the flag. The flag must not be buried in the ground or the sea (including not throwing it into the garbage).\n\nA Finnish specialty is that any yachting club registered in Finland may apply to have a flag with the club emblem officially approved for use on yachts. Such an ensign will be the civil ensign with a white cross, of a unit wide, superimposed on the blue cross and with the club emblem in the upper hoist corner. Most yachting clubs distribute these ensigns to their members, and they are much used, but their use is not recommended outside Finnish waters to avoid confusion. Officially, however, the yachting club ensign is valid even for international use.\n\n\n"}

A joint Centre of the University of Geneva and the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, CERAH is firmly anchored in Geneva's rich academic environment. It is one of the few institutes dedicated to the study of humanitarian action. It offers modular and flexible academic training programmes, distance or residential ones, and scholarship opportunities.\n\nAs Geneva's academic platform for humanitarian action, CERAH's focus lies on capacity strengthening and the reinforcement of both individual and collective competencies with the ultimate goal of contributing to an improved quality of the humanitarian response. Its programmes allow participants to develop a strong understanding of various conceptual and operational aspects of humanitarian action and equip them to define and implement strategic humanitarian responses.\n\nOffering a variety of courses ranging from short courses (TSC) to a comprehensive Master's programme, CERAH provides flexible and modular opportunities for professionals to deepen their knowledge. The current educational offer encompasses seven postgraduate programmes (a master programme, one diploma, and five certificate courses) and a dozen of intensive courses on specific issues (TSC). Responding to its international audience, CERAH offers a distance-learning course in \"Designing Strategies and Projects for Humanitarian Action\" which allows participants to study and learn from their own context, without having to be in Geneva. During the course students develop an action plan, which they can directly implement in their work situation. In addition, CERAH offers a Massive Open Online Course on Humanitarian Communications, in partnership with the University of Geneva.\n\nHumanitarian studies lie at the crossroads of various disciplines. As a result, CERAH promotes a multi-disciplinary approach to learning, and draws on the expertise of a range of academics and practitioners.\n\nCERAH also undertakes critical research that aims to assess concepts, policies and responses in order to improve humanitarian responses.\n\nCERAH was founded in 1998 with the support of the University of Geneva and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation. Its existence is a testimony to the gradual and collective effort over the past 19 years of bringing together a multitude of academic and humanitarian actors.\n\nThe Centre underwent several phases of transformation. At the time of its establishment, it was known as the Multifaculty Programme for Humanitarian Action (PPAH) and only offered a university diploma. It was set up to provide high-level, continuing university education to humanitarian practitioners. The Centre was transformed in 2004, following its partnership with the Graduate Institute of International Aid Development studies. Renamed as the Interdisciplinary Programme in Humanitarian Action (PIAH), it introduced an advanced masters programme in collaboration with the I International Committee of the Red Cross and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) Suisse. A reform process in 2008 led to the creation of CERAH, as we know it today. Changes at the international level as well as in the academic and humanitarian fields led the Geneva university community to envisage a more ambitious role for CERAH.\n\nIn subsequent years, particularly after 2011, under the leadership of Professor Doris Schopper, CERAH revised its postgraduate educational offer to better respond to the needs of humanitarian organizations and professionals. It led to the development of seven postgraduate degrees (1 MAS, 1 DAS, 5 CAS) and several one-week intensive seminars on specific issues.\n\nThe MAS in Humanitarian Action is a 10- to 12-month full-time programme of 60 European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) credits. The programme is focused on building in-depth understanding of the central conceptual and operational aspects of humanitarian action.\n\nThe multidisciplinary and interactive programme, delivered in English, comprises three parts:\nSince 2012, the MAS in Humanitarian Action is offered to international managers in the humanitarian and development sector (with at least 2 years of working experience and holding a higher education institution degree), who wish to deepen their competencies in specific areas and add an academic and analytical dimension to their professional skills. Its modular set-up allows for maximum flexibility. Participant can complete the MAS in 1, 2 or 3 years.\n\nThis programme was awarded unconditional accreditation by the Swiss Center of Accreditation and Quality Assurance in Higher Education (AAQ).\n\nThe Diploma of Advanced Studies in Humanitarian Action is a 19-week programme of 30 ECTS credits. This core course is divided in three modules and completed by an individual work (dissertation). Through the study of past and present humanitarian crises, participants acquire the tools needed to analyse, understand and engage in critical reflection on the response to humanitarian emergencies today.\n\nAcademics and experts from a wide range of NGOs and international organisations deliver lectures. The programme is participatory, based on case studies and discussions.\n\nCERAH also offers seven-week 10-ECTS certificate courses. The courses are designed for managers to improve their competencies and leadership in defining and implementing specific strategies, while focusing on problem-solving in professional realities.\n\nList of CAS courses available:\n\n\nWithin the CAS programmes, CERAH offers an 8-month distance-learning programme \"Designing Strategies and Projects in Humanitarian Action\", which comprises 15 ECTS. The course enhances the capacity of individual and institutional humanitarian actors to devise and implement effective humanitarian responses:\n\n\"Learn as you work, work as you learn.\" Specifically adapted to the needs of working humanitarian professionals, this course allows participants to study and learn from their own context. During the course students develop an action plan, which they can directly implement in their work situation. The programme is fairly autonomous where students develop their own learning objectives based on current challenges. At the end of the programme, participants develop relevant competencies to design and adapt humanitarian strategies and projects according to the specifics of each context.\n\nThe course involves e-learning, a residential session in Kampala (Uganda) and individual coaching.\n\nCERAH developed the Humanitarian Distance Learning programme to increase access to training particularly for national staff as well as to allow students to study from their own context.\n\nSpecific themes are proposed as 1-week Thematic Short Courses (TSC). Offering topics that matter (e.g. nutrition, sexual violence, forced migration, negotiation) the courses attract new audiences and eventually, encourage participants to enrol in other trainings.\n\nList of TSC courses available: \n\nThe Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) \"Humanitarian communication: addressing key challenges\" focuses on the challenges of communication in humanitarian settings and the means of addressing these. This 5-week online course is repeated throughout the academic year.\n\nCERAH staff conducts research on a range of themes linked to humanitarian action including health, law, protracted crises and the political economy of humanitarian crises.\n\nThe Humanitarian Encyclopedia is a flagship project from CERAH to explore the different ways key humanitarian concepts are understood across space, time and disciplines . This new project offers a conceptual framework for humanitarian action, and providing a dynamic platform for national and international practitioners, community leaders, policy makers and academics to reflect on humanitarian concepts and practice for the 21st century.\n"}

His name is particularly associated with the initiation of the plate work \"Flora Danica\".\n\nOeder was the son of a Bavarian parish minister and theologian, Georg Ludwig Oeder (1694–1760). He studied medicine at the University of Göttingen under Albrecht von Haller. He then settled as a doctor of medicine in the city of Schleswig. The king called him to Copenhagen in 1751, on von Haller's recommendation. The autonomous – and conservative - University of Copenhagen, reluctant as it was to employ foreign experts, resisted Oeder's appointment in an ordinary chair. Thus, he was appointed \"Professor botanices regius\" (Royal Professor) and soon led the installation of a new botanic garden. From 1753 he led the publication of a monumental botanical plate work, \"Flora Danica\", which at first was planned to cover all plants, including bryophytes, lichens and fungi native to crown lands of the Danish king – Denmark, Schleswig-Holstein, Oldenburg-Delmenhorst and Norway – with its North Atlantic dependencies Iceland, the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Oeder visited the mountain regions of Norway up to Trondheim during the years 1758-1760. Consequently, the first fascicles of Flora Danica contain many alpine plant species. Oeder also corresponded with the Norwegian bishop and botanist Johan Ernst Gunnerus during the time.\nOeder also built up a considerable botanical library, mainly through purchase from colleagues abroad. English and American literature was obtained from Philip Miller of Chelsea Physic Garden and as many as 1327 volumes were bought from the estate of Richard Mead in 1754.\n\nAt the time of Oeder, botany was amalgamated with economy at large. Oeder thus was also a member of a number of commissions on agrarian reforms (e.g. “Landkommissionen” in 1770) and state finances ('Finanskollegiet' in 1771). From the first Danish census, which was soon destroyed, he extracted data on married couples, widowers and widows in all parishes of Zealand, Amager, Møn and Bornholm – these excerpts are now valuable data to genealogists. Oeder advocated the need for charities for widows. At large, Oeder was a spokesman of social reform and freedom of the rural population.\n\nWith the fall of Johann Friedrich Struensee in 1771 and the consequent crisis in state finances and the strengthening of anti-enlightenment and anti-German conservative circles, Oeder lost his professorship. He was first given the post as prefect (stiftamtmand) of Trondhjem stift, but never installed. He then was given a little honorable post as bailiff (Landvogt) in Oldenburg, which was then under Danish rule, but to be exchanged to Holstein-Gottorp in 1773. Two years before his death, he was ennobled by emperor Joseph II. He was buried in the churchyard of St. Gertrude's Chapel (\"Gertrudenfriedhof\") in Oldenburg.\n\nThe plant genus \"Oedera\" L. was named to his honour. A number of species have been named similarly, e.g. \"Pedicularis oederi\" Vahl and \"Carex oederi\" Retz.\n\n\n"}

Cheesecake sometimes serves as a groom's cake. The groom's cake is often served at a table separate from the wedding cake at a wedding reception or wedding breakfast, though it may be served as a dessert for a rehearsal dinner.\n\nThe tradition of the groom's cake began in Britain. The groom's cake was often richer than the bride's, since stronger flavors such as chocolate, fruitcake, and alcohol were considered more appropriate to \"the stronger sex.\" Groom's cakes during the Victorian era were heavy, dense fruitcakes. A characteristic recipe for the groom's fruit cake was published in \"The British Baker\" in 1897. Eventually, flour cakes, either white or chocolate, supplanted fruit cakes as the most popular choice.\n\nGroom’s cake is a tradition most popular in the southeastern United States. It was brought over from Britain by colonists. The Southern groom's cake was traditionally a dark-liquor soaked fruitcake, especially in Virginia. The white-iced bride's cake was considered too light for masculinity. Chocolate groom's cakes became popular in the late 19th century, and can be any flavor, such as carrot cake, red velvet cake, etc.\"\n\nGroom's cakes are usually served at the wedding reception as a second flavor choice to the guests, but are often served at the rehearsal dinner in some regions. Groom's Cakes are often decorated to reflect the groom's hobbies or interests, such as golfing, fishing, hunting, or sports. The 1989 movie \"Steel Magnolias\" features a famous scene with a red velvet groom's cake shaped as a giant armadillo.\n\nAnother tradition was to cut a piece of the cake and put it in a small box, then present the box to an unmarried woman attending the wedding. The woman was not expected to eat the cake, but rather to put it under her pillow. Superstition held that this tradition would help an unmarried woman find a husband.\n"}
{"id": "2338291", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2338291", "title": "Guru–shishya tradition", "text": "Guru–shishya tradition\n\nThe guru–shishya tradition, or parampara (\"lineage\"), denotes a succession of teachers and disciples in traditional Indian culture and religions such as Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism and Buddhism (Tibetan and Zen tradition). It is the tradition of spiritual relationship and mentoring where teachings are transmitted from a \"guru\" \"teacher\" () to a \"śiṣya\" \"disciple\" () or \"chela\". Such knowledge, whether it be Vedic, agamic, architectural, musical or spiritual, is imparted through the developing relationship between the guru and the disciple. It is considered that this relationship, based on the genuineness of the guru, and the respect which is not based on age or how old one looks, commitment, devotion and obedience of the student, is the best way for subtle or advanced knowledge to be conveyed. The student eventually masters the knowledge that the guru embodies.\n\nIn the early oral traditions of the Upanishads, the \"guru–shishya\" relationship had evolved into a fundamental component of Hinduism. The term \"Upanishad\" derives from the Sanskrit words \"upa\" (near), \"ni\" (down) and \"şad\" (to sit) — so it means \"sitting down near\" a spiritual teacher to receive instruction. The relationship between Krishna and Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita portion of the Mahabharata, and between Rama and Hanuman in the Ramayana, are examples. In the Upanishads, gurus and disciples appear in a variety of settings (e.g. a husband answering questions about immortality; a teenage boy being taught by Yama, Hinduism's Lord of Death) Sometimes the sages are women, and the instructions may be sought by kings.\n\nIn the Vedas, the knowledge of Brahman (\"brahmavidya\") is communicated from guru to \"shishya\" by oral lore.\n\nWithin the broad spectrum of the Hindu religion, the \"guru–shishya\" relationship can be found in numerous variant forms including tantra. Some common elements in this relationship include:\n\n\nTraditionally the word used for a succession of teachers and disciples in ancient Indian culture is \"parampara\" (' in IAST). In the \"parampara\" system, knowledge (in any field) is believed to be passed down through successive generations. The Sanskrit word figuratively means \"an uninterrupted series or succession\". Sometimes defined as \"the passing down of Vedic knowledge\", it is believed to be always entrusted to the \"\". An established \"parampara\" is often called ', or school of thought. For example, in Vaishnavism a number of \"sampradayas\" are developed following a single teacher, or an acharya. While some argue for freedom of interpretation others maintain that \"Although an \"\" speaks according to the time and circumstance in which he appears, he upholds the original conclusion, or \"\", of the Vedic literature.\"\n\nAkhara is a place of practice with facilities for boarding, lodging and training, both in the context of Indian martial artists or a \"Sampradaya\" monastery for religious renunciates. For example, in the context of the Dashanami Sampradaya sect, the word denotes both martial arts and religious monastic aspects of the trident wielding martial regiment of renunciate sadhus.\n\nThere is a variation in the level of authority that may be granted to the guru. The highest is that found in bhakti yoga, and the lowest is in the \"pranayama\" forms of yoga such as the Sankara Saranam movement. Between these two there are many variations in degree and form of authority.\n\nAdvaita Vedānta requires anyone seeking to study Advaita Vedānta to do so from a guru (\"teacher\"). The guru must have the following qualities (see \"Mundaka Upanishad\" 1.2.12):\nThe seeker must serve the guru and submit his questions with all humility so that doubt may be removed. (see Bhagavad Gita 4.34). According to Advaita, the seeker will be able to attain \"liberation from the cycle of births and deaths\" (\"moksha\").\n\nThe \"guru–shishya\" tradition plays an important part in the Shruti tradition of Vaidika dharma. The Hindus believe that the Vedas have been handed down through the ages from guru to \"shishya\". The Vedas themselves prescribe for a young brahmachari to be sent to a Gurukul where the Guru (referred to also as acharya) teaches the pupil the Vedas and Vedangas. The pupil is also taught the \"Prayoga\" to perform yajnas. The term of stay varies (Manu Smriti says the term may be 12 years, 36 years or 48 years). After the stay at the Gurukul the brahmachari returns home after performing a ceremony called samavartana.\n\nThe word Śrauta is derived from the word Śruti meaning that which is heard. The Śrauta tradition is a purely oral handing down of the Vedas, but many modern Vedic scholars make use of books as a teaching tool.\n\nThe guru passes his knowledge to his disciples by virtue of the fact that his purified consciousness enters into the selves of his disciples and communicates its particular characteristic. In this process the disciple is made part of the spiritual family (kula) - a family which is not based on blood relations but on people of the same knowledge.\n\nThe best known form of the \"guru–shishya\" relationship is that of bhakti. Bhakti (Sanskrit = Devotion) means surrender to God or guru. Bhakti extends from the simplest expression of devotion to the ego-destroying principle of prapatti, which is total surrender. The bhakti form of the \"guru–shishya\" relationship generally incorporates three primary beliefs or practices:\n\n\nIn the ego-destroying principle of \"prapatti\" (Sanskrit, \"Throwing oneself down\"), the level of the submission of the will of the \"shishya\" to the will of God or the guru is sometimes extreme, and is often coupled with an attitude of personal helplessness, self-effacement and resignation. This doctrine is perhaps best expressed in the teachings of the four \"Samayacharya\" saints, who shared a profound and mystical love of Siva expressed by:\n\n\nIn its most extreme form it sometimes includes:\n\n\nOften a guru will assert that he or she is capable of leading a \"shishya\" directly to the highest possible state of spirituality or consciousness, sometimes referred to within Hinduism as moksha. In the bhakti \"guru–shishya\" relationship the guru is often believed to have supernatural powers, leading to the deification of the guru.\n\nIn the Pali Buddhist tradition,magae the Bhikkus are also known as Sekhas (SN XLVIII.53 Sekha Sutta).\nIn the Theravada Buddhist tradition, the teacher is a valued and honoured mentor worthy of great respect and a source of inspiration on the path to Enlightenment. In the Tibetan tradition, however, the teacher is viewed as the very root of spiritual realization and the basis of the entire path. Without the teacher, it is asserted, there can be no experience or insight. The guru is seen as Buddha. In Tibetan texts, emphasis is placed upon praising the virtues of the guru. Tantric teachings include generating visualisations of the guru and making offerings praising the guru. The guru becomes known as the \"vajra\" (figuratively \"diamond\") guru, the one who is the source of initiation into the tantric deity. The disciple is asked to enter into a series of vows and commitments that ensure the maintenance of the spiritual link with the understanding that to break this link is a serious downfall.\n\nIn Vajrayana (tantric Buddhism) as the guru is perceived as \"the way\" itself. The guru is not an individual who initiates a person, but the person's own Buddha-nature reflected in the personality of the guru. In return, the disciple is expected to show great devotion to his or her guru, who he or she regards as one who possesses the qualities of a Bodhisattva. A guru is regarded as one which has not only mastered the words of the tradition, but one that with which the student has an intense personal relationship; thus, devotion is seen as the proper attitude toward the guru.\n\nThe Dalai Lama, speaking of the importance of the guru, said: \"Rely on the teachings to evaluate a guru: Do not have blind faith, but also no blind criticism.\" He also observed that the term 'living Buddha' is a translation of the Chinese words \"huo fuo\".\n\nRob Preece, in \"The Wisdom of Imperfection,\" writes that while the teacher/disciple relationship can be an invaluable and fruitful experience, the process of relating to spiritual teachers also has its hazards.\n\nAs other authors had done before him, Preece mentions the notion of transference to explain the manner in which the guru/disciple relationship develops from a more Western psychological perspective. He writes:\n\nPreece writes that when we transfer an inner quality onto another person we may be giving that person a power over us as a consequence of the projection, carrying the potential for great insight and inspiration, but also the potential for great danger.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10400", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10400", "title": "History of Esperanto", "text": "History of Esperanto\n\nL. L. Zamenhof developed Esperanto in the 1870s and 80s and published the first publication about it, \"Unua Libro\", in 1887. The number of Esperanto speakers has grown gradually since then, although it has not had much support from governments and international organizations and has sometimes been outlawed or otherwise suppressed.\n\nAround 1880, while in Moscow and approximately simultaneously with working on Esperanto, Zamenhof made an aborted attempt to standardize Yiddish, based on his native Bialystok (Northeastern) dialect, as a unifying language for the Jews of the Russian Empire. He even used a Latin alphabet, with the letters \"ć, h́, ś, ź\" (the same as in early drafts of Esperanto, later \"ĉ, ĥ, ŝ, ĵ\") and \"ě\" for schwa. However, he concluded there was no future for such a project, and abandoned it, dedicating himself to Esperanto as a unifying language for all humankind. Paul Wexler proposed that Esperanto was not an arbitrary pastiche of major European languages but a Latinate relexification of Yiddish, a native language of its founder. This model is generally unsupported by mainstream linguists.\n\nZamenhof would later say that he had dreamed of a world language since he was a child. At first he considered a revival of Latin, but after learning it in school he decided it was too complicated to be a common means of international communication. When he learned English, he realised that verb conjugations were unnecessary, and that grammatical systems could be much simpler than he had expected. He still had the problem of memorising a large vocabulary, until he noticed two Russian signs labelled \"Швейцарская\" (\"švejtsarskaja,\" a porter's lodge – from \"швейцар\" \"švejtsar,\" a porter) and \"Кондитерская\" (\"konditerskaja,\" a confectioner's shop – from \"кондитер\" \"konditer,\" a confectioner). He then realised that a judicious use of affixes could greatly decrease the number of root words needed for communication. He chose to take his vocabulary from Romance and Germanic, the languages that were most widely taught in schools around the world and would therefore be recognisable to the largest number of people.\n\nZamenhof taught an early version of the language to his high-school classmates. Then, for several years, he worked on translations and poetry to refine his creation. In 1895 he wrote, \"I worked for six years perfecting and testing the language, even though it had seemed to me in 1878 that it was already completely ready.\" When he was ready to publish, the Czarist censors would not allow it. Stymied, he spent his time in translating works such as the Bible and Shakespeare. This enforced delay led to continued improvement. In July 1887 he published his \"Unua Libro\" (\"First Book\"), a basic introduction to the language. This was essentially the language spoken today.\n\n\"Unua Libro\" was published in 1887. At first the movement grew most in the Russian empire and eastern Europe, but soon spread to western Europe and beyond: to Argentina in 1889; to Canada in 1901; to Algeria, Chile, Japan, Mexico, and Peru in 1903; to Tunisia in 1904; and to Australia, the United States, Guinea, Indochina, New Zealand, Tonkin, and Uruguay in 1905.\n\nIn its first years Esperanto was used mainly in publications by Zamenhof and early adopters like Antoni Grabowski, in extensive correspondence (mostly now lost), in the magazine \"La Esperantisto\", published from 1889 to 1895 and only occasionally in personal encounters.\n\nIn 1894, under pressure from Wilhelm Trompeter, the publisher of the magazine \"La Esperantisto\", and some other leading users, Zamenhof reluctantly put forward a radical reform to be voted on by readers. He proposed the reduction of the alphabet to 22 letters (by eliminating the accented letters and most of their sounds), the change of the plural to \"-i\", the use of a positional accusative instead of the ending \"-n\", the removal of the distinction between adjectives and adverbs, the reduction of the number of participles from six to two, and the replacement of the table of correlatives with more Latinate words or phrases. These reforms were overwhelmingly rejected, but some were picked up in subsequent reforms (such as Ido) and criticisms of the language. In the following decade Esperanto spread into western Europe, especially France. By 1905 there were already 27 magazines being published (Auld 1988).\n\nA small international conference was held in 1904, leading to the first world congress in August 1905 in Boulogne-sur-Mer, France. There were 688 Esperanto speakers present from 20 nationalities. At this congress, Zamenhof officially resigned his leadership of the Esperanto movement, as he did not want personal prejudice against himself (or anti-Semitism) to hinder the progress of the language. He proposed a declaration on founding principles of the Esperanto movement, which the attendees of the congress endorsed.\n\nWorld congresses have been held every year since 1905, except during the two World Wars.\n\nThe autonomous territory of Neutral Moresnet, between Belgium and Germany, had a sizable proportion of Esperanto-speakers among its small and multiethnic population. There was a proposal to make Esperanto its official language.\n\nIn the early 1920s, a great opportunity seemed to arise for Esperanto when the Iranian delegation to the League of Nations proposed that it be adopted for use in international relations, following a report by Nitobe Inazō, an official delegate of League of Nations during the 13th World Congress of Esperanto in Prague. Ten delegates accepted the proposal with only one voice against, the French delegate, Gabriel Hanotaux. Hanotaux did not like how the French language was losing its position as the international language and saw Esperanto as a threat. However, two years later the League recommended that its member states include Esperanto in their educational curricula. Many people see the 1920s as the heyday of the Esperanto movement.\n\nIn 1941, the Soviet Union started performing mass arrests, deportations, and killings of many Esperantists and their relatives for fear of an anti-nationalistic movement, but it was interrupted by the Nazi invasion.\n\nHitler wrote in \"Mein Kampf\" that it was created as a universal language to unite the Jewish diaspora.\nThe creation of a Jew-free National German Esperanto League was not enough to placate the Nazis.\nThe teaching of Esperanto was not allowed in German prisoner-of-war camps during World War II. Esperantists sometimes were able to get around the ban by convincing guards that they were teaching Italian, the language of Germany's closest ally.\nIn the early years of the Soviet Union, Esperanto was given a measure of government support, and an officially recognized Soviet Esperanto Association came into being. However, in 1937, Stalin reversed this policy. He denounced Esperanto as \"the language of spies\" and had Esperantists exiled or executed. The use of Esperanto was effectively banned until 1956.\nWhile Esperanto itself was not enough cause for execution, its use was extended among Jews or trade unionists and encouraged contacts with foreigners.\n\nFascist Italy, on the other hand, made some efforts of promoting tourism in Italy through Esperanto leaflets and appreciated the similarities of Italian and Esperanto.\n\nPortugal's right-wing governments cracked down on the language from 1936 until the Carnation Revolution of 1974. After the Spanish Civil War, Francoist Spain cracked down on the Anarchists and Catalan nationalists among whom the speaking of Esperanto had been quite widespread; but in the 1950s, the Esperanto movement was tolerated again, with Francisco Franco accepting the honorary patronage of the Madrid World Esperanto Congress.\n\nThe Cold War, especially in the 1950s and 1960s, put a damper on the Esperanto movement as well, as there were fears on both sides that Esperanto could be used for enemy propaganda. However, the language experienced something of a renaissance in the 1970s and spread to new parts of the world, such as its veritable explosion in popularity in Iran in 1975. By 1991 there were enough African Esperantists to warrant a pan-African congress. The language continues to spread, although it is not officially recognised by any country, and is part of the state educational curriculum of only a few.\n\nThe Declaration of Boulogne (1905) limited changes to Esperanto. That declaration stated, among other things, that the basis of the language should remain the \"Fundamento de Esperanto\" (\"Foundation of Esperanto\", a group of early works by Zamenhof), which is to be binding forever: nobody has the right to make changes to it. The declaration also permits new concepts to be expressed as the speaker sees fit, but it recommends doing so in accordance with the original style.\n\nMany Esperantists believe this declaration stabilising the language is a major reason why the Esperanto speaker community grew beyond the levels attained by other constructed languages and has developed a flourishing culture. Other constructed languages have been hindered from developing a stable speaking community by continual tinkering. Also, many developers of constructed languages have been possessive of their creation and have worked to prevent others from contributing to the language. One such ultimately disastrous case was Schleyer's Volapük. In contrast, Zamenhof declared that \"Esperanto belongs to the Esperantists\", and moved to the background once the language was published, allowing others to share in the early development of the language.\n\nThe grammatical description in the earliest books was somewhat vague, so a consensus on usage (influenced by Zamenhof's answers to some questions) developed over time within boundaries set by the initial outline (Auld 1988). Even before the Declaration of Boulogne, the language was remarkably stable; only one set of lexical changes were made in the first year after publication, namely changing \"when\", \"then\", \"never\", \"sometimes\", \"always\" from \"kian\", \"tian\", \"nenian\", \"ian\", \"ĉian\" to \"kiam\", \"tiam\", \"neniam\" etc., to avoid confusion with the accusative forms of \"kia\" \"what sort of\", \"tia\" \"that sort of\", etc. Thus Esperanto achieved a stability of structure and grammar similar to that which natural languages enjoy by virtue of their native speakers and established bodies of literature. One could learn Esperanto without having it move from underfoot. Changes could and did occur in the language, but only by acquiring widespread popular support; there was no central authority making arbitrary changes, as happened with Volapük and some other languages.\n\nModern Esperanto usage may in fact depart from that originally described in the \"Fundamento\", though the differences are largely semantic (involving changed meaning of words) rather than grammatical or phonological. The translation given for \"I like this one\", in the sample phrases in the main Esperanto article, offers a significant example. According to the \"Fundamento\", \"Mi ŝatas ĉi tiun\" would in fact have meant \"I esteem this one\". The traditional usage is \"Tiu ĉi plaĉas al mi\" (literally, \"this one is pleasing to me\"), which reflects the phrasing of most European languages (French \"celui-ci me plaît\", Spanish \"éste me gusta\", Russian \"это мне нравится\" [eto mnye nravitsya], German \"Das gefällt mir\", Italian \"mi piace\"). However, the original \"Ĉi tiu plaĉas al mi\" continues to be commonly used.\n\nFor later changes to the language, see Modern evolution of Esperanto.\n\nEsperanto has not fragmented into regional dialects through natural language use. This may be because it is the language of daily communication for only a small minority of its speakers. However at least three other factors work against dialects, namely the centripetal force of the Fundamento, the unifying influence of the Plena Vortaro and its successors, which exemplified usage from the works of Zamenhof and leading writers, and the transnational ambitions of the speech community itself. Slang and jargon have developed to some extent, but such features interfere with universal communication – the whole point of Esperanto – and so have generally been avoided.\n\nHowever, in the early twentieth century numerous reform projects were proposed. Almost all of these Esperantidos were stillborn, but the very first, Ido (\"Offspring\"), had significant success for several years. Ido was proposed by the Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language in Paris in October 1907. Its main reforms were in bringing the alphabet, semantics, and some grammatical features into closer alignment with the Romance languages, as well as removal of adjectival agreement and the accusative case except when necessary. At first, a number of leading Esperantists put their support behind the Ido project, but the movement stagnated and declined, first with the accidental death of one of its main proponents and later as people proposed further changes, and the number of current speakers is estimated at between 250 and 5000. However, Ido has proven to be a rich source of Esperanto vocabulary.\n\nSome more focused reform projects, affecting only a particular feature of the language, have gained a few adherents. One of these is riism, which modifies the language to incorporate non-sexist language and gender-neutral pronouns. However, most of these projects are specific to individual nationalities (riism from English speakers, for example), and the only changes that have gained acceptance in the Esperanto community have been the minor and gradual bottom-up reforms discussed in the last section.\n\nEsperanto is credited with influencing or inspiring several later competing language projects, such as Occidental (1922) and Novial (1928). These always lagged far behind Esperanto in their popularity. By contrast, Interlingua (1951) has greatly surpassed Ido in terms of popularity. It shows little or no Esperanto influence, however.\n\n\n\n\nRonald Creagh & Karine Tourraton. \"A Short History of Anarchist Participation in the Esperanto Movement\". \n"}

It claims to be the highest authority for all matters regarding the Delphic Games of the modern era, although there is a similar but separate organization, International Delphic Committee, headquartered in Russia.\n\nThe Delphic Games of the modern era were inspired by the ancient Greece traditional Pythian Games of Delphi as a symbol for peace. The original Games were between artists and ethnic cultural groups. They took place each year preceding to the Olympic Games. The historic Pythian Games in Delphi can be traced as far back as 2,600 years ago. The spiritual leaders formed the Pan-Hellenic to perform wonders, theatre, music, and poetry to praise the god Apollo of wonderful light, the symbol of the Oracle of Delphi. The Pythian Games were one of the four Panhellenic Games, a forerunner of the modern Olympic Games, held every four years at the sanctuary of Apollo at Delphi.\n\nAfter the revival of the Olympic Games, art competitions were held from 1912 to 1948 at the initiative of Pierre de Coubertin. Competitions in various forms of art were thematically related exclusively to the sport.\n\nAlso in the first half of the 20th century, there was a move to revive the Pythian Games at Delphi, at the initiative by the Greek poet Angelos Sikelianos. In 1927, the Delphic Festival was held for the first time, but the revival was then abandoned due to the cost of organizing it. Delphic Festivals are held in the summer in Delphi, focused largely on tourists.\n\nThe International Delphic Council (IDC) was founded in 1994. The founder J. Christian B. Kirsch invited people from eighteen nations to Berlin to the founding congress in Schönhausen Palace, aiming to revive the Delphic Games and to provide a forum for worldwide arts and culture. Representative were from Argentina, Austria, China, Cyprus, Ecuador, France, Germany, Greece, Kazakhstan, Libya, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Mexico, Nigeria, Philippines, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, Switzerland, United States.\n\nThe symbols of the International Delphic Movement imitate the symbols of the Olympics. The flag with the Delphic rings that are connected in a circle like a flower, was designed by Christian Kirsch and symbolizes the connection of the six Delphic art categories.\n\nThe first president of the IDC was Ebun A. Oyagbola of Nigeria, the general secretary and founder is J. Christian B. Kirsch of Germany, and the current president is Divina Bautista of Philippines, in office since 2009.\n\nThe IDC executive board is elected for two years by the general assembly of the IDC. On the ninth session of the IDC in Jeju, Korea, the current executive board was elected.\n\nThe International Delphic Council has \"Delphic Ambassadors\", including celebrities such as Nelson Mandela (South Africa) and Lothar de Maizière (Germany).\n\nThe International Delphic Council (IDC) is the co-ordinator and chief executive body of the worldwide Delphic Network. The member countries will establish national Delphic organisations (council, committee, association, union, etc.) which will coordinate with the IDC to promote and organize the Delphic Games. They receive from the IDC, the confirmation of admission after the official registration in the country.\n\nAfter 1994, national chapters in Belarus, Germany, Georgia, Greece, China, Japan, Nigeria, Philippines, Russia and the United State were particularly active. The first regional Youth Delphic Games were held in Georgia, Albania and Russia.\n\nThe National Delphic organizations design their own logo, which includes some of the IDC symbols. In preparation of the national qualifications specially designed logos of these national games, which are endorsed by IDC.\n\nNDC Korea won the bid to host the third Delphic Games 2009 in Jeju. The decision on the venue of the next Delphic Games will be taken by vote of the members of the IDC Board at an extraordinary meeting.\n\nThe national Delphic organization of the host country together with IDC prepare for holding Delphic Games. This initiative has received greetings from Yehudi Menuhin and Elena Obraztsova, among others.\n\nThe National Delphic organizations of host countries produce after meeting with the IDC thematic posters, brochures, stamps and other products that are dedicated to the Delphic Games and the IDC Congress.\n\nIDC and NDC Russia\n\nThe National Delphic Council of Russia (NDC Russia) held its founding in December 1998, at conference in Kursk, where secretary general of the IDC Christian Kirsch participated. 19 March 1999 was NDC Russia at the Ministry of Justice registered, and soon afterwards officially recorded in the International Delphic Council recorded, according to IDC-status.\n\n26 June 2000, the head of NDC Russia V. Ponyavin turned to the secretary general of the IDC C. Kirsch, with the request, the first Delphic Games for adults in Moscow from 1 to 10 December 2000 let to hold. This request was granted.\n\nLater, however, the Russian NDC split off from the International Delphic Council. Today, various Russian websites and Pressa claim, the Delphic idea was originated by the Russians in 2000.\nDespite the withdrawal of the Russian National Delphic Council from the International Delphic Council, the Russian delegations took part in the International Delphic Games in 2007 and 2009. This confirm also the illustrated Delphic calendars.\n\nThe IDC, organize adult and junior Delphic Games every four years, two years apart from each other in different countries – the countries having interest to host the games are urged to bid for and it is being decided by the eleven IDC board members.\n\nThe Delphic Games is in six Delphic Art Categories, and it is under the patronage of international institutions - the Council of Europe, UNESCO and ASEAN states.\n\nSince 1997 seven international Delphic Games has been organized - three for adults and four for juniors.\n\nTo the 15th Anniversary of the International Delphic Council (1994–2009) the appearance of a new Delphic ritual was proposed. With water ceremony from the Castalian Spring at Delphi the IDC presents this Holy Water ritual to the hosting country of Delphic Games.\n\nAt the opening ceremony of the III Delphic Games 2009 in Jeju, Kim Tae-hwan, Jeju Governor and prominent actress Go Doo-shim, the cultural ambassador of the Jeju Delphic, exhibited a combining ritual in which two waters ― from the Castalian Spring and from the lake on the peak of Mount Hallasan ― were mixed together to celebrate a successful opening.\n\nIn the future – six months prior to the Games\n– a Kastalian Spring Water Ceremony will symbolise\nthe count down till the Opening next Delphic Games.\n\nEvents\n\nOn 14 March 2010 the International Delphic Council organised the Delphic Games during the Grand Finale Show at the ITB Berlin, the world's biggest exhibition in tourism. There was the Feast of Delphic Games under the motto: «Arts and Culture - an experience for all senses».\nThis event corresponds to the UNESCO initiative: «2010 - International Year for the Rapprochement of Cultures».\n\nIn a relaxed atmosphere all visitors and exhibitors had the chance to enjoy the Feast of Delphic Games at the Grand Finale Show of ITB Berlin 2010.\n\nIn addition to the celebration of the Delphic Games for the ITB Berlin in 2011, an international contest for short documentaries - the Delphic Art Movie Award 2011 - is scheduled. This was initiated by the International Delphic Council.\n\nDelphic arts and culture categories\n\nThe International Delphic Council (IDC) and the hosting nations National Delphic Council (NDC) meet together and choose the disciplines out if the Delphic arts categories as presentation programme for the Games.\n\n\nJury\n\nThe competitors presents and demonstrate their work traditionally or modern arts to make the programme attractive. The independent experts served as Judges to decide for professional work and take decision for the best price award. The Judges are specialist like art teachers, professional artist and prominent persons.\n\nPrizes and awards\n\nThe most important elements of the Games are artistic competitions the presentations and exhibitions. Exceptional artists will be honoured with special awards of the International Delphic Games such as:\n\nDelphic Medals Award - gold, silver and bronze for comparable Delphic art categories.\n\nDelphic Lyre Award - exceptional artistic individual performance as a part of a larger synthesis of the arts\n\nDelphic Laurel Award - for outstanding and incomparable artistic performances\n\nDelphic Certificate - for all active participants of the Delphic Junior Games and of the Delphic Games for adults\n\nFrom the beginning Russia played an active role in the formation of the International Delphic Movement. After 2003, many Russian websites and central mass media claimed that Russia alone has revived the Delphic idea in 2000. Despite the withdrawal of the National Delphic Council from the International Delphic Council, the Russian delegations took part in the International Delphic Games in 2007 and 2009. The illustrated Delphic calendars verify these participations.\n\n\n\n"}

Such monuments have been constructed in many parts of the world throughout history for many different reasons. The best known tradition of stone circle construction occurred across the British Isles and Brittany in the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age, with over 1000 surviving examples, including Avebury, the Ring of Brodgar and Stonehenge. Another prehistoric tradition occurred in southern Scandinavia during the Iron Age, where stone circles were built to be mortuary monuments to the dead. Outside Europe, examples of stone circles include the 6300~6900 BCE Atlit Yam in Israel and 3000~4000 BCE Gilgal Refaim nearby, and the Bronze Age monuments in Hong Kong. Stone circles also exist in a megalithic tradition located in Senegal and the Gambia.\n\nThis is an incomplete photographic list of these stone circles.\n\nSee also Aboriginal stone arrangement\nStone circles in Australia are sometimes revered as sacred sites by the Australian Aboriginal people. While often small, there are some large stones comparable to their European counterparts, particularly in Victoria. While some are small and not well attended, others are well-known, for instance the stone arrangements in Victoria at Carisbrook and Lake Bolac.\n\nAubrey Burl's gazetteer lists 1,303 stone circles in Britain, Ireland and Brittany. Most of these are found in Scotland, with 508 sites recorded. There are 316 in England; 187 in Ireland; 156 in Northern Ireland; 81 in Wales; 49 in Brittany; and 6 in the Channel Isles.\n\nAubrey Burl records six sites in the Channel Islands, four on Guernsey and two on Jersey. All six are Cist-in-Circle monuments, which are influenced by chambered tomb design. Their relationship with the stone circle tradition of Britain, Ireland and Brittany is unclear.\n\nThere are 187 stone circles in the Republic of Ireland. The vast majority of these are in County Cork, which has 103 circles. There are 20 circles in County Kerry and 11 in County Mayo.\n\nAubrey Burl lists 43 stone circles in Dumfries and Galloway: 15 in Dumfriesshire; 19 in Kirkcudbrightshire; and 9 in Wigtonshire. The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland records 49 stone circles in the region. Of these 49, 24 are listed as 'possible'; one is an 18th-century construction; and a number have been destroyed. \n\nThe Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland records 20 stone circles in North Ayrshire, all on Arran. Five of these are listed as 'possible'. Aubrey Burrel's gazetteer records 19 stone circles on Arran. \n\nThere are two stone circles on Orkney, both on the Mainland. The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland records a possible third at Stoneyhill, also on the Mainland.\n\nThe Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland records 16 stone circles in the Scottish Borders. Of these, three are marked as 'possible'. Aubrey Burl's gazetteer lists the same number: 2 in Berwickshire; 2 in Peebleshire; 10 in Roxburghshire; and 2 in Selkirkshire.\n\nAubrey Burl's gazetteer lists seven sites in Shetland, but notes that all are dubious. The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland records three stone circles. It does not include Hjaltadans, which is instead categorised as a 'stone setting'.\n\nŌyu Stone Circles\nŌyu Stone Circles (大湯環状列石 Ōyu Kanjyō Resseki) is a late Jōmon period (approx. 2,000 – 1,500 BC) archaeological site in the city of Kazuno, Akita Prefecture, in the Tōhoku regionof northern Japan.\nThe site consists of two large stone circleslocated on an artificially flattened plateau on the left bank of the Oyu River, a tributary of the Yoneshiro River in northeastern Akita Prefecture. The site was discovered in 1931, with detailed archaeological excavations taking place in 1946, and in 1951-1952.\n\nThe larger circle, named the “Manza” circle has a diameter of 46 meters, and is the largest stone circle found in Japan. A number of reconstructions of Jomon period dwellings have been built around the site.

The Marienkirche in Lemgo, Germany was illuminated with a combination of a female bust and a pair of 12-point deer antlers. The artist behind that particular piece is unknown, but the extraordinary chandelier encouraged many other artists to create their own pieces.\n\nDuring the 16th century lusterweibchen boomed, with famous designs by artists such as Albrecht Dürer, Veit Stoss, and Tilman Riemenschneider. Lusterweibchen chandeliers may have had an almost magical appeal. reflecting the spirit of the era. The most famous lusterweibchen design was a dragon chandelier carved according to a drawing by Albrecht Dürer.\nAs part of horn furniture antlers are treasured parts for collectors and suited perfectly for decoration. The combination of antler and a carved statue created a perfect unit for decoration and room illumination. With the rising prosperity of the European middle class at the end of the 19th century, lusterweibchen became a famous design part. Artists created various designs ranging from copies of old drawings to modern noble ladies, mermaid busts, dianas, lustermaennchen, shields, and guilds.\n\n"}
{"id": "1148043", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1148043", "title": "New Zealand cuisine", "text": "New Zealand cuisine\n\nNew Zealand cuisine is largely driven by local ingredients and seasonal variations. An island nation with a primarily agricultural economy, New Zealand yields produce from land and sea. Similar to the cuisine of Australia, the cuisine of New Zealand is a diverse British-based cuisine, with Mediterranean and Pacific Rim influences as the country becomes more cosmopolitan.\n\nHistorical influences came from Māori culture. New American cuisine, Southeast Asian, East Asian, and South Asian culinary traditions have become popular since the 1970s.\n\nIn New Zealand households, dinner is the main meal of the day, when families gather and share their evening together. Restaurants and takeaways provide an increasing proportion of the diet.\n\nWhen the indigenous Māori arrived in New Zealand from tropical Polynesia they had a number of food plants, including kūmara (sweet potato), taro and tī. The plants grew well only in the north of the North Island. Native New Zealand plants such as fernroot became a more important part of the diet, along with insects such as the huhu grub. Problems with horticulture were made up for by an abundance of bird and marine life. The large flightless moa were soon hunted to extinction. Rāhui (resource restrictions) included forbidding the hunting of certain species in particular places or at certain times of year, so that the numbers could regenerate.\nLike other Polynesian people, Māori cooked food in earth ovens, known in New Zealand as hāngi, although the word \"umu\" is also used as in other Pacific languages. Stones are heated by fire and food packed in leaves are placed on top. The packs are further covered with foliage and cloth, or, wet sacks, then earth. Other cooking methods included roasting and, in geothermal areas, boiling or steaming using natural hot springs and pools. Occasionally food would be boiled in non-geothermal areas by putting hot stones into a bowl with water and the food; and some food was also cooked over the open fire. Some foods were preserved using smoke, air-drying, or layers of fat—particularly muttonbirds. Māori were one of the few people to have no form of alcoholic beverage.\n\nIn traditional Māori religion food was noa, or non-sacred. This meant care had to be taken to prevent it coming into contact with tapu places or objects. If it did, the tapu of the place or object, and often the people associated with it, would be at risk. High chiefs, and people engaged in tapu work such as tattooing, were tapu and were restricted in how they could deal with food; the most tapu needing to be fed by others. One story tells of a war party which had to be postponed as no non-tapu people were available to load the food supplies into the party's waka.\n\nWhen Europeans (Pākehā) first arrived in New Zealand from the late eighteenth century, they brought their own foods with them. Some of these, especially pork and potatoes, were quickly adopted by Māori and helped end the threat of food shortages that had long plagued many Māori tribes. Potatoes were particularly popular as they were grown in a similar way to kūmara but produced a much higher yield with less effort. Other European foods such as wheat, pumpkin, mutton, sugar, and many types of fruit also became a common part of the Māori diet. American sailors brought new varieties of kumara to New Zealand, and these high-yield varieties quickly superseded the original varieties of kumara.\n\nAlcohol, initially rejected as 'wai piro' (stinking water), also became part of Māori life. Most Māori tribes grew surpluses of food for trade with other tribes and with European visitors and settlers. Some tribes grew wealthy from this trade, although the Māori food industry declined in the mid-nineteenth century because of land loss and competition from settler farmers. Many traditional food sources, such as the kereru (wood pigeon) and other birds, as well as some types of fish and plants, became scarce as forests were destroyed and species were over-hunted.\n\nPresent day Māori cuisine is a mixture of Māori tradition, old-fashioned English cookery, and contemporary dishes. Most large Māori gatherings feature a hāngi, which is likely to contain foods brought to New Zealand by Māori and by Pākehā. In recent decades there has been much concern that Māori have picked up the worst of European eating habits and as a result are disproportionately likely to suffer from obesity, heart disease, and diabetes.\n\nTwo dishes regarded as distinctively Māori are the boil-up - of pork, potatoes, kūmara, and dumplings, and pork and puha (\"sow thistle\") which combine introduced and indigenous foods. Both dishes owe much to nineteenth century British cooking methods.\n\nAlso distinctive is \"rēwena\" or \"Maori bread\", which is made with fermented potatoes.\n\nThe majority of New Zealanders are Pākehā of British descent, so it is not surprising that the cuisine owes much to British cuisine.\n\nNineteenth-century British settlers in New Zealand tried as much as possible to reproduce the foods of their homeland. In the early stages of colonisation this was difficult as many ingredients were unavailable. Pākehā settlers ate native birds and fish, and used local ingredients in substitution for those which were unavailable, for example brewing tea and beer using unconventional plants. Most of these innovations were abandoned as the Pākehā population increased and conventional ingredients began to be mass-imported or produced in New Zealand. One innovation which was commonly served on New Zealand tables until the mid-1980s was colonial goose, a stuffed leg of lamb which substituted for goose. A major difference between British and Pākehā food was that meat was much more readily available to all social classes in New Zealand. Whereas in nineteenth century Britain, labourers ate meat in very small quantities, in New Zealand they could have it for every meal. Since meat was a high status food in Britain, British settlers in New Zealand ate vast quantities of it.\n\nLike the British, Pākehā have traditionally preferred sweet foods, and a wealth of baking dishes celebrate important occasions, reflected through cakes, scones, muffins and other mainly sweet baking dishes. The country's most iconic recipe book, the \"Edmonds Cookery Book\", originally began as publicity material for a baking powder company, and contains a high proportion of baking recipes.\n\nFor most of the twentieth century, New Zealand cuisine remained highly derivative of British food. From about the 1960s, the advent of affordable air travel allowed New Zealanders to travel overseas more easily. Many New Zealanders went to Europe on overseas experience where they encountered French and Italian cooking, and also the Indian and Chinese restaurants of Britain as well as the New British cuisine. When they returned home they helped create a demand for better quality food and more variety. They also tried to discover what New Zealand cuisine was, experimenting with hangi and gaining a greater appreciation of New Zealand produce.\n\nThe United Kingdom's joining of the European Economic Community (EEC) (now the European Union) in 1973 sounded the death knell of New Zealand's identity as an agricultural producer for the British Isles, and the formal cultural ties, including cuisine, with the United Kingdom started to become diluted. During this period, certain non-British or Irish European dishes, such as beef bourguignon, had shed the 'ethnic' connotation and entered the mainstream New Zealand cooking.\n\nThe 1980s was marked with economic liberalisation dubbed Rogernomics (named for the then Minister of Finance, Roger Douglas) that abolished farm subsidies, forcing many farmers to find alternative means of survival. Many chose to produce specialty cheese types like Havarti, Brie and Stilton, or diversified into growing olives or grapes instead of traditional meat and dairy farming. Avocado oil for cooking was commercialised in New Zealand in 1999 by a group of growers based in the Tauranga region.\n\nRogernomics also abolished much of import tariffs and instituted a more relaxed agricultural product import quarantine regime. This allows hereunto prohibited or prohibitively expensive specialty foods, such as genuine serrano ham from Spain, extra virgin olive oil from Italy, and mango from Thailand, to be available in New Zealand at reasonable costs. These two developments from Rogernomics have given birth to a proliferation of specialist food products available in New Zealand.\n\nOn top of changes in available ingredients, the 1980s also witnessed a wholescale liberalisation in attitude towards the formerly 'foreign muck' cooking styles and segmentation of lifestyles according to income and socio-economic status. New Zealand had by this time developed a largely distinct cultural outlook away from the British Isles, and this also made foreign cooking styles more acceptable among the general public. The same era also saw the moneyed populations feeling free to openly emulate the luxurious eating and drinking habits of upper and upper middle classes overseas, as the traditional New Zealand preference of egalitarianism, manifested in widespread prejudice against any deviation from lower middle class lifestyles, waned in influence. In the words of New Zealand-based anthropologist David Veart, this period of seachange in New Zealand's culinary culture was akin to \"being let out after a long school detention\".\n\nPeople from many different backgrounds have settled in New Zealand, and many have tried to reproduce their native cuisines or national dishes in New Zealand. Similar to early Pākehā settlers, this often proved difficult. Larger ethnic groups, such as the Chinese, were able to import some ingredients, but often dishes had to be modified to use local ingredients. Ethnic restaurants have served as community meeting places and have also given other New Zealanders a chance to try different cuisines. However, for most of its history there were few ethnic restaurants in New Zealand other than inauthentic Chinese, Indian and Italian eateries.\n\nThe Immigration Act 1986 completely abolished nationality preference for immigration, and immigration from East Asia, Southeast Asia and South Asia has skyrocketed since. Many of these immigrants have brought their different cuisines to New Zealand, and often opened ethnic restaurants and takeaway eateries, giving New Zealanders a chance to try more authentic editions of Japanese, Thai, Malay, regional Chinese, Indian, and other Asian cuisines. Over time these ethnic cuisines have been gradually accepted by Pākehā and Māori New Zealanders. Consequently, most New Zealand cities have a wide variety of ethnic restaurants, and foods such as kebabs, couscous, and sushi are served virtually everywhere. Many ethnic origin dishes have been willingly adopted by New Zealanders as their own, including sushi, antipasto, butter chicken, pad thai, pasta, such that they appear in home cooking, as well as in generic New Zealand restaurants.\n\nIngredients for many ethnic dishes have become much easier to find in major cities, mostly through speciality or ethnic food stores started by many of the post-1987 migrants to New Zealand, but in some cases also through mainstream New Zealand supermarket chains. Similar to Australia, in time the increasing availability of ingredients gave birth to a more authentic style of ethnic cooking, and some ethnic food ingredients have been adopted for local cooking: ingredients such as extra virgin olive oil and sun dried tomatoes, and to a lesser extent fish sauce and rice paper were already seen as ordinary ingredients by the year 2000, whereas even by the late 1980s many people would still have regarded them as highly exotic.\n\nAs a result of various developments, the food scene of New Zealand in the early 21st century is in a state of flux: cosmopolitan Pacific Rim fare's reign is now the norm in much of metropolitan eating out scenes, and traditional hearty settlers food, now dubbed \"Kwisine Kiwiana\", but reinterpreted through Pacific Rim cooking knowledge, is a popular cooking style for eating out scenes even in the most remote rural regions. Most of the home cooking prepared at households in Auckland is now a mix of traditional Kiwiana dishes heavily modified by Mediterranean and Asian techniques and ingredients, and adapted versions of Mediterranean, Chinese, and Indian dishes. In the more culturally traditional parts of the country, such as rural Canterbury and the West Coast, however, traditional Kiwiana fare is still the norm at many homes.\n\nCertain vestiges of traditional Kiwiana dishes remain popular throughout the country, such as fish and chips, meat pies, custard squares, pavlova, and others. An active nostalgia movement supports the traditional Kiwiana cuisine, as spreadheaded by the popularity of television series Kiwi Kitchen presented by Richard Till, which is believed to be a public response to a common perception that the traditional Kiwiana dishes are disappearing from the New Zealand tables. Home baking is particularly believed to be the last bastion of New Zealand cuisine still unaffected by international trends.\n\nConcurrently, food habits are changing in Australia to lighter fares influenced by the Mediterranean, and subsequently Southeast Asian, styles of cooking. The proximity, common history, and strong modern political, economic, cultural, and family ties between the two countries means many New Zealand diners and chefs have always been well informed of the trends in the Australian dining scene. Many chefs had worked in Australia and endeavour to learn from their trans-Tasman counterparts, and in time the changing Australian culinary scene has trickle-down effects on the New Zealand cuisine as well.\n\nIn general, there are minimal differences between the food preference of New Zealand and Australia. The food trends in New Zealand tend to trail its trans-Tasman counterparts by a few years to a decade, such as the Mediterranean cookery did not become mainstream in New Zealand until the dawn of the 1990s, while its influence was already felt in Australia by the 1980s; and while Australia has by the early 21st century developed a well established niche specialist produce distributing channel, a similar system is still in its infancy across the Tasman. However, in recent times Auckland and Wellington have food fashions moving essentially in sync with that of Sydney and Melbourne.\n\nOne major recent development in the food scene is the emergence of a genuine cafe culture and disappearance of the traditional institution of tearooms at large. Before the 1990s, tearooms proliferated throughout the country offering cream tea, with scones, cream, and cucumber sandwiches, muffins, and custard squares, with filtered coffee or tea as drinks. New Zealanders have copied the Australian habits of adopting Mediterranean practice of drinking espresso derived coffees. In time, cafes became wildly popular and many tearoom owners converted their businesses to cafes. Cream tea has gone out of fashion in the contemporary New Zealand dining scene, and scones are baked at homes rather than served in eateries.\n\nVegetarianism had been regarded as an alternative lifestyle for many years; but became more mainstream during the 1980s even though consistent vegetarians are still rare. Despite exhortations by the Ministry of Health and their allies for people to eat less meat, and more cereals, fruits, and vegetables, a highly meat-based diet remains a part of New Zealand culture, albeit with decrease of red meat consumption and intake of fish and chicken has been on the rise.\n\nGluten free foodstuffs have become part of the dietary trends in New Zealand, with cafes and restaurants increasingly offering gluten free versions of popular foods such as cakes, pizza, and hamburger buns. Some supermarkets, delicatessens and bakeries similarly offer gluten free products and there has been a rise in specialty stores.\n\nA number of organic raw food operations have developed in the last decade in the major cities.\n\nNew Zealand cuisine has made minor impacts on the world at large, although Australia does feel influences from New Zealand cuisine, with certain renowned chefs such as Iain Hewitson, Justin North, Ben Shewry and Philip Johnson being New Zealand-born and Stephanie Alexander and Neil Perry actively including New Zealand culinary styles into their works. Certain personalities, such as foodie Lauraine Jacobs, baker Dean Brettschneider, and writers David Burton and Julie Biuso, are widely respected among the professional food industry around the world. The famed chef Peter Gordon of London hails from New Zealand originally. The country's most famous culinary export, the pavlova, has been the object of a decades-long battle with Australia over where it was invented.\n\nFusion cuisine and the Pacific Rim style of cooking are major cuisine styles that interact with modern New Zealand cuisine, with chefs from New Zealand actively learning overseas trends, and chefs like Peter Gordon, bakers such as Dean Brettschneider, and foodies such as Lauraine Jacobs impacting fusion and Pacific Rim cuisines from New Zealand cuisine. \"Cuisine\" magazine, first published in 1986, has earned global fame and is held in high prestige among the worldwide foodie communities.\n\nNew Zealand has a successful wine industry, with about 76 million litres being exported in the year to June 2007. The first vines are thought to have been introduced by missionary Samuel Marsden, and planted in 1817 by Charles Gordon, superintendent of agriculture for the missionaries, according to Dr Richard Smart who was viticultural editor of both editions of The Oxford Companion to Wine. Official British resident James Busby is credited with producing wine at Kerikeri in 1833, and Charles Darwin noted the winery in his diary when he visited Kerikeri in 1835.\n\nSmall vineyards were also planted by French settlers in Akaroa in the 1840s. However wine was drunk in relatively small qualities well into the twentieth century, with the average per capita consumption only about 2.6 litres in 1966. The high price of imported wines probably prevented New Zealanders from developing a taste for wine, although it did help sales of local vintages. The quality of these wines slowly improved, with New Zealand wines winning three gold and 13 silver medals at the International Wine Fair in 1963. Aided by the deregulation of the economy in the 1980s and 1990s, domestic wine consumption increased and New Zealand wine won increasing accolades internationally.\n\nThere are 10 major wine-producing areas in New Zealand, with Marlborough famed for its sauvignon blanc, Gisborne for its chardonnay, and Central Otago and Martinborough building a reputation for pinot noir and pinot gris. Hawkes Bay is known for its bold cabernets and Auckland's Waiheke Island is home to one of the top 20 cabernet blends in the world. Marlborough and Hawkes Bay are New Zealand's two premium wine-growing regions.\n\nBeer is the most popular alcoholic drink in New Zealand, accounting for 63% of available alcohol for sale. New Zealand is ranked 27th in beer consumption per capita, at around 64.7 litres per person per annum. The vast majority of beer produced in New Zealand is a type of lager, either pale or amber in colour, and between 4% – 5% alcohol by volume. \nThere are also over 100 smaller craft breweries and brewpubs producing a vast range of beer styles. The two largest breweries in New Zealand, Lion Nathan and DB Breweries, control almost 90% of sales by volume between them. New Zealand is also a leading hops producing nation with some of the most sought after hops in the world.\n\nMost New Zealanders eat their main meal – known as \"dinner\", or sometimes \"tea\" – in the evening. Most families living in one household try to eat dinner together several times a week. The formality and structure of these meals varies from family to family. Although, a few New Zealanders cook most things 'from scratch', most New Zealand home cooks are dependent to some extent on pre-made ingredients (in particular, packaged soup and sauce mixes). Cakes are very rarely made from packet mix - this has never really taken on in New Zealand. Most families eat takeaways (take-out), such as fast food, fish and chips, Chinese food, or pizza about once or twice a week. In flats (households shared by a group of unrelated young people), flatmates will generally either take turns cooking or each cook and eat individually.\n\nIn the summer, the barbecue is common, generally as a social event. Guests will usually be invited to bring beer (or wine), and on occasion meat, which the host will cook. Sometimes guests contribute a salad to the gathering instead. It is traditional for the men to cook the meat, and for the women to do everything else, although these patterns are changing. Similar Māori gatherings will often feature a hangi (pronounced \"hung-ee\"), a pit in which meats or fish are cooked with vegetables. A deep hole is dug in the ground, lined with red-hot stones and covered with vegetation. The food is then placed on top. The whole oven is sprinkled with water and sealed with more vegetation. The hole is then filled with earth and left to steam for several hours. Traditionally, men dig and prepare the hole, and women prepare the food to go in it. All members of an extended family (whanau) help out for such a feast. The occasion is relaxed, friendly and fun, with people often eating the meal under a marquee.\n\nMany New Zealand gatherings feature a custom known as 'bring a plate' or 'potluck' in which each guest will bring a plate of food to share. This allows people to host large groups without incurring serious expense. Similar customs include guests bringing salads or meat to a barbecue. Most New Zealand parties are 'BYO' (bring your own alcohol), but in this case the drinks are not usually shared. This is especially the case with parties hosted by young people, who cannot usually afford alcohol for more than a few people. One exception is sometimes the 21st birthday party, which will often be funded by the host's family. Weddings are also normally catered for by the hosts and their family.\n\nNew Zealand's eating out culture has developed strongly after the mid-1970s, thanks partially to the liberalisation of liquor licensing laws and popularisation of cafes and other similar casual dining establishments. It is common for people to visit cafes regularly for lunch or morning or afternoon snacks. On the other hand, visits to restaurants are still regarded as special occasion treats for most of the population.\n\nThere is a 'fast food' culture similar to that in the United States, Australia and Britain. Many American fast food chains have a presence in New Zealand, and local variants based on quality local produce (such as Burger Fuel and Hell Pizza for example) have arisen. The pie is possibly the nearest thing New Zealand has to street food, though its popularity has waned. Pies are actually still the most common take away lunch and are sold everywhere, in dairies, bakeries, supermarkets, petrol stations, school lunch tuck-shops. Pies can be made with beef, lamb, chicken, pork, apple, berries, rhubarb or custard. Traditionally pies are a savory food as opposed to sweet pies. A fast food chain based on pies, Georgie Pie, was founded in 1977, but went out of business in the mid-1990s after its acquisition by McDonald's New Zealand, which later brought it back as a one-off special in the early 21st century. Currently another fast food chain selling pies exists: Australian-based Jester's produces pies throughout New Zealand's North Island, predominantly Auckland.\n\nIn the main centres, food courts have become popular, with several in Auckland alone. Immigration has led to an increase in choice and quality, with many food halls offering Asian cuisines including Thai, Indian, Turkish, Malaysian, Japanese and Chinese, as well as distinctly New Zealand fare such as roast dinners.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8768976", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8768976", "title": "Plastic Paddy", "text": "Plastic Paddy\n\nPlastic Paddy is a sometimes pejorative term for members of the Irish diaspora who misappropriate stereotypical aspects of Irish customs and identity. Sometimes the adopted imagery is not only inaccurate, but seen as offensive by members of Irish cultures. The term has also been applied to those with distant, or zero, ancestral connection to Ireland who falsely claim Irish identity or nationality. A \"plastic Paddy\" may know little of actual Irish culture, but nevertheless assert an Irish identity. The term is pejoratively used to refer to people on the basis of their perceived lack of authenticity as Irish.\n\nThe name Paddy is a diminutive form of the Irish name Patrick (\"Pádraic\", \"Pádraig\", \"Páraic\") and, depending on context, can be used either as an affectionate or a pejorative reference to an Irishman.\n\nThe term \"plastic Paddy\" came into use in the 1980s when it was frequently employed as a term of abuse by recently arrived middle-class Irish migrants to London. Hickman states: it 'became a means of distancing themselves from established Irish communities.' And the use was a part of the process by which the second-generation Irish are positioned as inauthentic within the two identities, of Englishness and Irishness.\n\nPeople who were not born in Ireland, and who did not grow up in Ireland, but nonetheless possess Irish citizenship and an Irish passport are sometimes labelled as \"plastic Paddies\".\n\nThe term can have a different connotation depending on where it is used.\n\nWithin Ireland, \"plastic paddy\" may refer to someone who misrepresents the Irish culture by enacting ethnic stereotypes that portray an inaccurate, outdated and offensive image of Ireland and Irish culture. This is often seen in non-Irish citizens who have a romantic or noble savage image of \"the Irish Race,\" and those who enact stereotypes to appeal to tourists. This naming is a critical reaction to, and defiance of, the demeaning, inaccurate depictions of the Irish at celebrations that originated in the Irish diaspora, as well as the commercialisation and distortion of St. Patrick's Day.\n\nThe Killarney Active Retirement Association displayed a banner promising to \"Chase the plastic Paddy out of Ireland\" in the Kerry 2005 St Patrick's Day celebrations, and Irish journalists have used the term to characterise Irish bars in the diaspora as inauthentic and with the \"minimum of plastic paddy trimmings.\"\n\n\"Plastic paddy' has also be used as a derogatory term for Irish people who show more allegiance to English culture than Irish culture, such as those who support English football teams. First generation Irish-English model Erin O'Connor was called a \"plastic Paddy\" in Ireland due to her parents' choice of forename and non-Irish birth despite them both being Irish citizens.\n\nMary J. Hickman writes that \"plastic Paddy\" was a term used to \"deny and denigrate the second-generation Irish in Britain\" in the 1980s, and was \"frequently articulated by the new middle-class Irish immigrants in Britain, for whom it was a means of distancing themselves from established Irish communities.\" According to Bronwen Walter, Professor of Irish Diaspora Studies at Anglia Ruskin University, \"the adoption of a hyphenated identity has been much more problematic for the second generation Irish in Britain. The Irish-born have frequently denied the authenticity of their Irish identity, using the derogatory term \"plastic Paddy\", and the English regard them as \"assimilated\" and simply \"English.\"\n\nThe term has been used to taunt non-Irish born players who choose to play for the Republic of Ireland national football team, fans of Irish teams, who are members of supporters clubs outside Ireland, and other Irish individuals living in Great Britain. A study by the University of Strathclyde and Nil by Mouth found the term was used abusively on Celtic and Rangers supporters' Internet forums in reference to Celtic supporters and the wider Catholic community in Scotland. In August 2009, a man from Birmingham, England, received a suspended sentence after making derogatory comments to a police officer, who was of Irish origin. The prosecutor said the man had made racist remarks about the officer, including accusations that the officer was a \"plastic Paddy\".\n\nIn the book \"Why I Am Still a Catholic: Essays in Faith and Perseverance\" by Peter Stanford, the television presenter Dermot O'Leary describes his upbringing as \"classic plastic Paddy\", where he would be \"bullied in a nice way\" by his own cousins in Wexford for being English \"until anyone else there called me English and then they would stick up for me.\"\n\nIn \"Spiked\", Brendan O'Neill uses the term to refer to \"second-generation wannabe\" Irishmen, and writes that some of those guilty of \"plastic Paddyism\" (or, in his words, \"Dermot-itis\") are Bill Clinton, Daniel Day-Lewis, and Shane MacGowan.\n\nPlastic Paddy is typically used in a derogatory fashion towards those who identify as Irish Americans or who celebrate \"Irishness\" on Saint Patrick's Day, accusing them of having little actual connection to Irish culture. For example, British mixed martial arts fighter Dan Hardy has called American fighter Marcus Davis a \"plastic Paddy\" due to Marcus' enthusiasm for his Irish ancestry.\n\nAlex Massie, a Scottish journalist, wrote in \"National Review\":\n\n\n"}

It has a large 16-pointed Sun which symbolizes the Republic of Turkey in the center, which is surrounded by 16 five-pointed stars, symbolizing the 16 Great Turkish Empires in history. \n\nThe roots of the Presidential Seal and Presidential Flag of Turkey go back to September 1922, when a similar flag was used on the automobile that took Mustafa Kemal Atatürk to İzmir during the final days of the Turkish National Campaign. This flag is currently on display at the Anıtkabir Museum in Ankara. The Presidential Flag's characteristics and proportions were legalized with the \"Sancak Talimatnamesi\" law on October 22, 1925. According to this law, the Presidential Seal's dimensions were defined as \"70cm x 70cm\", while the Sun in the center (which looked similar to the current one) was a 20-pointed star containing 10 sharp-edged and 10 oval-edged light rays. The \"70cm x 70cm\" dimensions of the Presidential Seal were maintained in the Turkish Flag Law of May 29, 1936; but were later reduced to \"30cm x 30cm\" with a new legal amendment that was made on September 14, 1937. The number of the light rays in the Sun of the Presidential Seal were reduced to 16 (8 long and 8 short light rays, all of them sharp-edged) in order to symbolize the 16 Turkic states in history, with another legal amendment on February 18, 1978. The seal and flag took their current shape and proportions with the final legal amendment on January 25, 1985.\n\nThe \"16 Great Turkic Empires\" are a Pan-Turkist concept introduced in 1969 by Akib Özbek. Its association with the seal was introduced in 1985, under president Kenan Evren. Prior to this assertion, the 16 stars had been taken as representing sixteen medieval beyliks which succeeded the Seljuk Empire.\n\nThe 16 stars are aligned with a 22.5 degree angle, equidistantly surrounding the sun. One edge of each star points to the center of the sun. The unit of measurement of the seal is the diameter of the circle around the edges of any one of the 16 stars (A).

By this process, two vowels near each other – one long, one short – switch their lengths, so that the long one becomes short, and the short one becomes long.\n\nIn theory, the definition includes both\nand\nbut Ancient Greek, which the term was originally created to describe, displays only the former, since the process is part of long-vowel shortening.\n\nIn the Attic and Ionic dialects of Ancient Greek, \"ēo\" and \"ēa\" often exchange length, becoming \"eō\" and \"eā\".\n\nThis quantitative metathesis is more accurately described as one form of long-vowel shortening. Usually if quantitative metathesis affects a word, other kinds of shortening do as well, in the forms where quantitative metathesis cannot occur:\n\n\nIn general, the vowels affected by this shortening were separated by the Proto-Indo-European semivocalic versions of \"u\" or \"i\", usually deleted in later Greek: \"w\" (written ϝ or υ̯ ) or \"y\" (written ι̯ ).\n\nThe Homeric form of the genitive singular in the masculine first declension sometimes undergoes quantitative metathesis:\n\n\nThe Attic genitive singular Πηλεΐδ-ου \"Pēleḯd-ou\" uses a copy of the second-declension ending, which came from the same original form as the Thessalian Aeolic ending \"-oio\" (used in Homer) — \"o-syo\", thematic vowel \"o\" and case-ending \"-syo\"). The Homeric form comes from the same case ending, with the first-declension pseudo-thematic vowel \"ā\".\n\nNouns in a small subclass of the second declension (known as the \"Attic declension\") lengthen the \"o, oi\" of the ending to \"ō, ōi\". Sometimes this is quantitative metathesis:\n\nBut sometimes, when a long vowel occurs in the ending, \"ē\" is shortened to \"e\" without an accompanying lengthening of the vowel in the ending (but \"ou\" changes to \"ō\" to follow the other forms):\n\nSome third-declension nouns had, in Proto-Indo-European, stems in \"-u\" or \"-i\" in zero-grade, \"-ew\" or \"-ey\" in short e-grade, and \"-ēw\" or \"-ēy\" in long \"ē\"-grade. Others had \"-āw\" with no variation in ablaut grade, which changed in some forms to \"ēw\", by the Attic-Ionic \"ā\" → \"ē\" shift.\n\nIn many cases, the \"w\" or \"j\" was deleted, but sometimes it is preserved as the last element of a diphthong (\"-eus\", \"-aus\").\n\nStems with \"ē\" underwent shortening in Classical Attic-Ionic, but early forms with long ē are preserved in Homer to maintain the original meter. Some forms exemplify the quantitative-metathesis type of shortening:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe accent of the genitive singular of the last two words violates the rules of accentuation. Normally the long vowel of the last syllable would force the accent forward to the second-to-last syllable, giving *πολέως \"*poléōs\" and *ἀστέως \"*astéōs\", but instead the accent remains where it was before shortening.\n\nOther forms of these nouns shorten \"ē\" to \"e\", but because the vowel of the ending is long, no quantitative metathesis occurs:\n\nSome forms shorten \"ē\" to \"e\" before \"i\" according to the analogue of the other forms, but without lengthening the \"i\":\n\nOther forms involve no shortening, since they come from a short \"e\"-grade form of the stem. The accent of the genitive plural is sometimes irregular because it follows the analogue of the genitive singular:\n\n\nThe perfect participle of the verb θνῄσκω \"thnēískō\" \"die\" undergoes vowel shortening, and quantitative metathesis in the oblique forms:\n\n"}
{"id": "31552371", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31552371", "title": "Reverence (emotion)", "text": "Reverence (emotion)\n\nReverence () is \"a feeling or attitude of deep respect tinged with awe; veneration\". The word \"reverence\" in the modern day is often used in relationship with religion. This is because religion often stimulates the emotion through recognition of God, the supernatural, and the ineffable. Reverence involves a humbling of the self in respectful recognition of something perceived to be greater than the self. Thus religion is commonly a place where reverence is felt.\n\nHowever, similar to awe, reverence is an emotion in its own right, and can be felt outside of the realm of religion. Whereas awe may be characterized as an overwhelming \"sensitivity to greatness,\" reverence is seen more as \"acknowledging a subjective response to something excellent in a personal (moral or spiritual) way, but qualitatively above oneself\" Solomon describes awe as passive, but reverence as active, noting that the feeling of awe (i.e., becoming awestruck) implies paralysis, whereas feelings of reverence are associated more with active engagement and responsibility toward that which one reveres. Nature, science, literature, philosophy, great philosophers, leaders, artists, art, music, wisdom, and beauty may each act as the stimulus and focus of reverence.\n\nDavid Pugmire’s article, \"The Secular Reception of Religious Music\" explores the unique experience of reverence through music. In particular he looks at how religious music has the capacity to instill emotions of reverence, awe, wonder, and veneration in secular people who lack the context to fully understand the transcendent through religion. \"Sacred music seems to have a surprising power over unbelievers not just to quicken or delight them as other music does, but also to ply them, as little else can, with what might be called devotional feelings\". Even with this though, Pugmire argues that the secularist cannot fully comprehend the nature of sacred art including sacred music. \"Its undoubted expressiveness can lead him at most to accesses of feeling, not to emotion in the fullest sense, i.e., emotion with appropriate objects sustained by appropriate judgments\".\n\nPugmire believes that reverence belongs to the range of emotions that can be classified in their devotional or sacred forms, \"Emotions of reverence, solemnity, agape, hope, serenity, and ecstasy\". But this classification of emotions poses an interesting question: can any emotion be purely religious? \"A central candidate for a distinctively religious emotion would be reverence\". But it is not entirely distinct from the rest of the emotions that are not related to transcendence or religion. \"Reverence is indeed graver, and an attitude in which one is more given over, than its secular approximations in the shape of approval or esteem or respect\". But this does not make it purely religious. In fact, \"Kant was able to claim reverence as our principal moral emotion without invoking any grounding theological basis for this\". \"Similarly for its bracing sibling, awe: it figures in our experience of the sublime, of which Kant purports to find an entirely secular account\". To connect the secular and the sacred emotions Pugmire looks at the emotions which can be experienced equally in both contexts. These are, \"Love, humility, sorrow, pity, joy, serenity, ecstasy\". Pugmire then suggests that devotional emotion is: \"The transfiguring of mundane emotion into what one might call emotion of the last instance, to the reception and expression of which religious imagery is especially well-suited, and not accidentally\". The emotion of the last instance refers to the capacity of the emotional imagination to lose the sense of self and engage in the infinite and the ineffable. Pugmire is suggesting that religion, \"Provides a strikingly apt vocabulary for the expression of emotion of the last instance\". Reverence is perhaps the most critical of these \"emotions of the last instance\" and can be adequately accessed through religious music.\n\nPaul Woodruff in his book, \"Reverence: Renewing a Forgotten Virtue\", assesses the current understanding of the emotion reverence in the modern era. He assesses that a true understanding of reverence is missing from both modern society and the \"modern discussions of the ancient cultures that prized it\" (Woodruff, p. 3). Specifically these ancient cultures include Greece and China. Woodruff’s best definition of Reverence is, \"The well-developed capacity to have the feelings of awe, respect, and shame when these are the right feelings to have\" (Woodruff, p. 8). Thus Woodruff’s definition of reverence includes the combination of three other emotions: respect, shame, and awe. \"Respect is for other people, shame is over one’s own shortcomings, and awe is usually felt toward something transcendent\" (Woodruff, p. 65).\nAlthough Woodruff acknowledges the relationship between reverence and religion he argues that, \"Reverence has more to do with politics than with religion\" (Woodruff, p. 4). Woodruff in his book is trying to separate the common misunderstanding that reverent emotions can only be related to religion.\n\nWoodruff sees ceremony and ritual as key elements in meaningful human life when practiced with reverence. \"Without reverence, rituals are empty\" (Woodruff, p. 19). Ceremony and ritual are found at home, in meetings, in voting, and in religion and these acts provide the context for feeling reverence. But often these situations are so common the emotion reverence disappears from human consciousness. \"Ritual and reverence in common life are so familiar that we scarcely notice them until they are gone\" (Woodruff, p. 35). Woodruff argues that, \"Reverence, ceremony and respect do not disappear, they cannot disappear from a functioning society\" (Woodruff, p. 36). He states that \"What we are losing is not reverence, but the idea of reverence\" (Woodruff, p. 36). It is his hope that the importance of reverence will be recognized in society again and that this recognition will better humanity. He proposes to \"Restore the idea of reverence to its proper place in ethical and political thought\" (Woodruff, p. 38).\n\nWoodruff understands true reverence to be for things beyond human control. \"The object of reverence is the ideal of unity, because that transcends politics altogether\" (Woodruff, p. 28). Thus reverence focuses on an ideal that transcends the scope of humankind. This ideal can vary from God, to unity, to anything else that transcends human capacity. \"Reverence sets a higher value on the truth than on any human product that is supposed to have captured the truth\" (Woodruff, p. 39). He goes on to say that, \"The principal object of reverence is Something that reminds us of human limitations\" (Woodruff, p. 65). Reverence therefore is related to truth and the recognition that mankind cannot acquire absolute truth and that human life is finite.\n\nWoodruff describes how reverence is often activated through music. Woodruff claims that \"Reverence cannot be expressed in a creed; its most apt expression is in music\" (Woodruff, p. 123). He gives the analogy of a quartet of varying skill levels playing a piece by Mozart. They embody reverence because: \"(1) The musicians have been engaged, more or less harmoniously, on a project as a group; (2) their project involved ceremony; (3) they have felt themselves largely without ego; (4) they have felt themselves to be part of a clearly defined hierarchy that was painless for all of them; and (5) they have achieved in the end a shared feeling of inarticulate awe\" (Woodruff, p. 48-49). This coincides with his belief that \"Art speaks the language of reverence better than philosophy does, and speak(s) it to the reverence that is already in the town\" (Woodruff, p. 25). By \"in the town\" Woodruff is referring to the recognition of reverence that is already present.\n\n\"In the presence of death we expect ourselves and others to be reverent; the expectation feels natural, and yet the ceremonies through which we express reverence at such times take very different forms in different cultures\" (Woodruff, p. 50). In his conversation on funerals as times of reverence he makes the point that reverence transcends faith and that it is constant throughout human history even when religions change (Woodruff, p. 54.). \"You need not believe in God to be reverent, but to develop an occasion for reverence you must share a culture with others, and this must support a degree of ceremony\" (Woodruff, p. 50). Reverence is not dependent on religion, but true religious experience is dependent on the emotion reverence.\n\nPaul Woodruff builds his case on reverence by analyzing the historical significance of reverence as a virtue. In Ancient Greek and Chinese civilizations, \"Both cultures celebrate reverence in the belief that it is reverence above all that maintains social order and harmony\" (Woodruff, p. 60). For the Greeks reverence was rooted in mythology. \"Protagoras invented a myth in which the highest god gave reverence and justice to human beings as means for the survival of society\" (Woodruff, p. 57). This foundation was critical because \"Emotions affect action; they are motivators\" (Woodruff, p. 62). Reverence in classical Greek society then motivated the populous to act rightly and be humble to improve society. \"We feel awe for what we believe is above us all as human beings, and this feeling helps us to avoid treating other human beings with contempt\" (Woodruff, p. 63).\n\nWoodruff uses the Greek heroes and Athenian tragedies to illustrate his conception of reverence. He uses the story of Croesus by Herodotus to help shape an understanding of reverence that includes respect for those lower in hierarchical status. \"A reverent soul listens to other people even when they are inferior; that is a large part of remembering that you are human together with them\" (Woodruff, p. 83). He also illustrates reverence with the Iliad, Antigone, Pentheus, Pericles, Socrates, Plato, Oedipus, and the Odyssey. Through these figures he shows that reverence was quite significant in Greek culture. In Oedipus, Woodruff asserts that, \"Hubris is best understood simply as the opposite of reverence, in action or attitude\" (Woodruff, p. 91).\n\nAfter building his case with a look at classical Greek culture he looks at classical Chinese Confucian society. \"Filial piety expresses reverence within the family\" (Woodruff, p. 103). The most important part of his connection between reverence and the Chinese is his understanding of li. \"Li refers also to civility or reverence\" (Woodruff, p. 105). One interesting connection between Greek and Chinese societies is that, \"Both conceptions of reverence blossom with the passing away of polytheism and the rise of agnosticism. Reverence survives and flourishes in these circumstances because it is something that human beings need in order to face the most obvious, common, and inevitable facts of human life – family, hierarchy, and death\" (Woodruff, p. 110). Most of his information on reverence in Chinese culture derives from the Analects. Woodruff believes that a break in tradition is not necessarily irreverent and that relativism is flawed. People should be critical of all cultures and forms of reverence (Woodruff, p. 155).\n\nAbraham Maslow in his significant work, \"Religions, Values, and Peak-Experiences\", deals extensively with reverence. Reverence is critical in having a peak-experience. He makes the case that peak-experiences happen for the religious and non-religious alike and that they are critical to having a fulfilling life. For Maslow the distinction between the secular and the profane is unfortunate. Maslow points out that, \"Religionizing only one part of life secularizes the rest of it\". Maslow contends that religion seeks to make the emotion reverence possible through ritual, but that the familiarity of it often negates any reverent feelings. In defining peak-experiences Maslow states that, \"Such emotions as wonder, awe, reverence, humility, surrender, and even worship before the greatness of the experience are often reported\". Reverence therefore is a key ingredient in the peak-experiences that make life worth living and make mankind feel fully human.\n\nAlbert Schweitzer, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize and holder of four PhD degrees, sought for years for the basis of a new worldview. One day, while in a boat on the river in Gabon, it struck him with great force and clarity: \"Reverence for life\" (In German: Ehrfurcht vor dem Leben).\n\nEmpirical studies on reverence are scarce. However, one intriguing study on reverence is, \"Prayer and reverence in naturalistic, aesthetic, and socio-moral contexts predicted fewer complications following coronary artery bypass,\" conducted by Ai \"et al.\" (2009). These researchers looked at reverence following a coronary artery bypass. Ai \"et al.\" (2009) examined a \"sense of reverence in religious and secular contexts\" by interviewing 177 patients. Specifically they were investigating the faith-health relationship and seeking to find if religious forms of reverence practiced through faith and prayer yielded similar results to secular forms of reverence in patient recovery. Ai \"et al.\" (2009)state that, \"Because reverence includes an affective as well as a cognitive component, we see it as a form of positive feeling/emotion associated with injection of the sacred into various worldviews\". These positive emotions were believed to help in patient recovery. The first finding of Ai \"et al.\" (2009) was consistent with other research that found \"Positive influences of traditional religious involvement on health outcomes\". The second finding of Ai \"et al.\" (2009) was the \"Positive effect of secular reverence on postoperative no-complication\". From this Ai \"et al.\" (2009) inferred that, \"The capacity to sense reverence in significant naturalistic, moralistic, and aesthetic contexts seems to enhance recovery following bypass\". Strangely, \"Religious reverence did not have the same beneficial effect as secular reverence on bypass recovery\". This inconsistency suggests that more research needs to be done on reverence in patient recovery.\n\nKeltner and Haidt’s extensive study on awe focuses on the importance of vastness and accommodation in experiencing awe. \"Vastness refers to anything that is experienced as being much larger that the self\". Accommodation refers to the \"Process of adjusting mental structures that cannot assimilate a new experience\". Their research on awe, which is a part of reverence, and how it is experienced through moral, spiritual, and aesthetic means, sheds light on the greater understanding of reverence. Their study also consists of a comprehensive summary on what has been \"Written about awe in religion, philosophy, sociology, and psychology\" and their own addition of \"Related states such as admiration, elevation, and the epiphanic experience\".\n\nHaidt (2000) notes that since Maslow (1964) studied the changes that actualizing experiences can bring about in people's identities and in their moral and spiritual lives, little empirical research has been done to examine the peak experiences and moral transformations associated with positive moral emotions such as gratitude, elevation, awe, admiration, and reverence. Haidt’s own work in these areas suggests that potent feelings of reverence may be associated with the peak experiences accompanying moral transformations, where, \"Powerful moments of elevation sometimes seem to push a mental ‘reset button,’ wiping out feelings of cynicism and replacing them with feelings of hope, love, and optimism, and a sense of moral inspiration.\" \n\nGreat artists in the creation of their art sometimes give concrete form to the culturally derived beliefs, values, and group identities that provide meaning and purpose to existence. Moreover, reverence for artwork that instantiates these central aspects of culture can provide a means of buffering the existential anxiety that follows from reminders of the inevitability of human mortality. Across history, cultures have revered art as a \"forum for representing in an enduring medium those individuals who are held up as embodiments of virtue and lasting significance.\" \n\nThomas and Schlutsmeyer in, \"A Place for the Aesthetic in Experiential Personal Construct Psychology,\" look at reverence through the lens of experiential personal construct psychology (EPCP). Leitner & Pfenninger, in 1994, theorized this form of psychology in \"Sociality and optimal functioning.\" Under this umbrella of psychology, \"Reverence felt in meaningful interpersonal connectedness is one starting point for the development of a larger sense of connection with the world and the many others (human and nonhuman) in it\". This is referred to as transpersonal reverence.\nThomas and Schlutsmeyer make the case for reverence in therapy: \"In EPCP, reverence, as we stated earlier, is a goal of therapy, a sign of optimal functioning\". The therapist must revere the patient and the patient must learn to revere others and themselves in order for the therapy to be effective.\n\n\"Above all things, reverence yourself.\" Pythagoras\n\n\"Let parents bequeath to their children not riches, but the spirit of reverence.\" Plato\n\n\"We know reverence first hand wherever we are truly at home.\" Paul Woodruff\n\n\"Reverence does not die with mortals, nor does it perish whether they live or die.\" Sophocles\n\n\"He that will have his son have a respect for him and his orders must have a great reverence for his son.\" John Locke\n\n\"Reverence for Human Worth, earnest devout search for it and encouragement of it, loyal furtherance and obedience to it: this, I say, is the outcome and essence of all true \"religions,\" and was and ever will be.\" Thomas Carlyle\n\n\"In this world there is one godlike thing, the essence of all that was or ever will be of godlike in this world: the veneration done to Human Worth by the hearts of men.\" Thomas Carlyle\n\n\"I love and reverence the Word, the bearer of the spirit, the tool and gleaming ploughshare of progress.\" Thomas Mann\n\n\"Pursue some path, however narrow and crooked, in which you can walk with love and reverence.\" Henry David Thoreau\n\n\"By having a reverence for life, we enter into a spiritual relation with the world. By practicing reverence for life we become good, deep, and alive.\" Albert Schweitzer\n\n\"Gratitude bestows reverence, allowing us to encounter everyday epiphanies, those transcendent moments of awe that change forever how we experience life and the world.\" John Milton\n\n\"Who is to decide what ought to command my reverence--my neighbor or I? . . You can't have reverence for a thing that doesn't command it. If you could do that, you could digest what you haven't eaten, and do other miracles and get a reputation.\" Mark Twain, a Biography \n\n\"Fullness of knowledge always means some understanding of the depths of our ignorance; and that is always conducive to humility and reverence.\" Robert Millikan\n\n\"The roots, or common principles of human morality are to be found in moral feelings such as commiseration, shame, respect, and reverence.\" Wing-Tsit Chan \n\n\"Juvenal said that the greatest reverence is due the young (14.47), deliberately reversing the tradition that directs reverence ever upward.\" Paul Woodruff\n\n\"Reverence for truth leads to humility in the face of the awesome task of getting something right\" Paul Woodruff\n\n\"Reverence in the classroom calls for a sense of awe in the face of the truth and a recognition by teachers and students of their places in the order of learning.\" Paul Woodruff\n\n\"In Memoriam\" by Tennyson. Paul Woodruff believes that Tennyson, \"gave us the finest expression of reverence that we have in the English language, \"In Memoriam\".\n\n\n"}

He was the author of the \"Index Thomisticus\", a complete lemmatization of the works of Saint Thomas Aquinas and of a few related authors. \n\nBorn in Vicenza, the second of five children, he attended primary school in Bolzano and grammar school in Verona and in Belluno. In 1928 he entered the Episcopal Seminary of Belluno, completing high school there, and took the first two-year course of Theology with Albino Luciani, the future Pope John Paul I. In 1933 he joined the Society of Jesus, where he got a diploma in Philosophy in 1937 and one in Theology in 1941 and where he was ordained priest in 1940. From 1940 till 1943 he was an auxiliary army chaplain in the National Army and later in the partisan forces. In 1946 he graduated in Philosophy at the Papal Gregorian University of Rome with a degree thesis entitled \"The Thomistic Terminology of Interiority\", which was published in 1949. He was full professor of Ontology, Theodicy and Scientific Methodology and, for some years, a librarian in the \"Aloisianum\" Faculty of Philosophy of Gallarate.\n\nIn 1946 he planned the \"Index Thomisticus\", as a tool for performing text searches within the massive corpus of Aquinas's works. In 1949 he met with Thomas J. Watson, the founder of IBM, and was able to persuade him to sponsor the \"Index Thomisticus\". The project lasted about 30 years, and eventually produced in the 1970s the 56 printed volumes of the \"Index Thomisticus\". In 1989, a CD-ROM version was produced. In addition, in 2005 a web-based version made its debut, sponsored by the Fundación Tomás de Aquino and CAEL; the design and programming of this version were carried about by E. Alarcón and E. Bernot, in collaboration with Busa. In 2006 the \"Index Thomisticus\" Treebank project (directed by Marco Passarotti) started the syntactic annotation of the entire corpus.\n\nThe Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO) awards the \"Busa Prize\", which honors leaders in the field of humanities computing.

The oldest written secular music are songs with Latin lyrics. However, many secular songs were sung in the vernacular language, unlike the sacred songs that followed the Latin language of the Church. These earliest types were known as the chanson de geste (song of deeds) and were popular amongst the traveling jongleurs and minstrels of the time.\n\nThe largest collection of secular music from this period comes from poems of celebration and chivalry of the troubadours from the south of France. These poems contain clever rhyme-schemes, varied use of refrain-lines or words, and different metric patterns. The minstrels of this time were not themselves poets or composers. Instead they adapted the compositions of others to sing, play, and dance to in their own unique versions. Other styles included love songs, political satire, dances, chansons, and dramatic works.\n\nAccording to Grout’s A History of Western Music (1996), common musical instruments of this time period included: harps, imported to continental Europe from Ireland and Britain sometime before the ninth century; Vielle, a prototype of the Renaissance viol and modern viola with five strings, one of which was a drone, popular amongst the jongleurs to accompany their singing and recitations; Organistrum, a three-stringed instrument similar to the vielle but played by the turning of a crank, with strings ‘stopped by a set rods instead of the player’s fingers); and Psaltery, a type of zither played by plucking or ‘striking’ the strings, which frequently appears in medieval art. The most common wind instruments included both recorder and transverse style flutes; the reeded Shawms, a precursor to the oboe; trumpets and Bagpipes.\nDrums, harps, recorders, and bagpipes were the instruments of choice when performing secular music due to ease of transportation. Jongleurs and minstrels learned their trade through oral tradition.\n\nComposers like Josquin des Prez wrote sacred and secular music. He composed 86 highly successful secular works and 119 sacred pieces. Secular music also was aided by the formation of literature during the reign of Charlemagne that included a collection of secular and semi-secular songs. Guillaume de Machaut was another example of a leading composer who continued the trouvere tradition.\n\n"}
{"id": "22576725", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22576725", "title": "Surveillance art", "text": "Surveillance art\n\nSurveillance Art is the use of technology intended to record human behavior in a way that offers commentary on the process of surveillance or the technology used to surveil. Surveillance Art manifests itself in many different forms, from short films to architecture, but all have been shown to provide some type of critical response to the rise of surveillance by various authorities and the technology used to achieve it, especially when dealing with issues of security and enforcing laws.\n\nWith new technology, came new surveillance and new ways of responding to it through artistic media. With the advent of video-recording devices, closed circuit television, and digital cameras, remote surveillance of subjects became possible. One of the most popular figures to adapt these new methods of surveillance to art was Andy Warhol.\n\nWarhol’s movie, \"Outer and Inner Space\", introduced the performance-art possibilities of high-tech surveillance to the modern world. At the same time, it provided the observed subject with the image or knowledge of being observed, in this case the actress Edie Sedgwick. \"On the left, Sedgwick's video image, in full profile, gazes off to the right, looking up as if she were talking to someone standing above her. On the right, the 'real' (or 'live') Edie sits in three-quarter profile facing left, addressing someone sitting off-screen to the left of Warhol's movie camera -- an arrangement which at times creates the illusion that we are watching Sedgwick in conversation with her own image.\"\n\nIn the late twentieth century, the AIDS epidemic, cancer rates, and other health concerns created a new form of surveillance. Suddenly, the condition of the human body and potential for contagion became an addition to existing systems of observation.\n\n\"The ‘my body, my business’ ideal in the clinical setting dovetailed with broader societal concerns about snoops, spies, and surveillance, setting the stage for a fundamental recasting of the politics of surveillance in the last decades of the twentieth century. The encounter over HIV represented the high water mark of patient participation in the politics of surveillance. \"\n\nThe terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 sparked a new wave of American surveillance of the citizen body. This was primarily a form of electronic information gathering—monitoring of phones and email, Internet use, tracking and tracing of cell phones and GPS units. In certain instances, the detaining and/or monitoring of U.S. citizens of various ethnicities compounded the already growing debate on the violation of civil liberties. In July 2006, Ms. Mary DeRosa, a Senior Fellow of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, testified at a congressional hearing on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. At this point, different organizations within the United States government had been applying separate acts to monitor perceived threats of foreign agents, sometimes at cross-purposes and with varying degrees of rights violation.\n\nDeRosa stated: \"The national security agencies and their employees are charged with protecting the United States from harm. When faced with a decision about whether to take a step that invades liberties they will not always be able to judge whether it is the only way or the best way to address a problem -- or whether it is simply the easiest way.\"\n\nAs homeland security issues forced questions of the infringement of civil liberties, the response of various practitioners of surveillance art questioned the notion of privacy. In one of the most notorious cases, the price of innocence and freedom seems to be the willing sacrifice of one’s personal privacy.\n\nThe case of Hasan Elahi has also addressed new technologies in surveillance: tracking and tracing of cell phones, the capabilities of GPS technology, and worldwide Internet access by both the observer and the observed. The relationship between the watcher and the body watched becomes an impetus to the artwork itself.\n\nElahi has stated of his art: \"Both quantitative and qualitative information is incorporated into my work, and the entire process results in translations and mistranslations between the physical and the virtual, between the body politic and the singular citizen. The mutual misunderstandings that inevitably occur provide the inertial energy for the continuing activity and effectiveness of the work.\"\n\nThe latest evolution of response to surveillance systems is to become the system. New forms of biometric surveillance—such as heart rate monitors, and facial recognition software—are being utilized for personalized experiences and amusement park rides.\n\nBeyond biometrics is the integration of cybernetic technology into Surveillance Art. The Canadian filmmaker, Robert Spence, has adapted a miniature camera into his prosthetic eye. In an odd reversal, Spence has finally come full circle with the concept of Surveillance Art: ‘\"Originally the whole idea was to do a documentary about surveillance. I thought I would become a sort of super hero … fighting for justice against surveillance,\" Spence said. \"In Toronto there are 12,000 cameras. But the strange thing I discovered was that people don’t care about the surveillance cameras, they were more concerned about me and my secret camera eye because they feel that is a worse invasion of their privacy.\"\n\nOn May 3, 2008, artists Robin Hewlett and Ben Kinsley staged a simulated street scene in a Pittsburgh neighborhood when the Google Street View team came through. They named the project \"Street with a View\" which they describe as introducing \"fiction, both subtle and spectacular, into the doppelganger world of Google Street View.\" Using an array of local residents and actors, scenes included a marathon, a parade, a garage band practice, firemen rescuing a cat, and a sword fight. This was the first time that Google Street View had been used as a means of art, specifically, as surveillance art.\n\nThe Surveillance Camera Players (SCP), based in New York City and founded by Bill Brown, are one of the main innovators of this art form. This group of actors stages various plays in public spaces, their first one being Alfred Jarry’s \"Ubu Roi\" on December 10, 1996 at the 14th Street-Union Square Subway station. They have performed other famous works such as Samuel Beckett’s \"Waiting for Godot\", Edgar Allan Poe’s \"The Raven\", George Orwell’s \"1984\" and \"Animal Farm\". Their plays are staged in very public places such as subway stations, Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Washington Square Park, Union Square, and various other landmarks throughout the city. Their primary purpose is to create a public spectacle in order to get people to question the role surveillance plays in their lives. These performances may be witnessed by the public, yet the actual recordings of these performances remain inaccessible. The SCP is said to have been inspired by the anti-surveillance manifesto, \"Guerilla Programming of Surveillance Equipment,\" but state that they were not the first to stage surveillance camera theater. They state that it was the invention of comedy writers:\n\nProperly speaking, surveillance camera theater was invented by a comedy writer, not a privacy advocate or a performance artist: i.e., the person(s) who in 1981 wrote the \"On the Job\" episode of the American TV sit-com \"Taxi\", in which Alex Reiger (played by Judd Hirsch) temporarily gets a job as a camera-watching security guard. Bored by the isolation and silence, Alex eventually learns to pass the time by improvising skits in front of the surveillance camera and watching himself on the monitor at the same time. When Alex's shift is over, he is replaced by a veteran of the place (played by \"Grampa\" Al Lewis), who pulls out a ventriloquist's dummy and starts performing in front of the surveillance camera as soon as his shift begins! The implication was that every security guard—when no one (else) was looking—was passing the time in this way. On October 12, 1992, Saturday Night Live included a skit that imagined that during the night, when everyone else had gone home, the people who worked at Rockefeller Center would amuse themselves and each other by putting on little skits in front of the building's surveillance cameras. As in Taxi, none of these skits had any political content and none of them concerned privacy rights.\n\nThe SCP has a wide following around the world and has even spawned sister groups in Arizona, California, Italy, Lithuania, Sweden, and Turkey suggesting how the issue of surveillance is one which transcends nationalities and cultures, bringing people together to make one synonymous public statement.\n\nSome surveillance artists choose to use architecture as canvases. The buildings and structures they use are in highly visible areas with lots of pedestrians. The artists install a surveillance system that tracks human movement through and/or around the structure. The system is connected to a viewing format, such as a large screen or light installation, which are triggered by human movement. As one artist describes it, \"All the visual elements in the projection result from people’s movements through the space.\" Surveillance art elicits interaction from viewers while making them more aware of the pervasiveness of surveillance.\n\nSome architectural surveillance art pieces involve large screen installations or projections on highly visible buildings in populated areas. Artist Christian Moeller’s 2006 project, \"Nosy,\" includes a street-level camera which records the active surrounding environment, including pedestrians, cars, and a nearby train in Osaki City, Japan. The real-time video is \"displayed in bitmap graphics [and projected] onto three towers covered with white LEDs behind frosted glass panels.\"\nArtist Camille Utterback created a similar installation in 2007, called \"Abundance,\" using the domed city hall of San Jose, California, as her interactive canvas. The installation includes a large surveillance camera focused on pedestrians and an abstract art animation, projected onto the city hall building. Pedestrians’ location and movement within the field of the camera are translated into abstract shapes that appear in the projection. As the pedestrian moves, the corresponding shape moves within the animation and interacts with other shapes in the projection. Utterback’s website states, \"Movements and paths through the plaza become part of a collective visual record, and transform the building into a playful and dynamic canvas.\"\nThe Los Angeles-based artist team, Electroland, has been dedicated to working on interactive art projects. Many of their projects are architectural surveillance art through the use of light installations or electronic displays. One of their architectural installations, \"Enteractive,\" uses both the inside and outside of a building in Los Angeles. This project, finished in 2006, involves tracking indoor participants’ movements and locations over a large floor light grid. Outside, their real-time locations and movement patterns are broadcast to anyone within view of the colored light grid installed onto the face of the building.\nAnother of Electroland’s projects was incorporated into the Pedestrian Bridge of the Indianapolis Airport in 2008. The project, named \"Connection,\" is made up of light \"dots\" that cover the length of the bridge, which light up in different colors as people pass through. The colored dots follow people’s movements and often interact with participants, \"exhibit[ing] a range of intelligent and playful behaviors, accompanied by sounds.\" Electroland has similar projects, including Target Breezeway, Lumen, and Drive By.\nThe French art team, Hehe, also works with architectural surveillance art but they prefer to take a \"green\" approach. Like Electroland, they have also done light installations, like their 2007 project in Luxembourg, \"Grandes Lignes.\" This project includes light installations along a pedestrian footbridge that only light up where a pedestrian is located. Hehe describes the selective lighting as \"the personal light sphere, which surrounds the traveler as they move from one end to the other.\" Hehe explains the intent behind the project: \"The responsiveness of the system functions ecologically and economically – saving energy – and also metaphorically: Your shadow – of light – walks with you and follows you.\"\n\nHehe has also started a set of projects under the title, \"Pollstream,\" all of which are environmentally-focused. Of these, Nuage Vert, or \"green cloud\" in English, is architectural surveillance art. The 2008 project uses a thermo-sensitive camera and a laser with a green, cloud-shaped beam. Installed on a nearby building, the beam is projected onto the stream of pollution from a power plant in Helsinki, as a constant reminder to residents of their energy usage. Hehe’s focus in this project moves from direct surveillance of people to the surveillance of their factories and plants. Here, humans are being indirectly watched through what they produce, like air pollution. This is potentially the beginning of a move into air surveillance art.\n\nInverse surveillance, or \"sousveillance\", makes use of surveillance technology such as cameras from the perspective of the participant, allowing the object of surveillance essentially to become the subject. The term sousveillance was coined by Steve Mann, a noted media artist.\n\nTypical instances of sousveillance as art involve voluntarily recording and broadcasting one’s own activities (via webcam, for example). The expressed purpose for this, in some cases, is to take away the value of the knowledge of the artist’s whereabouts and current activity. Hasan Elahi, an interdisciplinary media artist who was falsely suspected of terrorism and detained by government authorities, has said that the goal of broadcasting his daily life is to devalue information about him since \"Intelligence agencies, regardless of who they are, all operate in a market where their commodity is information, and the reason their information has value is because no one else has access to it.\" Thus, by increasing access to the information, he is taking away the surveilling authority’s monopoly on it.\n\nThe Surveillance Studies Network is an organization that focuses on surveillance and its various effects on society, and their online journal, \"Surveillance and Society\", publishes academic articles that present different aspects of surveillance. In 2005, \"Surveillance and Society\"’s second issue of the year featured two articles that included surveillance as an art form.\n\n\"The Plays and Arts of Surveillance: Studying Surveillance as Entertainment\" by Anders Albrechtslund and Lynsey Dubbeld takes an in depth look at surveillance and the roles it plays in art and popular culture. Although Albrechtslund and Dubbeld focus on the entertainment factor of Surveillance Art, they also acknowledge its serious explorations and implications. While Surveillance Art is entertainment, the artists \"tend to focus on controversial aspects of surveillance practices or revealing the operation of surveillance technologies.\" To illustrate this point, Albrechtslund and Dubbeld specifically referenced installation artist David Rokeby. \"For instance, like several of Rokeby’s other works, ‘Sorting Daemon’ was concerned with revealing the powers of vision and surveillance, and bringing to the fore the discriminatory, judgmental classifications that computers are increasingly producing as they take over human tasks of observation and monitoring.\"\n\nIt is observed that although surveillance has been prominent in art and other forms of entertainment, it hasn’t been studied in depth by Surveillance Studies scholars. Albrechtslund and Dubbeld see a need for further exploration of this area of surveillance. Surveillance as a form of entertainment isn’t paid as much attention as it deserves because it truly is a diverse field that is continuously developing. \"The entertaining side of surveillance is a phenomenon worth studying in itself, and we expect that this type of study will contribute to an understanding of the multi-faceted nature of surveillance.\"\n\nIn article, \"Para-Sights: Multiplied Perspectives on Surveillance Research in Art Educational Spaces,\" Robert W. Sweeny, an art educator at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, questioned surveillance technologies and the role that visual arts plays with those technologies. He then raised the question of how one would handle acknowledging surveillance technologies in the classroom. He is a firm believer that \"Those involved with the visual arts might learn much from studies regarding current surveillance technologies, going beyond the boundaries of traditional research methodologies, informing practices that interrogate the dynamics of power and vision in art educational settings.\" While teaching at The Pennsylvania State University, Sweeny used one project in particular to encourage his students to reveal \"the power of the gaze\" by exploring how surveillance brings about other ways of \"seeing:\"\n\nThese students chose the museum as a space that is based in looking and the ‘male gaze’, influenced by our readings of the course text, \"Ways of Seeing\" (Berger, 1972). Doubling the gaze of the surveillance camera through hand held video, then recording the individual recording the camera, they created a layered experience that lead to confusion. Through a tight editing process, they constantly reminded the viewer of the position of the camera operator (and the apparent laxness of the security guard) through the rapidly shifting camera shots. The images begin to break up as filmed image was filmed, layered with music that approached noise, only to return to a calm denouement, backing out of the doors that introduced the walking protagonist into a panoptic hall of mirrors.\nWith this project, the students not only created Surveillance Art, but by becoming the watchers, or what Sweeny would call the parasite, they were able to see beyond the environment that the museum created with its own surveillance cameras.\n\nIn his essays, interactive artist David Rokeby writes about the control and subjectivity that is created by artists who use technologies such as cameras:\n\nThe expressive power of the interface, in conjunction with the increasing 'apparent' transparency of interface technologies raises complicated ethical issues regarding subjectivity and control. Interactive artists are in a position to take the lead in generating a discussion of these concerns, but, on the other hand, are also in danger of becoming apologists for industrial, corporate, and institutional uses of these technologies.\nRokeby has also written an essay for students who wish to create interactive art and he goes on to explain his perspective on the pieces he creates.\n\nThe Surveillance Camera Players have been the inspiration for others who have gone on to create artistic project that involve some form of surveillance, however, they say that although they are flattered that they inspire others, they’re rarely impressed by the work that is created. Their complaint is that in the videos that are created, the artists usually end up promoting \"several of the primary ideological supports for generalized surveillance.\" These works of art fail to connect their audiences to the everyday people who are being watched.\n\nLegally, police officials consider Surveillance Art as an extraordinary method of keeping people safe. According to police officials in State College, Pennsylvania, surveillance is divided into three major concepts \"national, mechanical, and perceived; all of which have transformed from legally used terms into art.\"\n\nNational Surveillance is government-based surveillance that aids police officers as well as the community. As far as aiding the community with national surveillance, \"all police vehicles are equipped with a hidden GPS locater that has the ability to transmit the position of a police vehicle anywhere in the country.\" For the community, National Surveillance means that a police official’s vehicle is heavily monitored at all times, causing him to be reprimanded if not at the location reported. From a governmental perspective, National Surveillance is essential for aiding police officials in investigations or simply identifying criminals. The Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS) allows police officials to \"fingerprint and receive information on anyone who has ever been fingerprinted in only fifteen to twenty minutes.\" With the information gathered from an interview with a State College, Pennsylvania police officer, it is clear that National Surveillance has generated a type of \"system balance\" (between the government and the community) whose purpose with advancements in surveillance technology is to portray \"truth.\"\n\nMechanical surveillance, although sharing similarities with National Surveillance, plays a somewhat different role in surveillance as an art form. During the interview with the State College police officer, it was noted that \"the camera in a police vehicle begins recording as soon as its emergency lights are switched on whether the vehicle is stopped or in motion.\" This form of mechanical surveillance plays a huge role in police investigation along with helping create surveillance art. With Internet sites like YouTube, Facebook, and MySpace, people have the ability to create and share any type of video feed that interests them. As an example, the anonymous State College police officer referred to the riots at Penn State University after Penn State beat Ohio State University during the 2008-2009-football season. Several videos were posted on YouTube depicting celebratory acts that quickly transitioned into destructive malicious behavior. First, State College Police referred to these posted videos as police evidence in which they were able to apprehend and fine individuals involved in the riots. On the other hand, however, there are several videos of the riots in which inspirational music was added to portray \"Penn State Pride\" rather than committing an illegal act. Adding music to these types of videos transforms mechanical surveillance into Surveillance Art by creating an emotional attachment for the individuals who can relate to what the video visually portrays.\n\nPerceived surveillance is a concept of Surveillance Art that is purely territorial and usually created by individuals involved with that particular community. Using State College, Pennsylvania as an example, an anonymous police officer stated that he believes Surveillance Art \"creates a presence in the community that lowers the likelihood of crime, portraying a sense of ownership.\" With the advancement of technology in today’s society, it has become apparent that it is relatively easier for individuals to create \"Perceived Surveillance Art.\" The interesting aspect of Perceived Surveillance Art is the fact that it can be anything. Examples of Perceived Surveillance Art can range from a mural on the side of a building to a simple statue of the baby Jesus in the front yard of an individual's home.\n\n\"With these created websites, YouTube, Facebook, and MySpace, it has become relatively easy for individuals to post and spread Surveillance Art throughout the world.\" In some instances, there are highly controversial videos (Rodney King beating and the shooting death of Oscar Grant by police officers) placed on these sites that have been edited to portray a specific individuals perception of that specific event or a different perspective on how that event should possibly be taken. When asking the State College police officer about how these sites affect police investigations, he stated that they \"have no bearing on anything having to do with police work.\" In fact, the new interpretations presented by the videos on these sites are welcomed by some police officers that like the idea and believe in Surveillance Art.\n\nWhile discussing surveillance as an art form with a New York City bus driver, it was found to be \"impossible for an individual to travel more than three blocks anywhere in New York without being on camera.\" When considering the three forms of surveillance (national, mechanical, and perceived) as art forms, it is clear that our society has evolved into a technically dependent era in which even the most reliable footage (unedited surveillance footage) can become art by simply transforming or even editing raw footage (adding music, or text) creating new material, resulting in Surveillance Art. Although the amount of surveillance in State College, Pennsylvania may not be as high as the amount of surveillance in New York City, it is interesting and notable that surveillance as an art form exists everywhere.\n\nThese examples are representative of Surveillance Art's methods and effects. Although they use different technologies and tactics, they are united by an interest in the increasing prevalence of surveillance in modern society, and its effects on citizens and communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3618333", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3618333", "title": "The Perfect Storm (film)", "text": "The Perfect Storm (film)\n\nThe Perfect Storm is a 2000 American biographical disaster drama film directed by Wolfgang Petersen and based on the 1997 non-fiction book of the same name by Sebastian Junger. The film tells the story of the \"Andrea Gail\", a commercial fishing vessel that was lost at sea with all hands after being caught in the Perfect Storm of 1991. The film stars George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, William Fichtner, Michael Ironside, John C. Reilly, Diane Lane, Karen Allen and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. It was released on June 30, 2000, by Warner Bros.\n\nIn October 1991, the commercial fishing boat \"Andrea Gail\" returns to port in Gloucester, Massachusetts, with a poor catch. Desperate for money, Captain Billy Tyne (Clooney) convinces the \"Andrea Gail\" crew to join him for one more late season fishing expedition. The crew heads out past their usual fishing grounds on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, leaving a developing tropical storm behind them. Initially unsuccessful, they head to the Flemish Cap, where their luck greatly improves. At the height of their fishing, the ice machine breaks; the only way to sell their catch before it spoils is to hurry back to shore. After debating whether to sail through the building storm or to wait it out, the crew decides to risk the storm. However, between \"Andrea Gail\" and Gloucester is a confluence of two powerful weather fronts and a hurricane, which the \"Andrea Gail\" crew underestimates.\n\nAfter repeated warnings from other ships, \"Andrea Gail\" loses her antenna, forcing Captain Linda Greenlaw (Mastrantonio) of sister ship \"Hannah Boden\" to call in a Mayday. A New York Air National Guard HH-60 Pave Hawk rescue helicopter responds, but after failing to perform a midair refueling with an HC-130 Hercules, the helicopter crew ditch their aircraft. All but one of the Air National Guard crew members are rescued by a Coast Guard vessel, the USCGC \"Tamaroa\".\n\nAfter \"Andrea Gail\" endures various problems, the crew struggles to sail through pounding waves and shrieking winds, while friends and family worry and wait for a ship that never comes home. The vessel encounters an enormous rogue wave. They attempt to drive the boat over the wave but it crests before it can get to the top and is overturned; Billy elects to go down with his ship, the rest of the crew are trapped inside and only one, rookie fisherman Bobby Shatford (Wahlberg), manages to get out. He surfaces and watches as \"Andrea Gail\" rights herself before sinking stern-first into the Atlantic. As Bobby silently says his goodbyes to his loved ones, the rapidly rising swell carries him away.\n\nThere are no survivors; Linda reads the eulogy at the memorial, followed by her remembering Billy's voice soliloquising about what it means to be a swordboat captain.\n\n\nA ship similar to \"Andrea Gail\", \"Lady Grace\", was used during the filming of the movie. Most of the names used were not changed for the fictional film, but in response two lawsuits were later filed by certain families of the crew members. The film only claims to be \"based on a true story\", and differs in many ways from the book starting with the fictionalization of the material into a \"story\". The events shown in the film after the Andrea Gail's last radio contact are pure speculation, as the boat and the bodies of the crew were never found.\n\nContrary to the movie's storyline, Captain Linda Greenlaw says she did not place a distress call on behalf of \"Andrea Gail\". \"Without a distress call (directly) from the imperiled vessel, the Coast Guard will not initiate a search until the vessel is five days overdue in port,\" Greenlaw said. The 1993 U.S. Coast Guard's investigative report said that \"Andrea Gail\" was experiencing 30-foot waves and winds from anywhere from 50 to 80 knots around the time of the last communication. The conditions, though threatening, were probably not unfamiliar to Tyne, who had been a successful fisherman for about a decade on other vessels, taking trips to the Grand Banks and fishing off Florida, the Carolinas, and elsewhere. In addition, Hurricane Grace (1991) was described by a weather forecaster as a category 5 storm in the movie, though it never achieved those wind speeds. In the movie, Tyne and his crew agreed to head into the dangerous storm in order to save their fish from spoiling. Greenlaw acknowledged that Tyne did mention having ice problems, but that was not unusual. \"My one gripe about [the] movie was how Warner Brothers depicted Billy Tyne and his crew as making a very conscious decision to steam into a storm that they knew was dangerous,\" said Greenlaw. \"That is not what happened. \"Andrea Gail\" was three days into their steam home when the storm hit. Whatever happened to \"Andrea Gail\" happened very quickly.\"\n\nAn Air National Guard helicopter was dispatched from Francis S. Gabreski Air National Guard Base on Long Island, New York, but not in response to the Andrea Gail or Satori (\"Mistral\" in the movie). The helicopter departed mid-storm on a mission to help save a lone Japanese fisherman from a sinking sailboat 250 miles off the New Jersey coast. Unsuccessful and running low on fuel, the Air National Guard HH-60G helicopter was compelled to attempt a mid-flight refueling maneuver. The zero-visibility conditions thwarted their efforts, however, and lacking enough fuel to make the flight back to the Long Island base, the crew were forced to ditch the helicopter. After a search by \"Tamaroa\", four of the HH-60's crew were picked up; one was never seen again. The Japanese yachtsman was later rescued by a Romanian cargo ship.\n\nWhen asked about the portrayal of \"Sully\" in the movie, Cathy Sullivan Mustone, an older sister of David \"Sully\" Sullivan, said she was disappointed. \"They made my brother's character out to be a hothead,\" she said. \"I guess every movie needs a villain, but my brother was a funny guy with a loud laugh and a big smile. He had a lot of guts and he loved fishing.\" In fact, David's bravery and quick thinking made headlines on a different boat—\"Harmony\". One night during a winter fishing trip, \"Harmony\" began taking on water while tied to another boat. The crew of \"Harmony\" yelled for help, hoping to wake the nearby crew. No one woke, so David dove into the icy water, pulling himself on the ropes that tied the boats together. As a result of his bravery, \"Harmony\"'s crew was saved. Mustone said, \"At least in the movie, they did represent my brother's bravery in a water rescue scene. He was a good man. And I just know he is at peace in heaven, safe with our Dad.\"\n\nThe crew members of \"Satori\" (renamed \"Mistral\" in the movie) were not rescued by an Air National Guard helicopter, but rather a U.S. Coast Guard helicopter. The helicopter was changed in the film after the Air National Guard had issues consulting with the movie producers. According to the owner's son, \"Satori\" never made a 360° roll, although it had two knockdowns, during which it lay on its side for about 30 seconds. In response to requests by the crew, Captain Ray Leonard permitted the two crewmembers to make a position report over radio, during which they made an unauthorized Mayday call. One of those crewmembers reported that she was so convinced that she was going to die that she wrote her name down and put it into a plastic bag so that her body could be identified when it was finally found.\n\nThere is controversy over whether the Captain was drunk, as charged by the women in the book, with Leonard objecting to this characterization. Out of compassion for the expected loss of his boat, the Coast Guard did not test his blood alcohol levels at the time. The Coast Guard declared the voyage manifestly unsafe and ordered everyone off-board, including the unwilling skipper. The Coast Guard first tried to take them on board via an inflatable boat, but after it was damaged when trying to approach \"Satori\" they sent a helicopter, which is a much riskier approach, as a rescue swimmer must jump into dangerous seas. The Coast Guard helicopter did not try to lower rescue gear onto the yacht (as shown in the movie, where it gets entangled with the mast), but rather asked the crew of \"Satori\" to jump overboard to meet a rescue swimmer in the water. Leonard eventually complied with the request.\n\nAfter the storm, Leonard searched for the \"Satori\", hoping to find her still afloat, but in spite of his attempts she was found a few days later washed ashore on a Maryland beach, a bag of personal belongings still on deck. Leonard paid for a 60-foot fishing vessel to drag her off the beach, helped by a channel dug by Park Rangers who had been guarding the boat. He continued to sail the boat until 2000, and she remained in use with a new owner .\n\n\"The Perfect Storm\" received mixed reviews from critics, with a 47% approval rating on critic site Rotten Tomatoes with a consensus of, \"While the special effects are well done and quite impressive, this film suffers a lack of any actual drama or characterization. The end result is a film that offers nifty eye-candy and nothing else.\"\n\n\"The Perfect Storm\" was a box office success. On its opening weekend, it debuted with $42 million ahead of Sony's \"The Patriot\" and eventually brought in over $182.6 million in the United States, and $146.1 million around the world to a total of $328.7 million worldwide.\n\nThe film was nominated for 2 Academy Awards, Best Visual Effects (Walt Conti, Stefen Fangmeier, John Frazier and Habib Zargarpour) and Best Sound (John T. Reitz, Gregg Rudloff, David E. Campbell and Keith A. Wester), but lost both to \"Gladiator\".\n\nAfter the film was released, the families of two crew members sued the film makers for the fictionalization of events which happened prior to the loss of \"Andrea Gail\". In 2005, the Florida Supreme Court ruled against the family of Captain Tyne by a 6–2 vote. Some unnamed families also sued the producers in federal district court, claiming that their names were used without their permission, and that facts were changed. The district court, which is also located in Florida, dismissed the case, as in their opinion the defendants' First Amendment right to freedom of speech barred the suit. The plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, which could not decide how to interpret the Florida law at issue and certified the question to the Florida Supreme Court. In the end, the Florida Supreme Court upheld the district court's interpretation of Florida law, and remanded the case to the 11th Circuit, which affirmed the prior decision to dismiss the case.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37917324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37917324", "title": "The Tallow Candle", "text": "The Tallow Candle\n\n\"The Tallow Candle\" () is a 700-word literary fairytale by Danish writer Hans Christian Andersen (1805–1875).\n\nIt was written in the 1820s, making it one of his earliest works and his first known work in the fairytale genre, but its existence was apparently unknown to scholars or the public for almost two centuries. A copy of the manuscript was discovered in a filing box in the National Archives of Funen in October 2012.\n\nA tallow candle, whose parents are a sheep and a melting pot, becomes more and more disheartened as it cannot find a purpose in life. It meets a tinderbox who lights a flame on the candle, and it finally finds its right place in life and spreads joy and happiness for itself and its fellow creatures.\n\nThe manuscript was discovered in late 2012 in a suitcase with documents belonging to the Plum family in the local branch of the Danish National Archives in Funen, Denmark. The first people to come across the document were a couple doing amateur research into their family history, but they thought nothing of it since it seemed unrelated to genealogy. Later the archivist and local historian Esben Brage noted the document's signature and realized that it might be an original H. C. Andersen document. Danish experts confirmed its authorship in December 2012.\n\nAndersen scholars agree that the work is not of the same literary quality as his later tales, and that it has many similarities with other writings from his time at the Latinate schools in Slagelse and Elsinore. It was dedicated to Madame Bunkeflod, a vicar's widow and one of the young Andersen's benefactors. One scholar argued that the tale was overly didactic and moralistic, and lacking Andersen's later sense of humor, probably to impress his benefactress, who had paid for his education. Danish author and Andersen specialist Johannes Møllehave opined that the tale could have been written by any bright 15-year-old and that it displayed nothing of Andersen's later virtuosity.\n\nTwo Danish philologists have expressed doubts about the authorship of the fairy tale. They argue that the tale is too close in form to the models used in the Latinate schools of the time for it to be likely to be an original composition, and they have also expressed disbelief in the use of the word \"formfuldendt\" (\"flawless\") which does not otherwise appear in texts until much later. Since the manuscript is difficult to read there is a possibility that what is written is in fact another word.\n\nChristian Graugaard, a Danish poet and professor of sexology, has analyzed the tale as a covert autoerotic tale, in which the candle symbolizes the phallus and the melting tallow the semen in an ejaculation. According to him Andersen often added erotic undertones and metaphoric phallic imagery in his tales. He characterizes the fairy tale as \"a literary cumshot\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42206", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42206", "title": "Western Christianity", "text": "Western Christianity\n\nWestern Christianity is the Latin Church, and Protestantism, together with the offshoots of these such as independent Catholicism and Restorationist churches taken together. The large majority of the world's 2.4 billion Christians are Western Christians (about 2 billion – 1.2 billion Latin Catholic / 800 million Protestant). The original and still major part, the Latin Church, developed under the bishop of Rome (the Patriarch of the West) in the former Western Roman Empire in Antiquity. Out of the Latin Church emerged a wide variety of independent Protestant denominations, including Lutheranism and Anglicanism, starting from the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, as did Independent Catholicism in the 19th century. Thus, the term \"Western Christianity\" does not describe a single communion or religious denomination, but is applied to distinguish all these denominations collectively from Eastern Christianity.\n\nThe establishment of the distinct Latin Church, a particular church sui iuris of the Catholic Church (in contrast to the Eastern Catholic Churches, also in full communion with the Pope in Rome) coincided with the consolidation of the Holy See in Rome, where the bishop claimed a particular role since Antiquity. The terms \"Western\" and \"Eastern\" in this regard originated with geographical divisions mirroring the cultural divide between the Hellenistic east and Latin West, and the political divide between the Western and Eastern Roman empires. During the Middle Ages adherents of the Latin Church, irrespective of ethnicity, commonly referred to themselves as \"Latins\" to distinguish themselves from Eastern Christians.\n\nWith the expansion of European colonialism from the Early Modern era, the Latin Church, in time along with its Protestant secessions, spread throughout the Americas, much of the Philippines, Southern Africa, pockets of West Africa, and throughout Australia, and New Zealand. Thus, when used for historical periods after the 16th century, the term \"Western Christianity\" does not refer to a particular geographical area, but is rather used as a collective term for the Latin Church, the Protestant denominations, and Independent Catholicism that trace their lineage to the original Latin Church in Western Europe.\n\nToday, the geographical distinction between Western and Eastern Christianity is not nearly as absolute as in Antiquity or the Middle Ages, due to the spread of Christian missionaries, migrations, and globalisation. The adjectives \"Western Christianity\" and \"Eastern Christianity\" are typically used to refer to historical origins and differences in theology and liturgy, rather than present geographical locations.\n\nWhile the Latin Church maintain the Latin liturgical rites, Protestant denominations and Independent Catholicism retain a wide variety of liturgical practices.\n\nFor most of its history the church in Europe has been culturally divided between the Latin-speaking west, whose centre was Rome, and the Greek-speaking east, whose centre was Constantinople. Cultural differences and political rivalry created tensions between the two churches, leading to disagreement over doctrine and ecclesiology and ultimately to schism.\n\nLike Eastern Christianity, Western Christianity traces its roots directly to the apostles and other early preachers of the religion. In Western Christianity's original area Latin was the principal language. Christian writers in Latin had more influence there than those who wrote in Greek, Syriac, or other Eastern languages. Though the first Christians in the West used Greek (such as Clement of Rome), by the fourth century Latin had superseded it even in the cosmopolitan city of Rome, while there is evidence of a Latin translation of the Bible in the 2nd century (see also Vetus Latina) in southern Gaul and the Roman province of Africa.\n\nWith the decline of the Roman Empire, distinctions appeared also in organization, since the bishops in the West were not dependent on the Emperor in Constantinople and did not come under the influence of the Caesaropapism in the Eastern Church. While the see of Constantinople became dominant throughout the Emperor's lands, the West looked exclusively to the see of Rome, which in the East was seen as that of one of the five patriarchs of the Pentarchy, \"the proposed government of universal Christendom by five patriarchal sees under the auspices of a single universal empire. Formulated in the legislation of the emperor Justinian I (527–565), especially in his Novella 131, the theory received formal ecclesiastical sanction at the Council in Trullo (692), which ranked the five sees as Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem.\"\n\nOver the centuries, disagreements separated Western Christianity from the various forms of Eastern Christianity: first from East Syriac Christianity after the Council of Ephesus (431), then from that of Oriental Orthodoxy after the Council of Chalcedon (451), and then from Eastern Orthodoxy with the East-West Schism of 1054. With the last-named form of Eastern Christianity, reunion agreements were signed at the Second Council of Lyon (1274) and the Council of Florence (1439), but these proved ineffective.\n\nThe rise of Protestantism led to major divisions within Western Christianity, which still persist, and wars—for example, the Anglo-Spanish War of 1585–1604 had religious as well as economic causes.\n\nIn and after the Age of Discovery, Europeans spread Western Christianity to the New World and elsewhere. Roman Catholicism came to the Americas (especially South America), Africa, Asia, Australia and the Pacific. Protestantism, including Anglicanism, came to North America, Australia-Pacific and some African locales.\n\nToday, the geographical distinction between Western and Eastern Christianity is now much less absolute, due to the great migrations of Europeans across the globe, as well as the work of missionaries worldwide over the past five centuries.\n\nAlthough \"original sin\" can be taken to mean the sin that Adam committed, it is usually understood as a consequence of the first sin, the hereditary stain with which we are born on account of our origin or descent from Adam.\nWith the exception of tendencies such as Pelagianism, Western Christianity is thought to hold this doctrine, which was championed especially by Saint Augustine, who wrote: \"The deliberate sin of the first man is the cause of original sin\" (De nupt. et concup., II, xxvi, 43).\n\nMost Western Christians use a version of the Nicene Creed that states that the Holy Spirit \"proceeds from the Father and the Son\", where the original text as adopted by the First Council of Constantinople had \"proceeds from the Father\" without the addition of either \"and the Son\" or \"alone\". This Western version also has the additional phrase \"God from God\" (in Latin \"Deum de Deo\"), which was in the Creed as adopted by the First Council of Nicaea, but which was dropped by the First Council of Constantinople.\n\nThe date of Easter usually differs between Eastern and Western Christianity, because the calculations are based on the Julian calendar and Gregorian calendar respectively. However, before the Council of Nicea various dates including Jewish Passover were observed. Nicea \"Romanized\" the date for Easter and anathematized a \"Judaized\" (i.e. Passover date for) Easter. The date of observance of Easter has only differed in modern times since the promulgation of the Gregorian calendar in 1582; and further, the Western Church did not universally adopt the Gregorian calendar at once, so that for some time the dates of Easter differed as between the Eastern Church and the Roman Catholic Church, but not necessarily as between the Eastern Church and the Western Protestant churches. For example, the Church of England continued to observe Easter on the same date as the Eastern Church until 1753.\n\nEven the dates of other Christian holidays differ between Eastern and Western Christianity.\n\nToday, Western Christianity makes up close to 90% of Christians worldwide with the Catholic Church accounting for over half and various Protestant denominations making up another 40%. \n\nHussite movements of 15th century Bohemia preceded the main Protestant uprising by 100 years and evolved into several small Protestant churches, such as the Moravian Church. Waldensians survived also, but blended into the Reformed tradition.\n\n"}

It sparked interest because one group of researchers reported that it exhibits zero thermal expansion, while being conductive. Such materials have applications in space and other environments where low thermal expansion materials are required. Subsequent measurements by other groups were however not able to reproduce their results, but rather found expansion coefficients similar to copper.\n\nNevertheless, YbGaGe does show anomalous thermal expansion. Near zero thermal expansion was observed by Booth et al. It was found that near-zero thermal expansion (NZTE) in YbGaGe is sensitive to stoichiometry and defect concentration, however, the NZTE mechanism remains elusive \n"}

The first Ökofeszt was organized by Védegylet and Zöld Fiatalok and held on 15 and 16 April 2005 in Budapest.\n\nThe slogan of the festival was \"Politics Can Be Different\" which led to the formation of an eponymous political party in 2009. Politics Can Be Different won seats in the National Assembly in the 2010 parliamentary election. The key issues of the festival were environmental protection, sustainable development and the fight against corruption in the current Hungarian political elite. The public face of the party is András Schiffer, who presented a talk at the first Ökofeszt in 2005 and is a former member of the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union.\n\n"}
