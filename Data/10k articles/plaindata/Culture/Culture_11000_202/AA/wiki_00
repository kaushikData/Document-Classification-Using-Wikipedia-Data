Other Roman emperors, including Geta and Severus Alexander, were followers of the medical teachings of Serenus Sammonicus and may have used the incantation as well.\n\nIt was used as a magical formula by the Gnostics of the sect of Basilides in invoking the aid of beneficent spirits against disease and misfortune.

In essence, Africana studies and black studies are interchangeable terms stressing black studies in a global and comparative sense, whereas African-American studies frequently emphasizes the U.S. African-American experience. Programs of study range from interdepartmental programs to autonomous departments, and are offered from the undergraduate through the doctoral levels. In many institutions, Africana studies research and study takes place in departments combining African and African-American studies.\n\nAfricana studies departments at many major universities grew out of the black studies programs and departments formed in the late 1960s in the context of the US Civil Rights Movement, as black studies programs were reformed and renamed \"Africana studies,\" with an aim to encompass the continent of Africa and all of the African diaspora using terminology rooted in geography and history rather than race. The first \"Africana\" studies department was formed after the Willard Straight Hall takeover at Cornell University, an Ivy League School located in Ithaca, New York.\n\nThe African-American historian and emeritus professor from this department, Robert L. Harris, offers a useful definition of the field in Jacqueline Bobo, Cynthia Hudley and Claudine Michel's anthology \"The Black Studies Reader\": \"Africana Studies is the multidisciplinary analysis of the lives and thought of people of African ancestry on the African continent and throughout the world. It embraces Africa, Afro-America, and the Caribbean, but does not confine itself to those three geographical areas. Africana studies examines people of African ancestry wherever they may be found—for example, in Central and South America, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Its primary means of organization are racial and cultural. Many of the themes of Africana studies are derived from the historical position of African peoples in relation to Western societies and in the dynamics of slavery, oppression, colonization, imperialism, emancipation, self-determination, liberation, and socioeconomic and political development.\" \nThus, it can be described as a \"scholarship of compromise and acquiescence\", contrasting with the historical black studies which were motivated by the struggle for civil rights.\n\nA specific aim and objective of this interdisciplinary field of study is to help students broaden their knowledge of the worldwide human experience by presenting an aspect of that experience—the Black Experience—which has traditionally been neglected or distorted by educational institutions. Additionally, this course of study strives to introduce an Afro-centric perspective including phenomena related to the culture.\nAccording to Robert Harris Jr, an emeritus professor of history at the Africana Studies Research Center at Cornell, there have been four stages in the development of Africana studies: from the 1890s until the Second World War numerous organizations developed to analyze the culture and history of African peoples (African studies). In the second stage the focus turned to African Americans (Afro-American studies). In the third stage a bevy of newly conceived academic programs were established as Black studies.\n\nUnlike the other stages, Black studies grew out of mass rebellions of black college students and faculty in search of a scholarship of change. The fourth stage, the new name \"Africana studies\" involved a theoretical elaboration of the discipline of black studies according to African cultural reclamation and disparate tenets in the historical and cultural issues of Africanity within a professorial interpretation of the interactions between these fields and college administrations.\n\nThus Africana studies reflected the mellowing and institutionalization of the black studies movement in the course of its integration into the mainstream academic curriculum. Black studies and Africana studies differ primarily in that Africana studies focuses on Africanity and the historical and cultural issues of Africa and its descendants while Black studies was designed to deal with the uplift and development of the black (African-American)community in relationship to education and its \"relevance\" to the black community. The adaptation of the term \"Africana studies\" appears to have derived from the encyclopedia work of W.E.B. Du Bois and Carter G. Woodson. James Turner, who was recruited from graduate school at Northwestern on the heels of the student rebellions of 1969, first used the term to describe a global approach to Black studies and name the \"Africana Studies and Research Center\" at Cornell, where he acted as the founding director.\n\n\"Studia Africana\", subtitled \"An International Journal of Africana Studies\" was published by the Department for African American Studies at the University of Cincinnati in a single issue in 1977 (an unrelated journal called \"Studia Africana\" is published by the Centro de Estudios Africanos, Barcelona, since 1990).\nThe \"International Journal of Africana Studies\" (ISSN 1056-8689) has been appearing since 1992, published by the National Council for Black Studies.\n\n\n\n\n"}

An aristeia can result in the death of the hero at the aristeia's end.\n\nOne of the most prototypical examples of \"aristeia\" is in \"Book 21\" of the Iliad when Achilles almost single-handedly routs the Trojan army. This includes his chase of Hector around Troy; Achilles eventually succeeds in killing him and dragging his corpse around the city. Other instances of this phenomenon in the \"Iliad\" are found in Diomedes' performance in battle while empowered by Athena (\"Book V\"), Hector's leading of the Trojan assault on the Achaian camp in \"Book VIII\" (with the help of Zeus), Agamemnon's aristeia in Book XI where he's on such a rampage that Zeus himself has to warn Hector against meeting him in battle, as well as Patroclus' aristeia in \"Book XVI\", which ultimately leads to his demise at the hands of Hector. In \"Book XXII\" of the Odyssey, Greek hero Odysseus slaughters all of the suitors in his palace in another homeric display of martial excellence.\nIt is also seen, to some extent, in the Aeneid, when Nisus and Euryalus leave the Trojan defenses to slaughter the Latin captains while they sleep.

Since the beginning of time (the Dreaming) storytelling played a vital role in Australian Aboriginal culture, one of the world's oldest cultures. Aboriginal children were told stories from a very early age; stories that helped them understand the air, the land, the universe, their people, their culture and their history. Elders told stories of their journeys and their accomplishments. As the children grew into adults they took on the responsibility of passing on the stories. These stories are as much a cultural necessity as they are entertainment and are still passed on orally though many are now recorded in print, audio and video\n\nThe Songlines, also called Dreaming tracks, were a form of Indigenous storytelling that brought about understanding of the landscape. They told stories about the path of a creator-spirit during the Dreaming. There is a large collection of stories from the Aboriginal Dreamtime that form a large part of Australian storytelling history. These include stories about the Bunyip.\n\nThese Europeans who came to the continent in the form of convicts, soldiers and settlers brought their own stories which were passed around Britain's new penal colony orally. For the 150 000 convicts who were transported to Australia in the late 18th and early 19th centuries stories were essential. They had been harshly, and often unjustly, treated and exiled with no hope of returning to the land of their birth. It is through stories that we create culture. The convicts, most of whom were from the labouring classes of England, Wales and Ireland, needed to recreate their culture in an alien environment. While the stories they brought with them offered comfort during the desperate loneliness of isolation they also needed to forget the country that had forsaken them. So by the 1820s the songs and stories the convicts brought from the British Isles had begun to merge with the stories of their new land as they went about recreating their lives and their culture. \nAn anti-authoritarian attitude emerged in their new culture which was often reflected in their stories. Some of the pain of abandonment was eased through the sharing of stories about bushrangers who dared to rob the rich and flout authority. One such bushranger was Ned Kelly who became a hero of the people and a legend in life and death. His is still one of the best known Australian stories.\n\nLater, the prospectors who flooded Australian goldfields during the 1800s brought with them the stories they heard on the American goldfields. These stories soon took on an Australian flavour and became part of the country's folklore. Other stories, uniquely Australian, also sprang from the goldfields. One such story is the story of the Eureka Stockade—a miners' uprising on the Ballarat goldfields in 1854—said to be the start of democracy in Australia. New developments brought new stories; stories of pioneers who survived harsh conditions, stories of explorers such as Burke and Wills and stories of tragic shipwrecks. Events reported in newspapers were shared orally, and no doubt embellished.\n\nThe Depression years of the 1930s brought the itinerant storyteller;the swagmen who carried the stories across the vast continent as they walked from town to town looking for work. Many of the swaggies became practised oral storytellers as, night after night, they camped on riverbanks and yarned by the fire. Well-known Australian storyteller Nell Bell remembers \"my grandfather telling me about his mates, fencing contractors in northwest NSW, and my grandmother as she churned, telling me tales of leprechauns and willy willies. There were the Chinese market gardens at the top of the street with tales of emperors and peacocks; the tramp who lived under the bridge and told me tale after tale and the metho [methylated spirits] drinker with tales of America and the Outback. These were real folks, a purely Australian tradition.\" \n\nOne of the itinerant storytellers from the depression years was Henry Lawson, who was born on the goldfields—the son of a Norwegian seaman. He roamed the bush with the swagmen. Fame, though not fortune, came to him through his poems and short stories and when he died in 1922 he was honoured with a state funeral.\n\nMany Australian stories, such as Lawson's \"The Drover's Wife\", developed in the distant and harsh conditions of the Australian bush where men and women would \"wonder and fear\". Sharing stories helped ease loneliness and homesickness, brought back memories of comfortable times and places and generated a feeling of togetherness against the wild unknown. The stories were told around the fire while the billy boiled; the fire and the stories combining to offer a feeling of security.\n\nThe war years (1914–18 and 1939–45) added another dimension to Australian folktales. New heroes began to emerge. From the First World War emerged the Anzacs and the story of Simpson and his donkey, and Sister Vivian Bullwinkel to name just a few. \n\nAfter World War II the Jewish refugees from Eastern Europe and many other different ethnic groups have each added rich dimensions to Australian storytelling. Post-war affluence brought new mediums of entertainment and new ways of telling stories and the oral tradition was overlooked for many years.\n\nHowever, in the 1970s oral storytelling was given new life with the formation of storytelling guilds in Victoria and Western Australia and later in New South Wales and other states. In Australia today there are active guilds in Queensland, Western Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia. These guilds have close ties with storytelling guilds in New Zealand. The biennial 'Weaving Stories Together' – Sydney International Storytelling Conference draws participants and presenters from the Americas, Europe, Asia, the Pacific and Australasia.\n\nWith the importance of oral literacy now being acknowledged by many Australian educators, oral storytellers have become a valuable resource for teachers. Many Australian storytellers, such as JB Rowley, Gael Cresp, Jackie Kerin and others, are also successful authors. Another Australian storyteller, Louisa John-Krol, uses stories as a basis for her music.\n\nLarry Brandy is an Aboriginal storyteller who specialises in involving his audience, using artefacts.\n\n1.

{"id": "18345642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18345642", "title": "Behavioral addiction", "text": "Behavioral addiction\n\nBehavioral addiction is a form of addiction that involves a compulsion to engage in a rewarding non-drug-related behavior – sometimes called a natural reward – despite any negative consequences to the person's physical, mental, social or financial well-being. A gene transcription factor known as ΔFosB has been identified as a necessary common factor involved in both behavioral and drug addictions, which are associated with the same set of neural adaptations in the reward system.\n\nDiagnostic models do not currently include the criteria necessary to identify behaviors as addictions in a clinical setting. Behavioral addictions has been proposed as a new class in DSM-5, but the only category included is gambling addiction. Internet gaming addiction is included in the appendix as a condition for further study.\n\nBehavioral addictions, which are sometimes referred to as impulse control disorders, are increasingly recognized as treatable forms of addiction.\nThe type of excessive behaviors identified as being addictive include gambling, food, sexual intercourse, use of pornography, use of computers, playing video games, use of the internet, exercise, and shopping.\n\nResearching addiction to food, for example, a 2009 Scripps Research Institute study found evidence that the same molecular mechanisms correlated with human drug addiction also exist in compulsive overeating in obese rats. The dopamine D receptor studied is associated with vulnerability to drug addiction in humans. It was found downregulated in obese rats exposed to a high fat diet, and further reductions of the receptor increased compulsive eating. The D receptor responds to dopamine, a central neurotransmitter released in anticipation of rewarding, satiating experiences such as those involving food, sex or psychoactive drugs.\n\nIn August 2011, the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) issued a public statement defining all addiction in terms of brain changes. \"Addiction is a primary, chronic disease of brain reward, motivation, memory and related circuitry.\"\n\nThe following excerpts are taken from the organization's FAQs: The new ASAM definition makes a departure from equating addiction with just substance dependence, by describing how addiction is also related to behaviors that are rewarding. This is the first time that ASAM has taken an official position that addiction is not solely \"substance dependence.\" This definition says that addiction is about functioning and brain circuitry and how the structure and function of the brains of persons with addiction differ from the structure and function of the brains of persons who do not have addiction. It talks about reward circuitry in the brain and related circuitry, but the emphasis is not on the external rewards that act on the reward system. Food and sexual behaviors and gambling behaviors can be associated with the \"pathological pursuit of rewards\" described in this new definition of addiction. \n\nWe all have the brain reward circuitry that makes food and sex rewarding. In fact, this is a survival mechanism. In a healthy brain, these rewards have feedback mechanisms for satiety or 'enough.' In someone with addiction, the circuitry becomes dysfunctional such that the message to the individual becomes ‘more’, which leads to the pathological pursuit of rewards and/or relief through the use of substances and behaviors. So, anyone who has addiction is vulnerable to food and sex addiction.\n\nSince ASAM released its statement, and shortly before its release, additional new studies have come out on Internet addiction. They reveal the same fundamental brain changes seen in other addicts of drugs. Another 2011 study found that the risk of Internet addiction in men was about three times more than women. Researchers noted, Internet addiction is a psychosocial disorder and its characteristics are as follows: tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, affective disorders, and problems in social relations. Internet usage creates psychological, social, school and/or work difficulties in a person's life. Eighteen percent of study participants were considered to be pathological Internet users, whose excessive use of the Internet was causing academic, social, and interpersonal problems. Excessive Internet use may create a heightened level of psychological arousal, resulting in little sleep, failure to eat for long periods, and limited physical activity, possibly leading to the user experiencing physical and mental health problems such as depression, OCD, low family relationships and anxiety.\n\nBehavioral addiction is a treatable condition. Treatment options include psychotherapy and psychopharmacotherapy (i.e., medications) or a combination of both. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most common form of psychotherapy used in treating behavioral addictions; it focuses on identifying patterns that trigger compulsive behavior and making lifestyle changes to promote healthier behaviors. Currently, there are no medications approved for treatment of behavioral addictions in general, but some medications used for treatment of drug addiction may also be beneficial with specific behavioral addictions. Any unrelated psychiatric disorders should be kept under control, and differentiated from the contributing factors that cause the addiction.\n\nAnother growing area is social media addiction. Psychology researchers surveyed 253 undergraduate students at the University of Albany and found that not only is social media (particularly Facebook) itself potentially addictive, those who use it may also be at greater risk for substance abuse.\n\nΔFosB, a gene transcription factor, has been identified as playing a critical role in the development of addictive states in both behavioral addictions and drug addictions. Overexpression of ΔFosB in the nucleus accumbens is necessary and sufficient for many of the neural adaptations seen in drug addiction; it has been implicated in addictions to alcohol, cannabinoids, cocaine, nicotine, phenylcyclidine, and substituted amphetamines as well as addictions to natural rewards such as sex, exercise, and food. A recent study also demonstrated a cross-sensitization between drug reward (amphetamine) and a natural reward (sex) that was mediated by ΔFosB.\n\nBesides increased ΔFosB expression in the nucleus accumbens, there are many other correlations in the neurobiology of behavioral addictions with drug addictions.\n\nOne of the most important discoveries of addictions has been the drug based reinforcement and, even more important, reward based learning processes. Several structures of the brain are important in the conditioning process of behavioral addiction; these subcortical structures form the brain regions known as the reward system. One of the major areas of study is the amygdala, a brain structure which involves emotional significance and associated learning. Research shows that dopaminergic projections from the ventral tegmental area facilitate a motivational or learned association to a specific behavior. \nDopamine neurons take a role in the learning and sustaining of many acquired behaviors. Research specific to Parkinson's disease has led to identifying the intracellular signaling pathways that underlie the immediate actions of dopamine. The most common mechanism of dopamine is to create addictive properties along with certain behaviors. There are three stages to the dopamine reward system: bursts of dopamine, triggering of behavior, and further impact to the behavior. Once electronically signaled, possibly through the behavior, dopamine neurons let out a ‘burst-fire’ of elements to stimulate areas along fast transmitting pathways. The behavior response then perpetuates the striated neurons to further send stimuli. The fast firing of dopamine neurons can be monitored over time by evaluating the amount of extracellular concentrations of dopamine through micro dialysis and brain imaging. This monitoring can lead to a model in which one can see the multiplicity of triggering over a period of time. Once the behavior is triggered, it is hard to work away from the dopamine reward system.\n\nBehaviors like gambling have been linked to the new found idea of the brain's capacity to anticipate rewards. The reward system can be triggered by early detectors of the behavior, and trigger dopamine neurons to begin stimulating behaviors. But in some cases, it can lead to many issues due to error, or reward-prediction errors. These errors can act as teaching signals to create a complex behavior task over time.\n\n"}

Care must be taken to distinguish true compartments from items upon which supporters are merely resting one or more feet, or, sometimes, mere heraldic badges or pure decoration under the shield, and, conversely, care must also be taken in very unusual cases such as the coat of arms of Belize, in which what may be taken to be a crest, the mahogany tree rising above the shield, is really part of the compartment. It is sometimes said to represent the land held by the bearer. As an official part of the blazon it is a comparatively late feature of heraldry, often derived from the need to have different supporters for different families or entities, although sometimes the compartment is treated in the blazon separately from the supporters.\n\nIf the compartment is mentioned in the blazon it forms part of the grant and is an integral part of the arms e.g. the current royal arms of the United Kingdom are required to have a compartment with plant badges. If no compartment is specified in the blazon then whether to draw one is at the discretion of the artist. The current arms of the Commonwealth of Australia are usually depicted on a compartment of a wreath of wattle, the national flower. It would be acceptable to omit the wattle or substitute something else as it does not form part of the grant.\n\nThe decorative flourish which was often placed by heraldic artists under the feet, hooves or paws of supporters, chiefly in the 19th century, was disparagingly known by some as the \"gas bracket,\" although this term never had any official currency; the only case in which something similar was ever actually mentioned in the blazon was the \"arabesque\" vert on which the whale supporters of Zaanstad, Noord Holland, the Netherlands, balance. The compartment of the coat of arms of Michigan is similar.\n\nA unique instance in which the supporters stand on the motto scroll is in the arms of New Jersey. The coat of arms of the Netherlands, likewise, features the two lion supporters standing on the motto scroll.\n\nUsually when arms are augmented by supporters, a compartment will be added too. In rare cases, a compartment might be granted as an augmentation. A compartment without supporters is possible but practically unknown, with the exception of the Coat of Arms of South Australia.\n\nA compartment is usually some kind of landscape (in the case of Scottish chiefs it is generally a \"mount vert\" - \"grassy mount\" covered with the clan's flower) or seascape, and these can be quite elaborate. These elaborate designs particularly feature in more recent Canadian grants, such as the compartment of the University of Northern British Columbia, in which the female Kermode bear and woodland caribou buck stand on a forest, mountain peaks and ears of wheat, all rising out of the conventionalised heraldic representation of water, which is itself charged with an orca.\n\nCompartments can have a specific piece of geography; Kenya's compartment is Mount Kenya and the compartment of Arbeláez, Cundinamarca, Colombia is a globe.\n\nThere are some unusual compartments. The compartment of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada is a quadrangle. The arms of the former Cumberland County Council have a wall as a compartment, while the Canadian Academy of Engineering has a bridge spanning water. The chief of Clan Donnachaidh has a man in chains as a compartment, while that of Dundas of that Ilk is \"a salamander in flames of fire\". \n\nRecent compartments can also feature indigenous non-European features. The arms of Gisborne, New Zealand contain another unique compartment, a Māori waka (canoe).\n\n"}

Members set up an online identity, and after leaving comments on their experiences with other members, develop a reputation. Members can either directly request lodging from other members or post their travel plans publicly and receive offers from other members. However, unless members go through a verification process, which includes a one-time US$60 charge (waived for members who host 4 times per year), they are only able to send messages to 10 other members per week.\n\nCouchsurfing was conceived by computer programmer and New Hampshire native Casey Fenton in 1999, when he was 21 years old. The idea arose after Fenton found a cheap flight from Boston to Iceland but did not have lodging. Fenton hacked into a database of the University of Iceland and randomly e-mailed 1,500 students asking for a homestay. He received between 50 and 100 offers and chose to stay at the home of an Icelandic rhythm and blues singer. On the return flight to Boston, he came up with the idea to create the website. He registered the couchsurfing.com domain name on 12 June 1999.\n\nCouchsurfing International Inc. was formed on 2 April 2003 as a New Hampshire nonprofit organization.\n\nThe website was launched on June 12, 2004 with the cooperation of Dan Hoffer, Sebastien Le Tuan, and Leonardo Silveira.\n\nFrom 2006 until the company raised financing in 2011, development of the website occurred mostly at events called \"Couchsurfing Collectives\", in which members came together to voluntarily improve the website. Collectives took place in Montreal, Vienna, New Zealand, Rotterdam, Costa Rica, Samara, Alaska, Istanbul, and Thailand. However, the collectively-coded website, which was full of software bugs, could not handle the rapid increases in traffic and crashes were common. Many members believed that the website needed to be redesigned from scratch.\n\nIn June 2006, problems with the website database resulted in much of it being irrevocably lost. Founder Casey Fenton posted online asking for help. A Couchsurfing Collective was underway in Montreal at the time and those in attendance raised $8,000 in donations and committed to recreate the website.\n\nThe company applied for status as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization in November 2007 but was rejected by the Internal Revenue Service in early 2011. Hoffer, in charge of strategic development, then believed that non-profit status was an obstacle to innovation due to the audit and regulatory requirements and that a for-profit corporation was the best structure for the company.\n\nThe New Hampshire entity Couchsurfing International Inc. was dissolved on 4 November 2011. Its assets were sold to a for-profit Delaware corporation, also called Couchsurfing International, Inc., which was formed on 3 May 2011.\n\nAt first, the company was a certified B Corporation; however, it is no longer listed as such.\n\nIn August 2011, in conjunction with the reorganization to a for-profit corporation, the company raised $7.6 million in a first-round financing led by Benchmark Capital and Omidyar Network.\n\nIn August 2012, Couchsurfing received an additional $15 million in funding from an investor group led by General Catalyst Partners, with participation by Menlo Ventures, as well as existing investors Benchmark Capital and Omidyar Network. The additional funding brought the company’s total funding raised to $22.6 million.\n\nThe company has a burn rate of $2-3 million per year. However, it has been as high as $800,000 per month.\n\nThe conversion to a for-profit corporation was objected to by many members. Founder Casey Fenton said he received 1,500 emails in the days after announcing the conversion. Even though the founders did not receive any cash from the financing, members were opposed to the founders having a valuable ownership interest in an organization that was financed by donations and built using volunteer work.

{"id": "866517", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=866517", "title": "Dean drive", "text": "Dean drive\n\nThe Dean drive was a device created and promoted by inventor Norman Lorimer Dean (1902–1972) that he claimed to be a reactionless drive. Dean claimed that his device was able to generate a uni-directional force in free space, in violation of Newton's third law of motion from classical physics. His claims generated notoriety because, if true, such a device would have had enormous applications, completely changing human transport, engineering, space travel and more. Dean made several controlled private demonstrations of a number of different devices, however no working models were ever demonstrated publicly or subjected to independent analysis and Dean never presented any rigorous theoretical basis for their operation. Analysts conclude that the motion seen in Dean's device demonstrations was likely reliant on asymmetrical frictional resistance between the device and the surface on which the device was set, resulting in the device moving in one direction when in operation, driven by the vibrations of the apparatus.\n\nThe Dean drive obtained a good deal of publicity in the 1950s and 1960s via the columns and conference presentations of John W. Campbell, the longtime editor of \"Astounding Science Fiction\" magazine. At that time, Campbell believed that his magazine had to change society by helping breakthrough research that was rejected by \"mainstream\" science, and he promoted a series of far-reaching ideas that had dubious scientific bases, like Dianetics, dowsing, the Hieronymus machine, and the Dean Drive. Campbell believed that the device worked and claimed to have witnessed it operating on a bathroom scale. The weight reading on the scale appeared to decrease when the device was activated. He subsequently published photographs of the scale with the drive stopped and running. The June 1960 cover of \"Astounding\" magazine featured a painting of a United States submarine near Mars, supposedly propelled there by a Dean drive.\n\nDean, who was trying to find potential buyers for his technology, was secretive about the details of how it was supposed to work, but it was said to contain asymmetrical rotating weights and to generate a great deal of vibration.\n\nDean and Campbell claimed that Newton’s laws of motion were only an approximation, and that Dean had discovered a fourth law of motion. This has been described as a nonlinear correction to one of Newton’s laws, which, if correct, would allegedly have rendered a reactionless drive feasible after all.\n\nOne result of the initial articles in Campbell's magazine was that two other researchers, William O. Davis and G. Harry Stine, visited Dean and witnessed a demonstration. Results of this visit were published in the May 1962 and June 1976 issues of the magazine, the name of which had been changed by Campbell from \"Astounding\" to \"Analog\". Davis witnessed a demonstration by Dean, and wrote: \"It was the conclusion of both Harry Stine and myself that we had witnessed a real anomaly and that the possibility of fraud in the demonstration was slim.\" Sci-fi writer Jerry Pournelle pointed out that Stine was well qualified to make a judgment on the device, but that he was more gullible than other persons.\n\nDavis's 1962 article was titled, \"The Fourth Law of Motion\", and described a hypothesis in which Dean's device (and others) could conserve momentum invisibly via \"gravitational-inertial radiation\". One detail of Davis's hypothesis involved the forces of action and reaction — physical bodies can respond to those forces nonsimultaneously, or \"out of phase\" with each other.\n\n\"Detesters, Phasers and Dean Drives\", a 1976 article by Davis, reported his tests with Stine, an engineer who built devices to test that aspect of the hypothesis. Stine said they were able to reliably create and reproduce a 3-degree phase angle in a linear system, which was not possible according to ordinary physics. But then they failed to reproduce the effect in a pendulum system, using a rocket-powered ballistic pendulum. The pendulum test would have proved beyond doubt that the Drive worked, but Dean refused to subject the original Dean Drive to a pendulum test. Campbell reported that he had seen the Drive subjected to a pendulum test, but Davis and Stine suspect that he only reported what Dean had told him and had never seen the actual test. Davis says the question can't be settled until the pendulum test is made. Their research was terminated in 1965 when the national economy took a downturn, and was never resumed. The 1976 article was an attempt to get research restarted, but apparently failed.\n\nIn 1984, physicist Amit Goswami wrote that \"Dean's machine made such a splash with readers of science fiction that it is now customary in SF circles to refer to a reactionless drive as a Dean drive.\"\n\nDean made a demonstration for a representative of the magazine \"Popular Mechanics\" of one of his \"Dean drive\" devices. The witness reported that \"While suspended above the ground, was able to pull a load to itself without itself being pulled toward the load\". Another version of the machine was reported to be \"able to apply a force to a hand, without moving—yet when the machine was turned off an equivalent force applied by the hand easily moved the machine\". William O. Davis, who witnessed the latter demonstration, wrote in his notebook about Dean's explanation of how the device worked, \"... does not strike me as valid ... For this reason I have decided to undertake a theoretical study of dynamic systems to see if a concept can be evolved which will describe a world in which Dean's Drive can exist and yet where other known facts are not contradicted.\" Davis produced a hypothesis and it was published in \"Analog\" in 1962.\n\nLater analysis has revealed that the interactions of vibration, friction, and resonance with the springs of the scale are likely the root cause of the apparent weight loss reported by Campbell and others of apparent \"anti-gravity\" and \"reactionless thruster\" effects.\n\nIn the 1950s Jerry Pournelle, working for an aerospace company, contacted Dean to investigate purchasing the device. Dean refused to demonstrate the device without pre-payment and promise of a Nobel prize. Pournelle's company were unwilling to pay for the right to examine the device and never saw the purported model. 3M sent representatives about the same time, and obtained similar results. Pournelle eventually was convinced that Dean's device never worked.\n\nDean was granted two U.S. patents on mechanical devices presumably related to his Dean drive claims. His first patent for a \"System for converting rotary motion into unidirectional motion\" was granted on May 9, 1959. Another patent for a \"Variable oscillator system\" was granted on May 11, 1965. These two patent designs were the only ones where Dean revealed the design details with an explanation for operation. However, the details were incomplete, and it is not possible to build a Dean Drive just from the explanations in the patent. Dean's patents, as well as patents for many other similar devices, have been analyzed and it has been determined that none can produce net directional thrust in free space or violate Newton's Third Law. Dean also demonstrated other mechanical devices that were clearly different from his patent designs but apparently never sought patents for them nor otherwise revealed their design details or theory of operation.\n\nIn 1978 physicist Russell Adams wrote an article in \"Analog\". Searching in the US patent office he had found at least 50 patents of similar reactionless drives. After studying the mechanisms, he concluded that they all relied in friction against the floor they were placed on, and they would be useless in space, where there isn't friction against any surface.\n\nDean's patented devices, and his explanation of how his Drive was supposed to work, were later shown to develop no net weight loss over time and do not violate Newton's third law of motion. Many other inventors claim to have invented similar devices, and they all still remain unproven, and lacking a solid theoretic basis.\n\nAfter Dean's death, neither the demonstration devices nor any working devices were found among his experiments. The demonstration devices were clearly different from the devices patented by Dean, and no diagrams were ever found for them. Consequently, it is impossible to test Dean's reported designs or devices to see if they worked as he claimed.\n\nIn 1997 physicist John G. Cramer mentioned the Dean Drive in \"Analog\" in his column \"Alternate View\". He said that the demonstration made to Campbell was faulty, and the drive had turned out to be bogus, like many other claims of antigravity devices.\n\nIn 2006 a NASA technical memorandum presented the Dean Drive as the most famous example of an \"oscillation thruster\" and examined its theoretical basis and feasibility as a space drive. It said that \"Regrettably, such devices are not breakthroughs, since they still require a connection to the ground to create net motion. The ground is the reaction mass and the frictional connection to the ground is a necessary component to its operation.\" NASA regularly receives proposals of similar devices, and the memo recommended that future reviews of said proposals \"should require that submitters meet minimal thresholds of proof before engaging in further correspondence.\"\n\nIn 2012 a researcher attempting to characterize the Woodward effect, another proposed reactionless drive effect, has stated that she carefully designed her experiments to specifically exclude any \"Dean drive\" effects: the unintended interaction with the environment in, around or touching the apparatus. She considered these effects \"spurious noise\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "29444747", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29444747", "title": "Diagonal method", "text": "Diagonal method\n\nThe diagonal method (DM) is a rule of thumb in photography, painting and drawing. Dutch photographer and lecturer Edwin Westhoff discovered the method when, after having long taught the rule of thirds in photography courses, he conducted visual experiments to investigate why this rule of thirds only loosely prescribes that points of interest should be placed more or less near the intersection of lines, rather than being rigid and demanding placement to be precisely on these intersections. Having studied many photographs, paintings and etchings, he discovered that details of interest were often placed precisely on the diagonals of a square, instead of any \"strong points\" that the rule of thirds or the photographic adaptation of the golden ratio suggests. A photograph is usually a rectangular shape with a ratio of 4:3 or 3:2, in which case one should look at the bisection of each corner. Manually placing certain elements of interest on these lines results in a more pleasing photograph.\n\nDiagonals, the middle perpendiculars, the center and the corners of a square are said to comprise the force lines in a square, and are regarded by some as more powerful than other parts in a square.\n\nAccording to the DM, details that are of interest (to the artist and the viewer) are placed on one or more diagonals of 45 degrees from the four corners of the image. Contrary to other rules of thumb involving composition, such as the rule of thirds and the golden ratio, the DM is not ascribing value to the intersections of its lines. Rather, a detail of interest can be located on any point of the four bisections, to which the viewer’s attention will be drawn. However, the DM is very strict about placing details exactly \"on\" the bisection, allowing for a maximum deviation of one millimeter on an A4-sized picture. Another difference with other rules of thumb is that the DM is not being used for improving a composition.\n\nThe diagonal method was derived from an analysis of how artists intuitively locate details within a composition, and can be used for such analyses. Westhoff discovered that by drawing lines with an angle of 45 degrees from the corners of an image, one can find out which details the artist (deliberately or unconsciously) intended to emphasize. Artists and photographers intuitively place areas of interest within a composition. The DM can assist in determining which details the artist wishes to emphasize. Research by Westhoff has resulted in the finding that important details on paintings and on etchings of Rembrandt, such as eyes, hands or utilities, were placed exactly on the diagonals.\n\nIt is very difficult to consciously place points of attention precisely on the diagonals during the making of photos or artworks, yet it is possible to do this in post-production using guidelines. For instance, the DM can be applied to move the subject of a picture further into a corner.\n\nThe DM can only be applied on images where certain details are supposed to be emphasized or exaggerated, such as a portrait in which a specific body part deserves extra attention by the viewer, or a photograph for advertising a product. Photographs of landscapes and architecture usually rely on the composition as a whole, or have lines other than the bisections to determine the composition, such as the horizon. Only if the picture includes details such as persons, (standalone) trees, or buildings is the DM applicable.\n\n\n"}

It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 12, 2008. In the episode, a new boy at school helps set off an impromptu-singing-and-dancing craze that the boys vow to never go along with, dragging them down into the dregs of unpopularity.\n\nThe episode was written and directed by series co-founder Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States. The episode is a parody of the \"High School Musical\" film series.\n\nStan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny realize that, apart from them, everyone at school has bought into the newest fad, the \"High School Musical\" film series. The four boys repeatedly witness the rest of South Park Elementary collectively break into song, in the spirit of the musical films. Unaware of what \"High School Musical\" is, the boys watch one of the films, but dislike it, and vow never to become a part of this fad. Cartman decides to commit suicide by inducing carbon monoxide poisoning while sleeping under his mother's car (with the engine turned on) but it fails since hybrid cars do not \"do the trick anymore\".\n\nStan fears that Wendy is becoming close with a popular third-grader named Bridon Gueermo (voiced by Parker), because they tend to share lead roles in the musical routines. Stan talks to Bridon in hopes of directing him away from Wendy, and finds out Bridon would prefer to play basketball instead of singing. It is revealed that the reason that Bridon made up the fad because of his theater-crazed, flamboyant metrosexual father (also voiced by Parker) forces him to do it. Stan pressures him to try out with the basketball team anyway. Although Mr. Gueermo is shown to be abusive to his family (though only capable of light, effeminate slaps) Bridon eventually stands up for himself (punching his father in the face), and joins the team.\n\nMeanwhile, unhappy at becoming an outcast in school, Stan decides to join the trend and studies the \"High School Musical\" series intensively, despite having vowed against it. He convinces Kyle, Cartman and Kenny that the world has changed, and they cannot go against the tide anymore. The next day at school, the four boys perform a song along with an equally elaborate dance routine about the importance of following one's dreams. However, upon learning that Bridon has joined the basketball team, everyone else is uninterested and leaves during the boys' performance to watch Bridon play basketball instead. The four kids learn that the rest of the school just liked Bridon for his looks and charisma and not the fad itself.\n\n\"Elementary School Musical\" was one of dozens of \"South Park\" episodes developed the Thursday before broadcast during a writer's meeting. \"\" had opened in theaters several weeks before and was a national hot topic; the team had previously mentioned the series as a target for satire. The initial idea the episode was based on was that everyone in South Park is singing \"High School Musical\"-style numbers, except for the four main boys. Series co-creator Trey Parker joked during the meeting that his objective for the next week would be to write a full-blown musical. The writers returned to the idea not long afterward, and the episode was put into production.\n\nParker and Stone watched the \"High School Musical\" movies during the development of the show. The previous episode of the series, \"About Last Night...\", had required the duo to view the \"Oceans Eleven\" series in preparation, which they later remarked was an easier, more enjoyable task. Upon the realization that the songs in the \"High School Musical\" series appear disconnected from the plot, Parker found it easier to write fodder songs in one week. Stone commented that the episode's story structure is unique in that characters are set up to make a decision, but the audience does not see that decision being made, and the story rather cuts to the aftermath of the decision. This is particularly evident in the episode's final moments, in which the audience never sees the boys preparing their musical number, but are surprised with it at the end. Parker and Stone noted that this structure was further explored in the next episode of the season, The Ungroundable.\n\nStone noted that the children depicted in South Park are fourth graders, the target audience for the Disney films. He spoke in the episode's DVD commentary on how kids at that age tend to watch television in which characters are older and often adolescents. Parker and Stone both admitted their favorite part of the episode were scenes in which Bridon Gueermo's father commands the lead, as they found his character, with his slapping abuse, very amusing.\n\nThe episode is a satire of the \"High School Musical\" series; when the boys watch the film in an attempt to understand the phenomenon, a song from the original film \"Stick to the Status Quo,\" is heard. When asked where the boys have been to have been unaware of the \"High School Musical\" craze, Craig responds \"Peru\"; this is a reference to episodes from earlier in season, \"Pandemic\" and \",\" in which the boys travel to the country of Peru.\n\nDuring Bridon's basketball game, his father is swayed by the \"jock jam\" music played over the loud speakers, which includes the music of Queen and Gary Glitter. When Stan is pressured to sing a song in the episode, he turns to the only songs he knows: the standards \"Someone's In The Kitchen With Dinah\" and \"Happy Birthday\".\n\nTravis Fickett of IGN commented that the episode \"doesn't make as much of the idea as it could\" and rated the episode at 7.5 out of 10. 411mania's DC Perry rated it at 7.4 out of 10 compared it favorably to other episodes of the season, but wrote that \"[b]eing one of the best episodes of this season isn't really an accomplishment ... It just feels like they're running out of ideas.\" Sean O'Neal of \"The A.V. Club\" gave the episode a 'B+' rating, describing it as a \"silly-smart episode that nevertheless ranks as one of the standouts from what's proven to be a very hit-or-miss season\".\n\n\"Elementary School Musical\", along with the thirteen other episodes from \"South Park\"'s twelfth season, were released on a three-disc DVD set and two-disc Blu-ray set in the United States on March 10, 2009. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode, a collection of deleted scenes, and two special mini-features, \"The Making of 'Major Boobage\" and \"Six Days to South Park\".\n\n"}
{"id": "5138153", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5138153", "title": "Enchanted (film)", "text": "Enchanted (film)\n\nEnchanted is a 2007 American musical fantasy romantic comedy film, produced by Walt Disney Pictures and Sonnenfeld and Josephson Entertainment. Written by Bill Kelly and directed by Kevin Lima, the film stars Amy Adams, Patrick Dempsey, James Marsden, Timothy Spall, Idina Menzel, Rachel Covey, and Susan Sarandon. The plot focuses on Giselle, an archetypal Disney Princess, who is forced from her traditional animated world of Andalasia into the live-action world of New York City. \"Enchanted\" was the first Disney film to be distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, instead of Buena Vista Pictures Distribution.\n\nThe film is both an homage to, and a self-parody of, Disney's animated features, making numerous references to Disney's past works through the combination of live-action filmmaking, traditional animation, and computer-generated imagery. It marks the return of traditional animation to a Disney feature film after the company's decision to move entirely to computer animation in 2004. Composer Alan Menken and lyricist Stephen Schwartz, who had written songs for previous Disney films, produced the songs of \"Enchanted\", with Menken also composing its score.\n\nThe animation sequences were produced at James Baxter Animation in Pasadena. Filming of the live action segments took place around New York City. It premiered on October 20, 2007, at the London Film Festival before its wide release on November 21, 2007, in the United States. \"Enchanted\" was well-received critically, established Adams as a leading lady, and earned more than $340 million worldwide at the box office. It won three Saturn Awards, including Best Fantasy Film and Best Actress for Adams. \"Enchanted\" also received two nominations at the 65th Golden Globe Awards and three Best Original Song nominations at the 80th Academy Awards. A sequel, titled \"Disenchanted\", is in development.\n\nIn the animated fairy tale kingdom of Andalasia, the evil Queen Narissa schemes to protect her claim to the throne, which she will lose once her stepson, Prince Edward, finds his true love and marries her. She enlists her loyal henchman Nathaniel to keep Edward distracted. Giselle, a young woman, dreams of meeting a prince and experiencing a \"happy ever after.\" Edward hears Giselle singing and sets off to find her. Nathaniel sets free a captured troll to kill Giselle, but Edward rescues her in time. When they meet, they instantly fall in love and plan to get married the following day.\n\nDisguised as an old hag, Narissa intercepts Giselle on her way to the wedding and pushes her into a well, where she is magically transformed into a 3D live-action version of herself and transported to a manhole in New York City's Times Square. Giselle quickly becomes lost. Meanwhile, Robert, a divorce lawyer, prepares to propose to his longtime girlfriend Nancy, much to the dismay of his daughter Morgan. Robert and Morgan encounter Giselle on their way home, and Robert begrudgingly allows Giselle to stay the night at their apartment at the insistence of Morgan, who trusts Giselle.\n\nPip, Giselle's best chipmunk friend from Andalasia, had witnessed Giselle's exile and alerted Edward thereafter, and both embark on a rescue mission to the city, where they too are turned into 3D live-action versions, but Pip is instead in the form of a real chipmunk – therefore losing the ability to speak. Narissa sends Nathaniel to follow and impede Edward. In a restaurant, Narissa appears to Nathaniel in a soup pot and gives him three poisoned apples to murder Giselle. Pip eavesdrops but is unable to communicate with Edward, as animals cannot speak outside of Andalasia. Nathaniel keeps Pip silenced by detaining him in various containers. Meanwhile, after Giselle summons vermin to clean Robert's apartment, Nancy arrives to take Morgan to school. She meets Giselle and leaves assuming Robert was unfaithful. Robert is initially upset but spends the day with Giselle, knowing she is vulnerable in the city. Giselle questions Robert about his relationship with Nancy and helps the pair reconcile by sending Nancy an invitation to the \"King and Queen's Costume Ball\" at the Woolworth Building.\n\nEdward locates Giselle at Robert's apartment. While Edward is eager to take Giselle home to Andalasia and finally marry, she suggests that they should first go on a date to get to know each other better, still conflicted about her feelings. Giselle promises to return to Andalasia after ending their date at the ball, which Robert and Nancy also attend. Narissa, who has been spying from Andalasia, decides to follow and kill Giselle herself after Nathaniel failed to poison her twice. Robert and Giselle share a dance with each other and look into each other's eyes, romantically. Giselle and Edward then prepare to leave, but Giselle feels sorrow at leaving Robert behind. Narissa appears as the old hag and offers the last poisoned apple to Giselle, promising \"sweet dreams and happy endings.\" Giselle takes a bite and is rendered unconscious.\n\nNarissa attempts to escape with Giselle's body but is stopped by Edward. Nathaniel, realizing Narissa was using him and never loved him, reveals her plot. Robert realizes that true love's kiss is the only force powerful enough to break the apple's spell. After Edward's kiss fails to wake Giselle, he prompts Robert to do so instead. When Robert kisses her just as the clock strikes twelve, Giselle awakens and the whole crowd cheers. Narissa furiously transforms into a giant blue dragon and takes Robert hostage. Giselle takes Edward's sword and pursues Narissa to the top of the building. Pip, who was freed by Edward, helps Giselle send Narissa falling to her death.\n\nA happy new life unfolds for everyone, showing Edward and Nancy marrying in Andalasia; Giselle running a successful fashion business and forming a happy family with Robert and Morgan; while Nathaniel and Pip each become successful authors about their personal experiences in the real world.\n\nSeveral actresses/actors who have played characters in Disney films have cameos:\n\nThe initial script of \"Enchanted\", written by Bill Kelly, was bought by Disney's Touchstone Pictures and Sonnenfeld/Josephson Productions for a reported sum of $450,000 in September 1997. The script was written for three years, but it was thought to be unsuitable for Walt Disney Pictures because it was \"a racier R-rated movie\", inspired by the adult-risque comedy movies in the 1980s and 1990s such as \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\" and \"American Pie\". The first draft of the script had Giselle being mistaken for a stripper when she arrives in New York City. To the frustration of Kelly, the screenplay was rewritten several times, first by Rita Hsiao and then by Todd Alcott. The film was initially scheduled to be released in 2002 with Rob Marshall as director but he withdrew due to \"creative differences\" between the producers and him. In 2001, director Jon Turteltaub was set to direct the film but he left soon after, later working with Disney and Jerry Bruckheimer on the \"National Treasure\" franchise. Adam Shankman became the film's director in 2003, while Bob Schooley and Mark McCorkle were hired by Disney to rewrite the script once again. At the time, Disney considered offering the role of Giselle to Kate Hudson or Reese Witherspoon. However, the project did not take off.\n\nOn May 25, 2005, \"Variety\" reported that Kevin Lima had been hired as director and Bill Kelly had returned to the project to write a new version of the script. Lima worked with Kelly on the script to combine the main plot of \"Enchanted\" with the idea of a \"loving homage\" to Disney's heritage. He created visual storyboard printouts that covered the story of \"Enchanted\" from beginning to end, which filled an entire floor of a production building. After Lima showed them to Dick Cook, the chairman of the Walt Disney Studios, he received the green light for the project and a budget of $85 million. Lima began designing the world of Andalasia and storyboarding the movie before a cast was chosen to play the characters. After the actors were hired, he was involved in making the final design of the movie, which made sure the animated characters look like their real-life counterparts.\n\n\"Enchanted\" is the first feature-length Disney live-action/traditional animation hybrid since Disney's \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" in 1988, though the traditionally animated characters do not interact in the live-action environment in the same method as they did in \"Roger Rabbit\"; however, there are some scenes where live-action characters share the screen with two-dimensional animated characters, for example, a live-action Nathaniel communicating with a cel-drawn Narissa, who is in a cooking pot. The film uses two aspect ratios; it begins in 2.35:1 when the Walt Disney Pictures logo and \"Enchanted\" storybook are shown, and then switches to a smaller 1.85:1 aspect ratio for the first animated sequence. The film switches back to 2.35:1 when it becomes live-action and never switches back, even for the remainder of the cartoon sequences. When this movie was aired on televised networks, the beginning of the movie (minus the logo and opening credits) was shown in the pillarboxed 4:3 aspect ratio; the remainder of the movie was shown in the 16:9 aspect ratio when it becomes live-action. Lima oversaw the direction of both the live-action and animation sequences, which were being produced at the same time. \"Enchanted\" took almost two years to complete. The animation took about a year to finish while the live-action scenes, which commenced filming on location in New York City during the summer of 2006 and were completed during the animation process, were shot in 72 days.\n\nOut of the film's 107 minutes of running time, ten of the approximately 13 minutes of animation are at the beginning of the film. Lima tried to \"cram every single piece of Disney iconic imagery\" that he could into the first ten minutes, which were done in traditional cel animation (in contrast to computer-generated 3-D animation) as a tribute to past Disney fairy tale films such as \"Sleeping Beauty\", \"Cinderella\", and \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\". It was the first Disney film theatrically released in America to feature traditional cel animation since \"Pooh's Heffalump Movie\" (2005). This film, although quite different in terms of plot from any previous Disney film, also contained obvious homages to other Disney films of the distant past, such as \"Old Yeller\", \"The Shaggy Dog\", \"Swiss Family Robinson\", \"Bon Voyage!\", and \"Savage Sam\". As most of Disney's cel animation artists were laid off after the computer graphics boom of the late 1990s, the 13 minutes of animation were not done in-house but by the independent Pasadena-based company James Baxter Animation, which was started by noted lead animator James Baxter. Baxter had previously worked for Walt Disney Animation Studios, bringing to life many memorable Disney animated characters like Jessica Rabbit (\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\"), Belle (\"Beauty and the Beast\"), Rafiki (\"The Lion King\"), and Quasimodo (\"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\").\n\nAlthough Lima wanted the animation to be nostalgic, he wanted \"Enchanted\" to have a style of its own. Baxter's team decided to use Art Nouveau as a starting point. For Giselle, the hand-drawn animated character had to be \"a cross between Amy Adams and a classic Disney princess. And not a caricature.\" Seeing Giselle as \"a forest girl, an innocent nymph with flowers in her hair\" and \"a bit of a hippie\", the animators wanted her to be \"flowing, with her hair and clothes. Delicate.\" For Prince Edward, Baxter's team \"worked the hardest on him to make him look like the actor\" because princes \"in these kinds of movies are usually so bland.\" Many prototypes were made for Narissa as Baxter's team wanted her face to \"look like Susan Sarandon. And the costumes had to align closely to the live-action design.\"\n\nTo maintain continuity between the two media, Lima brought in costume designer Mona May during the early stages of the film's production so the costumes would be aligned in both the animated and live-action worlds. He also shot some live-action footage of Amy Adams as Giselle for the animators to use as reference, which also allowed the physical movement of the character to match in both worlds. Test scenes completed by the animators were shown to the actors, allowing them to see how their animated selves would move.\n\nPrincipal photography began in April 2006 and ended in July 2006. Because of the sequence setting, the live action scenes were filmed in New York City. However, shooting in New York became problematic as it was in a \"constant state of new stores, scaffolding and renovation\".\n\nThe first scene in New York, which features Giselle emerging from a manhole in the middle of Times Square, was filmed on location in the center of the square. Because of the difficulties in controlling the crowd while filming in Times Square, general pedestrians were featured in the scene with hired extras placed in the immediate foreground. Similarly, a crowd gathered to watch as James Marsden and Timothy Spall filmed their scenes in Times Square. However, the scene Lima found the most challenging to shoot was the musical number, \"That's How You Know\", in Central Park. The five-minute scene took 17 days to finish due to the changing weather, which allowed only seven sunny days for the scene to be filmed. The filming was also hampered at times by Patrick Dempsey's fans. The scene was choreographed by John O'Connell, who had worked on \"Moulin Rouge!\" beforehand, and included 300 extras and 150 dancers.\n\nMany scenes were filmed at Steiner Studios, which provided the three large stages that \"Enchanted\" needed at the same facility. Other outdoor locations included the Brooklyn Bridge and The Paterno, an apartment building with a curved, heavily embellished, ivory-colored façade located on the corner of Riverside Drive and 116th Street, which is the residence of the film's characters Robert and Morgan.\n\nAll the costumes in the film were designed by Mona May, who had previously worked on \"Clueless\", \"The Wedding Singer,\" and \"The Haunted Mansion\". To create the costumes, May spent one year in pre-production working with animators and her costume department of 20 people, while she contracted with five outside costume shops in Los Angeles and New York City. She became involved in the project during the time when the animators were designing the faces and bodies of the characters as they had to \"translate the costumes from two-dimensional drawings to live-action human proportion\". Her goal was to keep the designs \"Disneyesque to the core but bring a little bit of fashion in there and humor and make it something new\". However, May admitted this was difficult \"because they're dealing with iconic Disney characters who have been in the psyche of the viewing audience for so long\".\n\nFor the character of Giselle, her journey to becoming a real woman is reflected in her dresses, which become less fairy tale–like as the film progresses. Her wedding dress at the beginning of the film directly contrasts her modern gown at the end of the film. The wedding dress served to provide a \"humongous contrast to the flat drawings\" and to accentuate the image of a Disney Princess. In order to make the waist look small, the sleeves are designed to be \"extremely pouffy\" and the skirt to be as big as possible, which included a metal hoop that holds up 20 layers of petticoats and ruffles. Altogether, eleven versions of the dress are made for filming, each made of 200 yards (183 m) of silk satin and other fabric, and weighing approximately 40 pounds (18 kg). On the experience of wearing the wedding dress, Amy Adams described it as \"grueling\" since \"the entire weight was on her hips, so occasionally it felt like she was in traction\".\n\nUnlike Giselle, Prince Edward does not adapt to the real world and James Marsden, who plays Edward, had only one costume designed for him. May's aim was to try \"not to lose Marsden in the craziness of the outfit... where he still looks handsome\". The costume also included padding in the chest, buttocks, and crotch, which gave Marsden the \"same exaggerated proportions as an animated character\" and \"posture – his back is straight, the sleeves are up and never collapse\".\n\nMay was delighted that Lima \"went for something more fashion-forward\" with Susan Sarandon's Queen Narissa. She decided to make her look like a \"runway lady\", wearing something that is \"still Disney\" but also \"high fashion, like something John Galliano or Thierry Mugler might design\". Since Narissa appears in three media: hand drawn animation, live-action, and computer animation, May had to make sure that the costume would be the same throughout in terms of \"color, shape, and texture\". The costume for Narissa consisted of a leather corset and skirt, which looked \"reptilian\", as well as a cape. Working with the animators, May incorporated parts of the dragon's form into the costume; the cape was designed to look like wings, the layers of the skirt wrap around like a tail and a crown that would turn into horns during Narissa's transformation into a dragon.\n\nThe film's score was written by accomplished songwriter and composer Alan Menken, who has worked on a number of Disney films previously. Fellow composer Stephen Schwartz wrote the lyrics for six songs, also composed by Menken. Menken and Schwartz previously worked together on the songs for \"Pocahontas\" and \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\".\n\nMenken became involved with the film in the early stages of the film's development and invited Schwartz to resume their collaboration. They began the songwriting process by searching for the right moments in the story in which a song moment was allowed. Schwartz found that it was easier to justify situations in which the characters would burst into songs in \"Enchanted\" than in other live-action musicals as its concept \"allowed the characters to sing in a way that was completely integral to the plot of the story.\" The three songs Giselle sings contain references to earlier Disney films. The first song played in the film, \"True Love's Kiss\", was written to be \"a send-up of, and an homage to, the style of those Disney animated features\", namely, \"I'm Wishing\" (\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\") and \"A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes\" (\"Cinderella\"), during which Disney heroines sing about the joy of being loved. It posed a challenge for Menken and Schwartz because of the \"many preconceptions with that number\"; it had to be reflective of the era of \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" and \"Cinderella\". Accordingly, Amy Adams performed the first song in an operetta style in contrast to the Broadway style of the later songs.\n\nBoth \"Happy Working Song\" and \"That's How You Know\" also pay tributes to past Disney songs. \"Happy Working Song\" pays a lyrical homage to such songs as \"Whistle While You Work\" (\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\"), \"The Work Song\" (\"Cinderella\"), \"A Spoonful of Sugar\" (\"Mary Poppins\") and \"Making Christmas\" (\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\"), and a musical homage to the Sherman Brothers (with a self-parodic \"Alan Menken style\" middle eight). \"That's How You Know\" is a self-parody of Menken's compositions for his Disney features, specifically such big production numbers as \"Under the Sea\" (\"The Little Mermaid\") and \"Be Our Guest\" (\"Beauty and the Beast\"). To achieve this, Schwartz admitted he had to \"push it a little bit further in terms of choices of words or certain lyrics\" while maintaining \"the classic Walt Disney sensibility\". However, Menken noted that the songs he has written for Disney have always been \"a little tongue-in-cheek\". As the film progresses, the music uses more contemporary styles, which is heard through the adult ballad \"So Close\" and the country/pop number \"Ever Ever After\" (sung by Carrie Underwood as a voice-over).\n\nOut of the six completed songs written and composed by Menken and Schwartz, five remained in the finished film. The title song, \"Enchanted,\" a duet featuring Idina Menzel and James Marsden, was the only song of Menken's and Schwartz's authorship and composition that was deleted from the movie.\n\nThe majority of the visual effects shots in \"Enchanted\" were done by Tippett Studio in Berkeley, California, who contributed a total of 320 shots. These shots involved virtual sets, environmental effects and CG characters that performed alongside real actors, namely the animated animals during the \"Happy Working Song\" sequence, Pip and the Narissa dragon during the live-action portions of the film. CIS Hollywood was responsible for 36 visual effects shots, which primarily dealt with wire removals and composites. Reel FX Creative Studios did four visual effects shots involving the pop-up book page-turn transitions while Weta Digital did two.\n\nOut of all the animals that appear in the \"Happy Working Song\" sequence, the only real animals filmed on set were rats and pigeons. The real animals captured on film aided Tippett Studio in creating CG rats and pigeons, which gave dynamic performances such as having pigeons that carried brooms in their beaks and rats that scrubbed with toothbrushes. On the other hand, all the cockroaches were CG characters.\n\nPip, a chipmunk who can talk in the 2D world of Andalasia, loses his ability to communicate through speech in the real world so he must rely heavily on facial and body gestures. This meant the animators had to display Pip's emotions through performance as well as making him appear like a real chipmunk. The team at Tippett began the process of animating Pip by observing live chipmunks which were filmed in motion from \"every conceivable angle\", after which they created a photorealistic chipmunk through the use of 3D computer graphics software, Maya and Furrocious. When visual effects supervisor Thomas Schelesny showed the first animation of Pip to director Kevin Lima, he was surprised that he was a looking at a CG character and not reference footage. To enhance facial expressions, the modelers gave Pip eyebrows, which real chipmunks do not have. During the filming of scenes in which Pip appears, a number of ways were used to indicate the physical presence of Pip. On some occasions, a small stuffed chipmunk with a wire armature on the inside was placed in the scene. In other situations, a rod with a small marker on the end or a laser pointer would be used to show the actors and cinematographer where Pip is.\n\nUnlike Pip, the Narissa dragon was allowed to be more of a fantasy character while still looking like a living character and a classic Disney villain. The CG dragon design was loosely based on a traditional Chinese dragon and Susan Sarandon's live-action witch. When filming the scene which sees the transformation of Narissa from a woman into a dragon, a long pole was used to direct the extras' eyelines instead of a laser pointer. Set pieces were made to move back and forth in addition to having a computer-controlled lighting setup and a repeatable head on the camera that were all synchronized. In the film's final sequence, in which Narissa climbs the Woolworth Building while clutching Robert in her claws, a greenscreen rig was built to hold Patrick Dempsey in order to film his face and movements. The rig was a \"puppeteering\" approach that involved a robotic arm being controlled by three different floor effects artists.\n\nThe film was distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures to 3,730 theaters in the United States. It was distributed worldwide by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures International to over 50 territories around the world and topped the box office in several countries including the United Kingdom and Italy. It is the first movie to be released under the Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures name following the retirement of the previous Buena Vista Pictures Distribution.\n\nDisney had originally planned to add Giselle to the Disney Princess line-up, as was shown at a 2007 Toy Fair where the Giselle doll was featured with packaging declaring her with Disney Princess status, but decided against it when they realized they would have to pay for lifelong rights to Amy Adams' image. While Giselle is not being marketed as one of the Disney Princesses, \"Enchanted\" merchandise was made available in various outlets with Adams' animated likeness being used on all Giselle merchandise. Giselle led the 2007 Hollywood Holly-Day Parade at Disney's Hollywood Studios. She was also featured in the 2007 Walt Disney World Christmas Day Parade in the Magic Kingdom with the official Disney Princesses.\n\nA video game based on the film was released for Nintendo DS and mobile phones in addition to a Game Boy Advance title, \"Enchanted: Once Upon Andalasia\", which is a prequel to the film, about Giselle and Pip rescuing Andalasia from a magic spell.\n\n\"Enchanted\" was released on Blu-ray Disc and DVD by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on March 18, 2008, in the United States. While \"Enchanted\" topped the DVD sales chart on the week of its release in the United States, narrowly defeating the DVD sales of \"I Am Legend\", the Blu-ray Disc sales of \"I Am Legend\" were nearly four times the number of Blu-ray Disc sales of \"Enchanted\". The DVD was released in United Kingdom and Europe on April 7, 2008, and in Australia on May 21, 2008.\n\nThe bonus features included on both the DVD and Blu-ray Disc are \"Fantasy Comes to Life\", a three-part behind-the-scenes feature including \"Happy Working Song\", \"That's How You Know\" and \"A Blast at the Ball\"; six deleted scenes with brief introductions by director Kevin Lima; bloopers; \"Pip's Predicament: A Pop-Up Adventure\", a short in pop-up storybook style; and Carrie Underwood's music video for \"Ever Ever After\". Featured on the Blu-ray disc only is a trivia game titled \"The D Files\" that runs throughout the movie with high scoring players given access to videos \"So Close\", \"Making Ever Ever After\" and \"True Love's Kiss\". In the United States, certain DVDs at Target stores contain a bonus DVD with a 30-minute-long making-of documentary titled \"Becoming Enchanted: A New Classic Comes True\". This DVD is also sold with certain DVDs at HMV stores in the United Kingdom.\n\n\"Enchanted\" earned $8 million on the day of its release in the United States, placing at #1. It was also placed at #1 on Thanksgiving Day, earning $6.7 million to bring its two-day total to $14.6 million. The film grossed $14.4 million on the following day, bringing its total haul to $29.0 million placing ahead of other contenders. \"Enchanted\" made $34.4 million on the Friday-Sunday period in 3,730 theaters for a per location average of $9,472 and $49.1 million over the five-day Thanksgiving holiday in 3,730 theaters for a per location average of $13,153. Its earnings over the five-day holiday exceeded projections by $7 million. Ranking as the second-highest Thanksgiving opening after \"Toy Story 2\", which earned $80.1 million over the five-day holiday in 1999, \"Enchanted\" is the first film to open at #1 on the Thanksgiving frame in the 21st century.\n\nIn its second weekend, \"Enchanted\" was also the #1 film, grossing a further $16.4 million at 3,730 locations for a per theater average of $4,397. It dropped to #2 in its third weekend, with a gross of $10.7 million in 3,520 theaters for a per theater average of $3,042. It finished its fourth weekend at #4 with a gross of $5.5 million in 3,066 locations for a per theater average of $1,804. \"Enchanted\" earned a gross of $127.8 million in the United States and Canada as well a total of $340.5 million worldwide. It was the 15th highest-grossing film worldwide released in 2007.\n\n, the movie review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes had tallied the film at an overall 93% approval rating based on 189 reviews with an average score of 7.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"A smart re-imagining of fairy tale tropes that's sure to delight children and adults, \"Enchanted\" features witty dialogue, sharp animation, and a star turn by Amy Adams.\" Metacritic gave it a rating of 75 out of 100 based on 32 reviews. Rotten Tomatoes ranked the film as the ninth best reviewed film in wide release of 2007 and named it the best family film of 2007.\nPositive reviews praised the film's take on a classic Disney story, its comedy and musical numbers as well as the performance of its lead actress, Amy Adams. Roger Ebert of \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film three stars out of four, describing it as a \"heart-winning musical comedy that skips lightly and sprightly from the lily pads of hope to the manhole covers of actuality\" and one that \"has a Disney willingness to allow fantasy into life\". Film critics of \"Variety\" and \"LA Weekly\" remarked on the film's ability to cater for all ages. \"LA Weekly\" described the film as \"the sort of buoyant, all-ages entertainment that Hollywood has been laboring to revive in recent years (most recently with \"Hairspray\") but hasn't managed to get right until now\" while Todd McCarthy of \"Variety\" commented, \"More than Disney's strictly animated product, \"Enchanted\", in the manner of the vast majority of Hollywood films made until the '60s, is a film aimed at the entire population – niches be damned. It simply aims to please, without pandering, without vulgarity, without sops to pop-culture fads, and to pull this off today is no small feat.\" \"Enchanted\" was the Broadcast Film Critics Association's choice for Best Family Film of 2007 while Carrie Rickey of \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" named it the 4th best film of 2007.\n\n\"Rolling Stone\", \"Premiere\", \"USA Today\", and \"The Boston Globe\" all gave the film three out of four, while \"Baltimore Sun\" gave the film a B grade. They cited that although the story is relatively predictable, the way in which the predictability of the film is part of the story, the amazingly extravagant musical numbers, along with the way in which Disney pokes fun at its traditional line of animated movies outweighs any squabbles about storyline or being unsure of what age bracket the film is made for. Michael Sragow of \"Baltimore Sun\" remarked that the film's \"piquant idea and enough good jokes to overcome its uneven movie-making and uncertain tone\", while Claudia Puig of \"USA Today\" stated that \"though it's a fairly predictable fish-out-of-water tale (actually a princess-out-of-storybook saga), the casting is so perfect that it takes what could have been a ho-hum idea and renders it magical.\"\n\nAmy Adams herself garnered many favorable reviews. Reviewers praised her singing ability and asserted that her performance, which was compared by some to her Academy Award-nominated performance in \"Junebug\", has made Adams a movie star, likening it to \"Mary Poppins\" effect on Julie Andrews' career. Similarly, film critics Richard Roeper and Michael Phillips, who gave the film positive reviews on \"At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper\", emphasized the effect of Adams' performance on the film with remarks like \"Amy Adams is this movie\" and \"Amy Adams shows how to make a comic cliché work like magic.\" However, both agreed that the final sequence involving the computer-generated dragon \"bogged down\" the film.\n\n\"Empire\" stated that the film was targeted at children but agreed with other reviewers that the \"extremely game cast\" was the film's best asset. It gave the film three out of five. \"TIME\" gave the film a C-, stating that the film \"cannibalizes Walt's vault for jokes\" and \"fails to find a happy ending that doesn't feel two-dimensional\". Similarly, Peter Bradshaw of \"The Guardian\" commented that the film \"assumes a beady-eyed and deeply humourless sentimentality\" and that Adams' performance was the \"only decent thing in this overhyped family movie covered in a cellophane shrink-wrap of corporate Disney plastic-ness\". Bradshaw gave the film two out of five.\n\nAccording to director Kevin Lima, \"thousands\" of references are made to past and future works of Disney in \"Enchanted\", which serve as both a parody of and a \"giant love letter to Disney classics\". It took almost eight years for Walt Disney Studios to greenlight the production of the film because it \"was always quite nervous about the tone in particular\". As Lima worked with Bill Kelly, the writer, to inject Disney references to the plot, it became \"an obsession\"; he derived the name of every character as well as anything that needed a name from past Disney films to bring in more Disney references.\n\nWhile Disney animators have occasionally inserted a Disney character into background shots – for example, Donald Duck appears in a crowd in \"The Little Mermaid\" – they have avoided \"mingling characters\" from other Disney films for fear of weakening their individual mythologies. In \"Enchanted\", characters from past Disney films are openly seen, such as the appearances of Thumper and Flower from \"Bambi\" in the 2D animation portion of the film. Disney references are also made through camera work, sets, costumes, music and dialogue. Obvious examples include the use of poisoned apples from \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" and True Love's Kiss from \"Snow White\" and \"Sleeping Beauty\". Dick Cook, the chairman of Walt Disney Studios, admitted that part of the goal of \"Enchanted\" was to create a new franchise (through the character of Giselle) and to revive the older ones.\n\nIn February 2010, \"Variety\" reported that Walt Disney Pictures planned to film a sequel with Barry Josephson and Barry Sonnenfeld producing again. Jessie Nelson was attached to write the screenplay and Anne Fletcher to direct. Disney hoped the cast members from the first film would return and for a release as early as 2011.\n\nOn January 12, 2011, composer Alan Menken was asked about the sequel in an interview. His reply was, \"I've heard things but there's nothing yet. I don't know much about what's happening with that. Honestly, I don't know what the studio wants to do next. I presume there will be some future projects for me to work on. I love doing that, I really do. But I'm not frustrated that it isn't one of them. At the moment I have a lot of stage things happening and I'm busy enough with that, so I really don't need more on my plate.\"\n\nOn March 28, 2011, in an interview for his latest film, \"Hop\", James Marsden was asked about the sequel.\n\n, Disney had hired screenwriters J. David Stem and David N. Weiss to write a script for a sequel and also hired Fletcher to direct the film. In October 2016, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" reported that Adam Shankman entered negotiations to direct the sequel, titled \"Disenchanted\", and that Adams would reprise her role with filming originally scheduled to begin in summer 2017. In January 2018, Shankman stated that the sequel's script would be finished within a couple of weeks and the next step would be to get the music written. He also went on to say that the film would feature more songs than the original but the same amount of animation. Two months later, Shankman announced that Menken and Stephen Schwartz would return to write songs for the film.\n\n"}

{"id": "4043715", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4043715", "title": "Faroese art", "text": "Faroese art\n\nFaroese art is art by artists living in the Faroe Islands and art by Faroese nationals living abroad. In the Faroe Islands, art is an important part of everyday life and in the public debate. It may be the special light in the Faroes which causes so many to express themselves in painting. The ever-changing Faroese weather and light provide opportunities for endless nuances, something which has fascinated both foreign and local artists over the years. However, the history of Faroese art is short, and can only be dated a couple of hundred years back. Lack of time, light and materiel may have caused the late appearance of painting. But despite this, the islands have a very active art scene. A great many of the Faroese artists of today resent being reminded that Faroese art is a comparatively recent phenomenon. They find such an observation annoying as regards their artistic work, and they claim that such a statement has no bearing whatsoever on them as artists as their frame of reference is both local and global.\n\nWith the first Faroese painters the landscape became a national icon and it has remained the central topic in Faroese visual art. The grip that Faroese art, motifically speaking, takes on the Faroese landscape might seem to be a rather old-fashioned approach to visual art. The interest in installations, minimalism and conceptual art, has so far not affected Faroese art much. The village by the ocean is probably the motif which has been repeated the most. Danish art critic Ole Nørlyng concludes that nature, the wild landscape, is the driving force behind Faroese artists, but except for a close affinity with the landscape and culture of the islands, there has always been great diversity in Faroese art.\n\nThe first paintings art historians are familiar with are those by Díðrikur í Kárastovu. He was a farmer who commonly was known as Díðrikur á Skarvanesi (1802–1865). Díðrikur was settled in a small village, Skarvanes, on the island Sandoy. His subjects were real and imaginary birds in vivid colours. Although not in perfect condition, five of his paintings have been preserved. They are a feature in the permanent exhibition at the national Faroese art museum, Listasavn Føroya. One of his better paintings is entitled \"Moon Doves\".\n\nNiels Kruse (1871–1951) was the first Faroese landscape painter, a theme which was to become a most common motif in Faroese art. Kruse lived in the village Eiði on the island Eysturoy. Kruse was almost completely self-taught. He was fortunate enough to receive some help and advice from an American explorer, Elizabeth Taylor, who stayed in the Faroes in 1895. In 1924 one of his works was accepted by a gallery in Denmark. This marked a turning point in Faroese art history, as this was the first time ever a painter had succeeded outside of the Islands. Kruse even managed to make a living from his painting, again something which earlier had been unheard of.\n\nThere were some other painters from this early generation. Both Kristin í Geil and Jógvan Waagstein are worth mentioning. Both of them were well settled in Tórshavn. And again, these two were self-taught landscape painters. As was the case with Kruse, Waagstein received knowledge and advice from Elizabeth Taylor. Later on í Geil received some schooling from Kruse. These two latter, however, never made their living exclusively from painting.\n\nThese painters were all pioneers in the field of visual art in the Faroes, and they helped to make their fellow countrymen aware of the art of painting. The late 19th century marks the beginning of a Faroese art tradition slowly developing for the first time. There are several reasons for this being so. The arrival of Elizabeth Taylor with her knowledge of art helped to inspired several to start painting. And most importantly the late 19th century sparked the beginning of the national movement. The national revival brought with it the love of the landscape - a brand new theme which was to become a national icon, more so than anywhere in visual art. The theme came to dominate all through the 20th century.\n\nWith the first painters, the love and affection of the homeland was obvious, and still in the 21st Century the theme is being treated by a new generation of artists. However, several painters contributed to Faroese artists developing a passion for many different styles and subjects.\n\nThe real history of Faroese art starts in 1927, when three young artists held an exhibition in Tórshavn. Two of these were Sámal Joensen-Mikines (1906–1979) and William Heinesen (1900–1990).\n\nThe first, Mikines, came to be known as the father of Faroese art and the first Faroese artist to become internationally recognised. More importantly he was the very first Faroese artist to acquire an artistic degree. Mikines began his education at the Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen in 1928 with Aksel Jørgensen and Ejnar Nielsen as his teachers. Mikines was artistically highly inspired by the Norwegian artist Edvard Munch, and had a great admiration for El Greco and Delacroix. His early paintings are naturalistic, but later he became an expressive figurative painter. He was very original in his choice of colour and design. Mikines demonstrated a new approach to substance and form in painting which had a profound influence on Faroese art. He painted funerals, steep mountains and landscapes. His paintings of pilot whaling became important to future artists. He introduced the possibility of allowing the landscape to mirror the painter´s inner life.\n\nWilliam Heinesen was a very different type of artist. Literature was his vocation. Although he considered himself an amateur in visual art, he created some very important works in Faroese art. His imagery doesn't evolve around the landscape. Folktale, satire and everyday life are Heinesen's subjects.\n\nDuring this period a new era had begun in Faroese visual art. Mikines wasn't the only one from his generation who received his formal training in Copenhagen. Faroese art experienced a virtual blossoming after World War II, when several talented and productive artists returned to the Faroe Islands after finishing their studies in Denmark. The range of motifs and styles were greatly expanded.\n\nA new generation of artists, who had acquired artistic degrees didn't want to use their art for the sole purpose of expressing their love for their country. The ones who followed included the classical modernist Janus Kamban (1913–2009), the colourist Ruth Smith (1913–1958), the graphical artist Elinborg Lützen (1915–1995) and the great abstract painter Ingálvur av Reyni (1920–2005). Together with Mikines and Heinesen, these are the mothers and fathers of Faroese art.\n\nThe common denomination “landscape expressionist” comprises a group of diverse artists, solely because the nature and landscape are central themes in their work. Zacharias Heinesen (1936), Thomas Arge (1942–1978), Tróndur Patursson (1943), Torbjørn Olsen (1956), Barður Jákupsson (1943) and Amariel Norðoy (1945) all belong to this group, as do many others.\nThis large generation of painters from the 1930´s to 1960´s has been able to find common stylistic expressions.\nThey exploit the full spectrum of the formal possibilities painting has to offer. They work with the unified whole and detail. Sometimes the subject matter almost disappears in the pure abstraction of the colours and forms, but rarely completely. A reminiscence of the landscape always remains. Not as a true-to-life reproduction, but as a landscape experience which is communicated via a variety of temperaments. So great has their contribution to Faroese art been that for a long time a genuine Faroese painting should preferably be a highly colouristic, expressive and semi abstract landscape, filled with North-Atlantic drama. It is not an unusual criticism that Faroese art relies too heavily on nature as a motif. But when the variety of expression is taken into account, the criticism doesn't seem fair.\n\nBut despite the light and distinct colours of nature and scenery, Faroese art is not exclusively landscape.\n\nThe landscape has been the national theme of Faroese painting, arguably as a collectively chosen shell around the core of modern painting. In recent years, however, other subjects have emerged and appear to be edging out the landscape. The common denominator for the younger generation of Faroese artists is that they all have managed to outline new directions for Faroese art, while at the same time, relating with insight to the Faroese landscape tradition. The interest in the human mind, existential or philosophical questions or the internal landscapes seems to rise. The postmodern interest in contemporary philosophy, mass media and politics has begun to appear in Faroese art, and has emerged concomitantly with its appearance in other countries. One of the artist working in this field is Ole Wich (1953), who has worked with cross media art on the internet connected to present political and culturel issues in the faroese society, as well as conceptuel pieces places between visual expression and science.\n\nThe Faroese visual art has hardly ever been as manifold as it is today, although the genre remains traditional painting. There is a lot of pessimism among the artists themselves. They are doubtful of the future of Faroese art and they fear that the small-scaled nature and isolation of Faroese art may prove to be insurmountable handicaps. In the long run, they say 50,000 people and a couple of dozen artists will not be able to sustain a living artistic culture. Naturally, there is a danger that it might stagnate and die from lack of nourishment. At the same time, it is difficult to see how things could go so wrong while the need is so great.\n\nThere are many young artists who are currently identifying new paths for Faroese art. The younger generation of Faroese artists has mainly chosen to reside abroad as has Hansina Iversen, who is based in Copenhagen and Hanni Bjartalíð in Helsinki.\n\nIn the Faroe Islands there is a great interest in buying Faroese art to decorate your home with. This appreciation means that it is easy to find art galleries round about the islands. Some galleries are dedicated to local artists, while others have regular exhibitions. But the number of art galleries is highest in Tórshavn.\n\nSeveral paintings by Faroese artists have been featured on stamps. All Faroese stamp editions are about items relating to the Faroes and most of them are designed by Faroese artists. Faroese art is among the main motifs, both in reproductions of important paintings and in involving the artists in drawing stamps.\n\n\n\n"}

Recently, the Nigerian fashion industry has developed more participants, exposure, structure, presence, earnings, and training. Many now work in the industry as clothing designers, fashion models, clothing stylists, fashion photographers, makeup artists, hair stylists, cosmetologists, and fashion journalists. Magazines devoted to fashion in Nigeria are now common. Nigeria's New Fashion Week has grown in attendance, with long streets dedicated to fashion retailers in the major cities of Nigeria.\n\nRecognition for Nigerian fashion has been slow in the global fashion industry, which is mostly based in North America and Europe. Many assume that Africans only wear traditional garb or using clothing solely functionally (to cover the body and protect it from environmental factors). Yet, in many African countries, clothes have historically been decorative as well as scarring, painting, tattooing, or jewelry.\n\nThere are definite distinctions between traditional Nigerian clothing and Western clothing in Nigeria. Traditional clothing signifies which ethnic group one belongs to, and can indicate one's gender, class, religion, and region. For instance, city and rural dwellers in Nigeria can easily distinguish Eastern Nigerian ways of dressing from Northern Nigerian or Western Nigerian ways. This is because the different lifestyles call for different clothing styles.\n\nNigerian traditional clothing has reflected the cultures of Nigeria's hundreds of ethnic groups. In pre-colonial times, Nigerians wore their traditional garb all of the time. In modern times, many Nigerians only wear traditional clothing for special occasions, or to work on Fridays, and also for religious gatherings e.g. in the church or the mosque.\n\nThe Edo People are made up of the Binis, Afemais, Esan, etc. The Benin Kingdom is one of the oldest and culturally rich pre-colonial African Kingdoms. Edo traditional clothing has lots of color and the people often use of beads, which symbolize royalty and freedom.\n\nThe Urhobo people and Isoko people are major ethnic groups in Nigeria's Delta State, migrants from the Edo nation, according to oral history. Combined, they make up the fifth largest ethnic group in Nigeria. They have very similar languages, cultures, and traditional clothing. Many wear Georgian wrappers and lace shirts, accessorized with cowboy hats, walking sticks, and beads on the hands and neck.\n\nThe Yoruba People occupy South Western and North-Central Nigeria, living in such states as Lagos, Oyo, Ekiti, Kwara, Kogi, Ondo, Ogun, and Osun. They are one of the three major ethnic groups of Nigeria. The Yoruba men traditionally wear a \"Buba\" and \"Sokoto\", sometimes with an \"Agbada\", an oversized cloth worn like a jacket and a \"Fila\", a traditional cap. Women on the other hand wear a \"Buba\" and \"Iro\" and tie a \"Gele\" over their heads and \"Ipele\" over the shoulders. The Gele and Ipele must match. \"Buba\" is like a shirt for men and a low round neck top for women.\n\nThe Igbo People—an umbrella term for groups such as Mbaise, Ika, Aniocha, Ikwerre(disputed), and Orlu—occupy South Eastern and parts of South-Southern Nigeria, living in such states as Anambra, Enugu, Imo, Abia, Ebonyi, Delta, and Rivers. The Igbo are one of the three major ethnic groups of Nigeria. The stereotype about Igbos is that they do well in business. The Igbo women dress like the Edo people, with beads. Some Igbo groups tie a white wrapper across their shoulders.\n\nThe Hausa people, Kanuri people, and Fulani people occupy Northern Nigeria. They have similar cultures, clothing, and languages. They are the largest grouping in Nigeria and make up the major ethnic group. The men dress with a Kaftan or Jalabiya.\nThe Efik people and Ibibio people occupy Akwa-Ibom and Cross-River States in South-Southern Nigeria, migrants from Cameroon in pre-colonial times, according to oral tradition. Their dress resembles that of the Igbo people, with some major differences.\n\nThe Ijaw people occupy Bayelsa, Rivers, Delta, Akwa-Ibom and Ondo States. They make up the fourth largest ethnic group in Nigeria. They have cultural similarities with the neighbouring Itsekiri and Urhobo/Isoko people and dress like them.\n\nThe Itsekiris are a minority ethnic group whose people occupy Delta South. Itsekiris live in Warri North, Warri South, Warri South West, and Sapele. The Itsekiris were originally Yoruba people, but migrated and mixed with the Edo, Urhobo, and Ijaw people as well as the Portuguese. Itsekiris dress like the Urhobos and Ijaws. Their royalty put on white with a colored girdle depending on the occasion.\n\nDuring colonialism and into the modern period, Nigerians slowly began to wear more and more Western clothes, including blouses, skirts, dress pants, and wigs, especially in schools and government jobs. Fashion in the rural areas has not changed much over this period, however.\n\nIn his 1971 song, \"Gentleman,\" Fela Kuti made fun of businessmen who rejected their native garb when they made became mildly successful, and only wore English suits, acting as though they were better than everyone else. He proudly declares, \"I no be gentleman at all-o, I be Africa man, original\" in his commentary on those who had inferiority complexes about their non-Western cultures and lost their roots.\n\nWith time, Nigerian fashion began to mirror its status as an independence nation. People began to wear their traditionally Nigerian outfits in urban areas and to work, church, and so on. Today, it is fairly uncommon for businessmen in Nigeria to wear English suits.\n\nWeaving in Nigeria is traced to Eastern Nigeria. Archaeological evidence of early textiles supposedly woven from brass and leaf fibers has been discovered and they date over a thousand years. But whether strips were woven simultaneously or individually is difficult to say, as no further evidence was available to corroborate this.\n\nKano cloths is the 1590s, was said to be used as currency. Researchers such as Barth (1851) observed that dyed and woven cotton were the main products of Kano. He described over 20 different kinds of cloth made in Kano and all its environs.\n\nDuring the later part of 1800s, locally woven fabrics were exported to other parts of Nigeria and other countries. This was sadly reduced by the large imports of printed cloth from England, which could be purchased more cheaply than hand-woven fabrics. Still, the hand woven cloth remains treasured for important ceremonies and events. This was bolstered by the nationalism generated by the independence in 1960.\n\nThere are two primary types of weaving done on two different types of looms, in Nigeria, especially in the Western region. While men and youth use a narrow, horizontal loom with meddles and treadles to weave strips of cloth infinite yardage, the women are primarily responsible for growing and processing the fibre for weaving. In towns like Oyo and Ilorin, the people plant, cultivate and harvest cotton fibres. They also spin and dye.\n\nAnkara fabric, not referring to the capital of Turkey of the same name, is a 100% cotton fabric filled with vibrant patterns and African motifs. It is commonly referred to as Dutch wax or Holland wax, African print, or African wax prints. Ankara print Fabrics are made through an Indonesian wax-resist dyeing technique called Batik.In this technique, methods are used to \"resist\" the dye from reaching all the cloth, thereby creating a pattern. The lack of divergence in color intensity helps with the determination of the (front) right and (back) wrong side of the fabric. Ankara print fabrics are most often sold in 12 yards as \"full piece\" or 6 yards as \"half piece\". The fabric company/producer, The type of fabric/product and registration number is printed on the selvage of the fabric, to notify people of the quality and to protect the designs from imitators.\n\nThe wax fabric can be sorted into categories of quality due to the processes of manufacturing. The colors comply with the local preferences of the costumers. Some wax prints can be named after personalities, cities, building, sayings or occasions. The Nigerian textile industry is very strong, and nearly all the cloth produced in Nigeria goes to clothing the large Nigerian population.\n\nAnkara Print fabrics can be worn for both regular outings, and some people wear it as \"aso ebi\" for special occasions such as birthday celebrations, weddings, balls, etc. Aso ebi is a Yoruba word and means \"clothes of the family\". Family members, relatives and close friends usually dress up in the same print for a special occasion.\n\nThere has also been a reawakening of Nigerians to fashionably embrace local fabrics like aso-oke, adire, and Nigerian wax. Some designers, like Ituen Basi, opt to only use Nigerian wax in their designs; she has even designed a line of ankara footwear, jewelry, bags, and accessories. This print craze recently caught on with the Western fashion world and this time, Africa, specifically Nigeria, has become a major muse.\n\nEmbroidery is like a stamp of African aesthetic on an outfit. Modern designs are given exotic embroidery patterns in order to marry western and African imprints. The history of embroidery in Nigeria dates back to centuries, and it has become integral part of Nigerian dressing. Among the Nupe and Hausa research has proved that embroidery has been a long tradition and it is used on many types of garments, from Hausa farmers cloths to riding robes and ceremonial apparels.\n\nThe embroidery done on men's clothes is traditionally made with dark stitches with asymmetrical and non-representational designs. Gorgeously, voluminous robes, intricately embroidered are a symbol of prestige and rank for men in Nupe and Hausa communities. Designs of the Nupe embroiders are well known and prized by Nupe and Hausa people. Three types of stitches are primarily used. They are the chain stitch, the buttonhole stitch and couching. The stitching is done with either imported or silk thread on either imported or hand-woven cloth. Often, silk thread in its own creamy color called Tsmia in Hausa is used for the most prestigious Rigona robes on hand-woven narrow band cloth which is most times, creamy in color.\n\nThere are still other types of embroidery designs in the country. These embroidered cloths are used as bedspread, tablecloth or wall hangings. Some artists say the colorful and cheerful cloths are the examples of \"folk art\". But the Hausa call it \"Hausa bridal sheets\". What is note worthy in these cloths is that the embroidery designs and traditional house decorations have similar motifs.\n\nEmbroidery was not also natural to the Igbo but surface designs for body paintings were easily converted to embroidery designs for table linens in the Igbo town of Arochukwu. Yoruba men have also used some embroidery on clothing, round the neck of their traditional agbada.\n\nThere was time in Nigeria when headgear popularly called \"gele\" (another Yoruba word) was almost compulsory for Nigerian women. In the 1950s and 1960s, gele was for the fashion diva of that time, the ultimate headgear. The women proudly wore gele to the admiration of other women from other climes.\n\nThe glory of gele was however, highest in 1960, the year of Independence. Lagos was agog that year and to reflect the festive mood, Nigerian women wasted no time in upgrading the fashion to catch the euphoria of the moment. Different headgears also came in with the euphoria one of which was Onilegororo. This was one of the sky-scrapping head gears and it marked a new level of sophistication and the status symbol for society women. Today the members of the wealthy elite are easily identifiable by their fancy clothing and hairstyles. Onilegororo, after the independence, was quickly replaced by Flora Azikiwe, the style, in honour of late First Lady and wife of the president of the new republic. From then, it became the vogue to name headgears after public edifices and personalities, from Nnamdi Azikiwe to Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi, Yakubu Gown, Eko Bridge and National Electric Power Authority (NEPA). NEPA, patterned after the statute of Sango, god of thunder and lightning, which is the logo for NEPA, came into being in the 70s as a mark of recognition of the once mighty corporation. In appreciation of the beauty and architectural excellence of the National Theatre, a replica was fashioned by the lists which became known is National Theatre headgear.\n\nBut after the euphoria of independence warned, the love for headgear waned too. By the 1980s, following the ban on importation, the inflow of headgears reduced dramatically and with it, the imagination of the ingenious stylists whose fort it was to come up will names and styles. The Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) played a significant role in demise of the gele. The fall of the national currency, the naira, forced the prices of gele out of the reach of the average Nigerian woman. The urge then was to satisfy the stomach. This out weighed the desire to spend some time for fashion, as it also required expensive accessory. Gele, to many people, became an occasional wear for Sundays, parties, weddings and other special occasions.\n\nThe changing circumstances in the affairs of the gele gave way to a deeper westernization of the average Nigerian teenager's dressing that very rarely do young women wear gele or traditional attire show in their wardrobe. So, while the gele is for grand occasions like the Christmas and special events, the vogue for her is the hat, the ultimate headpiece. The anger against this is not the appreciation of western dressing but the total rejection for what is African. This danger has perhaps, made some fashion hat designers create a modern version of the gele.\n\nFurther researches and studies in the art of hat making have led to the introduction of relevant and constant invitations. The innovations have made hats come to stay as part of modern Nigerian fashion, leading to introduction of \"group hats\", uniform hats. Hats are made of different materials such as cynamay, a soft material dyed into a variety of colors and shades. Cynamay can be moved, twisted and cut into different shapes. It is light and suitable for the African weather.\n\nThere are also straw hats, the knotted style and the pail boxes. Some are designed with feathers and flowers such as roses and ornament, like sequins. About 80 per cent of the materials are imported. But the preferred hat colors, many people say, are silver, gold and platinum. But hat the colors in vogue are hot pink, lemon and orange.\n\nNigerian publications such as \"Flair West Africa\" (formerly called \"True Love\" Magazine), \"Genevieve\", \"TW\" and \"Arise\"; websites like Stylehousefiles.com, Bellanaija.com, Ladybrille.com, Fashionafrica.com, Shopliquorice.blogspot.com, showcase and promote Nigerian fashion. Nigerian fashion has created female entrepreneurs and has improved the Nigerian economy by creating jobs and opportunities.\n\nThe Nigerian fashion industry according to designer Maki-Oh suffers from, \"Mediocrity, electricity [problems] and quality control.\" There are no bodies regulating the fashion industry and there are no government incentives to support new comers. There are issues of finishing which nearly every designer suffers from as most of them rely on self-taught tailors. The result is an expensive price tag for less than perfect products.\n\nHelen Jennings notes, \"the success of the new generation of designers, models and fashion scenes around Africa is a reflection of Africa's success as a whole. The continent is gradually emerging as a global power thanks to increased trade and investment between Africa and the rest of the world and improved political stability and economic growth in burgeoning democracies such as Nigeria.\"\n\nThe Fashion Designers Association of Nigeria (FADAN) is the recognized body for the Fashion Designers Profession and was duly incorporated in 1989 by the then Federal Ministry of Trade and Corporate Affairs. The formidable association of fashion designers now has state chapters all over the country.\n\nHere are some of the notable Nigerian fashion houses/centers of today:\n\nBorn of a Jamaican mother and a Nigerian father, Duro Olowo was raised in Lagos. He arrived on the London fashion scene in 2004 and has impressed the right people with his vibrant mix of African prints, seventies tailoring, and unlikely color combos. A high-waisted patchwork boho dress—known as the \"Duro\"—put the brand on the fashion map, and became a cult item in 2005 after being discovered by American \"Vogue\" editor Sally Singer and Julie Gilhart of Barneys.\n\nThe patterns and colors of his designs, which are sold to concept stores like Ikram in Chicago and Biffi in Milan, seem intrinsically African, but they are often European.\n\nSagoe began designing in 1989 and has gained international notoriety for her lively, and colorful designs. She was recently appointed to represent Nigeria in a new international campaign organized by the United Nations World Food Program. The campaign, titled \"Catwalk the World: Fashion for Food.\", began in Nigeria in April 2006 and recently staged an event in Ghana which brought celebrities like Damon Dash, his wife, designer Rachel Roy, and Ghanaian-born, London-based designer Ozwald Boateng. The campaign's goal is to raise money towards halving the number of hungry people in the world, particularly children, by 2015. Sagoe frequently exhibits her couture collection at Cape Town Fashion Week and has been an invited guest of New York Fashion Week in the past. Sagoe has won the \"Africa Designs\" and the MNET/ Anglo Gold African designs 2000 awards for which she was nominated by Andre Leon Tally, US \"Vogue\" editor.\n\nShe started her label \"Jewel by Lisa\" in 2005 from her home, after which she became an internationally recognised name and brand, having showrooms in Nigeria as well as New York. Her collections are also showcased in the US, the UK, Nigeria and South Africa. She won the Africa Fashion Award in 2012 and was featured in Vogue Italia, the holy grail of fashion worldwide. In 2015 she was featured in the prestigious BOF500, which is a list of fashion brands that are shaping the international fashion scene. She was one of a few Nigerians who made it on the list. Lisa Folawiyo has a background in law, which she studied at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka.\n\nOsakwe studied at the Arts University Bournemouth where she received a BA in fashion studies. In autumn/winter 2010 she launched her label. Inspired by rural Ghana's Dipo rites-of-passage ceremony, during which girls taking part are partially naked and ornately adorned, Osakwe has played with cloaking and ornamentation using traditional African fabrics. Recently her label was discovered by the U.S. fashion scene in 2012, when she presented her designs at the New York Fashion Week. She relates the legacy of their country with one, if they dyed their brands by hand with indigo leaves and painted the pattern with a paste made from cassava. Adire is the traditional method.\n\nInternational stars such as singers Beyoncé and Rihanna or Hollywood actress Kerry Washington have discovered the Nigerian designer outfits for themselves. U.S. First Lady, Michelle Obama, well-known being a style icon, wore during summer 2013 trip to South Africa a blouse of Nigerian designer Maki Oh. Her designs also have been worn by the likes of Solange Knowles and Leelee Sobieski and by Nigerian TV presenter Eku Edewor. One signature of her brand is that it's dyed by hand using the traditional textile arte process Adire. Another is her way of combining Western silhouettes and native materials and motifs—to wit, a lace-blouse-and-pencil-skirt set appliquéd with unsettling raffia eyeballs. She was named \"Designer of the Year\" by African fashion magazine ARISE.\n"}
{"id": "1022287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1022287", "title": "Feminist theory", "text": "Feminist theory\n\nFeminist theory is the extension of feminism into theoretical, fictional, or philosophical discourse. It aims to understand the nature of gender inequality. It examines women's and men's social roles, experiences, interests, chores, and feminist politics in a variety of fields, such as anthropology and sociology, communication, media studies, psychoanalysis, home economics, literature, education, and philosophy.\n\nFeminist theory focuses on analyzing gender inequality. Themes explored in feminism include discrimination, objectification (especially sexual objectification), oppression, patriarchy, stereotyping, art history and contemporary art, and aesthetics.\n\nFeminist theories first emerged as early as 1794 in publications such as \"A Vindication of the Rights of Woman\" by Mary Wollstonecraft, \"The Changing Woman\", \"Ain't I a Woman\", \"Speech after Arrest for Illegal Voting\", and so on. \"The Changing Woman\" is a Navajo Myth that gave credit to a woman who, in the end, populated the world. In 1851, Sojourner Truth addressed women's rights issues through her publication, \"Ain't I a Woman\". Sojourner Truth addressed the issue of women having limited rights due to men's flawed perception of women. Truth argued that if a woman of color can perform tasks that were supposedly limited to men, then any woman of any color could perform those same tasks. After her arrest for illegally voting, Susan B. Anthony gave a speech within court in which she addressed the issues of language within the constitution documented in her publication, \"Speech after Arrest for Illegal voting\" in 1872. Anthony questioned the authoritative principles of the constitution and its male gendered language. She raised the question of why women are accountable to be punished under law but they cannot use the law for their own protection (women could not vote, own property, nor themselves in marriage). She also critiqued the constitution for its male gendered language and questioned why women should have to abide by laws that do not specify women.\n\nNancy Cott makes a distinction between \"modern feminism\" and its antecedents, particularly the struggle for suffrage. In the United States she places the turning point in the decades before and after women obtained the vote in 1920 (1910–1930). She argues that the prior \"woman movement\" was primarily about woman as a \"universal\" entity, whereas over this 20-year period it transformed itself into one primarily concerned with social differentiation, attentive to \"individuality\" and diversity. New issues dealt more with woman's condition as a social construct, gender identity, and relationships within and between genders. Politically this represented a shift from an ideological alignment comfortable with the right, to one more radically associated with the left.\n\nSusan Kingsley Kent says that Freudian patriarchy was responsible for the diminished profile of feminism in the inter-war years, others such as Juliet Mitchell consider this to be\noverly simplistic since Freudian theory is not wholly incompatible with feminism. Some feminist scholarship shifted away from the need to establish the origins of family, and towards analyzing the process of patriarchy. In the immediate postwar period, Simone de Beauvoir stood in opposition to an image of \"the woman in the home\". De Beauvoir provided an existentialist dimension to feminism with the publication of \"Le Deuxième Sexe\" (The Second Sex) in 1949.\nAs the title implies, the starting point is the implicit inferiority of women, and the first question de Beauvoir asks is \"what is a woman\"?.\nWoman she realizes is always perceived of as the \"other\", \"\"she is defined and differentiated with reference to man and not he with reference to her\". In this book and her essay, \"Woman: Myth & Reality\", de Beauvoir anticipates Betty Friedan in seeking to demythologise the male concept of woman. \"A myth invented by men to confine women to their oppressed state. For women it is not a question of asserting themselves as women, but of becoming full-scale human beings\".\" \"One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman\", or as Toril Moi puts it \"a woman defines herself through the way she lives her embodied situation in the world, or in other words, through the way in which she makes something of what the world makes of her\". Therefore, woman must regain subject, to escape her defined role as \"other\", as a Cartesian point of departure.\nIn her examination of myth, she appears as one who does not accept any special privileges for women. Ironically, feminist philosophers have had to extract de Beauvoir herself from out of the shadow of Jean-Paul Sartre to fully appreciate her. While more philosopher and novelist than activist, she did sign one of the \"Mouvement de Libération des Femmes\" manifestos.\n\nThe resurgence of feminist activism in the late 1960s was accompanied by an emerging literature of concerns for the earth and spirituality, and environmentalism. This in turn created an atmosphere conducive to reigniting the study of and debate on matricentricity,\nas a rejection of determinism, such as Adrienne Rich\nand Marilyn French\nwhile for socialist feminists like Evelyn Reed,\npatriarchy held the properties of capitalism. Feminist psychologists, such as Jean Baker Miller, sought to bring a feminist analysis to previous psychological theories, proving that \"there was nothing wrong with women, but rather with the way modern culture viewed them\".\n\nElaine Showalter describes the development of feminist theory as having a number of phases. The first she calls \"feminist critique\" – where the feminist reader examines the ideologies behind literary phenomena. The second Showalter calls \"Gynocritics\" – where the \"woman is producer of textual meaning\" including \"the psychodynamics of female creativity; linguistics and the problem of a female language; the trajectory of the individual or collective female literary career and literary history\". The last phase she calls \"gender theory\" – where the \"ideological inscription and the literary effects of the sex/gender system\" are explored\". This model has been criticized by Toril Moi who sees it as an essentialist and deterministic model for female subjectivity. She also criticized it for not taking account of the situation for women outside the west.\nFrom the 1970s onwards, psychoanalytical ideas that have been arising in the field of French feminism have gained a decisive influence on feminist theory. Feminist psychoanalysis deconstructed the phallic hypotheses regarding the Unconscious. Julia Kristeva, Bracha Ettinger and Luce Irigaray developed specific notions concerning unconscious sexual difference, the feminine and motherhood, with wide implications for film and literature analysis.\n\nThere are a number of distinct feminist disciplines, in which experts in other areas apply feminist techniques and principles to their own fields. Additionally, these are also debates which shape feminist theory and they can be applied interchangeably in the arguments of feminist theorists.\n\nIn western thought, the body has been historically associated solely with women, whereas men have been associated with the mind. Susan Bordo, a modern feminist philosopher, in her writings elaborates the dualistic nature of the mind/body connection by examining the early philosophies of Aristotle, Hegel and Descartes, revealing how such distinguishing binaries such as spirit/matter and male activity/female passivity have worked to solidify gender characteristics and categorization. Bordo goes on to point out that while men have historically been associated with the intellect and the mind or spirit, women have long been associated with the body, the subordinated, negatively imbued term in the mind/body dichotomy.\nThe notion of the body (but not the mind) being associated with women has served as a justification to deem women as property, objects, and exchangeable commodities (among men). For example, women's bodies have been objectified throughout history through the changing ideologies of fashion, diet, exercise programs, cosmetic surgery, childbearing, etc. This contrasts to men's role as a moral agent, responsible for working or fighting in bloody wars.\nThe race and class of a woman can determine whether her body will be treated as decoration and protected, which is associated with middle or upper-class women's bodies. On the other hand, the other body is recognized for its use in labor and exploitation which is generally associated with women's bodies in the working-class or with women of color.\nSecond-wave feminist activism has argued for reproductive rights and choice, women's health (movement), and lesbian rights (movement) which are also associated with this Bodies debate.\n\nThe standard sex determination and gender model consists of evidence based on the determined sex and gender of every individual and serve as norms for societal life. The model claims that the sex-determination of a person exist within a male/female dichotomy giving importance to genitals and how they are formed via chromosomes, and DNA-binding proteins (such as the sex-determining region Y genes), which are responsible for sending sex-determined initialization and completion signals to and from the biological sex-determination system in fetuses. Occasionally, mutations occur during the sex-determining process. When this happens, the fetus becomes a hermaphrodite. The standard model defines gender as a social understanding/ideology that defines what behaviors, actions, and appearances are normal for males and females. Studies into biological sex-determining systems also have began working towards connecting certain gender conducts such as behaviors, actions, and desires with sex-determinism.\n\nSocially-biasing children sex and gender system\n\nThe socially-biasing children sex and gender model broadens the horizons of the sex and gender ideologies. It revises the ideology of sex to be a social construct which is not limited to either male or female. The Intersex Society of North America which explains that, \"nature doesn't decide where the category of 'male' ends and the category of 'intersex' begins, or where the category of 'intersex' ends and the category of 'female' begins. Humans decide. Humans (today, typically doctors) decide how small a penis has to be, or how unusual a combination of parts has to be, before it counts as intersex\". Therefore, sex is not a biological/natural construct but a social one instead since, society and doctors decide on what it means to be male, female, or intersex in terms of sex chromosomes and genitals, in addition to their personal judgment on who or how one passes as a specific sex. The ideology of gender remains a social construct but is not as strict and fixed. Instead, gender is easily malleable, and is forever changing. One example of where the standard definition of gender alters with time happens to be depicted in Sally Shuttleworth's \"Female Circulation\" in which the, \"abasement of the woman, reducing her from an active participant in the labor market to the passive bodily existence to be controlled by male expertise is indicative of the ways in which the ideological deployment of gender roles operated to facilitate and sustain the changing structure of familial and market relations in Victorian England\". In other words, this quote shows what it meant growing up into the roles of a female (gender/roles) changed from being a homemaker to being a working woman and then back to being passive and inferior to males. In conclusion, the contemporary sex gender model is accurate because both sex and gender are rightly seen as social constructs inclusive of the wide spectrum of sexes and genders and in which nature and nurture are interconnected.\n\nThe generation and production of knowledge has been an important part of feminist theory and is at the centre of discussions on feminist epistemology. This debate proposes such questions as \"Are there 'women's ways of knowing' and 'women's knowledge'?\" And \"How does the knowledge women produce about themselves differ from that produced by patriarchy?\" Feminist theorists have also proposed the \"feminist standpoint knowledge\" which attempts to replace the \"view from nowhere\" with the model of knowing that expels the \"view from women's lives\". A feminist approach to epistemology seeks to establish knowledge production from a woman's perspective. It theorizes that from personal experience comes knowledge which helps each individual look at things from a different insight.\n\nCentral to feminism is that women are systematically subordinated, and bad faith exists when women surrender their agency to this subordination, e.g., acceptance of religious beliefs that a man is the dominant party in a marriage by the will of God; Simone de Beauvoir labels such women \"mutilated\" and \"immanent\".\n\nIntersectionality is the examination of various ways in which people are oppressed, based on the relational web of dominating factors of race, sex, class, nation and sexual orientation. Intersectionality \"describes the simultaneous, multiple, overlapping, and contradictory systems of power that shape our lives and political options\". While this theory can be applied to all people, and more particularly all women, it is specifically mentioned and studied within the realms of black feminism. Patricia Hill Collins argues that black women in particular, have a unique perspective on the oppression of the world as unlike white women, they face both racial and gender oppression simultaneously, among other factors. This debate raises the issue of understanding the oppressive lives of women that are not only shaped by gender alone but by other elements such as racism, classism, ageism, heterosexism, ableism etc.\n\nIn this debate, women writers have addressed the issues of masculinized writing through male gendered language that may not serve to accommodate the literary understanding of women's lives. Such masculinized language that feminist theorists address is the use of, for example, \"God the Father\" which is looked upon as a way of designating the sacred as solely men (or, in other words, biblical language glorifies men through all of the masculine pronouns like \"he\" and \"him\" and addressing God as a \"He\"). Feminist theorists attempt to reclaim and redefine women through re-structuring language. For example, feminist theorists have used the term \"womyn\" instead of \"women\". Some feminist theorists find solace in changing titles of unisex jobs (for example, police officer versus policeman or mail carrier versus mailman). Some feminist theorists have reclaimed and redefined such words as \"dyke\" and \"bitch\" and others have invested redefining knowledge into feminist dictionaries.\n\nFeminist psychology is a form of psychology centered on societal structures and gender. Feminist psychology critiques the fact that historically psychological research has been done from a male perspective with the view that males are the norm. Feminist psychology is oriented on the values and principles of feminism. It incorporates gender and the ways women are affected by issues resulting from it. Ethel Dench Puffer Howes was one of the first women to enter the field of psychology. She was the Executive Secretary of the National College Equal Suffrage League in 1914.\n\nOne major psychological theory, \"relational-cultural theory\", is based on the work of Jean Baker Miller, whose book \"Toward a New Psychology of Women\" proposes that \"growth-fostering relationships are a central human necessity and that disconnections are the source of psychological problems\". Inspired by Betty Friedan's \"Feminine Mystique\", and other feminist classics from the 1960s, relational-cultural theory proposes that \"isolation is one of the most damaging human experiences and is best treated by reconnecting with other people\", and that a therapist should \"foster an atmosphere of empathy and acceptance for the patient, even at the cost of the therapist's neutrality\". The theory is based on clinical observations and sought to prove that \"there was nothing wrong with women, but rather with the way modern culture viewed them\".\n\nPsychoanalytic feminism and feminist psychoanalysis are based on Freud and his psychoanalytic theories, but they also supply an important critique of it. It maintains that gender is not biological but is based on the psycho-sexual development of the individual, but also that sexual difference and gender are different notions. Psychoanalytical feminists believe that gender inequality comes from early childhood experiences, which lead men to believe themselves to be masculine, and women to believe themselves feminine. It is further maintained that gender leads to a social system that is dominated by males, which in turn influences the individual psycho-sexual development. As a solution it was suggested by some to avoid the gender-specific structuring of the society coeducation. From the last 30 years of the 20th century, the contemporary French psychoanalytical theories concerning the feminine, that refer to sexual difference rather than to gender, with psychoanalysts like Julia Kristeva, Maud Mannoni, Luce Irigaray, and Bracha Ettinger, have largely influenced not only feminist theory but also the understanding of the subject in philosophy and the general field of psychoanalysis itself. These French psychoanalysts are mainly post-Lacanian. Other feminist psychoanalysts and feminist theorists whose contributions have enriched the field through an engagement with psychoanalysis are Jessica Benjamin, Jacqueline Rose, Ranjana Khanna, and Shoshana Felman.\nFeminist literary criticism is literary criticism informed by feminist theories or politics. Its history has been varied, from classic works of female authors such as George Eliot, Virginia Woolf, and Margaret Fuller to recent theoretical work in women's studies and gender studies by \"third-wave\" authors.\n\nIn the most general, feminist literary criticism before the 1970s was concerned with the politics of women's authorship and the representation of women's condition within literature. Since the arrival of more complex conceptions of gender and subjectivity, feminist literary criticism has taken a variety of new routes. It has considered gender in the terms of Freudian and Lacanian psychoanalysis, as part of the deconstruction of existing power relations.\n\nMany feminist film critics, such as Laura Mulvey, have pointed to the \"male gaze\" that predominates in classical Hollywood film making. Through the use of various film techniques, such as shot reverse shot, the viewers are led to align themselves with the point of view of a male protagonist. Notably, women function as objects of this gaze far more often than as proxies for the spectator. Feminist film theory of the last twenty years is heavily influenced by the general transformation in the field of aesthetics, including the new options of articulating the gaze, offered by psychoanalytical French feminism, like the matrixial gaze.\n\nLinda Nochlin and Griselda Pollock are prominent art historians writing on contemporary and modern artists and articulating Art history from a feminist perspective since the 1970s. Pollock works with French psychoanalysis, and in particular with Kristeva's and Ettinger's theories, to offer new insights into art history and contemporary art with special regard to questions of trauma and trans-generation memory in the works of women artists. Other prominent feminist art historians include: Norma Broude and Mary Garrard; Amelia Jones; Mieke Bal; Carol Duncan; Lynda Nead; Lisa Tickner; Tamar Garb; Hilary Robinson; Katy Deepwell.\n\nFeminist history refers to the re-reading and re-interpretation of history from a feminist perspective. It is not the same as the history of feminism, which outlines the origins and evolution of the feminist movement. It also differs from women's history, which focuses on the role of women in historical events. The goal of feminist history is to explore and illuminate the female viewpoint of history through rediscovery of female writers, artists, philosophers, etc., in order to recover and demonstrate the significance of women's voices and choices in the past.\n\nFeminist geography is often considered part of a broader postmodern approach to the subject which is not primarily concerned with the development of conceptual theory in itself but rather focuses on the real experiences of individuals and groups in their own localities, upon the geographies that they live in within their own communities. In addition to its analysis of the real world, it also critiques existing geographical and social studies, arguing that academic traditions are delineated by patriarchy, and that contemporary studies which do not confront the nature of previous work reinforce the male bias of academic study.\n\nThe Feminist philosophy refers to a philosophy approached from a feminist perspective. Feminist philosophy involves attempts to use methods of philosophy to further the cause of the feminist movements, it also tries to criticize and/or reevaluate the ideas of traditional philosophy from within a feminist view. This critique stems from the dichotomy Western philosophy has conjectured with the mind and body phenomena. There is no specific school for feminist philosophy like there has been in regard to other theories. This means that Feminist philosophers can be found in the analytic and continental traditions, and the different viewpoints taken on philosophical issues with those traditions. Feminist philosophers also have many different viewpoints taken on philosophical issues within those traditions. Feminist philosophers who are feminists can belong to many different varieties of feminism. The writings of Judith Butler, Rosi Braidotti, Donna Haraway, Bracha Ettinger and Avital Ronell are the most significant psychoanalytically informed influences on contemporary feminist philosophy.\n\nFeminist sexology is an offshoot of traditional studies of sexology that focuses on the intersectionality of sex and gender in relation to the sexual lives of women. Feminist sexology shares many principles with the wider field of sexology; in particular, it does not try to prescribe a certain path or \"normality\" for women's sexuality, but only observe and note the different and varied ways in which women express their sexuality. Looking at sexuality from a feminist point of view creates connections between the different aspects of a person's sexual life.\n\nFrom feminists' perspectives, sexology, which is the study of human sexuality and sexual relationship, relates to the intersectionality of gender, race and sexuality. Men have dominant power and control over women in the relationship, and women are expected to hide their true feeling about sexual behaviors. Women of color face even more sexual violence in the society. Some countries in Africa and Asia even practice female genital cutting, controlling women's sexual desire and limiting their sexual behavior. Moreover, Bunch, the women's and human rights activist, states that the society used to see lesbianism as a threat to male supremacy and to the political relationships between men and women. Therefore, in the past, people viewed being a lesbian as a sin and made it death penalty. Even today, many people still discriminate homosexuals. Many lesbians hide their sexuality and face even more sexual oppression.\n\nMonosexual Paradigm is a term coined by Blasingame, a self-identified African American, bisexual female. Blasingame used this term to address the lesbian and gay communities who turned a blind eye to the dichotomy that oppressed bisexuals from both heterosexual and homosexual communities. This oppression negatively affects the gay and lesbian communities more so than the heterosexual community due to its contradictory exclusiveness of bisexuals. \nBlasingame argued that in reality dichotomies are inaccurate to the representation of individuals because nothing is truly black or white, straight or gay. Her main argument is that biphobia is the central message of two roots; internalized heterosexism and racism. Internalized heterosexism is described in the monosexual paradigm in which the binary states that you are either straight or gay and nothing in between. Gays and lesbians accept this internalized heterosexism by morphing into the monosexial paradigm and favoring single attraction and opposing attraction for both sexes. Blasingame described this favoritism as an act of horizontal hostility, where oppressed groups fight amongst themselves. Racism is described in the monosexual paradigm as a dichotomy where individuals are either black or white, again nothing in between. The issue of racism comes into fruition in regards to the bisexuals coming out process, where risks of coming out vary on a basis of anticipated community reaction and also in regards to the norms among bisexual leadership, where class status and race factor predominately over sexual orientation. \n\nFeminist political theory is a recently emerging field in political science focusing on gender and feminist themes within the state, institutions and policies. It questions the \"modern political theory, dominated by universalistic liberalist thought, which claims indifference to gender or other identity differences and has therefore taken its time to open up to such concerns\".\n\nFeminist perspectives entered international relations in late 1980s, at about the same time as the end of the Cold War. This time was not a coincidence because the last forty years the conflict between US and USSR had been the dominant agenda of international politics. After the Cold War, there was continuing relative peace between the main powers. Soon, many new issues appeared on international relation's agenda. More attention was also paid to social movements. Indeed, in those times feminist approaches also used to depict the world politics. Feminists started to emphasize that while women have always been players in international system, their participation has frequently been associated with in non-governmental settings such as social movements. However, they could also participate in inter-state decision making process as men did. In fact, today, women also participate in iternational politics as the wives of diplomats, nannies who go abroad to find work and support their family, or sex workers trafficked across international boundaries. Women's contributions has not been seen in the areas where hard power plays significant role such as military. In contrast, women are profoundly impacted by decisions the statepersons make.\n\nFeminist economics broadly refers to a developing branch of economics that applies feminist insights and critiques to economics. Research under this heading is often interdisciplinary, critical, or heterodox. It encompasses debates about the relationship between feminism and economics on many levels: from applying mainstream economic methods to under-researched \"women's\" areas, to questioning how mainstream economics values the reproductive sector, to deeply philosophical critiques of economic epistemology and methodology.\n\nOne prominent issue that feminist economists investigate is how the gross domestic product (GDP) does not adequately measure unpaid labor predominantly performed by women, such as housework, childcare, and eldercare. Feminist economists have also challenged and exposed the rhetorical approach of mainstream economics. They have made critiques of many basic assumptions of mainstream economics, including the \"Homo economicus\" model. In the \"Houseworker's Handbook\" Betsy Warrior presents a cogent argument that the reproduction and domestic labor of women form the foundation of economic survival; although, unremunerated and not included in the GDP. According to Warrior: \"Economics, as it's presented today, lacks any basis in reality as it leaves out the very foundation of economic life. That foundation is built on women's labor; first her reproductive labor which produces every new laborer (and the first commodity, which is mother's milk and which nurtures every new \"consumer/laborer\"); secondly, women's labor composed of cleaning, cooking, negotiating social stability and nurturing, which prepares for market and maintains each laborer. This constitutes women's continuing industry enabling laborers to occupy every position in the work force. Without this fundamental labor and commodity there would be no economic activity.\" Warrior also notes that the unacknowledged income of men from illegal activities like arms, drugs and human trafficking, political graft, religious emoluments and various other undisclosed activities provide a rich revenue stream to men, which further invalidates GDP figures. Even in underground economies where women predominate numerically, like trafficking in humans, prostitution and domestic servitude, only a tiny fraction of the pimp's revenue filters down to the women and children he deploys. Usually the amount spent on them is merely for the maintenance of their lives and, in the case of those prostituted, some money may be spent on clothing and such accouterments as will make them more salable to the pimp's clients. For instance, focusing on just the U.S., according to a government sponsored report by the Urban Institute in 2014, \"A street prostitute in Dallas may make as little as $5 per sex act. But pimps can take in $33,000 a week in Atlanta, where the sex business brings in an estimated $290 million per year.\"\n\nProponents of this theory have been instrumental in creating alternative models, such as the capability approach and incorporating gender into the analysis of economic data to affect policy. Marilyn Power suggests that feminist economic methodology can be broken down into five categories.\n\nFeminist legal theory is based on the feminist view that law's treatment of women in relation to men has not been equal or fair. The goals of feminist legal theory, as defined by leading theorist Claire Dalton, consist of understanding and exploring the female experience, figuring out if law and institutions oppose females, and figuring out what changes can be committed to. This is to be accomplished through studying the connections between the law and gender as well as applying feminist analysis to concrete areas of law.\n\nFeminist legal theory stems from the inadequacy of the current structure to account for discrimination women face, especially discrimination based on multiple, intersecting identities. Kimberlé Crenshaw's work is central to feminist legal theory, particularly her article \"Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory, and Antiracist Politics\". \"DeGraffenreid v General Motors\" is an example of such a case. In this instance, the court ruled the plaintiffs, five Black women who were employees of General Motors, were not eligible to file a complaint on the grounds they, as black women, were not \"a special class to be protected from discrimination\". The ruling in \"DeGraffenreid\" against the plaintiff revealed the courts inability to understand intersectionality's role in discrimination. \"Moore v Hughes Helicopters, Inc.\" is another ruling, which serves to reify the persistent discrediting of intersectionality as a factor in discrimination. In the case of \"Moore\", the plaintiff brought forth statistical evidence revealing a disparity in promotions to upper-level and supervisory jobs between men and women and, to a lesser extent, between Black and white men. Ultimately, the court denied the plaintiff the ability to represent all Blacks and all females. The decision dwindled the pool of statistical information the plaintiff could pull from and limited the evidence only to that of Black women, which is a ruling in direct contradiction to \"DeGraffenreid\". Further, because the plaintiff originally claimed discrimination as a Black female rather than, more generally, as a female the court stated it had concerns whether the plaintiff could \"adequately represent white female employees\". \"Payne v Travenol\" serves as yet another example of the courts inconsistency when dealing with issues revolving around intersections of race and sex. The plaintiffs in \"Payne\", two Black females, filed suit against Travenol on behalf of both Black men and women on the grounds the pharmaceutical plant practiced racial discrimination. The court ruled the plaintiffs could not adequately represent Black males, however, they did allow the admittance of statistical evidence, which was inclusive of all Black employees. Despite the more favorable outcome after it was found there was extensive racial discrimination, the courts decided the benefits of the ruling – back pay and constructive seniority – would not be extended to Black males employed by the company. \"Moore\" contends Black women cannot adequately represent white women on issues of sex discrimination, \"Payne\" suggests Black women cannot adequately represent Black men on issues of race discrimination, and \"DeGraffenreid\" argues Black women are not a special class to be protected. The rulings, when connected, display a deep-rooted problem in regards to addressing discrimination within the legal system. While the cases of \"DeGraffenreid\" (1976), \"Moore\" (1983), and \"Payne\" (1976) are not recent accounts; they provide proof of the courts inconsistency in procedures and rulings on the basis of sex and race, which serves to reinforce the need for Feminist legal theory to not only be further developed, but also applied.\n\nFeminist communication theory has evolved over time and branches out in many directions. Early theories focused on the way that gender influenced communication and many argued that language was \"man made\". This view of communication promoted a \"deficiency model\" asserting that characteristics of speech associated with women were negative and that men \"set the standard for competent interpersonal communication\", which influences the type of language used by men and women. These early theories also suggested that ethnicity, cultural and economic backgrounds also needed to be addressed. They looked at how gender intersects with other identity constructs, such as class, race, and sexuality. Feminist theorists, especially those considered to be liberal feminists, began looking at issues of equality in education and employment. Other theorists addressed political oratory and public discourse. The recovery project brought to light many women orators who had been \"erased or ignored as significant contributors\". Feminist communication theorists also addressed how women were represented in the media and how the media \"communicated ideology about women, gender, and feminism\".\n\nFeminist communication theory also encompasses access to the public sphere, whose voices are heard in that sphere, and the ways in which the field of communication studies has limited what is regarded as essential to public discourse. The recognition of a full history of women orators overlooked and disregarded by the field has effectively become an undertaking of recovery, as it establishes and honors the existence of women in history and lauds the communication by these historically significant contributors. This recovery effort, begun by Andrea Lunsford, Professor of English and Director of the Program in Writing and Rhetoric at Stanford University and followed by other feminist communication theorists also names women such as Aspasia, Diotima, and Christine de Pisan, who were likely influential in rhetorical and communication traditions in classical and medieval times, but who have been negated as serious contributors to the traditions.\n\nFeminist communication theorists are also concerned with a recovery effort in attempting to explain the methods used by those with power to prohibit women like Maria W. Stewart, Sarah Moore Grimké, and Angelina Grimké, and more recently, Ella Baker and Anita Hill, from achieving a voice in political discourse and consequently being driven from the public sphere. Theorists in this vein are also interested in the unique and significant techniques of communication employed by these women and others like them to surmount some of the oppression they experienced.\n\nFeminist theorist also evaluate communication expectations for students and women in the work place, in particular how the performance of feminine versus masculine styles of communicating are constructed. Judith Butler, who coined the term \"gender performativity\" further suggests that, \"theories of communication must explain the ways individuals negotiate, resist, and transcend their identities in a highly gendered society\". This focus also includes the ways women are constrained or \"disciplined\" in the discipline of communication in itself, in terms of biases in research styles and the \"silencing\" of feminist scholarship and theory.\n\nWho is responsible for deciding what is considered important public discourse is also put into question by feminist theorists in communication scholarship. This lens of feminist communication theory is labeled as revalorist theory which honors the historical perspective of women in communication in an attempt to recover voices that have been historically neglected. There have been many attempts to explain the lack of representative voices in the public sphere for women including, the notion that, \"the public sphere is built on essentialist principles that prevent women from being seen as legitimate communicators in that sphere\", and theories of subalternity\", which, \"under extreme conditions of oppression...prevent those in positions of power from even hearing their communicative attempts\".\n\nTechnical writers have concluded that visual language can convey facts and ideas clearer than almost any other means of communication. According to the feminist theory, \"gender may be a factor in how human beings represent reality.\"\n\nMen and women will construct different types of structures about the self, and, consequently, their thought processes may diverge in content and form. This division depends on the self-concept, which is an \"important regulator of thoughts, feelings and actions\" that \"governs one's perception of reality\".\n\nWith that being said, the self-concept has a significant effect on how men and women represent reality in different ways.\n\nRecently, \"technical communicators' terms such as 'visual rhetoric,' 'visual language,' and 'document design' indicate a new awareness of the importance of visual design\".\n\nDeborah S. Bosley explores this new concept of the \"feminist theory of design\" by conducting a study on a collection of undergraduate males and females who were asked to illustrate a visual, on paper, given to them in a text. Based on this study, she creates a \"feminist theory of design\" and connects it to technical communicators.\n\nIn the results of the study, males used more angular illustrations, such as squares, rectangles and arrows, which are interpreted as a \"direction\" moving away from or a moving toward, thus suggesting more aggressive positions than rounded shapes, showing masculinity.\n\nFemales, on the other hand, used more curved visuals, such as circles, rounded containers and bending pipes. Bosley takes into account that feminist theory offers insight into the relationship between females and circles or rounded objects. According to Bosley, studies of women and leadership indicate a preference for nonhierarchical work patterns (preferring a communication \"web\" rather than a communication \"ladder\"). Bosley explains that circles and other rounded shapes, which women chose to draw, are nonhierarchical and often used to represent inclusive, communal relationships, confirming her results that women's visual designs do have an effect on their means of communications.\n\nBased on these conclusions, this \"feminist theory of design\" can go on to say that gender does play a role in how humans represent reality.\n\nBlack feminist criminology theory is a concept created by Hillary Potter in the 1990s and a bridge that integrates Feminist theory with criminology. It is based on the integration of Black feminist theory and critical race theory.\n\nFor years, Black women were historically overlooked and disregarded in the study of crime and criminology; however, with a new focus on Black feminism that sparked in the 1980s, Black feminists began to contextualize their unique experiences and examine why the general status of Black women in the criminal justice system was lacking in female specific approaches. Potter explains that because Black women usually have \"limited access to adequate education and employment as consequences of racism, sexism, and classism\", they are often disadvantaged. This disadvantage materializes into \"poor responses by social service professionals and crime-processing agents to Black women's interpersonal victimization\". Most crime studies focused on White males/females and Black males. Any results or conclusions targeted to Black males were usually assumed to be the same situation for Black females. This was very problematic since Black males and Black females differ in what they experience. For instance, economic deprivation, status equality between the sexes, distinctive socialization patterns, racism, and sexism should all be taken into account between Black males and Black females. The two will experience all of these factors differently; therefore, it was crucial to resolve this dilemma.\n\nBlack feminist criminology is the solution to this problem. It takes four factors into account: One, it observes the social structural oppression of Black women. Two, it recognizes the Black community and its culture. Three, it looks at Black intimate and familial relations. And four, it looks at the Black woman as an individual. These four factors will help distinguish Black women from Black males into an accurate branch of learning in the criminal justice system.\n\nIt has been said that Black feminist criminology is still in its \"infancy stage\"; therefore, there is little discussion or studies that disprove it as an effective feminist perspective. In addition to its age, Black feminist criminology has not actively accounted for the role of religion and spirituality in Black women's \"experience with abuse\".\n\nFeminist science and technology studies (STS) refers to the transdisciplinary field of research on the ways gender and other markers of identity intersect with technology, science, and culture. The practice emerged from feminist critique on the masculine-coded uses of technology in the fields of natural, medical, and technical sciences, and its entanglement in gender and identity. A large part of feminist technoscience theory explains science and technologies to be linked and should be held accountable for the social and cultural developments resulting from both fields.\n\nSome key issues feminist technoscience studies address include:\n\n\n\n"}

She is the head of the executive.\n\n\n\nThe Assembly sets departmental policy. The General Council has 31\nConseillers généraux for the 31 Cantons of the Pyrénées-Orientales and its Chairman.\nThe Conseiller général is the representative, elected by universal suffrage for 6 years.\n\nThe General Councils exercise the powers given by the laws of decentralization in the social welfare, the roads and water network, education, fire and rescue services, economic development, public museums, departmental archives, and the management of protected areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe General Council has a policy of cooperation with the Generalitat of Catalonia, the Province of Girona and the Andorra to create a Catalan Eurodistrict.\n\nJuly 27, 2007 in Céret took place the signature of the framework agreement for launching the Eurodistrict project\nEstablishment of a Common Fund to support projects of cooperation across the Catalan space, and common development of cross-border projects, the General Council and the Casa de la Generalitat de Catalunya in Perpignan.\n\nA study in 1997 found that 55% of the population understand, 39% can read and 34% can speak Catalan. It found a higher percantage of speakers in villages and lower in the capital city. Although Catalan has no official status it was first recognised in 1951 when it was introduced into the school curriculum. The Region of Languedoc-Roussillon created an agency for the promotion of the two regional languages, Catalan and Occitan.\n\nAt the session of 10 December 2007, the General Council approved the \"Charter for Catalan\" in which the Pyrénées-Orientales is committed to ensure the promotion, development and dissemination of the Catalan language and the Catalan culture.\nIt says in the Preamble: \"Catalan, is born more than a thousand years, is one of the pillars of our identity, heritage and richness of the department of Pyrénées-Orientales (Northern Catalonia).\nThe term Northern Catalonia gets its first official recognition.\n\nThe Pyrénées-Orientales is conducting a pilot study of installation of automatic defibrillators. On April 2, 2007, the General Council first decided to purchase defibrillators for 22 municipalities located more than 20 minutes from emergency medical services. Since March 2008, when a defibrillator was installed in Mosset, 141 municipalities have them, the objective being to equip all 226 municipalities and the 22 General Council buildings. Certain municipalities have also decided to install additional defibrillators at highly frequented locations.\n\nAfter a presentation to the French Council of Mayors, other French departments and regions are also considering the installation of automatic defibrillators.\n\nThe devices require a telephone line and an ADSL connection, and their ground support equipment makes use of GPS. Thus their installation also helps to reduce the digital divide in formerly poorly connected villages.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "50040737", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50040737", "title": "Insects in literature", "text": "Insects in literature\n\nInsects have appeared in literature from classical times to the present day, an aspect of their role in culture more generally. Insects represent both positive qualities like cooperation and hard work, and negative ones like greed.\n\nAmong the positive qualities, ants and bees represent industry and cooperation from the Book of Proverbs and Aesop's fables to tales by Beatrix Potter. Insects including the dragonfly have symbolised harmony with nature, while the butterfly has represented happiness in springtime in Japanese Haiku, as well as the soul of a person who has died.\n\nInsects have equally been used for their strangeness and alien qualities, with giant wasps and intelligent ants threatening human society in science fiction stories. Locusts have represented greed, and more literally plague and destruction, while the fly has been used to indicate death and decay, and the grasshopper has indicated improvidence. The horsefly has been used from classical times to portray torment, appearing in a play by Aeschylus and again in Shakespeare's \"King Lear\" and \"Antony and Cleopatra\"; the mosquito has a similar reputation.\n\nInsects play important roles in around one hundred novels and a hundred short stories in English literature. They are used to portray both positive and negative qualities, more usually negative, including entrapment, stinging, being rapacious, and swarming. They are common in fantasy and especially in science fiction, often as the earthly or alien villains. Detective novels sometimes use insects as unexpected murder weapons. A fly on the wall is used as a voyeur to tell erotic stories in R. Chopping's \"The Fly\", and the anonymous \"Autobiography of a Flea\". Franz Kafka made use of the strangeness of insect metamorphosis in his novella \"The Metamorphosis\" (), as have several authors since.\n\nAnthropomorphised ants have often been used in fables, children's stories, and religious texts to represent industriousness and cooperative effort. In the Book of Proverbs, ants are held up as a good example for humans for their hard work and cooperation. Aesop did the same in his fable \"The Ant and the Grasshopper\". Some modern authors have used ants to comment on the relationship between society and the individual, as with Robert Frost in his poem \"Departmental\" and T. H. White in his fantasy novel \"The Once and Future King\".\n\nBeatrix Potter's illustrated 1910 children's book \"The Tale of Mrs Tittlemouse\" features the busy bumblebee Babbity Bumble and her brood.\n\nThe poet W. B. Yeats wrote \"The Lake Isle of Innisfree\" (1888) with the honey bee couplet \"Nine bean rows will I have there, a hive for the honey bee, / And live alone in the bee loud glade\", while he was living in Bedford Park, London.\n\nLafcadio Hearn wrote in his 1901 book \"A Japanese Miscellany\" that Japanese poets had created dragonfly \"haiku\" \"almost as numerous as are the dragonflies themselves in the early autumn.\" The poet Matsuo Bashō (1644–1694) wrote \"haiku\" such as \"Crimson pepper pod / add two pairs of wings, and look / darting dragonfly\", relating the autumn season to the dragonfly. Hori Bakusui (1718–1783) similarly wrote \"Dyed he is with the / Colour of autumnal days, / O red dragonfly.\"\n\nThe poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson described a dragonfly splitting its old skin and emerging shining metallic blue like \"sapphire mail\" in his 1842 poem \"The Two Voices\", with the lines \"An inner impulse rent the veil / Of his old husk: from head to tail / Came out clear plates of sapphire mail.\"\n\nThe novelist H. E. Bates described the rapid, agile flight of dragonflies in his 1937 nonfiction book \"Down the River\":\n\nIn the traditional Navajo religion, Big Fly is an important spirit being.\n\nLafcadio Hearn's essay \"Butterflies\" analyses the treatment of the butterfly in Japanese literature, both prose and poetry. He notes that these often allude to Chinese tales, such as of the young woman that the butterflies took to be a flower. Among the brief 17-syllable Japanese Haiku poems about butterflies, of which he translates 22, one by the Haiku master Matsuo Bashō is said to suggest happiness in springtime: \"Wake up! Wake up!—I will make thee my comrade, thou sleeping butterfly.\" Another compares the butterfly's shape to a Japanese silk upper-dress, the \"haori\", \"being taken off\". A third says they look to be girls of \"about seventeen or eighteen years old.\" Hearn retells, too, the old story of a man who dies after 50 years alone, having mourned his sweetheart Akiko daily all that time. As he dies, \"a very large white butterfly entered the room, and perched upon the sick man's pillow.\" The man smiles in death. \"Then it must have been Akiko!\", says an old woman who knew him.\n\nInsects have repeatedly been used in literature as strange or alien beings. Sir John Tenniel drew a famous illustration of Alice meeting a caterpillar for Lewis Carroll's \"Alice in Wonderland\", c. 1865. The caterpillar is seated on a toadstool and is smoking a hookah pipe; the image can be read as showing either the forelegs of the larva, or as suggesting a face with protruding nose and chin. H.G. Wells wrote about intelligent ants destroying human settlements in Brazil and threatening human civilization in his 1905 science-fiction short story, \"The Empire of the Ants.\" He made use of giant wasps in his 1904 novel \"The Food of the Gods and How It Came to Earth\":\n\nIn 1917 the ghost story author Algernon Blackwood wrote \"An Egyptian Hornet\", about a beast at once alarming and beautiful: \"From a distance he examined this intrusion of the devil. It was calm and very still. It was wonderfully made, both before and behind. Its wings were folded upon its terrible body. Long, sinuous things, pointed like temptation, barbed as well, stuck out of it. There was poison, and yet grace, in its exquisite presentment.\" The story contrasts the reactions to the threat of the churchman, the Reverend James Milligan, and the \"depraved\" Mr. Mullins.\n\nThe science fiction writer Eric Frank Russell's 1957 \"Wasp\" has its protagonist, James Mowry, as a \"wasp\" terrorist, a small but deadly Terran (human) force in the Sirian Empire's midst.\n\nDevouring plagues of locusts are mentioned in literature throughout history. The Ancient Egyptians carved locusts on tombs in the period 2470 to 2220 BC, and a devastating plague is mentioned in the Book of Exodus in the Bible, as taking place in Egypt around 1300 BC. Plagues of locusts are also mentioned in the Quran.\n\nEric Carle's children's book \"The Very Hungry Caterpillar\" portrays the larva as an extraordinarily hungry animal.\n\n\"The Impertinent Insect\" is a group of five fables, sometimes ascribed to Aesop, concerning an insect which may be a fly, gnat, or flea, and which puffs itself up to seem important.\n\nIn the Biblical fourth plague of Egypt, flies represent death and decay. Myiagros was a god in Greek mythology who chased away flies during the sacrifices to Zeus and Athena; Zeus sent a fly to bite Pegasus, causing Bellerophon to fall back to Earth when he attempted to ride the winged steed to Mount Olympus.\n\nEmily Dickinson's 1855 poem \"I Heard a Fly Buzz When I Died\" refers to flies in the context of death. In William Golding's 1954 novel \"Lord of the Flies\", the fly is a symbol of the children involved.\n\nOne of Aesop's Fables, the tale of \"The Ant and the Grasshopper\". The ant works hard all summer, while the grasshopper plays. In winter, the ant is ready but the improvident grasshopper starves. Somerset Maugham's short story \"The Ant and the Grasshopper\" explores the fable's symbolism via complex framing.\n\nOther human weaknesses besides improvidence have become identified with the grasshopper's behaviour. So an unfaithful woman (hopping from man to man) is \"a grasshopper\" (), an 1892 short story by Anton Chekhov, and in the films called \"The Grasshopper\" by Samson Samsonov (1955) and Jerry Paris (1970) based on that story.\n\nThe Ancient Greek playwright Aeschylus has a gadfly pursue and torment Io, a maiden associated with the moon, watched constantly by the eyes of the herdsman Argus, associated with all the stars: \"Io: Ah! Hah! Again the prick, the stab of gadfly-sting! O earth, earth, hide, the hollow shape—Argus—that evil thing—the hundred-eyed.\" William Shakespeare, inspired by Aeschylus, has Tom o'Bedlam in \"King Lear\", \"Whom the foul fiend hath led through fire and through flame, through ford and whirlpool, o'er bog and quagmire\", driven mad by the constant pursuit. In \"Antony and Cleopatra\", Shakespeare likens Cleopatra's hasty departure from the Actium battlefield to that of a cow chased by a gadfly: \"The breeze [gadfly] upon her, like a cow in June / hoists sail and flies\", where \"June\" may allude not only to the month but also to the goddess Juno who torments Io; and the cow in turn may allude to Io, who is changed into a cow in Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\".\n\nThe physician and naturalist Thomas Muffet wrote that the horse-fly \"carries before him a very hard, stiff, and well-compacted sting, with which he strikes through the Oxe his hide; he is in fashion like a great Fly, and forces the beasts for fear of him only to stand up to the belly in water, or else to betake themselves to wood sides, cool shades, and places where the wind blowes through.\" The \"Blue Tail Fly\" in the eponymous song was probably the mourning horsefly (\"Tabanus atratus\"), a tabanid with a blue-black abdomen common to the southeastern United States.\n\nMosquitoes have been part of oral lore, and even of told jokes, and from folklore pronouncing the origin of the mosquito, and depicting its relation to a \"blood-sucking monster\" contemporary work has been written and illustrated. The Tlingit legend \"How Mosquitoes Came to Be\" expresses the never-ending torment inflicted by the mosquito.\n\n"}
{"id": "2596183", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2596183", "title": "Keling", "text": "Keling\n\nKeling () or Kling is a word used in parts of Southeast Asia to denote a person of South Asian origin, especially from India but to a lesser extent Pakistan and Bangladesh. This includes both those from India and overseas Indians. In modern colloquial usage it is commonly not capitalised. The term is used in the Malay Archipelago — specifically Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and Brunei — but cognates exist in neighbouring countries as well. Although the early definition was neutral and linked to the historical Kalinga kingdom of Eastern India, its use in later history came to be perceived as a derogatory term to refer to people of Indian descent, especially in Malaysia.\n\nThe word \"Keling\" derives from the ancient Indian kingdom of Kalinga. While this was apparently sometimes localized as \"Kalingga\" (as in the Indonesian Kalingga Kingdom), the terminal schwa sound was dropped in common usage to form Keling. Though ostensibly denoting the Kalinga kingdom, the term Keling in ancient Southeast Asia came to be a more general term for India and its people. The Khmer word Kleng (ក្លិង្គ) and the Thai word \"Khaek\" (แขก) derived from the same root. Prior to the introduction of the English word \"India\", Keling and Jambu Dwipa were used to refer to the country in the Malay and Indonesian language, while \"Benua Keling\" referred to the Indian Subcontinent.\n\nThe earliest known occurrence of the word \"Keling\" appears in the in \"Sejarah Melayu\" (Malay Annals). The legend mentions Raja Shulan as the king of Keling who sets out to conquer China with his descendant Raja Chulan. Scholars identify Raja Chulan with the Chola king of India, from whom the term \"Chulia\" derives, as in Penang's Chulia Street. Later parts of the Sejarah Melayu mention the voyages of Hang Nadim and Hang Tuah to \"Benua Keling\" (India). However Keling must not be misunderstood as a specific territory, rather it refers to people of Indian origin and not only the inhabitants of Kalinga. For example, a colonial-era Indonesian tradition refers to the Ramayana epic as \"Rama Keling\" meaning \"Rama the Indian\". After the introduction of Islam, Keling sometimes referred specifically to Tamils or Telugu people while Gujaratis and Indo-Aryan peoples from Pakistan were often confused with \"Parsi\" or Persians.\n\nThe Dutch used the words \"Clings\" and \"Klingers\" to refer to the Indian inhabitants of Malacca. The British colonial writings also use the word \"Kling\" to describe the immigrants from Madras Presidency and Coromandel coast. John Crawfurd (1856) mentioned that the term \"Kling\" was used by the Malays and the Javanese as \"a general term for all the people of Hindustan (North India), and for the country India itself\".\n\nThe 16th-century Portuguese traveller Castanheda wrote of the Keling community in Melaka in the period between 1528-1538:\n\nIn its early usage Keling was a neutral term for people of Indian origin, but was perceived negatively beginning in the 20th century due to various socio-political factors. From the mid-1900s, words denoting ethnic origin were used derogatively in Malay to imply immigrant status. Consequently more neutral language was chosen for political correctness. This can be observed in the 1960 publication \"Cherita Jenaka\" in which the term \"orang Keling\" (Keling people) was changed to \"orang India\" (Indian people) in 1963.\n\nThe word \"Keling\" has been used variously within the Malay community to mean Indian, Tamil, or south Indian. The title \"Kapitan Keling\" was used for a representative of an Indian community, similar to the \"Kapitan Cina\" of a Chinese community. In early Penang of the 1790s the \"Kapitan Keling\" was Cauder Mohideen who, together with the Kapitan Cina Koh Lay Huan and other prominent members of the community, formed the first Committee of Assessors to decide the rates and collection of taxes. This usage is preserved is the name of the Kapitan Keling Mosque, a prominent Penang landmark.\n\nIn many modern cases \"Keling\" is used as a derogatory term. It was used in 2005 by Members of Parliament in Malaysia because of misconception about Indian ethnics, which resulted in an uproar accusing the MPs of racism.\n\nTraditionally in Java, Indonesia, Keling is linked with India while Kalingga refers to the 6th century Kalingga Kingdom, which ultimately derived from the Indian Kalinga kingdom. It can possibly have other meanings, such as \"ship\". Rivets used to connect metals are called \"paku keling\" or \"blunt nail\". in modern colloquial Indonesian, it is sometimes used to refer to any dark-skinned person, a stereotype of southern Indians, though this usage is considered offensive.\n\nIn Cambodia, the slang term for Indian people is \"Kleng\" (ក្លិង្គ), also derived from the kingdom of Kalinga and cognate with the Malay Keling or Kling. It may also be used as a nickname for people who have stereotypically Indian features such as big eyes and dark skin.\n\nThe equivalent of Keling in the Thai language is \"Khaek\" (แขก). It is a generic term referring to any South Asians, particularly those from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. The term generally has no negative connotation and is used even in polite or formal communication. However, outside influence and confusion with Mughals and Indian Muslims has broadened the meaning in modern times to include certain predominantly Muslims communities, particularly Persians and Arabs. This extended meaning is considered inaccurate and at times rejected as derogatory, especially by Thai Muslims, but has become increasingly widespread.\n\nThe phrases \"Keling-a\" (Hokkien; 吉寧仔; POJ: \"Kiet-lêng-á\"), \"Keling-yan\" (Cantonese; 吉寧人; Yale: \"gat-lìhng-yan\"), and \"Keling-kia\" (Teochew) are frequently used within the Chinese community in Malaysia and Singapore. As with the Malay word these were not originally offensive today may be used in either a derogatory or non-derogatory manner: e.g., in Penang Hokkien, which is spoken by some Indians in Penang, \"Keling-a\" is the only word that exists to refer to ethnic Indians.\n\nThe Hokkien and Teochew suffixes \"-a\" and \"-kia\" are diminutives that are generally used to refer to non-Chinese ethnic groups, while \"-yan\" mean human.\n\nVarious place names in Malaysia contain the word Keling for historical reasons, e.g. Tanjong Keling., Kampong Keling, and Bukit Keling, etc.\n\nIn Penang, the Kapitan Keling Mosque, situated on the corner of Buckingham Street and Jalan Masjid Kapitan Keling (Pitt Street), is one of the oldest mosques in George Town. Various other Penang Hokkien street names contain the word \"Keling\", e.g. Kiet-leng-a Ban-san (Chowrasta Road), Kiet-leng-a Ke (King Street/Market Street).\n\nIn Singapore, there is a road in Jurong Industrial Estate called Tanjong Kling Road which is probably derived from the word 'Keling'.\n\nIn Jepara Regency, Central Java, Indonesia, there is a subdistrict called Keling. Locals link the location with the 6th century Kalingga Kingdom. In Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia, there is a place called Pacar Keling meaning \"Keling lover\".\n\n"}

If a gate is found open, it should be left open, and if it is closed, it should be left closed. If a closed gate absolutely must be traversed, it should be closed again afterwards. It applies to visitors travelling onto or across farms, ranches, and stations.\n\nIn low-rainfall areas, closing gates can cut livestock off from water supplies. For example, most of the land used for grazing in Australia has no natural water supplies, so drinking water for the stock must be supplied by the farmer or landowner, often by using a windmill to pump groundwater. Even visitors who know how a stock water system works may be unaware of breakdowns. During hot weather, cattle require large quantities of water to drink and can die in less than a day if they don't get it. Sheep need less water and can survive longer without it, but will die if cut off from water for several hot days.\n\nIn all agricultural areas, farmers need to keep groups of livestock separate, for reasons including breeding for disease resistance and increased production, pest control, and controlling when ewes deliver their lambs. Unwanted mingling of flocks or herds can deprive a farmer of significant income.\n\nThe original versions of the United Kingdom's Country Code advised visitors to always close gates. The revised Countryside Code now suggests that gates should be left as found.\n\n"}

{"id": "185564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=185564", "title": "Man with a Movie Camera", "text": "Man with a Movie Camera\n\nMan with a Movie Camera () is an experimental 1929 Soviet silent documentary film, directed by Dziga Vertov and edited by his wife Elizaveta Svilova.\n\nVertov's feature film, produced by the film studio VUFKU, presents urban life in the Soviet cities of Kiev, Kharkov, Moscow and Odessa. It has no actors. From dawn to dusk Soviet citizens are shown at work and at play, and interacting with the machinery of modern life. To the extent that it can be said to have \"characters,\" they are the cameramen of the title, the film editor, and the modern Soviet Union they discover and present in the film.\n\n\"Man with a Movie Camera\" is famous for the range of cinematic techniques Vertov invented, deployed or developed, such as multiple exposure, fast motion, slow motion, freeze frames, match cuts, jump cuts, split screens, Dutch angles, extreme close-ups, tracking shots, reversed footage, stop motion animations and self-reflexive visuals (at one point it features a split-screen tracking shot; the sides have opposite Dutch angles).\n\n\"Man with a Movie Camera\" was largely dismissed upon its initial release; the work's quick-cut editing, self-reflexivity, and emphasis on form over content were all subjects of criticism. In the British Film Institute's 2012 \"Sight & Sound\" poll, however, film critics voted it the eighth greatest film ever made, and the work was later named the best documentary of all time in the same magazine.\n\nThe film has an unabashedly avant-garde style, and emphasizes that film can go \"anywhere\". For instance, the film uses such scenes as superimposing a shot of a cameraman setting up his camera atop a second, mountainous camera, superimposing a cameraman inside a beer glass, filming a woman getting out of bed and getting dressed, even filming a woman giving birth, and the baby being taken away to be bathed.\n\nVertov's message about the prevalence and unobtrusiveness of filming was not yet true – cameras might have been able to go anywhere, but not without being noticed; they were too large to be hidden easily, and too noisy to remain hidden anyway. To get footage using a hidden camera, Vertov and his brother Mikhail Kaufman (the film's co-author) had to distract the subject with something else even louder than the camera filming them.\n\nThe film also features a few obvious stagings such as the scene of a woman getting out of bed and getting dressed and the shot of chess pieces being swept to the center of the board (a shot spliced in backwards so the pieces expand outward and stand in position). The film was criticized for both the stagings and the stark experimentation, possibly as a result of its director's frequent assailing of fiction film as a new \"opiate of the masses\".\n\nVertov – born David Abelevich Kaufman – was an early pioneer in documentary film-making during the late 1920s. He belonged to a movement of filmmakers known as the kinoks, or kino-oki (kino-eyes). Vertov, along with other kino artists declared it their mission to abolish all non-documentary styles of film-making. This radical approach to movie making led to a slight dismantling of film industry: the very field in which they were working. Most of Vertov's films were highly controversial, and the kinok movement was despised by many filmmakers of the time. Vertov's crowning achievement, \"Man with a Movie Camera\", was his response to critics who rejected his previous film, \"A Sixth Part of the World\". Critics had declared that Vertov's overuse of \"intertitles\" was inconsistent with the film-making style to which the 'kinoks' subscribed.\n\nWorking within that context, Vertov dealt with much fear in anticipation of the film's release. He requested a warning to be printed in the Soviet central Communist newspaper, \"Pravda\", which spoke directly of the film's experimental, controversial nature. Vertov was worried that the film would be either destroyed or ignored by the public. Upon the official release of \"Man with a Movie Camera\", Vertov issued a statement at the beginning of the film, which read:\n\n\"The film \"Man with a Movie Camera\" represents\nAN EXPERIMENTATION IN THE CINEMATIC COMMUNICATION\nOf visual phenomena\nWITHOUT THE USE OF INTERTITLES\nWITHOUT THE HELP OF A SCENARIO\nWITHOUT THE HELP OF THEATRE\nThis new experimentation work by Kino-Eye is directed towards the creation of an authentically international absolute language of cinema on the basis of its complete separation from the language of theatre and literature.\"\n\nThis manifesto echoes an earlier one that Vertov wrote in 1922, in which he disavowed popular films he felt were indebted to literature and theater.\n\nWorking within a Marxist ideology, Vertov strove to create a futuristic city that would serve as a commentary on existing ideals in the Soviet world. This artificial city’s purpose was to awaken the Soviet citizen through truth and to ultimately bring about understanding and action. The kino’s aesthetic shined through in his portrayal of electrification, industrialization, and the achievements of workers through hard labour. This could also be viewed as early modernism in film.\n\nSome have mistakenly stated that many visual ideas, such as the quick editing, the close-ups of machinery, the store window displays, even the shots of a typewriter keyboard are borrowed from Walter Ruttmann's \"\" (1927), which predates \"Man with a Movie Camera\" by two years, but as Vertov wrote to the German press in 1929, these techniques and images had been developed and employed by him in his Kino-Pravda newsreels and documentaries for the last ten years, all of which predate \"Berlin\". Vertov's pioneering cinematic concepts actually inspired other abstract films by Ruttmann and others, including writer, translator, filmmaker and critic Liu Na'ou (1905–1940) whose \"The Man Who Has a Camera \" (1933), pays explicit homage to Vertov's \"The Man With a Movie Camera\".\n\nOn a technical note, \"Man with a Movie Camera\"'s usage of double exposure and seemingly 'hidden' cameras made the movie come across as a very surreal montage rather than a linear motion picture. Many of the scenes in the film contain people, which change size or appear underneath other objects (double exposure). Because of these aspects, the movie is fast-moving. The sequences and close-ups capture emotional qualities, which could not be fully portrayed through the use of words. The film's lack of 'actors' and 'sets' makes for a unique view of the everyday world; one that, according to a title card, is directed toward the creation of a new cinematic language that is \"[separated] from the language of theatre and literature.\"\n\n\"Man with a Movie Camera\", depicting the daily life of a Soviet city, was actually filmed over a period of about 3 years. Four Soviet cities – Kharkiv, Kiev, Moscow and Odessa – were the shooting locations.\n\n\"Man with a Movie Camera\" was not always a highly regarded work. Vertov's Soviet contemporaries criticized its focus on form over content, with Sergei Eisenstein even deriding the film as \"pointless camera hooliganism\". The work was largely dismissed in the West as well. Documentary filmmaker Paul Rotha said that in Britain, Vertov was \"regarded really as rather a joke, you know. All this cutting, and one camera photographing another camera – it was all trickery, and we didn't take it seriously.\" The pace of the film's editing – more than four times faster than a typical 1929 feature, with approximately 1,775 separate shots – also perturbed some viewers, including \"The New York Times\"' reviewer Mordaunt Hall:\n\nBecause of doubts before screening, and great anticipation from Vertov's pre-screening statements, the film gained great interest before even being shown. Once the film was finally screened, the public either embraced or dismissed Vertov's stylistic choices.\n\n\"Man with a Movie Camera\" is now regarded by many as one of the greatest films ever made, having ranked eighth in the 2012 \"Sight & Sound\" poll of the world's best films. In 2009, Roger Ebert wrote, \"It made explicit and poetic the astonishing gift the cinema made possible, of arranging what we see, ordering it, imposing a rhythm and language on it, and transcending it.\"\n\n\"Man with a Movie Camera\" has been interpreted as an optimistic work. Jonathan Romney has called it \"an exuberant manifesto that celebrates the infinite possibilities of what cinema can be.\" Peter Bradshaw of \"The Guardian\" wrote that the work \"is visibly excited about the new medium’s possibility, dense with ideas, packed with energy: it echoes \"Un Chien Andalou\", anticipates Vigo's \"À propos de Nice\" and the New Wave generally, and even Riefenstahl's \"Olympia\".\"\n\nThe film, originally released in 1929, was silent, and accompanied in theaters with live music. It has since been released a number of times with different soundtracks:\n\n\n\n"}

It is currently associated with the works of Ágnes Heller, Victor Grauer and Carlos Escudé and it is strongly rooted in the criticisms which Habermas has leveled at postmodern philosophy, namely that universalism and critical thinking are the two essential elements of human rights and that human rights create a superiority of some cultures over others. That is, that equality and relativism are \"mutually contradictory\".\n\nSoon after the modern movement, reactions were formed based in the philosophies of Friedrich Nietzsche and Søren Kierkegaard. The reaction took on the name of existentialism, and was characterized by the phrase \"existence precedes essence\". Existentialism was followed by postmodernism, which embraced Nietzsche's critique of the will to truth, which is the standing characteristic of modernism. Neomodernists maintain that truth still exists in a universal form and directly refute existentialist and postmodern viewpoints that the essence of an existent is formed in the observer's bias. Neomodernists stand against the discrediting of the concept of authorial intent in postmodern hermeneutics. Instead, they state that a text written in simple terms can only have the meaning that the author intended, rather than finding that even the most straightforward text can have multiple interpretations.\n\nÁgnes Heller's work is associated with Moral Anthropology and \"probing modernity's destiny for a non-predatory humanism that combines the existential wisdom of ancient theory with modern values.\"\n\nNeomodernism accepts some aspects of postmodernism's critique of modernism, notably that modernism elevated the world view of dominant groups to the status of objective fact, thereby failing to express the viewpoint of \"subaltern groups,\" such as women and ethnic minorities. However, in her view, neomodernism rejects postmodernism as:\n\n\nIn 1982, Victor Grauer attacked \"the cult of the new,\" and proposed that there had arisen a \"neo-modern\" movement in the arts which was based on deep formal rigor, rather than on \"the explosion of pluralism.\" His argument was that post-modernism was exclusively a negative attack on modernism, and had no future separate from modernism proper, a point of view which is held by many scholars of modernism.\n\nIn \"Natural Law at War\", a review essay published on 31 May 2002 in \"The Times Literary Supplement\" (London, TLS No. 5174), Carlos Escudé wrote: “Postmodern humanity faces a major challenge. It must solve a dilemma it does not want to face. If all cultures are morally equivalent, then all human individuals are not endowed with the same human rights, because some cultures award some men more rights than are allotted to other men and women. If, on the other hand, all men and women are endowed with the same human rights, then all cultures are not morally equivalent, because cultures that acknowledge that ‘all men are created equal’ are to be regarded as ‘superior,’ or ‘more advanced’ in terms of their civil ethics than those that do not.” Escudé's brand of neomodernism contends with “politically-correct intellectuals who prefer to opt for the easy way out, asserting both that we all have the same human rights and that all cultures are equal.”\n\nPublished their own Neomodernist Manifesto in 2001. The Neomodern Manifesto posits criteria for a revitalised approach to works of art founded on history, traditional artistic disciplines, theology and philosophy. Durand's and Alemdar's Neomodernism views art as an act of expression of the sublime; in Neomodern painting as a representation of the visual appearance of things with correspondence to the physical world understood as a model for beauty, truth, and good. Neomodern works of art via mimesis interpret and present the universe and man’s existence, in line with the belief that the reality we live is but a mirror of another universe that can only be accessed through inspiration and imagination.\n\nGabriel Lolu Omowaye, in his speech 'A new challenging time' to a group of college students in Nigeria, in 2005, took a different approach to neomodernism. He viewed neomodernism as a political philosophy that became more prominent in the early 21st century. To him, it involves common goal and joint global effort - universalism - to address arising global challenges such as population growth, natural resources, climate change and environmental factors, natural causes and effects, and health issues. Omowaye posited that political will is the major driver of economic necessities. As a result, he added that neomodernism involves limited government-regulated liberalism along with high drive innovation and entrepreneurship, high literacy rate, progressive taxation for social equity, philanthropism, technological advancement, economic development and individual growth. He perceived the quest for equal representation of men and women in the neomodern era as a strong signal for advent of postmodernism. So also, the quest for youths engagement in resourceful and rewarding ways especially in governance, peace building and self-productivity has not taken a formidable shape than it is at this time. As far as he was concerned, he believed most of these challenges were not adequately tackled in preceding eras and the arising challenges thus stated were not prepared for and that cause for change in mentality and thinking which the neomodern era is providing for solutions to the era's challenges, with a prospective view to global stability and social inclusion. His philosophical thought premised on a fact that new times require new approaches from new reasonings, even if some applicable ideas or methologies could be borrowed from the past, an acute form of paradigm-shift.\n\nOmowaye believed in idealism as guiding realism and in turn, realism as defining idealism. Moral concepts cannot be wished away from social norms, but evolving social trends dissipate morality in form of religion and logical standards and adheres to current norms in form of 'what should be'. Consequently, the manner at which 'what should be' is driven at in the modern and postmodern eras, being widely accepted became 'what is'. The manner at which the damage of the new 'what is' is hampering development process in the form of higher mortality rate and decadence of cultural good, calls to question the ideology behind the norms that are less beneficial to a wider society in form of globalization. The world as a whole through technological advancement became a global community particularly, in the 21st century. Former Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan then stated that the \"suffering anywhere concerns people everywhere\". Champions of neomodern age such as Bill Gates and Richard Branson in the field of philanthropy expounded their vision to encompass the global community in social good such as alleviating poverty, eradicating diseases, enhancing literacy rates and addressing climate changes.\n\nTechnological advancement of the neomodern era however has its downturns in that it added to the decadence in cultural good such that people everywhere, especially high number of youths follow the trends in the new 'what is', which include social celebrities in the form of dressing, sexual activities, extravagancies, and less interest in learning and even, working but more interest in making money. Money became a value-determinant than utility. This brought about frauds in various sectors. This latter aspect is not limited to youths but even company executives, and politicians of many societies. Technological advancement has made privacy less safer for intrusion and people more safer for protection. The supposedly good of technological advancement in the neomodern era has included whistle blow such as Wikileaks' Julian Assange. The more good has been in the level of innovations and innovators it has sprung up such as Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and easier business models and broader social connectivity. This latter part has lessened more amity in immediate environment and many people tend to live more in the virtual world neomodern technological advancements have created.\n\nNeomodernism checks more into the current relative way of living of people and the society to correct necessary abnormalities and to encourage virtues and values within the global community in the 21st century.\n\nIn furtherance, Gabriel Omowaye's view of neomodernism was that knowledge comes from learning and experience, and wisdom primarily from intuition. Knowledge is a variable of set occurrences of that which happens to a man and that which a man seeks to know. Knowledge is vital and good for discretion but a minor part of discernment wherein what is known might not be applicable. Intuition is a function of the mind and the mind, not seen, and yet unknown to the carrier, is a function of what put the thoughts, ideas and discretion in it. Wisdom without knowledge is vague, and knowledge without wisdom, unworthy. Wisdom perfects knowledge, and in the absence of either, the sole is delusory.\n\nNeomodernism has been cited in law as applying to an approach which grants economic rights to indigenous peoples, but without restricting them to their traditional economic activities. Neomodernism recognizes the importance of the human side of organizations. People and their needs are put at the center and, with the recognition that the values and beliefs of people both shape and are shaped by their experiences of organizational life, comes an interest in areas such as organizational culture, leadership and management.

It is a satirical piece of eighteenth-century colonial literature written in New Spain (modern day Mexico), which sought to offer an alternative view of life in colonial Spanish America.\n\nThe Baratillo was an infamous market in Mexico City known for the sale of used items, many of which had been stolen and were cheaply priced. It was a place for the poor and lower class of Mexico, usually racially mixed people, to mingle and purchase items for subsistence.\n\nOrdenanzas, or official decrees, were established to regulate New Spanish society in general. The author’s 377 ordenanzas mimicked the official statutes, but would completely reverse the power system based on the sistema de castas. In effect, Chreslos Jache mocks the limpieza de sangre by creating a separate system of classification for Spaniards. For example, “medio Españoles” (half-Spanish) and “cuartilla de Español” (one-quarter Spanish) were parodies of terms to identify persons of mixed race, like “mestizo”, “castiza”, “lobo”, and countless others.\n\nThe purpose of this manuscript was to show a chaotic view of life in Mexico in which the castas used a variety of strategies to substantiate their control over society and that the casta system itself is self-regulating. Chreslos Jache pokes fun at this idea of self-regulation by making up ridiculous names that are impossible to adequately translate for the terminology of the sistema de castas. The manuscript states that the sistema de castas was also mocked by the formation of the Baratillo “brotherhood” which was composed exclusively of non-whites, mainly mulattos. This brotherhood banned membership to Spaniards and their descendants, and instead made them targets of the brotherhood’s scams. By using the Baratillo brotherhood, Chreslos Jache inverts the traditional racial attitude of the time where Spaniards and creoles dominated the system.\n\nThe manuscript reinforced race as a category of power differentiation within New Spain because it was a text that circulated among the educated elite in a time when primarily upper class people were literate. The significance of this satirical manuscript in relation to Casta paintings is that, much like the manuscript, the paintings reflect racial debate and also contribute to the interpretation of racial culture during the second half of the eighteenth-century in New Spain.\n"}

In stanzas of five lines of eight syllables each, the standard elements of epic poetry are interwoven with a colourful, dramatic theme. \n\nThe uninterrupted recitation or \"Pabasa\" of the whole epic is a popular Filipino Catholic devotion during the Lenten season, and particularly during Holy Week.\n\nIn 2011, the performing art was cited by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts as one of the intangible cultural heritage of the Philippines under the performing arts category that the government may nominate in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.\n\nThe text is an adaptation of the pre-Hispanic Filipino art of chanting epic poems as a part of oral tradition. After Christianity was introduced by the Spaniards, the Passion cycle was adapted into this native narrative form. \n\nThe indigenous form of the \"Pasyón\" was first written down by Gaspar Aquino de Belén in \"Ang Mahal na Pasión ni Jesu Christong Panginoon Natin na Tola\" (\"The Sacred Passion of Jesus Christ Our Lord that is a Poem\"), written in 1703 and approved in 1704.\n\nAn 1852 erudition by Aniceto de Merced, \"El libro de la vida\" (\"The Book of the Life [of Jesus]\") did not prove popular with the masses.\n\nThe most popular Tagalog version of the \"Pasyón\" is the \"Casaysayan nang Pasiong Mahal ni Jesucristong Panginoon Natin na Sucat Ipag-alab nang Puso nang Sinomang Babasa\" (\"The Story of the Passion of Jesus Christ, Our Lord, which Rightly Shall Ignite the Heart of Whosoever Readeth\"). \n\nThis version is also known as the \"Pasyóng Genesís\" as the Genesis creation narrative precedes the sections concerning the Virgin Mary and Christ. Another name for the text is \"Pasyóng Pilapil\", after the foreword by a certain Dr Mariano Pilapil found in the 1814 printing. The book's title page describes it as being commissioned by former Archbishop of Manila José Seguí, O.S.A., and former Augustinian provincial Manuel Grijalvo, O.S.A., with corrections to the Latin phrases done by a certain Fr Amador W. Cruz. \n\nA widely circulated version of the \"Pasyóng Genesís\" is the 1949 printing by Ignacio Luna and Sons, Co. The edition's title begins with \"Awit at Salaysay...\" (\"Song and Narrative\") instead of \"\n≠aysayan\".\n\nThe \"Pasyón\" is normally heard during Holy Week in the Philippines, where its recitation is known as the \"Pabása\" (\"Reading\"). The rite can span several days, extending no later than Black Saturday, but it is often ended on Good Friday at noon or before 15:00 PHT (GMT+8) – the traditional hour of Jesus' death on the cross. \n\nReaders chant the \"Pasyón\" from beginning to end without pause; this non-stop recitation is facilitated by devotees chanting in shifts. The chanters usually perform the rite as a \"panatà\" (\"vow\"), or votive offering in request or thanksgiving. Devotees are frequently older women and some men, but in recent years younger Filipinos have shown an increased interest in the custom. \n\nThe \"Pasyón\" is almost always chanted while facing an altar with religious icons, particularly those related to the suffering and death of Christ. Temporary altars are often erected within the home or inside an outdoor booth decorated with palm leaves. The \"Pabasa\" may also be performed at a local \"visita\"/\"kapilya\" (chapel of ease) or some other communal area.\n\nAs per Filipino etiquette, the host of the \"Pabasa\" (often the master or mistress of the house) is responsible for feeding the shifts of chanters as well as other guests.\n\nThere are various traditional settings or \"tono\" for the \"Pasyón\" that have been passed down through the centuries. Recent innovations include setting the epic to modern ballads, pop music, and contemporary hymns, in some places a rap or hip hop variant is used. Instrumental accompaniment to the \"Pabasa\" is not uniform in practise; the guitar and keyboard are commonly employed.\n\n"}

The following text is taken from \"English fairy and other folk tales\", 1906, which in turn refers to the \"Diary of Abraham dela Pryme\", 1699:\n\nThe Pedlar of Swaffham\nTradition says that there lived in former times in Soffham (Swaffham), alias Sopham, in Norfolk, a certain pedlar, who dreamed that if he went to London Bridge, and stood there, he should hear very joyfull news, which he at first slighted, but afterwards, his dream being doubled \nand trebled upon him, he resolved to try the issue of it, and accordingly went to London, and stood on the bridge there two or three days, looking about him, but heard nothing that might yield him any comfort. \n<br>\n<br>At last it happened that a shopkeeper there, hard by, having noted his fruitless standing, seeing that he neither sold any wares nor asked any almes, went to him and most earnestly begged to know what he wanted there, or what his business was; to which the pedlar honestly answered that he had dreamed that if he came to London and stood there upon the bridge he should hear good newse; at which the shop-keeper laught heartily, asking him if he was such a fool as to take a journey on such a silly errand, adding: \"I'll tell thee, country fellow, last night I dreamed that I was at Sopham, in Norfolk, a place utterly unknown to me, where methought behind a pedlar's house in a certain orchard, and under a great oak tree, if I dug I should find a vast treasure!

Therefore, good fellow, learn wit from me, and get you home, and mind your business.\" \n<br>\n<br>The pedlar observing his words, what he had say'd he dream'd, and knowing they concentred in him, glad of such joyfull newse, went speedily home, and digged and found a prodigious great treasure, with which he grew exceeding rich ; and Soffham (Church) being for the most part fallen down, he set on workmen and rectified it most sumptuously, at his own charges ; and to this day there is his statue therein, but in stone, with his pack at his back and his dogg at his heels ; and his memory is also preserved by the same form or picture in most of the old glass windows, taverns, and alehouses of that town unto this day.\n\nSimilar legends can be found throughout Europe and the Middle-East. The earliest version is one of the poems of the Mathanawi titled \"In Baghdad, Dreaming of Cairo: In Cairo, Dreaming of Baghdad\", by 13th century Persian poet Jalal al-Din Rumi. This poem was turned into a story in the tale from The One Thousand and One Nights: \"The man who became rich through a dream\"; and spread through various countries' folklore, children's tales and literature. More recently, the story was adapted into the plot of the novel \"The Alchemist\" by Paulo Coelho.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22597719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22597719", "title": "Proto-Berber language", "text": "Proto-Berber language\n\nProto-Berber is the reconstructed proto-language from which the modern Berber languages stem. Proto-Berber was an Afroasiatic language, and as such, its descendant Berber languages are cousins to the Egyptian language, Cushitic languages, Semitic languages, Chadic languages, and the Omotic languages.\n\nProto-Berber shows features that clearly distinguish it from all other branches of Afroasiatic, but modern Berber languages are relatively homogeneous. Whereas the split from the other known Afroasiatic branches was very ancient, on the order of 10,000~9,000 years ago, according to glottochronological studies, Proto-Berber might be as recent as 3,000 years ago. Louali & Philippson (2003) propose, on the basis of the lexical reconstruction of livestock-herding, a Proto-Berber 1 (PB1) stage around 7,000 years ago and a Proto-Berber 2 (PB2) stage as the direct ancestor of contemporary Berber languages.\n\nIn the third millennium BC, proto-Berber speakers spread across the area from Morocco to Egypt. In the last millennium BC, another Berber expansion created the Berber peoples noted in Roman records. The final spread occurred in the first millennium BC, when the Tuareg, now possessing camels, moved into the central Sahara; in the past, the northern parts of the Sahara were much more inhabitable than they are now.\n\nThe fact that there are reconstructions for all major species of domestic ruminant except for the camel in Proto-Berber implies that its speakers produced livestock and were pastoralists.\n\nAnother dating system is based on examining the differences that characterize ancient stages of Semitic and Egyptian in the third millennium BC. Many researchers have estimated the differences to have taken 4,000 years to evolve, resulting in breaking this language family in six distinct groups (Semitic, Egyptian, Berber, Cushitic, Chadic and Omotic) in the eighth millennium BC. Proto-Afroasiatic is thus from the tenth millennium since it took at least 2,000 years before it reached the stage where these different branches of this language family evolved.\n\nFrom that perspective, Proto-Berber was the first Berber stage to depart from Proto-Afrosiatic in the eighth millennium. It was restructured several times during the almost 10,000 years that separated it from its modern shape, which has preserved few relics.\n\nRoger Blench (2018) suggests that Proto-Berber speakers experienced intense language leveling about 2,000 years ago as the Roman Empire was expanding in North Africa. Hence, although Berber had split off from Afroasiatic several thousand years ago, Proto-Berber itself can only be reconstructed to a period as late as 200 A.D. Blench (2018) notes that Berber is considerably different from other Afroasiatic branches, but modern-day Berber languages displays low internal diversity. The presence of Punic borrowings in Proto-Berber points to the diversification of modern Berber language varieties subsequent to the fall of Carthage in 146 B.C.; only Zenaga lacks Punic loanwords. Additionally, Latin loanwords in Proto-Berber point to the breakup of Proto-Berber between 0-200 A.D. During this time period, Roman innovations including the ox-plough, camel, and orchard management were adopted by Berber communities along the \"limes\", or borders of the Roman Empire. This resulted in a new trading culture involving the use of a lingua franca which became Proto-Berber.\n\nReconstructions of the ancient stages of this language are based on comparisons with other Afro-Asiatic languages in various stages and on the comparisons between the varieties of modern Berber languages or with Touareg, considered by some authors like Prasse to be the variety that best preserved proto-Berber. Some authors have criticised the reconstructed Proto-Berber phonological systems as being too close to those of modern Berber varieties because the common elements derived from the comparisons project modern phonology onto the Proto-Berber stage.\n\nSome earlier attempts to derive the phonemic inventory of Proto-Berber were heavily influenced by Tuareg because of its perception of being particularly archaic.\n\nKarl G. Prasse and Maarten Kossmann reconstruct three short vowels /a/, /i/, /u/ and four long vowels /aa/, /ii/, /uu/ and /ee/. Their main reflexes in modern Berber languages are shown in the following table:\n\nTuareg and Ghadames also have /o/, which seems to have evolved from /u/ by vowel harmony in Tuareg and from *aʔ in Ghadames.\nThe influence of the Semitic vocalic system (three short vowels /i/, /u/, /a/ and three corresponding long vowels (/i:/, /u:/, /a:/) is evident in the proposed reconstruction model.\n\nAllati has reconstructed a Proto-Berber vocalic system made of six vowels: i, u, e, o, a \nWithout the long vowels that are not Proto-Afroasiatic (cf. Diakonoff, 1965 : 31, 40 ; Bomhard et Kerns, 1994 : 107, among others) and that evolved in some modern Berber varieties (Toureg, Ghadames, ...), the system is preserved in the southeastern Berber varieties including Tuareg. It is equally close to the proposed Proto-Afroasiatic vocalic system (Diakonoff, 1965, 1988).\n\nAlexander Militarev reconstructs the vowels /a/, /i/, /u/ in his proto-forms.\n\nKossmann reconstructs the following consonantal phonemes for Proto-Berber:\n\nAs in modern Berber languages, most Proto-Berber consonants had a homorganic tense counterpart, with some exceptions such as w~gːʷ, ɣ~qː.\n\nThe consonants *ɟ and *g have remained distinct in some Zenati languages:\n\nSimilarly, Proto-Berber *c, corresponding to \"k\" in non-Zenati varieties, became \"š\" in Zenati (but a number of irregular correspondences for this are found). For example, \"căm\" \"you (f. sg.)\" becomes \"šəm\". (The change also occurs in Nafusi and Siwi.)\n\nEastern Berber languages:\n\nProto-Berber *\"-əβ\" has become \"-i\" in Zenati. For example, *\"arəβ\" \"write\" becomes \"ari\". (This change also occurs in varieties including the Central Atlas Tamazight dialect of the Izayan, Nafusi, and Siwi.)\n\nGhadamès and Awjila are the only Berber languages to preserve Proto-Berber *β as β; elsewhere in Berber it becomes \"h\" or disappears.\n\nThe Proto-Berber consonantal system reconstructed by Allati (cf. Allati, 2002, 2011) is based on remains from the ancient stages of this language preserved in the ancient toponymical stratas, in Libyan inscriptions and in the modern Berber varieties. It had stops b, t, d, k, g; fricative s; nasal n and liquids l, r. The stops of the phonological system have evolved since the proto-Berber stage into variants from which other consonants have been progressively formed (Allati, 2002, 2011).\n\nKarl G. Prasse has produced a comprehensive reconstruction of Proto-Berber morphology based on Tuareg. Additional work on the reconstruction of Proto-Berber morphology was done by Maarten Kossmann.\n\nProto-Berber had no grammatical case. Its descendants developed a marked nominative that is still present in Northern Berber and Southern Berber/Tuareg. In some cases, Proto-Berber lost it thereafter, recently in Eastern Berber and Western Berber (Zenaga).\n\nThe relics of the ancient morphological segments preserved in the modern varieties, in the Libyan inscriptions and in the ancient toponymical stratas show that the basis of word formation is a monosyllabic lexical unit (vc, cvc) whose vowels and consonants are part of the root.\n\nIts forms and its characteristics are similar to those of the base of word formation postulated for proto-Afroasiatic. The composition and the reduplication/doubling process whose traces are preserved in all the Afroasiatic branches, including Semitic where they are fossilized in the quadrilaterals and quintiliterals, constitute the type of word formation at that stage of Berber.\n\nThese remains also show that agglutination is the Proto-Berber mode of the grammatical adjunction of morphemes whose placement was not fixed in relation to the elements that they determine (cf. Allati, 2002, 2011b/c, 2012, 2013, 2014). The relations between the predicate of existence, the core of the utterance in the proto-Berber stage, and its determinants ordered around it without a pre-established order, are indicated with affixes (cf. idem).\n\nThe Proto-Berber relics preserved at the lexico-semantic and syntactic levels show that the proto-Berber syntactic construction is of the ergative type (cf. idem). The proto-Berber statement core is a predicate of existence, a lexical base which posits the existence of a fact, of a situation…i.e. it expresses a state, a quality (cf. Allati, 2002, 2011b/c, 2013 below) having the value of a stative (cf. idem et Allati, 2008). It is not oriented in relation to its determinants (agentive subject, object…) whose syntactic functions are insured by casual elements including the casual affix (ergative) that indicates, as needed, the agent or the subject. Similar elements attested in Cushitic, Chadic and Omotic, and remains preserved in Semitic drove Diakonoff to postulate the same type of syntactic construction for proto-Semitic et proto-Afroasiatic (cf. Diakonoff, 1988, 101 ; cf. equally Allati, 2008, 2011a, 2012).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2527137", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2527137", "title": "Religious education in primary and secondary education", "text": "Religious education in primary and secondary education\n\nReligious education is the term given to education concerned with religion. It may refer to education provided by a church or religious organization, for instruction in doctrine and faith, or for education in various aspects of religion, but without explicitly religious or moral aims, e.g. in a school or college. The term is often known as religious studies.\n\nReligious Education (RE) is a compulsory subject in the state education system in England. Schools are required to teach a programme of religious studies according to local and national guidelines.\n\nReligious Education in England is mandated by the Education Act 1944 as amended by the Education Reform Act 1988 and the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. The provision of Religious Education is compulsory in all state-funded schools, but it is not compulsory for any of the children to take the subject. The subject consists of the study of different religions, religious leaders, and other religious and moral themes. However, the curriculum is required to reflect the predominant place of Christianity in religious life and hence Christianity forms the majority of the content of the subject. All parents have the right to withdraw a child from religious education, which schools must approve.\n\nAdditionally, all schools are required by law to provide a daily act of collective worship, of which at least 51% must be Christian in basis over the course of the academic year. Sarah Smalley, the chair of the Association of Religious Education inspectors, advisors and consultants, stated that some \"schools did have problems fulfilling the requirement for worship\" due to what they thought was \"a lack of space to gather the entire school for worship\" although Smalley noted that \"there is actually no requirement for such a gathering, as smaller groups are allowed.\" The National Union of Teachers suggested in 2008 that parents should have a right to have specific schooling in their own faith and that imams, rabbis and priests should be invited to offer religious instruction to pupils in all state schools.\n\nEngland has a Local Agreed Syllabus which mandate subject teaching for each Key Stage and possibly for each school year. The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority has also produced the non-statutory National Framework for Religious Education, which provides guidelines for the provision of RE at all key stages, and models the eight-levels as applied in National Curriculum subjects.\n\nIn France, RE is replaced by a non-religious moral teaching (called civic, legal and social education : \"éducation civique, juridique et sociale\", ECJS). Children can additionally receive, on a voluntary basis, a religious education, either at school in private religious school, or outside of school, in their religious community, if they are in a public (State) school. Although in some rare regions, namely Alsace-Moselle, the old Concordat of 1801 being still valid because of the German occupation at the time of the separation of Church and State in France and the strong stand of population in favour of this, religious education is compulsory, and a dispense is necessary if the child refuses to be following (Catholic or Protestant) religious education.\n\nIn Ireland religion is taught in a subject called Religious Education which is compulsory in many schools for the Junior Certificate, but available as an option for the Leaving Certificate. The course educates students about communities of faith, the foundations of the major world religions, the sacred texts, religious practices and festivals for Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists and Christians. Students also learn about religious change in Ireland, meaning in life, religious and non-religious responses to the search for meaning, atheism, agnosticism and other forms of belief. Students are also educated about morality in a number of different faiths and their moral codes.\n\nIsraeli school system includes State Schools; Religious State Schools; Recognized Schools and Exempt Schools, whose students are regarded as fulfilling the obligatory education.\n\nThe prevailing view is that the religious education would contravene the constitutional separation of state and religion. In place of RE, there is a short but nonetheless compulsory subject called in primary school, where the purpose is to teach moral values rather than to teach ethics as an academic subject. However, despite the stated secular stance, references to the majority religions of Shinto and Buddhism are sometimes made in class texts.\n\nBeing a secular country, with no state religion, Lebanon is expected to have a neutral position regarding religious education in its schools, which is not the case in the country, as well as many European and American countries. Lebanon doesn't have a law concerning RE in its educational establishments. Schools have the right to either give RE classes, or do the opposite. Religious classes are not obligatory, nor banned, and they are not replaced by \"ethics\" classes.\nPrivate Schools (Christian and Muslim) give mandatory religious classes, reflecting their religious identification. Students from other religions don't take any classes during the religious ones, but they always can sign up for the RE class. Catholic schools give only Catholic classes, mandatory for Christian students, but can be signed up for by Muslim students, if not, Muslims do not take any classes in parallel to Christian ones. Public schools kind of have a more liberal religious program. A Lebanese public school may give, or not give RE classes, which regard the predominant religion of the population in the area the school is located in. Students have to take these classes, whether they are Christian or Muslim. A public school located in a mixed area would prefer not to give RE classes, unless voted oppositely by locals, RE classes may be both Christian and Muslim at the same time in this case, and students divide when this happens.\n\nThe Malaysian education system makes \"Moral Studies\" compulsory for non-Muslim students at secondary and primary schools. Muslim students instead partake in \"Islamic Studies\" lessons. Both subjects figure among the seven compulsory subjects undertaken by students for the Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia. There has been considerable debate about the usefulness of the \"Moral\" subject, primarily due to the strict exam-oriented marking-schemes.\n\n Article 2 of the Constitution of Norway mandates Evangelical-Lutheran parents to provide a religious upbringing for their children. With the revision of the Constitution in 2012, this mandate was removed. In the education system, religious education is found in a subject now labeled KRLE (Christianity, religion and ethical education). A minimum of 50% of the subject should be on Christianity, yet preaching has been disapproved since 1969. \n\nIn Scottish state schools, Religious Education is called \"Religious and Moral Education\" from ages 5 to 14, and \"Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies\" from 14 to 18.\n\nThe majority of state schools in are non-denominational, but as a result of the Education Act 1918, separate denominational state schools were also established. The vast majority of denominational state schools are Roman Catholic but there are also a number of Scottish Episcopal schools. The school buildings are built and maintained by the Roman Catholic Church were handed over to the state under the Education Act. Since then,the Catholic schools are fully funded by the Scottish Government and administered by the Education and Lifelong Learning Directorate. As part of the deal, there are specific legal provisions to ensure the promotion of a Catholic ethos in such schools: applicants for positions in the areas of Religious Education, Guidance or Senior Management must be approved by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland, which also appoints a chaplain to each of its schools. There is also one Jewish state primary school.\n\nThe South African National Policy on Religion and Education adopted in September 2003 provides for Religion Education, i.e. education about diverse religions, which does not promote any particular religion in the public school curriculum. The policy does not apply to private schools.\n\nThe majority of middle eastern countries provide compulsory religious studies in both private and public schools. The religious studies in private schools can be based on the religious beliefs of the student and can be complied with by the school.\n\n"}

In present-day Rennes-le-Château an academic under instructions from Magnus Martel is seen with the relic—the Loculus—researching on the ground to find the right place to hide it. Magnus's son Jake, an ace cryptographer, is released from Wormwood Scrubs and recruited by his father for research on the Loculus. Magnus reveals that the Loculus relates to the Knights Templar and its sinister successor organisation known as \"the order\", and in secret receives calls from this organisation threatening him if he does not accelerate his research—in spite of this, Magnus realises the Loculus' massive power for good or evil and has hidden it to ensure it does not fall into the order's hands. After breaking a code on the Loculus to reveal the word \"palingenesis\", Jake hides whilst members of the organisation kill and flay his father. Jake then flees with another researcher on the project (the occultist Mira) and seeks help from the Roman Catholic priest Father Ray Connolly. \n\nThe trail takes the three characters to (among others) a Cambridge library to research Isaac Newton's involvement in attempting to unlock the Loculus and to Rennes-le-Château and its Tour Magdala. They discover that the Loculus is related to Christian eschatology and has been hidden on Patmos, writing-place of the \"Book of Revelation\". Father Connolly stays behind in London as back-up while Mira and Jake go to Patmos and find the Loculus hidden in a crypt beneath a Greek Orthodox Church and former temple to Mary Magdalene as Aphrodite. Using the reflective properties of a hermaphrodite symbol on the Loculus they reveal a hexagram built into the floor, an occult symbol. Jake and Mira disrobe and make love within the symbol in an attempt to unlock it, experiencing a vision of themselves as Christ and Mary Magdalene before fleeing into the crypt when they hear a pursuer approaching. \n\nThe pursuer turns out to in fact be Father Connolly and together they finally work out the Loculus's meaning—its significance in fact lies in the four nails holding it together, which are those used to crucify Christ and retain organic matter with his DNA, preserved in a ceremony on Mount Hebron. The Templars and the order have continually attempted to use the DNA on it to resurrect Christ (including one failed attempt by Newton), but have failed until the genetic advances of the present day. The three argue as to what to do with the discovery—Jake concurs with his dead father and wishes to destroy it to keep it out of the order's hands, whilst Ray wishes to take it to a trustworthy African cardinal at the Vatican. Ray prevails and traps the other two, but on arrival in Rome the order's Grand Master seizes the Loculus, puts Ray under torture and sends troops to kill Mira and Jake. The couple manage to flood the chambers with sand to kill the troops and the church's monks are alerted to the couple's plight by an emergency postcard sent by Connolly before his departure, but only Mira manages to escape—Jake is fatally buried. In the meantime the Grand Master has cloned Christ and had him not only proclaimed the Messiah by the Vatican but put under his own tutelage and control, so that he can brutalize him and rule the world through him. The film closes with Mira realising that she (Magdalene's descendant) has given birth to a child by a Martel (Christ's descendant via the Merovingian dynasty) and that she must keep him secret from the order (as predicted by ) so as to oppose the Grand Master's puppet Christ.\n\nMuch of the film is shot on location, including on Malta.\n\nNominated for \"Best Film\" (2001) in the Sitges – Catalan International Film Festival.\n\nOverall reception was hostile. \"The Guardian\", for example, noted the film's \"rag-bag of extraordinary cameos\" but criticised the \"vulgar heresies\" on which it was based and likened the \"significant, ritual sex with a beautiful alchemist\" with the \"clean-limbed young hero\" to an Occult-based sketch in \"Not the Nine O'Clock News\". \"The Observer\" wrote of the film as \"ludicrous\", a \"farrago\", \"straight-faced\" and \"the fag end of a millennial cycle of apocalyptic pictures\".\n\n"}

It grants its owner the power to become invisible at will. Through the story of the ring, \"Republic\" considers whether an intelligent person would be moral if they did not have to fear being caught and punished for doing injustices.\n\nGyges of Lydia was a historical king, the founder of the Mermnad dynasty of Lydian kings. Various ancient works—the most well-known being \"The Histories\" of Herodotus—gave different accounts of the circumstances of his rise to power. All, however, agree in asserting that he was originally a subordinate of King Candaules of Lydia, that he killed Candaules and seized the throne, and that he had either seduced Candaules' Queen before killing him, married her afterwards, or both.\n\nIn Glaucon's recounting of the myth, an unnamed ancestor of Gyges was a shepherd in the service of the ruler of Lydia. After an earthquake, a cave was revealed in a mountainside where he was feeding his flock. Entering the cave, he discovered that it was in fact a tomb with a bronze horse containing a corpse, larger than that of a man, who wore a golden ring, which he pocketed. He discovered that the ring gave him the power to become invisible by adjusting it. He then arranged to be chosen as one of the messengers who reported to the king as to the status of the flocks. Arriving at the palace, he used his new power of invisibility to seduce the queen, and with her help he murdered the king, and became king of Lydia himself.\n\nIn \"Republic\", the tale of the ring of Gyges is described by the character of Glaucon who is the brother of Plato. Glaucon asks whether any man can be so virtuous that he could resist the temptation of being able to perform any act without being known or discovered. Glaucon suggests that morality is only a social construction, the source of which is the desire to maintain one's reputation for virtue and justice. Hence, if that sanction were removed, one's moral character would evaporate.\n\nGlaucon posits:\n\nThough his answer to Glaucon's challenge is delayed, Socrates ultimately argues that justice does not derive from this social construct: the man who abused the power of the Ring of Gyges has in fact enslaved himself to his appetites, while the man who chose not to use it remains rationally in control of himself and is therefore happy.

{"id": "41153992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41153992", "title": "Russian cultural property law", "text": "Russian cultural property law\n\nAfter the Second World War in 1945, issues surrounding wartime loss and compensation started to arise. Cultural valuables were taken from Germany and placed in the Soviet Union. Years later, at the break up of the USSR, the said cultural valuables came to attention as the issue of ownership arose. Following, the debates between the Russian Duma and the Yeltsin government began, with the Duma focusing on compensation to Russia for wartime loss, and Yeltsin focusing on maintaining international relationships and agreements. Arising from the debate, were many struggles, but ultimately the enactment of the Federal Law on Cultural Valuables Displaced to the USSR as a Result of the Second World War and Located on the Territory of the Russian Federation.\n\nAt the end of the Second World War in 1945, in what some would argue as retaliation, and others as compensation for the massive loss of cultural property the Soviet Union suffered, cultural valuables (such as books, art, artifacts, etc.) were taken (stolen, or relocated) from Germany. Since the end of the War the existence of such valuables were kept secret, and their existence was denied. In total during World War II, nearly thirty million Soviet people died as a result of prison camps, torture, starvation and cold blood murder. The USSR suffered a huge wartime loss, not only through cultural property but also by the deaths of millions of people. In 1991 when the collapse of the Soviet Union occurred, and the rise of the Russian Federation began, mention of vast amounts of hidden cultural valuables came to light because the issue of ownership arose.\n\nIn June 1992, a Decree of the Russian Government created what was called the State Commission for Restitution of Cultural Valuables, which was to decide issues related to restitution. However, the Commission did very little and was at a halt by June 1993, and then was later abolished by March 2001. \nAlso, in 1992, there were many bilateral cultural agreements with a number of countries such as, Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Luxembourg, Poland, and the United Kingdom for mutual restitution of displaced cultural valuables; none of which were talked about in the Constitutional Court ruling in 1999 about the constitutionality of the Russian 1998 law, where international agreements were to be put above domestic laws. \nHowever, in June 1992 there was the only restitution of books to the west by Russia; there was 600 Dutch books that were returned to the Netherlands. But, this is only a small portion of the estimated 30,000 Dutch books that had arrived in the USSR. The idea of restitution did not last long, and soon turned into demands for compensation.\n\nStarting in 1994, the idea of restitution had completely come to a stop, and the debates started about constructing a law on said cultural valuables. Duma deputies are responsible for the start of the debate by stating that there is lack of international laws and the inadequacy of domestic legislation to justify its refusal to permit further restitution. This came about when Duma deputies refused the return of French archives that were a part of a 1992 agreement. \nDemands for compensation from wartime loss and destruction started to arise from the Duma deputies, suggesting that other countries should be charged storage fees for what was held in Russia secretly for over 50 years; and further that the only possible restitution of cultural valuables that would occur to other nations was in exchange for Russian cultural valuables, because the deputies at this point were arguing that many of the plundered cultural valuables from Russia were being held across the ocean from the United States Zone of Occupation in Germany. Further, with the support of some legal specialists and Russian legislators argue that all the cultural valuables that were brought to Moscow under government orders were all done so legally. But, nevertheless there is the other side of the debate, which is also supported by the Yeltsin government, who argue for compromise and internationally appropriate solutions.\n\nFor six years the debate continued. In January 1995 a large international conference was held in New York City titled \"Spoils of War\", where the international context about the issues surrounding cultural valuables plundered or misplaced at the end of the Second World War came to light. Firstly, it was important to note that no allied agreement that was made ever stated that works of art or other cultural property could be used for compensation purposes. Efforts such as what was done by the British and the Americans, where they carried out an elaborate program of restitution to countries of origin were discussed. Stories such as the United States had returned over half a million cultural items to the Soviet Union, but Russians were not aware of this, were among many topics discussed. \nOn an international level, legal concepts and precedents existed during the time of the plundering from Germany in 1945, such as the Hague Convention of 1907. Specifically Article 56 of the Convention \"forbids the seizure, damaging and destruction of property of educational and art institutions, … and articles of scientific and artistic value belonging to individuals and societies as well as to the State\". Such international law did not stop Stalin from ordering the seizure of cultural valuables as compensatory reparations from Germany. However, Stalin's order is still followed by the Russian position 50 years later, as they would argue that these transfers (seizures) were carried out legally after the war as compensation. On the other side such a point of view is wrong because Russia is not in compliance with international law regarding the protection of cultural property. \nDespite the ongoing debate and Russia's failure to restitute cultural valuables to other European countries, Russia had an interest in becoming a member of the Council of Europe. In order for Russia to become a member they had to sign a statement of intent in order to be admitted, which they did and gained admission in late 1995. Russia at this time agreed to negotiate claims for the return of cultural property to other European countries, and to return property that was transferred to Moscow in 1945, in a rapid manner. Surprisingly, nothing to this agreement ever occurred or was of any mention in the Russian press; and less than a year later in May 1996 the Duma passed the first reading of the proposed law nationalizing the spoils of war. The law emphasized compensation to Russia for wartime loss.\n\nIt was not long after, in early July 1996, the law was passed almost unanimously, making other European counties very hostile about the law. The passage started a slew of diplomatic protests, and as a result the Russian Upper House, the Council of the Federation, rejected the law strongly because of the outcry from the Yeltsin administration. Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation at the time, and his administration stood strong behind this argument for rejecting the law on the basis that it would conflict with numerous international agreements.\n\nNevertheless, the law continued to gain support from other nationalist-oriented parties, and the push for the passage of the law continued. The chair of the Duma Committee on Culture, Nikolai Gubenko, continued to stress that the law was a must, on the basis that all the cultural property that was transported to what was the Soviet Union was all done so legally according to allied agreements, and that the law is way of providing justice to the loved ones, nearly 30 million, that are no longer with us due to the horrific outcomes of the war. With more gained support, and a slightly revised law, the Duma again almost unanimously passed the law on February 5, 1997, and was further passed by the upper house, the Council of Federation on March 5, 1997.\n\nSticking to what he believed, and despite the ongoing support for the law, President Yeltsin vetoed the law on March 18, 1997. Making his position clear in his official message to the Duma, Yeltsin stood firm that the law was in contradiction of the Constitution. Further Yeltsin pointed out that the law went against Russian bilateral agreements with other European countries.\n\nNotwithstanding the President's power to veto the law, the Council of the Federation overrode Yeltsin's veto, with a vote of 141 to 37 in favor of the law on May 14, 1997. Regardless of the fact that the Council of the Federation overrode Yeltsin's veto, he still refused to sign the law, and further cited allegations of voting irregularities; and repeated his position that the law conflicted Russia's international legal obligations. \nPresident Yeltsin was forced to sign the law by the Constitutional Court in a decision on April 6, 1998. The Constitutional Court ruled that they were unable to consider the constitutionality of the law before the President signed it. So, on April 15, 1998, President Yeltsin signed the law making it officially Federal Law. The Law did return to Constitutional Court in 1999 for review on the basis of unconstitutionality, contradiction of Russia's international legal obligation and alleged irregular voting practices. The ruling of July 20, 1999 did rule in fact that parts of the law were unconstitutional and that parts of the voting process were violated; but despite these findings the law was still validated and found not in conflict with the Constitution. The ruling further stated that the cultural valuables that were relocated to now what is known as Russia at the end of the Second World War should not be returned to the former aggressor countries and should remain in Russia as a form of compensation. The law was sent back to the Duma for amendments to be made in November 1999, and then finally May 25th, 2000, the Federal Law received the Presidential signature from the then President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe Federal Law on Cultural Valuables Displaced to the USSR as a Result of World War II and Located on the Territory of the Russian Federation consists of six Chapters and twenty-five Articles. The Law is aimed at governing cultural valuables displaced to know what is known as Russia. The fundamental goals of the Federal Law are \"to protect said valuables from misappropriation and prevent their illegal export beyond the borders of the Russian Federation as well as their unlawful transfer to whomsoever; to establish the necessary legal bases for treating said cultural valuables as partial compensation for the damage caused to the cultural property of the Russian Federation as a result of the plunder and destruction of its cultural valuables by Germany and its war allies during World War II; to protect the interests of the Russian Federation in the settlement of disputed issues with foreign states concerning said cultural valuables through consistent compliance with the principle of mutuality; to provide a possibility for acquainting citizens of the Russian Federation and foreign citizens, including specialists in the fields of education, science and culture, with said cultural valuables; and to create favorable conditions for the continuous development of international cooperation in the fields of education, science and culture\".\n\nThe Law enacted by the Russian Federation on displaced cultural valuables, has been nothing but been criticized on an international level. A Hungarian specialist cited a large number of issues on how the Russian law violates international law and treaties. But more specifically, emphasized that Hungary is entitled to the restitution of Hungarian property removed to the USSR as a result of the Second World War. Further, similar feelings were expressed by a Ukrainian specialist, who argues that Ukraine and other former Soviet republics should have a say in determining the fate of their cultural valuables, on the basis of international norms and democratic principles. \nA specific criticism of the law is the notion of a limitation period. This is the idea that a claim must be made within 18 months of the information about a specific cultural valuable is published in an appropriate federal agency publication. This strikes a lot of concerns because who decides and what is an adequate publication, and after the 18 months what happens. \nIn 2009, a Ministry of Culture legal specialist wrote that the passage of the law \"would appear as a unilateral Russian rejection of its international obligations and evoke a negative impact on international relations of the Russian Federation with various European governments\". \nRecently, in June 2013, news reports illustrate that the controversy about the appropriation of German artefacts by the USSR, is still on going between Germany's Angela Merkel and Russia's Vladimir Putin. During a visit in St-Petersburg, Angela Merkel, chancellor of Germany, criticized an exhibition at the Hermitage Museum that contained a number of valuables that were stolen from Germany. President Putin declared that the issue is very sensitive and that both sides would continue to talk to resolve the issue.\n"}

During these years Rybon has initiated and conducted numerous projects including art residencies, local and international artist workshops, art shares and artist talks, screenings, enhancing local art networks and facilitating international art exchanges.\n\nIn spite of the history of art residency in the world, in early years of Rybon’s activity this form of art exchange did not have a serious professional background in Iran. Therefore, Rybon from the very beginning concentrated on different forms of art residency which facilitated dialogue and exchange of ideas among artists in Iran.\n\nRybon started its first residency projects in collaboration with local artistic and cultural institutes, inviting established artists from neighboring countries. Holding Rybon International Artists’ Workshop based on Triangle workshops in 2012 in collaboration with Mohsen Gallery and Darbast Platform in Tehran was another step toward establishing residency culture.\n\nImpediments for holding international residencies lead to devising a new form of residency, namely exchange programs, by Rybon. The first of these exchange programs was held in 2013 in collaboration with Organhaus Art Space of China and Mohsen Gallery in Tehran and Chongqing, China. At the present the “Exchange Program” is being successfully practiced as a pivotal part of Kooshk Residency programs.\n\nRybon organised the Second Rybon International Artists's Workshop in 2016 based on Triangle workshops in collaboration with Kooshk Residency, deegar platform and Gasworks. This program aimed to gather artists from all around the world to discuss and look for the possibilities to exchange ideas and knowledge beyond the ethnic, regional and artistic boundaries. Five Asian, European and African artists as well as five Iranian artists participated in this program. The program started on November 10 and lasted until November 25th.\n\n"}

It studies the process of technological change. Under the field of Technology Dynamics the process of technological change is explained by taking into account influences from \"internal factors\" as well as from \"external factors\". Internal factors relate technological change to unsolved technical problems and the established modes of solving technological problems and external factors relate it to various (changing) characteristics of the social environment, in which a particular technology is embedded.\n\nFor the last three decades, it has been argued that technology development is neither an autonomous process, determined by the \"inherent progress\" of human history, nor a process completely determined by external conditions like the prices of the resources that are needed to operate (develop) a technology, as it is theorized in neoclassical economic thinking. In mainstream neoclassical economic thinking, technology is seen as an exogenous factor: at the moment a technology is required, the most appropriate version can be taken down from the shelf based on costs of labor, capital and eventually raw materials.\n\nConversely, modern technology dynamics studies generally advocate that technologies are not \"self-evident\" or market-demanded, but are the upshot of a particular path of technology development and are shaped by social, economic and political factors. in this sense, technology dynamics aims at overcoming distinct \"internal\" and \"external\" points of views by presenting co-evolutionary approach regarding technology development.\n\nIn general, technology dynamics studies, besides giving a \"thick description\" of technology development, uses constructivist viewpoints emphasizing that technology is the outcome of particular social context. Accordingly, Technology Dynamics emphasizes the significance and possibility of regaining social control of technology, and also provides mechanisms needed to adapt to and steer the development of certain technologies. In that respect, it uses insights from retrospective studies to formulate hypotheses of a prospective nature on technology development of emerging technologies, besides formulating prescriptive policy recommendations.\n\nAn important feature of relevant theories of technological change therein is that they underline the quasi-evolutionary character of technological change: change based on technological variation and social selection in which technological knowledge, systems and institutions develop in interaction with each other. Processes of 'path dependence' are crucial in explaining technological change.\n\nFollowing these lines, there have been different approaches and concepts used under the field of technology dynamics.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the various perspectives, one can aim at developing interventions in the dynamics of a technology. Some approaches have been developed targeting on interventions in technological change:\n\n\n\n"}

The online version of Merriam-Webster defined it as \"a major writing assignment in a school or college course representative of a student's achievement during a term\". Term papers are generally intended to describe an event, a concept, or argue a point. It is a written original work discussing a topic in detail, usually several typed pages in length, and is often due at the end of a semester.\n\nThere is much overlap between the terms: \"research paper\" and \"term paper\". A \"term paper\" was originally a written assignment (usually a research based paper) that was due at the end of the \"term\"—either a semester or quarter, depending on which unit of measure a school used. However, not all term papers involve academic research, and not all research papers are term papers.\n\nTerm papers date back to the beginning of the 19th century when print could be reproduced cheaply and written texts of all types (reports, memoranda, specifications, and scholarly articles) could be easily produced and disseminated. Moulton and Holmes (2003) write that during the years from 1870 to 1900 \"American education was transformed as writing became a method of discourse and research the hallmark of learning.\"\n\nRussell (1991) writes that in the 1910s, \"the research paper began to harden into its familiar form\" adding that plagiarism and the sale of research papers both became a problem during this time.\n\nIn the present day an entire industry has sprung up to provide plagiarized, pre-written or custom written term papers for students of varying levels of education. There are many websites that sell term papers of all levels of quality and writing proficiency, but submission of a purchased paper would be considered a serious breach the submitting student's academic integrity by any reputable academic institution. Also, plagiarism can be unknowingly committed by students. Although plagiarism can be unknowingly committed there are quite a few steps that can be taken in order to avoid plagiarizing. When quoting another author's work, place quotation marks around the words or sentence that you take from that work, and use a footnote, end-note, or in-line citation to give credit to the original source. Merely changing a few words is not the same as true summarizing, and use of such a minorly-modified passage is still considered plagiarism unless a citation gives credit to the source.\n\n\n"}

They are found in many parts of the world, such as Finland, Sweden, Norway, and northern Russia, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United States. Huts range from being basic and unmanned, without running water, to furnished and permanently attended. Remote huts sometimes contain emergency food supplies.\n\nSimilar shelters can also be found in remote areas of the Alps (known in German as \"Biwakschachtel\"). In order to complete some tours, it is necessary to spend the night in such shelters. Even though \"Biwakschachteln\" are also tended to by the Alpine Clubs, they differ markedly from the more accessible mountain huts, which are actual houses suitable for permanent use. Unlike mountain huts, they do not have a permanent resident who tends to the building and sells food to mountaineers.\n\nIn general, these huts do not have regular maintenance schedules nor paid maintenance staff. Unofficial rules for use have arisen.\nVisitors are expected to leave the hut as they would like to find it. Fires should never be left unattended, and if the firewood supply is used up, the visitors should replace it. Some areas are designated fuel stove only, because cooking on a fuel stove can reduce the use of firewood. Some huts contain emergency food stores like canned food and bottled water, meant to consumed in urgent situations. Often no toilet facilities are present, and the general rule requires that toilet waste should be buried away from the nearest watercourse or the hut.\nGenerally no running water is available in the huts. It is often recommended when using water from a stream, that the water should be boiled for at least five minutes because of the potential danger of gastroenteritis and giardia.\nDetergents, toothpaste and soap (even biodegradable types) can harm aquatic life, and waterways are easily damaged. When leaving the hut, visitors are generally expected to leave it clean and secure, with the fire out, and the doors and windows securely closed. Escaping fires can severely damage the environment. Rubbish should not be buried. Rubbish like cans, plastic bottles or broken glass are often dug out by native animals and may harm them. All waste should be disposed of by taking it away for proper disposal. Rules can differ between Europe, Australia and US.\n\nOfficial wilderness huts are mostly maintained by Metsähallitus (Finnish for \"Administration of Forests\"), the Finnish state-owned forest management company. Most of the wilderness huts in Finland are situated in the northern and eastern parts of the country. Their size can vary greatly: the Lahtinen cottage in the Muotkatunturi Wilderness Area can barely hold two people, whereas the Luirojärvi cottage in the Urho Kekkonen National Park can hold as many as 16.\n\nA wilderness hut need not be reserved beforehand, and they are open for everyone tracking by foot, ski or similar means. Commercial stays overnight are prohibited in the wilderness huts owned by Metsähallitus. Unofficial and unmaintained huts also exist.\n\nFor centuries the vast wildernesses of Finland and its resources were divided amongst the Finnish agricultural societies (such as families, villages, parishes, and provinces) for the purpose of collecting resources. Areas divided in this way were called \"erämaa\", literally \"portion-land,\" (now literally the word for \"wilderness\" in modern Finnish). People from agricultural societies made trips to their \"erämaas\" in the summer, mainly to trap animals for fur but also to hunt game, fish, and collect taxes from the local hunter-fisher population.\n\nHuts were built in the wilderness for use as base camps for hunters and fishermen. Also non-agricultural Sami people built huts to help them manage reindeer. The earliest huts were only allowed to be used by people from the communities that owned them. Outsiders were not allowed to use the resources of other communities' \"erämaas\".\n\nHuts that were free for everyone were first seen in late 18th century Finland, when dwelling places were built along walking routes for passers-by. In the 19th century the authorities started building these huts. Later in the 20th century they started to be built for travellers.\n\nNew Zealand has a network of approximately 950 backcountry huts. The huts are officially maintained by the Department of Conservation (DOC), although some of the huts have been adopted and maintained by local hiking and hunting clubs by arrangement. There are also unofficial and privately owned huts in some places. They vary from small bivouac shelters made of wood to large modern huts that can sleep up to 40 people, with separate cooking areas, utilities and gas.\n\nSome huts were initially commissioned or built by clubs along commonly walked routes, both for safety reasons as appropriate, and sometimes for convenience. The network of back-country huts in New Zealand was largely extended in the mid-20th-century, when many more were built to serve the deer cullers of the New Zealand Forest Service. Most larger and more modern huts, like some found on the Great Walks, have been purpose designed and built to serve trampers. Many of New Zealand's back-country huts are remote and rarely visited, and it is common for recreational trampers to design trips with the idea of reaching and visiting specific huts. Some people actively keep count of which huts they have visited, a practice which is informally referred to as hut bagging.\n\nBack-country huts in New Zealand were free to use until the early 1990s, when the New Zealand Department of Conservation began charging for their use. For most back-country huts, nightly hut tickets are purchased via an honesty system by people who use the huts, with an additional option of purchasing an annual pass for people who use huts frequently. Huts on frequently used and heavily marketed tracks, such as the New Zealand Great Walks, usually operate on a booking system, and often have resident wardens checking the bookings of users who arrive to stay the night.\n\nSince the inception of hut fees in New Zealand, there has been controversy amongst some hut users. Many users belong to clubs which helped to build and maintain the huts before the government department was created, and consequently inherited them. It is common to find people who refuse to pay for the use of huts in protest, arguing that the government is trying to charge them to use facilities that they themselves are entirely responsible for providing. DOC argues that all hut fees are used for the continued maintenance of huts, and for building new huts as appropriate. It has at times made efforts to demonstrate this by specifically allocating money from hut fees towards budgets for these purposes.\n\nThe majority of the huts were built in an era of lower levels of government regulation and the long term use of the huts was not considered. As a result of the Cave Creek disaster in 1995, DOC tightened up on the standards for structures on public land. Some of the huts were upgraded to meet build regulations whilst others were removed or had certain facilities (such as beds) removed to cause them to fall into less strict building categories. In 2008, because of the recognition of the unique situation and the remote locations, the government relaxed the building standards for the huts. They now no longer need to have emergency lighting, smoke alarms, wheelchair access, potable water supplies or artificial lighting.\n\nIn the United States, backcountry huts may be provided by the Forest Service, state or national parks such as the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Wilderness huts are frequently located along hiking routes.\n\nThe Tenth Mountain Huts is a system of 29 backcountry huts in the Colorado Rocky Mountains honoring the men of 10th Mountain Division of the US Army, who trained during World War II at Camp Hale in central Colorado. They provide a unique opportunity for backcountry skiing, mountain biking, or hiking while staying in safe, comfortable shelter. \n\n\n\n"}

The name derives from the French term à gogo (in abundance, galore). It is considered a continuation of café society, who were also wealthy socialites and prominent members of the arts and sciences. Participants were often referred to as \"the go crowd\", \"the in crowd\" and later as \"the jet set\". These are terms created and applied by the media to identify people of certain mindset and do not refer to any formal organization. To put the movement in context, it should be considered an aspect of social behavior existing under the overarching movement of post World War II modernism.\n\nThis article refers to the European à gogo movement, and should not be confused with the American gogo music that followed, borrowing certain elements from it years later.\n"}
