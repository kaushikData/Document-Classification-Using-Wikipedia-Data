The philosopher Aristotle wrote in his \"Rhetoric\":\n\nHowever, artificiality does not necessarily have a negative connotation, as it may also reflect the ability of humans to replicate forms or functions arising in nature, as with an artificial heart or artificial intelligence. Political scientist and artificial intelligence expert Herbert A. Simon observes that \"some artificial things are imitations of things in nature, and the imitation may use either the same basic materials as those in the natural object or quite different materials. Simon distinguishes between the artificial and the synthetic, the former being an imitation of something found in nature (for example, an artificial sweetener which generates sweetness using a formula not found in nature), and the latter being a replication of something found in nature (for example, a sugar created in a laboratory that is chemically indistinguishable from a naturally occurring sugar). Some philosophers have gone further and asserted that, in a deterministic world, \"everything is natural and nothing is artificial\", because everything in the world (including everything made by humans) is a product of the physical laws of the world.\n\nIt is generally possible for humans, and in some instances, for computers, to distinguish natural from artificial environments. The artificial environment tends to have more physical regularity both spatially and over time, with natural environments tending to have both irregular structures and structures that change over time. However, on close observation it is possible to discern some mathematical structures and patterns in natural environments, which can then be replicated to create an artificial environment with a more natural appearance.\n\nFor example, by identifying and imitating natural means of pattern formation, some types of automata have been used to generate organic-looking textures for more realistic shading of 3D objects.\n\n"}
{"id": "4880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4880", "title": "Bildungsroman", "text": "Bildungsroman\n\nIn literary criticism, a Bildungsroman (; \"bildung\", meaning \"education\", and \"roman\", meaning \"novel\"; English: \"novel of formation, education, culture\"; \"coming-of-age story\") is a literary genre that focuses on the psychological and moral growth of the protagonist from youth to adulthood (coming of age), in which character change is extremely important.\n\nThe term was coined in 1819 by philologist Karl Morgenstern in his university lectures, and later famously reprised by Wilhelm Dilthey, who legitimized it in 1870 and popularized it in 1905. The genre is further characterized by a number of formal, topical, and thematic features. The term \"coming-of-age novel\" is sometimes used interchangeably with \"Bildungsroman\", but its use is usually wider and less technical.\n\nThe birth of the Bildungsroman is normally dated to the publication of \"Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship\" by Johann Wolfgang Goethe in 1795–96, or, sometimes, to Christoph Martin Wieland's \"Geschichte des Agathon\" of 1767. Although the \"Bildungsroman\" arose in Germany, it has had extensive influence first in Europe and later throughout the world. Thomas Carlyle translated Goethe's novel into English, and after its publication in 1824, many British authors wrote novels inspired by it. In the 20th century, it spread to Germany, Britain, France, and several other countries around the globe.\n\nThe genre translates fairly directly into cinematic form, the coming-of-age film.\n\nA \"Bildungsroman\" relates the growing up or \"coming of age\" of a sensitive person who goes in search of answers to life's questions with the expectation that these will result in gaining experience of the world. The genre evolved from folklore tales of a dunce or youngest child going out in the world to seek his fortune. Usually in the beginning of the story there is an emotional loss which makes the protagonist leave on his/her journey. In a \"Bildungsroman\", the goal is maturity, and the protagonist achieves it gradually and with difficulty. The genre often features a main conflict between the main character and society. Typically, the values of society are gradually accepted by the protagonist and he/she is ultimately accepted into society—the protagonist's mistakes and disappointments are over. In some works, the protagonist is able to reach out and help others after having achieved maturity.\n\nFranco Moretti \"argues that the main conflict in the \"Bildungsroman\" is the myth of modernity with its overvaluation of youth and progress as it clashes with the static teleological vision of happiness and reconciliation found in the endings of Goethe's \"Wilhelm Meister\" and even Jane Austen's \"Pride and Prejudice\"\".\n\nThere are many variations and subgenres of \"Bildungsroman\" that focus on the growth of an individual. An \"Entwicklungsroman\" (\"development novel\") is a story of general growth rather than self-cultivation. An \"Erziehungsroman\" (\"education novel\") focuses on training and formal schooling, while a \"Künstlerroman\" (\"artist novel\") is about the development of an artist and shows a growth of the self. Furthermore, some memoirs and published journals can be regarded as \"Bildungsroman\" although being predominantly factual (e.g. \"The Dharma Bums\" by Jack Kerouac or\" The Motorcycle Diaries\" by Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara). The term is also more loosely used to describe coming-of-age films and related works in other genres.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is sometimes called Pseudo-Jasher to distinguish it from the midrashic Sefer haYashar (\"Book of the Upright,\" Naples, 1552), which incorporates genuine Jewish legend.\n\nPublished in November 1751, the title page of the book says: \"translated into English by Flaccus Albinus Alcuinus, of Britain, Abbot of Canterbury, who went on a pilgrimage into the Holy Land and Persia, where he discovered this volume in the city of Gazna.\" The book claims to be written by Jasher, son of Caleb, one of Moses's lieutenants, who later judged Israel at Shiloh. The covers biblical history from the creation down to Jasher's own day and was represented as the Lost Book of Jasher mentioned in the Bible.\n\nThe provenance of the text was immediately suspect: Alcuin of the 8th-century could not have produced a translation in the English of the King James Bible. There is an introductory account by Alcuin of his discovery of the manuscript in Persia and its history since the time of Jasher, and a commendation by John Wycliffe.\n\nThe supposed lost book was declared an obvious hoax by the \"Monthly Review\" in the December of the year of publication, and the printer Jacob Ilive was sentenced in 1756 to three years in jail for this fraud and for his radical anti-religious pamphlets.\n\nIn 1829, a slightly revised and enlarged edition was published in Bristol, provoking attacks against it.

A film adaptation by the same name was released in 2002 and starred Bruce Campbell as the lead character of Elvis.\n\nIn this story, the real Elvis Presley switched places years ago with an Elvis impersonator. Tired of the life of drugs, women, and people who wanted nothing more than his money, he settles in to live a life of obscurity in a East Texas trailer park, where he becomes the best Elvis impersonator ever. Then his health begins to fail, and he falls from a stage and breaks his hip. His trailer burns down and with it all evidence that proves he was the real Elvis Presley. He ends up in a shabby retirement home, which is where the story starts.\n\nLate at night, Elvis hears scuttling noises and other creepy sounds in the otherwise quiet Mud Creek Shady Grove Convalescence Home. He befriends a black man, who's convinced he's John F. Kennedy, and the two begin to piece together that an Egyptian mummy is stalking the halls and sucking up souls in the night. Together the two men confront the monster, as no one will believe them.\n\nA film adaptation of \"Bubba Ho-Tep\" was released in 2002 and was directed by Don Coscarelli, who also wrote the film's screenplay. Bruce Campbell was brought in to portray the film's lead character of Elvis Presley and Ossie Davis as Kennedy. Due to a successful roadshow theatrical release held by Coscarelli, \"Bubba Ho-Tep\" quickly obtained cult movie status.\n\nIn 2018, IDW Publishing released a five-issue limited series prequel, \"Bubba Ho-Tep and the Cosmic Blood-Suckers\". The series was supervised by Lansdale, written by Joshua Jabcuga, and illustrated by Tadd Galusha.\n\n\"Kirkus Reviews\" heavily criticized \"Bubba Ho-Tep\" upon its initial release, as they considered the story to be one of the worst of the Elvis anthology as they thought that Lansdale \"spends too much time on The King's hard-ons\" and that \"too much bad writing leaves the reader all shook up and itchin like a man on a fuzzy tree\".\n"}

It was the preferred choice of clothing for women of upper and middle classes for daily wear. The practice of daily wear died out at the beginning of the 20th century. Unlike the typical sampot, it is more of a pant than a skirt. It is a rectangular piece of cloth measuring three meters long and one meter wide. It is worn by wrapping it around the waist, stretching it away from the body, twisting the ends together then pulling the twisted fabric between the legs and tucking it in the back of the waist.\n\nThe history of sampot chang kben dates back to ancient Cambodia, where deities were often portrayed wearing such styles. References to most Khmer elders told a legend related to this garment. It said that a long time ago, the Khmer people worn sampot chang kben, following the Indian tradition. In those times, India provided many religions, but the most important one was Hinduism, as the Khmer king at that time built the temples such as Angkor Wat, also dedicated to Hinduism. In the era of the Khmer empire, most of the people were likely to read and see The Reamker at the Angkor Wat carving in the first floor as well. The origin of sampot chang kben is known as Indian. Also prayed and blessed to was a deva known as Hanuman, the guard of Prince Rama in India's famous mythology, \"Ramayana\", as well as the Khmer adaptation, \"Reamker\". To show its power, Indians preferred to wear the sampot chang kben as their costume but today, countries under the Greater India, such as Cambodia, also wear it for special occasions.\n\nIn Ramayana mythology, Hanuman is a symbol of bravery, cleverness, and power, so the people, when wearing the sampot chang kben, always drop a tail at the back like Hanuman's monkey tail. This practice lead a lot of people to believe that all Indians were guards of Hanuman. The influence of sampot chang kben, known as Dhoti in India, were strongly sacked into Khmer culture from the ancient times to today. Apparently, this fabric is also known to be worn by Tamil people in south India, as well as Khmer people, till today.\n\nIn fact, sampot chang kben is the tradition of southern India, and was imported to early Cambodian Kingdom, Funan by \"King Kaundinya I\".\n\nIn the middle of the 13th and 14th centuries, Thai people (from Sukhothai Kingdom, known as Thailand today) and Lao people (from Lan Xang, known as Lao today) had adopted the wearing of sampot chang kben because they considered it superior for enjoying the special occasions, and useful for royalty or monarchy in their local royal palace, because the Thai people and Lao people had used sampot chang kben in a similar way.\nIn ancient times, the sampot chang kben was worn only by men, but in modern times, it is worn by both men and women, especially for a formal celebration. It is, for instance, worn by a bride and groom in a Khmer wedding. The general style of the garment has changed over the years:\n\nToday, the sampot chang kben is worn mostly for formal occasions, or by royalty.\n\n"}

Charter schools are an example of public asset privatization.\n\nThere is ongoing debate on whether charter schools ought to be described as private schools or state schools. Advocates of the charter model state that they are public schools because they are open to all students and do not charge tuition, while critics cite charter schools' private operation and loose regulations regarding public accountability and labor issues as arguments against the concept.\n\nAll Australian private schools have received some federal government funding since the 1970s. Since then they have educated approximately 30% of high school students. None of them are charter schools, because they all charge tuition fees. \n\nSince 2009, the Government of Western Australia has trialed the Independent Public School (IPS) Initiative. These public schools have greater autonomy and could be regarded as akin to 'charter' Schools (but the term is not used in Australia).\n\nThe Canadian province of Alberta enacted legislation in 1994 enabling charter schools. The first charter schools under the new legislation were established in 1995: New Horizons Charter School, Suzuki Charter School, and the Centre for Academic and Personal Excellence. , Alberta remains the only Canadian province that has enabled charter schools.\n\nThere are 23 charter school campuses operated by 13 Alberta charter schools. The number of charter schools is limited to a maximum of 15.\n\nChile has a long history of private subsidized schooling, akin to charter schooling in the United States. Before the 1980s, most private subsidized schools were religious and owned by churches or other private parties, but they received support from the central government. In the 1980s, the government of Augusto Pinochet promoted neoliberal reforms in the country. In 1981 a competitive voucher system in education was adopted. These vouchers could be used in public schools or private subsidized schools (which can be run for profit). After this reform, the share of private subsidized schools, many of them secular, grew from 18.5% of schools in 1980 to 32.7% of schools in 2001. As of 2012, nearly 60% of Chilean students study in charter schools.\n\nColombia, like Chile, has a long tradition of religious and private schools. With the economic crisis of religious orders, different levels of the state have had to finance these schools to keep them functioning. Also, in some cities such as Bogotá, there are programs of private schools financed by public resources, giving education access to children from poor sectors. These cases, however, are very small and about 60% of children and young people study in private schools paid for by their families. Moreover, private schools have higher quality than public ones.\n\nThe United Kingdom established grant-maintained schools in England and Wales in 1988. They allowed individual schools that were independent of the local school authority. When they were abolished in 1998, most turned into foundation schools, which are really under their local district authority but still have a high degree of autonomy.\n\nPrior to the 2010 general election, there were about 200 academies (publicly funded schools with a significant degree of autonomy) in England. The Academies Act 2010 aims to vastly increase this number.\n\nDue to Art. 7 of the \"Grundgesetz\" (German constitution), private schools may only be set up if they do not increase the segregation of pupils by their parents' income class. In return, all private schools are supported financially by government bodies, comparable to charter schools. The amount of control over school organization, curriculum etc. taken over by the state differs from state to state and from school to school. Average financial support given by government bodies was 85% of total costs in 2009. Academically, all private schools must lead their students to the ability to attain standardized, government-provided external tests such as the \"Abitur\".\n\nSome private schools in Hong Kong receive government subsidy under the Direct Subsidy Scheme (DSS). DSS schools are free to design their curriculum, select their own students, and charge for tuition. A number of DSS schools were formerly state schools prior to joining the scheme.\n\nCharter schools in New Zealand, labelled as Partnership schools | kura hourua, were allowed for after an agreement between the National Party and the ACT Party following the 2011 general election. The controversial legislation passed with a five-vote majority. A small number of charter schools started in 2013 and 2014. All cater for students who have struggled in the normal state school system. Most of the students have issues with drugs, alcohol, poor attendance and achievement. Most of the students are Maori or Pacific Islander. One of the schools is set up as a military academy. One of the schools ran into major difficulties within weeks of starting. It is now being run by an executive manager from Child, Youth and Family, a government social welfare organization, together with a commissioner appointed by the Ministry of Education. 36 organizations have applied to start charter schools.\n\nAs in Sweden, the publicly funded but privately run charter schools in Norway are named \"friskoler\" and was formally instituted in 2003, but dismissed in 2007. Private schools have since medieval times been a part of the education system, and is today consisting of 63 Montessori and 32 Steiner (Waldorf) charter schools, some religious schools and 11 non-governmental funded schools like the Oslo International School, the German School Max Tau and the French School Lycée Français, a total of 195 schools.\n\nAll charter schools can have a list of admission priorities, but only the non-governmental funded schools are allowed to select their students and to make a profit. The charter schools cannot have entrance exams, and supplemental fees are very restricted. In 2013, a total of 19,105 children were enrolled in privately run schools.\n\nThe Swedish system of \"friskolor\" (\"charter schools\") was instituted in 1992. These are publicly funded by school vouchers and can be run by not-for-profits as well as for-profit companies. The schools are restricted: for example, they are prohibited from supplementing the public funds with tuition or other fees; pupils must be admitted on a first-come, first-served basis; and entrance exams are not permitted. There are about 900 charter schools throughout the country.\n\nAccording to the Education Commission of the States, \"charter schools are semi-autonomous public schools that receive public funds. They operate under a written contract with a state, district or other entity (referred to as an authorizer or sponsor). This contract - or charter - details how the school will be organized and managed, what students will be expected to achieve, and how success will be measured. Many charters are exempt from a variety of laws and regulations affecting other public schools if they continue to meet the terms of their charters.\"\nMinnesota wrote the first charter school law in the United States in 1991. , Minnesota had 165 registered charter schools, with over 41,000 students attending. The first of these to be approved, Bluffview Montessori School in Winona, Minnesota, opened in 1992. The first charter to operate was City Academy in St. Paul. Some specialized Minnesota charter-schools include the Metro Deaf School (1993), Community of Peace Academy (1995), and the Mainstreet School of Performing Arts (2004).\n\nOne could argue, the most radical experimentation with charter schools in the United States occurred in New Orleans, Louisiana in the wake of Hurricane Katrina (2005). the New Orleans Public Schools system was engaged in reforms aimed at decentralizing power away from the pre-Katrina public School Board to individual charter school principals and boards, monitoring charter school performance by granting renewable, five-year operating contracts permitting the closure of those not succeeding, and parents the choice to enroll their children in almost any school in the district. New Orleans is one of two cities in the United States of America where the majority of school students attend charter schools. 78% of all New Orleans schoolchildren studied in charter schools during the 2011–12 school year. , all but five of New Orleans' schools were charter schools rather than public schools.\n\nUnlike their counterparts, laws governing charter schools vary greatly from state to state. In this regard the three states with the highest number of students enrolled in charter schools are California, Arizona, and Michigan. These differences largely relate to what types of public agencies are permitted to authorize the creation of charter schools, whether or not and through what processes private schools can convert to charter schools, and whether or not charter school teachers need to be certified and what that certification consists of.\n\nIn California, local school districts are the most frequent granters of school charters. If a local school district denies a charter application, or if the proposed charter school provides services not provided by the local school districts, a county board consisting of superintendents from state schools or the state board of education can grant a charter. The Arizona State Board for Charter Schools grants charters in Arizona. Local school districts and the state board of education can also grant charters. In contrast, the creation of charter schools in Michigan can be authorized only by local school boards or by the governing school boards of state colleges and universities.\n\nDifferent states with charter-school legislation have adopted widely different positions in regard to the conversion of private schools to charter schools. California, for example, does not allow the conversion of pre-existing private schools into charter schools. Both Arizona and Michigan allow such conversions, but with different requirements. A private school wishing to convert to a charter school in Michigan, for example, must show that at least 25% of its student population is made up of new students. Legislation in Arizona stipulates that private schools that wish to become charter schools within that state must have admission policies that are fair and non-discriminatory. Also, while Michigan and California require teachers at charter schools to hold state certification, those in Arizona do not.\n\nCharter schools were targeted as a major component of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2002. Specifically, the act specifies that students attending schools labeled as under-performing by state standards now have the option to transfer to a different school in the district, whether it is a state, private, or charter school. The act also suggested that if a failing school cannot show adequate yearly progress, it will be designated a charter school.\n\nThere is strong demand for charter schools from the private sector. Typically, charter schools operate as nonprofits. However, the buildings in which they operate are generally owned by private landlords. Accordingly, this asset class is generating interest from real-estate investors who are looking towards the development of new schools. State and local governments have also shown willingness to help with financing. Charter schools have grown in popularity over the recent past. In 2014-2015, 500 new charter schools opened in the country. , 6,700 charter schools enroll approximately 2.9 million students in the United States.\n\nCharter cyber schools operate like typical charter schools in that they are independently organized schools, but are conducted partly or entirely over the Internet. Proponents say this allows for much more flexibility compared with traditional schools.\n\nFor 2000-2001, studies estimated 40-50,000 online K-12 students nationally. Six years later, a study by Picciano and Seamon (2006) found that over 1 million students were involved. These numbers increased to 6.7 million students in 2013. A study by Watson, Murin, Vashaw, Gemin, and Rapp found that cyber charter schools are currently (as of 2014) operating in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nThe increase of these online campuses has caused controversy among the education system. In November 2015 researchers at the University of Washington, Stanford University and the Mathematica Policy Research group published the first major study into online charter schools in the United States, the \"National Study of Online Charter Schools\". It found \"significantly weaker academic performance\" in mathematics and reading in such schools when compared to conventional ones. The study resulted from research carried out in 17 US states which had online charter schools. It concluded that keeping online pupils focused on their work was the biggest problem faced by online charter schools and that in mathematics the difference in attainment between online pupils and their conventionally-educated peers equated to the cyber pupils missing a whole academic year in school.\n\nFour states have adopted specific legislation tailored to cyber charter schools. One example is Arizona, which has about 3,500 students in cyber schools, about half of them cyber charter schools and the other half governed by traditional, bricks and mortar public school districts. The cyber schools teach students from kindergarten to twelfth grade, and the setting varies from being entirely online in one's home to spending all of the class time in a formal school building while learning over the Internet.\n\nCyber charter school diplomas have been unevenly valued by post-secondary institutions. Universities sometimes apply additional requirements or have cyber-charter quotas limiting the number of applicants. The US military also classifies non-traditional diplomas at a lower tier, although as of 2012 this could be bypassed by high ASVAB test scores.\n\nCharter schools have gradually become popular since the system was introduced in 1996. The United States Department of Education defined these institutions as “\"public schools that do not charge tuition fees established through a charter or agreement between the school and local district school board\".” Through said accord, the charter school gets more autonomy proportional to conventional public schools in exchange for the higher level of accountability.\n\nA policy statement from the National Education Association implemented by the Representative Assembly in 2017 stated that the NEA vows a strong public schools system for American students. Charter schools are funded by taxpayers so there must be the same liability, transparency, safeguards, and impartiality as public schools. 44 American states along with the District of Columbia implement legislation on state charter schools. However, many states do not compel charters to abide by open meeting statutes as well as prerequisites on conflict of interest that pertain to school districts, boards, and employees. The NEA was quoted as declaring that certain state laws, rules, and guidelines may still be relevant to charter schools. These institutions are not supervised by the state but by a board of directors. The establishment of charter schools was meant to promote competition among students and provide parents with more options for enrolling their children. Heightened competition can result in effective educational programs nationwide.\n\nDepartment of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos espoused “school choice” before accepting the position in President Donald Trump’s administration. School choice refers to spending funds allocated for public charter schools and some private school. DeVos said in a media interview on March 12, 2018, that charter schools can improve the long-established public school system. Betsy DeVos was a campaigner for the American Federation of Children. The National Alliance for Public Charter Schools circulated a research study, “The Health of the Public School Charter Movement: A State by State Analysis.” This report pointed out data regarding the movement’s condition along indicators of quality, progress, and innovation.\n\n"}

The coffee ceremony was first practiced in Ethiopia and Eritrea. There is a routine of serving coffee on a daily basis, mainly for the purpose of getting together with relatives, neighbors, or other visitors. If coffee is politely declined, then tea (\"Chai\") will most likely be served.\n\nLoose grass is spread on the floor where the coffee ceremony is held, often decorated with small yellow flowers. Composite flowers are sometimes used, especially around the celebration of Meskel. \n\nThe ceremony is typically performed by the woman of the household and is considered an honor. The coffee is brewed by first roasting the green coffee beans over an open flame in a pan . This is followed by the grinding of the beans, traditionally in a wooden mortar and pestle. The coffee grounds are then put into a special vessel which contain boiled water and will be left on an open flame a couple of minutes until it is well mixed with the hot water. After grinding, the coffee is put through a sieve several times. The boiling pot (jebena) is usually made of pottery and has a spherical base, a neck and pouring spout, and a handle where the neck connects with the base. The jebena also has a straw lid.\n\nThe host pours the coffee for all participants by moving the tilted boiling pot over a tray with small, handleless cups from a height of one foot without stop until each cup is full. The grounds are brewed three times: the first round of coffee is called \"awel\" in Tigrinya, the second \"kale'i\" and the third \"baraka\" ('to be blessed'). The coffee ceremony may also include burning of various traditional incense. People add sugar to their coffee, or in the countryside, sometimes salt or traditional butter (see \"niter kibbeh\"). The beverage is accompanied by a small snack such as popcorn, peanuts or himbasha (also called \"ambasha\").\n\n"}

The way that these abstract ideas are manifested through the remains that these peoples have left can be investigated and debated often by drawing inferences and using approaches developed in fields such as semiotics, psychology and the wider sciences.\nHumans do not behave under the influence of their senses alone but also through their past experiences such as their upbringing. These experiences contribute to each individual's unique view of the world, a kind of cognitive map that guides them. Groups of people living together tend to develop a shared view of the world and similar cognitive maps which in turn influence their group material culture.\n\nArchaeologists have always tried to imagine what motivated people but early efforts to understand how they thought were unstructured and speculative. Since the rise of processualism these approaches have become more scientific, paying close attention to the Archaeological context of archaeological finds and all possible interpretations. For example, a prehistoric bâton de commandement served an unknown purpose but using cognitive archaeology to interpret it would involve evaluating all its possible functions using clearly defined procedures and comparisons. By applying logic and experimental evidence, the most likely functions can be isolated.\n\nThe multiple interpretations of an artifact, archaeological site or symbol are affected by the archaeologist's own experiences and ideas as well as those of the distant cultural tradition that created it. Cave art for example may not have been art in the modern sense at all but perhaps the product of ritual. Similarly, it would likely have described activities that were perfectly obvious to the people who created it but the symbology employed will be different from that used today or at any other time.\n\nSome archaeologists such as Lewis Binford have critiqued cognitive archaeology, stating that it is only people's actions rather than their thoughts that are preserved in the archaeological record. However it can be argued that even this evidence of actions is still the product of human thought and would have been governed by a multitude of experiences and perspectives. Thus one can see Cognitive Archaeology as a development of Processual Archaeology in that the combination of material culture and actions can be further developed into a study of the ideas which drove action and used objects. This method attempts to avoid the pitfalls of Post-Processual Archaeology by retaining the 'scientific' aspects of Processual Archaeology while reaching for the higher social levels of ideas.\n\nArchaeologist Thomas Huffman defines cognitive archaeology as the study of prehistoric ideology: the ideals, values, and beliefs that constitute a society's worldview. Cognitive archaeologists use the principles of sociocultural anthropology to investigate such diverse things as material symbols, the use of space, political power, and religion. For example, Huffman uses oral history sources from Zimbabwe and Portuguese documents to attempt to explain symbols discovered in the ruins of Great Zimbabwe, specifically connecting the Shona people's historical association of the right with men and the left with women to the placement of entrances to stone structures. This cognitive archaeological approach may be problematic in its logical leaps and incomplete use of archaeological sources, as historian David Beach has pointed out, demonstrating the care that must be used when attempting to explain deep-time intentionality using archaeological evidence. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "31878299", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31878299", "title": "Cuisine of Montevideo", "text": "Cuisine of Montevideo\n\nCuisine of Montevideo refers to the food cooked and served in the city of Montevideo, Uruguay. The cuisine served in the city is similar to that consumed in the country as a whole with beef being a staple of the diet and found in a range of foods and \"torta frita\", a pan-fried cake. However, given the influx of immigrants and tourists into the capital over the decades and centuries, a range of cultural culinary influences can be found in the city.\n\nIn recent years the number of restaurants and diversity of cuisine has increased considerably, Lonely Planet describes the Montevideo culinary scene as \"just starting to get exciting\" with the variety of restaurants springing up in the city from traditional Uruguayan cuisine to Japanese cuisine and Middle Eastern cuisine. \"Restaurant Arcadia\" atop the Plaza Victoria on the 25th floor of the Radisson Montevideo Victoria Plaza Hotel is widely regarded to be the finest restaurant in the city.\n\nA \"torta frita\" is a pan-fried cake consumed in Montevideo and throughout Uruguay. It is generally circular, with a small cut in the centre for cooking, and is made from wheat flour, yeast, water and sugar or salt. Beef is very important in Uruguayan cuisine and an essential part of many dishes. Many of the restaurants serve beef steaks, pork or chicken dishes. Given that Montevideo is a coastal city, it is also provided by a plentiful supply of fresh fish which alongside beef and chicken is very important in the Montevideo cuisine. Some restaurants like \"Che Montevideo\" on the Rambla Gandhi in the Pocitos area of the city on the coast specialize in fresh seafood.\n\nThe centre of traditional Uruguayan food and beverage in Montevideo is the Mercado del Puerto (\"Port Market\"). This complex contains a considerable range of restaurants and cafes. \"La Palenque\" restaurant serves Uruguayan and Spanish cuisine with a variety of lamb, pork and cold meats dishes with vegetables, paella, rice and shellfish. Additionally, the market is host to various cultural events on Saturdays.\n\nThe Mercado del Puerto is the city's most famous area for parillas (\"barbecues\"). The open-aired building which houses the market was built in 1868. While originally a venue for fresh produce, it is now filled with parillas. The structure was built in the style of a nineteenth-century British Railway station. It is listed among \"The Best Markets\" in South America by \"Frommer's\".\n\nMontevideo has a variety of restaurants, from traditional Uruguayan cuisine to Japanese cuisine such as sushi. Western fast-food chains such as McDonald's, and Burger King are evident in the city, showing the forces of globalization.\n\nThe Restaurante Arcadia, on the 25th floor of the Radisson Montevideo Victoria Plaza Hotel\nis considered Montevideo's best restaurant.\"Arcadia\" is set in a classic Italian-inspired dining room and serves lavish dishes such as terrine of pheasant marinated in cognac, grilled lamb glazed with mint and garlic, and duck confit on thin strudel pastry with red cabbage.\n\"El Fogon\" is more popular with the late-night diners of the city. Its interior is brightly lit and the walls covered with big mirrors. Officially a barbecue and seafood restaurant, it serves grilled meat dishes, as well as salmon, shrimp and calamari. Also of note is the \"Cru\". Numerous restaurants are located along the Rambla of Montevideo.\n\n\"Kokoro\" is a Japanese restaurant located on Viejo Pancho in the \"barrio\" of Pocitos. It serves traditional Japanese cuisine, mainly dishes with meat and fish to suit the Uruguayan palette. Its dishes range from appetizers such as a dumpling of salmon and nira, to Sauteed whitefish with Teriyaki sauce and white rice to rolled sushi and sashimi and Japanese curry and rice with Wagyu (beef) or chicken. Deserts include green tea ice cream and apple rolls.\n\n\"Kazbah\" is Middle Eastern restaurant located on the Bartolomé Mitre. It serves dishes such as falafel, schwarma (doner kebabs), couscous and tagin.\n\"Panini's\" is a notable Italian restaurant located in the Ciudad Vieja historical area of the city, just off the Plaza Independencia, and is testament to the influences of some of the Uruguayan Italian immigrants. It is noted in particular for its \"degustación de pastas\", described as \"a veritable smorgasbord of noodley delights.\"\n\nAlso of note is the Rara Avis in the east wing of the Solís Theatre, a branch of the Uruguayan chain of restaurants called La Pasiva in the Centro area which serves pastas and meat dishes, and the restaurants in the Mercado del Puerto and the Mercado de la Abundancia.\n\nMany of the notable bars in the city are located in the \"barrio\" of Pocitos near the sea. Amongst these pubs of note include the \"Tibet Pub\", \"La Estada\", \"La Vuelta\" and the \"Rosh Bistró Bar\".\n\nMany bars and pubs are located inside community markets. Customers at markets may sit at bars to order sausages, offal, asado, and other meats that are being grilled right in front of them. Meats, especially cheap cuts of beef and pork such as sausages and organs, are a large part of the ordinary diet in Montevideo. The various meats are served with simple side dishes such as crusty bread, tapenades, fried potatoes, and tapas. During lunch, local lager beer is the most common choice of accompaniment, although soft drinks such as colas are widely available. In addition to having bars and pubs, markets in Montevideo also sell fresh produce, mate, coffee, kitchen ware, and other basic consumer goods.\nIn the old area of the city or the immediate surroundings notable pubs include the \"Shannon Irish pub\" and \"Chains Pub\". The Shannon Irish pub in the Old City area of the city was established in 2001. It is located at Bartolomé Mitre 1318, 2 blocks from the Plaza Independencia and 1 block from the Plaza Matriz. Bradt Travel Guides says \"An Irish pub on Montevideo's liveliest pub street, with a wide range of beers (although Uruguayans find it hard to understand why an Irish pub doesn't serve Irish coffee).\" The pub is an important centre for Irish Uruguayans, often featuring live music. The pub serves traditional Irish whiskey by Jameson (1780), Paddy (1779), Powers Gold Label (1791), Bushmills (1608), Redbreast, Ballantine's (1827) and others and mainly sandwiches and fajitas.\nOn the 13th of April 2008, twelve thousand five hundred cooks in Montevideo together grilled of beef Montevideo, setting a new Guinness world record. The event required a grill nearly one mile long and 6 tonnes of charcoal. The barbecue bested the previous record of 8 tonnes, which was set by Mexico in 2006. Montevideo's record held until March 2011, when of beef were grilled in General Pico in Argentina.\n\n"}
{"id": "21899301", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21899301", "title": "Disquotational principle", "text": "Disquotational principle\n\nThe disquotational principle is a philosophical theorem which holds that a rational speaker will accept \"p\" if and only if he or she believes \"p\". The quotes indicate that the statement \"p\" is being treated as a sentence, and not as a proposition. This principle is presupposed by claims that hold that substitution fails in certain intensional contexts.\n\nConsider the following argument:\n\nTo derive (3), we have to assume that when Sally accepts that \"Cicero was a famous orator\", she believes that Cicero was a famous orator. Then we can exchange Cicero for Tully, and derive (3). Bertrand Russell thought that this demonstrated the failure of substitutivity of identicals in intensional contexts.\n\nIn \"A Puzzle about Belief,\" Saul Kripke argues that the application of the disquotational theorem can yield a paradox on its own, without appeal to the substitution principle, and that this may show that the problem lies with the former, and not the latter. There are various formulations of this argument.\n\nSuppose that, Pierre, a Frenchman, comes to believe that (1) \"Londres est jolie\" (London is pretty), without ever having visited the city. Later in life, Pierre ends up living in London. He finds no French speakers there (he does not speak English yet), and everyone refers to the city as \"London,\" not \"Londres\". He finds this city decidedly unattractive, for the neighborhood he decides to live in is decidedly unattractive. Over time, he learns English, and formulates the belief that (2) \"London is not pretty\". Pierre never realizes that London is the English word for \"Londres\". Now with the disquotational principle, we can deduce from (1) that Pierre believes the proposition that \"Londres est jolie\". With a weak principle of translation (e.g., \"a proposition in language A is the same as a semantically identical proposition in language B\" [note that a proposition is not the same as a sentence]), we can now deduce that Pierre believes that London is pretty. But we can also deduce from (2) and the disquotational principle that Pierre believes that London is not pretty. These deductions can be made \"even though Pierre has made no logical blunders in forming his beliefs\". Without the disquotational principle, this contradiction could not be derived, because we would not be able to assume that (1) and (2) meant anything in particular.\n\nThis paradox can also be derived without appeal to another language. Suppose that Pierre assents to the proposition that \"Paderewski had musical talent\", perhaps having heard that this man was a famous pianist. With the disquotational principle, we can deduce that Pierre believes the proposition that Paderewski had musical talent. Now suppose that Pierre overhears a friend discussing the political exploits of a certain statesman, Paderewski, without knowing that the two Paderewskis are the same man. Pierre's background tells him that statesmen are generally not very gifted in music, and this leads him to the belief that Paderewski had no musical talent. The disquotation principle allows us to deduce that Pierre believes the proposition that Paderewski had no musical talent. Using this principle, we have now deduced that Pierre believes that Paderewski had musical talent, and does not believe that Paderewski had musical talent, \"even though Pierre's beliefs were formed logically\".\n\n"}
{"id": "162729", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=162729", "title": "Détournement", "text": "Détournement\n\nA détournement (), meaning \"rerouting, hijacking\" in French, is a technique developed in the 1950s by the Letterist International, and later adapted by the Situationist International (SI), that was defined in the SI's inaugural 1958 journal as \"[t]he integration of present or past artistic productions into a superior construction of a milieu. In this sense there can be no situationist painting or music, but only a situationist use of those means. In a more elementary sense, \"détournement\" within the old cultural spheres is a method of propaganda, a method which reveals the wearing out and loss of importance of those spheres.\" \n\nIt has been defined elsewhere as \"turning expressions of the capitalist system and its media culture against itself\"—as when slogans and logos are turned against their advertisers or the political status quo. \n\nDétournement was prominently used to set up subversive political pranks, an influential tactic called situationist prank that was reprised by the punk movement in the late 1970s and inspired the culture jamming movement in the late 1980s.\n\nIts opposite is recuperation, in which radical ideas or the social image of people who are viewed negatively are twisted, commodified, and absorbed in a more socially acceptable context.\n\nIn general it can be defined as a variation on previous work, in which the newly created work has a meaning that is antagonistic or antithetical to the original. The original media work that is \"détourned\" must be somewhat familiar to the target audience, so that it can appreciate the opposition of the new message. The artist or commentator making the variation can reuse only some of the characteristic elements of the originating work.\n\nDétournement is similar to satirical parody, but employs more direct reuse or faithful mimicry of the original works rather than constructing a new work which merely alludes strongly to the original. It may be contrasted with recuperation, in which originally subversive works and ideas are themselves appropriated by mainstream media.\n\nOne could view détournement as forming the opposite side of the coin to 'recuperation' (where radical ideas and images become safe and commodified), in that images produced by the spectacle get altered and subverted so that rather than supporting the \"status quo\", their meaning becomes changed in order to put across a more radical or oppositional message.\n\nGuy Debord and Gil J Wolman categorized détourned elements into two types: \"minor détournements\" and \"deceptive détournements\". Minor détournements are détournements of elements that in themselves are of no real importance such as a snapshot, a press clipping, an everyday object which draw all their meaning from being placed in a new context. Deceptive détournements are when already significant elements such as a major political or philosophical text, great artwork or work of literature take on new meanings or scope by being placed in a new context.\n\nDétournement is the integration of past or present artistic production into a superior construction of a milieu. In this sense there can be no situationist painting or music, but only a situationist use of these means. In a more primitive sense, détournement with the old cultural spheres is a method of propaganda, a method that testifies to the wearing out and loss of importance of those spheres.\n\nIn the United States, Frank Discussion is widely known for his use of détournement in his works dating from the late 1970s through the present, particularly with the Feederz. The use of détournement by Barbara Kruger familiarised many with the technique, and it was extensively and effectively used as part of the early HIV/AIDS activism of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Examples of contemporary detournement include Adbusters' \"subvertisements\" and other instances of culture jamming, as well as poems composed collaboratively by Marlene Mountain, Paul Conneally, and others, in which quotations from such famous sources as the Ten Commandments and quotations by United States President George W. Bush are combined with haiku-like phrases to produce a larger work intended to subvert the original source. The comic artist Brad Neely's reinterpretation of Harry Potter, \"Wizard People,\" took Warner Brother's first Harry Potter film, \"The Sorcerer's Stone,\" and substituted the original soundtrack with a narration that casts the hero as a Nietzschean superman.\n\nThe concept of détournement has had a popular influence amongst contemporary radicals, and the technique can be seen in action in the present day when looking at the work of Culture Jammers including the Cacophony Society, Billboard Liberation Front, monochrom, Occupy Movements and Adbusters, whose 'subvertisements' 'detourn' Nike adverts, for example. In this case, the original advertisement's imagery is altered in order to draw attention to said company's policy of shifting their production base to cheap-labour third-world 'free trade zones'. However, the line between 'recuperation' and 'détournement' can become thin (or at least very fuzzy) at times, as Naomi Klein points out in her book \"No Logo\". Here she details how corporations such as Nike, Pepsi or Diesel have approached Culture Jammers and Adbusters and offered them lucrative contracts in return for partaking in 'ironic' promotional campaigns. She points out further irony by drawing attention to merchandising produced in order to promote Adbusters' Buy Nothing Day, an example of the recuperation of détournement if ever there was one.\n\nKlein's arguments about irony reifying rather than breaking down power structures are echoed by Slavoj Žižek. Žižek argues that the kind of distance opened up by détournement is the condition of possibility for ideology to operate: by attacking and distancing oneself from the sign-systems of capital, the subject creates a fantasy of transgression that \"covers up\" his/her actual complicity with capitalism as an overarching system. In contrast, scholars are very fond of pointing out the differences between hypergraphics, 'detournement', the postmodern idea of appropriation and the Neoist use of plagiarism as the use of different and similar techniques used for different and similar means, effects and causes.\n\nThe Neue Slowenische Kunst has a long history of aggressive détournement of extreme political ideologies, as do several industrial music groups, such as Die Krupps, Nitzer Ebb, KMFDM, and Front 242.\n\nChris Morris uses détournement and culture jamming extensively in his work, particularly in the British television series \"The Day Today\" and \"Brass Eye\".\n\nThe Istanbul-based platform InEnArt, on the occasion of the 13th Istanbul Biennial 2013, launched a forum titled Urban Voices focusing on phenomena that are turning expressions of the system and its media culture against itself. The authors of InEnArt are regularly publishing different phenomenas of détournement and invite the online community to participate by uploading similar examples.\n\n\n"}

It is based on V. C. Andrews' 1979 novel of the same name.\n\nAt one point Wes Craven was scheduled to direct the film, and he even completed a screenplay draft. Producers were disturbed by his approach to the incest-laden story, however, and Jeffrey Bloom ended up with writing and directing duties.\n\nAfter the sudden death of their father, four children — teenagers Chris and Cathy and 5-year-old twins Cory and Carrie — find themselves penniless and forced to travel with their mother Corrine to live with her wealthy parents (whom the children had neither met nor been told about before). Corrine informs her children that there has been tension between herself and her parents for many years, but does not elaborate and simply says they had cut her out of their lives for something she had done of which they disapproved. The children trust her, though Cathy is skeptical as she wonders what happened that caused the rift between her mother and her parents.\n\nCorrine's mother, Olivia, a religious fanatic, takes her daughter and her children into her home, though with the harsh condition that the children must be sequestered away in a locked room so that her husband Malcolm (who is dying) will never know of their existence. To that end, the children are shut inside one bedroom of the mansion, only with access to the mansion's attic via a secret stairway. It is on their first day there that their grandmother reveals the shocking truth of what caused Corrine to be disowned and stricken from her father's will years ago: Corrine's husband was really her uncle, her father's half-brother, making their love incestuous and their children the product of incest. When Corrine finally returns to the children that night, she is forced to show the children that she had been savagely bullwhipped by her mother as punishment for her marrying her uncle and having children from the union. Corrine confesses to the children that she and their father were niece and uncle, and her parents were livid as they believed Corrine disgraced the family; the children do not say anything but seem to accept it. Corrine tells the children that her parents made it clear that if she had any children by her uncle she would be disinherited, but because her father doesn't know about them she still has a chance to get the money when he passes away. She says that their confinement will only be for a short time: her father is deathly ill, and once she is able to convince him to secure her inheritance, they will be free and they will leave.\n\nThe plot focuses on the children's ordeal as shut-ins and their clashes with the ultra-religious grandmother, who loathes the children due to their incestuous conception. The children struggle to survive, even as their mother's visits quickly taper off. In particular, Olivia becomes obsessed with Chris and Cathy, out of the warped belief that they have become lovers and are repeating the same incestuous acts like Corrine and her uncle did. Discovering them sleeping in the same bed one morning, the grandmother smashes Cathy's ballerina music box, given to her by her deceased father. After Olivia later discovers the two innocently talking while Cathy is bathing, she calls them sinners. Chris manages to chase her out, but Olivia later ambushes Cathy in the bedroom, locks Chris in the closet preceding the attic, and hacks off Cathy's hair with a pair of scissors. She then starves them for a week, and Chris is forced to feed Cory his own blood so he doesn't die of starvation.\n\nAs time goes on, the children are often sick, especially Cory and Carrie. Chris and Cathy manage to secretly remove the hinges from their locked door on a few occasions to sneak out of their room, and discover that their mother has been living a life of luxury as well as dating a young lawyer, Bart Winslow. She does eventually come to visit them again, and they confront her about not visiting them anymore and leaving them to suffer at the hands of their grandmother. Corrine is very defensive and acts insulted, cries that they are cruel to think that she is deliberately neglecting them or enjoying life while they are locked up, then storms out. Shortly after, Cory becomes deathly ill. The children ask Olivia and Corrine to take Cory to the hospital, which they do, but later Corrine returns to inform them Cory has died. The children are devastated, but not long after they discover their pet mouse is found dead after eating part of a cookie Cory didn't finish, arousing suspicion in Chris and he investigates the cookie. Chris researches and discovers that Cory and their mouse were killed via arsenic poisoning, mixed in the sugar on the cookies they are served with breakfast, and they believe it's their grandmother who's been poisoning them. The remaining siblings decide to leave the attic once and for all.\n\nChris sneaks out to steal money before they escape and discovers that their mother is planning to marry Bart Winslow at the mansion the next morning. Though upset, he suggests to Cathy they dress in fancy clothes from the attic, and use the wedding as a cover to sneak out of the house. When Olivia secretly enters their bedroom the next day, hoping to catch them once more doing something \"evil\", Chris takes her by surprise and beats her unconscious with a bedpost. As they are leaving, Cathy, not wanting her mother to get away with what she did to them and leaving them to suffer by their grandmother's hands, tells Chris they need to find their grandfather and tell him the truth so Corrine would lose her inheritance; they had come across him sleeping in his room once before while out and investigating their mother's absence. However, when they enter his room, they find it empty, with the bed dismantled: their grandfather has been dead for months. They also find a copy of his will that was two months old, which reveals a clause that states that if it is ever revealed Corrine had children from her first marriage, even after his death, she will be disinherited and lose all of her money. They realize that Corrine was the one poisoning the cookies, not their grandmother, and their mother was trying to kill them all so no one would know of their existence and secure her inheritance.\n\nThe children crash the wedding ceremony and expose their mother to the guests and the groom; Corrine refuses to acknowledge the children as her own, and Cathy and Chris scold their mother for saying that she would come get them after her father died but breaking the promise when he did pass away, and Chris reveals they found the recent will and told her she knew no one could find out about them or she would lose everything, even after her father's death. Corrine denies it, then Chris shows everyone the dead mouse, proving that she tried killing them all, succeeding with Cory, when the new will was made. Cathy demands to know why her mother did those horrible things to them and offers her mother an arsenic-coated cookie as a wedding present, and in fury tries to force her mother to eat it, chasing her out to a balcony. After a brief struggle, Corrine accidentally falls and dies. Afterward, the children leave the mansion as their grandmother looks on with scorn; the narrator (an older Cathy's voiceover) explains that the children did manage to survive all by themselves, Chris went to medical school and became a doctor, Cathy got a job and started dancing again, although Carrie was \"never truly healthy\". She wonders aloud if her grandmother is still alive, anticipating Cathy's eventual return to claim the family's fortune.\n\nV. C. Andrews herself demanded and, eventually, got script approval when she sold the film rights to producers Thomas Fries and Sy Levin. She turned down five scripts (the violent and graphic screenplay by Wes Craven was rejected by the producers, though), before choosing the script by Jeffrey Bloom, who would also direct. Obviously, Bloom's script was the one that was the closest to the novel, but, as he did not have full control over the matter of the film, the numerous producers and the two studios forcefully made changes in the script, thus stripping from it many plot points and themes of the novel, including the incestuous relationship between the oldest siblings. Bloom said there was a lot of conflict in production but could do nothing to talk the producers out of the many drastic changes made in the script.\n\nOriginally, Bloom wanted David Shire to score the film, but Christopher Young was chosen by the producers instead.\n\nVeteran actresses Louise Fletcher and Victoria Tennant were cast as the Grandmother and Mother, respectively, while the four children were played by newcomers Kristy Swanson, Jeb Stuart Adams, Ben Ryan Ganger, and Lindsay Parker. Swanson once claimed when V.C. Andrews met her, she said Swanson was just like she pictured Cathy.\n\nBeing a fairly low-budget production, Bloom said, big names were not considered for any role in the film. Jeffrey Bloom had a young Sharon Stone audition for the film, but he could not convince the producers to give her the part of Corrine, the mother.\n\nLouise Fletcher wanted to get deep inside her role, so she called Andrews one night to ask about the motivation of her character in the film. She was also so into the part, that she stayed strictly within the character of the Grandmother all the time, even when she wasn't shooting. \"I couldn't let myself think about distractions like what a beautiful day or what are we going to have for lunch?\" she said in an interview.\n\nAndrews was also given a cameo as a maid in Foxworth Hall, scrubbing the glass of a window after Chris and Cathy attempt to escape from the rooftop. Anne Patty, present at the filming of Andrews' scene, said that her part is metaphorical. \"The writer is a person who wipes the window clean so that the reader can clearly see into the lives of the characters\".\n\nBloom claims that, after the filming was completed, the producers approached him to refilm a new ending, and one of the many ideas was that the siblings accidentally kill Corinne during their escape. Bloom tried to talk them out of it and when he was unable to convince them otherwise, he eventually quit. The new ending, partly inspired by the ending of Wes Craven's own screenplay, was eventually filmed by someone else.\n\nCastle Hill, a Tudor Revival mansion in Ipswich, Massachusetts served as Foxworth Hall and was the main location at which nearly all interior and exterior scenes were filmed. The beginning scene shows the children walking towards the front of the house after being dropped off by the bus. In reality the bus stop is at the end of the rolling green where the lawn ends and the ocean begins. The final scene of the film where Cathy pushes her mother Corrine off of the balcony and her bridal veil gets caught in the trellis, strangling her to death, was filmed at Greystone Mansion in Beverly Hills, California.\n\nJeffrey Bloom had no involvement in the final edit of the film, as he had walked off the set, and the new ending was inserted. He also claimed, regarding scenes involving the incest between Chris and Cathy, scenes were indeed cut.\n\nBloom's original early cut of the movie was screened to a test audience in December 1986 in San Fernando Valley and it was met with negative reactions, mostly because of the scenes of incest between Cathy and Chris. The test audience, mostly consisting of female adolescents (the same demographic the book series was targeted towards), reported in test cards that they were revolted by the scenes and another where Corrine disrobes in front of her father to be whipped by her mother. They also disliked the original ending where Louise Fletcher's character tries to kill the children with a butcher knife because they found it to be \"too horrific\".\n\nThe producers insisted on a new ending because they thought that the audience for the film would want to see the children take revenge on Corrine, so an unknown director was brought in to film the new ending where Corrine dies (despite the fact that her character lives in the first three books in the series), but the scene was filmed with Victoria Tennant's stunt double since the actress refused to film the scene (She preferred the original ending to the film.) and walked off set. While rest of the movie was filmed in Massachusetts, new ending was filmed in California. Following severe re-cutting of the film, which was done not just to remove \"sensitive content\" but also to make it shorter to secure more theatrical screenings, as well as the addition of the infamous new ending that writer and director Jeffrey Bloom hated and refused to film, the film was again screened to a test audience in January 1987. This version was met with more positive feedback and was the version that ended up being released in theaters. Due to drastic re-editing, the film was pushed back to November from its original release in March, almost an entire year later after Bloom's original cut was completed and test screened.\n\nOne of the scenes deleted from the final cut of the film was shown in a TV program covering the behind-the-scenes production of the film. It's an extended scene from when Chris and Cathy enter Corrine's bedroom. It shows Cathy going about the room wondering why there are no pictures of Corrine's children or her husband in the room. Another deleted scene was shown being filmed where Corrine and the grandmother confront each other after Cory's death and the grandmother is shown smiling, indicating that she was involved in Cory's funeral.\n\nAccording to Bloom in a 2010 interview, nudity and scenes of incest being cut out wasn't done solely because of negative feedback from test audiences but also because the studio and the producers wanted to secure a lower rating. It got to the point where even the \"small shots and small suggestive stuff\" were cut out to make sure that the film got a PG-13 rating from the MPAA.\n\nKristy Swanson also confirmed in a 2014 interview that there was a test screening which had all scenes of incest included, but when the audience found them to be uncomfortable, they were cut out. Producer Sy Levin also mentioned that one of the cut scenes had Chris watching Cathy through the crack of the door while she was taking off her clothes and getting into a bathtub. Also, test screenings of the film in San Jose and Ohio, after re-editing, were said to include another alternate ending but no further details were reported. According to an LA Times interview (at the time when the movie was released in theaters) with actor Alex Koba who played butler John Hall, just like in Andrews' novel his character also had much bigger role in the original script and also provided a key surprise plot twist. After several rewrites his character was severely reduced and has only one line of dialogue in all the film, \"Good evening Mr. Winthrop\", and the butler had become little more than a gloomy figure in black who wheels a serving cart back and forth across the screen. And the plot twist was gone. Koba also said about different versions of the endings for the movie: \"They had three different endings for that movie, and they picked the worst one, the one you're seeing now.\" In another, earlier article it was also mentioned that Bloom's original intended ending was very similar to the ending of the original book, and it included the children simply walking out of their attic prison into the sunshine during the wedding, to symbolize growing up, Bloom said, with \"the way to freedom clear.\" It is not known whether this version of the ending was included only in Bloom's original script, or whether it actually was filmed and is the second alternate ending that was shown in some test screenings. Despite interest from fans, no uncut version of the film was released, nor was Bloom's original director's cut, and it is not known if the deleted footage still exists.\n\nAccording to Bloom, the original ending went like this:\n\nBriefly, the surviving children interrupt the wedding ceremony and dramatically confront Corrine. All in attendance are horrified by what the children say about how their mother locked them up and poisoned them. The groom is shocked speechless. The grandmother is outraged. The grandfather is there, in his wheelchair, to hear it all. Corrine denies everything, but it doesn't matter; it's too late. The children's story is bolstered by the fact that they look half dead. They leave the wedding, but before leaving the house the grandmother tries to attack them [with a big knife]. They're saved by John Hall, the butler. The grandmother is subdued by him and the children leave.\n\nThe film received mostly negative reviews from critics and fans of the book, who both disliked the film's slow pacing, acting and plot changes. It currently holds a rating of 13% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 8 reviews. Variety commented that \"V.C. Andrews novel of incestuous relationships and confined childhood always has been a superb candidate for a film treatment, but director Jeffrey Bloom has taken narrative and squeezed the life from it. Performances are as stiff and dreary as the attic these children are imprisoned in\". Richard Harrington of The Washington Post said of the time that \"it is slow, stiff, stupid and senseless, a film utterly lacking in motivation, development, and nuance, and further marred by embarrassingly flat acting and directing\". TV Guide rated the film at one out of four stars and mentioned that \"the film version of Andrews' novel is incredibly tame and downright boring\". Time Out London stated that \"as fantasy stripped of all the metaphorical trimmings, the sublimely ridiculous plot is more likely to reduce an audience to laughter than to tears\"\n\nRecent reviews were slightly more mixed; A review published in 2012 on the website Basement Rejects gave the film four and a half stars out of ten and stated that \"\"Flowers in the Attic\" is in the so-bad-its-good category. It teeters on the edge of just bad, but it has a bit of a kitschy feel.\" A March 2018 review for the website Cinemas Fringes on the upcoming Arrow Films Blu-ray release was somewhat more favorable in which it was more critical of the acting, but mentioned that \"\"Flowers in the Attic\" is a film with lots of issues but it's still diverting as a piece of 1980s nostalgia\". The film received a positive review on the Cinematic Addiction website, where it was praised for its acting, direction and music and was said that \"\"Flowers in the Attic\" is a good movie. It's certainly not a film for everyone − it deals with some very disturbing themes − but it is an effective movie\".\n\nThe movie debuted at No. 3.\n\nThe film's reception by fans of the book and critics was mostly negative, but Kristy Swanson won a Young Artist Award in 1989 for her portrayal of Cathy Dollanganger, while in 1988, Louise Fletcher was nominated for a Saturn Award for her performance as the Grandmother.\n\nAccording to Kristy Swanson herself, a sequel to the film adaptation based on the novel's sequel, \"Petals on the Wind\", was planned but eventually it never reached production. Once again, Fries Entertainment was going to be producing the sequel and the script was written by Mark David Perry. The film would be based on the same plotline of the sequel novel, with the exception of the lack of Corinne Foxworth's character since she was killed off in the original film.\n\nKristy Swanson agreed to do the part one more time but she was never contacted again about the film after she was sent the script: \"I was sent a script of \"Petals on the Wind\" and it never took off ... I remember running into Louise Fletcher in Santa Barbara about four years ago. She asked me if I had gotten the \"Petals on the Wind\" script, which I had, and she wanted to know if I had read it. I told her I had and that they had called me about it. I was interested but then I didn't hear from them anymore. And apparently the same thing happened with her. It's like they wanted to do it but they couldn't get it off the ground ... When I read the script, I wasn't too thrilled with it. I know Cathy goes through a lot in the next book, and the script was a real \"sexfest.\" She gets pregnant and has so many affairs. There's her brother, Christopher, and then she has an affair with Julian, the dancer, and there's Paul, the doctor. I was actually kind of wondering if I should even do a sequel, you know? I just didn't know if it should be done.\"\n\nAnother adaptation of \"Flowers in the Attic\" aired on the Lifetime network on January 18, 2014, starring Heather Graham as Corrine, Academy Award-winner Ellen Burstyn as Olivia, and Kiernan Shipka and Mason Dye as Cathy and Christopher. Producer Meredith Finn stated that the remake of the film remained much more true to the book than its predecessor with the controversial incest storyline remaining intact.\n\nA television movie sequel based on the next book of the series, \"Petals on the Wind\", premiered on the Lifetime network on May 26, 2014. Unlike the book, the film jumped ten years ahead from the events of \"Flowers\". It starred Rose McIver as Cathy, Wyatt Nash as Christopher, replacing Kiernan Shipka and Mason Dye from the previous movie, respectively, and Will Kemp as Julian Marquet, with Heather Graham as Corrine and Ellen Burstyn as Olivia Foxworth. Production for the film began on February 25, 2014, in Los Angeles.\n\nIn the United States, \"Flowers in the Attic\" was first released on VHS format. Anchor Bay Entertainment later acquired home distribution rights and released the film on video on October 3, 1997. this was followed by a DVD from Anchor Bay on April 10, 2001 which contained a newly remastered version presented in its original aspect ratio of 1.85:1, the original Mono audio track in Dolby Digital, and, the theatrical trailer. On September 20, 2011, \"Flowers in the Attic\" was made available on DVD via Image Entertainment as part of their \"Midnight Madness Series\". Image Entertainment released the film for the first time on Blu-ray in the U.S. on September 9, 2014.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the film received a VHS release from Cinema Club on January 26, 2000. It was made available on DVD three times, first from Cinema Club on June 7, 2004, then, from Anchor Bay Entertainment on February 21, 2005, and finally, from budget distribution company Boulevard Entertainment. \"Flowers in the Attic\" received its Blu-ray release in the UK on March 12, 2018 via Arrow Films in the most definitive version to date; the special edition set contains the original aspect ratio of 1.85:1, an LCPM 2.0 English audio track, English SDH subtitles, numerous specials, including, cast and crew interviews, audio commentaries, the original ending, original theatrical trailer and more. The set also contains original and newly commissioned cover artwork, and a collectible booklet available only in first printing.\n\n\n"}

He maintains records of people he believes to be \"evil\". He makes phone calls to them and their employers at all hours, writes letters regarding their actions, demands their prompt firing, and threatens to involve higher authorities if they do not comply. Unsatisfied with the results of his anonymous calls and letters, he searches for a more effective way to eliminate evil from the world. He settles on the idea of shrinking all evil people to two feet tall. Throughout the episode, Crangle's parrot Pete periodically calls out \"nut,\" asking for a nut to eat, which Crangle gives him, not realizing that Pete is also, in effect, calling Crangle a \"nut.\"\n\nHis landlady Mrs. Williams arrives, whom he berates and treats horribly to make her leave. Mrs. Lucas also comes to Crangle's apartment and pleads for Crangle to leave her husband, a doctor, alone. Crangle is convinced that because her husband was unable to save the life of a woman in the ER who died from her injuries, that he is a murderer and evil. Due to Crangle's letter writing to the hospital, her husband's colleagues and coworkers abuse him, which Mrs. Lucas wants Crangle to stop. Crangle simply believes that those people are also evil. Mrs. Lucas leaves realizing that Crangle is insane.\n\nCrangle calls a number of government agencies, and Agent Hall of the FBI is sent to investigate. Crangle tells him of his plan to shrink every evil person at 4:00 that afternoon through sheer force of will, also mentioning that he believes all evil people are collaborating in a worldwide conspiracy. He believes that by shrinking all evil people to two feet tall, that they will be unable carry on their everyday lives, and eventually become extinct. Hall asks Crangle if he has ever had any psychiatric help and tells Crangle that they do not need his kind of help because they have the law. Hall says that both support and help in upholding the law are appreciated, but what Crangle is doing is instead interference. Crangle accuses him of being in on the conspiracy. As Hall leaves, Crangle screams at him that he too will be two feet tall in just 20 minutes.\n\nWhen 4:00 rolls around, Crangle is horrified to find that he himself has been shrunk to two feet tall. He struggles in vain to get up to his window sill, and one last time Pete calls out the word \"nut\".\n\nIn the radio adaptation starring Stan Freberg, the ending was altered to be more gruesome as Pete the parrot mistakes the now-shrunken Crangle for a \"nut\".\n\n\n"}

It was first published in the Hindi weekly \"Dharmyug\" in 1983, and in English language translation in the weekly \"Manushi\" in the same year.\n\n\"Girls\" is told from the viewpoint of an eight-year-old girl, and highlights how Indian society takes women for granted and conditions them to accept a secondary role in the family. It also shows that many a times, women themselves are the one's who consider women inferior. In the story, the narrator's father has been shown as a kind man. He wants his daughters to get educated and become something in their lives. The narrator's mother, Lali, has three daughters and is expecting a fourth child, fervently hoping that it is a boy so that she will be rid of the nuisance of going through another pregnancy. Lali, the narrator and her sisters go to Nani's (maternal grandmother's) house for the last months of pregnancy. Throughout the stay there, the narrator notices how the members of the house consider women inferior, and is fed up of the elders' hypocrisy. There occur many incidents that keep remind the narrator of a girl's subjugative position in orthodox Indian society. Only the grandson is allowed to sit on \"Nani's\" lap whereas the girls are sent away. Nani and all the elders of the house pray to the family goddess that the baby born be a son so as to uphold the 'family honor'. The narrator overhears her aunt complaining in whispers to her mother of the problems she has to endure as a woman. Such incidents leave a lasting impact on the already insecure mind of the narrator, who is curious to know why the elders consider women and girls to be inferior. Her innocent curiosity greatly angers Lali, Nani and the others. Lakshmi, the narrator's elder sister, advises her not to ask the elders such questions.\nThen comes the holy day when \"kanyakumaris\" or young girls are to be worshipped as goddesses. Nani, who earlier shows herself to be a woman who agrees that women are inferior, now calls her granddaughters lovingly to partake of the prasad and participate in the rituals. The elders' hypocrisy shocks the narrator and is too much for her to bear. She bursts into tears, shouting angrily that if they did not love girls, why did they pretend to worship them?\nTo know more read the book\"Treasure Trove of short stories\".\n"}

In its day, it was the largest international event to be held in Ireland. The Irish Industrial Exhibition Building, located on the grounds of Leinster House, housed the entire fair. It lasted from the 12 May to 31 October, Queen Victoria accompanied by the Prince Consort and the Prince of Wales, paid an official visit on 29 August.\n\nIt was entirely funded by William Dargan, entrepreneur and developer of Irish railways. He had planned to donate $100,000 to the effort, but ended up giving $400,000. The intent of the exhibition was to introduce the industrial revolution to Ireland, which was behind some other European countries.\n\nVisitors were struck with the richness and splendor of the building more than by any of the objects that it contained. Critics described the large exhibition building and \"the rapidity with which it was erected\" (a few months), and \"the sufficiency of its plans, and the enormous mass of its carefully worked materials.\" The building is described by The Illustrated Dublin Exhibition Catalogue as:\n\nOn 12 May 1853, when the exhibition opened, the architect (who had also been the architect for the industrial exhibition held in Cork the previous year), John Benson, was granted a knighthood. Part of the roof blew off during a storm on Christmas Eve, the year before opening.\n\nSome limited Irish furniture industry was shown, including the linen and lace industry which the Irish could identify with. Also Bog wood carvings and Celtic Revival jewellery and other items were showcased, including the Tara Brooch, displayed with the modern imitations which were already fashionable. However none of this inspired new Irish Industry.\n\nThere were a few American exhibits including Colt and Singer. Colt sold 40 pistols to the Irish prison system.\n\nThere were also some exhibits from Australia, including examples of gold from several fields.\n\nIt was the first Worlds Fair to exhibit fine arts paintings. Included in the fine arts section were the calotype photographs which had been taken by Edward King-Tenison, of Castle Tenison, Co. Roscommon of the villages and towns of Spain. E.K. Tenison had developed a technique which enabled him to enlarge his pictures to a size which were appropriate for exhibition.\n\nBritish exhibits were limited to those companies who were looking for markets in Ireland, with little success. It was only during its last month that Dargan convinced the railways to offer a very inexpensive excursions rate and combined with an admission ticket for almost nothing, did some of the general Irish public get to see the crystal palace in Dublin.\n\nThe Illustrated Dublin Exhibition Catalogue commented;\nHowever, overall attendance was lower than expected at approximately 1.15 million visitors, leaving Dargan with a financial loss of approximately £9,000. This has been attributed to the fact the common Irish country person could not identify with much of the technology of the time. It was also overshadowed by the exhibitions held in New York (Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations) and London the same year.\n\n"}

Film is banned in Australia and Germany.\n\nUnable to bring in anymore money for Leroy, her abusive pimp, the pregnant Rose tries to run away in the middle of the night, but is caught by Leroy. Using a clothes hanger, Leroy performs an impromptu abortion on Rose, unintentionally killing her in the process. Leroy disposes of Rose's baby in a dumpster, where its cries attract the attention of a homeless man, who raises the disfigured child as \"Hanger\".\n\nOn his eighteenth birthday, the vagrant sends Hanger off to live with John, his biological father, who the man had earlier met at a junkyard. John informs Hanger that he has gotten him a job at the junkyard, and that he will be working there and living with Russell, an acquaintance with Down syndrome. As he drives away with Hanger, John runs over the homeless man (who was defecating in his tent) and joyously tells his long-lost son \"Welcome to the rest of your life!\" John gives Hanger a picture of Rose, and picks up a prostitute for him to have sex with, but upon seeing Hanger's mutilated face, the woman goes into hysterics, so John crushes her head in his truck door.\n\nWhile Hanger is watching pornography with Russell in their home, a Jehovah's Witness visits, and Hanger mauls and partially eats her while being cheered on by Russell. Later, John drops by, and reveals to Hanger that he has a plan to get revenge on Leroy for what he did to Rose. On his way out, John is approached by Foxy White, Leroy's girlfriend, who offers to help John kill Leroy. John turns down Foxy's offer, but says he will make Leroy suffer \"a little extra\" if Foxy watches over Hanger.\n\nWhile Hanger is at work, John is captured by Leroy and a prostitute named Trashy, who disfigure him with a blow torch, and a hanger. Foxy finds John and tries to release him, but Leroy walks in on this, and shoots Foxy in the head. As that occurs, Russell and Hanger are drugged by Phil, a co-worker, who rapes them while wearing a Santa suit; at one point, Phil inserts his penis into Hanger's leaking colostomy. Russell and Hanger get their revenge on Phil at the junkyard, knocking him out, and placing him under a pile of garbage. Russell goes home and drinks tea made from used tampons, but after getting a call from Hanger, Russell goes to the junkyard, and finds Nicole (the owner's daughter) unconscious in her office, Hanger having knocked her out with Phil's drugs.\n\nRussell takes Nicole's tampon, and she is later found by Leroy, who rapes her while she is unconscious, and threatens her into luring away Russell so Leroy can be alone with Hanger. Once he is in Nicole's office, Russell is seemingly killed by Leroy, who chokes him with one of Nicole's tampons. Outside, Hanger stomps Phil's head in, and is confronted by Leroy, but John (who was left for dead, but recovered and killed Trashy by shoving a douche up her nose) appears and calls Leroy out. Leroy and John fatally shoot each other, and a distraught Hanger runs off with the hysterical Nicole.\n\n\"Hanger\" was released Direct-to-Video by Breaking Glass Pictures on Nov 17, 2009.\n\nFilm Bizarro found \"Hanger\" to be \"a great entertaining trash-fest that has come the closest to being a true throwback to grindhouse cinema that any movie has so far\" despite the ending feeling erratic and anticlimactic. A three and a half was awarded by Severed Cinema, which wrote that \"\"Hanger\" is as entertaining as it is repulsive\" and \"the film is a fun campy horror comedy\". Independent Flicks commended the camerawork, editing, gore, and Dan Ellis's performance, but gave a four and half out of seven after deeming the film \"a bit too bizarre\" and \"something of a let down\" due to the \"cartoonish style\" that lessened its impact. \n\nA three out of five was awarded by Digital Retribution, which stated \"\"Hanger\" is hard to rate because it sets out to offend and will probably do so for virtually everyone, but that doesn't make it good\" and \"I found \"Hanger's\" padding and surrealism distracting and a bit boring\". The film was called \"Nicholson's nastiest piece of work yet\" by The Worldwide Celluloid Massacre, which deemed it \"worthless\" and one of the most \"vile\" films the website has covered. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "40781027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40781027", "title": "Lenong", "text": "Lenong\n\nLenong is a traditional theatrical form of the Betawi people in Jakarta, Indonesia.\n\n\"Lenong\" is a form of theatre traditional to the Betawi people of Jakarta, Indonesia. Dialogue is generally in the Betawi dialect. Actions and dialogue are often presented in a humorous manner on top of a stage known as a \"pentas tapal kuda\", so named for the way actors enter the stage from the left and right. Audiences sit in front of the stage. The number of performers is determined by the needs of the story. Male performers are referred to as \"panjak\", while female performers are known as \"ronggeng\". Performers are generally poorly educated.\n\nA performance is generally opened with a prayer, known as \"ungkup\", and a ritual offering. The performers are then introduced. \"Gambang kromong\" is one of the musical genres which may accompany a performance. Musicians may use various instruments, including flutes, gongs, accordions, or drums. The songs are traditionally quite formulaic, and several songs are common in performances, including \"Cente Manis\" and \"Jali-Jali\". Chinese musical influences can be seen.\n\nPerformances can be classified under many genres, although most are about heroes or criminals; tales adapted from folklore, such as from the \"One Thousand and One Nights\", are also common. In broad strokes there are two main subdivisions of \"lenong\", namely \"lenong denes\" and \"lenong preman\". Stories in \"lenong denes\" focus on the exploits of the nobility, the rich, and the powerful. \"Lenong preman\" stories are always about commoners or folk heroes. The type of performance will affect the costumes worn. Stories are not memorised from a script. Rather, performers will memorise an orally-presented outline and follow that, with improvisation as necessary.\n\n\"Lenong\" developed from the earlier form \"Gambang Rancag\". In its earlier years, beginning around the turn of the twentieth century, it was promoted by ethnic Chinese. This has left fairly extensive Chinese influences in the genre.\n\n\"Lenong\" performances from the 1920s and 1930s often focused on the exploits of bandits, including Si Pitung and Si Tjonat. These bandits, though portrayed as despicable people by Dutch and ethnic Chinese writers, became more Robin Hood-like in \"lenong\"; Si Pitung, for instance, became a humble person, a good Muslim, a hero of Betawi people, and an upholder of justice.\n\nDuring the 1950s, Sudiro, the governor of Jakarta, restricted performances of traditional theatre such as \"lenong\". Meanwhile, the booming domestic film industry meant that \"lenong\" performances could not compete on the market. Troupes had to go from \"kampung\" to \"kampung\", offering performances for money which, ultimately, was not always enough to survive on. By the early 1960s \"lenong\" was nearly extinct.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Governor Ali Sadikin gave greater freedom to traditional culture. In this atmosphere, cultural critic and film director D. Djajakusuma worked to promote and preserve \"lenong\", with regular performances at Taman Ismail Marzuki; as a result, S. M. Ardan considers him as having saved the genre. Many \"lenong\" actors, including Benyamin Sueb, Madra, and Enung Tile bin Bayan, began making films in the 1970s.\n\n\"Lenong\" has been televised before. In the early 1990s, Harry de Fretes combined \"lenong\" and sitcoms to create \"Lenong Rumpi\" (literally \"Gossip Lenong\"), which was broadcast on RCTI from 1991 to 1992. Unlike stage performances, performers on this televised \"lenong\" were mostly not native Betawi speakers.\n\n"}

As a founding work of modern Western literature, it regularly appears high on lists of the greatest works of fiction ever published. It has been the inspiration for a wide array of cultural adaptations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Don Quixote\" has inspired many illustrators, painters and sculptors, including Gustave Doré, Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dalí and Antonio de la Gandara. The French artist Honoré Daumier produced 29 paintings and 49 drawings based on the book and characters of Don Quixote, starting with an exhibition at the 1850 Paris Salon, which would later inspire Pablo Picasso. In 1863, Gustave Doré produced a large set of drawings based on \"Don Quixote\". On 10 August 1955, Pablo Picasso drew an illustration of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza for the journal weekly \"Les Lettres françaises\" (week of 18–24 August 1955), which quoted from the Daumier caricature of a century before.

The term is used in Portuguese-speaking countries, and its use in English is rare. The opposite concept is lusophilia.\n\nIn the 19th century, the term \"lusofobia\" was often used to describe nationalist sentiments in Brazil, a former colony of the Portuguese Empire, with Liberal politicians in Rio de Janeiro and Pernambuco advocating the reduction of immigrant Portuguese involvement in the Brazilian economy, though almost all were themselves of Portuguese descent.\nIn Rio, the \"Jacobinos\", a small national radical group, were the strongest opponents of the \"galegos\", the Portuguese immigrants, who were (and still are) also the biggest ethnocultural community in Brazil.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the abdication of Pedro I of Brazil in 1831, in favor of his son Pedro II of Brazil, the poor black people, including slaves, staged anti-Portuguese riots in the streets of Brazil's larger cities.\n\nIn 2007 after three-year-old Madeleine McCann disappeared from Praia da Luz, in the Algarve region of southern Portugal, many UK media outlets wrote highly critical articles that were described as having \"a touch of arrogant xenophobia\". Whilst others in the media attempted to foster anti-Portuguese sentiment with ideas such as boycotting Portugal as a holiday destination, this was not reflected in general public opinion which saw record numbers of UK tourists visit Portugal. Considered a record, the estimates were of 2 million British tourists holidaying in Portugal in 2007. Notable anti-Portuguese articles by Tony Parsons received a record number of complaints to the Press Complaints Commission for that year.\n"}

{"id": "1279493", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1279493", "title": "Mississippian culture", "text": "Mississippian culture\n\nThe Mississippian culture was a mound-building Native American civilization archeologists date from approximately 800 CE to 1600 CE, varying regionally.\nIt was composed of a series of urban settlements and satellite villages (suburbs) linked together by a loose trading network, the largest city being Cahokia, believed to be a major religious center. The civilization flourished from the southern shores of the Great Lakes at Western New York and Western Pennsylvania in what is now the Eastern Midwest, extending south-southwest into the lower Mississippi Valley and wrapping easterly around the southern foot of the Appalachians barrier range into what is now the Southeastern United States.\n\nThe Mississippian way of life began to develop in the Mississippi River Valley (for which it is named). Cultures in the tributary Tennessee River Valley may have also begun to develop Mississippian characteristics at this point. Almost all dated Mississippian sites predate 1539–1540 (when Hernando de Soto explored the area), with notable exceptions being Natchez communities that maintained Mississippian cultural practices into the 18th century.\n\nA number of cultural traits are recognized as being characteristic of the Mississippians. Although not all Mississippian peoples practiced all of the following activities, they were distinct from their ancestors in adoption of some or all of these traits.\n\nThe Mississippians had no writing system or stone architecture. They worked naturally occurring metal deposits, such as hammering and annealing copper for ritual objects like Mississippian copper plates and other decorations, but did not smelt iron or practice bronze metallurgy.\n\nThe Mississippi stage is usually divided into three or more chronological periods. Each period is an arbitrary historical distinction varying regionally. At a particular site, each period may be considered to begin earlier or later, depending on the speed of adoption or development of given Mississippian traits. The \"Mississippi period\" should not be confused with the \"Mississippian culture\". The Mississippi period is the chronological stage, while Mississippian culture refers to the cultural similarities that characterize this society.\n\n\nThe term \"Middle Mississippian\" is also used to describe the core of the classic Mississippian culture area. This area covers the central Mississippi River Valley, the lower Ohio River Valley, and most of the Mid-South area, including western and central Kentucky, western Tennessee, and northern Alabama and Mississippi. Sites in this area often contain large ceremonial platform mounds, residential complexes and are often encircled by earthen ditches and ramparts or palisades.\n\nMiddle Mississippian cultures, especially the Cahokia polity located near East St. Louis, Illinois, was very influential on neighboring societies. High status artifacts, including stone statuary and elite pottery associated with Cahokia, have been found far outside of the Middle Mississippian area. These items, especially the pottery, were also copied by local artists.\n\n\nThe term \"South Appalachian Province\" was originally used by W. H. Holmes in 1903 to describe a regional ceramic style in the southeast involving surface decorations applied with a carved wooden paddle. By the late 1960s archaeological investigations had shown the similarity of the culture that produced the pottery and the midwestern \"Mississippian pattern\" defined in 1937 by the Midwestern Taxonomic System. \n\nIn 1967 James B. Griffin coined 'South Appalachian Mississippian' to describe the evolving understanding of the peoples of the Southeast. South Appalachian Mississippian area sites are distributed across a contiguous area including Alabama, Georgia, northern Florida, South Carolina, central and western North Carolina, and Tennessee. Chronologically this area became influenced by Mississippian culture later than the Middle Mississippian area (about 1000 CE as compared to 800 CE) to its northwest. It is believed that the peoples of this area adopted Mississippian traits from their northwestern neighbors.\n\nTypical settlements were located on riverine floodplains and included villages with defensive palisades enclosing platform mounds and residential areas. Etowah, Ocmulgee, and Moundville are prominent examples of the South Appalachian Mississippian settlements.\n\nThe Caddoan Mississippian area, a regional variant of the Mississippian culture, covered a large territory, including what is now eastern Oklahoma, western Arkansas, northeastern Texas, and northwestern Louisiana. Archaeological evidence has led to a scholarly consensus that the cultural continuity is unbroken from prehistory to the present, and that the Caddo and related Caddo language speakers in prehistoric times and at first European contact are the direct ancestors of the modern Caddo Nation of Oklahoma.\n\nThe climate in this area was drier than areas in the eastern woodlands, hindering maize production, and the lower population on the plains to the west may have meant fewer neighboring competing chiefdoms to contend with. Major sites such as Spiro and the Battle Mound Site are in the Arkansas River and Red River Valleys, the largest and most fertile of the waterways in the Caddoan region, where maize agriculture would have been the most productive. The sites generally lacked wooden palisade fortifications often found in the major Middle Mississippian towns. Living on the western edge of the Mississippian world, the Caddoans may have faced fewer military threats from their neighbors. Their societies may also have had a somewhat lower level of social stratification.\n\nThe Caddoan people were speakers of one of the many Caddoan languages. The Caddoan languages once had a broad geographic distribution, but many are now extinct. The modern languages in the Caddoan family include Caddo and Pawnee, now spoken mainly by elderly people.\n\nHernando de Soto led an expedition into the area in the early 1540s, he encountered several native groups now thought to have been Caddoan. Composed of many tribes, the Caddo were organized into three confederacies, the Hasinai, Kadohadacho, and Natchitoches, which were all linked by their similar languages.\n\nThe Plaquemine culture was an archaeological culture in the lower Mississippi River Valley in western Mississippi and eastern Louisiana. Good examples of this culture are the Medora Site (the type site for the culture and period) in West Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, and the Anna, Emerald Mound, Winterville and Holly Bluff sites located in Mississippi. Plaquemine culture was contemporaneous with the Middle Mississippian culture at the Cahokia site near St. Louis, Missouri. It is considered ancestral to the Natchez and Taensa Peoples.\n\nAlthough the Mississippian culture was heavily disrupted before a complete understanding of the political landscape was written down, many Mississippian political bodies were documented and others have been discovered by research.\n\nMississippian peoples were almost certainly ancestral to the majority of the American Indian nations living in this region in the historic era. The historic and modern day American Indian nations believed to have descended from the overarching Mississippian Culture include: the Alabama, Apalachee, Caddo, Chickasaw, Catawba, Choctaw, Muscogee Creek, Guale, Hitchiti, Houma, Kansa, Missouria, Mobilian, Natchez, Osage, Quapaw, Seminole, Tunica-Biloxi, Yamasee, and Yuchi.\n\nScholars have studied the records of Hernando de Soto's expedition of 1539–1543 to learn of his contacts with Mississippians, as he traveled through their villages of the Southeast. He visited many villages, in some cases staying for a month or longer. The list of sites and peoples visited by the Hernando de Soto Expedition chronicles those villages. Some encounters were violent, while others were relatively peaceable. In some cases, de Soto seems to have been used as a tool or ally in long-standing native feuds. In one example, de Soto negotiated a truce between the Pacaha and the Casqui.\n\nDe Soto's later encounters left about half of the Spaniards and perhaps many hundreds of Native Americans dead. The chronicles of de Soto are among the first documents written about Mississippian peoples, and are an invaluable source of information on their cultural practices. The chronicles of the Narváez expedition were written before the de Soto expedition; the Narváez expedition informed the Court of de Soto about the New World.\n\nAfter the destruction and flight of the de Soto expedition, the Mississippian peoples continued their way of life with little direct European influence. Indirectly, however, European introductions dramatically changed native societies in the Eastern United States. Because the natives lacked immunity to new infectious diseases, such as measles and smallpox, epidemics caused so many fatalities that they undermined the social order of many chiefdoms. Some groups adopted European horses and changed to nomadism. Political structures collapsed in many places.\n\nAt Joara, near Morganton, North Carolina, Native Americans of the Mississippian culture interacted with Spanish colonizers of the Juan Pardo expedition, who built a base there in 1567 called Fort San Juan. Expedition documentation and archaeological evidence of the fort and Native American culture both exist. The soldiers were at the fort about 18 months (1567–1568) before the natives killed them and destroyed the fort. (They killed soldiers stationed at five other forts as well; only one man of 120 survived.) Sixteenth-century Spanish artifacts have been recovered from the site, marking the first European colonization in the interior of what became the United States.\n\nBy the time more documentary accounts were being written, the Mississippian way of life had changed irrevocably. Some groups maintained an oral tradition link to their mound-building past, such as the late 19th-century Cherokee. Other Native American groups, having migrated many hundreds of miles and lost their elders to diseases, did not know their ancestors had built the mounds dotting the landscape. This contributed to the myth of the Mound Builders as a people distinct from Native Americans, which was rigorously debunked by Cyrus Thomas in 1894.\n\n\n\n"}

Once the \"mizuage\" patron's function (of deflowering the young maiko) was served, he was to have no further relations with the girl.\n\nThe money acquired for a \"maiko’s\" \"mizuage\" was a great sum and it was used to promote her debut as a \"geisha\".\n\nMineko Iwasaki, a \"geisha\" that Arthur Golden met while writing \"Memoirs of a Geisha\" described her experience of \"mizuage\" in her autobiography as being an initiation party, symbolized on the geisha-to-be by a change in hairstyle rather than the loss of virginity. Iwasaki describes it as a celebration of the passage of girl (maiko) to woman (geisha), and associated it with the Erikae (turning the collar) ceremony when a maiko graduates to dressing as a geisha.\n\nIn Autobiography of a Geisha, Sayo Masuda describes her experiences of mizuage as sexual exploitation. Writing in 1956, she explained that she was sold multiple times by her okiya to men for mizuage, in the pretence that she had not yet undergone it, to make them a larger profit. The transaction was explicitly a sexual arrangement. However, as a writer Masuda argued against the outlawing of prostitution in Japan, explaining it could be a valuable way for women to make an independent living and would merely be driven underground.\n\nAfter having finished the mizuage, the Kyoto's \"maiko\" changed their hairstyle from a girl's bun to a mature entertainer's hairstyle. Over time various hair styles such as the girl's bun and the sakko have signified the transition of a \"maiko\" to a \"geisha\". In present day, the ritual of mizuage and the changing of hair occurs without sex. Additionally the transitioning of a \"maiko\" to a \"geisha\" is no longer associated with de-flowering.\n\nArthur Golden's novel \"Memoirs of a Geisha\" portrays the \"mizuage\" as a financial arrangement in which a girl's virginity is sold to a \"\"mizuage\" patron\", generally someone who particularly enjoys sex with virgin girls, or merely enjoys the charms of some individual maiko.\n\n"}

{"id": "336573", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=336573", "title": "Phrygian cap", "text": "Phrygian cap\n\nThe Phrygian cap or liberty cap is a soft conical cap with the top pulled forward, associated in antiquity with several peoples in Eastern Europe and Anatolia, including Phrygia, Dacia, and the Balkans. In early modern Europe it came to signify freedom and the pursuit of liberty through a confusion with the \"pileus\", the felt cap of manumitted (emancipated) slaves of ancient Rome. In artistic representations it signifies freedom and the pursuit of liberty.\n\nIt is used in the coat of arms of certain Republics or of republican State institutions in the place where otherwise a Crown would be used (in the heraldry of monarchies). It thus came to be identified as a symbol of the republican form of government. A number of national personifications, in particular France's Marianne, are commonly depicted wearing the Phrygian cap.\n\nBy the 4th century BC (early Hellenistic period) the Phrygian cap was associated with Phrygian Attis, the consort of Cybele, the cult of which had by then become graecified. At around the same time, the cap appears in depictions of the legendary king Midas and other Phrygians in Greek vase-paintings and sculpture. Such images predate the earliest surviving literary references to the cap.\n\nBy extension, the Phrygian cap came to be applied to several other non-Greek-speaking peoples (\"barbarians\" in the classical sense) as well. Most notable of these extended senses of \"Phrygian\" were the Trojans and other western Anatolian peoples, who in Greek perception were synonymous with the Phrygians, and whose heroes Paris, Aeneas, and Ganymede were all regularly depicted with a Phrygian cap. Other Greek earthenware of antiquity also depict Amazons and so-called \"Scythian\" archers with Phrygian caps. Although these are military depictions, the headgear is distinguished from \"Phrygian helmets\" by long ear flaps, and the figures are also identified as \"barbarians\" by their trousers. The headgear also appears in 2nd-century BC Boeotian Tanagra figurines of an effeminate Eros, and in various 1st-century BC statuary of the Commagene, in eastern Anatolia. Greek representations of Thracians also regularly appear with Phrygian caps, most notably Bendis, the Thracian goddess of the moon and the hunt, and Orpheus, a legendary Thracian poet and musician.\n\nWhile the Phrygian cap was of wool or soft leather, in pre-Hellenistic times the Greeks had already developed a military helmet that had a similarly characteristic flipped-over tip. These so-called \"Phrygian helmets\" (named in modern times after the cap) were usually of bronze and in prominent use in Thrace, Dacia, Magna Graecia and the rest of the Hellenistic world from the 5th century BC up to Roman times. Due to their superficial similarity, the cap and helmet are often difficult to distinguish in Greek art (especially in black-figure or red-figure earthenware) unless the headgear is identified as a soft flexible cap by long earflaps or a long neck flap. Also confusingly similar are the depictions of the helmets used by cavalry and light infantry (\"cf.\" Peltasts of Thrace and Paeonia), whose headgear – aside from the traditional \"alopekis\" caps of fox skin – also included stiff leather helmets in imitation of the bronze ones.\n\nThe Greek concept passed to the Romans in its extended sense, and thus encompassed not only to Phrygians or Trojans (which the Romans also generally associated with the term \"Phrygian\"), but also the other near-neighbours of the Greeks. On Trajan's Column, which commemorated Trajan's epic wars with the Dacians (101–102 and 105–106 AD), the Phrygian cap adorns the heads of Trajan's Dacian prisoners. Parthians appear with Phrygian caps in the 2nd-century Arch of Septimius Severus, which commemorates Roman victories over the Parthian Empire. Likewise with Phrygians caps, but for Gauls, appear in 2nd-century friezes built into the 4th century Arch of Constantine.\n\nThe Phrygian cap reappears in figures related to the first to fourth century religion Mithraism. This astrology-centric Roman mystery cult (\"cultus\") projected itself with pseudo-Oriental trappings (known as \"perserie\" in scholarship) in order to distinguish itself from both traditional Roman religion and from the other mystery cults. In the artwork of the cult (e.g. in the so-called \"tauroctony\" cult images), the figures of the god Mithras as well as those of his helpers Cautes and Cautopates are routinely depicted with a Phrygian cap. The function of the Phrygian cap in the cult are unknown, but it is conventionally identified as an accessory of its \"perserie\".\n\nEarly Christian art (and continuing well into the Middle Ages) build on the same Greco-Roman perceptions of (Pseudo-)Zoroaster and his \"Magi\" as experts in the arts of astrology and magic, and routinely depict the \"three wise men\" (that follow a \"star\") with Phrygian caps.\n\nIn late Republican Rome, a soft felt cap called the \"pileus\" served as a symbol of freemen (i.e. non-slaves), and was symbolically given to slaves upon manumission, thereby granting them not only their personal liberty, but also \"libertas\"— freedom as citizens, with the right to vote (if male). Following the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC, Brutus and his co-conspirators instrumentalized this symbolism of the \"pileus\" to signify the end of Caesar's dictatorship and a return to the (Roman) republican system.\n\nThese Roman associations of the \"pileus\" with liberty and republicanism were carried forward to the 18th-century, when the pileus was confused with the Phrygian cap, with the Phrygian cap then becoming a symbol of those values.\n\nIn 1675, the anti-tax and anti-nobility Stamp-Paper revolt erupted in Brittany and north-western France, where it became known as the \"bonnets rouges\" uprising after the blue or red caps worn by the insurgents. Although the insurgents are not known to have preferred any particular style of cap, the name and color stuck as a symbol of revolt against the nobility and establishment. Robespierre would later object to the color, but was ignored.\n\nThe use of a Phrygian-style cap as a symbol of revolutionary France is first documented in May 1790, at a festival in Troyes adorning a statue representing the nation, and at Lyon, on a lance carried by the goddess Libertas. To this day the national allegory of France, Marianne, is shown wearing a red Phrygian cap.\n\nBy wearing the \"bonnet rouge\" and \"sans-culottes\" (\"without silk breeches\"), the Parisian working class made their revolutionary ardor and plebeian solidarity immediately recognizable. By mid-1791, these mocking fashion statements included the \"bonnet rouge\" as Parisian hairstyle, proclaimed by the Marquis de Villette (12 July 1791) as \"the civic crown of the free man and French regeneration.\" On 15 July 1792, seeking to suppress the frivolity, François Christophe Kellermann, 1st Duc de Valmy, published an essay in which the Duke sought to establish the \"bonnet rouge\" as a sacred symbol that could only be worn by those with merit. The symbolic hairstyle became a rallying point and a way to mock the elaborate wigs of the aristocrats and the red caps of the bishops. On 6 November 1793, the Paris city council declared it the official hairstyle of all its members.\n\nThe \"bonnet rouge\" on a spear was proposed as a component of the national seal on 22 September 1792 during the third session of the National Convention. Following a suggestion by Gaan Coulon, the Convention decreed that convicts would not be permitted to wear the red cap, as it was consecrated as the badge of citizenship and freedom. In 1792, when Louis XVI was induced to sign a constitution, popular prints of the king were doctored to show him wearing the \"bonnet rouge\". The bust of Voltaire was crowned with the red bonnet of liberty after a performance of his \"Brutus\" at the Comédie-Française in March 1792.\n\nDuring the period of the Reign of Terror (September 1793 – July 1794), the cap was adopted defensively even by those who might be denounced as moderates or aristocrats and were especially keen to advertise their adherence to the new regime. The caps were often knitted by women known as \"tricoteuses\", who sat beside the guillotine during public executions in Paris and supposedly continued knitting in between executions. The spire of Strasbourg Cathedral was crowned with a \"bonnet rouge\" in order to prevent it from being torn down in 1794.\n\nIn 1814, the \"Acte de déchéance de l'Empereur\" decision formally deposed the Bonapartes and restored the Bourbon regime, who in turn proscribed the \"bonnet rouge\", \"La Marseillaise\" and Bastille Day celebrations. The symbols reappeared briefly in March–July 1815 during \"Napoleon's Hundred Days\", but were immediately suppressed again following the second restoration of Louis XVIII on 8 July 1815.\n\nThe symbols resurfaced again during the July Revolution of 1830, after which they were reinstated by the liberal July Monarchy of Louis Philippe I, and the revolutionary symbolsanthem, holiday, and \"bonnet rouge\"became \"constituent parts of a national heritage consecrated by the state and embraced by the public.\"\n\nThe republican associations with the \"bonnet rouge\" were adopted as the of a French satirical republican and anarchist periodical published between 1913 and 1922 by Miguel Almereyda that targeted the Action française, a royalist, counter-revolutionary movement on the extreme right.\n\nThe anti-tax associations with the \"bonnet rouge\" were revived in October 2013, when a French tax-protest movement called the \"Bonnets Rouges\" used the red revolution-era Phrygian cap as a protest symbol. By means of large demonstrations and direct action, which included the destruction of many highway tax portals, the movement successfully forced the French government to rescind the tax.\n\nIn the 18th century, the cap was often used in English political prints as an attribute of Liberty. In the years just prior to the American Revolutionary War of independence from Great Britain, Americans copied or emulated some of those prints in an attempt to visually defend their inherited liberties as Englishmen. Later, the symbol of republicanism and anti-monarchial sentiment appeared in the United States as headgear of Columbia, who in turn was visualized as a goddess-like female national personification of the United States and of Liberty herself. The cap reappears in association with Columbia in the early years of the republic, for example, on the obverse of the 1785 \"Immune Columbia\" pattern coin, which shows the goddess with a helmet seated on a globe holding in a right hand a furled U.S. flag topped by the liberty cap.\n\nStarting in 1793, U.S. coinage frequently showed Columbia/Liberty wearing the cap. The anti-federalist movement likewise instrumentalized the figure, as in a cartoon from 1796 in which Columbia is overwhelmed by a huge American eagle holding a Liberty Pole under its wings. The cap's last appearance on circulating coinage was the Walking Liberty Half Dollar, which was minted through 1947 (and reused on the current bullion American Silver Eagle).\n\nThe U.S. Army has, since 1778, utilized a \"War Office Seal\" in which the motto \"This We'll Defend\" is displayed directly over a Phrygian cap on an upturned sword. It also appears on the state flags of West Virginia (as part of its official seal), New Jersey, and New York, as well as the official seal of the United States Senate, the state of Iowa, the state of North Carolina (as well as the arms of its Senate,) and on the reverse side of the Seal of Virginia.\n\nIn 1854, when sculptor Thomas Crawford was preparing models for sculpture for the United States Capitol, Secretary of War Jefferson Davis (a slaveowner and later the President of the Confederate States) insisted that a Phrygian cap not be included on a \"Statue of Freedom\", on the grounds that \"American liberty is original and not the liberty of the freed slave\". The cap was not included in the final bronze version that is now in the building.\n\nMany of the anti-colonial revolutions in Latin America were heavily inspired by the imagery and slogans of the American and French Revolutions. As a result, the cap has appeared on the coats of arms of many Latin American nations. The coat of arms of Haiti includes a Phrygian cap to commemorate that country's foundation by rebellious slaves.\n\nThe cap had also been displayed on certain Mexican coins (most notably the old 8-reales coin) through the late 19th century into the mid-20th century. Today, it is featured on the coats of arms or national flags of Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Cuba, El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua and Paraguay.\n\nThe Phrygian cap in Latin American coats of arms\n\n"}

The hoard is the oldest and only coin hoard found on the archipelago.\n\nThe coin hoard from Sandur is interesting not only due to the age of the coins, but also due to their origin, because it indicates with which countries the Faroers already traded in the 11th century. It is generally assumed the Viking age ended on the Faroe Islands in 1035. In the following time period, the Faroe Islands came increasingly under the influence of Norway, which then led to the actual monetary system of the Faroe Islands.\n\nToday the coins are located at the National Museum of the Faroe Islands () in Tórshavn and are among the main attractions there.\n\nThe coins were found in 1863 purely by accident. Gravediggers were digging a grave in the cemetery of Sandur, which had to be particularly deep in order to bury the bodies of two plague victims.\n\nThe find location was at the spot where the altar of the first church of Sandur (the second church ever on the Faroe Island) stood. Today historians conjecture that this church was the private chapel of a wealthy farmer, since in the immediate neighborhood a Viking cemetery was excavated. It could be that this treasure belonged to the wealthy farmer and not to the church.\n\nIf the coins were from a wealthy farmer, the large number of coins from Germany point towards the export of Faroese wool there and/or to middlemen, who traded using these coins.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "498852", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=498852", "title": "Stylistic device", "text": "Stylistic device\n\nIn literature and writing, stylistic elements are the use of any of a variety of techniques to give an auxiliary meaning, idea, or feeling to the literal or written.\n\nA figure of speech is any way of saying something other than the ordinary way. Figurative language is language using figures of speech.\n\nThe easiest stylistic device to identify is a simile, signaled by use of the words \"like\" or \"as\". A simile is a comparison used to attract the reader's attention and describe something in descriptive terms.\n\nA metaphor is a comparison which does not use the words \"like\" or \"as\". Metaphors can span over multiple sentences.\n\nExample: \"That boy is like a machine.\" is a simile but \"That boy is a machine!\" is a metaphor.\n\nSynecdoche occurs when a part of something is used to refer to the whole. Many examples of synecdoche are idioms, common to the language.\n\nMetonymy is similar to synecdoche, but instead of a part representing the whole, a related object or part of a related object is used to represent the whole. Often it is used to represent the whole of an abstract idea.\n\nGiving human or animal characteristics to inanimate objects.\n\nSimilar to 'personification' but direct. The speaker addresses someone absent or dead, or addresses an inanimate or abstract object as if it were human.\n\nThis is when the name of a character has a symbolic meaning. For example, in Dickens' \"Great Expectations\", Miss Havisham has a sham, or lives a life full of pretense. In Hawthorne's \"The Scarlet Letter\", Rev. Dimmesdale metaphorically fades away (dims) as the novel progresses, while Chillingworth has a cold (chilled) heart.\n\nA symbol may be an object, a person, a situation, an action, a word, or an idea that has literal meaning in the story as well as an alternative identity that represents something else. It is used as an expressive way to depict an idea. The symbol generally conveys an emotional response far beyond what the word, idea, or image itself dictates.\n\nAn allegory is a story that has a second meaning, usually by endowing characters, objects or events with symbolic significance. The entire story functions symbolically; often a pattern relates each literal item to a corresponding abstract idea or principle. Although the surface story may have its own interest, the author's major interest is in the ulterior meaning.\n\nThis is when the author invokes sensory details. Often, this is simply to draw a reader more deeply into a story by helping the reader visualize what is being described. However, imagery may also symbolize important ideas in a story.\n\nFor example, in Saki's \"The Interlopers\", two men engaged in a generational feud become trapped beneath a fallen tree in a storm: \"Ulrich von Gradwitz found himself stretched on the ground, one arm numb beneath him and the other held almost as helplessly in a tight tangle of forked branches, while both legs were pinned beneath the fallen mass.\" Readers can not only visualize the scene, but may infer from it that it is actually the feud that has trapped him. Note also the diction used within the imagery: words like \"forked\" and \"fallen\" imply a kind of hell that he is trapped in.\n\nWhen a word, phrase, image, or idea is repeated throughout a work or several works of literature.\n\nFor example, in Ray Bradbury's short story, \"There Will Come Soft Rains\", he describes a futuristic \"smart house\" in a post-nuclear-war time period. All life is dead except for one dog, which dies in the course of the story. However, Bradbury mentions mice, snakes, robins, swallows, giraffes, antelopes, and many other animals in the course of the story. This animal motif establishes a contrast between the past, when life was flourishing, and the story's present, when all life is dead.\n\nMotifs may also be used to establish mood (as the blood motif in Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\"), for foreshadowing (as when Mary Shelley, in \"Frankenstein\", mentions the moon almost every time the creature is about to appear), to support the theme (as when, in Sophocles' drama \"Oedipus Rex\", the motif of prophecy strengthens the theme of the irresistibility of the gods), or for other purposes.\n\nIn literary terminology, a paradox is an apparent contradiction that is nevertheless somehow true. Paradox can take the form of an oxymoron, overstatement or understatement. Paradox can blend into irony.\n\nThe repetition of identical or similar sounds, usually accented vowel sounds and succeeding consonant sounds at the end of words, and often at the ends of lines of prose or poetry.\n\nFor example, in the following lines from a poem by A.E. Housman, the last words of both lines rhyme with each other.\n\nAlliteration is the repetition of consonant sounds at the beginning of words.\n\nAlliteration is used by an author to create emphasis, to add beauty to the writing style, and occasionally to aid in shaping the mood. It is also used to create a rhythm and musical effect on the reader's mind as well.\n\nSimilar to alliteration, in which vowel sounds are repeated. They are usually in the middle of a word.\n\nSimilar to alliteration, but the consonants are at the ends of words.\n\nIt is most important in poetry, but also used in prose for emphasis and aesthetic gain.\n\n\"Example:\" The fallibly irrevocable cat met its intrinsic match in the oppositional form of a dog.\n\nThis includes words that sound like their meaning, or imitations of sounds.\n\n\"Example:\" \"The bees were buzzing\"\n\nFormal structure refers to the forms of a text. In the first place, a text is either a novel, a drama, a poem, or some other \"form\" of literature. However, this term can also refer to the length of lines, stanzas, or cantos in poems, as well as sentences, paragraphs, or chapters in prose. Furthermore, such visible structures as dialogue versus narration are also considered part of formal structure.\n\nThe storyline is the chronological account of events that follow each other in the narrative. Plot includes the storyline, and is more; it includes the way in which elements in the story interact to create complexity, intrigue, and surprise. Plot is often created by having separate threads of storyline interact at critical times and in unpredictable ways, creating unexpected twists and turns in the overall storyline.\n\nPlot structure refers to the configuration of a plot in terms of its exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution/denouement. For example, Dickens' novel \"Great Expectations\" is noted for having only a single page of exposition before the rising action begins, while \"The Lord of the Rings\" by J. R. R. Tolkien has an unusually lengthy falling action. Plot can also be structured by use of devices such as flashbacks, framing and epistolary elements.\n\nA flashback (which is one of the most easily recognized utilization of plot structure) is a scene in a writing which occurs outside of the current timeline, before the events that are actually occurring in the story. It is used to explain plot elements, give background and context to a scene, or explain characteristics of characters or events.\n\nFor instance, one chapter may be at the present time in a character's life, and then the next chapter might be the character's life years ago. The second chapter gives meaning to the first, as it explains other events the character experienced and thus puts present events in context. In Khaled Hosseini's \"The Kite Runner\", the first short chapter occurs in the narrative's real time; most of the remainder of the book is a flashback.\n\nWhen there is a lengthy flashback comprising more than half of the text, a frame story is the portion outside the flashback. For example, Mary Shelley's \"Frankenstein\" uses the adventures of a sea captain as a frame story for the famous tale of the scientist and his creation. Occasionally, an author will have an unfinished frame, such as in Henry James's \"The Turn of the Screw\". The lack of a finishing frame in this story has the effect of leaving the reader disoriented, adding to the disturbed mood of the story.\n\nThis is when the author drops clues about what is to come in a story, which builds tension and the reader's suspense throughout the book.\n\nAllusion is a reference to something from history or literature.\n\nThis is the simplest form of irony, in which the speaker says the opposite of what he or she intends. There are several forms, including euphemism, understatement, sarcasm, and some forms of humor.\n\nThis is when the author creates a surprise that is the perfect opposite of what one would expect, often creating either humor or an eerie feeling. For example, in Steinbeck's novel \"The Pearl\", one would think that Kino and Juana would have become happy and successful after discovering the \"Pearl of the World\", with all its value. However, their lives changed dramatically for the worse after discovering it.\n\nSimilarly, in Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\", the title character almost kills King Claudius at one point, but resists because Claudius is praying and therefore may go to heaven. As Hamlet wants Claudius to go to hell, he waits. A few moments later, after Hamlet leaves the stage, Claudius reveals that he doesn't really mean his prayers (\"words without thoughts never to heaven go\"), so Hamlet should have killed him after all.\n\nThe way to remember the name is that it's for an \"ironic situation\".\n\nDramatic Irony is when the reader knows something important about the story that one or more characters in the story do not know. For example, in William Shakespeare's \"Romeo and Juliet\", the drama of Act V comes from the fact that the audience knows Juliet is alive, but Romeo thinks she's dead. If the audience had thought, like Romeo, that she was dead, the scene would not have had anywhere near the same power.\n\nLikewise, in Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Tell-Tale Heart\", the energy at the end of the story comes from the fact that we know the narrator killed the old man, while the guests are oblivious. If we were as oblivious as the guests, there would be virtually no point to the story.\n\nThe way to remember the name is that dramatic irony adds to the \"drama\" of the story.\n\nSee Irony for a more detailed discussion, and definitions of other forms of irony.\n\nDiction is the choice of specific words to communicate not only meaning, but emotion as well. Authors writing their texts consider not only a word's denotation, but also its connotation. For example, a person may be described as stubborn or tenacious, both of which have the same basic meaning, but are opposite in terms of their emotional background (the first is an insult, while the second is a compliment). Similarly, a bargain-seeker may be described as either thrifty (compliment) or stingy (insult). An author's diction is extremely important in discovering the narrator's tone, or attitude.\n\nSentences can be long or short, written in the active voice or passive voice, composed as simple, compound, complex, or compound-complex. They may also include such techniques as inversion or such structures as appositive phrases, verbal phrases (gerund, participle, and infinitive), and subordinate clauses (noun, adjective, and adverb). These tools can be highly effective in achieving an author's purpose.\n\nExample: The ghetto was ruled by neither German nor Jew; it was ruled by delusion. (from \"Night\", by Elie Wiesel)\n\nIn this sentence, Wiesel uses two parallel independent clauses written in the passive voice. The first clause establishes suspense about who actually rules the ghetto, and then the first few words of the second clause set up the reader with the expectation of an answer, which is metaphorically revealed only in the final word of the sentence.\n\nIn grammar, there are two voices: active and passive. These terms can be applied to whole sentences or to verbs.\nVerbs also have tense, aspect and mode.\nThere are three tenses: past, present and future.\nThere are two main aspects: perfect and progressive. Some grammarians refer to aspects as tenses, but this is not strictly correct, as the perfect and progressive aspects convey information other than time.\nThere are many modes (also called moods). Some important ones are: declarative, affirmative, negative, emphatic, conditional, imperative, interrogative and subjunctive.\n\nTone expresses the writer's or speaker's attitude toward the subject, the reader, or herself or himself.\n\n\n"}

The Tamu societies are created around the world as a means to preserve Tamu's unique culture outside of Nepal. They organise cultural events, such as festivals of dance, music, and food. They also engage in humanitarian, social and educational activities. There are a number of Tamu Samajs around the world, including: Tamu Samaj Sydney, Tamu Samaj Victoria, Tamu Samaj UK, but some inherit different names such as \"Gurung Tamu Society\".\nTamu Samajs were originally formed to spread a sense of solidarity among Tamus living in Nepal and abroad. They are a central part of the community's social gatherings, activities and events.\n\nIn 1958, Bernard Pignede, a French student of anthropology came to Nepal to study about Gurungs. He spent seven months in a Gurung village Mohoriya (Kaski, Gandaki) and traveled through many neighboring Gurung villages to do his research. He learned to speak tamu-kuwei (gurung dialect) and documented pretty much everything about the gurungs – their social structure, culture, religion, history, occupations, legends and myths. He translated pae, a ritual and religious practice that one gurung generation has passed down to another for thousands of years. Pae conveys the oral history of gurungs and is considered very sacred. Unfortunately, Pignede died in 1961 at age of 29. After his death, Professor Louis Dumont published Pegnedes work in 1966. The book was immediately recognized as a major contribution to the anthropology of the Himalayas. Later, two noted anthropologists – Sarah Harrison and Alan Macfarlane translated it in English and published the first English version in 1993. Harrison and Macfarlane studied further of gurungs and added more to Pignede’s work. The English version of this book is called “The Gurungs”, which is probably the most acclaimed research on Gurungs so far.\n\nThe Gurungs are famous for their culture. Various studies today have, however, shown that this division is an imposition from outside, and the Gurungs are divided into various subgroups; and they did not conform to the caste system. In Gurung society Chima holds the main responsibility for managing the village administration and also settles disputes in the village. Rodhighar is among the major identity of the social system of Gurung. Some have called the Rodhighar a house to thread wool, while others have called it a place to settle for the night. The Rodhighar is a good example of cooperation, assistance, better relation and collective spirits among the Gurungs.\n"}

The play, according to Suassuna, is a \"Northeastern imitation\" from the play \"Aulularia\" (a.k.a. \"The Pot's Comedy\"), from the Roman writer Plautus.\n\nThe story focuses in Eurico Árabe, who is called Euricão Engole-Cobra (something like \"Euricão Swallows-Snake\") by his employees. Eurico is a \"rich\" and niggard man who has a beautiful and courteous daughter called Margarida and two employees: a smart housemaid called Caroba and his \"Official Servant\" Dódó, who is Margarida's secret boyfriend.\n\nOne day, a man called Pinhão (who is Caroba's secret boyfriend) arrives in Eurico's house with a letter from the rich and powerful Colonel Eudoro. It was written in the letter:\n\n\"My dear and honored Eurico: I expect you have being enjoying your peace and prosperty! Above all, I desire that your charming daughter Margarida be fine and healthy like she was in the days that she spent in my house, if you remember. I sent this letter with my loyal employee Pinhão to advise you of the visit I will make to your home soon and I fear that I will steal your most precious treasure.\"\n\nThen, Eurico becomes mad thinking that Eudoro will steal his coffer (that is in the form of a pig - in this case, a sow) and tries to \"stop\" Eudoro's robbery. But Caroba, in a secret meeting with Margarida, Pinhão and Dodó, tells them that the \"most precious treasure\" in the letter referred to Margarida and that Eudoro was going to marry her. Then they make a plan to try to reconcile Eudoro with his old love, Benona. But they will have to take care about Eurico, who is trying to protect his \"sow coffer\".\n\nA despite of being part of the title, the saint is not important to the play. In fact, the saint is a statue of Saint Antonio, to whom Eurico prays a lot (usually asking for more money or for protection of his \"sow coffer\").\n\nThe play is divided in three acts:\n\nThe play is considered, by the Brazilian critics, as being Suassuna's second best play\n, only behind his classic O Auto da Compadecida.\n\n"}

Goren-Inbar of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. An article by Goren-Inbar and S. Peltz (1995) claims it has been modified to represent a female human figure, identifying it as a possible artifact made by \"Homo erectus\" of the later Acheulean, in the early Middle Paleolithic. The term \"Venus\" follows the convention for labelling the unrelated Venus figurines of the Upper Paleolithic. The claim is contested.\n\nThe base object is an anthropomorphic red tufic pebble, 35 mm (1.4 in) long, which has had at least three grooves, possibly incised on it by a sharp-edged stone. One is a deep groove that encircles the narrower, more rounded end of the pebble, two shallower, curved grooves run down the sides. These grooves can be interpreted as marking the neck and arms of a figure. They closely resemble marks made in similar material by sharp-edged tools during exercises in experimental archaeology.\n\nThe claim that the pebble has been incised to represent a human figure has been questioned in three ways:\n\nIt is disputed whether these can be clearly distinguished from naturally-created lines. In 1997, American researcher Alexander Marshack argued using microscopic analysis that the grooves around the \"neck\" and down the \"arms\" were human made. However, Steven Mithen in 1999 argued that Marshack's arguments \"do not demonstrate that the lines are indeed intentional and that if they were that they were intended to represent a female figure\". He took the view that research was yet to be done to determine whether \"scoria found in non-archaeological contexts\" could \"carry incisions that might be confused with stone tools\"\n\nIt remains uncertain whether or not the pebble has been modified by human action. If it has, there is the separate question of whether the scratches had any artistic or symbolic intent, and if so, whether they sought to make the object resemble the female form, as do the much later and rather different Venus figurines of the Upper Palaeolithic.\n\nIn 2000, d'Errico and Nowell argued that the incisions could be reliably identified as human-made, but a practical function related to tool-making could not be ruled out: \"the use of different types of raw materials to produce a varied tool kit seems well documented.\" However, some of the abrasions \"are not necessarily consistent with a functional use of the object\", suggesting that symbolic intent is a serious possibility. They conclude that it is \"problematic\" to identify a human body, as the cognitive and cultural context is so alien, saying that probably there will never be any agreement about what was intended by the marks.\n\nBecause it was found between two layers of ash, it has been dated by tephrochronology to at least 230,000 years before the present. If the artifact was intended to replicate a female figure, it would be the earliest example of representational art in the archaeological record. Rather than being made by modern humans, it would have been made by Neanderthals or perhaps by \"Homo erectus\", hunter-gatherers and Acheulean tool users. There is some other evidence of an aesthetic sensibility during the period although compelling examples do not appear in the archaeological record until the emergence of behaviorally modern humans around 50,000 years ago.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "58455240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58455240", "title": "Weddings in Myanmar", "text": "Weddings in Myanmar\n\nWeddings in Myanmar, considered auspicious occasions in Burmese culture, reflect various ethnic, religious, and regional traditions. Depending on personal preferences and economic status, Burmese weddings can be religious or secular, and extravagant or simple. \n\nThe wedding traditions of the Bamar people (Burmans), who comprise the majority of Myanmar's population, incorporate a number of rituals and practices. Wedding expenses are typically borne by the groom's family. Dowries are typically unheard of, and arranged marriage is not a custom of the Burmese. \n\nTraditional Burmese folklore considers love to be destiny, as the Hindu god Brahma writes one's destiny in love on a child's brow when he or she is six days old, called \"na hpuza\" (, lit. \"destiny on the forehead\"). \n\nBuddhist monks are not present to conduct the wedding and solemnise the marriage, as they are forbidden to officiate weddings, which are considered a worldly affair (\"lokiya\"). However, they may be invited to bless the newly wed couple and recite a protective \"paritta\". Typically, the bride and groom arrange an almsgiving feast called \"mingala hsun\" (မင်္ဂလာဆွမ်း) to monks the morning of the wedding.\n\nTraditionally, a marriage is recognised with or without a ceremony when the man's longyi (sarong) is seen hanging from a rail of the house or if the couple eats from the same plate. A more extravagant wedding requires months of preparation, including consultation with an astrologer in choosing the most auspicious date and time in accordance with the Burmese calendar. The traditional Burmese months of Tagu, Kason, Nayon, Thadingyut, Tazaungmon, and Tabodwe are considered auspicious for weddings. Weddings are traditionally avoided during the Buddhist lent, which lasts three months from July to October.\nThe groom's family formally asks the bride's family for their blessing by offering a receptacle of a green coconut with its stalk intact encircled by bunches of green bananas called \"ohn bwe ngapyaw bwe\" (ငှက်ပျောပွဲအုန်းပွဲ). The wedding details are negotiated between the families. Some Bamar families invite a spirit medium to protect the couple under the care of the household nat (spirit).\n\nAlso, a master of ceremonies (ဘိသိက်ဆရာ), typically a brahmin, consecrates the ceremony. More elaborate wedding receptions include entertainment from musicians, and the wedding is ended with a speech by a guest of higher social standing. In urban areas, wedding receptions tend to be held at hotels. In rural areas, wedding pavilions are temporarily erected to host the festivities. Gift-giving is an important element of Bamar weddings.\n\nA traditional Bamar wedding ceremony is divided into seven chapters, namely:\n\nThroughout the ceremony, the bride and groom sit on cushions next to each other. At the beginning of the wedding, the Brahmin blows a conch shell to commence the ceremony. Offerings of \"ohn bwe ngapyaw bwe\", and six ceremonial trays containing rice, popcorn, grated betel nut and coconut, jasmine flowers, and red and white steamed glutinous rice cakes and 7 fried whole fish, are prepared for the ceremony. The couple pays obeisance to the Buddha, spirits and parents, holding a bouquet of eugenia sprigs and flowers chosen according to the birthdays of the couple. The master of ceremony joins the palms of the couple, wraps them in white cloth, and dips the joined palms in a silver or gold bowl. The Burmese word \"to marry\" is \"let htat\" (), which literally means \"to join palms together.\" After chanting a few Sanskrit mantras, the brahmin takes the couple's joined palms out of the bowl and blows the conch shell to end the ceremony. \n\nThere are ten commonly observed Bamar wedding rites:\n\n\nThe Mon people have a number of unique wedding traditions. The groom's family traditionally bears the wedding costs. The wedding itself is preceded by an engagement ceremony, in which 5 elders from the bride's family host 5 set of parents from the groom's family to negotiate the financial terms of the marriage, including a dowry. The parties also negotiate the details of the wedding ceremony, including the food to be served and the date. The Mon exclusively wed during the Burmese months of Tazaungmon and Tabaung. After the wedding details are finalized, young virgins are dispatched to invite wedding attendees in nearby areas, bearing wedding cards and gifts of Betel Nut or lahpet (pickled tea leaves). \n\nIn the lead-up to the wedding, the bride's family home, which serves as the ceremonial venue, is decorated. On the eve of the wedding, three virgins send gifts of pumpkin, coconut, papaya and khanom chin (vermicelli) to the bride's home, and the bride reciprocates the gifts with cigarettes. On the wedding day, the groom's family leads a procession to the bride's family home. The groom's eldest sister bears a gift basket containing a coconut sapling, areca palm, area nuts, betel leaves, pickled tea leaves, and household items including pepper, onion, rice, oil, and salt, while the youngest daughters carry lacquerware to the venue. Both the bride and groom are splashed with water using Eugenia leaves. The wedding ceremony continues with an exchange of gifts. Following the ceremony, the newlywed couple spend 7 days in each other's family homes.\n\nThe Rakhine people practice a wedding ceremony called \"thamet tet pwe\" (သမက်တက်ပွဲ), literally \"ceremony of the son-in-law's ascent\". The groom dons a \"taungshay paso\" and gaung baung, while the bride wears an outfit including a \"htaingmathein\" jacket embroidered with celestial beings, birds, and a lion. A wedding table is set for the ceremony, sprinkled with paddy seeds and silver coins symbolizing prosperity and fertility. A platter of steamed sticky rice, signifying the couple's unity, is placed on the table. Atop the sticky rice are a pair of cooked prawns, fried whole fish, boiled duck eggs and sweet potatoes. The couple then don ceremonial wedding headdresses (ဦးသျှောင်). Holy thread is then encircled and tied around the wedding table nine times. The couple partake in offering morsels of food to their parents. Then, the bride and groom take off their headdresses. The groom places his headdress on the bride's head, solemnizing the wedding.\n\nThe Chin people have a wide-ranging number of wedding traditions. The engagement is initiated by the groom's parents, who gift a bottle of alcohol to the bride's family in a rite called \"zuthawl pia\". After negotiating the wedding details, ta \"mopina\" ceremony is held to take the bride from her family home. The families haggle and exchange cash, and the bride's family equips their daughter with a basket, blanket, mattock, axe, and bottle (or in modern times, money and jewels). The introduction of Christianity has displaced some traditional Chin rites. \n\nAmong the Asho Chin, shaman called \"pasung saya\" officiate and organize traditional wedding ceremonies. In a significant wedding rite, a pig is slaughtered at dawn and its liver is extracted for examination. The \"pasung\" \"saya\" examines the liver to read the couple's future as a married couple. \n"}

{"id": "1566846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1566846", "title": "Zócalo", "text": "Zócalo\n\nThe Zócalo () is the common name of the main square in central Mexico City. Prior to the colonial period, it was the main ceremonial center in the Aztec city of Tenochtitlan. The plaza used to be known simply as the \"Main Square\" or \"Arms Square,\" and today its formal name is Plaza de la Constitución (\"Constitution Square\"). This name does not come from any of the Mexican constitutions that have governed the country but rather from the Cádiz Constitution which was signed in Spain in the year 1812. Even so, it is almost always called the \"Zócalo\" today. Plans were made to erect a column as a monument to Independence, but only the base, or \"zócalo\" (meaning \"plinth\") was built. The plinth was buried long ago but the name has lived on. Many other Mexican towns and cities, such as Oaxaca, Merida and Guadalajara, have adopted the word \"zócalo\" to refer to their main plazas, but not all.\n\nIt has been a gathering place for Mexicans since Aztec times, having been the site of Mexica ceremonies, the swearing in of viceroys, royal proclamations, military parades, Independence ceremonies and modern religious events such as the festivals of Holy Week and Corpus Christi. It has received foreign heads of state and is the main venue for both national celebration and national protest. The Zocalo and surrounding blocks have played a central role in the city's planning and geography for almost 700 years. The site is just one block southwest of the Templo Mayor which, according to Aztec legend and mythology, was considered the center of the universe.\n\nThe modern Zócalo in Mexico City is 57,600 m (240 m × 240 m). It is bordered by the Cathedral to the north, the National Palace to the east, the Federal District buildings to the south and the Old Portal de Mercaderes to the west, the Nacional Monte de Piedad building at the north-west corner, with the Templo Mayor site to the northeast, just outside view. In the centre is a flagpole with an enormous Mexican flag ceremoniously raised and lowered each day and carried into the National Palace. There is an entrance to the Metro station \"Zócalo\" located at the northeast corner of the square but no sign above ground indicates its presence.\n\nPrior to the conquest, the area that the occupies was open space, in the center of the Aztec capital . It was bordered to the east by 's \"New Houses\" or Palace (which would become the National Palace) and to the west by the \"Old Houses\", the palace of (1469–1481) where the Emperor , 's uncle and immediate predecessor also lived. A European-style plaza was not part of the conquered Aztec ; the old city had a sacred precinct or which was the absolute center of the city (and the universe, according to Aztec belief), but it was located to the immediate north and northeast of the modern-day .\n\nThe current occupies a space south-southwest of the intersection of roads that oriented . The north–south road was called (for the locations north and south it led to). The road led west and stretched east a little before leading into the lake that surrounded the city at the time. These roads were the width of three jousting lances according to . This intersection divided the city into four neighborhoods. The sacred precinct, containing the , was located to the northeast of this intersection and walled off from the open area for commoners. As to this area's relationship to the proper, some historians say that it was part of it, but others say no.\n\nThe modern plaza of Mexico City was placed by Alonso Garcia Bravo shortly after the invasion when he laid out what is now the historic center. After the destruction of Tenochtitlan, Cortés had the city redesigned for symbolic purposes. He kept the four major neighborhoods or \"capullis\" but he had a church, now the Cathedral of Mexico City, built at the place the four adjoined. He had the Temo become the Cathedral). The southern half was called the \"Plaza Mayor\" (Main Square) and the northern one was called the \"Plaza Chica\" (Small Square). Fairly early in the colonial period, the Plaza Chica would be swallowed up by the growing city.\n\nDuring early colonial times, the Plaza was bordered to the north by the new church, and to the east by Cortés's new palace, built over and with the ruins of Moctezuma's palace. On the west side of the plaza, the Portales de Mercaderes (Merchants’ Portals) were built, south of Cortés’ other palace, the Palace of the Marquis of the Valley of Oaxaca. On the south side, was the Portal of the Flowers (Flores), named so after its owner, Maria Gutierrez Flores de Caballerias. Next to this portal was the House of the Ayuntamiento, a government building for the city. Both of these were behind a small drainage canal that ran east-west.\n\nFlooding was always an issue for the Plaza and the city in general. The plaza was flooded in 1629 with water two meters deep, ruining many of the merchants located there and requiring many of the portals to be rebuilt. The project to control flooding, known as the \"desagüe\" drafted Indian men over nearly the whole colonial period, to work on this major infrastructure project. Controlling flooding meant health benefits for Mexico City residents by preventing human waste from polluting the city during floods and controlling mosquitoes, which spread disease. It also changed the ecological system that supported birds and fish populations and allowed for Indian cultivation of crops.\n\nAfter the Cathedral was constructed in the latter half of the 16th century, the look of the Plaza changed. The old church faced east and not to the Plaza itself. The new Cathedral's three portals towered south over the Plaza and giving the area a north-south orientation, which exists to this day.\n\nOver much of the 17th century, the Plaza became overrun with market stalls. After a mob burned the Viceregal Palace in the 1692, depicted in the famous 1696 painting by Cristóbal de Villalpando, authorities attempted to completely clear the Plaza to make way for the \"Parian\", a set of shops set in the southwest corner of the Plaza used to warehouse and sell products brought by galleons from Europe and Asia. This was opened in 1703. The Parián is shown at the bottom of Villalpando's painting; it was later destroyed in an 1828 riot.\n\nThis, however, did not keep the rest of the Plaza from becoming filled again with makeshift stalls such as the group known as \"San José\" located next to the Parian itself. This prompted historian Francisco Sedano to comment that it was ugly and unsightly. He claimed it was very difficult to walk around here at the time because of its uneven pavement, mud in the rainy season, aggressive street dogs, mounds of trash and human excrement tossed among the corn husks and other discarded wrappings.\n\nAgain the Plaza was cleared (with exception of the Parian) by proclamation of Charles IV of Spain in December 1789. Then-viceroy Juan Vicente Güemes Pacheco had the Plaza repaved and the open gutters covered with stone blocks. He also had a fountain installed in each corner. During this work, the Aztec Calendar was unearthed, as well as a statue of the goddess Coatlicue. The Calendar was put on display on the west side of the Cathedral, where it remained until about 1890 when it was moved to the old \"Centro Museum\". It now resides in the Museum of Anthropology. The statue eventually made its way to this museum, but not until it was practically buried in one of the back patios of the Royal and Pontifical University until after Independence. The former merchants of the Plaza were moved primarily to a new building called the \"Mercado de Volador\" (Market of the Flyer), located southeast of the Plaza where the Supreme Court building stands today.\n\nThe Plaza was converted into public space with 64 lamps. The Cathedral was separated from the Plaza by iron grating; 124 stone benches were placed and the Plaza was marked off by low iron poles connected by an iron chain. The main feature of the redesigned plaza was an equestrian statue of Charles IV by Manuel Tolsá. It was first placed in the southeastern corner of the Plaza, first on a gilded wood base to inaugurate it in December 1803. When the monument was completely finished, the wooden base was replaced by an oval one of stone measuring 113 meters by 95.5 meters, with its own balustrade and fountains at the corners created by José del Mazo.\n\nThis was the backdrop when Viceroy Don Felix Maria Calleja, other authorities and assembled people swore allegiance to the Constitution of Cadiz, and fealty to the Spanish Crown on 22 May 1813 as the Mexican War of Independence raged. This event also resulted in renaming the square as the \"Plaza of the Constitution.\" The last changes to the Plaza before Independence in 1821 were done by Manuel Tolsá placing the Cross of Mañozca at the southeast corner and placing another, similar cross to the northwest. Both of these were set on stone Neoclassical pedestals.\n\nA symbolic move upon Independence was the dismantling and removal of the equestrian monument to Charles IV from Plaza. The statue itself can still be seen in front of the National Art Museum where its current, and much smaller, base states that it is preserved solely for its artistic value. The statue's former oval base was moved to what was then the University building and the balustrade was moved to the Alameda Central. This left the Plaza bare except for the Parian.\n\nOn 4 and 5 December 1828, the Parián market, the most active of Mexico City's markets, was looted and damaged by a popular uprising. A number of merchants died and most were ruined. President Santa Anna finally had the Parián demolished in 1843. This left the Plaza bare again, except for some ash trees and flower gardens that were planted and protected by stone borders. Santa Anna wanted to build a monument to Mexican Independence in the center of the Plaza but his project got only as far as the base (zócalo), which stayed there for decades and gave the Plaza its current popular name. It stayed this way until 1866 when the Paseo (path) del Zócalo was created in response to the numbers of people who were using the plaza to take walks. A garden with footpaths was created; fountains were placed at each corner; 72 iron benches were installed and the area was lighted by hydrogen gas lamps. Santa Anna's base, however, was not removed.\n\nIn 1878, Antonio Escandon donated a kiosk to the city which was set over and on top of Santa Anna's base. It was lit with four large iron candelabras and designed to be similar to one in the Bois de Boulogne in Paris. Soon afterward, the company \"Ferrocarriles del Distrito Federal\" (\"Trains of the Federal District\") converted part of the Zócalo into a streetcar station with ticket kiosk and stand. The streetcars and lighting were converted to electric power in 1894, and the Zócalo's paths were paved with asphalt in 1891.\n\nFrom the latter half of the nineteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth, the Zócalo again filled with market stalls, including the \"Centro Mercantil\" which sold fabric, clothing, and Art Nouveau stonework. The other stalls concentrated on more mundane merchandise. This caused pedestrians to take their walks on Alameda Central or on San Francisco and Madero streets, to the west of the Zócalo.\n\nDuring the \"Decena Trágica\" (the ten days from 9 to 19 February 1913), the National Palace was bombarded from the nearby military fort, incidentally damaging the \"Zócalo\". In 1914, the ash trees planted in the previous century (which meanwhile had grown considerably) were taken out; new footpaths, grassy areas, and garden space were created; and palm trees were planted in each corner of the plaza.\n\nThe \"Zócalo\" was a meeting place for protests for 1 May. In 1968, students protested against the authoritarian measures taken by then-president Gustavo Díaz Ordaz. It was also the starting point of the marathon run in the 1968 Summer Olympics. But the plaza deteriorated until, by the 1970s, all that was left were light poles and a large flagpole in the middle. Then the ground was leveled again, the train tracks taken out, and the whole plaza cemented over. Automobile parking was prohibited and the plaza's shape was squared to 200 meters on each side. Later in the 1970s, the \"Zócalo\" was repaved with pink cobblestones; small trees protected by metal grates were planted, and small areas of grass were seeded around the flagpole.\n\nAs the end of the twentieth century neared, the \"Zócalo\", along with most of the city center (called the \"Colonia Centro\") was in massive disrepair. This caused \"The Economist\" magazine to remark that the \"Zócalo\" and the area surrounding it \"... should be one of the most compelling architectural destinations in the Americas. Instead, much of it is a slum of gutted buildings, dark and dirty streets blocked by milling vendors, and garbage-strewn vacant lots.\"\n\nIn the late 1990s, Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas, then mayor of Mexico City, and Dr. Rene Coulomb, general director of the Historic Center Trust, launched a $300,000,000 renovation of the \"Zócalo\" and the surrounding city center, with the aim of attracting businesses and residents back to the area. There were plans to remove the iron grating separating the Cathedral from the \"Zócalo\", but there was so much public opposition to the idea that it was eventually scrapped.\n\nRecently, former mayor Marcelo Ebrard launched a campaign to perform maintenance works in the Historic Center (which, because of Congressional reduction of the annual budget of the local government, was largely supported with the money collected in the streets for that purpose by government officials). The campaign had satisfactory results.\n\nIn 2010, a replica of the Angel de la Independencia was brought to Zócalo as a way of spreading out the protesters from the original Angel site. This is because the original site of the Angel is located in a financial area, with a high traffic flow, making policing more difficult than the Zócalo.\n\nThe Zócalo is the center of government of both the nation and of the capital, where the powers-that-be are. This makes it a popular place for protests, and it is often dotted with protesters in makeshift camps and banners. As the plaza can hold more than 100,000 people, it is also the scene of major political rallies. Thousands rallied here in protest when Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas lost against Carlos Salinas in a presidential election widely believed to have been rigged in 1988. In 2001, followers of Zapatista leader Subcomandante Marcos, mostly poor Chiapan indigenous people, marched into the Zócalo to support a bill that would give them greater political autonomy. Following Cárdenas’ lead, Andrés Manuel López Obrador staged major protests here after the 2006 Mexican presidential elections as well as a rally with thousands of participants against President Calderón's initiative to allow private and foreign investment in Mexico's state-owned energy company, PEMEX. On 30 August 2008, a peaceful protest against crime and violence filled the Zócalo to capacity.\n\nThe plaza is also home to regularly occurring political events. Just before 11 pm on each 15 September, the president of Mexico comes out onto the central balcony of the National Palace to perform the Grito de Dolores to the crowd gathered in the plaza. Even this is sometimes subject to the political winds of the country. For the 2006 Grito, the crowd in the Zócalo was addressed not by then-President Vicente Fox, who had gone to Dolores Hidalgo, Guanajuato to deliver the Grito, but by Alejandro Encinas, then-mayor of Mexico City. This was done to avoid mass protests in the Zócalo following the disputed presidential election between Felipe Calderón and López Obrador. Under the unpopular rule of Enrique Peña Nieto, the ceremony has been subjected to widespread criticism —mostly from left-leaning sources— for the government's notorious use of \"acarreados\" (people who are literally carried into the square by bus and paid for with food or other minor goods) in order to boost attendance numbers and simulate popular enthusiasm.\n\nAn alternative expression of Mexican pride is the celebration of the spring equinox on the Zócalo. This is done by groups looking to reassert the superiority of indigenous ethnic bloodlines (La Raza) and pre-Hispanic culture. They choose to do the ceremony here not only because it is close to where such rites used to be performed before the Spaniards came, but also because they are right next to the symbols of \"Spanish\" ecclesiastical and secular power (The Cathedral and National Palace, respectively), which they oppose.\n\nThe Zócalo area has been, since 2014, where large rallies have been held in the aftermath of the 2014 Iguala mass kidnapping, an event that has become symbolic for the climate of widespread criminality, impunity and governmental corruption that many feel the country faces.\n\nSince 1982, due to efforts to revitalize the city center, the Zócalo has become the scene of a number of artistic and cultural events. There are daily impromptu shows of Aztec dancers dancing to drums, wearing feathered headdresses and anklets made of concha shells. On a grander scale, some examples of events held here recently are Spencer Tunick's photo shoot where nearly 18,000 Mexicans bared all for the artist, surpassing the record set earlier in Barcelona and artist Gregory Colbert's Ashes and Snow Nomadic Museum. One curious event was the building of a temporary ice-skating rink of about 3,200 m² in the middle of the Zócalo, for use by the city's residents for free in the winter of 2007. Since then, the rink has been repeatedly built up for several winter seasons.\n\nThe Festival de México is an annual event with programs dedicated to art (popular and fine) and academia held in the Zócalo and some other venues in the historic center. In 2008, the 24th Festival had 254 performances and shows from over 20 countries in 65 plazas and other locations near the plaza.\n\nThe Zocalo is often the site of major parades in the city including the Mexico City Alebrije Parade.\n\nConcerts by popular singers and groups have also been held here. Café Tacuba drew almost 100,000 people to the plaza in 2005 and Colombian superstar Shakira drew a crowd of about 210,000 according to Mexico's Civil Protection. In August 2008, a skateboarding/BMX event drew 50,000 young people on a Sunday afternoon. Paul McCartney drew an attendance of 250,000 people for a free concert played on the plaza on May 10, 2012 as a part of his On the Run Tour. Justin Bieber also offered a free show on July 11, 2012, where he performed in front of 300,000 people as part of the tour for his 2012 album \"Believe\". On October 1, 2016, Roger Waters performed in the square before 170,000 people, once again for free and with a strong political message against Donald Trump and Enrique Peña Nieto included in sections of the show, which consisted of outtakes from his Pink Floyd years.\n\nThe Sci-Fi series Babylon 5 uses the name \"Zocalo\" as the station's main gathering place.\n\nDutch trance music producer Armin Van Buuren has a song called \"Zocalo\" on his 2005 album Shivers, which, Josh Gabriel, of Gabriel & Dresden, recounts is named after Zocalo Coffeehouse in San Leandro, California, which Armin visited while recording the song, and which is itself named after the Zocalo in Mexico City.\n\nThe pre-title sequence of the 2015 James Bond film \"Spectre\" took place largely \"above\" the Zocalo, as Bond takes command of a SPECTRE getaway helicopter. The scene is set against the Day of the Dead festival.\n"}
