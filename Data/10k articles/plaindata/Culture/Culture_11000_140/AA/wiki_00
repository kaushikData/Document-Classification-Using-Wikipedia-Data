{"id": "41805462", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41805462", "title": "Basis of articulation", "text": "Basis of articulation\n\nIn phonetics, the basis of articulation, also known as articulatory setting, is the default position or standard settings of a speaker's organs of articulation when ready to speak. Different languages each have their own basis of articulation, which means that native speakers will share a certain position of tongue, lips, jaw, possibly even uvula or larynx, when preparing to speak. These standard settings enable them to produce the sounds and prosody of their native language more efficiently. Honikman suggests thinking of it in terms of having a \"gear\" for English, another for French, and so on depending on which language is being learned; in the classroom, when working on pronunciation, the first thing the learner must do is to think themselves into the right gear before starting on pronunciation exercises. Jenner (2001) gives a detailed account of how this idea arose and how Honikman has been credited with its invention despite a considerable history of prior study.\n\nDifferent accents within a given language may have their own characteristic basis of articulation, resulting in one accent being perceived as, e.g., more 'nasal', 'velarized' or 'guttural' than another. According to Cruttenden, \"The articulatory setting of a language or dialect may differ from GB [General British]. So some languages like Spanish may have a tendency to hold the tongue more forward in the mouth, while others like Russian may have a tendency to hold it further back in the mouth. Nasalization may be characteristic of many speakers of American English, while denasal voice ... is frequently said to occur in Liverpool\". A more detailed exposition can be read in Gili Gaya (1956). Non-native speakers typically find the basis of articulation one of the greatest challenges in acquiring a foreign language's pronunciation. Speaking with the basis of articulation of their own native language results in a foreign accent, even if the individual sounds of the target language are produced correctly.\n\nThe term \"Basis of articulation\" is used in a slightly different sense to refer to a hypothesized articulatory \"baseline\" which is neutral in respect of individual vowels and consonants. This is done in the phonetic framework section of Chomsky and Halle (1968) for the purposes of explaining various distinctive features in terms of their deviation from the neutral position. More recently, Odden has written \"...some features are characterized in terms of the 'neutral position' which is a configuration that the vocal tract is assumed to have immediately prior to speaking. The neutral position, approximately that of the vowel [ɛ], defines relative movement of the tongue” It is not clear if this should be taken to refer only to English.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "155739", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=155739", "title": "Biological pest control", "text": "Biological pest control\n\nBiological control or biocontrol is a method of controlling pests such as insects, mites, weeds and plant diseases using other organisms. It relies on predation, parasitism, herbivory, or other natural mechanisms, but typically also involves an active human management role. It can be an important component of integrated pest management (IPM) programs.\n\nThere are three basic strategies for biological pest control: classical (importation), where a natural enemy of a pest is introduced in the hope of achieving control; inductive (augmentation), in which a large population of natural enemies are administered for quick pest control; and inoculative (conservation), in which measures are taken to maintain natural enemies through regular reestablishment.\n\nNatural enemies of insect pests, also known as biological control agents, include predators, parasitoids, pathogens, and competitors. Biological control agents of plant diseases are most often referred to as antagonists. Biological control agents of weeds include seed predators, herbivores and plant pathogens.\n\nBiological control can have side-effects on biodiversity through attacks on non-target species by any of the same mechanisms, especially when a species is introduced without thorough understanding of the possible consequences.\n\nThe term \"biological control\" was first used by Harry Scott Smith at the 1919 meeting of the Pacific Slope Branch of the American Association of Economic Entomologists, in Riverside, California. It was brought into more widespread use by the entomologist Paul H. DeBach (1914–1993) who worked on citrus crop pests throughout his life. However, the practice has previously been used for centuries. The first report of the use of an insect species to control an insect pest comes from \"Nanfang Caomu Zhuang\" (南方草木狀 \"Plants of the Southern Regions\") (ca. 304 AD), attributed to Western Jin dynasty botanist \"Ji Han\" (嵇含, 263–307), in which it is mentioned that \"Jiaozhi people sell ants and their nests attached to twigs looking like thin cotton envelopes, the reddish-yellow ant being larger than normal. Without such ants, southern citrus fruits will be severely insect-damaged\". The ants used are known as \"huang gan\" (\"huang\" = yellow, \"gan\" = citrus) ants (\"Oecophylla smaragdina\"). The practice was later reported by Ling Biao Lu Yi (late Tang Dynasty or Early Five Dynasties), in \"Ji Le Pian\" by \"Zhuang Jisu\" (Southern Song Dynasty), in the \"Book of Tree Planting\" by Yu Zhen Mu (Ming Dynasty), in the book \"Guangdong Xing Yu\" (17th century), \"Lingnan\" by Wu Zhen Fang (Qing Dynasty), in \"Nanyue Miscellanies\" by Li Diao Yuan, and others.\n\nBiological control techniques as we know them today started to emerge in the 1870s. During this decade, in the US, the Missouri State Entomologist C. V. Riley and the Illinois State Entomologist W. LeBaron began within-state redistribution of parasitoids to control crop pests. The first international shipment of an insect as biological control agent was made by Charles V. Riley in 1873, shipping to France the predatory mites \"Tyroglyphus phylloxera\" to help fight the grapevine phylloxera (\"Daktulosphaira vitifoliae\") that was destroying grapevines in France. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) initiated research in classical biological control following the establishment of the Division of Entomology in 1881, with C. V. Riley as Chief. The first importation of a parasitoidal wasp into the United States was that of the braconid \"Cotesia glomerata\" in 1883–1884, imported from Europe to control the invasive cabbage white butterfly, \"Pieris rapae\". In 1888–1889 the vedalia beetle, \"Rodolia cardinalis\", a lady beetle, was introduced from Australia to California to control the cottony cushion scale, \"Icerya purchasi\". This had become a major problem for the newly developed citrus industry in California, but by the end of 1889 the cottony cushion scale population had already declined. This great success led to further introductions of beneficial insects into the USA.\n\nIn 1905 the USDA initiated its first large-scale biological control program, sending entomologists to Europe and Japan to look for natural enemies of the gypsy moth, \"Lymantria dispar dispar\", and brown-tail moth, \"Euproctis chrysorrhoea\", invasive pests of trees and shrubs. As a result, nine parasitoids (solitary wasps) of gypsy moth, seven of brown-tail moth, and two predators of both moths became established in the USA. Although the gypsy moth was not fully controlled by these natural enemies, the frequency, duration, and severity of its outbreaks were reduced and the program was regarded as successful. This program also led to the development of many concepts, principles, and procedures for the implementation of biological control programs.\n\nPrickly pear cacti were introduced into Queensland, Australia as ornamental plants, starting in 1788. They quickly spread to cover over 25 million hectares of Australia by 1920, increasing by 1 million hectares per year. Digging, burning and crushing all proved ineffective. Two control agents were introduced to help control the spread of the plant, the cactus moth \"Cactoblastis cactorum\", and the scale insect \"Dactylopius\". Between 1926 and 1931, tens of millions of cactus moth eggs were distributed around Queensland with great success, and by 1932, most areas of prickly pear had been destroyed.\n\nThe first reported case of a classical biological control attempt in Canada involves the parasitoidal wasp \"Trichogramma minutum\". Individuals were caught in New York State and released in Ontario gardens in 1882 by William Saunders, trained chemist and first Director of the Dominion Experimental Farms, for controlling the invasive currantworm \"Nematus ribesii\". Between 1884 and 1908, the first Dominion Entomologist, James Fletcher, continued introductions of other parasitoids and pathogens for the control of pests in Canada.\n\nThere are three basic biological pest control strategies: importation (classical biological control), augmentation and conservation.\n\nImportation or classical biological control involves the introduction of a pest's natural enemies to a new locale where they do not occur naturally. Early instances were often unofficial and not based on research, and some introduced species became serious pests themselves.\n\nTo be most effective at controlling a pest, a biological control agent requires a colonizing ability which allows it to keep pace with changes to the habitat in space and time. Control is greatest if the agent has temporal persistence, so that it can maintain its population even in the temporary absence of the target species, and if it is an opportunistic forager, enabling it to rapidly exploit a pest population.\n\nJoseph Needham noted a Chinese text dating from 304 AD, \"Records of the Plants and Trees of the Southern Regions\", by Hsi Han, which describes mandarin oranges protected by large reddish-yellow citrus ants which attack and kill insect pests of the orange trees. The citrus ant (\"Oecophylla smaragdina\") was rediscovered in the 20th century, and since 1958 has been used in China to protect orange groves.\n\nOne of the earliest successes in the west was in controlling \"Icerya purchasi\" (cottony cushion scale) in Australia, using a predatory insect \"Rodolia cardinalis\" (the vedalia beetle). This success was repeated in California using the beetle and a parasitoidal fly, \"Cryptochaetum iceryae\". Other successful cases include the control of \"Antonina graminis\" in Texas by \"Neodusmetia sangwani\" in the 1960s.\n\nDamage from \"Hypera postica\", the alfalfa weevil, a serious introduced pest of forage, was substantially reduced by the introduction of natural enemies. 20 years after their introduction the population of weevils in the alfalfa area treated for alfalfa weevil in the Northeastern United States remained 75 percent down.\n\nAlligator weed was introduced to the United States from South America. It takes root in shallow water, interfering with navigation, irrigation, and flood control. The alligator weed flea beetle and two other biological controls were released in Florida, greatly reducing the amount of land covered by the plant. Another aquatic weed, the giant salvinia (\"Salvinia molesta\") is a serious pest, covering waterways, reducing water flow and harming native species. Control with the salvinia weevil (\"Cyrtobagous salviniae\") and the salvinia stem-borer moth (\"Samea multiplicalis)\" is effective in warm climates, and in Zimbabwe, a 99% control of the weed was obtained over a two-year period.\n\nSmall commercially reared parasitoidal wasps, \"Trichogramma ostriniae\", provide limited and erratic control of the European corn borer (\"Ostrinia nubilalis\"), a serious pest. Careful formulations of the bacterium \"Bacillus thuringiensis\" are more effective.\n\nThe population of \"Levuana iridescens\", the Levuana moth, a serious coconut pest in Fiji, was brought under control by a classical biological control program in the 1920s.\n\nAugmentation involves the supplemental release of natural enemies that occur in a particular area, boosting the naturally occurring populations there. In inoculative release, small numbers of the control agents are released at intervals to allow them to reproduce, in the hope of setting up longer-term control, and thus keeping the pest down to a low level, constituting prevention rather than cure. In inundative release, in contrast, large numbers are released in the hope of rapidly reducing a damaging pest population, correcting a problem that has already arisen. Augmentation can be effective, but is not guaranteed to work, and depends on the precise details of the interactions between each pest and control agent.\n\nAn example of inoculative release occurs in the horticultural production of several crops in greenhouses. Periodic releases of the parasitoidal wasp, \"Encarsia formosa\", are used to control greenhouse whitefly, while the predatory mite \"Phytoseiulus persimilis\" is used for control of the two-spotted spider mite.\n\nThe egg parasite \"Trichogramma\" is frequently released inundatively to control harmful moths. Similarly, \"Bacillus thuringiensis\" and other microbial insecticides are used in large enough quantities for a rapid effect. Recommended release rates for \"Trichogramma\" in vegetable or field crops range from 5,000 to 200,000 per acre (1 to 50 per square metre) per week according to the level of pest infestation. Similarly, nematodes that kill insects (that are entomopathogenic) are released at rates of millions and even billions per acre for control of certain soil-dwelling insect pests.\n\nThe conservation of existing natural enemies in an environment is the third method of biological pest control.\nNatural enemies are already adapted to the habitat and to the target pest, and their conservation can be simple and cost-effective, as when nectar-producing crop plants are grown in the borders of rice fields. These provide nectar to support parasitoids and predators of planthopper pests and have been demonstrated to be so effective (reducing pest densities by 10- or even 100-fold) that farmers sprayed 70% less insecticides and enjoyed yields boosted by 5%. Predators of aphids were similarly found to be present in tussock grasses by field boundary hedges in England, but they spread too slowly to reach the centres of fields. Control was improved by planting a metre-wide strip of tussock grasses in field centres, enabling aphid predators to overwinter there.\n\nCropping systems can be modified to favor natural enemies, a practice sometimes referred to as habitat manipulation. Providing a suitable habitat, such as a shelterbelt, hedgerow, or beetle bank where beneficial insects such as parasitoidal wasps can live and reproduce, can help ensure the survival of populations of natural enemies. Things as simple as leaving a layer of fallen leaves or mulch in place provides a suitable food source for worms and provides a shelter for insects, in turn being a food source for such beneficial mammals as hedgehogs and shrews. Compost piles and stacks of wood can provide shelter for invertebrates and small mammals. Long grass and ponds support amphibians. Not removing dead annuals and non-hardy plants in the autumn allows insects to make use of their hollow stems during winter. In California, prune trees are sometimes planted in grape vineyards to provide an improved overwintering habitat or refuge for a key grape pest parasitoid. The providing of artificial shelters in the form of wooden caskets, boxes or flowerpots is also sometimes undertaken, particularly in gardens, to make a cropped area more attractive to natural enemies. For example, earwigs are natural predators which can be encouraged in gardens by hanging upside-down flowerpots filled with straw or wood wool. Green lacewings can be encouraged by using plastic bottles with an open bottom and a roll of cardboard inside. Birdhouses enable insectivorous birds to nest; the most useful birds can be attracted by choosing an opening just large enough for the desired species.\n\nIn cotton production, the replacement of broad-spectrum insecticides with selective control measures such as Bt cotton can create a more favorable environment for natural enemies of cotton pests due to reduced insecticide exposure risk. Such predators or parasitoids can control pests not affected by the Bt protein. Reduced prey quality and abundance associated increased control from Bt cotton can also indirectly decrease natural enemy populations in some cases, but the percentage of pests eaten or parasitized in Bt and non-Bt cotton are often similar.\n\nPredators are mainly free-living species that directly consume a large number of prey during their whole lifetime. Given that many major crop pests are insects, many of the predators used in biological control are insectivorous species. Lady beetles, and in particular their larvae which are active between May and July in the northern hemisphere, are voracious predators of aphids, and also consume mites, scale insects and small caterpillars. The spotted lady beetle (\"Coleomegilla maculata\") is also able to feed on the eggs and larvae of the Colorado potato beetle (\"Leptinotarsa decemlineata\").\n\nThe larvae of many hoverfly species principally feed upon aphids, one larva devouring up to 400 in its lifetime. Their effectiveness in commercial crops has not been studied.\n\nSeveral species of entomopathogenic nematode are important predators of insect and other invertebrate pests. \"Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita\" is a microscopic nematode that kills slugs. Its complex life cycle includes a free-living, infective stage in the soil where it becomes associated with a pathogenic bacteria such as \"Moraxella osloensis\". The nematode enters the slug through the posterior mantle region, thereafter feeding and reproducing inside, but it is the bacteria that kill the slug. The nematode is available commercially in Europe and is applied by watering onto moist soil.\n\nSpecies used to control spider mites include the predatory mites \"Phytoseiulus persimilis\", \"Neoseilus californicus,\" and \"Amblyseius cucumeris\", the predatory midge \"Feltiella acarisuga\", and a ladybird \"Stethorus punctillum\". The bug \"Orius insidiosus\" has been successfully used against the two-spotted spider mite and the western flower thrips (\"Frankliniella occidentalis\").\n\nPredators including \"Cactoblastis cactorum\" (mentioned above) can also be used to destroy invasive plant species. As another example, the poison hemlock moth (\"Agonopterix alstroemeriana)\" can be used to control poison hemlock (\"Conium maculatum\"). During its larval stage, the moth strictly consumes its host plant, poison hemlock, and can exist at hundreds of larvae per individual host plant, destroying large swathes of the hemlock.\n\nNot all biological control agents are directed at crop pests. For instance, there are both traditional and technological strategies for controlling urban pests. A traditional example comes from the control of mice infestations using cats. For rodent pests, cats are effective biological control when used in conjunction with reduction of \"harborage\"/hiding locations. While cats are effective at preventing rodent \"population explosions\", they are not effective for eliminating pre-existing severe infestations. Barn owls are also sometimes used as biological rodent control. Although there are no quantitative studies of the effectiveness of barn owls for this purpose, they are known rodent predators that can be used in addition to or instead of cats; they can be encouraged into an area with nest boxes.\nSimilarly, there are a number of recent studies pursuing sustainable methods for controlling urban cockroaches using parasitic wasps. Since most cockroaches remain in the sewer system and sheltered areas which are inaccessible to insecticides, employing active-hunter wasps is a strategy to try and reduce their populations. \nParasitoids lay their eggs on or in the body of an insect host, which is then used as a food for developing larvae. The host is ultimately killed. Most insect parasitoids are wasps or flies, and many have a very narrow host range. The most important groups are the ichneumonid wasps, which mainly use caterpillars as hosts; braconid wasps, which attack caterpillars and a wide range of other insects including aphids; chalcid wasps, which parasitize eggs and larvae of many insect species; and tachinid flies, which parasitize a wide range of insects including caterpillars, beetle adults and larvae, and true bugs. Parasitoids are most effective at reducing pest populations when their host organisms have limited refuges to hide from them.\n\nParasitoids are among the most widely used biological control agents. Commercially, there are two types of rearing systems: short-term daily output with high production of parasitoids per day, and long-term, low daily output systems. In most instances, production will need to be matched with the appropriate release dates when susceptible host species at a suitable phase of development will be available. Larger production facilities produce on a yearlong basis, whereas some facilities produce only seasonally. Rearing facilities are usually a significant distance from where the agents are to be used in the field, and transporting the parasitoids from the point of production to the point of use can pose problems. Shipping conditions can be too hot, and even vibrations from planes or trucks can adversely affect parasitoids.\n\n\"Encarsia formosa\" is a small predatory chalcid wasp which is a parasitoid of whitefly, a sap-feeding insect which can cause wilting and black sooty moulds in glasshouse vegetable and ornamental crops. It is most effective when dealing with low level infestations, giving protection over a long period of time. The wasp lays its eggs in young whitefly 'scales', turning them black as the parasite larvae pupate. \"Gonatocerus ashmeadi\" (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae) has been introduced to control the glassy-winged sharpshooter \"Homalodisca vitripennis\" (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) in French Polynesia and has successfully controlled ~95% of the pest density.\n\nThe eastern spruce budworm is an example of a destructive insect in fir and spruce forests. Birds are a natural form of biological control, but the \"Trichogramma minutum\", a species of parasitic wasp, has been investigated as an alternative to more controversial chemical controls.\n\nPathogenic micro-organisms include bacteria, fungi, and viruses. They kill or debilitate their host and are relatively host-specific. Various microbial insect diseases occur naturally, but may also be used as biological pesticides. When naturally occurring, these outbreaks are density-dependent in that they generally only occur as insect populations become denser.\n\nBacteria used for biological control infect insects via their digestive tracts, so they offer only limited options for controlling insects with sucking mouth parts such as aphids and scale insects. \"Bacillus thuringiensis\", a soil-dwelling bacterium, is the most widely applied species of bacteria used for biological control, with at least four sub-species used against Lepidopteran (moth, butterfly), Coleopteran (beetle) and Dipteran (true fly) insect pests. The bacterium is available to organic farmers in sachets of dried spores which are mixed with water and sprayed onto vulnerable plants such as brassicas and fruit trees. Genes from \"B. thuringiensis\" have also been incorporated into transgenic crops, making the plants express some of the bacterium's toxins, which are proteins. These confer resistance to insect pests and thus reduce the necessity for pesticide use. If pests develop resistance to the toxins in these crops, \"B. thuringiensis\" will become useless in organic farming also.\nThe bacterium \"Paenibacillus popilliae\" which causes milky spore disease has been found useful in the control of Japanese beetle, killing the larvae. It is very specific to its host species and is harmless to vertebrates and other invertebrates.\n\nEntomopathogenic fungi, which cause disease in insects, include at least 14 species that attack aphids. \"Beauveria bassiana\" is mass-produced and used to manage a wide variety of insect pests including whiteflies, thrips, aphids and weevils. \"Lecanicillium\" spp. are deployed against white flies, thrips and aphids. \"Metarhizium\" spp. are used against pests including beetles, locusts and other grasshoppers, Hemiptera, and spider mites. \"Paecilomyces fumosoroseus\" is effective against white flies, thrips and aphids; \"Purpureocillium lilacinus\" is used against root-knot nematodes, and 89 \"Trichoderma\" species against certain plant pathogens. \"Trichoderma viride\" has been used against Dutch elm disease, and has shown some effect in suppressing silver leaf, a disease of stone fruits caused by the pathogenic fungus \"Chondrostereum purpureum\".\n\nThe fungi \"Cordyceps\" and \"Metacordyceps\" are deployed against a wide spectrum of arthropods. \"Entomophaga\" is effective against pests such as the green peach aphid.\n\nSeveral members of Chytridiomycota and Blastocladiomycota have been explored as agents of biological control. From Chytridiomycota, \"Synchytrium solstitiale\" is being considered as a control agent of the yellow star thistle (\"Centaurea solstitialis\") in the United States.\n\nBaculoviruses are specific to individual insect host species and have been shown to be useful in biological pest control. For example, the Lymantria dispar multicapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus has been used to spray large areas of forest in North America where larvae of the gypsy moth are causing serious defoliation. The moth larvae are killed by the virus they have eaten and die, the disintegrating cadavers leaving virus particles on the foliage to infect other larvae.\n\nA mammalian virus, the rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus was introduced to Australia to attempt to control the European rabbit populations there. It escaped from quarantine and spread across the country, killing large numbers of rabbits. Very young animals survived, passing immunity to their offspring in due course and eventually producing a virus-resistant population. Introduction into New Zealand in the 1990s was similarly successful at first, but a decade later, immunity had developed and populations had returned to pre-RHD levels.\n\n\"Lagenidium giganteum\" is a water-borne mould that parasitizes the larval stage of mosquitoes. When applied to water, the motile spores avoid unsuitable host species and search out suitable mosquito larval hosts. This mould has the advantages of a dormant phase, resistant to desiccation, with slow-release characteristics over several years. Unfortunately, it is susceptible to many chemicals used in mosquito abatement programmes.\n\nThe legume vine \"Mucuna pruriens\" is used in the countries of Benin and Vietnam as a biological control for problematic \"Imperata cylindrica\" grass: the vine is extremely vigorous and suppresses neighbouring plants by out-competing them for space and light. \"Mucuna pruriens\" is said not to be invasive outside its cultivated area. \"Desmodium uncinatum\" can be used in push-pull farming to stop the parasitic plant, witchweed (\"Striga\").\n\nThe Australian bush fly, \"Musca vetustissima\", is a major nuisance pest in Australia, but native decomposers found in Australia are not adapted to feeding on cow dung, which is where bush flies breed. Therefore, the Australian Dung Beetle Project (1965–1985), led by George Bornemissza of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, released forty-nine species of dung beetle, to reduce the amount of dung and therefore also the potential breeding sites of the fly.\n\nIn cases of massive and severe infection of invasive pests, techniques of pest control are often used in combination. An example is the emerald ash borer, \"Agrilus planipennis\", an invasive beetle from China, which has destroyed tens of millions of ash trees in its introduced range in North America. As part of the campaign against it, from 2003 American scientists and the Chinese Academy of Forestry searched for its natural enemies in the wild, leading to the discovery of several parasitoid wasps, namely \"Tetrastichus planipennisi\", a gregarious larval endoparasitoid, \"Oobius agrili\", a solitary, parthenogenic egg parasitoid, and \"Spathius agrili\", a gregarious larval ectoparasitoid. These have been introduced and released into the United States of America as a possible biological control of the emerald ash borer. Initial results for \"Tetrastichus planipennisi\" have shown promise, and it is now being released along with \"Beauveria bassiana\", a fungal pathogen with known insecticidal properties.\n\nMany of the most important pests are exotic, invasive species that severely impact agriculture, horticulture, forestry and urban environments. They tend to arrive without their co-evolved\nparasites, pathogens and predators, and by escaping from these, populations may soar. Importing the natural enemies of these pests may seem a logical move but this may have unintended consequences; regulations may be ineffective and there may be unanticipated effects on biodiversity, and the adoption of the techniques may prove challenging because of a lack of knowledge among farmers and growers.\n\nBiological control can affect biodiversity through predation, parasitism, pathogenicity, competition, or other attacks on non-target species. An introduced control does not always target only the intended pest species; it can also target native species. In Hawaii during the 1940s parasitic wasps were introduced to control a lepidopteran pest and the wasps are still found there today. This may have a negative impact on the native ecosystem; however, host range and impacts need to be studied before declaring their impact on the environment.\n\nVertebrate animals tend to be generalist feeders, and seldom make good biological control agents; many of the classic cases of \"biocontrol gone awry\" involve vertebrates. For example, the cane toad (\"Rhinella marina\") was intentionally introduced to Australia to control the greyback cane beetle (\"Dermolepida albohirtum\"), and other pests of sugar cane. 102 toads were obtained from Hawaii and bred in captivity to increase their numbers until they were released into the sugar cane fields of the tropic north in 1935. It was later discovered that the toads could not jump very high and so were unable to eat the cane beetles which stayed on the upper stalks of the cane plants. However, the toad thrived by feeding on other insects and soon spread very rapidly; it took over native amphibian habitat and brought foreign disease to native toads and frogs, dramatically reducing their populations. Also, when it is threatened or handled, the cane toad releases poison from parotoid glands on its shoulders; native Australian species such as goannas, tiger snakes, dingos and northern quolls that attempted to eat the toad were harmed or killed. However, there has been some recent evidence that native predators are adapting, both physiologically and through changing their behaviour, so in the long run, their populations may recover.\n\n\"Rhinocyllus conicus\", a seed-feeding weevil, was introduced to North America to control exotic musk thistle (\"Carduus nutans\") and Canadian thistle (\"Cirsium arvense\"). However, the weevil also attacks native thistles, harming such species as the endemic Platte thistle (\"Cirsium neomexicanum\") by selecting larger plants (which reduced the gene pool), reducing seed production and ultimately threatening the species' survival.\n\nThe small Asian mongoose (\"Herpestus javanicus\") was introduced to Hawaii in order to control the rat population. However, the mongoose was diurnal, and the rats emerged at night; the mongoose therefore preyed on the endemic birds of Hawaii, especially their eggs, more often than it ate the rats, and now both rats and mongooses threaten the birds. This introduction was undertaken without understanding the consequences of such an action. No regulations existed at the time, and more careful evaluation should prevent such releases now.\n\nThe sturdy and prolific eastern mosquitofish (\"Gambusia holbrooki\") is a native of the southeastern United States and was introduced around the world in the 1930s and '40s to feed on mosquito larvae and thus combat malaria. However, it has thrived at the expense of local species, causing a decline of endemic fish and frogs through competition for food resources, as well as through eating their eggs and larvae. In Australia, control of the mosquitofish is the subject of discussion; in 1989 researchers A. H. Arthington and L. L. Lloyd stated that \"biological population control is well beyond present capabilities\".\n\nA potential obstacle to the adoption of biological pest control measures is that growers may prefer to stay with the familiar use of pesticides. However, pesticides have undesired effects, including the development of resistance among pests, and the destruction of natural enemies; these may in turn enable outbreaks of pests of other species than the ones originally targeted, and on crops at a distance from those treated with pesticides. One method of increasing grower adoption of biocontrol methods involves letting them learn by doing, for example showing them simple field experiments, enabling them to observe the live predation of pests, or demonstrations of parasitised pests. In the Philippines, early season sprays against leaf folder caterpillars were common practice, but growers were asked to follow a 'rule of thumb' of not spraying against leaf folders for the first 30 days after transplanting; participation in this resulted in a reduction of insecticide use by 1/3 and a change in grower perception of insecticide use.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The concept was born as a way to \"celebrate the beauty, power and resilience of black women\", as described by Julee Wilson from \"HuffPost\", and to congratulate black women on their accomplishments. Referring to a speech made by Michelle Obama at the Black Girls Rock Awards, Thompson explains that black women around the world persevering despite adversity inspired her to spread the concept of Black Girl Magic. With these women in mind, Thompson created the social media hashtag, clothing campaign, and rallying cry \"Black Girl Magic\", in the hopes of counteracting negativity society places on black women.\n\nThough born online, the movement has inspired many organizations across the world to host events using the title. The movement has also seen celebrity support, as singers Corinne Bailey Rae, Janelle Monáe and Solange Knowles have invoked the concept, and ballerina Misty Copeland and President Barack Obama discussed the idea in an interview with Maya Rhodan for \"Time\" and \"Essence\" magazines.\n\nSince being popularized, the concept has also gained traction in cultural criticism, invoked in analysis of music and film. As its usage has grown, the expression has drawn criticism as well as staunch defenders.\n\nIn 2016, poet Mahogany L. Browne created a slam poetry piece entitled \"Black Girl Magic\".\n\nIn 2013, Thompson coined the phrase via the hashtag #BlackGirlsAreMagic— now shortened to #BlackGirlMagic—to create an online dialogue centered around the achievements of black women, in a society that has historically recognized very few of these achievements. Since being popularized, one can find the hashtag being used on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and other social media and mainstream media platforms, celebrating positive messages and images of black women all across the globe.\n\nIn January 2014, Thompson began selling t-shirts sporting the \"Black Girls Are Magic\" logo that she created with her friend. At the time, Thompson only meant to sell these shirts to her friends and family, but has since sold over 3,000 T-shirts through her Teespring account. While the popularity of the shirts started among active social media users, Thompson was quickly surprised to see that people were also buying them as gifts for granddaughters, daughters, and nieces, as they felt that the message was encouraging for young girls too.\n\nThe shirts have also gained some celebrity recognition, with prominent young black women such as Willow Smith and Amandla Stenberg posting pictures of themselves on various social media platforms wearing their Black Girls Are Magic gear.\n\n\"I say 'magic' because it's something that people don't always understand,\" Thompson told \"The Los Angeles Times\". She went on to explain how \"Sometimes our accomplishments might seem to come out of thin air, because a lot of times, the only people supporting us are other black women.\" At its core, the purpose of this movement is to create a platform where women of color can stand together against the stereotyping, colourism, misogynoir and racism that is often their lived experience.\n\nAs its usage has grown, the concept has also drawn criticism.\n\nWhile many black women support the concept of Black Girl Magic, some feel it reinforces the \"strong black woman\" archetype that black women often confront. In an article for Elle Magazine, Linda Chavers argued that the movement suggests that black women are superhuman, or something other than human. She goes on to explain how, historically, black women have been seen and treated as subhuman beings, and how the image of black women persevering despite her suffering, is the epitome of the strong black woman type that is often celebrated while simultaneously being criticized in today's culture.\n\nIn 2016, Black Girl Magic Ltd was established as an nonprofit organization in an attempt to create a legacy and continuity throughout the UK and Europe.\n\n"}
{"id": "145554", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=145554", "title": "Body modification", "text": "Body modification\n\nBody modification (or body alteration) is the deliberate altering of the human anatomy or human physical appearance. It is often done for aesthetics, sexual enhancement, rites of passage, religious beliefs, to display group membership or affiliation, to create body art, for shock value, and as self-expression, among other reasons. In its broadest definition it includes plastic surgery, socially acceptable decoration (\"e.g.\", common ear piercing in many societies), and religious rites of passage (e.g., circumcision in a number of cultures), as well as the modern primitive movement.\n\n\nIn contrast to the explicit ornaments, the following procedures are primarily not meant to be exposed \"per se\", but rather function to augment another part of the body, like the skin in a subdermal implant.\n\n\nGenital modification and mutilation:\n\nNipple cutting:\n\nNullification involves the voluntary removal of body parts. Body parts that are commonly removed by those practicing body nullification are: penis, testicles, clitoris, labia and nipples. Sometimes people who desire a nullification may be diagnosed with gender identity disorder, body integrity identity disorder or apotemnophilia.\n\nTongue cutting:\n\nBody modifications occurring as the end result of long term activities or practices\n\n\n\"Disfigurement\" and \"mutilation\" (regardless of any appreciation this always applies objectively whenever a bodily function is gravely diminished or lost) are terms used by opponents of body modification to describe certain types of modifications, especially non-consensual ones. Those terms are used fairly uncontroversially to describe the victims of torture, who have endured damage to ears, eyes, feet, genitalia, hands, noses, teeth, and/or tongues, including amputation, burning, flagellation, piercing, skinning, and wheeling. \n\nSome surgical procedures that modify human genitals are performed with the informed consent of the patient, using anesthesia. The phrase \"Genital mutilation\" is sometimes used to describe procedures that individuals are forced to undergo without their informed consent, or without anesthesia or sterilised surgical tools. The phrase has been applied to involuntary castration, male circumcision, and female genital mutilation. Intersex campaigners say that childhood modification of genitals of individuals with intersex conditions without their informed consent is a form of mutilation.\n\nMany use body modification and self-mutilation interchangeably. In many ways self-mutilation is very different than body-modification. Body modification gives one the feeling of pride and excitement, giving one something to show off to others. Alternately, those who self-mutilate typically are ashamed of what they've done and want to hide any evidence of harm. Body modification is explored for adornment, self-expression, and an array of many other positive reasons, while self-mutilation is inflicted because of mental or emotional stress and the inability to cope with psychological pain. Those who self-mutilate do so in order to punish themselves, express internal turmoil, and reduce severe anxiety.\n"}

Governments, development agencies, civil society, non-government organizations and the media are but some of the partners working toward reaching these goals.\n\nThe EFA goals also contribute to the global pursuit of the eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), especially MDG 2 on universal primary education and MDG 3 on gender equality in education, by 2015.\n\nThe Fast Track Initiative was set up to implement the EFA movement, aiming at \"accelerating progress towards quality universal primary education\".\n\nUNESCO also produces the annual Education for All Global Monitoring Report. For further information, see UNESCO's website for the Education for All Global Monitoring Report: http://www.unesco.org/en/efareport. This report has been replaced by the Global Education Monitoring Report.\n\nUNESCO works with others around the world to reach a mutual understanding for everyone to work well together. UNESCO coordinates international cooperation which allows access to education, grow and live in a diverse community, learn from advancements in technology, and freedom of expression. This cooperation allows UNESCO to work with others to create opportunities for children and other citizens around the world. Goals are created to provide all children with an elementary education, which is important to some families. Educational programs are also created through the cooperation.\n\nAudrey Azoulay was elected as the Director-General on November 15, 2017 for a four-year term. Azoulay has priorities in place and one of the highest ones is education. Working with others will allow the education programs to spread globally. Azoulay is working hard to make sure all these goals and cooperation are kept in line to help better the present and future for children and other citizens. She believes that these issues faced by countries cannot be met by one country alone, therefore working with different countries will make it more possible to solve these issues and meet goals.\n\nPartnerships is what helps UNESCO fix global challenges. These partnerships are managed very carefully to reassure that the goals set in place are met. UNESCO works in different ways with their partnerships such as collaboration, volunteers, advocacy, and consultations. By having these different ways of working with others, UNESCO is able to have many partnerships and have them globally. UNESCO's partners range from individuals to institutions all around the world. Some of them are governments, Private Sector companies, Goodwill Ambassadors, media organizations, corporate and philanthropic foundations, parliamentarians, the wider UN family, other intergovernmental organizations, specialized networks in UNESCO, and NGOs. \n\nUNESCO offers many entry levels for partnerships, which are organizations that have leadership and goals/priorities set in place to achieve. Some examples of those are education, natural sciences, oceans, social and human sciences, culture, communication and information, priority Africa, and crisis and transition. Education is the top priority for UNESCO and they are working with EFA to create better education for all children and adults. The problem that comes from this is that every country is different and that reflects achieving these education goals. Countries differ in quality of education due to economics and culture. This is where is great need to strengthen in finances, resources, and technology. Technology is booming in this time and that has an effect on how much education students have access to globally. Therefore, those areas need to be strengthen to ensure that education is top priority going into the future.\n\nIn 2000, ten years later, the international community met again at the World Education Forum in Dakar, Senegal, an event which drew 1100 participants. The forum took stock of the fact that many countries were far from having reached the goals established at the World Conference on Education for All in 1990. The participants agreed on the Dakar Framework for Action which re-affirmed their commitment to achieving Education for All by the year 2015, and identified six key measurable education goals which aim to meet the learning needs of all children, youth and adults by 2015. In addition, the forum reaffirmed UNESCO’s role as the lead organization with the overall responsibility of coordinating other agencies and organizations in the attempts to achieve these goals. The six goals established in The Dakar Framework for Action, Education for All: Meeting Our Collective Commitments are:\n\n\nIn order to evaluate each country's progress with regards to the EFA's goals set in the Dakar Framework for Action, UNESCO has developed the Education for All Development Index (EDI). The EDI measures four of the six EFA goals, selected on the basis of data availability. Each of the four goals is evaluated using a specific indicator, and each of those components is then assigned an equal weight in the overall index.\n\nThe EDI value for a given country is thus the arithmetic mean of the four indicators. Since they are all expressed as percentages, the EDI value can vary from 0 to 100% or, when expressed as a ratio, from 0 to 1. The higher the EDI value, the closer the country is to achieving Education For All as a whole.\n\nThe four goals measured in the EDI and their corresponding indicators are:\n\n\nThe \"EFA Global Monitoring Report\" published annually by UNESCO tracks progress on the six education goals. The 2015 review indicates that only a third of countries reached all the goals with measurable targets.\nInclusion is a main component that is used with EFA. Since EFA is a global movement all children are involved: different cultures, religions, disabilities, and more. The problem that is faced with inclusion is how different countries define disability. To be more specific the problem comes with the definition of special needs. This can affect how or if those students can meet the goals that are created. To make sure all children are included schools collaborate to see how all the children can meet the certain goals given. This area may be a challenging one for some and it comes down to what does the term \"all\" really mean in Education For All? That is an answer that will vary country to country and every where around the world. There have been predictions that by the year 2025 the number of children with disabilities will have risen. A majority of that number will be children in developing countries. Therefore, answers are needed on how to include all children in the learning and educational goals set. Similar to technology in schools, inclusion can grow and become more common in schools.\n\nThese goals set by the EFA were not able to be met by all. Some countries were unable to meet these goals due to conflict in the area. Conflicts can cause destruction and prevent children from even going to school or learning from home. There was a fear that certain countries would not be able to gain access to certain technology and support to meet these goals. Technology is a problem that countries run into with trying to improve education for children and even adults. As technology advances it is becoming a bigger key component in some schools. Depending on some areas technology is the central focus point to help students learn. In other areas that may not be the case. If technology keeps advancing that may have different affects on countries. Some may not be able to keep up with the advances and other may be able to keep up. This all goes back to financial stability and economics in each country. One of UNESCO's partners, World Bank worked with the countries that were most likely not going to meet the goals by the deadline (2015). World Bank provided these countries with support and in return they would get certain policy reforms. This allows countries to receive support to help achieve the educational goals. This can be helpful for countries that are less fortunate in financial and economic stability. Some of these countries that struggled were in East Africa: Kenya and Tanzania. When all the countries in East Africa had declared independence, then education became the priority for all. The problem became that those countries struggled with educational on literacy challenges.\n\nThe UNESCO revealed in its 2017 Global Education Monitoring Report that around 264 million youngsters do not attend school. An additional $39 billion is needed annually to enhance the quality of schools worldwide. This will provide 2.2 billion children globally equal access to learning. At present, only 83 percent of students who attend school are able to finish elementary education and a low of 45 percent of kids 15 up to 17 years old complete the secondary level. UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova stated in an official statement that \"\"Education is a shared responsibility between us all: governments, schools, teachers, parents and private actors\".\" Accountability describes how mentors teach, students learn, and bureaucracies take action. The World Bank said in 2017 that millions of learners from different parts of the world in underdeveloped and developing nations are confronted with problems of lost opportunities and low wages since primary as well as secondary schools fail in educating these students properly.\n\n"}

{"id": "12837452", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12837452", "title": "Ilium/Olympos", "text": "Ilium/Olympos\n\nIlium/Olympos is a series of two science fiction novels by Dan Simmons. The events are set in motion by beings who appear to be ancient Greek gods. Like Simmons' earlier series, the Hyperion Cantos, it is a form of \"literary science fiction\"; it relies heavily on intertextuality, in this case with Homer and Shakespeare as well as references to Marcel Proust's \"À la recherche du temps perdu\" (or \"In Search of Lost Time\") and Vladimir Nabokov's novel \"\".\n\nAs with most of his science fiction and in particular with \"Hyperion\", \"Ilium\" demonstrates that Simmons writes in the soft science fiction tradition of Ray Bradbury and Ursula K. Le Guin. \"Ilium\" is based on a literary approach similar to most of Bradbury's work, but describes larger segments of society and broader historical events. As in Le Guin's Hainish series, Simmons places the action of \"Ilium\" in a vast and complex universe made of relatively plausible technological and scientific elements. Yet \"Ilium\" is different from any of the works of Bradbury and Le Guin in its exploration of the very far future of humanity, and in the extra human or post-human themes associated with this. It deals with the concept of technological singularity where technological change starts to occur beyond the ability of humanity to presently predict or comprehend. The first book, \"Ilium\", received the Locus Award for Best Science Fiction novel in 2004.\n\nThe series centers on three main character groups: that of the scholic Hockenberry, Helen and Greek and Trojan warriors from the Iliad; Daeman, Harman, Ada and the other humans of Earth; and the moravecs, specifically Mahnmut the Europan and Orphu of Io. The novels are written in first-person, present-tense when centered on Hockenberry's character, but features third-person, past-tense narrative in all other instances. Much like Simmons' Hyperion where the characters' stories are told over the course of the novels and the actual events serve as a frame, the three groups of characters' stories are told over the course of the novels and their stories do not begin to converge until the end.\n\nThe \"old-style\" humans of Earth exist at what the post-humans claimed would be a stable, minimum herd population of one million. In reality, their numbers are much smaller than that, around 300,000, because each woman is allowed to have only one child. Their DNA incorporates moth genetics which allows sperm-storage and the choice of father-sperm years after sexual intercourse has actually occurred. This reproductive method causes many children not to know their father, as well as helps to break incest taboos in that the firmary, which controls the fertilization, protects against a child of close relatives being born. The old style human never appear any older than about 40 since every twenty years they are physically rejuvenated.\n\nNamed after the roboticist Hans Moravec, they are autonomous, sentient, self-evolving biomechanical organisms that dwell on the Jovian moons. They were seeded throughout the outer Solar System by humans during the Lost Age. Most moravecs are self-described humanists and study Lost Age culture, including literature, television programs and movies.\n\nDead scholars from previous centuries that were rebuilt by the Olympian gods from their DNA. Their duties are to observe the Trojan War and report the discrepancies that occur between it and Homer's \"Iliad\".\n\n\nAs much of the action derives from fiction involving gods and wizards, Simmons rationalises most of this through his use of far-future technology and science, including:\n\n\nWhat follows is a definition of terms that are either used within \"Ilium\" or are related to its science, technology and fictional history:\n\nSimmons references in passing through his novel such historical figures, fictional characters and works as Christopher Marlowe, Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\", Plato, Gollum, the Disney character Pluto, Samuel Beckett, and William Butler Yeats' \"The Second Coming\", among others. As well as referencing these works and figures, he uses others more extensively, shaping his novel by the examples he chooses, such as 9/11 and its effects on the Earth and its nations.\n\n\"Ilium\" is thematically influenced by extropianism, peopled as it is with post-humans of the far future. It therefore continues to explore the theme pioneered by H. G. Wells in \"The Time Machine\", a work which is also referenced several times in Simmons' work. One of the most notable references is when the old woman Savi calls the current people of Earth \"eloi\", using the word as an expression of her disgust of their self-indulgent society, lack of culture and ignorance of their past.\n\n\"Ilium\" also includes allusions to the work of Nabokov. The most apparent of these are the inclusion of Ardis Hall and the names of Ada, Daeman and Marina, all borrowed from \"Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle\". The society that the old-style humans live in also resembles that of Antiterra, a parallel of our Earth circa 19th century, which features a society in which there exists a lack of repression and Christian morality, shown by Daeman's intent to seduce his cousin. Simmons also includes references to Nabokov's fondness for butterflies, such as the butterfly genetics incorporated in the old-style humans and Daeman's enthusiasm as a lepidopterist.\n\nMahnmut of Europa is identified as a Shakespearean scholar as in the first chapter he is introduced where he analyzes Sonnet 116 in order to send it to his correspondent, Orphu of Io, and it is here that Shakespeare's influence on \"Ilium\" begins. Mahnmut's submersible is named \"The Dark Lady\", an allusion to a figure in Shakespeare's sonnets. There is also, of course, \"The Tempest\"s presence in the characters of Prospero, Ariel and Caliban. There are also multiple references to other Shakespeare works and characters such as Falstaff, Henry IV, Part I and \"Twelfth Night\". Shakespeare himself even makes an appearance in a dream to Mahnmut and quotes from Sonnet 31.\n\nProustian memory investigations had a heavy hand in the novel's making, which helps explain why Simmons chose \"Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle\" over something more well-understood of Nabokov's, such as \"Pale Fire\". \"Ada or Ardor\" was written in such a structure as to mimic someone recalling their own memories, a subject which Proust explores in his work \" À la recherche du temps perdu.\" Orphu of Io is more interested in Proust than Mahnmut's Shakespeare, as he considers Proust \"perhaps the ultimate explorer of time, memory, and perception.\"\n\nSimmons' portrayal of Odysseus speaking to the old-style humans at Ardis Hall is also reminiscent of the \"Bible\"s Jesus teaching his disciples. Odysseus is even addressed as \"Teacher\" by one of his listeners in a way reminiscent of Jesus being addressed as \"\"Rabbi\",\" which is commonly translated as \"Teacher\".\n\nIn January 2004, it was announced that the screenplay he wrote for his novels \"Ilium\" and \"Olympos\" would be made into a film by Digital Domain and Barnet Bain Films, with Simmons acting as executive producer. \"Ilium\" is described as an \"epic tale that spans 5,000 years and sweeps across the entire solar system, including themes and characters from Homer's \"The Iliad\" and Shakespeare's \"The Tempest\".\"\n\n\"Ilium\"Locus Award winner, Hugo Award nominee, 2004\n\"Olympos\"Locus Award shortlist, 2006\n"}

{"id": "577320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=577320", "title": "Language revitalization", "text": "Language revitalization\n\nLanguage revitalization, also referred to as language revival or reversing language shift, is an attempt to halt or reverse the decline of a language or to revive an extinct one. Those involved can include parties such as linguists, cultural or community groups, or governments. Some argue for a distinction between language revival (the resurrection of a dead language with no existing native speakers) and language revitalization (the rescue of a \"dying\" language). It has been pointed out that there has only been one successful instance of a complete language revival, that of the Hebrew language, creating a new generation of native speakers without any pre-existing native speakers as a model.\n\nLanguages targeted for language revitalization include those whose use and prominence is severely limited. Sometimes various tactics of language revitalization can even be used to try to revive extinct languages. Though the goals of language revitalization vary greatly from case to case, they typically involve attempting to expand the number of speakers and use of a language, or trying to maintain the current level of use to protect the language from extinction or language death.\n\nReasons for revitalization vary. In recent times alone, it is estimated that more than 2000 languages have already become extinct. The UN estimates that more than half of the languages spoken today have fewer than 10,000 speakers and that a quarter have fewer than 1,000 speakers and that, unless there are some efforts to maintain them, over the next hundred years most of these will become extinct. These figures are often cited as reasons why language revitalization is necessary to preserve linguistic diversity. Culture and identity are also frequently cited reasons for language revitalization, when a language is perceived as a unique \"cultural treasure.\" A community often sees language as a unique part of their culture, connecting them with their ancestors or with the land, making up an essential part of their history and self-image.\n\nLanguage revitalization is also closely tied to the linguistic field of language documentation. In this field, linguists attempt to create full records of a language's grammar, vocabulary, and linguistic features. This practice can often lead to more concern for the revitalization of a specific language on study. Furthermore, the task of documentation is often taken on with the goal of revitalization in mind.\n\nOne of the most important preliminary steps in language revitalization/recovering involves establishing the degree to which a particular language has been “dislocated”. This helps involved parties find the best way to assist or revive the language.\n\nThere are many different theories or models that attempt to lay out a plan for language revitalization. One of these is provided by celebrated linguist Joshua Fishman.\nFishman's model for reviving threatened (or sleeping) languages, or for making them sustainable, consists of an eight-stage process. Efforts should be concentrated on the earlier stages of restoration until they have been consolidated before proceeding to the later stages. The eight stages are:\n\n\nThis model of language revival is intended to direct efforts to where they are most effective and to avoid wasting energy trying to achieve the later stages of recovery when the earlier stages have not been achieved. For instance, it is probably wasteful to campaign for the use of a language on television or in government services if hardly any families are in the habit of using the language.\n\nAdditionally, Tasaku Tsunoda describes a range of different techniques or methods that speakers can use to try to revitalize a language, including techniques to revive extinct languages and maintain weak ones. The techniques he lists are often limited to the current vitality of the language.\n\nHe claims that the immersion method cannot be used to revitalize an extinct or moribund language. In contrast, the master-apprentice method of one-on-one transmission on language proficiency can be used with moribund languages. Several other methods of revitalization, including those that rely on technology such as recordings or media, can be used for languages in any state of viability.\n\nDavid Crystal, in his book \"Language Death\", proposes that language revitalization is more likely to be successful if its speakers\n\nGhil'ad Zuckermann proposes \"Revival Linguistics\" as a new linguistic discipline and paradigm.\nAccording to Zuckermann, \"revival linguistics combines scientific studies of native language acquisition and foreign language learning. After all, language reclamation is the most extreme case of second-language learning. Revival linguistics complements the established area of documentary linguistics, which records endangered languages before they fall asleep.\"\n\nZuckermann proposes that \"revival linguistics changes the field of historical linguistics by, for instance, weakening the family tree model, which implies that a language has only one parent.\"\n\nThere are disagreements in the field of language revitalization as to the degree that revival should concentrate on maintaining the traditional language, versus allowing simplification or widespread borrowing from the majority language.\nZuckermann acknowledges the presence of \"local peculiarities and idiosyncrasies\" but suggests that \"there are linguistic constraints applicable to all revival attempts. Mastering them would help revivalists and first nations' leaders to work more efficiently. For example, it is easier to resurrect basic vocabulary and verbal conjugations than sounds and word order. Revivalists should be realistic and abandon discouraging, counter-productive slogans such as \"Give us authenticity or give us death!\" Nancy Dorian has pointed out that conservative attitudes toward loanwords and grammatical changes often hamper efforts to revitalize endangered languages (as with Tiwi in Australia), and that a division can exist between educated revitalizers, interested in historicity, and remaining speakers interested in locally authentic idiom (as has sometimes occurred with Irish). Some have argued that structural compromise may, in fact, enhance the prospects of survival, as may have been the case with English in the post-Norman period.\n\nOther linguists have argued that when language revitalization borrows heavily from the majority language, the result is a new language, perhaps a creole or pidgin. For example, the existence of \"Neo-Hawaiian\" as a separate language from \"Traditional Hawaiian\" has been proposed, due to the heavy influence of English on every aspect of the revived Hawaiian language. This has also been proposed for Irish, with a sharp division between \"Urban Irish\" spoken by second-language speakers and traditional Irish as spoken as a first language in Gaeltacht areas. Ó Béarra stated: \"...[to] follow the syntax and idiomatic conventions of English, [would be] producing what amounts to little more than English in Irish drag.\" With regard to the then-moribund Manx language, the scholar T. F. O'Rahilly stated, \"When a language surrenders itself to foreign idiom, and when all its speakers become bilingual, the penalty is death.\" Neil McRae has stated that the uses of Scottish Gaelic are becoming increasingly tokenistic, and native Gaelic idiom is being lost in favor of artificial terms created by second-language speakers.\n\nTotal revival of a dead language (in the sense of having no native speakers) into a self-sustaining community of several million first language speakers has happened only once, in the case of the Hebrew language, now the national language of Israel. In this case, there was a unique set of historical and cultural characteristics that facilitated the revival (\"see Revival of the Hebrew language\").\n\nIn a related development, literary languages without native speakers enjoyed great prestige and practical utility as lingua francas, often counting millions of fluent speakers at a time. In many such cases, a decline in the use of the literary language, sometimes precipitous, was later accompanied by a strong renewal. This happened, for example, in the revival of Classical Latin in the Renaissance, and the revival of Sanskrit in the early centuries A.D. An analogous phenomenon in contemporary Arabic-speaking areas is the expanded use of the literary language (Modern Standard Arabic, a form of the Classical Arabic of the 6th century A.D.). This is taught to all educated speakers and is used in radio broadcasts, formal discussions, etc.\n\nIn addition, literary languages have sometimes risen to the level of becoming first languages of very large language communities. An example is standard Italian, which originated as a literary language derived from the language of 13th-century Florence, especially as used by such important Florentine writers as Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio. This language existed for several centuries primarily as a literary vehicle, with few native speakers; even as late as 1861, on the eve of Italian unification, the language only counted about 500,000 speakers, many non-native, out of a total population of c. 22,000,000. The subsequent success of the language has been through conscious development, where speakers of any of the numerous Italian languages were taught standard Italian as a second language and subsequently imparted it to their children, who learned it as a first language. Of course this came at the expense of local Italian languages, most of which are now endangered. Success was enjoyed in similar circumstances by High German, standard Czech, Castilian Spanish and other languages.\n\nThe Ainu language of the indigenous Ainu people of northern Japan is currently moribund, but efforts are underway to revive it. A 2006 survey of the Hokkaido Ainu indicated that only 4.6% of Ainu surveyed were able to converse in or \"speak a little\" Ainu. As of 2001, Ainu was not taught in any elementary or secondary schools in Japan, but was offered at numerous language centres and universities in Hokkaido, as well as at Tokyo's Chiba University.\n\nIn China, the Manchu language is one of the most endangered languages, with speakers only in three small areas of Manchuria remaining. Some enthusiasts are trying to revive the language of their ancestors using available dictionaries and textbooks, and even occasional visits to Qapqal Xibe Autonomous County in Xinjiang, where the related Xibe language is still spoken natively.\n\nIn the Philippines, a variation of Spanish that was primarily based on Mexican Spanish was the \"lingua franca\" of the country since Spanish colonization in 1565 and was an official language alongside Filipino (a standardized form of the Tagalog language) and English until 1987 following a ratification of a new Constitution where it was re-designated as a voluntary language. As a result of its loss as an official language and years of marginalization at the official level during and after American colonization, the use of the Spanish language amongst the overall populace decreased dramatically and became moribund with the remaining native speakers left being mostly elderly people. However, it is currently seeing a slow revival due to past government promotion under the administration of former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. Most notably, Resolution No. 2006-028 reinstated Spanish as a mandatory subject in secondary schools and universities. Results were immediate as the job demand for Spanish speakers had increased since 2008. As of 2010, the \"Instituto Cervantes de Manila\" reported the number of Filipino Hispanophones with native or non-native knowledge at approximately 3 million (including those who speak the native Spanish-based Creole Chavacano). In addition to government efforts, Spanish has also seen a small revival of interest in media thanks to the importing of telenovelas and music from Latin America. \n\nHebrew, once largely a liturgical language, was reestablished as a means of everyday communication by Jews migrating to what is now the State of Israel and the Palestinian territories, starting in the nineteenth century: it is the world's most famous and successful example of language revitalization.\n\nIn Thailand, there exists a Chong language revitalization project which is headed by Suwilai Premsrirat.\n\nThe European colonization of Australia, and the consequent damage sustained by Aboriginal communities, had a catastrophic effect on indigenous languages in the southeast and south of the country, leaving them with no living traditional native speakers. A number of Aboriginal communities in Victoria and elsewhere are now trying to revive these languages. The work is typically directed by a group of elders and other knowledgeable people, with community language workers doing most of the research and teaching. They analyze the data, develop spelling systems and vocabulary and prepare resources. Decisions are made in collaboration. Some communities employ linguists, and there are also linguists who work independently.\n\nOne of the best cases of relative success in language revitalization is the case of Māori also known as \"te reo Māori\". It is the ancestral tongue of the indigenous Māori people of New Zealand and a vehicle for prose narrative, sung poetry, and genealogical recital. The history of the Māori people is taught in \"te reo Māori\" in sacred learning houses through oral transmission. Even after \"te reo Māori\" became a written language, the oral tradition was preserved.\n\nOnce European colonization began, many laws were enacted in order to promote the use of English over \"te reo Māori\" among indigenous people. The Education Ordinance Act of 1847 mandated school instruction in English and established boarding schools to speed up assimilation of Māori youths into European culture. The Native School Act of 1858 forbade \"te reo Māori\" from being spoken in schools. The colonial masters also promoted the use of English in Māori homes, convincing many parents that their children would not get jobs unless they spoke English.\n\nDuring the 1970s, a group of young Māori people, called the Nga Tamatoa, successfully campaigned for Māori to be taught in schools. Also, Kohanga Reo, Māori language preschools, called language nests, were established. The emphasis was on teaching children the language at a young age, a very effective strategy for language learning. The Māori Language Commission was formed in 1987, leading to a number of national reforms aimed at revitalizing \"te reo Māori\". They include media programs broadcast in \"te reo Māori\", undergraduate college programs taught in \"te reo Māori\", and an annual Māori language week. Each iwi, or tribe, created a language planning program catering to its specific circumstances. These efforts have resulted in a steady increase in children being taught in \"te reo Māori\" in schools since 1996, creating a significant number of fluent speakers and making Māori prominent and useful in the people's daily lives. The program has been so successful that similar programs have been based on it. See Māori language revival.\n\nIn Europe, in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the use of both local and learned languages declined as the central governments of the different states imposed their vernacular language as the standard throughout education and official use (this was the case in the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Italy and Greece, and to some extent, in Germany and Austria-Hungary).\n\nIn the last few decades, local nationalism and human rights movements have made a more multicultural policy standard in European states; sharp condemnation of the earlier practices of suppressing regional languages was expressed in the use of such terms as \"linguicide\". Campaigns have raised the profiles of local languages to such an extent that in some European regions, the local languages have acquired the status of official languages, along with the national language. The Council of Europe's action in this area (see European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages) is in contrast to the European Union's granting of official status to a restricted number of official languages (see Languages of the European Union). Presently, official attempts to revitalise languages under threat, such as the promotion of Welsh, Galician, Basque and Catalan in their respective native regions, have seen varying degrees of success.\n\nOne of the best known European attempts at language revitalization concerns the Irish language. While English is dominant through most of Ireland, Irish, a Celtic language, is still spoken in certain areas called \"Gaeltachtaí\", but there it is in serious decline. The challenges faced by the language over the last few centuries have included exclusion from important domains, social denigration, the death or emigration of many Irish speakers during the Irish famine of the 1840s, and continued emigration since. Efforts to revitalise Irish were being made, however, from the mid-1800s, and were associated with a desire for Irish political independence. Contemporary Irish language revitalization has chiefly involved teaching Irish as a compulsory language in mainstream English-speaking schools. But the failure to teach it in an effective and engaging way means (as linguist Andrew Carnie notes) that students do not acquire the fluency needed for the lasting viability of the language, and this leads to boredom and resentment. Carnie also noted a lack of media in Irish (2006), though this is no longer the case.\n\nThe decline of the Gaeltachtaí and the failure of state-directed revitalisation have been countered by an urban revival movement. This is largely based on an independent community-based school system, known generally as Gaelscoileanna. These schools teach entirely through Irish and their number is growing, with over thirty such schools in Dublin alone. They are an important element in the creation of a network of urban Irish speakers (known as Gaeilgeoirí), who tend to be young, well-educated and middle-class. It is now likely that this group has acquired critical mass, a fact reflected in the expansion of Irish-language media. Irish language television has enjoyed particular success. It has been argued that they tend to be better educated than monolingual English speakers and enjoy higher social status. They represent the transition of Irish to a modern urban world, with an accompanying rise in prestige.\n\nThere are also current attempts to revive the related language of Scottish Gaelic, which was suppressed following the formation of the United Kingdom, and entered further decline due to the Highland clearances. Currently, Gaelic is only spoken widely on the Western Isles and some areas of the Highland and Islands. The decline in fluent Gaelic speakers has slowed, however the population center has shifted to L2 speakers in urban areas, especially Glasgow.\n\nAnother Celtic language, Manx, lost its last native speaker in 1974 and was declared extinct by UNESCO in 2009, but never completely fell from use. The language is now taught in primary and secondary schools including the Bunscoill Ghaelgagh, used in some public events and spoken as a second language by approximately 1800 people. Revitalization efforts include radio shows in Manx Gaelic and social media and online resources. The Manx government has also been involved in the effort by creating organizations such as the Manx Heritage Foundation (also known as Culture Vannin) and the position of Manx Language Officer. The government has released an official Manx Language Strategy for 2017-2021.\n\nThere have been a number of attempts to revive the Cornish language, both privately and some under the Cornish Language Partnership. Some of the activities have included translation of the Christian scriptures, a guild of bards, and the promotion of Cornish literature in modern Cornish, including novels and poetry.\n\nIn recent years, a growing number of Native American tribes have been trying to revitalize their languages. For example, there is an Apple iPhone/iPod app for the Halq'emeylem language of the Greater Vancouver region of Canada. In addition, there are apps (including phrases, word lists and dictionaries) in many Native languages ranging from Cree, Cherokee and Chickasaw, to Lakota, Ojibway and Oneida, Massachusett, Navajo and Gwych'in.\n\nWampanoag, a language spoken by the people of the same name in Massachusetts, underwent a revitalization project led by Jessie Little Doe Baird. The project has seen children speaking the language fluently for the first time in over 100 years. In addition, there are currently attempts at revitalizing the Chochenyo language of California, which had become extinct.\n\nKichwa is the variety of the Quechua language spoken in Ecuador and is one of the most widely spoken indigenous languages in South America. Despite this fact, Kichwa is a threatened language, mainly because of the expansion of Spanish in South America. One community of original Kichwa speakers, Lagunas, was one of the first indigenous communities to switch to the Spanish language. According to King, this was because of the increase of trade and business with the large Spanish-speaking town nearby. The Lagunas people assert that it was not for cultural assimilation purposes, as they value their cultural identity highly. However, once this contact was made, language for the Lagunas people shifted through generations, to Kichwa and Spanish bilingualism and now is essentially Spanish monolingualism. The feelings of the Lagunas people present a dichotomy with language use, as most of the Lagunas members speak Spanish exclusively and only know a few words in Kichwa.\n\nThe prospects for Kichwa language revitalization are not promising, as parents depend on schooling for this purpose, which is not nearly as effective as continual language exposure in the home. Schooling in the Lagunas community, although having a conscious focus on teaching Kichwa, consists of mainly passive interaction, reading, and writing in Kichwa. In addition to grassroots efforts, national language revitalization organizations, like CONAIE, focus attention on non-Spanish speaking indigenous children, who represent a large minority in the country. Another national initiative, Bilingual Intercultural Education Project (PEBI), was ineffective in language revitalization because instruction was given in Kichwa and Spanish was taught as a second language to children who were almost exclusively Spanish monolinguals.\nAlthough some techniques seem ineffective, Kendall A. King provides several suggestions:\n\n\nSpecific suggestions include imparting an elevated perception of the language in schools, focusing on grassroots efforts both in school and the home, and maintaining national and regional attention.\n\nJohn McWhorter has argued that programs to revive indigenous languages will almost never be very effective because of the practical difficulties involved. He also argues that the death of a language does not necessarily mean the death of a culture. Indigenous expression is still possible even when the original language has disappeared, as with Native American groups and as evidenced by the vitality of black American culture in the United States, among people who speak not Yoruba but English. He argues that language death is, ironically, a sign of hitherto isolated peoples migrating and sharing space: “To maintain distinct languages across generations happens only amidst unusually tenacious self-isolation—such as that of the Amish—or brutal segregation”.\n\nKenan Malik has also argued that it is \"irrational\" to try to preserve all the world's languages, as language death is natural and in many cases inevitable, even with intervention. He proposes that language death improves communication by ensuring more people speak the same language. This may benefit the economy and reduce conflict. Others have pointed out that similarities in language and culture have not prevented brutal civil wars.\n\nThe protection of minority languages from extinction is often not a concern for speakers of the dominant language. Often times, there is prejudice and deliberate persecution of minority languages, in order to appropriate the cultural and economic capital of minority groups. At other times governments deem that the cost of revitalization programs and creating linguistically diverse materials is too great to take on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "39995742", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39995742", "title": "Languages of the Roman Empire", "text": "Languages of the Roman Empire\n\nLatin and Greek were the official languages of the Roman Empire, but other languages were important regionally. Latin was the original language of the Romans and remained the language of imperial administration, legislation, and the military throughout the classical period. In the West it became the lingua franca and came to be used for even local administration of the cities including the law courts. After all freeborn inhabitants of the Empire were universally enfranchised in 212 AD, a great number of Roman citizens would have lacked Latin, though they were expected to acquire at least a token knowledge, and Latin remained a marker of \"Romanness\".\n\nKoine Greek had become a shared language around the eastern Mediterranean and diplomatic communications in the East even beyond the borders of the Empire. The international use of Greek was one condition that enabled the spread of Christianity, as indicated for example by the choice of Greek as the language of the New Testament in the Bible and its use for the ecumenical councils of the Christian Roman Empire rather than Latin. With the dissolution of the Empire in the West, Greek became the dominant language of the Roman Empire in the East, modernly referred to as the Byzantine Empire.\n\nBecause communication in ancient society was predominantly oral, it can be difficult to determine the extent to which regional or local languages continued to be spoken or used for other purposes under Roman rule. Some evidence exists in inscriptions, or in references in Greek and Roman texts to other languages and the need for interpreters. For Punic, Coptic, and Aramaic or Syriac, a significant amount of epigraphy or literature survives. The Celtic languages were widespread throughout much of western Europe, and while the orality of Celtic education left scant written records, Celtic epigraphy is limited in quantity but not rare. The Germanic languages of the Empire have left next to no inscriptions or texts, with the exception of Gothic. Multilingualism contributed to the \"cultural triangulation\" by means of which an individual who was neither Greek nor Roman might construct an identity through the processes of Romanization and Hellenization.\n\nAfter the decentralization of political power in late antiquity, Latin developed locally in the Western provinces into branches that became the Romance languages, including Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Italian. In the early 21st century, the first or second language of more than a billion people derived from Latin. Latin itself remained an international medium of expression for diplomacy and for intellectual developments identified with Renaissance humanism up to the 17th century, and for law and the Roman Catholic Church to the present.\n\nLatin was the language of the Romans from the earliest known period. Writing under the first Roman emperor Augustus, Virgil emphasizes that Latin was a source of Roman unity and tradition. In Virgil's epic \"Aeneid\" about the founding of Rome, the supreme deity Jupiter dictates that the refugee Trojans who have come to settle in Italy will use the language of the native Latini as a means of unification: \"they will keep the speech \"(sermo)\" and \"mores\" of their fathers ... and I will make them all Latins with one mode of expression\" \"(uno ore,\" literally \"with one mouth\"). The Julio-Claudian emperors, who claimed descent from the Virgilian hero Aeneas, encouraged high standards of correct Latin \"(Latinitas)\", a linguistic movement identified in modern terms as Classical Latin, and favored Latin for conducting official business.\n\nLatin became the language of conquered areas because local people started speaking it, and not because the population was displaced by Latin-speakers. Latin was not imposed officially on peoples brought under Roman rule. Saint Augustine observed that Romans preferred for Latin to be adopted \"per pacem societatis\", through a social pact. This language policy contrasts with that of Alexander, who aimed to impose Greek throughout his empire as the official language. Latin was not a requirement for Roman citizenship, and there was no state-supported schooling that privileged it as the medium for education: fluency was desirable for its \"high cultural, political, legal, social and economic value\".\n\nLatin was needed for Imperial service and advancement, and was the language used for the internal functioning of government. Edicts and official communications of the emperor were in Latin, including rulings on local laws that might be in another language.\n\nThe Romans placed a high value on the written word, as indicated by their obsession with documentation and public inscriptions. The Imperial bureaucracy was so dependent on writing that the Babylonian Talmud declared \"if all seas were ink, all reeds were pen, all skies parchment, and all men scribes, they would be unable to set down the full scope of the Roman government's concerns.\" Estimates of the average literacy rate in the Empire range from 5 to 30 percent or higher, depending in part on the definition of \"literacy\". The lack of state intervention in access to education was a barrier to literacy, since formal education was available only to children from families who could pay for it.\nThe birth certificates and wills of Roman citizens had to be written in Latin until the time of Alexander Severus (reigned 222–235). Illiterate Roman subjects would have someone such as a government scribe \"(scriba)\" read or write their official documents for them. Laws and edicts were posted in writing as well as read out. Public art and religious ceremonies were ways to communicate imperial ideology regardless of language spoken or ability to read. An early form of story ballet \"(pantomimus)\" was brought to Rome by Greek performers and became popular throughout the multilingual Empire in part because it relied on gesture rather than verbal expression.\n\nLatin was the official language of the Roman army until the mid-6th century, and remained the most common language for military use even in the Eastern empire until the 630s. By contrast, only two bishops are known to have spoken Latin at the ecumenical councils held during the reign of Theodosius II (d. 450 AD).\n\nKoine Greek had become the common language of the eastern Mediterranean and into Asia Minor after the conquests of Alexander the Great. Lucian even imagines that Greek is the universal language of the dead in the underworld. In late antiquity, a Greek-speaking majority lived in the Greek peninsula and islands, major cities of the East, western Anatolia, and some coastal areas. Greek continued as the language of the Eastern Roman Empire, and developed into a distinctive medieval Greek that gave rise to modern Greek.\nThe emperor Claudius tried to limit the use of Greek, and on occasion revoked the citizenship of those who lacked Latin. Even in addressing the Roman Senate, however, he drew on his own bilingualism in communicating with Greek-speaking ambassadors. Suetonius quotes him as referring to \"our two languages,\" and the employment of two imperial secretaries, one for Greek and one Latin, dates to his reign.\n\nThe everyday interpenetration of the two languages is indicated by bilingual inscriptions, which sometimes even switch back and forth between Greek and Latin. The epitaph of a Greek-speaking soldier, for instance, might be written primarily in Greek, with his rank and unit in the Roman army expressed in Latin.\n\nIn the Eastern empire, laws and official documents were regularly translated into Greek from Latin. Both languages were in active use by government officials and the Church during the 5th century. From the 6th century, Greek culture was studied in the West almost exclusively through Latin translation. Latin loanwords appear liberally in Greek texts on technical topics from late antiquity and the Byzantine period.\n\nAtticism was a trend of the Second Sophistic. Intellectuals such as Aelius Aristides sought to restore the standards of classical Greek characteristic of the Attic dialect, represented by Thucydides, Plato, Demosthenes, and other authors from the Classical period. Prose stylists who aspired to Atticism tried to avoid the vulgarisms of koine—an impractical goal, but this linguistic purism also reflected the 2nd-century flourishing of grammarians and lexicographers. Expertise in language and literature contributed to preserving Hellenic culture in the Roman Imperial world.\n\nAmong other reforms, the emperor Diocletian (reigned 284–305) sought to renew the authority of Latin, and the Greek expression ἡ κρατοῦσα διάλεκτος \"(hē kratousa dialektos)\" attests to the continuing status of Latin as \"the language of power.\" The scholar Libanius (4th century) regarded Latin as causing a decline in the quality of Greek rhetoric. In the early 6th century, the emperor Justinian engaged in a quixotic effort to reassert the status of Latin as the language of law, even though in his time Latin no longer held any currency as a living language in the East.\n\nThe dominance of Latin and Greek among the literate elite may obscure the continuity of spoken languages, since all cultures within the Roman Empire were predominantly oral. In areas where Syriac, Coptic, Hebrew and Aramaic were spoken, they coexisted with Greek.\n\nAramaic was the primary language of Syria and Mesopotamia, with several dialects. Syriac was in use around Antioch, one of the three largest cities of the Empire, and particularly by Christians. Syriac literature is known from the latter 2nd century, spreading from the Christian community in Edessa. Early Syriac literature was produced in a largely Greek intellectual milieu until the 4th century, but was distinctive for its use of rich symbolism and emphasis on verse forms, and influenced Greek writers such as Eusebius, Basil and Theodoret. Among the earliest Syriac literature was the \"Diatessaron\" of Tatian, and translations of sections from the Bible.\n\nThe prolific Syrian scholar Bardesanes knew Greek and sent his son for schooling in Athens, but chose to write in his ethnic language. In addition to Syriac homilies and treatises, Bardesanes wrote 150 hymns \"of enormous influence and doubtful doctrine\". Other Syriac literature of the time included Christian treatises, dialogues, and apocryphal Acts. Some Syriac literature had Gnostic elements, and also played a role in the dissemination of Manicheanism. From the 5th century onward, it included Monophysite and Nestorian writings.\n\nWorks by the Syriac writer Ephraim were translated into Greek. The satirist and rhetorician Lucian came from Samosata in the province of Syria; although he wrote in Greek, he calls himself a Syrian, and a reference to himself as a \"barbarian\" suggests that he spoke Syriac.\n\nSoldiers from Palmyra even used their dialect of Aramaic for inscriptions, in a striking exception to the rule that Latin was the language of the military.\n\n\"Coptic\" is the modern term for the form of ancient Egyptian that had developed in late antiquity. Written Coptic as a literary language seems to have resulted from a conscious effort among Egypt's educated class to revive their cultural heritage.\n\nIn the 4th century, Coptic script—based on the Greek alphabet with additional characters from Egyptian demotic to reflect Egyptian phonology—is found in documents in several dialects, including Old Bohairic, Fayumic, Achmimic, and Sahidic. At this time Coptic emerged as a fully literary language, including major translations of Greek scriptures, liturgical texts, and patristic works. From the 4th to 7th centuries, original works—including homilies, saints' lives, monastic rules, letters, and exhortations—were composed in Coptic, primarily in the Sahidic dialect. As a writing system, Coptic was used for everyday purposes such as inventories and real estate transactions, as well as for poetry. By the 640s, when Egypt came under Arab rule, Coptic-speaking Christians constituted the majority of the population. At the end of the 7th century, legal texts might still be written in Coptic: in one example, a bilingual Greek-Arabic protocol with a reference to Mohammed precedes a document entirely in Coptic that invokes the Trinity.\n\nPunic, the Semitic language of the Carthaginians, continued to be used in North Africa during the Imperial period. Before the Roman conquest in 146 BC, nearly all Punic inscriptions had been votives to the deities Tanit and Ba'al or funerary commemorations, but during the Roman era a broader range of content is found in Neo-Punic, often appearing with parallel texts in Latin or Greek. A striking occurrence of Neo-Punic is found at the otherwise thoroughly Roman temple of Roma and Augustus, built 14–19 AD at Leptis Magna. One of the latest Neo-Punic inscriptions on a monument dates to the reign of Domitian (81–96 AD). No inscription in Punic script on stone can be dated later than the 2nd or 3rd century. Latin script was used to write Punic in the 4th and 5th centuries.\n\nPunic was spoken at the highest level of society: the emperor Septimius Severus (reigned 193–211) was born in Leptis Magna and spoke Punic as well as Latin and Greek, while his sister supposedly had little command of Latin at all. Augustine, who was from North Africa, several times mentions Punic; he observed that it was related to Hebrew and Syriac, and his knowledge of Punic helped him figure out transliterated Semitic words from the Bible.\n\nCeltic languages at the beginning of the Imperial period include Gaulish, spoken in Gaul (\"Gallia,\" present-day France, Belgium, Switzerland and northern Italy); Celtiberian, in parts of Hispania (Spain and Portugal); Brittonic in Britannia (Roman Britain), and Galatian, a branch of Celtic brought to Anatolia by the Gallic invasions of the 3rd century BC. The place name Galatia, a Roman province, derives from the Greek word for \"Gauls\" or \"Celts\", \"Galatai\". Loanwords from Gaulish are recorded in Latin as early as the time of Ennius (ca. 239–169 BC), due to the presence of Celtic settlements on the Italian peninsula. By late antiquity, some Gaulish words had become so Latinized that their origin was no longer recognized as such.\nCeltiberian is documented as a written language only after contact with the Romans in the 2nd century BC. Of 103 Celtiberian inscriptions, thirty in Iberian script are hospitality tokens \"(tesserae hospitales)\", twenty of which are in the shape of animals. The social custom of pledging mutual support among families or communities was compatible with \"hospitium\" in Roman culture, and the Celtiberians continued to produce the tokens, though switching to Latin, into the 2nd century of the Imperial era. Under Augustus, the territory of the Celtiberians became part of the Tarraconensis province. Written Celtiberian ceases early in the reign of Augustus, if not before.\n\nSeveral references to Gaulish in late antiquity may indicate that it continued to be spoken. Irenaeus, bishop of Lugdunum (present-day Lyon) from 177 AD, complains that he has to communicate with his parishioners in their \"barbarous tongue\", probably Gaulish. The jurist Ulpian (170–228) mentions the need to recognize Gaulish verbal contracts. Lampridius says that a druidess made a prophecy in Gaulish to Alexander Severus (208–235). Jerome (331–420), who had first-hand knowledge, observes that the Gallic Treveri speak a language \"more or less the same\" as that of the Galatians. The collection of pharmacological recipes by Marcellus of Bordeaux (late 4th- or early 5th-century) contains several Gaulish words, mainly plant names, and seems to indicate that the language remained in use for at least some purposes such as traditional medicine and magic. Sulpicius Severus (363–425), also from Gallia Aquitania, takes note of Gaulish-Latin bilingualism, with Gaulish as the first language. Other mentions of people who speak \"in the Gallic manner\" \"(gallice)\" or similar may refer to speaking Latin with a regional Gaulish accent.\nMuch of historical linguistics scholarship postulates that Gaulish was indeed still spoken as late as the mid to late 6th century in France. Despite considerable Romanization of the local material culture, the Gaulish language is held to have survived and had coexisted with spoken Latin during the centuries of Roman rule of Gaul.\n\nNext to nothing is recorded of the Germanic languages spoken in the Empire, with the exception of Gothic. A phrase of Gothic is quoted in an elegiac couplet from the \"Latin Anthology\", and more substantially parts of the Gospels were translated into Gothic and preserved by the 6th-century Codex Argenteus. While Latin gained some Germanic loanwords, most linguistic influence ran the other way.\nBilingualism in a Germanic language and Latin was especially important in the military for officers in command of units recruited from Germanic-speaking areas. Tacitus observes that Arminius, the Cheruscan officer who later led a disastrously successful rebellion against the Romans, was bilingual. The emperor Julian employed a bilingual Germanic military tribune as a spy. The officers and secretaries who kept the records preserved in the Vindolanda tablets were Batavian, but their Latin contains no hint; the common soldiers of their units, however, may have retained their Germanic speech. Less commonly, Latin-speaking officers learned a Germanic language through their service and acted as interpreters. Acquiring Germanic might be regarded as a dubious achievement inducing anxieties of \"barbarism\": in 5th-century Gaul, Sidonius thinks it funny that his learned friend Syagrius has become fluent in Germanic.\n\nTrilingualism was perhaps not uncommon among educated people who came from regions where a language other than Latin or Greek was spoken. The Latin novelist Apuleius also wrote in Greek, and had learned Punic from his mother. The Babatha Archive is a suggestive example of practical multilingualism. These papyri, named for a Jewish woman in the province of Arabia and dating from 93 to 132 AD, mostly employ Aramaic, the local language, written in Greek characters with Semitic and Latin influences; a petition to the Roman governor, however, was written in Greek.\n\nOne striking example of multilingualism as well as multiculturalism in the Empire is a 2nd-century epitaph for a woman named Regina, discovered in 1878 near the Roman fort at South Shields, northeast England. The inscription is written in Latin and Palmyrene Aramaic, the language of Regina's husband, Barates, who has been identified with a standardbearer \"(vexillarius)\" of that name from Palmyra, Syria. He was most likely in the military stationed along Hadrian's Wall. The Latin, however, is constructed grammatically in the manner of Greek honorific inscriptions typical of Palmyra, suggesting that Barates was bilingual in Aramaic and Greek, and added Latin as a third language. The Latin portion is larger and longer, and provides most of the information. The Palmyrene is carved in a fluid cursive script, and conveys only the name of Regina and an expression of grief. Since few people in Britain could have read Palmyrene, its use may be Barates' personal statement of his identity and emotions. A fourth linguistic element is the name \"Regina\", which can be either Latin or Celtic. Such names seem often to have been chosen for their deliberate duality. Regina herself is identified as from the British Catuvellauni, a people whose \"civitas\" capital was Verulamium, but the Gallo-Brittonic spelling \"Catuallauna\" (feminine) is used in the Latin inscription.\n\nIn Italy, the written use of Latin had replaced Oscan—like Latin, an Italic language—and Etruscan by the end of the 1st century AD. Oscan graffiti are preserved by the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 AD at Pompeii, which was in the Oscan region, and a couple may date after the earlier eruption in 63. In the mid-1st century, the emperor Claudius, who had keen antiquarian interests, knew Etruscan and wrote a multivolume history of the Etruscans, but the work has not survived.\n\nMultilingualism had been characteristic of Sicily for centuries, resulting from occupations by the Carthaginians, Greeks, and Romans. While the slave trade during the Republican period brought speakers of Greek and other languages from the East to the island, Greek was the language of higher-status persons such as government officials and businessmen during the Imperial era. Immigration to Sicily in the early Empire originated more often in places where Latin was spoken than in Greek-speaking areas. African speakers of Latin were a significant presence in Sicily. Christian inscriptions are far more likely to be in Greek. In late antiquity, Greek-Latin bilingualism was common enough that it would have been acquired through everyday personal interaction. The Jewish communities of Syracuse seem to have been bilingual in Greek and Hebrew. There is some Sicilian evidence of Syriac.\n\nIn the Western Empire, Latin gradually replaced the Celtic languages, which were related to it by a shared Indo-European origin. Commonalities in syntax and vocabulary facilitated the adoption of Latin. Mediterranean Gaul (southern France) had become trilingual (Greek, Latin, Gaulish) by the mid-1st century BC. The importance of Latin in gaining access to the ruling power structure caused the rapid extinction of inscriptions in scripts that had been used to represent local languages on the Iberian peninsula \"(Hispania)\" and in Gaul. Among other aspects of a distinctive Gallo-Roman culture was the creation of Gallo-Latin text. In Latin commemorative inscriptions, individuals with Celtic names rarely identify themselves as \"Celtic\" or \"Gallic\"; they are much more likely to name the people of their \"civitas\" (such as Aedui, Remi, Pictones) or their voting tribe \"(tribus)\" as Roman citizens. Several major writers of Latin came from the Iberian peninsula in the Imperial period, including Seneca, Lucan, Quintilian, Martial, and Prudentius. However despite acquisition of Latin, Gaulish is held by some to have held on quite a long time, lasting at least until the middle of the 6th century CE, despite considerable Romanization in the local material culture. \n\nMost of the 136 Greek inscriptions from Mediterraean Gaul (the Narbonensis), including those from originally Greek colonies, are post-Augustan. Their content indicates that Greek was used increasingly for specialized purposes: \"education, medicine, acting, agonistic activities, art, magic, religion, including Christianity\". Inscriptions from Marseilles (ancient Massilia), founded as a Greek Phocaean colony around 600 BC, show the continued use of Greek, especially in education and medicine, into the 2nd and 3rd centuries of the Imperial era. In the 4th century, the Latin poet and scholar Ausonius, from Gallia Aquitania (present-day Bordeaux), characterizes his physician father as speaking Attic Greek with more eloquence than Latin.\n\nBasque, not an Indo-European language, survived in the region of the Pyrenees. The people of southwestern Gaul and northeastern Hispania (roughly present-day Aquitaine and Navarre) were regarded by Julius Caesar as ethnically distinct from the Celts, and the Aquitanian language they spoke was Vasconic like Basque, judging from place names. The Aquitani adopted Latin under Roman rule.\n\nGaulish was probably spoken in central and northern parts of Gaul into the 4th and possibly 5th century, and in Brittany (ancient Aremorica) perhaps into the 6th. Latin did not become as deeply entrenched in the province of Britannia, and may have dwindled rapidly after the Roman withdrawal around 410 AD, although pockets of Latin-speaking Britons survived in western Britain until about 700 AD. The evidence of Latin loanwords into Brittonic suggests that the Latin of Roman Britain was academic, in contrast to the everyday conversational Latin (\"Vulgar\" Latin) on the continent.\n\nIn the provinces of Africa westwards of Cyrenaica (a region colonised by Greeks since the 7th century BC), the people of Carthage and other Phoenician colonies spoke and wrote Punic, with Latin common in urban centers. Other Roman Africans spoke Afroasiatic languages (Libyan, Numidian), debatably early versions of Berber.\n\nPunic was used for legends on coins during the time of Tiberius (1st century AD), and Punic inscriptions appear on public buildings into the 2nd century, some bilingual with Latin. Inscriptions might also be trilingual: one pertaining to Imperial cult presents \"the official Latin, the local Punic, and the Greek of passing traders and an educated or cosmopolitan elite\".\n\nInscriptions in Libyan use a script similar to \"tifinagh\", usually written vertically from the bottom up. The 23 characters are \"of a rather rigid geometric form\". Bilingual examples are found with either Punic or Latin, and indicate that some people who could write these languages could also at least transliterate their names into the Libyan script. Although Libyan inscriptions are concentrated southeast of Hippo, near the present-day Algerian-Tunisia border, their distribution overall suggests that knowledge of the language was not confined to isolated communities.\n\nNotable writers of Latin from Africa during the Imperial period include the novelist Apuleius, and the Church Fathers Tertullian and Augustine. Latin-speaking communities remained in North Africa, particularly around Carthage, during the period of the Vandal Kingdom (435–534), but died out by the late 7th century, with the Arab conquest.\n\nIn Egypt, Coptic predominated, but Greek had been in use since the conquest of Alexander, and Latin and Greek were the administrative languages during the Roman Imperial period. Alexandria, founded in 331 BC under Greek rule and one of the three largest cities of the Roman Empire, was a leading city in Greek intellectual life during the Hellenistic and Imperial periods. Famed for the Library of Alexandria, it was also a center for the dissemination of Christianity, which spread first among Greek speakers in Egypt.\n\nAround 700 AD, Greek was replaced for administrative use by Arabic, the language of the conquerors. Coptic began to decline, and from this point was preserved mainly for liturgical purposes.\n\nAlthough Greek was in common use around the Mediterranean and into Asia Minor even beyond Imperial borders, linguistic distribution in the eastern part of the Empire was complex. Now-extinct languages in Anatolia included Galatian (the form of Celtic introduced by invading Gauls in the 3rd century BC), Phrygian, Pisidian, and Cappadocian, attested by Imperial-era inscriptions. Christian sources also mention the survival of Galatian, Cappadocian, Mysian, and Isaurian in Asia Minor. Like Greek and Latin, these are categorized as Indo-European. Phrygian is not named as a language in a literary text until the 6th century, but is preserved in about a hundred funerary inscriptions in Greek script, most accompanied by Greek text as well and dating from the 3rd century. A Cappadocian accent in speaking Greek seems to be mentioned in a few sources.\nOutside the military, Latin never became the language of everyday life in the East. An exception was the Roman colony of Berytus (present-day Beirut), where a Latin education could be obtained, and which became famous for its school of Roman law.\n\nThe Danubian provinces lay within a geographical area encompassing the middle and lower Danube basins, the Eastern Alps, the Dinarides, and the Balkans. Provinces in this general region include Noricum, Dacia, Dalmatia, Moesia, Thrace, Scythia, and Pannonia. \nThe relative influence of Latin versus Greek and vice versa in this area and in the Balkans in general, is sometimes demarcated by the Jireček Line.\n\nGreek had been in use in the southern part of the Balkans since the late 4th century BC, as a result of the Macedonian conquests of Philip and Alexander. The ancient Macedonian language, perhaps a Greek dialect, may have been spoken in some parts of what is now Macedonia and northern Greece; to the north of this area, Paeonian would have been used, and to the south Epirot, both scantily attested.\n\nIllyrian was spoken in the northwest, and to the northeast Thracian and Dacian. These three languages, all Indo-European, are sometimes thought to be earlier forms of Albanian. From his exile in Tomis on the Black Sea (present-day Constanța, Romania), the Augustan poet Ovid learned Getic and Sarmatian, and noted that Greek was spoken with a markedly Getic accent. Inscriptions from Tomis in the Imperial period are generally Greek, with Thracian personal names and religious references.\n\nInscriptions in Greek and Latin set up by Jews attest to Jewish bi- or multilingualism, and their distribution in the Empire reflects the Jewish diaspora. These may have the Hebrew tag \"shalom\" at the end. Evidence for Jews in Egypt is preserved by papyri until the Jewish revolt of 116–117. In the first half of the 5th century, Greek coexisted with Hebrew and Jewish Aramaic in the Jewish communities of Palaestina Prima and Secunda, and is found in mosaic inscriptions even in synagogues.\n\nLike the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible that predated the Imperial era, Jewish literature in Greek under the Empire was written mainly for Jews who spoke Greek. Some Jews writing in Greek during the late Hellenistic and early Imperial period—notably the philosopher Philo and the historian Josephus—included gentiles among their intended audience. The Sibylline Oracles and the Wisdom of Solomon are other examples of Jewish literature in Greek from this general period.\n\nNo surviving Greek texts written after the year 100 can be securely identified as having a Jewish author. After this time, Jewish writings in Greek became irrelevant to Christians, who were thus unlikely to preserve them. The manuscription tradition of medieval Jewish culture has preserved only writings in Hebrew and Aramaic.\n\nThe \"Epistle to Diognetus\" states that language was not a determining factor in Christian identity; Christians might speak any language. By late antiquity, at least some Christian literature had been created for virtually every language in regular use throughout the Empire.\nThe international use of Greek was one factor enabling the spread of Christianity, as indicated for example by the use of Greek for the Epistles of Paul. Constantine, the first emperor to convert to Christianity, presumably knew some Greek, but Latin was spoken in his court, and he used an interpreter to address Greek-speaking bishops at the Council of Nicaea. In the Christian Latin West, Greek became associated with \"paganism\" and regarded as a foreign language (\"lingua peregrina)\". Saint Augustine confessed that he loathed Greek and found it hard to learn. By late antiquity, however, it was possible to speak Greek as a primary language while not conceiving of oneself as a \"Hellene\" in matters of religion and culture. In the first half of the 5th century, Greek was the standard language in which bishops communicated, and the \"Acta Conciliorum\" (\"Acts of the Church Councils\") were recorded originally in Greek and then translated into Latin, Syriac, or Coptic. During this period, Latin played only a subordinate role in the ecumenical councils, as did representatives from the Western empire. Although traditionally Armenian is regarded as having been established as a Christian language by this time, it does not appear in the \"Acta\". There are hints that Coptic might be spoken at the councils, but no secure record. On-the-spot translation into Greek was available for the participant who used his own language, including some who are referred to as \"Arabs\", \"Saracens\" or \"Ishmaelites\". Christian content has been found in a few Arabic inscriptions from the 6th century.\n\nThe form of private or personalized ritual characterized as \"magic\" might be conducted in a hodgepodge of languages. Magic, and even some therapies for illnesses, almost always involved incantation or the reciting of spells \"(carmina)\", often accompanied by the ritualized creation of inscribed tablets \"(lamellae)\" or amulets. These are known from both archaeological artifacts and written texts such as the Greek Magical Papyri, a collection of spells dating variously from the 2nd century BC to the 5th century AD. Although Augustus attempted to suppress magic by burning some 2,000 esoteric books early in his reign, magical practices were disseminated widely throughout the Greco-Roman world, and attest to an awareness of multilingualism among the peoples of the Empire. Spells were not translated, because their efficacy was thought to reside in their precise wording; a language such as Gaulish thus may have persisted for private ritual purposes when it no longer had everyday currency.\nThe Greek Magical Papyri \"(PGM)\" reflect Greco-Egyptian syncretism, incorporating not only Egyptian and Hellenistic religion, but Near Eastern elements, including Jewish magic and dashes of Christian magic. Egyptian and Greek deities, the God of the Jews and Judaic angels, and Jesus are named. The \"PGM\" are written primarily in Greek with substantial passages in Demotic Egyptian and inserted strings of syllables that are \"pronounceable, though unintelligible\". These \"voces magicae\" (\"magic words\") occur throughout magic texts and inscriptions, and often suggest corrupt Coptic or Egyptian, Hebrew, Aramaic or other Semitic languages, and Celtic. Hebrew and Greek appear in Demotic magical texts; Coptic magic incorporates Hebrew; Egyptian pops up in Latin spells. While many \"voces magicae\" may be deliberate neologisms or obscurantism, scholars have theorized that the more recognizable passages may be the products of garbled or misunderstood transmission, either in copying a source text or transcribing oral material.\n\nInscriptions for the practice of magic in Gaul show the characteristic use of Greek for spells in the Imperial period. A 2nd-century curse tablet from Autun (Augustodunum) lists the names of those to be cursed in Latin, two magic words in Greek, and a series of \"voces magicae\". A \"defixio\" (binding spell) from Amélie-les-Bains seems composed in Celtic with bits of Latin. A \"lamella\" from Roman Britain has been interpreted as Hebrew written in Greek characters.\n\nChristians in late antiquity might insert Hebrew into Greek exorcisms. Saint Jerome reports an odd story about a Frankish-Latin bilingual man of the \"Candidati\" Imperial bodyguard who, in a state of demonic possession, began speaking perfect Aramaic, a language he did not know.\n\nRoman law was written in Latin, and the \"letter of the law\" was tied strictly to the words in which it was expressed. Any language, however, could be binding in more general verbal contracts and procedures grounded in the \"ius gentium\" or international law. The \"ius gentium\" was not a written legal code, but was thought to exist among all peoples as a matter of natural law. Roman jurists show a concern for local languages such as Punic, Gaulish, and Aramaic in assuring the correct understanding and application of laws and oaths.\n\nWhile the birth certificates and wills of Roman citizens had to be written in Latin until the 220s, in the legal opinion of Ulpian (ca. 215), \"fideicommissa\" (bequests in trust) were not limited to Latin or even Greek, but could also be created in \"Punic, Gaulish or any other\" language. Originally, a testator's \"fideicommissum\" placed the heir under a moral rather than legal obligation, and Ulpian asserted that \"any kind of speech contains the obligation of its words, provided that each party understands the other's language himself or through accurate interpreters\". The jurist Gaius distinguished between verbal contracts that derived their validity from formulaic utterance in Latin, and obligations expressing a mutual understanding of the \"ius gentium\" regardless of whether the parties were Roman or not.\n\nAfter the decentralization of political power in late antiquity, Latin developed locally in the Western provinces into branches that became the Romance languages, including Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, Romanian and Catalan. As an international language of learning and literature, Latin itself continued as an active medium of expression for diplomacy and for intellectual developments identified with Renaissance humanism up to the 17th century, and for law and the Roman Catholic Church to the present.\n\nGreek continued as the language of the Byzantine Empire, but never replaced certain Afroasiatic languages with which it had long coexisted—primarily Coptic in Egypt, and Aramaic in Syria and Mesopotamia. \n\n\n\n"}

The name of the stable was invented by Jason Hervey and was inspired by and intended as a mockery of the famous New World Order (nWo).\n\nThe LWO was formed in late 1998 after Eddie Guerrero's spat with WCW head Eric Bischoff, a real-life conflict that was turned into a storyline. The idea for the group was the idea of Jason Hervey, a friend of Bischoff. The stable was originally supposed to revolve around Konnan, but it was given to Guerrero after Konnan joined the nWo Wolfpac.\n\nOn August 17, Guerrero gave a shoot, where he claimed to want out of his contract. After being taken off television for several weeks, Guerrero returned on the October 5 edition of \"WCW Monday Nitro\", forming the LWO with several other Mexican wrestlers. The group consisted of the majority of the Mexican roster, as well as Guerrero's friend Art Flores, who played the role of a bodyguard named Spyder.\n\nThe group consisted of almost every major Mexican wrestler on the WCW roster including Psychosis, La Parka, Hector Garza, and Juventud Guerrera. Their main feud lied with Rey Mysterio, Jr., after he refused to join the group. They also feuded with Billy Kidman, Mysterio's on-and-off American tag team partner. Mysterio was forced to become a member after losing a match to Eddie Guerrero. Chavo Guerrero, Jr. attempted to join several times, but Eddie did not allow him to become a member since Chavo was (kayfabe) mentally unstable at the time and carried around a wooden horse named Pepé.\n\nA car accident suffered by Guerrero on January 1, 1999 would help bring a premature end to the LWO. Three days later, the two factions of the New World Order reunited, and before long, various members of the LWO were found lying unconscious backstage. The nWo approached the LWO and demanded they immediately disband or face further consequences. The next week Ric Flair also asked the LWO to disband and fight for WCW promising he would treat them better than Bischoff did and also promising them money, women and limousines. Every member other than Mysterio agreed, removing their LWO shirts and exiting the ring. Mysterio, who was not originally a willing member of the group, proved himself the most loyal when he refused to remove his LWO colors. The nWo beat him down and forcibly tore off his LWO shirt, leading to a feud between Mysterio and The Outsiders.\n\nThe reunited nWo also betrayed their only Latino member, Konnan, who had objected to the brutality used against Mysterio, leading them to form a team against The Outsiders. As Eddie Guerrero healed and made his in-ring return, key LWO members such as himself, Mysterio, and Juventud Guerrera formed a popular new group with Konnan known as The Filthy Animals.\n\n"}

Although this may be motivated by practical considerations, such as unreliable grid power or long distance from the electrical grid, the term is mainly used currently for environmentally conscious approaches that aspire to zero or low-carbon footprints or cost reduction. It differs from micropower in that it is principally concerned with fixed power plants rather than for use with mobile devices.\n\nMicrogeneration technologies include small-scale wind turbines, micro hydro, solar PV systems, microbial fuel cells, ground source heat pumps, and micro combined heat and power installations. These technologies are often combined to form a hybrid power solution that can offer superior performance and lower cost than a system based on one generator.\n\nIn addition to the electricity production plant (e.g. wind turbine and solar panel), infrastructure for energy storage and power conversion and a hook-up to the regular electricity grid is usually needed and/or foreseen. Although a hookup to the regular electricity grid is not essential, it helps to decrease costs by allowing financial recompensation schemes. In the developing world however, the start-up cost for this equipment is generally too high, thus leaving no choice but to opt for alternative set-ups.\n\nThe whole of the equipment required to set up a working system and for an off-the-grid generation and/or a hook up to the electricity grid herefore is termed a balance of system and is composed of the following parts with PV-systems:\n\nA major issue with off-grid solar and wind systems is that the power is often needed when the sun is not shining or when the wind is calm, this is generally not required for purely grid-connected systems:\nor other means of energy storage (e.g. hydrogen fuel cells, Flywheel energy storage, pumped-storage hydroelectricity, compressed air tanks, ...)\n\nFor converting DC battery power into AC as required for many appliances, or for feeding excess power into a commercial power grid:\n\n\nUsually, in microgeneration for homes in the developing world, prefabricated house-wiring systems (as wiring harnesses or prefabricated distribution units) are used instead . Simplified house-wiring boxes and cables, known as wiring harnesses, can simply be bought and mounted into the building without requiring much knowledge about the wiring itself. As such, even people without technical expertise are able to install them. In addition, they are also comparatively cheap and offer safety advantages.\n\nWith wind turbines, hydroelectric plants, ... the extra equipment needed is more or less the same as with PV-systems (depending on the type of wind turbine used, yet also include:\n\nA new wind energy technology is being developed that converts energy from wind energy vibrations to electricity. This energy, called Vibro-Wind technology, can use winds of less strength than normal wind turbines, and can be placed in almost any location.\nA prototype consisted of a panel mounted with oscillators made out of pieces of foam. The conversion from mechanical to electrical energy is done using a piezoelectric transducer, a device made of a ceramic or polymer that emits electrons when stressed. The building of this prototype was led by Francis Moon, professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at Cornell University. Moon's work in Vibro-Wind Technology was funded by the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future at Cornell.\n\nSeveral microgeneration set-ups are possible. These are:\n\n\nAll set-ups mentioned can work either on a single power plant or a combination of power plants (in which case it is called a hybrid power system).\nFor safety, grid-connected set-ups must automatically switch off or enter an \"anti-islanding mode\" when there is a failure of the mains power supply. For more about this, see the article on the condition of islanding.\n\nDepending on the set-up chosen (financial recompensation scheme, power plant, extra equipment), prices may vary. According to Practical Action, microgeneration at home which uses the latest in cost saving-technology (wiring harnesses, ready boards, cheap DIY-power plants, e.g. DIY wind turbines) the household expenditure can be extremely low-cost. In fact, Practical Action mentions that many households in farming communities in the developing world spend less than $1 for electricity per month. . However, if matters are handled less economically (using more commercial systems/approaches), costs will be dramatically higher. In most cases however, financial advantage will still be done using microgeneration on renewable power plants; often in the range of 50-90% as local production has no electricity transportation losses on long distance power lines or energy losses from the Joule effect in transformers where in general 8-15% of the energy is lost.\n\nIn the UK, the government offers both grants and feedback payments to help businesses, communities and private homes to install these technologies. Businesses can write the full cost of installation off against taxable profits whilst homeowners receive a flat rate grant or payments per kW h of electricity generated and paid back into the national grid. Community organisations can also receive up to £200,000 in grant funding.\n\nIn the UK, the Microgeneration Certification Scheme provides approval for Microgeneration Installers and Products which is a mandatory requirement of funding schemes such as the Feed in Tariffs and Renewable Heat Incentive.\n\nGrid parity (or socket parity) occurs when an alternative energy source can generate electricity at a levelized cost (LCoE) that is less than or equal to the price of purchasing power from the electricity grid. Reaching grid parity is considered to be the point at which an energy source becomes a contender for widespread development without subsidies or government support. It is widely believed that a wholesale shift in generation to these forms of energy will take place when they reach grid parity.\n\nGrid parity has been reached in some locations with on-shore wind power around 2000, and with solar power it was achieved for the first time in Spain in 2013.\n\nMicrogeneration can dynamically balance the supply and demand for electric power, by producing more power during periods of high demand and high grid prices, and less power during periods of low demand and low grid prices. This \"hybridized grid\" allows both microgeneration systems \"and\" large power plants to operate with greater energy efficiency and cost effectiveness than either could alone.\n\nMicrogeneration can be integrated as part of a self-sufficient house and is typically complemented with other technologies such as domestic food production systems (permaculture and agroecosystem), rainwater harvesting, composting toilets or even complete greywater treatment systems. Domestic microgeneration technologies include: photovoltaic solar systems, small-scale wind turbines, micro combined heat and power installations, biodiesel and biogas.\n\nPrivate generation decentralizes the generation of electricity and may also centralize the pooling of surplus energy. While they have to be purchased, solar shingles and panels are both available. Capital cost is high, but saves in the long run. With appropriate power conversion, solar PV panels can run the same electric appliances as electricity from other sources.\n\nPassive solar water heating is another effective method of utilizing solar power. The simplest method is the solar (or a black plastic) bag. Set between 1 and 5 gallons out in the sun and allow to heat. Perfect for a quick warm shower.\n\nThe ‘breadbox’ heater can be constructed easily with recycled materials and basic building experience. Consisting of a single or array of black tanks mounted inside a sturdy box insulated on the bottom and sides. The lid, either horizontal or angled to catch the most sun, should be well sealed and of a transparent glazing material (glass, fiberglass, or high temp resistant molded plastic). Cold water enters the tank near the bottom, heats and rises to the top where it is piped back into the home.\n\nGround source heat pumps exploit stable ground temperatures by benefiting from the thermal energy storage capacity of the ground. Typically ground source heat pumps have a high initial cost and are difficult to install by the average homeowner. They use electric motors to transfer heat from the ground with a high level of efficiency. The electricity may come from renewable sources or from external non-renewable sources.\n\nBiodiesel is an alternative fuel that can power diesel engines and can be used for domestic heating. Numerous forms of biomass, including soybeans, peanuts, and algae (which has the highest yield), can be used to make biodiesel. Recycled vegetable oil (from restaurants) can also be converted into biodiesel.\nBiogas is another alternative fuel, created from the waste product of animals. Though less practical for most homes, a farm environment provides a perfect place to implement the process. By mixing the waste and water in a tank with space left for air, methane produces naturally in the airspace. This methane can be piped out and burned, and used for a cookfire.\n\nThe biogaspro digester provides an easily installed digester suitable for small farms or even large homes. Groups of homes can possible group together to use a digester \n\nPolicymakers were accustomed to an energy system based on big, centralised projects like nuclear or gas-fired power stations. A change of mindsets and incentives are bringing microgeneration into the mainstream. Planning regulations may also require streamlining to facilitate the retrofitting of microgenerating facilities onto homes and buildings.\n\nMost of developed countries, including Canada (Alberta), the United Kingdom, Germany, Poland, Israel and USA have laws allowing microgenerated electricity to be sold into the national grid.\n\nIn January 2009, the Government of Alberta‘s Micro-Generation Regulation came into effect, setting rules that allow Albertans to generate their own environmentally friendly electricity and receive credit for any power they send into the electricity grid.\n\nIn December 2014, the Polish government will vote on a bill which calls for microgeneration, as well as large scale wind farms in the Baltic Sea as a solution to cut back on co2 emissions from the country's coal plants as well as to reduce Polish dependence on Russian gas. Under the terms of the new bill, individuals and small businesses which generate up to 40 kW of 'green' energy will receive 100% of market price for any electricity they feed back into the grid, and businesses who set up large-scale offshore wind farms in the Baltic will be eligible for subsidization by the state. Costs of implementing these new policies will be offset by the creation of a new tax on non-sustainable energy use.\n\nThe United States has inconsistent energy generation policies across its 50 states. State energy policies and laws may vary significantly with location. Some states have imposed requirements on utilities that a certain percentage of total power generation be from renewable sources. For this purpose, renewable sources include wind, hydroelectric, and solar power whether from large or microgeneration projects. Further, in some areas transferrable \"renewable source energy\" credits are needed by power companies to meet these mandates. As a result, in some portions of the United States, power companies will pay a portion of the cost of renewable source microgeneration projects in their service areas. These rebates are in addition to any Federal or State renewable-energy income-tax credits that may be applicable. In other areas, such rebates may differ or may not be available.\n\nThe UK Government published its Microgeneration Strategy in March 2006, although it was seen as a disappointment by many commentators. In contrast, the Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006 has been viewed as a positive step. To replace earlier schemes, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) launched the Low Carbon Buildings Programme in April 2006, which provided grants to individuals, communities and businesses wishing to invest in microgenerating technologies. These schemes have been replaced in turn by new proposals from the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) for clean energy cashback via Feed-In Tariffs for generating electricity from April 2010 and the Renewable Heat Incentive for generating renewable heat from 28 November 2011.\n\nFeed-In Tariffs are intended to incentivise small-scale (less than 5MW), low-carbon electricity generation. These feed-in tariffs work alongside the Renewables Obligation (RO), which will remain the primary mechanism to incentivise deployment of large-scale renewable electricity generation. The Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) in intended to incentivise the generation of heat from renewable sources. They also currently offer up to 21p per kWh from December 2011 in the Tariff for photovoltaics plus another 3p for the Export Tariff - an overall figure which could see a household earning back double what they currently pay for their electricity.\n\nOn 31 October 2011, the government announced a sudden cut in the feed-in tariff from 43.3p/kWh to 21p/kWh with the new tariff to apply to all new solar PV installations with an eligibility date on or after 12 December 2011.\n\nProminent British politicians who have announced they are fitting microgenerating facilities to their homes include the Conservative party leader, David Cameron, and the Labour Science Minister, Malcolm Wicks. These plans included small domestic sized wind turbines. Cameron, before becoming Prime Minister in the 2010 general elections, had been asked during an interview on BBC One’s The Politics Show on October 29, 2006, if he would do the same should he get to 10 Downing Street. \"“If they’d let me, yes,”\" he replied.\n\nIn the December 2006 Pre-Budget Report the government announced that the sale of surplus electricity from installations designed for personal use, would not be subject to Income Tax. Legislation to this effect has been included in the Finance Bill 2007.\n\nSeveral movies and TV shows such as The Mosquito Coast, Jericho, The Time Machine and Beverly Hills Family Robinson have done a great deal in raising interest in microgeneration among the general public. Websites such as Instructables and Practical Action propose DIY solutions that can lower the cost of microgeneration, thus increasing its popularity. Specialised magazines such as OtherPower and Home Power also provide practical advice and guidance.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42091580", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42091580", "title": "National Library of Kosovo", "text": "National Library of Kosovo\n\nThe National Library of Kosovo (; ) is the highest library institution in Kosovo established by the Assembly and is located in Pristina.\n\nThe mission of the library is to collect, preserve, promote and make accessible the documentary and intellectual heritage of Kosovo. It holds exhibitions and holds an archive of national newspapers. The library also provides a number of other services. It is known for its unique history, and the style of the building designed by Croatian architect Andrija Mutnjaković, followed by controversies about the outside appearance of it.\n\nThe history of libraries in Kosovo dates back to the 14th and 15th centuries. Collections of the Christian and Muslim religious communities are considered as the oldest archives libraries in Kosovo.\n\nKosovo's institutional library was officially founded in December 1944 in the city of Prizren, which at the time was the capital of the Autonomous Province of Kosovo.\n\nIn 1982 the library was moved to the current building which was built in Pristina, the current capital of Kosovo.\n\nOver the years the National Library's name has changed depending on the political position of Kosovo.\n\n\"Note that the former official names of the National Library of Kosovo are originally in Albanian and can be found in the library's journal Bibloletra\"\n\nIn 1989, Kosovo's status as an autonomous region of Serbia was revoked, tens of thousands of Kosovo Albanians working in the public sector lost their jobs, and Albanian students were prohibited from taking courses in the Albanian language. For public and private libraries in Kosovo, this was a time when many library collections were burned and destroyed.\n\nThe library was subsequently used to house a large number of refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia who had fled their countries due to the Yugoslav Wars. After NATO's occupation of Kosovo in June 1999, it was revealed that the Yugoslav Army had used the library as a command-and-control centre. The materials inside had been stolen, reading room furniture smashed, and the card catalogue had been dumped in the basement. The library workers were kept out for a week while Kosovo Force (KFOR) peacekeeping troops checked the building for any hidden explosives.\n\nAccording to national and international organizations, about 100,000 Albanian-language books have been sent to the paper mill in Lipjan for pulping. Among those books were collections of national heritage, which explained the nation's origins and history.\nAfter the war in Kosovo there was a great will and desire to reconstruct the library buildings and re-establish library services at all levels. This was done with the assistance of a special group of experts from UNESCO, the Council of Europe (CoE) and the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA).\n\nThis special group of experts created different training programs like: Legislation and Administration, Mobile Library, Reconstruction, Book and Reading, Information Technology Professional Training and Development, Cultural Heritage, Children and Youth, Open Access Programme, Initiative Support, Twinning.\nDuring the years of reorganization the National Library of Kosovo has been aided by many institutions such as the US Embassy, OSCE, Zentralbibliothek Zürich, German Artist Initiatives, Raiffeisen Bank.\n\nThe most significant part of the current library is its building. There are contradictory opinions about its style, which have resulted in different versions regarding the building. The current building of the National Library of Kosovo was inaugurated on 25 November 1982. It was designed by the Croatian architect Andrija Mutnjaković. Its space consists of 16,500 square meters. It is made with zenith windows, with a total 99 domes of different sizes and is entirely covered in a metal fishing net, which have their own particular architectural symbolism.\n\nIt houses two reading rooms with 300 and 100 seats respectively, a reading room for periodicals, rooms for special collections, cataloguing and research, a 150-seat amphitheatre and a 75-seat meeting hall. It has the capacity to accommodate about two million volumes. The materials are located on two levels below grade and are closed to the public.\n\nThe lobby of the library is used for various cultural events. The floor of the hall is a unique work of diverse mosaic marble stone. The largest dome of the library is the main ornament of the hall's high ceiling, thus providing ample natural lighting.\n\nAccording to the architect of the National Library of Kosovo the building is meant to represent a style blending Byzantine and Islamic architectural forms. In other sources there are statements from the actual architect that “this project which is linked to the tradition of pre-Romanesque architecture of the Balkans, was being considered among other project for the Sarajevo National Library building”.\n\nBy others this building is seen as a reaction to the impersonality of International Style and an attempt to combine modern means with regional traditions and rural architecture, but also as a Modern-Metabolist style.\n\nDespite the official statements of the architect about the style of the National Library of Kosovo there are many other controversies when it comes to the appearance of the building and its meaning.\nOne of the most famous versions is the one that connects the domes of the building with the national Albanian hat “plisi”.\nThis was the reason why Serbian politicians reacted very strongly about the appearance of the building.\n\nAnother version is that this project was meant to reconcile the relations between Serbians and Albanians. Its domes are a combination of existing Turkish baths in Prizren and Patriarchate of Peć.\n\nThe National Library of Kosovo is responsible for coordinating all Kosovo libraries within the country. Also, it is responsible for supplying information for higher education and research, and access to various databases.\n\nThe National Library of Kosovo has 1,890,194 library units, with 475,324 titles, which 382,806 of them are books, 281,591 are magazines, 984,022 newspapers and 241,775 other units. Between 2004 and 2009 the library was enriched with 30,000 new titles.\n\nIn 2013 the number of the library's collections reached 2 million units.\n\nCollections of rare old books, old newspapers and magazines, Albanian manuscripts with Latin, Greek and Arabic graphics are a precious treasure of cultural heritage stored in this institution. Also, maps, photo documents and other valuable documents present a great cultural heritage.\n\nThe oldest book found in Nacional Library is \"Historia de vita et gestis Scanderbegi Epirotarum principis\" by Marin Barleti. This book is written in Latin language.\n\nNational Library of Kosovo uses three international cataloging standards. AACR2 which is ISNC standard, ISBD which is IFLA standard and MARC 21 standard. The National Library of Kosovo uses two standard classification of materials, Universal Decimal Classification and Subject Classification.\n\nAnyone may use National Library services, but people must be at least 18 to request and order materials from the collections. Items of the Library cannot be borrowed for home use and must be read in one of the reading rooms. About 5000 users are registered every year, making it the most frequented library in Kosovo.\n\nAlthough considered as one of the ugliest buildings in the world, this doesn't stop it from being one of the most visited attractions in Kosovo.\n\nThe National Library is a state institution which reports to the Ministry of Culture and it is regulated by law.\nThere are several mini libraries inside the National Library like the American Corner, Library of Contemporary Art, NATO Library, Music Library, Library for the Blind, Fehmi Agani Library, Library of Krist Maloki, Authors Archive Library, etc.\n\nDigitization for the National Library of Kosovo is a project of great importance. During this process, the National Library of Kosovo aims to put online the national heritage and other materials dealing with Kosovo to promote them and to make it easier for natives and individuals from other countries to have access to it. In 2008, with a view to developing a portal resembling the American Memory, Memory (), the Documentary Centre of Kosovo was established.\n\nDue to the very large number of documents that must digitized, a process that takes a lot of time, the Library has established a sequence of criteria for documents that must be digitized before others and one of the basic criteria is the cultural and historical value of that material. Based on those criteria, these are the documents that have priority in digitization : most requested material which is in poor physical condition, historical books and manuscripts, microfilms and other very required materials.\n\nIn general, materials that are most commonly digitized are rare books (49%), photographs (44%), manuscripts (39%), monographs (35%), music (30%), newspapers (9%), maps (1%).\n\nBesides digitizing its own material the National Library of Kosovo provides access to some of the most popular electronic resources in the world and that made possible through the Electronic Library Consortium of Kosovo. For services for electronic resources in different libraries of the world the National Library of Kosovo was supported by Kosovo Foundation for Open Society, and by companies like EBSCO and GALE with financial support from the U.S. Embassy in Pristina. While Raiffeisen Bank Kosovo supported the Oxford Music Online and the OSCE Mission in Kosovo supported OXFORD Scholarship Online and Oxford Journal.\n\nThere are many other libraries in Kosovo, such as the Library of the Academy of Sciences and Arts of Kosovo, Albanology Institute Library Pristina, , and other school and faculty libraries, which are developed in scientific and educational institutions.\n\nOne of the main goals of the National Library of Kosovo is the establishment and reactivation of many new libraries in order to develop the librarianship of Kosovo.\n\n"}

In 2008 funding from One NorthEast was awarded for an additional three festivals (2009–2011). The festival is delivered in partnership with Centre for Life, Tyne and Wear Museums, Newcastle Science City, Newcastle University, Newcastle City Council and culture10 as part of NewcastleGateshead’s world-class programme of festivals and events.\n\nIn 2009, the festival was re-launched with a new brand identity and website. There were three key strands of the programme catering for three different audiences; families, adults and schools. It included two family weekend events (7/8 & 14/15 March) and a series of adult events (lectures/science fiction/performances) during the week, as well as activities specifically for schools. The highlight of the week was the first Maker Faire event in the UK, which was held at the Centre for Life and Discovery Museum on the 14 and 15 March.\n\nAlthough there was no overarching theme for 2009, some events integrated with the national agenda. For example, to celebrate Charles Darwin’s 200th birthday, the festival commissioned the Darwin Brewery in Sunderland to develop a commemorative beer called Natural Selection which was available throughout March.\n\nIn 2010, ScienceFest saw the return of Maker Faire – an event for DIY technology and craft, ScienceFest After Dark – a series of late night, adult only events and events specially focussed on developing science literacy skills.\n\nHeadline makers included the world’s fastest Rubik’s cube solving robot, Power Tool\nDrag Racing and the UK’s most advanced musical tesla coil.\n\nNewcastle Science Festival 2010 was attended by 51,000 people, including families,\nadults and children, across 120 events at 23 locations over a 10-day period.

The museum is located in the central area of Belgrade, Serbia. It holds more than 160,000 original documents, over 2,000 books and journals, over 1,200 historical technical exhibits, over 1,500 photographs and photo plates of original, technical objects, instruments and apparatus, and over 1,000 plans and drawings. The Nikola Tesla Archive was inscribed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme Register in 2003 due to its critical role regarding history of electrification of the world and future technological advancements in this area.\n\nThe Nikola Tesla Museum is housed in a residential villa built in 1927 according to the designs of Dragiša Brašovan, a distinguished Serbian architect. The building was used for various purposes until December 5, 1952, when the Nikola Tesla Museum was founded in accordance with the decision of the Government of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. Certain items for the museum were shipped from New York City to Belgrade, Yugoslavia, on September 7, 1951, as a result of efforts by Sava Kosanović, Tesla's nephew and closest relative and his attorney Philip Wittenberg.\n\nThe permanent exhibition was arranged in 1955. From time to time there have been some modifications, but for many years the basic concept has remained the same. Its first part is primarily a memorial exhibition, while the second part is an interactive one, with 3D computer generated models of Tesla's inventions. From time to time, the museum organizes thematic exhibitions of documents, photographs and other material in order to display some periods from Tesla's inventive life.\n\nReconstruction of the Nikola Tesla Museum started on November 3, 2006. The first phase of the project was scheduled to have been complete by the end of 2006. The garden on the roof of the museum was designed to be enclosed by glass windows, which would turn the roof into a computer room. This reconstruction is now complete, and the museum is available to visit.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38212", "title": "Numismatics", "text": "Numismatics\n\nNumismatics is the study or collection of currency, including coins, tokens, paper money, and related objects. While numismatists are often characterised as students or collectors of coins, the discipline also includes the broader study of money and other payment media used to resolve debts and the exchange of goods. Early money used by people is referred to as \"Odd and Curious\", but the use of other goods in barter exchange is excluded, even where used as a circulating currency (e.g., cigarettes in prison). The Kyrgyz people used horses as the principal currency unit and gave small change in lambskins; the lambskins may be suitable for numismatic study, but the horses are not. Many objects have been used for centuries, such as cowry shells, precious metals, cocoa beans, large stones, and gems.\n\nToday, most transactions take place by a form of payment with either inherent, standardized, or credit value. \"Numismatic value\" is the value in excess of the monetary value conferred by law, which is known as the \"collector value\".\n\nEconomic and historical studies of money's use and development are an integral part of the numismatists' study of money's physical embodiment.\n\nFirst attested in English 1829, the word \"numismatics\" comes from the adjective \"numismatic\", meaning \"of coins\". It was borrowed in 1792 from French \"numismatiques\", itself a derivation from Late Latin \"numismatis\", genitive of \"numisma\", a variant of \"nomisma\" meaning \"coin\". Nomisma is a latinisation of the Greek νόμισμα (\"nomisma\") which means \"current coin/custom\", which derives from νομίζω (\"nomizō\"), \"to hold or own as a custom or usage, to use customarily\", in turn from νόμος (\"nomos\"), \"usage, custom\", ultimately from νέμω (\"nemō\"), \"I dispense, divide, assign, keep, hold\".\n\nThroughout its history, money itself has been made to be a scarce good, although it does not have to be. Many materials have been used to form money, from naturally scarce precious metals and cowry shells through cigarettes to entirely artificial money, called fiat money, such as banknotes. Many complementary currencies use time as a unit of measure, using mutual credit accounting that keeps the balance of money intact.\n\nModern money (and most ancient money too) is essentially a token – an abstraction. Paper currency is perhaps the most common type of physical money today. However, goods such as gold or silver retain many of the essential properties of money, such as volatility and limited supply. However, these goods are not controlled by one single authority.\n\nCoin collecting may have existed in ancient times. Caesar Augustus gave \"coins of every device, including old pieces of the kings and foreign money\" as Saturnalia gifts.\n\nPetrarch, who wrote in a letter that he was often approached by vinediggers with old coins asking him to buy or to identify the ruler, is credited as the first Renaissance collector. Petrarch presented a collection of Roman coins to Emperor Charles IV in 1355.\n\nThe first book on coins was \"De Asse et Partibus\" (1514) by Guillaume Budé. During the early Renaissance ancient coins were collected by European royalty and nobility. Collectors of coins were Pope Boniface VIII, Emperor Maximilian of the Holy Roman Empire, Louis XIV of France, Ferdinand I, Elector Joachim II of Brandenburg who started the Berlin coin cabinet and Henry IV of France to name a few. Numismatics is called the \"Hobby of Kings\", due to its most esteemed founders.\n\nProfessional societies organised in the 19th century. The Royal Numismatic Society was founded in 1836 and immediately began publishing the journal that became the \"Numismatic Chronicle\". The American Numismatic Society was founded in 1858 and began publishing the \"American Journal of Numismatics\" in 1866.\n\nIn 1931 the British Academy launched the Sylloge Nummorum Graecorum publishing collections of Ancient Greek coinage. The first volume of Sylloge of Coins of the British Isles was published in 1958.\n\nIn the 20th century coins gained recognition as archaeological objects, scholars such as Guido Bruck of the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna realised their value in providing a temporal context and the difficulty that curators faced when identifying worn coins using classical literature. After World War II in Germany a project, \"Fundmünzen der Antike\" (Coin finds of the Classical Period) was launched, to register every coin found within Germany. This idea found successors in many countries.\n\nIn the United States, the US mint established a coin Cabinet in 1838 when chief coiner Adam Eckfeldt donated his personal collection. William E. Du Bois’ \"Pledges of History...\" (1846) describes the cabinet.\n\nC. Wyllys Betts' \"American colonial history illustrated by contemporary medals\" (1894) set the groundwork for the study of American historical medals.\n\nHelen Wang's \"A short history of Chinese numismatics in European languages\" (2012-2013) gives an outline history of Western countries' understanding of Chinese numismatics.\n\nModern numismatics is the study of the coins of the mid-17th century onward, the period of machine-struck coins. Their study serves more the need of collectors than historians and it is more often successfully pursued by amateur aficionados than by professional scholars. The focus of modern numismatics lies frequently in the research of production and use of money in historical contexts using mint or other records in order to determine the relative rarity of the coins they study. Varieties, mint-made errors, the results of progressive die wear, mintage figures and even the sociopolitical context of coin mintings are also matters of interest.\n\nExonumia (UK English: Paranumismatica) is the study of coin-like objects such as token coins and medals, and other items used in place of legal currency or for commemoration. This includes elongated coins, encased coins, souvenir medallions, tags, badges, counterstamped coins, wooden nickels, credit cards, and other similar items. It is related to numismatics proper (concerned with coins which have been legal tender), and many coin collectors are also exonumists.\n\nNotaphily is the study of paper money or banknotes.\nIt is believed that people have been collecting paper money for as long as it has been in use. However, people only started collecting paper money systematically in Germany in the 1920s, particularly the \"Serienscheine\" (Series notes) Notgeld. The turning point occurred in the 1970s, when notaphily was established as a separate area by collectors.\nAt the same time, some developed countries such as the United States, Germany and France began publishing their respective national catalogues of paper money, which represented major points of reference literature.\n\nScripophily is the study and collection of stocks and Bonds. It is an area of collecting due to both the inherent beauty of some historical documents as well as the interesting historical context of each document. Some stock certificates are excellent examples of engraving. Occasionally, an old stock document will be found that still has value as a stock in a successor company.\n\nThe term numismatist applies to collectors and coin dealers as well as scholars using coins as source or studying coins.\n\nThe first group chiefly derive pleasure from the simple ownership of monetary devices and studying these coins as private amateur scholars. In the classical field amateur collector studies have achieved quite remarkable progress in the field. Examples are Walter Breen, a well-known example of a noted numismatist who was not an avid collector, and King Farouk I of Egypt was an avid collector who had very little interest in numismatics. Harry Bass by comparison was a noted collector who was also a numismatist.\n\nThe second group are the coin dealers. Often called professional numismatists, they authenticate or grade coins for commercial purposes. The buying and selling of coin collections by numismatists who are professional dealers advances the study of money, and expert numismatists are consulted by historians, museum curators, and archaeologists.\n\nThe third category are scholar numismatists working in public collections, universities or as independent scholars acquiring knowledge about monetary devices, their systems, their economy and their historical context. An example would be G. Kenneth Jenkins. Coins are especially relevant as source in the pre-modern period.\n\nSee also Portraits of Famous Numismatists who died before 1800 and Portraits of Famous Numismatists who died after 1800\n\n\n"}

A multifaceted task, it involves managing an opera company, primarily the singers and musicians who perform the operas, but in many cases also managing the opera house in which the company performs. \n\nOpera is a complex art form involving high fixed costs and requiring complex management. In addition to the singers and musicians who form the core of the company its production requires scenery and costumes and sometimes dancers and non-singing actors. Fixed costs in today's opera organizations—keeping many of the singers and musicians on year-round contracts, and if managing their own theatre, the cost of workers needed to create and maintain the sets and costumes as well as the cost of maintaining and running the building—combined with the costs of individual productions, make opera the most expensive of the performing arts. However, even in the 19th century when opera was largely run by individual impresarios rather than large organisations, opera management as a profession was characterised as \"a devouror of the fortunes of the victims it has tempted by its seductions\". Frederick Gye, who turned the Royal Italian Opera in Covent Garden into one of London's premiere opera houses in the 19th century and who shaped the careers of many famous singers, described opera management as a \"dreadful business\".\n\nThe earliest operas were privately performed and financed by the noble families who commissioned them, often to mark great court occasions. One such example was Marco da Gagliano's \"La Flora\", performed in 1628 at the Medici Palace in Florence to celebrate the marriage of Margherita de' Medici and Odoardo Farnese, Duke of Parma. Grand Duchess Maria Maddalena, the wife of Cosimo II de' Medici and the mother of the bride, took an active role in the planning of the production. She secured the services of the musicians and singers, attended the rehearsals, and according to musicologist Kelley Harness, may well have contributed to the development of the plot as well. \n\nPublicly performed operas first appeared in Venice during the Carnival season of 1637. This was facilitated by the large number of public theatres already present in the city which originally served for the production of plays. They were built by noble families such as the Grimani, Tron, and Vendramin. The rebuilt Teatro San Cassiano, sponsored by the Tron family, was the first in the world specifically devoted to opera. Performances of \"L'Andromeda\" in 1637 by librettist Benedetto Ferrari and composer Francesco Manelli marked the theatre's first commercially produced opera. In the majority of cases the patrician Venetian owners profited from their theatres by renting them out to others who produced and managed the opera performances. The key figure in the actual production of the operas was the impresario, who assembled the singers, musicians and creative team and made the business and artistic decisions. Sometimes the impresarios were hired by the theatre renters and their backers. On other occasions the impresario was also one of the investors and the renter of the theatre. The \"cassier\" (cashier) was in charge the financial side of the production, including handling the payments and receipts. While the \"cassier\" was sometimes a separate member of the management team, in many instances the impresario also acted as the \"cassier\". One of the most famous impresarios of the day was Marco Faustini who managed several Venetian opera houses in the course of his career.\n\n\n\n"}

It is an internationally recognized surgical specialty. In countries such as the UK, Australia, New Zealand and most of Europe, it is recognized as both a specialty of medicine and dentistry, and a dual degree in medicine and dentistry is compulsory. In other countries including the United States, India, Canada, Brazil, and Sweden, it is a recognized specialty of dentistry.\n\nIn several countries oral and maxillofacial surgery is a speciality recognized by a professional association, as is the case with the Dental Council of India, American Dental Association, Royal College of Surgeons of England, Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, Royal College of Dentists of Canada, Royal Australasian College of Dental Surgeons and Brazilian Federal Council of Odontology (CFO).\n\nIn other countries oral and maxillofacial surgery as a specialty exists but under different forms, as the work is sometimes performed by a single or dual qualified specialist depending on each country's regulations and training opportunities available.\n\nAn oral and maxillofacial surgeon is a regional specialist surgeon treating the entire craniomaxillofacial complex: anatomical area of the mouth, jaws, face, and skull, as well as associated structures.\n\nDepending upon the jurisdiction, maxillofacial surgeons may require training in dentistry, surgery, and general medicine; training and qualification in medicine may be undertaken optionally even if not required.\n\nOral and maxillofacial surgery is widely recognized as one of the specialties of dentistry. In many countries, however, maxillofacial surgery is a medical specialty requiring both medical and dental degrees, culminating in an appropriate qualification (e.g. Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, FRCS, in the UK). All oral and maxillofacial surgeons, however, must obtain a university degree in dentistry before beginning residency training in oral and maxillofacial surgery. In the United States oral and maxillofacial residency programs are either four or six years in duration. Programs that grant the MD degree are six years in duration.\n\nThey also may choose to undergo further training in a one or two year subspecialty Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Fellowship Training in the following areas:\n\n\nThe popularity of oral and maxillofacial surgery as a career for persons whose first degree was medicine, not dentistry, seems to be increasing in a few EU countries. However, the public funds spent for 14 years of training are of a major concern for governments. Integrated programs are becoming more available to medical graduates allowing them to complete the dental degree requirement in about three years in order for them to advance to subsequently complete oral and maxillofacial surgical training.\n\nTreatments may be performed on the craniomaxillofacial complex: mouth, jaws, face, neck, and skull, and include:\n\n\nIn the United States, oral and maxillofacial surgeons are required to undergo five months of intensive general anesthesia training. An additional month of pediatric anesthesia training is also required.\n\nThe American Society of Anesthesiologists published a \"Statement on the Anesthesia Care Team\" which specifies qualified anesthesia personnel and practitioners as anesthesiologists, anesthesiology fellows, anesthesiology residents,oral and maxillofacial surgery residents, anesthesiologist assistants, and nurse anesthetists.\n\nLasers were first introduced to OMS in the mid-1980s starting with the CO laser. The CO (carbon dioxide) laser remains the gold standard for the soft tissue surgery because of the ease of simultaneous photo-thermal ablation and coagulation (and small blood capillary hemostasis).\n\nOral and maxillofacial surgery is one of the nine dental specialties recognized by the American Dental Association, Royal College of Dentists of Canada, and the Royal Australasian College of Dental Surgeons. Oral and maxillofacial surgery requires four to six years of further formal university training after dental school (i.e., DDS, BDent, DMD or BDS).\n\nIn the United States, four-year residency programs grant a certificate of specialty training in oral and maxillofacial surgery. Six-year residency programs grant the specialty certificate in addition to a degree such as a medical degree (e.g., MD, DO, MBBS, MBChB) or research degree (e.g., MS, MSc, MPhil, MDS, MSD, MDSc, DClinDent, DSc, DMSc, PhD). Both four– and six–year graduates are designated US \"Board Eligible\" and those who earn \"Certification\" are Diplomats. Approximately 50% of the training programs in the US and 66% of Canadian training programs are \"dual-degree\".\n\nThe typical training program for an oral and maxillofacial surgeon is:\n\n\nIn addition, graduates of oral and maxillofacial surgery training programs can pursue fellowships, typically 1–2 years in length, in the following areas:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "15912688", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15912688", "title": "P. Jeevanandham", "text": "P. Jeevanandham\n\nP. Jeevanandham (21 August 1907 – 18 January 1963) also called \"Jeeva\", was a social reformer, political leader, litterateur and one of the pioneers of the Communist and socialist movements in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. \n\nHe was not only a socio-political leader, but was also a cultural theoretician, an excellent orator, journalist and critic; and above all, a relentless fighter for the deprived. A down-to-earth person with a clean record in public life, Jeevanandham was held in high esteem by ordinary people.\n\nP. Jeevanandham was born in the town of Boothapandi, in the then princely state of Travancore (which is now in Kanyakumari District of Tamil Nadu) into an orthodox middle-class family on 21 August 1907. His original name was Sorimuthu. He was named this name after his clan god Sorimuthu.\n\nThe orthodox and religious background of his family exposed Jeevanandham to literature, devotional songs and the arts, early on in his life. He grew up in an era when caste-based rigidity was widely prevalent, and from early on in his life he resented the very idea of untouchability and could not tolerate his Dalit friends being denied entry into temples and public places and being humiliated. Even as a schoolboy he became averse to \"Varnasrama Dharma\", a Hindu religious code that stratifies society on caste lines and facilitates the practice of untouchability. The national movement and Gandhi’s call to wear khadi and his stand against untouchability influenced Jeevanandham to join the movement. He began wearing only khadi from then on.\n\nJeevanandham took his Dalit friends into the streets and public places where, usually, entry was denied to them, which earned him the displeasure of his family and orthodox caste members in his village. His father disapproved his behaviour and asked him to stop all things which were against their caste traditions. Jeevanandham said he would rather leave his home rather than follow discriminatory practices and eventually did so.\n\nJeevanandham started his political life basing himself on Gandhian ideas. In 1924, he participated in the Vaikom Satyagraha against upper-caste Hindus, where Dalits were barred from walking on the road leading to the temple at Vaikom. He participated in a similar protest, demanding entry for Dalits into the Suchindram temple. When he joined an ashram run by V. V. S. Aiyar at Cheranmadevi, he found that Dalits and ‘upper-caste’ students were fed in separate halls. He supported Periyar’s protest against this practice and quit the ashram. Later, he took charge of an ashram funded by a philanthropist in \"Siruvayal\" near Karaikkudi. The ashram life gave him an opportunity to read a lot of books. In this ashram, he got opportunity to meet Gandhi. Jeeva had written a letter to Gandhi disagreeing with his methods. When Gandhi came to Madras, he had this letter in his pocket and wanted to meet Jeeva. Rajagopalachari asked Gandhi to name the person he wanted to meet so that particular person can be called. Gandhi mentioned that he did not want the person to be called and would like to go to the ashram where Jeeva resided and meet him. When Gandhi went to the Siruvayal ashram and asked for Jeeva a young man of around 25 years appeared before him. Gandhi asked him if he was the same person who wrote the 'letter' and Jeeva replied in the affirmative. \n\nWhen Periyar (Periyar E. V. Ramasamy), on returning from a visit to the Soviet Union, spoke highly of its achievements and expressed his desire to propagate socialism, Jeevanandham, who was by then familiar with the egalitarian principle, felt elated. His hopes of getting the national movement merged with the Congress Socialist Party were dashed when Periyar began dragging his feet. He, however, remained in the Congress. He was elected as a member of the All India Congress Committee, a prestigious post in those days, and was also a member of the working committee of the State Congress unit. Later, when the Madras Provincial Congress Socialist Party was formed in 1937, Jeevanandham became its first secretary. He joined the Communist Party of India (CPI) two years later along with P. Ramamurthi, another veteran of the movement.\n\nThe last 25 years of colonial rule saw the emergence of two movements in Tamil Nadu – the Self-Respect Movement (which was a precursor to the Dravidian movement led by Periyar) and the Communist movement. Before enrolling himself as the first member of the united CPI in Tamil Nadu, Jeevanandham was an active participant in these two earlier movements. His patriotism took him to the national movement; his revulsion toward untouchability and caste-based discrimination led him to support the Self-Respect Movement.\n\nAfter joining the CPI, Jeevanandham and Ramamurthi organized rickshaw-pullers and factory workers on Marxist lines. In this they were assisted by leaders such as M. R. Venkatraman and B. Srinivasa Rao. They had already organized workers and formed unions in industrial towns such as Madurai and Coimbatore when they were functioning as socialists. Jeevanandham was in the forefront of efforts to build a strong labor movement based on Marxism. His oratory and writings helped him fulfill the task. But these leaders suffered police repression and were imprisoned several times. Jeevanandham visited sensitive areas and kept the workers’ fighting spirit alive. Alongside industrial workers, agricultural laborers and small farmers were also organized in Thanjavur and other districts. Jeevanandham and Ramamurthi inspired thousands of people through powerful speeches.\n\nUnder the colonial rule, Marxist literature and propaganda were banned, and Marxist workers were frequently arrested on one pretext or the other. Jeevanandham was no exception. He even had an externment order against him and had to stay away from the then Madras province for a brief period.\n\nAfter Indian Independence, the ban on the CPI was lifted, and all its leaders were released.\n\nIn the first general elections in post independent India, Jeevanandham won a seat for the Legislative Assembly from the Wasermanpet constituency in Madras. P. Ramamurthi, his close associate, who was in jail then, was also elected from the Madurai constituency. After being elected to the Legislative Assembly, he put pressure on the government to initiate action on issues relating to development schemes and reform measures. He also led many struggles, one of which was against the proposal to form \"Dakshina Pradesh\" comprising the four southern states. Despite his loss in the subsequent elections, he continued his party work.\n\nHe played a key role in making his native Tamil language an official language in the state and the judiciary, and a medium of instruction in educational institutions.\n\nHe was a supporter of pure usage of Tamil, which had, to an extent, become corrupted by the influence of Sanskrit and other languages. He declared his name to be \"Uyirinban\", a literal translation of the Sanskrit word \"Jeevanandham\". One of his major influences was the works of the Tamil poet Subramania Bharati, and also Bharati's persona and simple lifestyle. Jeevanandham was the first to take to cultural politics and cited his long struggle for nationalising Subramania Bharati’s songs.\nHe was well-versed in Tamil literature and was a good orator.\n\nJeevanandham was the founder of \"Thamara\", a Tamil literary magazine. The Communist Tamil newspaper \"JanaSakthi\" was also begun with his commitment.\n\nPeriyar encouraged Jeeva to translate Bhagat Singh’s classic essay \"Why I am an Atheist\" in 1933. He translated it into Tamil, which was probably its first-ever translation. It was published by Periyar's publication.\n\nJeeva led a busy and hectic life: teaching classes on Marxism for party workers, advising students to equip themselves to meet the nascent republic’s development needs, addressing literary fora on topics such as the greatness of the poet Bharati, explaining the flaws in the government’s language policy at meetings of intellectuals, and addressing factory gate meetings in support of workers on strike. In between, he wrote editorials for the party daily or discussed strategies for resolving industrial disputes.\n\nIn 1962, his health suffered a setback. Later in the year he visited the Soviet Union. He took treatment there and returned by the end of the year. However, his health worsened weeks later. On 18 January 1963, he died at his modest home at Tambaram, near Chennai. About two lakh (200,000) people attended his funeral and paid their last respects to one who had toiled all his life for the common man, who symbolised the simplicity of Gandhism and who had a Periyar-like zest for social equality and the Marxist spirit to fight exploitation.\n\n\nEven his political adversaries respected him. He led a justified and honest life. No one could criticize his personal life.\n\nDMK leader C. N. Annadurai saw Jeeva walking down a road, and offered him a ride in his car. Jeeva thanked Annadurai but humbly refused his help.\n\nWhen Communists were proscribed and subject to arrest, Jeeva took refuge in the home of M. R. Radha, a notable stage and cinema actor. Kalaignar Karunanidhi came to the house, and saw a \"sannyasi\" (Hindu renunciate) with a shaved head. He was suspicious of the \"sannyasi\", trying to remember the well known face. Radha entered the room and asked Karunanidhi whether he could recognize the \"sannyasi\". Later Karunanidhi recognized the \"sannyasi\" as Jeeva.\n\nHe and Rajaji were always political rivals but still respected each other.\n\nHe and K. Kamaraj were good allies. On his deathbed, Jeeva told his attendants \"Telegram Padma Vathi [his wife]. Call Kamaraj.\" This shows how close these two leaders were.\n"}
{"id": "35181726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35181726", "title": "Pokémon universe", "text": "Pokémon universe\n\nThe Pokémon universe is a fictional continuity construct that exists within the \"Pokémon\" media franchise, including stories and fictional works produced by The Pokémon Company, Nintendo, Game Freak and Creatures, Inc. The concept of the \"Pokémon\" universe, in both the fictional works and the general nonfictional world of \"Pokémon\", stems from the hobby of insect collecting, a popular pastime which \"Pokémon\" creator Satoshi Tajiri enjoyed as a child. Players of the video games are designated as Pokémon Trainers, and the two general goals (in most Pokémon games) for such Trainers are: to complete the Pokédex by collecting all of the available Pokémon species found in the fictional region where that game takes place; and to train a team of powerful Pokémon to compete against teams owned by other Trainers, and eventually become the strongest Trainer: the Pokémon Master. These themes of collecting, training, and battling are present in almost every version of the Pokémon franchise, including the video game series, the anime series, the manga series, the film series, and the Pokémon Trading Card Game.\n\nThe Pokémon universe takes place in four different locations: the Pokémon world, Deoxys' Unnamed world, Ultra space, and Unknown Dimensions.\n\nThe Pokémon World is the main planet of Pokémon that consists of various landforms and bodies of water and is populated by at least 4,052 people when the populations of every region are combined. The Pokémon World is split into large regions that resemble continents: Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova, Kalos, Alola, and other small islands. The Pokémon World has areas with different biomes like forests, deserts, jungles, and coastal beaches. Hoenn and Sinnoh boast many dramatic environments ranging from rainforests to deserts. The Pokémon World is mainly green and lush, and many wild Pokémon live in grass.\n\nDeoxys' unnamed world is a world that exists in another dimension. It was shown in the Pokémon anime episode \"Pokémon Ranger - Deoxys' Crisis! (Part 1)\". In this episode, Deoxys, a Pokémon, arrived on the Pokémon world in a meteor whose powerful geomagnetic forces hurt Deoxys and forced it to hide in the Pokémon world. To convince Max to help him, Deoxys takes Max to its dimension. After Ash, Brock, May and Solana fight Deoxys to get Max back, Solana use Miltank's Heal Bell to heal him. Afterward. Deoxys flew away.\nAlternate dimensions in the Pokémon universe were first introduced in the fourth generation of Pokémon. Sinnoh mythology states that Sinnoh's legendary Pokémon can access these alternate dimensions.\n\nThe Unown dimension is an alternate space that Unown lives in. This dimension made its debut in \"Spell of the Unknown: Entei\". This dimension appears two more times in episode \"Address Unown!\" and \"The Rise of Darkrai.\" One could transport between Unown Dimension and the real Pokémon Earth through a puzzle box and a portal.\n\nAlso known as the Spirit World, this dimension emits electrical and radio waves and is a shelter of ghost-type Pokémons as well as actual ghosts of Pokémons and people. It first appeared on anime in \"Ghoul Daze!\" and reappeared in \"Scare at the Litwick Mansion.\" The Reaper Cloth, a held item introduced in Generation IV (4), is from the Ghost World.\n\nMirror World is a dimension connected to the Reflection Cave that debuted in the Pokémon XY anime episode \"The Cave of Mirrors!\". In this dimension identical to the Pokémon world, humans and Pokémon are physically and characteristically opposite. In the Mirror World, portals to other worlds in the Cave is considered to be a myth. After sunset, people from different dimensions will be trapped in Mirror World forever.\n\nUltra Space is where Ultra Beasts live. It is connected with Pokémon Earth through Ultra Wormholes, which are unstable portals that the Legendary Pokémon Solgaleo and Lunala can manipulate and create. It is later revealed to be an interdimensional space that connects to alternate universes and worlds in the Multiverse. Cosmog can create Ultra Wormholes as well, but it will most likely die if forced to use this power. Because of this power, it is theorized by the Aether Foundation and the Dimensional Research Lab to be an Ultra Beast. It made its debut in \"Pokémon Sun\" and \"Moon\".\n\nThere are several regions that have appeared in the various media of the \"Pokémon\" franchise. Each of the seven generations of the main series releases focuses on a new region. Moreover, several regions have been introduced in spin-off games, and one in the \"Pokémon\" anime, though most of these are still within the same fictional universe. Usually, the different regions are not accessible from one another via land (or at all within a single game). However, Kanto can be accessed from Johto and vice versa via the sea in \"Pokémon Gold\", \"Silver\", \"Crystal\", \"HeartGold\", and \"SoulSilver\" versions.\n\nEvery region consists of several cities and towns that the player must explore in order to overcome many waiting challenges such as Gyms, Contests, and villainous teams. At different locations within each region, the player can find different types of Pokémon, as well as helpful items and characters. Many regions are on separate continents, though many are based on parts of the real-world country of Japan (and the United States and France in the cases of Unova and Kalos, respectively). Most regions feature locations that have some significance to the story and are unique in that they have unique properties and usually involve myths.\n\nThe Kanto region is the setting of the first generation of \"Pokémon\" games, \"Pokémon Red\", \"Blue\", and \"Yellow\", and their remakes, \"Pokémon FireRed\" and \"LeafGreen\". Based on the real-life Kantō region of Japan, this setting started the precedent of basing the geography and culture of the game's region on a real world setting. This region is also visited in \"Pokémon Gold\", \"Silver\", \"Crystal\", \"HeartGold\", and \"SoulSilver\".\n\nThe antagonists of this region are Team Rocket.\n\nThe three starter Pokémon of this region are Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle, setting the trend of each region's starters being the Grass, Fire, and Water types.\n\nThe Johto region is the setting of the second generation of \"Pokémon\" games, which includes \"Pokémon Gold\", \"Silver\", \"Crystal\", and their remakes, \"Pokémon HeartGold\" and \"SoulSilver\". Again based on an area of Japan, this game's geography is based upon the Kansai, Tokai, and eastern Shikoku areas of the country. The game setting draws upon the Kansai region's abundance of temples, the architectural design of the Kansai region, and its geographical sights, such as Mount Fuji and the Naruto whirlpools.\n\nTeam Rocket once again feature as the antagonists.\n\nThe three starter Pokémon in this region are Chikorita, Cyndaquil, and Totodile.\n\nThe Hoenn region is the setting of the third generation of \"Pokémon\" games, \"Pokémon Ruby\", \"Sapphire\", and \"Emerald\", as well as their remakes \"Pokémon Omega Ruby\" and \"Alpha Sapphire\". This time being based on the Japanese island of Kyushu; the real world and game region share an abundance of smaller islands around the main one and a subtropical climate.\n\nThis setting also introduced two new teams of antagonists, Team Magma and Team Aqua. Only Team Magma appears as an antagonist in \"Ruby\" and \"Omega Ruby\", and only Team Aqua in \"Sapphire\" and \"Alpha Sapphire\". In \"Emerald\", both teams are antagonists. Like Sinnoh, this region is known to have a large range of various natural environments, such as rainforests and deserts.\n\nThe three starter Pokémon in this region are Treecko, Torchic, and Mudkip.\n\nThe Sinnoh region is the setting of the fourth generation of \"Pokémon\" games, which encompasses the setting of \"Pokémon Diamond\", \"Pearl\", and \"Platinum\". It is based on the northernmost island of Japan, Hokkaidō. The region was meant to have a \"northern\" feel, with some routes being entirely covered in snow.\n\nThe antagonists of this region are Team Galactic. The game also introduced Arceus, a secret Pokémon who serves as the creator deity of the Pokémon universe. Like Hoenn, this region is known to have a large range of various natural environments such as rainforests and deserts.\n\nThe three starter Pokémon in this region are Turtwig, Chimchar, and Piplup.\n\nThe Unova region is the setting of the fifth generation of \"Pokémon\" games, which encompasses the setting of \"Pokémon Black\" and \"White\" and their sequels \"Pokémon Black 2\" and \"White 2\". For the first time in the main series, the region was based on a region outside Japan, with Unova taking inspiration from the island of Manhattan.\n\nThe antagonists, Team Plasma, are loosely based on the Knights Templar, though in \"Black 2\" and \"White 2\" they have a pirate motif.\n\nThe three starter Pokémon in this region are Snivy, Tepig, and Oshawott.\n\nThe Kalos region is the setting of the sixth generation of \"Pokémon\" games, which is where the games \"Pokémon X\" and \"Y\" take place. This region is inspired almost entirely by France, with landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower having their own representations here, along with a French style of music and fashion.\n\nThe antagonists of Kalos are Team Flare.\n\nThe three starter Pokémon in this region are Chespin, Fennekin, and Froakie.\n\nThe Alola region is the setting of the seventh generation of \"Pokémon\" games, \"Pokémon Sun\", \"Moon\", \"Ultra Sun\", and \"Ultra Moon\". This region is based on Hawaii, marking the second time a main entry \"Pokémon\" game setting has been inspired by a U.S. state. The name itself is a play on \"aloha\", the Hawaiian word for both \"hello\" and \"goodbye\".\n\nIn \"Pokémon Sun\" and \"Moon\", the antagonists are Team Skull, sporting a punk gang aesthetic. In \"Pokémon Ultra Sun\" and \"Ultra Moon\", Team Rainbow Rocket are introduced as additional antagonists alongside Team Skull, and they are based on the original Team Rocket from the first Pokémon games. Various villainous team leaders from previous generations in the series also make appearances in this sequel.\n\nThe three starter Pokémon in this region are Rowlet, Litten, and Popplio.\n\nAccording to Sinnoh legends, in the beginning, there was nothing but chaos. Then, at the center of the chaos, an egg appeared, from which hatched Arceus. Arceus then created Dialga, the embodiment of time, Palkia, the embodiment of space, and Giratina, who was banished to another dimension as the embodiment of antimatter. Arceus then created Azelf, Mesprit and Uxie; the spirits of willpower, emotion and knowledge respectively. At this early time, Mew the ancestor of Pokémon, appeared in the universe. After creating the Pokémon Earth, Arceus went into an eternal sleep.\n\nAfter Arceus' creation, Groudon, embodiment of the land, Kyogre, embodiment of the sea, and Rayquaza, the sky high Pokémon, were born. They are sometimes unofficially known as \"the weather trio\", as each of these Pokémon possess weather-changing abilities. The clash of these three Pokémon was said to have created much of the Earth's surface. Mountain Coronet, the mountain that the Sinnoh region surrounds, was created at this point of time as Regigigas moved landmass to form continents and regions. Stark Mountain and Heatran were also created at this time.\n\nMany years after, the prehistoric era began and the first prehistoric Pokémon came into being. The games state that scientists proved that prehistoric Pokémon roamed the land, as Fossils and other archaeological remains have been found to contain the DNA of Pokémon. It is possible that the Mew population on the planet may have decreased at this stage, as they slowly gave way to other Pokémon species.\n\nAccording to myths of Sinnoh, Pokémon and people were originally the same species. This theory has not been proven, but it has reappeared many times in Pokémon. Mew is the ancestor of all Pokémon, and the first human recording was in the Stone Age, millions of years before the modern era. There is also scientific evidence that Pokémon are a single species, and the different creatures are subspecies, explaining their ability to interbreed.\n\nIn modern history, the temperature in Sinnoh has dropped dramatically. Team Galactic summons Dialga, Palkia and Giratina to create a portal to the Distortion World, a timespace dimension indicated by the Time-Space Axis in Michina Town.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2093616", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2093616", "title": "Progressor", "text": "Progressor\n\nProgressors in science fiction are people of an advanced space-faring civilization who facilitate progress of less advanced civilizations. It comes from a perspective very much the opposite of what motivates Star Trek's famous Prime Directive.\n\nThe term \"progressor\" was coined by Boris and Arkady Strugatsky for their Noon Universe (1961-1985), the term was mentioned in \"Hard to Be a God\" (1964), and later it (as well as a similar term \"regressor\") was also used by Sergey Lukyanenko in the duology \"The Stars Are Cold Toys\" (1997), although with a somewhat different meaning. Doris Lessing explores the same themes in her \"Canopus in Argos\" series (1979-1983), but she calls it forced evolution. A similar concept is the basis of Iain M. Banks' Culture series (1987-2012); the organization carrying out the work is named \"Special Circumstances\". David Brin's Uplift Universe novels (1980-1998) focus on the closely related phenomenon of biological uplift.\n\nThe aims of the time traveling society in Isaac Asimov's \"The End of Eternity\", which is constantly interfering with, changing and \"improving\" history, are in many ways similar.\n\nStrugatsky's progressors are agents of the Institute of Experimental History (IEH), in some cases indirectly controlled by two Committees for Contacts with Other Civilizations (COMCONs). They are working only with human civilizations, apparently, not daring to \"progress\" non-human races, like Leoniders or Headies, with whom Earth prefers to keep a full scaled diplomatic contact. Aware of a possible xenophobia, progressors usually employ stealth and secrecy to work undercover, allowing only a few of the brightest and most trustworthy individuals on a planet to know their true background.\n\nThe idea of progressorism is to \"straighten the history\", i.e. to facilitate the way of primitive civilizations to Noon Universe-like condition and is based on the fictional \"theory of Historical Consequences\", which determines \"what is good or bad, right or not in history\". Progressors diminish casualties, inflicted by historical processes or inevitable crises. However, they don't hesitate to kill in order to survive (or to achieve other goals). This contradicts the usual mindset of the Noon Universe, according to which every \"bearer of reason\" is a priori ethically equivalent to oneself. It's why most humans don't like progressors. \n\nIn \"Hard to Be a God\", collaborators of the Institute (such as don Rumata) are merely observers/historians gathering material for the theory of Historical Consequences, and saving scientists and poets is their personal activity. True progressors appear not earlier than in \"Inhabited Island\" and \"Beetle in an Anthill\".\n\nWanderers seem to \"progress\" some civilizations (including Earth), too, being ahead of humans in every aspect, from secrecy to efficiency. However, Leonid Gorbovsky thinks of this possibility as a ridiculous one:\n\nThe middle of the 22nd century was a boom for IEH and progressors. Here are some of their most famous projects.\n\n\nAfter 2162 the public opinion has, apparently, forced \"Institute of Experimental History\" to stop initiating new projects.\n\nUnlike Strugatky's progressors who were selfless knights of altruism and science, Lukyanenko's ones are mere an instrument of power employed by the government of one of the most technologically advanced civilizations in the universe described in \"The Stars Are Cold Toys\" and \"Star Shadow\". This civilization (called \"Geometers (Геометры)\", because of their love for order: e.g. they even reshaped the two continents of their home planet to resemble a circle and a square) bears a striking resemblance to the Earth of Noon Universe. In both, upbringing of a person is fulfilled by teachers not parents. But while Teachers of the Noon Universe help to develop the brightest sides of a personality and to form morally brought up person, Mentors of Geometers tend to meet the needs of society — forming good mannered people, unable to violate any rules of the society at all. The author himself commented that he wasn't really sure that a system described by Strugatsky brothers could function properly and presented his own vision of it.\n\nGeometers were obsessed with an idea of building an interstellar brotherhood of all kinds of races (in other words, a form of imperialism — a doctrine not common in Noon Universe). But while it's impossible to change the ideology of an advanced society by force, Geometers use \"regressors\" to exterminate technology of the planet to the level, at which inhabitants will easily accept ideas of Friendship. This is where \"progressors\" came in: they raise the technological and social level, while bringing up races in the \"true\" way.\n"}
{"id": "37463819", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37463819", "title": "Proto-Samic language", "text": "Proto-Samic language\n\nThe Proto-Samic language is the hypothetical, reconstructed common ancestor of the Sami languages. It is a descendant of the Proto-Uralic language.\n\nAlthough the current Sami languages are spoken much further to the north and west, Proto-Samic was likely spoken in the area of modern-day Southwestern Finland around the first few centuries CE. Local (in Sápmi) ancestors of the modern Sami people likely still spoke non-Uralic, \"Paleoeuropean\" languages at this point (see Pre-Finno-Ugric substrate). This situation can be traced in placenames as well as through the analysis of loanwords from Germanic, Baltic and Finnic. Evidence also can be found for the existence of language varieties closely related to but likely distinct from Samic proper having been spoken further east, with a limit around Lake Beloye.\n\nSeparation of the main branches (West Samic and East Samic) is also likely to have occurred in southern Finland, with these later independently spreading north into Sápmi. The exact routes of this are not clear: it is possible Western Sami entered Scandinavia across Kvarken rather than via land. Concurrently, Finnic languages that would eventually end up becoming modern-day Finnish and Karelian were being adopted in the southern end of the Proto-Samic area, likely in connection with the introduction of agriculture, a process that continued until the 19th century, leading to the extirpation of original Samic languages in Karelia and all but northernmost Finland.\n\nThe Proto-Samic consonant inventory is mostly faithfully retained from Proto-Uralic, and is considerably smaller than what is typically found in modern Sami languages. There were 16 contrastive consonants, most of which could however occur both short and geminate:\nStop and affricate consonants were split in three main allophones with respect to phonation:\n\nThe spirant also had two allophones, voiceless occurring word-initially and syllable-finally, and voiced elsewhere.\n\nA detailed system of allophony is reconstructible, known as consonant gradation. Gradation applied to all intervocalic single consonants as well as all consonant clusters. This is unlike gradation in the related Proto-Finnic and its descendants, where it applied only to a subset. The conditioning factor was the same, however: the weak grade occurred if the following syllable was closed, the strong grade if it was open. This difference was originally probably realized as length:\n\n\nGradation only applied after a stressed syllable; after an unstressed syllable all medial consonants appeared in the weak grade.\n\nIn sources on Proto-Samic reconstruction, gradation is often assumed but not indicated graphically. In this article, when it is relevant and necessary to show the distinction, the weak grade is denoted with an inverted breve below the consonant(s): \"s\" : \"s̯\", \"č\" : \"č̯\", \"tt\" : \"t̯t̯\", \"lk\" : \"l̯k̯\".\n\nAfter the phonematization of gradation due to loss of word-final sounds, Samic varieties could be left with as many as four different contrastive degrees of consonant length. This has only been attested in some dialects of Ume Sami. Most other Samic varieties phonemically merged the weak grade of geminates with the strong grade of single consonants, leaving only three lengths. In some Samic languages, other sound developments have left only two or three degrees occurring elsewhere.\n\nAn asymmetric system of four short and five long vowel segments can be reconstructed.\n\n\nStress was not phonemic in Proto-Samic. The first syllable of a word invariably received primary stress. Non-initial syllables of a word received secondary stress, according to a trochaic pattern of alternating secondarily-stressed and unstressed syllables. Odd-numbered syllables (counting from the start) were stressed, while even-numbered syllables were unstressed. The last syllable of a word was never stressed. Thus, a word could end in either a stressed syllable followed by an unstressed syllable (if the last syllable was even-numbered) or a stressed syllable followed by two unstressed syllables (if the last syllable was odd-numbered). This gave the following pattern, which could be extended indefinitely (P = primary stress, S = secondary stress, _ = no stress):\n\nBecause the four diphthongs could only occur in stressed syllables, this stress pattern often led to alternations between vowels in different forms of the same word. More crucially, it led to alternations in inflectional endings between different words, depending on whether the second-last syllable of that word was stressed or not.\n\nThis alternation survives in many Samic languages in the form of distinct inflectional classes, with words with a stressed second-last syllable following the so-called \"even\" or \"two-syllable\" inflection, and words with an unstressed second-last syllable following the \"odd\" or \"three-syllable\" inflection. Weakening and simplification of non-final consonants after unstressed syllables contributed further to the alternation, leading to differences that are sometimes quite striking. For example:\n\nIn compounds, which consisted of a combination of several root words, each word retained the stress pattern that it had in isolation, so that that stress remained lexically significant (i.e. could theoretically distinguish compounds from non-compounds). The first syllable of the first part of a compound had the strongest stress, with progressively weaker secondary stress for the first syllables of the remaining parts.\n\nNominals, i.e. nouns, adjectives, numerals and pronouns were systematically inflected for two numbers and ten cases. The personal pronouns and possessive suffixes also distinguished the dual number.\n\nThe cases included the core cases nominative, accusative and genitive; the local cases inessive, elative, illative; as well as essive, partitive, comitative and abessive.\n\nSeveral of the singular cases do not have a clear counterpart in the plural, or have different formations ancestral to different Sami languages. For example, what would later become the accusative plural developed out of the partitive plural form, while the inessive plural is the original essive plural form. The comitative plural was in origin a periphrastic construction consisting of the genitive plural with the noun \"*kuojmē\" \"companion\". It is likely that the case system was still partially in development during the late Proto-Samic period, and developed in subtly different ways in the various descendants.\n\nIn most Samic languages, the case system has been simplified:\n\n\nThe following non-finite forms were also present:\n\nThe vocabulary reconstructible for Proto-Samic has been catalogued by Lehtiranta (1989), who records approximately 1500 word roots, for which either a pre-Samic ancestry is assured, or whose distribution across the Sami languages reaches at least from Lule Sami to Skolt Sami. Within this sample, loanwords from the Finnic and Scandinavian languages already constitute major subsets, numbering slightly over 150 and 100, respectively.\n\n\nThis approximate point of Pre-Samic marks the introduction of the oldest Western Indo-European loanwords from Baltic and Germanic. Loans were also acquired from its southern relative Finnic, substituting the early Finnic sound with Samic . Likely contemporary to these were the oldest loanwords adapted from extinct Paleo-European languages during the northwestward expansion of Pre-Samic. Prime suspects for words of this origin include replacements of Uralic core vocabulary, or words that display consonant clusters that cannot derive from either PU or any known Indo-European source. A number of the later type can be found in the Finnic languages as well.\n\nExamples:\n\nLater consonant changes mostly involved the genesis of the consonant gradation system, but also the simplification of various consonant clusters, chiefly in loanwords.\n\nA fairly late but major development within Samic was a complete upheaval of the vowel system, which has been compared in scope to the Great Vowel Shift of English.\n\nThe previous changes left a system consisting of in the first syllable in Pre-Samic, and probably at least long . In unstressed syllables, only were distinguished. The source of is unclear, although it is frequently also found in Finnic.\n\nThe table below shows the main correspondences:\n\nThe processes that added up to this shift can be outlined as follows:\n\n\nAt this point, the vowel system consisted of only two short vowels in initial syllables, alongside the full complement of long vowels . In non-initial syllables, the vowels were . After this, several metaphonic changes then occurred that rearranged the distribution of long vowels in stressed syllables.\n\n suggests the following four phases:\n\nThe inventory of long vowels in stressed syllables now featured seven members: . However, in native vocabulary remained in complementary distribution: the closed-mid vowel only occurred before following , the open-mid vowel only before following , .\n\nFurther changes then shifted the sound values of the unstressed syllables that had conditioned the above shift:\n\nLastly, a number of unconditional shifts adjusted the sound values of the vowel phonemes.\n\nTo what extent the two last changes should be dated to Proto-Samic proper is unclear. Although all Sami languages show these changes in at least some words, in Southern Sami and Ume Sami earlier , , , are regularly reflected as \"ij\", \"i\", \"u\", \"uv\" in stressed open syllables. It is possible that these are archaisms, and shortening and lowering occurred only after the initial division of Proto-Samic into dialects.\nThe effects of the vowel shift can be illustrated by the following comparison between Northern Sami, and Finnish, known for retaining vowel values very close to Proto-Uralic. All word pairs correspond to each other regularly:\n\nThe main division among the Sami languages is the split between eastern and western Samic.\n\nChanges that appear across the Eastern-Western divide are:\n\nInnovations common to the Western Samic languages:\n\nThe Southern West Samic languages consist of Southern Sami and Ume Sami, and have a number of further innovations:\n\nThe Northern West Samic languages consist of Pite Sami, Lule Sami and Northern Sami. They have one important common innovation:\n\nPite Sami and Lule Sami form their own smaller subgroup of shared innovations, which might be termed Northwestern West Samic:\n\nNorthern Sami by itself has its own unique changes:\n\nThe Eastern Samic languages have the following innovations:\n\nThe Mainland East Samic languages, Inari Sami, Skolt Sami and Akkala Sami, share further innovations:\n\nSkolt and Akkala Sami moreover share:\n\nPeninsular East (Kola) Samic, consisting of Kildin Sami and Ter Sami, share:\n\nReflexes in parentheses are retentions found in certain subdialects. In particular, in the coastal dialects of North Sami (known as Sea Sami), several archaisms have been attested, including a lack of pre-stopping of geminate nasals, a lack of -vocalization, and a reflex /e/ of in certain positions. These likely indicate an earlier Eastern Samic substratum.\n\nIn the history of Proto-Samic, some sound changes were triggered or prevented by the nature of the vowel in the next syllable. Such changes continued to occur in the modern Sami languages, but differently in each. Due to the similarity with Germanic umlaut, these phenomena are termed \"umlaut\" as well.\n\nThe following gives a comparative overview of each possible Proto-Samic vowel in the first syllable, with the outcomes that are found in each language for each second-syllable vowel.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "35543293", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35543293", "title": "Rock music and the fall of communism", "text": "Rock music and the fall of communism\n\nRock music played a role in subverting the political order of the Soviet Union and its satellites. The attraction of the unique form of music served to undermine Soviet authority by humanizing the West, helped alienate a generation from the political system, and sparked a youth revolution. This contribution was achieved not only through the use of words or images, but through the structure of the music itself. Furthermore, the music was spread as part of a broad public diplomacy effort, commercial ventures, and through the efforts of the populace in the Eastern Bloc.\n\nThe stilyagi, the first youth counterculture movement in the Soviet Union, emerged in the 1950s. The stilyagi, meaning stylish in Russian, listened to the music and copied the western fashion trends. Unlike later youth movements, the regime made no attempt to infiltrate and channel the movement toward their own ends, opting instead for public oppression. The stilyagi virtually disappeared by the early 1960s because many restrictions on the flow of information were relaxed, showing that the styles the stilyagi drew inspiration from were outdated.\n\nThe 6th World Festival of Youth and Students took place in Moscow in 1957, permitting jazz and western forms of dance for one of the first times in the Soviet Union. Although there was some hope that this was an indication of relaxation of restrictions, by the end of the 1950s, Eastern Bloc countries began arresting stilyagi and rock fans. In 1958, partially in response to these events, NATO published a report speculating on the intentional use of rock music for subversive purposes.\n\nThe Beatles sparked the love of rock in the Soviet youth and its popularity spread in the early 1960s. Their impact on fashion was one of the more obvious external signs of their popularity. \"Collarless Beatles jackets, known as 'Bitlovka', were assembled from cast-offs; clumsy army boots were refashioned in Beatles style.\" In addition to their influence in fashion, they also helped drive the expansion of music in the black market. Illicit music albums were created by recording copies onto discarded X-ray emulsion plates. The music itself was acquired either by smuggling copies from the west, or recording it from western radio. The latter became easier and more common after United States president Lydon Johnson made international broadcasting a priority in the mid-1960s.\n\nHippie culture emerged in the late 60s and early 70s. Although very similar in terms of aesthetic to their western cousins, Soviet hippies were more passive. The Soviet hippie movement did not develop the same radical social and political sensibilities as did the New Left in the United States. Elsewhere in the eastern bloc, however, rockers and hippies were quite politically active and in the Prague Spring of 1968 numerous concerts were held in support of greater liberalization.\n\nThe major development for rock behind the Iron Curtain in the 1970s was original songs written in the authors' native language. Bands like Illés in Hungary, the Plastic People of the Universe in Czechoslovakia, and Time Machine in the Soviet Union adapted their native languages to rock. They managed to enjoy a steady following, unlike similar attempts by other bands in the 1960s, although they were mostly underground. The mainstream was dominated by VIAs (vocal instrument ensembles) which were officially sanctioned rock and pop groups whose lyrics were vetted and whose music was considerably tamer than the underground groups. The East German government even established a bureau for rock, indicating their desire to gain control of the movement.\n\nAlthough the Seventies were mainly a doldrums for Soviet rock fans, resistance to official policy would still erupt from time to time elsewhere in the bloc, particularly East Germany. Even in places where rock's suppression did not produce violent reactions, like Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union itself, the underground continued to flourish, creating a \"second culture\", which would have dramatic effects in the future.\n\nIn 1980, the Tbilisi Rock Festival was held. The festival was significant because the bands that generated the most \"buzz\" were not official VIA groups but underground acts like Aquarium. As the 80s progressed, more authentic and \"street\" oriented groups would gain popularity. Mike Naumenko upset the status quo of even the underground with frank lyrics about life in the Soviet Union; he even addressed taboo subjects such as sex in songs like \"Outskirts Blues\" and \"Ode to the Bathroom\". A result of this greater enthusiasm for a genuine native rock scene was a burgeoning home-made album movement. Bands would simply make their own albums; many artists would record copies by using personal reel to reel machines. The finished products were often complete with album art and liner notes, bringing a greater level of quality and sophistication to amateur recordings. By the mid-eighties, under pressure from the Composers' Union and out of concern for the negative effects of rock, the underground and rock music were effectively outlawed. Clubs were closed, rock journalists were censored, popular underground bands were criticized in the press, and official bands were forced to play songs written by the Composers' Union. Elsewhere in the Eastern Bloc, punk was beginning to take hold due to dissatisfaction with political and economic situation for the youth in Czechoslovakia and East Germany.\n\nIn 1985, with the election of Gorbachev and the inauguration of glasnost and perestroika, official attitudes toward rock music became much more permissive. At the 12th International Festival of Youth and Students, foreign bands were allowed to play. They ranged from English rock bands, to Finnish punks, to a reggae group that ritually smoked ganja in red square. All these changes inspired the new slang word of the day tusovka - \"meaning something's happening, some kind of mess, some activity.\" When the Rock Lab Festival took place in 1986, the tusovka spirit was on display with Zvuki Mu front man Peter Mamonov singing lyrics like:\n\nAfter the Chernobyl disaster, a benefit concert was organized. When government bureaucrats attempted to enforce compliance with a series of regulations and paperwork, the artists and planners simply ignored their requests. There was no official reprimand, confiscation of instruments, or violence from the police in response, something unthinkable even a few years prior. More signs of dissent occurred; at a festival in Petersburg shortly after, the band Televisor stirred the crowd with a song entitled 'Get Out Of Control':\n\nAll over the Eastern Bloc, resistance to rock was being worn down. In 1987, David Bowie, Genesis, and the Eurythmics played in West Berlin. Radio in the American Sector announced the lineup and time well before hand and the concert planners pointed the speakers over the wall so that East Berliners would be ready and could enjoy the concert. When East German security forces tried to disband the crowd of fans assembled by the wall, the fans promptly rioted, chanting \"tear down the wall!\" In 1988, a similar situation erupted when Michael Jackson performed in West Berlin, and the security forces, while trying to disperse the fans, even attacked western camera crews that were filming the scene. In an attempt to improve their image, the East German government invited Bruce Springsteen to play in July. No more violence erupted, but the crowd enthusiastically sang to \"Born in the USA\", while clutching small hand-painted American flags; something which the official press neglected to mention. Additionally, Springsteen said: \"I am not for or against any government. I have come here to play rock and roll for you East Berliners in the hope that one day all barriers can be torn down\", showing both his understanding of the restrictions East Germans faced and avoiding the impression that he was playing in support of the East German government. A few months after that concert, Erich Honecker, the leader of East Germany, resigned. The Berlin Wall itself collapsed before the year ended.\n\nThomas Nichols, in \"Winning the World,\" holds that the ideological pronouncements of the Soviet State required that virtually all actions be seen in terms of political import. For example, KGB documents show that the intelligence agency interpreted vigils for John Lennon in 1980 as protests against the regime. The song In the Navy by the Village People was even described by the Soviet press as supporting militarism, an inaccurate claim seeing as the lyrics are a series of thinly veiled references to homosexual behavior. This extreme rigidity in ideology made the Soviet system especially weak in terms of adapting to social changes, and very open to human rights critiques and ridicule.\n\nArtemy Troitsky contends that rock music inspired the same sort of youth revolution that occurred in the west, but the Soviet system could not adapt to the resulting social upheaval. Throughout his book on the Soviet rock movement, Back in the USSR, he describes rock as a virus invading a host body. He also gives accounts of Soviet leadership and bureaucrats describing rock as a form of infection or a virus, supporting his virus metaphor. The main route for \"infection\" from \"alien influences,\" in his view, came from the problem of permeable borders. The system could never effectively block out all outside influence, nor could it adapt to the ones that came through.\n\nLeslie Woodhead, in the 2009 documentary \"How the Beatles Rocked the Kremlin,\" argues that rock music, and the Beatles in particular, alienated the youth against the leadership of the Soviet bloc governments. Artemy Troistky, who appeared in the documentary, asserted that the Beatles' appeal reached religious heights. Woodhead supported this assertion by showcasing fan testimony about the Beatles' ubiquitous popularity and the extent to which it still permeates Russian popular culture.\n\nThe debate over the role of rock in the US public diplomacy effort began almost as soon as it became popular, and lasted through the Reagan administration. \"Rock music was blasted to through the Iron Curtain through government-subsidized Voice of America and Radio Free Europe, and we interviewed the legal counsel for VOA who described the debates inside the Reagan administration about the appropriateness of sending \"degenerate\" rock music eastward. But even the advisory boards came to understand that it was the structure of rock, as much as the lyrics, that counted.\" \n\nIn the mid-60s President Johnson expressed his desire to build cultural and economic bridges with the Soviet Union. This drove intensified radio broadcasts by the VOA, BBC, RFE, and Radio Luxembourg into the Iron Curtain, especially musical programming. All of this was viewed by the Soviets as an overt political subversion campaign. Nevertheless, the Soviet-bloc responded by increasing domestic broadcasts of pop and rock, or big beat as they called it. The results of this saturation of the airwaves with popular music was revealed in a 1966 RFE study of requests from behind the Iron Curtain. The study showed that the taste in music among teenagers from the east and west were largely identical.\n\nAlthough American funding and support for such broadcasting varied, their broadcasting remained popular. KGB memos asserted that, at one point, 80% of Soviet youth listed to western broadcasts. In addition to the basic popularity of western broadcasts and whatever role that played in undermining the Soviets politically, by the mid 1980's the Soviets were spending more than three billion dollars to jam or block RFE and Radio Liberty broadcasts. Václav Havel attributed this continuous appeal to the inherent rebelliousness of rock music, at least at the time.\n\nMagnitizdat were DIY recordings that were the audio counterpart to the written Samizdat. Many of the early DIY recordings were made from plastic X-ray plates Rock fans and black marketeers would smuggle records in from the west and would steal discarded X-Ray emulsion plates from dumpsters and garbage cans at hospitals. They would then bring their X-Ray plates and records into small recording studios, which were designed so that Soviet soldiers could record audio messages for family back home. Because the X-ray plates were flexible, they could be rolled and hidden in a sleeve which aided in the concealment and transport of the record. The recordings would still bear images of human skeletons, so they were referred to as \"bones,\" \"ribs,\" or \"roentgenizdat\". This practice began in the 50s, but proliferated in the 60s especially as Beatlemania spread.\n\nIt didn't take long before Soviet youth wanted to form bands to emulate the Fab Four, but the lack of instruments was a serious impediment to the formation of rock bands. Soviet youths had to improvise. They did so by creating their own guitars by sawing old tables into the shape of a guitar. Creating pickups and amps was a problem until an inspired young electrical engineer discovered that they could be created from phone receivers and loudspeakers, respectively. The only readily available sources for these items were public telephone booths and speakers used for propaganda broadcasts, so young rockers would vandalize both for parts.\n\nFrom the early to mid sixties, the subculture was mostly ignored by the authorities. That is not to stay that fans could display their love for rock openly, but it wasn't actively persecuted until later. Most of these new bands would imitate the Beatles as best they could with their improvised instruments, and even clothing fashioned after Beatles stage costumes. They would play anywhere they could; cafes, front stoops, basements, dormitories; anywhere they could convince someone to let them. As the bands became more sophisticated and popular, rock scenes began to develop. How the authorities would react depended greatly upon the area and the time period. From the late 60s on, long haired men often would have their offending manes cut and bands would be denied official status, financial support, press coverage, and permission to play in bigger venues. In their place VIA's (the Russian acronym for vocal/instrumental ensemble), officially sanctioned bands were established to play state approved music and lyrics with less \"teeth.\" VIA's would avoid controversial topics in their lyrics, musical styles, or anything deemed \"degenerate\".\n\nDespite the attempts to stifle the native rock movement, the underground survived and managed to create a different culture that many would flee to. Identification with this subculture would make one less susceptible to Soviet propaganda and ideology and less likely to view the West as a threat. \"The kids lost their interest in all Soviet unshakeable dogmas and ideals, and stopped thinking of an English-speaking person as an enemy. That's when the Communists lost two generations of young people. That was an incredible impact.\" Even if the individual did not enjoy rock for political reasons, because the political system was opposed to it, merely listening to music was an act of disobedience. By extension, active participation in the underground made one an active agent against the regime, as far as the leadership was concerned. Some of the more dedicated songwriters would go to great lengths to conceal their dissent, which was described in \"Rockin' the Wall\": \"The trick was, [ Leslie Mandoki ] noted in the film, to write a \"rat tail.\" The rat tail was a song that ostensibly was about Ronald Reagan or the United States or capitalism—and would therefore clear censors—but which was obvious to all the kids to be a criticism of the Soviet system.\" The inability of the Communist regimes to eradicate, replace, or assimilate the influence of rock music probably did much to ensure that the populace would turn against the totalitarian system.\n\n\n"}

Warren. It stars Candace Glendenning as a young woman who, after surviving a car accident in which her parents are seemingly killed, is taken in by her uncle and cousin (Michael Gough and Martin Potter), unaware that they are both necromancers who intend to sacrifice her to resurrect the spirit of a supernaturally-gifted ancestor.\n\nThe film, a production of Warren's newly-formed company Monumental Pictures, was funded by producers Les Young and Richard Crafter with their own money and shot almost entirely on location in Pirbright, Surrey and Shepherd's Bush, London in late 1975. The following year, re-shoots were undertaken to film additional material and more violent, alternative versions of existing scenes with the aim of increasing the film's appeal to audiences in the Far East.\n\nIn the UK, \"Satan's Slave\" was originally released as a B movie. Critical reception of the film has been mixed, with aspects such as the acting, script and plot attracting a range of responses.\n\nCatherine Yorke, a young woman from London, receives a bracelet from her boyfriend, John, for her upcoming birthday. She then leaves the city with her parents, Malcolm and Elizabeth, to join her father's brother, Alexander, for a week at his home in the country. At the turn into Alexander's estate, Malcolm suddenly falls ill at the wheel of the family car and crashes it into a tree. Although the vehicle is only lightly damaged, when Catherine steps outside it mysteriously explodes, seemingly killing her parents.\n\nAlexander, assisted by his son Stephen and secretary Frances, takes the distraught Catherine into the house and gives her a sedative. On waking, Catherine finds that the driveway has been cleared of wreckage and is told that the police have concluded their investigation into her parents' deaths. The funeral is conducted later that day in the grounds of the estate. After the ceremony, Catherine finds an old gravestone inscribed with the name of Camilla Yorke, a young woman said to have died at the age of 20 – the age that Catherine will soon reach.\n\nOver the next few days, as she continues to be hosted by Alexander, Catherine experiences disturbing visions of women being branded, flogged and sacrificed in Satanic rituals. She finds herself drawn to Stephen, with whom she becomes romantically involved. Meanwhile, with the aid of the bracelet that he has stolen from Catherine, Alexander uses dark magic to compel John to kill himself by jumping from the roof of a tower block.\n\nFrances tells Catherine that Camilla, an ancestor of the Yorke family, possessed supernatural abilities. Now Alexander, a believer in necromancy, intends to resurrect Camilla's spirit to increase his own power. Having murdered several women, including his own wife, to test his theories, he has determined that this can be achieved only through the sacrifice of Catherine, Camilla's direct descendant, when she turns 20 – Camilla's age at the time of her death. Frances also warns Catherine not to trust Stephen: having witnessed his mother's sacrifice as a young boy he has grown up to become a murderer like his father.\n\nWhen he discovers Frances' betrayal, Stephen stabs her to death and locks Catherine in her bedroom. On the morning of her birthday, Catherine is led into the nearby woods to be sacrificed by Alexander and his cult but escapes after running a nail file through Stephen's eye. At the entrance to the estate she runs into her father, who claims that both he and her mother survived the car accident. She is taken back to the house, where Alexander, no longer wearing his ritual robes, claims that her recent experiences were merely hallucinations brought on by the sedative. However, his deception is uncovered when Catherine pulls back a curtain to find Stephen's corpse. Alexander praises Catherine's brutality and hails her as a true descendant of Camilla. It is then revealed that Catherine's father, not her uncle, is the head of the cult. Trapped, Catherine screams and the picture fades to shots of another human sacrifice.\n\nCritic Adam Locks notes that \"Satan's Slave\" features plot devices typical of horror films of the 1970s, such as settings that represent \"nowhere places\" in which characters become lost. He argues that the Yorkes' car journey has an effect similar to time travel, writing that it serves as a \"re-programming for the audience with memories and associations disconnected from the modern and the urban ... In psychogeographical terms of the relationship between the individual and space, there is the clichéd yet interesting idea of the road leading to nowhere.\"\n\nLocks also compares \"Satan's Slave\", along with other Warren films, to the 1960s TV series \"The Avengers\" for the way in which it conveys an \"underlying disquiet\" about its setting: \"Behind the façade of mundane England, threatening figures or forces – be they crooks in \"The Avengers\" or Satanists in \"Satan's Slave\" ... – plan to disrupt the everyday world.\" He writes that through this sense of unease \"the familiarity of 'Englishness' is transformed and warped.\"\n\nLeon Hunt, author of \"British Low Culture: from Safari Suits to Sexploitation\", regards the conclusion to \"Satan's Slave\" as representative of a trend towards \"downbeat\" endings in \"generation-gap\" British horror films during the 1970s, contrasting this with the \"angry\", \"anti-authoritarian\" style of Michael Reeves' films of the 1960s. He observes that \"Satan's Slave\" ends with Catherine trapped by members of her own family and about to be \"consumed\", commenting: \"The battle is over and 'youth' has lost.\"\n\nLocks describes Alexander as an \"atavistic amalgamation of various icons of British gentlemen\" – among them the \"chivalrous knight\", whose moral code he inverts through the planned sacrifice of his niece and the actual sacrifice of his wife. Warren believes that both the character and his house are influenced by the style of contemporary Hammer horror films.\n\nAfter making \"Her Private Hell\" (1968) and \"Loving Feeling\" (1969), Norman J. Warren had been in negotiations to direct films for Amicus Productions and American International Pictures. When these deals fell through, Warren and Les Young, who had served as camera operator on the earlier films, agreed to make a film of their own.\n\n\"Satan's Slave\" is Warren's horror debut as well as the first release of Monumental Pictures, an independent film production company that Warren formed with Young, Young's wife Moira and another camera operator, Richard Crafter. With their limited means restricting their choice of genre to either erotic or horror, the four chose to make a horror film on the basis that it would enjoy a longer \"shelf life\". The decision to produce the film independently was made after several failed attempts to secure a financing deal. Ultimately Crafter and Les Young funded the production with their own money: the former by selling his shares in the retailer Mothercare, the latter by selling his car and mortgaging his home and film equipment rental company, Crystal Film Productions. As labour union rules prohibited him from officially performing more than one role in the production, Warren was credited only as director. He gives the total budget as either £30,000 or £35,000, about half of which took the form of deferred payments.\n\nThe story was devised by Warren and the Youngs and expanded by screenwriter David McGillivray, whom Warren had first met while editing \"Her Private Hell\". McGillivray completed the script in nine days. Warren did not want the script to end with a revelation that the events of the film had been a nightmare as he considered dream sequences to be clichéd. Though reluctant to edit the film, believing that this would result in a creative conflict of interest with his directorial responsibilities, Warren ultimately accepted the dual role as he \"so much wanted this film to happen\".\n\nWarren says that Candace Glendenning, whom he had seen in films such as \"Tower of Evil\" (1972), was \"always [his] first choice\" to play Catherine. Due to the character's complexity, the role of Stephen was harder to cast. Martin Potter, who had recently played the title role in the TV serial \"The Legend of Robin Hood\", was hired after first choice actor Michael Gothard withdrew at a late stage of pre-production. Potter researched psychopathic behaviour to better understand his part.\n\nAlthough the production could not afford to pay Michael Gough's usual fee, the actor accepted the role of Uncle Alexander after reading McGillivray's script and hearing Warren's personal vision for the film. His participation was conditional on the crew scheduling the filming around his theatre commitments. Gough was paid £300 () for his appearance.\n\nJames Bree and Celia Hewitt were cast through Spotlight. Michael Craze had worked with Warren before, having appeared in his short film \"Fragment\" (1965).\n\nThe film was largely shot in and around the country house of the Baron and Baroness DeVeuce in Pirbright, Surrey over three weeks in December 1975. The house had previously appeared in Tigon's \"Virgin Witch\" (1971) and would also be used as a shooting location for Warren's later film, \"Terror\" (1978). Warren remembers the challenges that the production was facing due to the low budget and how production designer Hayden Pearce found the DeVeuce house: \"Most places were not suitable or the people were not interested. And because we didn't have any money, we needed a house that also had furniture in it. Hayden was ringing everyone he knew in connection to art departments and someone suggested the mock-Tudor house in Pirbright, and we couldn't believe our luck. Not only did it look great outside but everything in there was genuine - there were wall-to-wall paintings and it was fully dressed.\" The estate surrounding the property contained an electrical substation that the crew were allowed to use as a power source, eliminating the need for generators. A nearby cottage served as the location for the Yorkes' London home.\n\nDue to budget limitations both Gough and Potter supplied their own wardrobe. Gough, who could not be provided with hotel accommodation, stayed with a friend in Barnes, London throughout the filming. Warren remembers: \"We would pick him up each day at around 5.45 a.m. ... He would work with us all day, often until midnight, and then we would drive him back to his friend's house, stopping on the way to buy fish and chips.\" He adds that \"even with the incredibly long hours we worked each day, [Gough] never had a word of complaint.\" Various members of the crew, including the producers, appear in the film as hooded cultists. Moira Young took over the role of the woman who is sacrificed in the opening scene when the actress who had been cast failed to attend on the night of filming.\n\nWhile filming on a hill near an Army base, the production found itself surrounded by soldiers conducting a training exercise. Due to the noise from the base's shooting range, the production schedule was revised to avoid filming outdoors on the days when it was in use. For the scene in which the Yorkes' car explodes, the crew were given permission to film on the base; the Army then used the wreckage for target practice before disposing of it.\n\nScenes set inside John's flat were filmed at the home of one of the crew. The character's suicide was shot at a block of flats in Shepherd's Bush, with producer Les Young serving as the stunt double for Michael Craze. To create a first-person \"falling\" effect, a camera was tied to a bungee cord and then dropped from the roof of the 23-storey building. The car crash stunt was also performed by Young. \n\nPrincipal photography was completed shortly before Christmas 1975. Warren then edited the film at home. While preparing the first cut, Warren and his colleagues decided that the film contained an overabundance of dialogue and shortened or removed certain scenes that they considered redundant. These included a dream sequence involving Catherine and a scene set after the funeral in which the Yorkes bond over tea and Alexander and Stephen learn of the existence of Catherine's boyfriend. According to Warren, \"the main problem with [\"Satan's Slave\"] was that the plot was very complicated, and actually rather boring. So we just cut out complete scenes where people were explaining things. And a lot of the film doesn't make sense because of those cuts. But it was less complicated, and no one ever questioned the plot.\"\n\nTo boost distribution prospects in the Far East, it was also decided to re-edit the film to include larger amounts of gore and nudity. This involved shooting a more explicit version of an early scene in the film, in which Stephen attempts to rape and then murders a young woman, Janice (played by Gloria Walker). Warren considers this version, in which Stephen ties his victim to a bed and threatens to cut off her nipples with scissors, \"very unpleasant\" and expresses his preference for the original. Additional scenes written by Warren and filmed during the re-shoots include Catherine's vision of a Puritan priest (played by McGillivray) overseeing the torture of a young woman, which was filmed in the grounds of a nursing home. McGillivray also has a speaking role in the film as the priest who conducts the funeral of Catherine's parents. Various cutaway shots were also filmed by Crystal Film Productions.\n\nThe score, composed by John Scott, was recorded in a single session with seven instrumentalists – the largest ensemble that the budget would allow. It features a clarinet and various gong effects, supported by a piano, xylophone, xylorimba and vibraphone.\n\nThe film's title was changed from \"Evil Heritage\" to \"Satan's Slave\" during post-production after distributors Brent Walker suggested that the latter was \"more commercial\". \n\n\"Satan's Slave\" was released in December 1976. In the UK, it was distributed as the B movie in a double feature with \"Thriller\", an American International Pictures release. It was also paired with \"Ruby\". \"Satan's Slave\" was commercially successful and was re-released five times during the 1970s. Its box office revenue was used to fund Warren's subsequent film, \"Terror\".\n\nThe film was distributed by Crown International Pictures in the United States, where it had only a limited release.\n\nIn a contemporary review for \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\", Michael Grossbard described \"Satan's Slave\" as \"basically an archaic second feature\" that \"looks ... like the sort of subject likely to turn up on Sunday afternoon children's television, with its kids-in-trouble/blame-the-older-generation theme.\" He considered the plot \"well constructed and written\" and the performances \"never below standard, though it would be nice to see Michael Gough in more demanding parts.\"\n\n\"Satan's Slave\" continues to divide critical opinion. \"TV Guide\" magazine calls the film a \"vile shocker ... full of unappetising gore effects\". \"Time Out\" considers it an \"absolute stinker\", criticising its dialogue and \"dragged-out\" theme. Awarding the film three stars out of five, David Parkinson of \"Radio Times\" concludes that Warren \"ultimately over-indulges in horror clichés and garish set pieces\". By contrast, Martin Unsworth of \"Starburst\" magazine names it \"one of the big underrated movies of the '70s\" and a \"vital entry to the British horror pantheon\". Gary Raymond and Gray Taylor, writing for \"Wales Arts Review\", rank \"Satan's Slave\" 21st in their list of the \"50 greatest\" lesser-known horror films.\n\nJo Botting of the British Film Institute website Screenonline opines that while the plot is \"slightly old hat\", the film's closing plot twists make for a \"satisfying\" ending. She argues that \"Satan's Slave\" \"brought a new realism to horror, with its settings in high-rise urban blocks and with suburban ordinariness hiding Satanic rituals.\" Dennis Schwartz of the Online Film Critics Society rates \"Satan's Slave\" \"C+\", remarking that the film is \"directed with high production values but with little else that rocks\". He considers the film overall to be \"clichéd\", the script \"weak\", the dialogue \"abominable\" and the final plot twist unsurprising as it was \"given away in the opening act\".\n\nReviewing the film for the website DVD Talk in 2004, Bill Gibron described Gough's character as a \"grey Sunday drag of a villain\" and \"Satan's Slave\" in general as a \"near-immobile mess\", adding: \"With an ending that repeats, laps and then doubles back on itself, and an overall atmosphere of dismal dissatisfaction, the only suggestive thing about this movie is its titillating title.\" In another review published in 2012, he gave the film three out of five stars, judging the script \"silly\" and the atmosphere \"often wasted\" but praising the performances of Gough and Candace Glendenning. He commented: \"... if you can get past the endless conversations, [the] lack of real suspense, the flawed feeling of familiarity and the dearth of any or all plot twists toward the end ... then – by all means – saddle up and strap in\". Ian Jane, also of DVD Talk, suggests that \"Satan's Slave\" is \"plagued by some rather obvious pacing problems\" and is less atmospheric and suspenseful than Hammer horror; however, he believes that the film \"has its moments\".\n\nAllMovie considers the film a \"standard effort\". Awarding two stars out of five, Fred Beldin comments that \"Satan's Slave\" \"delivers extra gore and skin to keep the attention from wandering off a well-trodden road ... There's no mystery for the viewer, because director Warren isn't shy about introducing the male lead with a scene in which he rapes and murders a flirty blonde.\" He argues that the film is \"more watchable\" than Warren's later horror films, concluding that \"Satan's Slave\" provides a \"generous allowance of uncomfortable moments for those seeking sick thrills\".\n\nOctavio Ramos of axs.com criticises the film's \"wooden\" acting and argues that the story and characterisation \"lack dynamic punch\". Ramos also believes the film to be misogynistic, \"given that the bulk of the more graphic attacks are aimed at women.\" On the other hand, he commends the script's ideas as well as the presentation of certain scenes, such as the build-up to John's suicide.\n\nIn a separate review of the film's soundtrack, Unsworth gives a rating of nine out of ten, describing John Scott's score as \"a stunning piece of work, melding some erratic styles perfectly and creating a genuine atmosphere of dread with each listen\".\n\n\"Satan's Slave\" has been released on home video by Sovereign Marketing, Anchor Bay Entertainment and Scorpion Releasing. It is included on Anchor Bay's \"Norman Warren Collection\" DVD box set along with \"Prey\", \"Terror\" and \"Inseminoid\". \n\n"}

In that year, there were 91,000 visitors. The primary task of STPB was to coordinate the efforts of hotels, airlines and travel agents to develop the fledgling tourism industry of the country.\n\nLater, STPB began to initiate new marketing ideas to promote Singapore's image abroad. The board created the Merlion, a symbol based on a Singapore mythical legend, that became an icon of the Singapore destination. The board has also been providing travel agent licensing and tourist guide training.\n\nSTPB actively promoted the development of infrastructure, including the building of hotels and tourist attractions such as the Jurong Bird Park and Sentosa which is now a popular resort island for both tourists and local visitors. The board also markets the city as a convention venue and organises events to attract visitors.\n\nIn the 1980s, several historic and culturally significant areas such as Chinatown, Little India and Kampong Glam were earmarked for preservation. These places express Singapore's cultural diversity and became popular tourist destinations. The Singapore River underwent a major cleanup program and the areas along the river were developed for restaurants and other tourist amenities.\n\nThe board was renamed as Singapore Tourism Board in 1997.\n\nPast Chairmen\n\nPast CEOs\n\nThe board now oversees all aspects of tourism, including resource allocation and long-term strategic planning. It establishes offices around the globe to actively market the Singapore destination.\n\nIn the short term, the Singapore government has allocated S$905 million to STB for tourism developments until 2017. A third of this amount will be used to assist the industry to build manpower competencies through education and skills-upgrading initiatives, particularly in key areas such as conference management.\n\nSingapore tourism industry has grown rapidly since STPB was set up. In 2004, there were 8 million visitors. On 11 January 2005, Minister for Trade and Industry unveiled the Singapore Tourism Board’s (STB) bold targets to doubling visitor arrivals to 17 million by 2015, see details here Tourism 2015.\n\nIn March 2010, the STB projected a 20-30% increase in visitor arrivals for the year. 2010 would see the much awaited opening of both the Marina Bay Sands and Resorts World Sentosa. This coincided with other key events such as the FORMULA 1 SINGTEL SINGAPORE GRAND PRIX and the inaugural Youth Olympic Games. These offerings were expected to enhance Singapore’s status as a dynamic global city and increase visitor arrivals. The changes in Singapore's landscape would also continue beyond 2010. New developments such as the International Cruise Terminal, Gardens by the Bay and Changi Motor Sports Hub are expected to be unveiled in the coming years.\n\nOn 24 August 2017, STB and Economic Development Board (EDB) unveiled a unified brand, Singapore – Passion Made Possible, to market Singapore internationally for tourism and business purposes. The new brand aims to provide the opportunity and platform for Singaporeans and residents to showcase their enterprising and persevering spirit to the world, and serve as a unifying brand for Singapore on the international front. The brand will be adopted by other statutory boards and agencies under the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) and incorporated into their marketing campaigns and tradeshows when reaching out to international audiences.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "21252404", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21252404", "title": "Tembetá", "text": "Tembetá\n\nA tembetá (Guaraní language: \"tembé\": lip, \"Ita\": stone.) or barbote (Argentina) is a metal or stone rod placed in lower lip piercings by members of some indigenous peoples in South America. It has been used since the Neolithic period by different human groups for body modification, spiritual protection, and indication of sexual maturity.\n\nAccording to the first studies of Jorge Fernández, tembetás originated in Planalto, Brazil. Their use expanded as far south as El Quisco, Chile, and they were adopted by indigenous groups such as the Guarani, Tupi, and Chiriguano peoples.\n\nThe tembetá played a part in initiation ceremonies, signifying the entry of young men into adult life. After these ceremonies, the men could marry and acquire the responsibilities of an adult male.\n\nThe tembetá is a male adornment in the lower lip. Several men and candidates would meet and drink chicha, a fermented beverage made from maize, to dull the pain. A specialist would perforate the lip with a thick wooden needle. The tembetá would be inserted, and the person would wear it for the remainder of his life.\n\nParticipants would ask during the ceremony that the tembetá protect its owner from death. To this end, it was placed near the mouth, a potential entry of damaging forces. Indeed, it was a very important amulet, more than an adornment.\n\nMolle culture used the adornment, made of rock, preferably of beautiful colors. It consists of a thin curved plate molded to the gums. In the centre was a button, either cylindrical or sharply-pointed, that penetrated the lip 5 to 7 cm.\n\nThe tembetá is a cultural feature of very wide distribution. It has been used by peoples of Africa, Asia, and the Americas and often it had, apart from it decorative value, a social meaning. Another variant was a pipe of stone, often talc, in the shape of letter \"T\". These pipe-shaped tembetás could be used in rites to smoke herbs with hallucinogenic properties.\n\nThe tembetá, called \"labrete\", was used by the tribes of the Guarani. According to archaeological findings, the Guarani tembetá was made of quartz in the shape of a \"T\", 10 cm in length. The working of the quartz was done by a shaman. Quartz correlates to \"ita-verá\" (brilliant stone) of the mythical one \"Tupá Overasú\", and of the great one \"Tupá of the Storm\".\n\nThe tembetá was used in several pre-Columbian cultures in Chile. The principal one was the Molle culture, which brought the tembetá from the Planalto of Brazil. Cultures derived from the Molle were the Diaguita, Llolleo, and Bato.\n\nIn the Llolleo culture the tembetá was of cardinal importance, but among the Bato, it was more on the level of a personal adornment, without any spiritual connotations.\n\nThe tembetá offers protection against the negative action of the \"owners of the nature\"; it is the ritual adornment of the \"souls that travel towards the land of beyond\". Many neolithic tribes of the Amazon demonstrated a deep scorn for peoples that did not use the tembetá.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5123174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5123174", "title": "The Juniper Tree (fairy tale)", "text": "The Juniper Tree (fairy tale)\n\n\"The Juniper Tree\" is a German fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm. In some English language editions the story is called The Almond Tree. The text in the Grimm collection is in Low German and was originally written down by the painter Philipp Otto Runge.\n\nIt was believed until the early 1870s that the Brothers Grimm re-adapted various oral recountings and fables heard from local peasants and townspeople in order to write their well-known fairy tales. However, various critics including Vanessa Joosen argue that this assumption is false, based on an overwhelming amount of disputing evidence. Literary critic Walter Scherf, argued that the Grimm brothers were inspired by the painter Philipp Otto Runge's original adaptation of \"The Juniper Tree,\" originally written as \"The Almond Tree\". The Grimms themselves wrote in the appendix to the 1812 first edition of the KHM that the text was supplied by Philipp Otto Runge.\n\nThe story contains themes of child abuse, murder, cannibalism and biblical symbolism and is one of the Brothers Grimm's darker and more mature fairy tales.\n\n\"The Juniper Tree\" is tale number 47 and Aarne–Thompson type 720: \"my mother slew me, my father ate me\". Another such tale is the English \"The Rose-Tree\", although it reverses the sexes from \"The Juniper Tree\"; \"The Juniper Tree\" follows the more common pattern of having the dead child be the boy.\n\nA wealthy and pious couple pray every day for God to grant them a child. One winter, under the juniper tree in the courtyard, the wife peeled an apple. She cuts her finger and drops of blood fall onto the snow. This leads her to wish for a child to be as white as snow and as red as blood. Six months later, the wife becomes gravely ill from eating juniper berries and asks her husband to bury her beneath the juniper tree if she dies. A month later, she gives birth to a baby boy as white as snow and as red as blood. She dies of happiness. Keeping his promise, the husband buries her beneath the juniper tree. He eventually remarries a woman, with whom he has a daughter named Marlinchen (in some versions Marlene, Marjory or Ann Marie).\n\nThe new wife loves Marlinchen but despises her stepson. She abuses him every day, claiming that she wishes Marlinchen to inherit her stepfather’s wealth instead of her stepson. One afternoon after school, the stepmother plans to lure her stepson into an empty room containing a chest of apples. Marlinchen sees the chest and asks for an apple, which the stepmother gracefully offers. However, when the boy enters the room and reaches down the chest for an apple, the stepmother slams the lid onto his neck, decapitating him. The stepmother bounds his head with the rest of his body with a bandage and props his body onto a chair ouitside, with an apple on his lap. Marlinchen, unaware of the situation, asks her stepbrother for an apple. Hearing no response, she is forced by her mother to box him in the ear, causing his head to roll onto the ground. Marlinchen profusely cries throughout the day whilst the stepmother dismembers the stepson’s body and cooks him into a \"blood-soup\" (Black Puddings Sauer/Suur) for dinner. She later deceives her husband by telling him that his son stayed at mothers great uncle’s house. The husband unwittingly eats the \"blood-soup\" (Black puddings/Sauer/Suur) during dinner and proclaims it to be delicious. Marlinchen gathers the bones from the dinner and buries them beneath the juniper tree with a handkerchief.\n\nSuddenly, a mist emerges from the juniper tree and a beautiful bird flies out. The bird visits the local townspeople and sings about its brutal murder in the hands of its stepmother. Captivated by its lullaby, a goldsmith, a shoemaker and a miller offer the bird a gold chain, a pair of red shoes and a millstone in return for the bird singing its song again. The bird returns home and gives the husband a gold chain whilst giving Marlinchen a pair of red shoes. Meanwhile, the stepmother complains about the “raging fires within her arteries”, revealed to be the real cause of her anger and hatred towards her stepson. She goes outside for relief but the bird drops the millstone onto her head, killing her instantly. Surrounded by smoke and flames, the son, revealed to be the bird, emerges and reunites with his family. They celebrate and head inside for lunch, and live happily ever after.\n\nNone of the characters in \"The Juniper Tree\" have names except for Marlinchen. Instead, they are referred to by their relationship to one another or by their occupation. They are listed below in order of importance.\n\nArguably the protagonist of the story, he is the child of the father and the father's first wife who is also Marlinchen's stepbrother (or in other versions, her half-brother). He was often afraid to return home from school since he would routinely be cruelly abused and beaten by his stepmother, making him cry to sleep every night. Eventually, he is decapitated by his stepmother and his flesh is dismembered, his blood drained and his body and blood are cooked into \"Black Puddings/Blood-Soup. The boy eventually reincarnates into a beautiful bird and kills the stepmother in revenge and reverts to his original human self by the end of the story.\n\nPerceived as the antagonist of the story, she is the second wife of the father and the mother of Marlinchen. She is a disturbed and insane individual who is often clouded with evil thoughts and she often blames this on the \"raging fires in her veins\". However, she attempts to rationalize her evil nature by stating that her stepson would inherit his father's wealth instead of Marlinchen. In some versions, it is mentioned that evil spirits often influenced the stepmother in committing evil deeds against her stepson and she is often thought to be possessed by the Devil himself.\n\nIn some versions she is called Marlene, Marjory or Ann Marie. She is the son's stepsister. She is treated kindly by the stepmother in comparison to her stepbrother. She often cares for her stepbrother in spite of the abuse. When she discovers her stepbrother's corpse, Marlinchen initially presumes that he is ignoring her requests of giving her an apple and under the instruction of her stepmother, she boxes him in the ear. She becomes horrified of causing her stepbrother's head to fall off and cries frantically many times throughout the story, especially when the stepmother cooks the stepson into a stew. She eventually buries the bones of her stepbrother beneath the juniper tree. Marlinchen is a static character throughout the story but becomes more emotional and tearful, especially after the murder of her stepbrother.\n\nThe son's father, the stepmother's husband, the husband of the first wife and Marlinchen's stepfather. He is a wealthy and pious man but he is often absent at home, which probably explains why the stepmother could get away with her abuse towards his son. He was also unaware that the blood-soup/black pudding he consumed was actually made from his son's blood and body. The father is a static character in this work.\n\nThree residents of an unnamed town that is located near the house where the main characters reside. They are captivated by the bird's lullaby who sings about a horrific fate similar to the one suffered by the son. As a reward, for the bird singing its song again they offer the bird a gold chain, a pair of red shoes and a millstone respectively in return. Considered minor characters in this work.\n\nThe son's biological mother and the original wife of the father. Like her husband, she is wealthy and pious and often prays in hopes of getting a child. She dies at the beginning of the story after being extremely ecstatic over the sight of her newborn son and is buried beneath the juniper tree.\n\nThere are many themes, such as cannibalism, death, and food, that play an important role in the short story, \"The Juniper Tree.\" These overall themes are listed below.\n\nSome argue that \"The Juniper Tree\" draws cues from the short story \"Hansel and Gretel\". Following the death of the main character, the mother (in an attempt to cover up his death) literally \"chopped him in pieces, put him into the pan and... [cooked him up in blood-soup/black puddings]. The husband then eats the blood-soup/black pudding, saying how “delicious [the] food is,\" and even asks for the wife to \"give [him] some more.” \n\nIt is quite clear by the end of the tale that food is associated with death. At the beginning of the short story, the girl is cutting an apple when she cuts her fingers and \"blood [falls to] the snow.\" An apple later is even referred to as ushering in the Devil when the little boy comes home and the Devil figuratively makes the mother say to him, \"My son, wilt thou have an apple?” You could even look to the son as a source of death when he is turned into stew. Finally, a millstone is used to kill the mother. A millstone is a tool typically used to grind corn.\n\nCritics suggest that the character of the mother in \"The Juniper Tree\" is used to represent a guardian spirit. This theme of guardianship is shown throughout other Grimm fairy tales such as Cinderella, Briar Rose, and Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. In all of these stories, there is some object (normally represented through nature) that watches after the main character. In the case of \"Briar Rose,\" \"the briar hedge is the symbol of nature guarding her rose: the princess who sleeps inside the castle.\" \n\nWhen the son becomes a bird, he requests gifts such as a gold chain from a goldsmith and a pair of shoes for his sister. In addition, he asks for a millstone from a group of millers, which he drops on the wife's head leading to her swift death. Critics argue that while the chain may represent power (to leave the wife), the shoes may also allude to freedom.\n\nSong is a symbolic motif in that it served as a vessel to expose the son's wrongful death. The bird sang this song to different townspeople in order to get gifts that he will later bestow on his sister and father after they heard the bird sing as well. This song fueled the personification of a bird, which naturally does not have the ability to communicate words to humans.\n\nThe song went like this:\n\nLyrics\n\n\"My mother she killed me,\n\nMy father he ate me,\n\nMy sister, little Marlinchen,\n\nGathered together all my bones,\n\nTied them in a silken handkerchief,\n\nLaid them beneath the juniper-tree,\n\nKywitt, kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!\"\n\nChild abuse is a prevalent theme shown through the stepmother constantly abusing her stepson and eventually murdering him. This theme, along with cruel oppression, is a recurring theme in the works of the Brothers Grimm. such as The Frog Prince and Rapunzel. Critic Jack Zipes suggests that the theme of child abuse leads to a more adult centered story. This veers away from the more accepted thought that fairy tales are meant for children.\n\nThe devil makes an appearance in many Grimms' tales, often in “various disguises.” He takes many identities including anything from a “little man,” to an “old goat.” The stepmother's deep disgust and violent tendencies towards the stepson play right into the mindset that she may be an offshoot of the devil himself. The stepmother offering the stepson an apple before brutally killing him and manipulating her daughter's innocence to cover up the murder is also a direct allusion to the biblical temptation of Eve in the Garden of Eden. Near the end, the stepmother experiences \"raging fires\" within her veins, symbolising the weight of her sins and possibly the damnation of her soul. It is even described at one point during the story that the Devil (who is referred as the Evil One in most adaptions) has gone into her mind before her villainous breakdown.\n\nReligion plays a major symbolic role in the story. Devotion to God was often associated with purity and innocence, as shown through the boy's biological parents and presumably, the boy himself and Marlinchen. The boy reincarnating into the bird and killing the stepmother with the millstone out of revenge can also symbolize the Holy Spirit, who is often depicted as a white dove, executing divine judgement upon the wicked. The story also takes place \"well on two thousand years ago\" placing it firmly in Biblical times. In most English language translations, the dish/cooking method that is described in the text is translated as \"stew\" or as in Margaret Hunt's 1884 translation as \"black puddings.\" What is important here is that the body and the blood of the boy are cooked and consumed by the father. What is missing in most English language translations in the word \"stew\" is that the blood of the boy is also cooked and eaten. The symoblism in relation to the Eucharist - eating the body and drinking the blood of Christ - then become unmistakeable.\n\n\"In fairy tales the cycle of human life is intimately related to the cycle of nature.\" \nParticularly seen in the Grimm Brother's \"The Juniper Tree,\" reincarnation plays a major role in the tale. The audience first sees reincarnation when the first wife asks to be buried under the juniper tree. Although the mother never truly comes back to life, her spirit appears to have supernatural influence over the juniper tree, which allows her son to be physically reincarnated, as a bird and as his originally physical form, at the end of the story.\n\nEach Grimm tale follows a predetermined and categorical format. Every tale is based on the idea that each character is born with fault. For example, if a child is “loved by his parents, he is hated by a brother or sister.” Another example could include a child “surrounded by affection.” Using the Grimm theory, the child then must be “pursued by an offense committed prior to his birth, generally by one of his family.” It is this format that pushes a \"coming of character moment\" where the main character (in order to survive) “set[s] out on a road strew with pitfalls, pursued by an evil willpower, as if distance itself could not take him away from the fatality of [his or her] family.\"\n\nContinuous throughout each of the Grimm tales are the reappearance of transformative bodies. Critic Jeana Jorgensen, argues that there is a connection between the physical transformation of characters and their genders. Drawing a connection between beauty ideals consistently being a major factor in female character development to Grimm, while transformations playing a significant role in the development of mostly male characters. She concludes that female characters are usually described with a focus on their physical attributes such as small, petite, wicked, beautiful, and ugly compared to the adjectives used in male transformations that overall relate strictly to age and size. Specifically, in \"The Juniper Tree\", Jorgensen uses Miriam’s depiction of sorrow as a representation of the fact that in several of Grimm’s tales \"suffering is written on women’s bodies in a way that naturalizes their pain and almost leads us to expect women to cry in fairy tales.\" \n\nFor the Grimm Brother's audience \"the fantasy and magic of the story can be interpreted as instruments to establish or restore social and economic justice.\" Roberta Markman believes that this is the case among all of the Grimm fairy tales because the creative process' \"transformative power[s]\" can change social norms. As a result, literature and other creative art forms have the power to change someone's personal attitude regarding their economic and social situations. This is especially prevalent in Grimm fairy tales where normally the character's social and economic situation is poor at best. For example, in the Grimm's Cinderella, Cinderella's social situation is contingent upon her servitude to her stepmother. As an audience member, when one reads this they are reminded of how good their social situation is in comparison.\n\nThere is an apparent parallel between Grimm’s \"The Juniper Tree\" and his previous works, familial drama. Critic Walter Scherf in a study of the introductions of children’s literature, noted that out of 176 texts, 169 of them started with a basic family conflict. Similar to the plot in Juniper Tree, in Grimm’s \"Hansel and Gretel\", the children live with their stepmother who does not like them, and makes a plan to get rid of them. She states that in the morning she and her husband will take the children into the thickest part of the forest and leave them there, with the intention that they won’t be able to find their way back, and end up starving to death. In comparison to the Stepmother in \"The Juniper Tree\" who wanted her daughter to inherit everything from the Father, killing the Son in order to guarantee this possibility.\n\nIt is important to remember that the Juniper tree is not only the title of the collection, but also a piece of prose within the book. More importantly, the collection of short stories were not written by the Grimm brothers, but instead collected from “various sources… many of which were the original authors.” In total, there are twenty-seven short stories spanning three hundred and thirty-three pages. The Grimm brothers also used illustrations to add to the overall work. According to Grimm, the \"illustrations [used are] delicate in detail, imaginative in concept, and truly beautiful.\"\n\nAcademic discourse is an important part of understanding any sort of text. The Brothers Grimm's \"Juniper Tree\" is no different. Listed below, in alphabetical order, are some examples of commentary written by academic scholars regarding this fairy tale. This represents their individual opinions regarding \"The Juniper Tree\".\n\nIn Alfred and Elizabeth David's essay, they interpret \"The Juniper Tree\" as \"folk literature for inspiration.\" They believe that the nature and native culture presented in most Grimm fairy tale inspires other artists in their literary endeavors In \"The Juniper Tree,\" this theme of nature is present. The Grimm Brothers use the juniper tree as a life source for the mother and the son. The use of nature as a life source inspired other literary work such as \"Briar Rose\".\n\nMany folklorists interpret evil stepmothers as stemming from actual competition between a woman and her stepchildren for resources. In this tale, the motive is made explicit: the stepmother wants her daughter to inherit everything.\n\nThe millstone in the story would have had biblical connotations for the readers of the Grimms' days, especially as the verse Luke 17:2 says that anyone who causes a child to sin would be better off being thrown into the sea with a millstone about his neck; both refer to a millstone as a punishment for those who harm the young and innocent. Another biblical connotation could be the offering of the apple from the stepmother, possessed by the devil, to the son, which parallels the devil, disguised as a serpent, offering the forbidden fruit (traditionally an apple) to Eve.\n\nIn his essay \"On Fairy-Stories\", J. R. R. Tolkien cited \"The Juniper Tree\" as an example of the evils of censorship for children; many versions in his day omitted the stew, and Tolkien thought children should not be spared it, unless they were spared the whole fairy tale.\n\nThroughout the centuries, the Grimm Brothers fairy tales have been retold and adapted by an abundance of sources. The story was adapted:\n\n\n\n"}

Yanagihara stated that her novel was in part inspired by Daniel Carleton Gajdusek who was revered in the scientific community before being accused of child molestation.\n\nYanagihara based the physical look and shape of Ivu'ivu on Angra dos Reis.\n\nIn the late 1990s Dr. Ronald Kubodera, a colleague of Nobel Laureate Dr. Abraham Norton Perina, mourns Norton's downfall after being convicted of sexually abusing his own children. Kubodera encourages Norton to write his memoirs from his prison isolation and marks them with footnotes.\n\nNorton writes of his childhood in the small town of Lindon, Indiana, where his interest in science was piqued by his paternal aunt Sybil, a doctor. While attending medical school Norton attracts the attention of Gregory Smythe, and is hired to work in his lab. Norton is eventually invited to Smythe's home for dinner where Smythe cries in front of him. Repulsed by Smythe, Norton quits the lab. Shortly before graduation however Norton is approached to be the medical doctor on an anthropological mission to U'ivu led by a man named Paul Tallent. Norton realizes that Smythe recommended him in order to send him as far away as possible from him. Despite the fact that the mission is considered career suicide, Norton accepts.\n\nNorton meets Tallent for the first time before they leave from Hawaii to U'ivu and finds him beautiful and enigmatic. When they arrive in U'ivu they meet the other member of the team, a woman named Esme Duff whom Norton immediately dislikes. Tallent leads Norton and Esme to a smaller island that is part of U'ivu called Ivu'ivu. There they meet three hunter guides who lead them deep into the jungle of the island where eventually Tallent reveals to Norton that there is a legend among the U'ivu people about a lost tribe that has been gifted with eternal life but also deep stupidity and that their guides have actually seen one of these people. Shortly after they discover a woman who is devoid of language, completely nude and seems unable to function as a regular human being. The explorers dub the woman Eve and quickly discover a tribe of other people like her whom they dub \"Dreamers\" all of whom have varyingly poor grasp of language. Through some of the more lucid dreamers Tallent discovers that though they all have a mark of a turtle on them, which indicates they are 60, they are actually all well over 100 years old.\n\nShortly after discovering the Dreamers the explorers also discover a group of Ivu'ivu's who had lost contact with the U'ivuians. They are allowed to observe the village as long as they do not bring the Dreamers in contact with them. While there Norton observes the villagers engaging in the ritualistic rape of a young ten-year-old boy. While Esme finds the ritual disturbing Norton decides that it is not rape or abuse but simply a cultural difference. Later on he has a sexual encounter with the boy who was raped.\n\nHe and the group also observe the chief of the village engaging in a ritual to celebrate his 60th year where he eats a turtle. Norton quickly realizes that there is a link between eating the turtle and the seeming immortality and brain damage exhibited by the dreamers. After interviewing one of the dreamers he is taken to a small pond where the turtles comes from and later, against Tallent's advice, returns and kills one of the turtles to bring back its flesh for experiments in America. He and Tallent also bring back four of the Dreamers for further observation.\n\nBack in America, working at Stanford, Norton feeds the turtle to mice and realizes that their life cycle can be extended 6 times that of regular mice. He publishes his paper at first to derision and eventually to acclaim. Tallent warns him that his paper has condemned the people of U'ivu and this eventually proves true; the turtles of Ivu'ivu are eventually hunted to extinction by pharmaceutical companies and the island itself destroyed, eventually U'ivu is colonized as well. Norton continues to visit the island and begins to adopt local abandoned children in great numbers. In 1980 he sees a decrepit man he believes was the boy he had the sexual encounter with when he first came to Ivu'ivu who foists his son on Norton. Norton takes the boy home and names him Victor.\n\nAs Victor grows older he and Norton develop an increasingly contentious relationship. Norton claims that on Christmas Victor locked Norton out of his home leaving him to die after which Norton locked Victor in the basement for a few days. When Victor is a teenager he goes to Norton's brother, Owen, and tells him that Norton raped him, causing a rift between the brothers and leading to Norton's imprisonment.\n\nIn December 2000, Dr. Kubodera writes that he and Norton have escaped from his parole officer. He confesses to feeling guilty for having omitted a portion of Norton's memoirs and includes it as a post-script. The omitted portion reveals that Norton raped not only Victor but many of his other adopted sons.\n\nYanagihara received rave reviews for her novel. \"The New York Times\" called her \" a writer to marvel at\" while \"The Guardian\" called the book an \"ambitious debut\". A review in \"The Independent\" was also overwhelmingly positive calling the novel \"an absorbing, intelligent and uncompromising novel which beguiles and unnerves.\"\n"}

It is Bacigalupi's sixth novel, and is based on his short story, \"The Tamarisk Hunters\"; first published in the environmental journal \"High Country News\". It takes place in the near future, where drought brought on by climate change has devastated the Southwestern United States.\n\nSet at an undetermined point in the near future, the American Southwest has been ravaged by drought, brought on by rising heat and extreme water shortages due to the debilitating effects of climate change. The Colorado River and its tributaries, which are an essential source of water for the region, has decreased to a mere trickle. In Nevada, Arizona, and California, corrupt business magnates control the severely depleted water supply, and routinely battle in armed conflicts for dwindling portions of the river.\n\nAngel Velasquez, a detective, assassin and spy “cuts” water for the Southern Nevada Water Authority, controlled by his boss Catherine Case. Angel's job, as a \"water knife\", is to infiltrate and sabotage the water supplies of competing states, and to make sure that Case can keep her luxuriant arcology developments thriving in Las Vegas. Case wants to ensure that the rich stay wet, while the poor get nothing but dust. \n\nWhen reports of a game-changing water source arise in Phoenix, Angel is sent south to investigate in his customized Tesla. Upon arrving in the blistering heat of Arizona, he encounters Lucy Monroe, an award winning journalist harboring her own agenda and secrets, and Maria Villarosa, a young refugee from Texas, surviving on her instincts and shrewdness. The three find themselves being manipulated in a corrupt game, larger and dirtier than any of them could have ever imagined.\n\nAngel soon discovers that California is trying to monopolize the tiny current of the river, and with Phoenix on the verge of collapsing into chaos and violence, the bodies begin to stack up. As time starts to run out for the three, they discover their only hope for survival rests in one another hands. But when water is such a precious commodity in the desert region, and where partnerships can change in the blink of an eye, the only thing for certain is that someone will have to bleed if anyone hopes to drink.\n\n\nMajor themes include: water shortage and drought, climate change, corporate greed, social hierarchy, refugee crises and fabricated arcologies.\n\nHugo Award winner Jason Heller said \"Bacigalupi plays on a grand scale, but he does so with a keen eye for detail, from the designer dust masks worn by the rich to the construction printers used on an industrial scale (like giant 3-D printers), for the building of Southern Nevada Water Authority super resorts. His big triumph, though, is never forgetting that \"The Water Knife\" is a thriller at its pounding heart. Even amid reams of deeply researched information about the economy, geology, history and politics of water rights and usage in the United States, he keeps the plot taut and the dialogue slashing\".\n\nIn his review for \"The Washington Post\", Héctor Tobar writes that \"Bacigalupi is a grim, efficient and polished narrator\" and creates a \"twisted fictional landscape\" that is a \"vision of the near-future that borrows heavily from the strangeness and conflicts of the present\". Tobar also states that some of the inventions used in the novel reek of stereotypes: \"Mexico, for example, has devolved into a series of political entities called the Cartel States...but a powerful journalist named Lucy Monroe and a refugee from Texas named María Villarosa provide feminine wiles and a much-needed antidote to the book’s relentless bursts of testosterone-driven prose\". Overall, Tobar suggests that fans of Bacigalupi's previous novel, \"The Windup Girl\", will surely \"enjoy losing themselves in these nearly 400 pages of climate sci-fi, or cli-fi, as it’s now called\".\n\n\"The Denver Post\" called the novel a \"blockbuster\" writing that the characters in the book are \"dragged together by fate, make bargains with each other and with themselves, and sometimes manage to rise to the level of anti-hero...there’s a little more techno-jargon, there are explosions and helicopters, breathless action and genuine suspense...this is a rich and, yes, gritty world from a smart author who knows the American Southwest well and knows readers better\".\n\nDenise Hamilton postulated that the book brought to mind the movie Chinatown, saying that while \"one is set in the past and the other in a dystopian future, both are neo-noir tales with jaded antiheroes and ruthless kingpins who wield water as lethal weapons to control life - and mete out death\". Hamilton further opines that \"Bacigalupi's use of water as sacred currency\" evokes the novel \"Dune\" and the \"violence and slang\" may also bring to mind the film, \"A Clockwork Orange\". Still though, Hamilton argues that the book is not a pastiche either; \"Bacigalupi weaves an engrossing tale all his own, crackling with edgy style...and he makes water politics sexy, laying down the jargon and technical details early, then hurrying back to the action-filled streets...the ultimate villains here aren't the hired assassins or lowly water engineers but the faceless corporate owners who play God, deciding if entire regions live or die\". \n\n"}

{"id": "4978374", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4978374", "title": "Valediction", "text": "Valediction\n\nA valediction (derivation from Latin \"vale dicere\", \"to say farewell\"), or complimentary close in American English, is an expression used to say farewell, especially a word or phrase used to end a letter or message, or the act of saying parting words whether brief or extensive.\n\nIts greeting counterpart is called a salutation.\n\nThe term is also used to refer to the speech given by a valedictorian at a commencement and to refer to final prayers and remarks at the graveside before a burial.\n\nValedictions normally immediately precede the signature in written correspondence. The word or words used express respect, esteem, or regard for the person to whom the correspondence is directed, and the exact form used depends on a number of factors. \n\nIn British English, valedictions have largely been replaced by the use of \"Yours sincerely\" or \"Yours faithfully\". \"Yours sincerely\" is typically employed in English when the recipient is addressed by name (e.g. \"Dear John\") and is known to the sender to some degree, whereas \"Yours faithfully\" is used when the recipient is not addressed by name (i.e. the recipient is addressed by a phrase such as \"Dear Sir/Madam\") or when the recipient is not known personally by the sender.\n\nThe following table contains complimentary closings as recommended for business hard-letter use by two American authorities: Barron's Educational Series and American Management Association.\n\nA diplomatic \"note verbale\" always ends with an elaborate valediction, most commonly \"[Sender] avails itself of this opportunity to renew to [recipient] the assurances of its highest consideration\".\n\nValedictions in formal e-mail are similar to valedictions in letters; on the whole, they are variations of \"regards\" and \"yours\". However, a wide range of popular valedictions are used in casual e-mail but very rarely in letters.\n\n\nCurrent regulations of the United States Department of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Army, and the U.S. Navy call for two complimentary closings for letters: \"Respectfully yours\" and \"Sincerely\". \"Respectfully yours\" is reserved for the President, except the Army includes the President's spouse, and for the President-elect. \"Sincerely\" is used in all other cases.\n\nFor more informal (but still professional) correspondence among military service members, \"Very respectfully\" is used. This is often abbreviated as \"V/R.\"\n\nThe Commander of the Navy's school in the military's \"Mustang University\" stated his preference, in 2014, that the older \"Very respectfully\" be used in letters to someone senior in pay-grade or positional authority. However, the Commander acknowledged that current regulations call for \"Sincerely\" and told students they were free to follow that practice.\n\nin written form, valediction is very important in Bengali. When writing official letters, general customs are:\n\nIn oral form, various forms are used\n\nValedictions in Chinese are highly variable and reflect the relative social status of the sender and recipient. Salutation (問候語) is traditionally placed after valediction (申悃語) \"and\" the closing of the main body of the letter, as opposed to its typical location in English. Traditional valediction include:\n\nStandard French language valedictions tend to be much more complex than standard English ones, more akin to older English valedictions. They show a fair degree of variation, for example:\n\nOr:\n\nOr:\n\nIn the latter case of a formula beginning with the first person, the valediction is often enhanced with a participial phrase concluding the sense of the letter (since traditionally it is not considered appropriate to begin a paragraph with the first person singular \"je\" in a letter):\n\nA number of rules concern the use of these formulae:\n\nSuch formulae may be used even in more friendly letters, often with the adjective \"cher\" or \"chère\" for the recipient. Letters to dignitaries may use even more grandiose styles, such as:\n\nor more commonly:\n\nAccording to French typographic rules, the proper capitalization for the official title is \"Premier ministre\" although people who mimic English titles or fear that they might appear disrespectful often use more capitals than the rules commend.\n\nAnother French typographic rule states that when addressing someone, styles like \"Monsieur\", \"Madame\", \"Mademoiselle\", should never be abbreviated, even if followed by a title (hence, writing \"M. le Premier Ministre\" or \"Mme l'Ambassadeur\" would be considered clumsy).\n\nMuch shorter styles may be used in brief notes (\"Sincères salutations\"), and informal letters (such as between intimates) may use expressions such as (with approximate English equivalents – not literal translations):\n\n\nUnlike in English, when the letter writer has a title that is unique in his or her organization, it is placed before, not after, the name:\n\nValedictions in German, while a lot less complex than those in French, are similarly flexible. The highly formal form \"Hochachtungsvoll\" (lit. \"highly respectfully\") has been practically obsolete for many years and is very rarely used in modern German, except for highly formal correspondence from authorities or in letters with a highly negative connotation where \"friendliness\" would not be appropriate.\n\nThe standard business valediction is \"Mit freundlichen Grüßen\" (lit. \"with friendly regards\") and is equivalent to \"Yours sincerely\" or \"Yours faithfully\" in English. A more seldom used variant of this is \"Mit freundlichem Gruß\", which is as above but in the singular form. Other semi-formal alternatives include (roughly in descending order of formality) \"Mit besten Grüßen\" (lit. \"with best regards\"), \"Beste Grüße\", \"Mit herzlichen Grüßen\" (lit. \"with cordial regards\"), \"Viele Grüße\" (lit. \"many regards\"), \"Schöne Grüße\" (lit. \"nice regards\").\n\nGerman valedictions also offer the possibility of adding your location, e.g. \"Mit freundlichen Grüßen aus Berlin\" to added effect. While this is no less formal, it does have a more \"relaxed\" feel to it. Other less formal location-centric variations are also possible, such as \"Viele Grüße aus dem sonnigen Barcelona\" (lit. \"many regards from sunny Barcelona\").\n\nThese valedictions are also often adapted to specific professions, states or political views. For example, it is common to use \"Mit solidarischen Grüßen\" (\"with regards in solidarity\") among socialist and communist groups, \"Mit gewerkschaftlichen Grüßen\" (lit. \"with union regards\") or \"Mit kollegialen Grüßen\" (lit. \"with cooperative regards\") among labour union members, \"Mit kameradschaftlichen Grüßen\" (lit. \"with comradely regards\") among military personnel, \"Mit sportlichen Grüßen\" (\"with sporting regards\") among sportspeople, and \"Mit gebärdenfreundlichen Grüßen\" (\"with friendly regards in sign language\") among persons hard of hearing.\n\nMore familiar valedictions in German follow the same formula. \"Alles Liebe\" or \"(Viele) liebe Grüße\" are common in German for friends or family. Friends or close colleagues among each other may use simply \"Gruß\".\n\nIt is possible in informal and rapid e-mail communication to sometimes use abbreviations of the forms, unlike in English. In this way, \"Mit freundlichen Grüßen\" may be shortened to \"MfG\" and \"Liebe Grüße\" may be shortened to \"LG\". A popular form in Germany in recent years, \"hdl\" (\"habe dich lieb\", lit. \"am fond of you\") and \"hdgdl\" (\"habe dich ganz doll lieb\", lit. \"am very fond of you\", for somewhere between \"I like you\" and \"I love you\") has found increased usage in SMS text messaging and e-mails in more intimate relationships.\n\nJudges have deemed that Section 86a of the German Criminal Code forbids the use of \"Mit deutschem Gruß\" (lit. \"with German regards\"), as it has National Socialist overtones.\n\nFormal letters in Hebrew often end with \"b'chavod (rav*)\" (Hebrew: בכבוד *רב, lit: with (great*) honor) or somewhat less formal \"bivracha\" (Hebrew: בברכה, lit: with blessing). The informal ones may use \"kol toov\" (Hebrew: כל טוב, lit: all the best). For an intimate, you might end a letter or email with \"mitga'ageah\" (m) or \"mitga'aga'at\" (f) -- missing you. Jews in the United States often use \"B'shalom\" or \"shalom\" (Hebrew: בשלום, lit: in peace) within Jewish circles, for example, from a Rabbi to his congregation. This is an American Jewish usage, rarely heard from native speakers of Hebrew. \"B'shalom\" is incorrect, as it is religiously tantamount to wishing death on someone. Indeed, the Talmud says: \"In bidding farewell to the living one should not say, 'Go with peace' [lech b'shalom], but 'Go to peace' [lech l'shalom], because [King] David said to [his son] Absalom, 'Go with peace', and he went and was hanged; whereas Jethro said to Moses, 'Go to peace', and he went and succeeded.\" [Talmud, Moed Katan 29a]\n\nHungarian valedictions are extendable, which makes a number of variations on the above expressions possible, such as \"Őszinte tisztelettel\" (\"With sincere appreciation\") or \"Szívélyes üdvözlettel\" (\"With cordial regards\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormal valedictions should end with a comma followed by a paragraph where the valedictor's name (and optionally his status) is identified. Depending on the occasion, different degrees of formality are adequate, ranging from highly formal (e.g. solemn occasions) to totally informal (e.g. a conversation among friends). Some formal valedictions can be used at different formality degrees, but almost never in informal situations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
