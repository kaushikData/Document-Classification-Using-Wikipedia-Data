The AAT contains generic terms, such as \"cathedral,\" but no proper names, such as \"Cathedral of Notre Dame.\" The AAT is used by, among others, museums, art libraries, archives, catalogers, and researchers in art and art history. The AAT is a thesaurus in compliance with ISO and NISO standards including ISO 2788, ISO 25964 and ANSI/NISO Z39.19.\n\nThe AAT is a structured vocabulary of around 44,000 concepts, including 131,000 terms, descriptions, bibliographic citations, and other information relating to fine art, architecture, decorative arts, archival materials, and material culture.\n\nThe AAT project began in the late 1970s in response to the gradual automation of records by art libraries, art journal indexing services, and catalogers of museum objects and visual resources. Automation required consistency in cataloging as well as more efficient retrieval of information; a controlled vocabulary was a solution to both these problems. The project was conceived by library directors and architectural experts Toni Petersen, Dora Crouch, and Pat Molholt and was originally headquartered part-time at RPI in Troy, NY, then at Bennington College in Bennington, VT and later moved to Williamstown, Massachusetts, with the J. Paul Getty Trust providing technical advice and funding. In 1983 the Getty Trust took over editorial responsibility. The AAT offices relocated to the Getty's Los Angeles headquarters in order to better coordinate with two other similar Getty projects, the Union List of Artist Names (ULAN) and Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN) soon after its publication.\n\nThe AAT was published in 1990 and 1994 in both print and electronic form. By 1997, the size and frequency of updates made hard-copy publication unfeasible and the decision was made to publish via a searchable online Web interface and in data files available for licensing. The online Web interface is freely-accessible from any computer connected to the Internet. Final editorial control of the AAT is maintained by the Getty Vocabulary Program, part of the Getty Research Institute.\n\nSince 2008, Taiwan e-Learning and Digital Archives Program (TELDAP) collaborated with Getty Research Institute (GRI) in developing the Chinese-language Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT-Taiwan). The initial goal of this project is to provide multilingual search and corresponding images in integrate digital archives systems of Taiwan, and broaden the inclusion of terms related to Asian art, architecture and material culture in AAT.\n\nThe AAT can be used in several ways:\n\nAAT is available as Linked Open Data at vocab.getty.edu since February 2014 and is updated bi-weekly.\n\nThe initial core set of terms was derived from authority lists and the literature of art and architectural history; this core set was reviewed, approved and added to by an advisory team made up scholars from all relevant disciplines, including art and architectural historians, architects, librarians, visual resource curators, archivists, museum personnel, and specialists in thesaurus construction. Its hierarchy was inspired by the Medical Subject Headings. All eras from antiquity to the present are covered, and it is not limited geographically.\n\nAs of January 2007, the AAT contained approximately 131,000 terms. While the thesaurus contains many variations on a term, such as singular and plural forms, spelling variants, various forms of speech, and synonyms, one is always flagged as the preferred term. Terms are updated biweekly and regular users are encouraged to propose new terms.\n\nIn 2015 AAT contains 354,000 terms. They are available in 4 major languages (English, Dutch, Spanish and Chinese), and some terms in various native languages.\n\nThe AAT is a faceted classification system as well as a hierarchical one. There are seven facets:\n\nThe record for each concept includes its place in the hierarchy (with a link to its parent), as well as links to related terms, related concepts, sources and contributors for the data, and notes.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4051674", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4051674", "title": "BRD Trilogy", "text": "BRD Trilogy\n\nThe BRD Trilogy () consists of three films directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder: \"The Marriage of Maria Braun\" (1979), \"Veronika Voss\" (1982), and \"Lola\" (1981). The films are connected in a thematic rather than in a narrative sense. All three deal with different characters (though some actors recur in different roles) and plotlines, but each one focuses on the story of a specific woman in West Germany after World War II. The three letter acronym \"BRD\" stands for \"Bundesrepublik Deutschland\", the official name of West Germany and of the united contemporary Germany.\n\n\"The Marriage of Maria Braun\" (1979) begins in the last days of World War II during the rushed marriage ceremony of Maria Braun, after which her husband is sent to battle the advancing Allies. After Maria later hears that he has been killed, she becomes the mistress of an African-American soldier. When Maria’s husband unexpectedly returns alive, she kills the soldier in a scuffle, but her husband takes the blame. Maria becomes the self-centered assistant and lover of a wealthy industrialist and a model of post-war recovery. \n\n\"Veronika Voss\" (1982) depicts the twilight years of film actress Veronika Voss in stark black-and-white. A sports reporter becomes enthralled by the unbalanced actress and discovers that she is under the power of a villainous doctor who keeps her addicted to opiates in order to steal her wealth. Despite his best attempts, he is unable to save her from a terrible end. The original German title, , translates as \"The longing of Veronika Voss\".\n\n\"Lola\" (1981) is loosely based on Josef von Sternberg’s \"The Blue Angel\" and its source novel \"Professor Unrat\" by Heinrich Mann. It tells the story of an upright new building commissioner named Von Bohm who comes to a small town. He falls in love with Lola, innocent of the fact that she is a famed prostitute and the mistress of Shuckert, an unscrupulous developer. Unable to reconcile his idealistic images of Lola with reality, Von Bohm spirals into the very corruption he had sought to fight.\n\nFassbinder had the idea of making a series of films that focus on West Germany during the \"economic miracle\" of the 1950s. The main characters were all female, representing different people in different circumstances. While the original treatments and stories were developed by Fassbinder himself, the detailed scripts for all three films were written by screenwriter Peter Märthesheimer, who had worked with the director as a commissioning producer and script editor of some of his TV projects, with the help of his then partner Pea Fröhlich.\n\nThe films were shot and released in a slightly different order to their accepted numbering. Maria Braun, released in 1979, is the earliest in terms of both production and the chronology of the plot, beginning in 1945. However it only became part of the trilogy retrospectively, when Fassbinder added the caption \"BRD 3\" to Lola when it was released in 1981. Veronika Voss, released a year later as Fassbinder's penultimate film before his death, included the caption \"BRD 2\" and is set in a slightly earlier period than Lola. Fassbinder did not intend the series to stop at a trilogy but his plans to make further films in the same mould were cut short by his death.\n\nThe trilogy was released in a DVD box set by the Criterion Collection in September 2003.\n\nAside from Fassbinder's original intentions of making films about West Germany after World War II and during the \"economic miracle,\" there are other threads that tie these three distinct films together.\n\nOne common thread is the issue of \"forgetting the past for the sake of moving to a brighter future.\" All the main characters in the three films are trying to overcome their present circumstances, largely created by past experiences. This is a criticism by Fassbinder of West Germany in the 1950s and afterward for \"forgetting\" its Nazi period (i.e. allowing former Nazi officials to function in society, even holding positions of political power) and moving ahead as a country (i.e. regaining international respectability and prestige). The painful past is neither acknowledged nor confronted in the historical amnesia.\n\nA second parallel is the question of who exactly benefited from West Germany's economic progress. Fassbinder's view was clearly that some Germans advanced during the \"economic miracle,\" but others fell. For everyone who has a better life (more wealth, security, and peace), someone else suffers and loses. Veronika Voss is an example of someone who does not benefit in Germany after the war because her acting career was most prominent during the Third Reich. Maria Braun is someone who takes a strong initiative to advance economically for the sake of herself and her husband, but she hurts others in the process and in the end is emotionally distant from her husband and her family. Lola tries to take advantage of economic progress and uses her position for advancement, but others who surround her try to achieve the same end with mixed results.\n\nAn additional commonality is the inclusion of African-American soldiers in all three films. In \"The Marriage of Maria Braun\" there are two, a gentlemanly soldier who becomes Maria's lover and another who drunkenly accosts her on a train. The latter character is played by Günther Kaufmann, who also plays African-American soldiers in the other two films. It is unclear if the soldier is supposed to be the same person in all three films. The soldier can be taken as a representation of the influence of the American occupation on post-war Germany, though the fact that he is African-American could have other implications. \n\nEach of the films employs a very distinctive style (especially in its cinematography) to better reflect the characters. \"The Marriage of Maria Braun\" appears with much of its color drained. \"Veronika Voss\" uses a very rich black and white, similar to film noir or German Expressionist films of the 1920s. \"Lola\" is influenced by Josef von Sternberg's \"The Blue Angel\" and uses very bold colors in a manner similar to Technicolor.\n\n"}

{"id": "45907", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45907", "title": "Beyond This Horizon", "text": "Beyond This Horizon\n\nBeyond This Horizon is a science fiction novel by American writer Robert A. Heinlein. It was originally published as a two-part serial in \"Astounding Science Fiction\" (April, May 1942, under the pseudonym Anson MacDonald) and then as a single volume by Fantasy Press in 1948. It was awarded a Retro Hugo award for best novel in 2018.\n\nThe novel depicts a world where genetic selection for increased health, longevity, and intelligence has become so widespread that the unmodified 'control naturals' are a carefully managed and protected minority. Dueling and the carrying of arms are socially accepted ways of maintaining civility in public; a man can wear distinctive clothing to show his unwillingness to duel, but this results in an inferior social status. The world has become an economic utopia; the \"economic dividend\" is so high that work has become optional. The chief economic problem is in fact using up the economic surplus: many high-quality goods actually cost \"less\" than those of lower quality. Many people use lower-quality goods as status symbols. The government invests heavily in scientific research, but this has the side effect of further increasing productivity a decade or more later, so long-term projects with no expected economic return are favored above anything but medical research, on the theory that longer lifespans will consume more surplus.\n\nThe story's protagonist, Hamilton Felix (surname first), is the archetypal übermensch. Felix is the penultimate step in a \"star line\" designed to breed for the highest-quality human characteristics. However, he lacks eidetic memory, which disqualifies him for what many consider to be humanity's most important occupation: that of an \"encyclopedic synthesist\", one who analyzes the sum total of human knowledge for untapped potential. As such, he finds his life—and the society he lives in—to be enjoyable but meaningless. However, when one of these synthesists seeks him out, inquiring when he plans to continue his line, he finds himself drawn into an adventure which not only gives him purpose but convinces him that his society is worth saving after all.\n\nMajor themes in the novel are reincarnation, the immortality of the soul, and telepathy. Hamilton Felix is the product of generations of genetic engineering. He is almost but not quite the perfect human. In the second half of the book his genetically engineered son is born. The son is the climax of generations of genetic engineering and selective breeding, and is a genetically perfect human. As the son grows he begins to develop almost superhuman mental abilities and a surprising telepathic ability. As the novel draws to a close, it becomes apparent that the son senses that Hamiton Felix's second child, a daughter, is the reincarnation of a wise elderly government official who foresaw her own death and arranged to die shortly before Felix's daughter was born. This official understood that the soul is reincarnated, and in preparation for her own death and reincarnation she was instrumental in the genetic engineering of the son and daughter.\n\nAnthony Boucher and J. Francis McComas characterized \"Beyond This Horizon\" as among \"the finest science fiction novels of the modern crop.\" P. Schuyler Miller reviewed the novel favorably, saying \"in true Heinlein manner the basic theme of the book smashes the screen of action only in the closing pages.\"\n\nIn the Japanese visual novel \"Eden*\", the term 'Felix' is used in the setting to refer to genetically engineered humans with abilities similar to those described in the book, and the connection to Heinlein's work is referred to in dialogue.\n\n"}

Designed by David McIntosh, the structure weighs 25 tonnes and stands at over 18 metres tall, and is one of a number of Big Things in Australia designed to attract the attention of passing motorists. It is part of a larger complex that includes a wooden toy factory, wildlife park and café. Owned by the Wilkinson family since the early 1970s, the complex was sold in 2004 and continues to operate today.\n\nIn 1973, after opening a wooden toy factory in Gumeracha, owner Wal Wilkinson chose to incorporate a large roadside attraction to the site in order to attract passing traffic. The first of these was a large wooden giraffe which stood at approximately five metres in height. This was subsequently replaced by a series of rocking horses: a three metre tall horse giving way to a five-metre model, before the process culminated in the decision to build the Big Rocking Horse. The resulting 18.3 metre tall structure was designed by David McIntosh and John Twopenny, and it was opened in 1981 after eight months of construction and an investment of $100,000.\n\nThe Big Rocking Horse remained under Wilkinson family's ownership for just over 20 years, although problems arose late in this period with an increase in insurance premiums. Although it remained structurally sound, a fall in 1999 and the change in liability insurance premiums resulted in the closure of the site to the public in 2001. Prior to this date visitors had been able to ascend to a lookout tower on the head of the structure.\n\nIn September 2003, Graeme Wilkinson placed the Toy Factory—including the Big Rocking Horse—on the market, at an asking price of approximately $900,000. It was sold in 2004 to Anthony Miller, who had emigrated from South Africa in 1999. Under Miller the structure was restored and reopened to the public, with visitor access to the viewing platforms available from April, 2004. Changes made by Miller, including the reopening of the Big Rocking Horse and the removal of entrance fees to the associated wildlife park, saw an overall increase in visitor numbers to the complex from 65,000 in 2003 to 200,000 in 2006.\n\nIn June 2009 the Big Rocking Horse was purchased by Frans and Lyn Gous, another family of business migrants from South Africa, and remains open to the public.\n\nThe Big Rocking Horse is 18.3 metres in height and 17 metres in length. Made of steel, the structure weighs 25 tonnes, and it is set in 80 tonnes of concrete to prevent rocking. The steel frame was fabricated by Halwell Engineering in Adelaide and transported by road to the site, after which the steel cladding was attached. Stairs incorporated inside the rocking horse lead to three viewing platforms: one at the head, one on the saddle, and a third on the \"rocker bows\" near the base of the structure.\n\nThe Big Rocking Horse is part of a larger complex incorporating the Toy Factory, a cafe and a wildlife park. The factory sells a large range of wooden toys and souvenirs, while the wildlife park (which covers approximately seven acres), features a number of native and introduced species, including emus and kangaroos.\n\n"}

{"id": "4904061", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4904061", "title": "Clean living movement", "text": "Clean living movement\n\nIn the history of the United States, a clean living movement is a period of time when a surge of health-reform crusades, many with moral overtones, erupts into the popular consciousness. This results in individual, or group reformers such as the anti-tobacco or alcohol coalitions of the late twentieth century, to campaign to eliminate the health problem or to \"clean up\" society. The term \"Clean Living Movement\" was coined by Ruth C. Engs, a Professor of Applied Health Sciences at Indiana University in 1990.\n\nCycles of social reforms have been observed in religion, politics, the economy and other areas of human endeavor. Reforms to clean up society in regard to issues related to health also appear to come in cycles. Reform campaigns during Clean Living Movements include temperance (anti-alcohol), social purity (sexuality), diet, physical exercise, eugenics (heredity), public health, and anti-tobacco and drug campaigns. Interest in these issues rise and fall more or less simultaneously and often follow a religious awakening in which both evangelical sentiments and the development of new sects emerge. The movements also coincide with episodes of xenophobia or moral panic in which various minorities are targeted as undesirable influences for medical or moral reasons.\n\nIn the United States of America, and to somewhat of a lesser extent in the United Kingdom and other Western European cultures, these health reform movements tend to come in approximate 80-year cycles, ranging from about 70 to 90 years for individual issues. However, the campaign to eliminate polio would not be considered a clean living movements as it was a single issue crusade.\n\nReformers in these movements first attempt to convince individuals they should not drink, smoke or engage in behaviors or lifestyles harmful to health. When this does not work, public policies to prohibit the behaviors are instituted. After the main thrust of the movement, when reformers have failed to change behaviors even by legislation, a hereditarian, or eugenics movement reaches its prime. Reformers may reason that the root causes must be in the genes. During the cycle's ebb, popular changes or reforms that make sense, such as personal hygiene or sanitation, become institutionalized. On the other hand, a backlash often emerges against unpopular or restrictive reforms, such as prohibition of alcohol.\n\nIn the United States, widespread health agitation and subsequent reforms have, within a decade or so, coincided with the religious awakenings of the Jacksonian (1830-1860), the Progressive (1890-1920), and the Millennial (1970-) reform eras.\n\nDuring the Jacksonian era and out of the second great awakening a crusade against \"Demon rum\" and other spirits ensued in states east of the Mississippi River and north of the Mason–Dixon line. This resulted in statewide prohibition of alcohol in this region beginning in the state of Maine in 1851. However, rampant smuggling across the Ohio River and down from Canada soon ended these state laws as they were unenforceable. Various ethnic, cultural, and religious minorities such as Irish immigrants and Roman Catholics were held up as moral examples during the period, thought to be responsible for both excessive drinking and the spread of diseases such as cholera.\n\nDuring this era a focus on exercise, non-use of tobacco, and the elimination of coffee, tea, sugar, meat and spice from a diet, called \"Grahamism,\" – named after reformer Sylvester Graham – was promoted. Eugenic or \"hereditarian\" concerns that masturbation would lead to insanity and that choosing sick or feeble spouses would lead to further degeneration was discussed. Out of this era Phrenology – the study of shapes and bumps on the head – used to select a healthy marriage partner was popular. New religions that promoted \"pure\" lifestyles such as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Seventh-day Adventists emerged.\n\nThe Progressive era's health reform movement emerged in the third great awakening. Individual health crusades, as part of an overall Clean Living Movement, included the temperance and the anti-saloon movement which evolved into the prohibition movement. This resulted in the Eighteenth Amendment, or prohibition. An anti-tobacco movement was found during this era and a number of cities had anti-smoking laws in public buildings. Trains, restaurants, and streetcars often had smoking and non smoking sections. However, these laws by the mid twentieth-century were generally ignored.\n\nThe first regulation of narcotic drugs were enacted during this period, regulating the contents of patent medicines. The first Pure Food and Drug Act, regulating the labelling of patent medicines and the claims made in their advertising, was passed in 1906. The smoking of opium was prohibited by the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act of 1914 as an exotic vice imported with immigration from China. In addition to these drug prohibitions, further immigration from East Asia was sharply curtailed by the Asian Exclusion Act of 1924. Likewise, the prohibition of cocaine during this period was associated with anecdotes about African Americans committing crimes under the influence of the drug.\n\nA \"purity\" or anti-prostitution and social hygiene (sexually transmitted diseases) movement went hand in hand with the elimination of other supposed evils, such as alcohol, from society. The purity movement also included the elimination of the double standard of sexuality for men and women. The eugenics movement to improve the human race was intertwined with these other movements. Pre-marital testing to ensure that neither partner had syphilis were passed in many states. In the United States, Eugenic sterilization laws were passed to prevent individuals with severe mental or physical health problems including alcoholism from reproducing were instituted in over 30 states\n\nThe Clean Living Movement around the turn of the twenty-first century was characterized by many crusades and counter crusades. Activities that surged in the earlier years of the era were often met with counter-movements about ten years later. For example, \"women’s liberation\" was countered by a \"pro-family\" movement; the use of marijuana and other drugs was followed by a \"war on drugs\"; lowering of the drinking age was followed by a raising of the drinking age; non-marital sexual activity was challenged by a new \"purity\" movement; and legal rights to obtaining abortions (\"pro-choice\") were met with agitation against abortion (\"pro-life\").\n\nThe baby boom generation of the post World War II era had experimented with different behaviors not tolerated by the older generation. By the mid 1970s more conservative Americans began to react against what they perceived as immoral behaviors. They coalesced into political action that included campaigns against the use of drugs, alcohol, sexual, and other activities. A secular health-reform movement, that to some became a \"religion,\" also surged out of the youthful generation. Fitness and exercise, diet, alternative religions and medicine, consumers rights, smoke-free environments, and other health reforms became prime concerns of the day.\n\n\n"}

Geta is much drier than Earth, with eleven separate bodies of water large enough to be called seas; most of the land area is desert.\n\nThe Njarae Sea, the largest, is a narrow body extending around a quarter of the planet's circumference from northeast to southwest. Much of the story takes place in lands along the east coast of the Njarae.\nTerraforming was never, or very minimally, initiated on the planet's biosphere, leaving it very inhospitable to the descendants of the original settlers, who have become mythic, God-like creatures to its denizens.\n\nApparently the only Earth-life on Geta are humans, bees, and the \"Eight Sacred Plants\", including wheat, soybeans, barley, and potatoes.\nNative, \"profane\" life includes plants, a wide variety of sea-creatures and \"insects\", but no large land-animals. \nEach has a different biochemistry, so each is largely toxic to the other.\nParts of certain profane species can be eaten if prepared correctly.\nAs a result, food is a commodity that is very precious on Geta, and in most places the only source of meat is humans themselves. Cannibalism has insinuated itself into the very fabric of social and religious life.\nOn the other hand, humans are not at risk of infection from native bacteria, and seem not to have brought any pathogens with them.\n\nThe planet seems to have been settled centuries before the time of the story by a small group, possibly not by choice. \nApparently, they made little use of printed materials that could be read in a world without advanced technology. Most knowledge of history and the larger universe was therefore lost, the remainder preserved by oral tradition in \"Chants\" and stories.\nThe settlers' ship remains in orbit, but its nature has been forgotten; it is generally referred to as \"God\". The Horse survives only as a piece in chess, named for a \"mythical sidestepping insect\".\n\n\"Courtship Rite\" is set in a time of rapidly advancing technology. \nThe Getans are past masters of biology and genetics, capable of modifying organisms gene by gene. \nApparently this knowledge was maintained from the time of landing, being necessary for survival.\nThey also make use of steam engines and electricity, but are handicapped by an apparent lack of fossil fuels to smelt metals and provide power. \nThey have sailing ships on the seas, and sailplanes, but no powered aircraft. \nAs a consequence, few Getans travel far from home; a few have become famous by walking all the way around the world.\nAt the beginning of the story, one clan, the Kaiel, has developed radio, and are exploiting the advantage of communicating much faster than their rivals. They also develop bicycles and other pedal-powered vehicles using light, metal-spoked wheels.\nThey have also learned how to extract information from a \"Frozen Voice of God\" — an optical data-storage crystal left over from the original settlers.\n\nSocially and politically, Geta has no nation-states in the way we recognize the term. \nThe \"priest clans\" have precedence, governing territories and the resident members of the underclans.\nIn particular, they have the power of deciding, during times of famine, who must make the ultimate \"Contribution to the Race\":\nAll individuals are rated in various ways on their \"kalothi\", or fitness to survive. When the need arises, those lowest on the list are required to perform \"Ritual Suicide\".\nThe ordinary clans have generally evolved into differing niches based on some attribute or inclination of their founders. \nFor instance, the Ivieth specialize in transportation and haulage duties. \"Before puberty an Ivieth hauled his load or was walked to death and eaten.\"\nThe o'Tghalie have an ability to perform complex mathematical problems.\n\nThe novel details the attempts of two of the priest-clans, the Kaiel and the Mnankrei, to expand into territory controlled by the Stgal.\nUltimately, all the priest clans are trying to attain dominance of the planet through the use of new technology, propaganda, treachery, and \"war\", a new concept in this world. Previously, killing was done merely in order to provide food.\n\nJo Walton remarked that \"Courtship Rite\" \"is about a distant generation of colonists on a planet with no usable animals. This is the book with everything, where everything includes cannibalism, polyamory, evolution and getting tattoos so your skin will make more interesting leather when you’re dead.\"\n\nJohn Clute, although troubled by its didactic libertarianism and Social Darwinism as well as the way Kingsbury \"rigs his Getan society\" to establish his political ideas, concluded that \"the book is a considerable accomplishment, that it's a feast (of the imagination) and great fun while it lasted, within its covers.\n\n"}

It was one of the largest art schools in the city, having several hundred scholars.\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, Boston had become an important art center. A number of highly respected artists were teaching in city. The rich environment for art had been promoted at least in part by the Massachusetts Drawing Act of 1870. The act mandated drawing lessons in public schools. To fill the need for art teachers, Massachusetts Normal Art (MNA) was established in 1873. Two blocks behind the Museum of Fine Arts, in the New Studio Building near the Back Bay Station, was the Cowles Art School (1883).\n\nCowles Art School offered instruction in figure drawing and painting from the flat cast and life, artistic anatomy, perspective and composition, painting still life, drawing and painting the head from life, drawing still life, oil and water colors, ad perspective.\n"}
{"id": "26114702", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26114702", "title": "Croatian national costume", "text": "Croatian national costume\n\nCroatian national costume or Croatian dress (, plural: \"narodne nošnje\") refers to the traditional clothing worn by Croats living in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, with smaller communities in Hungary, Austria, Montenegro, and Romania. Since today Croats wear Western-style clothing on a daily basis, the national costumes are most often worn with connection to special events and celebrations, mostly at ethnic festivals, religious holidays, weddings, and by dancing groups who dance the traditional Croatian kolo, or circle dance.\n\nEach cultural and geographical region has its own specific variety of costume that vary in style, material, color, shape, and form. Much of these regional costumes were influenced by the Austrian, Hungarian, German, Italian, or Turkish presence, due to whichever power ruled the region.\n\nFor the female dress, attire consists of a plain white dress or blouse (\"košulja\") or underskirt (\"skutići\"), which is usually the basic form of the costume. It is then added with other clothing and decorations, which may include another overdress or skirt (\"kotula\"), a decorative jacket (\"djaketa\", \"paletun\" or \"koret\"), apron (\"ogrnjač\" or \"pregjača\"), scarf (\"ubrsac\"), kerchief or shawl which are usually decorated with a floral or animal motif. The embroidery is very intricate and is usually red, white, blue, gold, or black. Her jewellery, ranging from necklaces, earrings, bracelets, and rings could consist of gold, silver, beads, pearls, or even corral from the Adriatic. Hair is interwoven into one or two braids and decorated with red ribbons for girls or women that are unmarried, while married women wear woven or silk kerchiefs on their heads. Costumes of brides consists of a crown or wreath often made of flowers (\"vijenac\") and large amounts of jewelry. The woman's head could be adorned by a kerchief, cap, or a headdress, the most famous being the headdresses worn by the women from the island of Pag. The amount of paraphernalia a woman is adorned with, either very much or rarely any at all, depends on the region. Completing the costume are stockings (\"bječve\") or knee-high socks, and boots or a special kind of sandal called opanci.\n\nFor the males, the national dress usually consists on loose, wide slacks (gače širkoke) and a shirt, and both are usually either black or white, or both. The man may wear a decorative or plain vest (\"fermen\" or \"jačerma\"), over his shirt, and possibly a waistcoat. The man almost always wears a cap, varying in shape and design depending on the region. The most famous cap is perhaps the Lika cap, worn in the Lika region for centuries by the people. Footwear, like the women's', consists mainly on boots and sandals. Because of the weather, certain places often have woolen vests, cloaks, coats, or fur for the colder regions, and silk and light linens for the warmer climates.\n\nThere are four main types of costumes associated with the regions: the Pannonian style in the north and east, the continental or Dinaric style, and the coastal style on the coast.\n\nBoth Slavonia and Baranya are located in the east, and are associated with the Pannonian style of dress and the Šokci. In Slavonia, the costumes tend to be very elaborate, with floral designs and clothing with silk or wool, fancy embroidery, decorative silk ribbons and bows, lace work, gold or silver jewelry, corals, amber necklaces and pearls for the women. The colors of the dresses tend to be bright and numerous, with colors ranging from gold, red, blue, white, and black all in one costume. The top shirt, or \"odnjica\", of the costume has fringed-wing sleeves, which is generally associated with the Pannonian style.\n\nFor the men, they tend to wear not as many colors for the shirt and pants, but often wear thick coats or vests with designs and patterns stitched on and fancy embroidery like the women. Their sleeves might have a slight ruffle at the end, but not as much as the women's' In Baranya, a part of the men's costume is a small apron that is worn over the trousers that ranges in color and design.\n\nPosavina and Podravina are both in the north, north-east part of Croatia. Unlike the Slavonians, the costumes from Posavina do not focus on too much elaborate designs and patterns, and instead consists of simple black and white blouses, trousers, and skirts. The men wear black vests and black hats while the women wear beautiful silk shawls, usually blue or red in color with flower motifs. A thick apron with embroidered designs could be worn as well, and their color and detailed patterns are often the main focus of the costume.\n\nAlthough the clothing may be plain, the shawls and/or aprons worn over the blouses and skirts make up for the plain attire in Podravina, and they are sometimes so colorful and richly garnished with patterns that they completely cover up the main dress. The women in Podravina style their own kerchiefs with a unique embroidery from the region, and they wear aprons over their dresses which are colorful and geometric in design and attached with a multi-colored fringe. The men's vests are usually red or black and color and are garnished with intricate patterns and embroidery as well.\n\nMeđimurje, Zagorje and Zagreb are all located in the north, and are therefore influenced by the continental style. White garments are typical for the continental region, but each has its own decorative scarves, shawls, aprons, and jewellery. Red is the most popular color, especially in Zagorje, and the aprons and vests worn by the men and women are red with elaborate stitching and embroidery, mostly with gold thread. Women wear colorful shawls and kerchiefs which are usually red with flower designs. The second most popular color is black, which could have gold or white embroidery, or none at all.\n\nVery often, the men and women would not wear any aprons or shawls, and their costumes would mostly consist of their white garments, which they may stitch a border of color at the ends, or add a sash (\"tkanica\") for some color.\n\nHats are an important part of a male's costume, and can come in two forms: the traditional Pannonian hat (\"škrlak\") is black and dome-shaped, with a red wool band embroidered with multi-colored thread and white and gold dots attached, or the black felt box-hat (\"šešir\") folded into a flat bow at the back with a grosgrain ribbon tied around the body. Over the grosgrain ribbon, red, white and blue strings are often tied around the hat (e.g. the Croatian tri-color).\n\nThe costumes from Istria are influenced by the Adriatic style of the coast.\n\nThe men's costumes are typically blue or brown or white, and consist of white, ankle length trousers that are tighter than the Slavonian style, shirts, and leather vests. Coats worn over them are generally short and long-sleeved or long, sleeveless ones. Accessories include wide silk belts, red or black caps, and cotton socks worn over their footwear called opanci (strapped soft soled sandals).\n\nWomen on the coast wear broad-sleeved white blouses that are embroidered in silk or lace, as well as pleated skirts or dresses varying in color, and stockings under their \"opanci\". They also cover their shoulders with colorful shawls called \"oplece\", which cover the shoulders and tie around the neck, hanging over their arms and upper-chest. Jewellery is made of colorful glass beads and silver coin discs, which are found hanging around the neck and waist by string of leather.\n\nThe costumes of Lika show testament to both the Dinaric and Ottoman influence of the region. Due to the military history of the region, costumes can vary from civilian to military-wear. Because of the ruralness of the region and the prevalence of sheep, wool is spun and dyed (usually red, black, yellow and green) and fur coats and capes are common because of the cold winter weather.\n\nWomen tend to wear skirts down to their ankles and a white blouse. Their attire is generally in earth-tones, with white, brown, and black being most common, however, blue dresses and aprons are reserved for married women, while white is for the unmarried ones. Unlike the Croats from the north, the special sandals (opanci) are worn daily. However, liberties are taken with the apron, which is often woven with colorful stitching and patterns with geometric motifs. Multi-colored wool socks (\"priglavci\" or \"nazuvci\") with various geometric design are worn over the \"opanci\". For headwear, women wear embroidered kerchiefs or white kerchiefs pinned to their hats. Jewelry such as earrings, bracelets, and necklaces are silver, and necklaces (\"djerdan\") and earrings are often made of silver coins, traditionally from the 19th century Austrian coins (\"talira\").\n\nThe costume of the men varies when taking military uniform in consideration. A simple costume would have trousers and a linen shirt of either white, black or brown color (or blue for military men). The vests can be made of leather, or wool that are either black or red, and can be simple with no designs, or very elaborately designed with intricate patterns. Black or blue coats or capes made of lamb fur are worn during the winter. Red belts or sashes are tied around their waists and used to hold guns or swords, a remnant from the military era. A special carved knife from the Ottoman days (called a \"handžar\" or \"nož\") are mainly used. A special cap exclusive to the region is the Lika cap that is worn by all men, regardless of social position.\n\nDalmatian costume varies from within its own region; while the coastal areas are Adriatic and coastal in influence, the inner area, called Zagora, shows the Dinaric influence similar to the style of Lika and Herzegovina.\n\nPerhaps the most famous example of Zagora costume comes from the small town of Vrlika, rich in dance and tradition still carried on today. Both men and women's dress wear is characterized by multiple subjects of clothing over another. For men, the costume consists of carefully chosen pieces worn over each other: a red sash is tied around dark pants with a fringe of threads hanging from the belt in red, blue, or green colors. Due to centuries of military mentality, a special leather belt is worn to carry weapons. Over the shirt is a decorated tunic, elaborate in design and custom-made fringe. The vest that is worn is vastly decorated with gold and red embroidery and patterns and designs, with different styles or material and cut depending on the seasonal weather. Much like the men, the women's dress consists of clothing worn over more clothing: a white blouse, skirt or tunic is most common, with a colorful apron consisting of complicated geometric patterns and fringe worn over, as well as a red vest with gold stitching made in a way to make it stand out from the white blouse. Jewellery consists mainly of beads worn around the neck and silver coins adorned around the costume. Both men and women wear red felt pillbox caps (\"bareta\" or \"crvenkapa\"), with a white habit attached to the women's'.\n\nFrom the coast, the national costume of Dubrovnik consists mainly of white, black, gold, and red colors. Both men and women wear vests rich with gold embroidery while the women wear the recognizable gold tassels decorating the front blouse and fine jewelry such as earrings, necklaces and hair clips. Men and women usually wear white or black trousers or skirts respectively.\n\nThe islands of Croatia have the most variation in dress due to their geographic distance and isolation from one another. They find more similarity with Dalmatia and Istria, but many have their own unique styles not seen elsewhere.\n\nFor example, the national costume from the island of Pag has its origins in the fifteenth century, and is characterized by the intricate lace that decorates the front part of blouses and the edges of kerchiefs. The famous lace work of Pag is renowned for its precision and beauty, and is the most prominent part of the costume apart from the large white headdresses worn by the women of the island. Women wear long-sleeved blouses and full pleated skirts (usually gold or red in color) with a red silk scarf tied around their waist. The men wear vests over their shirts with form-fitting trousers with a red silk handkerchief worn around the waist and red hats.\n\nCroatian dress from Bosnia and Herzegovina fall under the Dinaric category of dress style, and regional variations between western Herzegovina and central Bosnia is most prominent. In Herzegovina, the style of dress is vastly similar to the inland Dalmatian style.\n\nIn central Bosnia however, the Ottoman influence is more prominently shown. For women, the dress is mainly white heavy cotton with puckered vertical stripes, while the collar is embroidered with a crocheted trim and dotted with sequins. The vest is generally dark in color with a golden trim embroidered along the edges, and the apron is made of wool, dyed usually red, black, or dark green with minimal designs. If no apron is worn, than the dress may consist of special embroidery and crocheted lace, and pantaloons (gače) are worn with white, knee-length stockings (\"čarape\"). The sash (\"tkanica\") worn around the waist is black with green and gold wool handwoven within. The headscarf can be a kerchief (\"krpa\") with various geometric designs and/or floral embroidery, or more elaborate kind (\"čember\") with a crocheted edge with a wide band of multi-colored geometric embroidery on one side and half of opposite side.\n\nFor men, white cotton shirts with wide sleeves and black pants with a fringed leg are the basic elements of the costume. The vest is made of thick wool and is dark in color and can be embroidered or crocheted like the females'. The sash around the waist varies in color from region, but is usually dark. Socks are worn to knee length much like the females, and are usually white, red, or gold in color.\n\nThe Croatian dress from Serbia comes mainly from the Vojvodina region in the north, with the impact of the Pannonian style figuring very strongly. The most common color for both men and women to wear is white, with elaborate embroidery or stitching at the ends or hems or the sleeves, trousers, or skirts. They would wear blue or black aprons and vests over their garments with gold embroidery. But the most notable Croatian costumes come from the Bačka region, where for centuries the women have ordered the silk for their costumes from Lyon, France. They come in a rich blue color that has made them recognizable throughout the region.\n\nThe Croats from Kosovo have a dress that has a more Dinaric style, having adapted many of the Vardarian style of dress into their traditional costumes. They are called Janjevci, derived from the villages the majority are from. Since most are descended from Dubrovnik traders seven centuries back, they have maintained certain elements of Dubrovnik style clothing that is reflected in their national dress. Due to conflicts plaguing Kosovo over the years, many have migrated to Croatia, where a large cultural community has been set up in Zagreb, preserving the songs, dances, and culture of the Janjevci.\n\nCroatian minorities in nearby countries such as Hungary, Romania, Italy, Montenegro and Austria continue to have their own traditional dress influenced both by their ancestor's original costume and adaptation of certain local regional styles.\n\nIn Hungary, the native Croats often participate in cultural festivities wearing their national costumes, which have been heavily influence by Hungarian style with elaborate colors and rich material.\n\nIn Austria, the Croatian Cultural Association helps maintain the culture of the local Croats by sponsoring local kolo, where traditional costumes from Nikitsch show the German and Austrian Alpine influence.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "275477", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=275477", "title": "Culture of Guyana", "text": "Culture of Guyana\n\nGuyanese culture reflects the influence of African, Indian, Amerindian, British, Portuguese, Chinese, and Dutch cultures. Guyana is one of a few mainland territories of South America that is considered to be a part of the Caribbean region. Guyanese culture shares many commonalities with the cultures of islands in the West Indies, \n\nNotable Guyanese authors include Wilson Harris, Jan Carew, Denis Williams, Roy A. K. Heath and E. R. Braithwaite. Braithwaite's memoir \"To Sir, With Love\" details his experiences as a black high-school teacher in the poor East End of London. An early Guyanese-born author was Edgar Mittelholzer, who became more well known while living in Trinidad and England. He is well known for his works, which include \"Corentyne Thunder\" and a three-novel set known as the Kaywana Trilogy, the latter focusing on one family through 350 years of Guyana's history. \n\nOther writers who have made a significant contribution to Guyanese literary culture include Fred D'Aguiar, David Dabydeen, Martin Carter, and Jan Carew.\n\nAlthough the beginning of theatre in 19th-century Georgetown was European, in the early 20th century a new African and Indian Guyanese middle-class theatre emerged. In the 1950s there was an explosion of an ethnically diverse and socially committed theatre. Despite an economic depression, there was a struggle to maintain theatre post-1980. Serious repertory theatre was highlighted by Carifesta and the Theatre Guild of Guyana. Wordsworth McAndrew has been prominent in Guyanese theatre since the 1960s.\n\nGuyanese actors who have been successful internationally include Harry Baird, Norman Beaton, Anthony Chinn, Tommy Eytle, Cy Grant, Ram John Holder, Pauline Melville, Carmen Munroe, Sol Raye, and Ian Valz.\n\nGuyana's musical tradition is a mix of African, Indian, European, and Latin elements. The most popular type of music is Calypso and its offshoots and mixes, like in other parts of the Eastern Caribbean. The various types of popular music include reggae, calypso, chutney, Soca, local Guyanese soca-chutney and Bollywood film songs (or Indian music). Due to globalization, sounds from neighbouring countries can be heard such as Merengue, Bachata, Salsa, with Reggaeton being the most popular. Popular Guyanese performers include Billy (William) Moore, Terry Gajraj, Mark Holder, Eddy Grant, Dave Martins & the Tradewinds, Aubrey Cummings and Nicky Porter. Among the most successful Guyanese record producers are Rohit Jagessar, Eddy Grant, Terry Gajraj and Dave Martin.\n\nVisual art takes many forms in Guyana, but its dominant themes are Amerindian, the ethnic diversity of the population and the natural environment. Modern and contemporary visual artists living in, or originally from, Guyana include Stanley Greaves, Ronald Savory, Philip Moore, Donald Locke, Frank Bowling, Hew Locke, Roshini Kempadoo, Leila Locke, George Simon and Aubrey Williams.\n\nThe story of cinema in Guyana goes back to the 1920s when the Gaiety, probably British Guiana's first cinema, stood by the Brickdam Roman Catholic Presbytery in Georgetown, and showed Charlie Chaplin-type silent movies. After the Gaiety burnt down around 1926, other cinemas followed, such as the Metro on Middle Street in Georgetown, which became the Empire; the London on Camp Street, which became the Plaza; and the Astor on Church and Waterloo Streets, which opened around 1940.\n\nThe Capitol on La Penitence Street in Albouystown had a rough reputation. The Metropole was on Robb and Wellington Streets; the Rialto, which became the Rio, on Vlissengen Road; the Hollywood was in Kitty; and the Strand De Luxe on Wellington Street, was considered the luxury showplace.\n\nCinema seating was distinctly divided. Closest to the screen, with rows of hard wooden benches, was the lowly Pit, where the effort of looking upwards at the screen for several hours gave one a permanent stiff neck. The next section, House, was separated from the Pit by a low partition wall. House usually had individual but connected wooden rows of seats that flipped up or down. Above House was the Box section, with soft, private seats and, behind Box, Balcony, a favourite place for dating couples. These divisions in the cinema roughly represented the different strata existing in colonial society.\n\nGuyanese have produced several feature films over the years. The international award-winner \"Guiana 1838\", a film by Guyanese-born, US-based writer and director Rohit Jagessar that depicts the arrival of indentured Indian servants to the Caribbean in 1838 following the 1834 abolition of slavery in the British Empire, was released in 2004.\n\nGuyana's historic architecture reflects the country's British colonial past. Even current houses when made of wood still emulate aspects of the style. Many of the buildings in Georgetown and New Amsterdam were built entirely of local wood.\n\nThe major sports in Guyana are cricket and football. Guyana plays as part of West Indies team for international cricket. Minor sports include beach cricket, netball, rounders, lawn tennis, basketball, table tennis, boxing, squash, and a few others.\n\nGuyana hosted international cricket matches as part of the 2007 Cricket World Cup. The new 15,000-seat Providence Stadium, also referred to as Guyana National Stadium, was built in time for the World Cup and was ready for the beginning of play on March 28. At the first international game of CWC 2007 at the stadium, Lasith Malinga of the Sri Lankan team performed a \"helmet trick\" or \"double hat-trick\" (four wickets in four consecutive deliveries).\n\nGuyanese cuisine is similar to the rest of the Anglo Caribbean, especially Trinidad, where the ethnic mix is somewhat similar. The food reflects the ethnic makeup of the country and its colonial history, and includes Ethnic groups of African, Creole, East Indian, Portuguese, Amerindian, Chinese and European (mostly British) influences and dishes. The food is diverse and includes dishes such as Dal bhat, curry, roti and cookup rice (the local variation on the Anglo-Caribbean rice and peas. The one pot meal while not the national dish is one of the most cooked dishes. With its various versions, according to what type of meat, beans and other ingredients available, is a true reflection of the country.\n\nDishes have been adapted to Guyanese tastes, often by the addition of herbs and spices. Unique preparations include Guyana Pepperpot, a stew of Amerindian origin made with meat, \"cassareep\" (a bitter extract of the cassava), and seasonings. Other favourites are cassava bread, stews, and metemgee, a thick rich type of soup with ground provision, coconut milk and large dumplings (called Duff), eaten with fried fish or chicken. Homemade bread-making, an art in many villages, is a reflection of the British influence that includes pastries such as cheese rolls, pine tarts (pineapple tarts), and patties.\n\nCurry is widely popular in Guyana and most types of meat can be curried: chicken, seafood, goat, lamb, and even duck. Guyanese-style Chow Mein is another dish cooked regularly in many homes.\n\nCaribbean ground provisions (known colloquially as provisions) are part of the staple diet and include cassava, sweet potato, and eddoes. There is an abundance of fresh fruits, vegetables and seafood on the coast.\n\nMost individuals use fresh fruits to make their own beverages, which are called \"local drink\", which are made from readily available fruits or other parts of plants. Popular homemade drinks are Lime Wash (like lemonade), pine drink (from a pineapple), mauby, made from the bark of a tree; sorrel drink, made from hibiscus; ginger beer (made from ginger root), and peanut punch.\n\nFresh fish and seafood are an integral part of the Guyanese diet especially in the rural areas and small villages along the coast. Popular fish types include gilbaka, butter fish, tilapia, catfish, and hassa (Hoplosternum). The crab soups with okra from the Berbice coastal region resemble the Louisiana Creole soups like gumbo.\n\nChristmas and Old Year's Night (New Year) is the most celebrated time for Guyanese for food and festivities. Advance preparation is part of the exciting pre-preparation for Christmas celebrations. It starts with the preparation and soaking of fruits and rum or wine for Black Cake weeks or sometimes months ahead to intensify the flavour. Local drinks such as ginger beer, mauby and sorrel are fermented and require a sitting (pre-preparation) period prior to making. Ginger beer is the Christmas drink of choice, similar to the popularity of eggnog in North America. Some dishes certain to be served are Guyana pepperpot, garlic pork, black cake, sponge cake and home-made bread. Some of the local drinks and food require advance preparation.\n\nGuyanese style Chinese food and fried chicken are the most popular restaurant and take-out items, and are found in the bigger towns. Popular Chinese dishes include lo mein, chow mein, and \"Chicken in the ruff\" (fried rice with Chinese-style fried chicken).\n\nGuyanese folklore is similar to the Caribbean folklores, mixed with African, Indian, Amerindian, and British/European beliefs.\n\nEnglish is the main language, and Guyana is the only English-speaking country in South America, though many people in neighbouring Suriname also speak English. British English is taught in school and used in Government and business. Guyanese creole, a pidgin of 17th-century English, African and Hindi words, is used at home and on the street. It is the same as creoles spoken in the Eastern Caribbean such Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, and St. Vincent but with different accent or emphasis on how the words are pronounced.\n\nThere are also a small number of trace words from the extinct Dutch Creoles, and French. Depending on the race of the person and location, the accent and sprinkling of other words can also change. An example of this would be an Indo Guyanese who would use a word or two words left over from when they spoke Hindi.\n\nAs time passes, British terms and phrases for things are being replaced by American ones, due to US influence. Where once people would have said \"flats\" as in England, the term \"apartment\" is now being used by some people.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1344501", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1344501", "title": "Culture of the Faroe Islands", "text": "Culture of the Faroe Islands\n\nThe culture of the Faroe Islands has its roots in the Nordic culture. The Faroe Islands were long isolated from the main cultural phases and movements that swept across parts of Europe. This means that they have maintained a great part of their traditional culture. The language spoken is Faroese. It is one of three insular Scandinavian languages descended from the Old Norse language spoken in Scandinavia in the Viking Age, the others being Icelandic and the extinct Norn, which is thought to have been mutually intelligible with Faroese. Until the 15th century, Faroese had a similar orthography to Icelandic and Norwegian, but after the Reformation in 1538, the ruling Danes outlawed its use in schools, churches and official documents. This maintained a rich spoken tradition, but for 300 years the language was not written down. This means that all poems and stories were handed down orally. These works were split into the following divisions: \"sagnir\" (historical), \"ævintyr\" (stories) and \"kvæði\" (ballads, often set to music and the mediaeval chain dance). These were eventually written down in the 19th century mostly by Danish scholars.\n\nTraditional Faroese music was primarily vocal, and was not accompanied by musical instruments. Only in Tórshavn instruments like fiddles were present in the older days. When trade grew in the 20th century the Faroese started to use imported musical instruments. Much of the imported music and instruments remained popular only in the capital and largest city, Tórshavn. Rural peoples remained true to traditions of the chain dance and ballads. The Faroese chain dance is a dance, which only survived in the Faroe Islands, while in other European countries it was banned by the church, due to its pagan origin. The dance is danced traditionally in a circle, but when a lot of people take part in the dance they usually let it swing around in various wobbles within the circle. There are no musical instruments used along with the dance, the dancers are singing ballads of various lengths, in either Faroese language or Danish, the latter of which is pronounced in Gøtudanskt. One man or woman leads the song by singing the first few words and then the others follow. The leader is called \"skipari\" (organizer). A ballad can be very long with a couple of hundred verses, which the skipari is expected to know by heart\n\nThe following description is by V. U. Hammershaimb, Færøsk Anthologi, 1891:\n\"The storyline of the ballad is attended by everybody with great interest, and if something especially pleasant or moving occurs, you can see it in the look and movement of the dancers – when the rage of the battle is described, the hands are clenched together, and when victory is in hand, they make cheering movements\".\n\nSuch is the importance of the dance as a cultural element that the Faroese refer to it as Faroese dance. However, it shall be stated that the dance hasn’t the same popularity it once had. This especially applies to younger generations.\n\nFaroese literature in the traditional sense of the word has only really developed in the past 100–200 years. This is mainly because the Faroese language was not written down in a standardised format until 1890 (in 1854 Venceslaus Ulricus Hammershaimb published a written standard for Modern Faroese that exists to this day. He produced orthography consistent with a continuous written tradition extending back to Old Norse). The Danish language was also encouraged at the expense of Faroese. Nevertheless, the Faroes have produced several authors and poets. The most famous of these authors are Jørgen-Frantz Jacobsen (known for his sole novel \"Barbara\") and William Heinesen. Both authors wrote in Danish. Other famous authors from the Faroes include Heðin Brú (\"The Old Man and His Sons\") and Jóanes Nielsen. Poets include the brothers Janus and Hans Andreas Djurhuus, and Rói Patursson.\nBoth Heinesen and Patursson have been awarded The Nordic Council's Literature Prize.\n\nAs with literature, painting only really took off in the 20th century in the Faroes. Famous Faroese painters include Sámuel Joensen-Mikines, Ingálvur av Reyni, Ruth Smith, Tróndur Patursson, Steffan Danielsen and Amariel Norðoy among others.\n\nLace knitting is a traditional handcraft of peoples of the Faroe Islands. The most distinguishing characteristic of Faroese lace shawls is the center back gusset shaping. Each shawl consists of two triangular side panels, a trapezoid-shaped back gusset, an edge treatment, and usually shoulder shaping.\n\nFootball is the most popular sport on the Faroe Islands, closely followed by handball, volleyball, rowing and swimming.\n\n60% of those who play sport on the islands play football. A 1-0 victory over Austria on 12 September 1990 still ranks as the greatest day in the history of football on the islands, but the national team has also recorded a number of impressive results against higher-ranked teams, primarily on home soil.\n\nAs of 1 July 2008, the Faroe Islands' international record (in UEFA European Championships qualifiers) was played 48, won 3, drawn 5, lost 40.\n\nFive different institutions run football schools, attended by 1,000 children each year. Todi Jónsson is probably the most famous player from the Faroe Islands of all times. He used to play for FC Copenhagen in Denmark and was the top scorer in the 2002/2003 season.\n\n\"Kappróður\" is the national sport of the Faroe Islands. There have been rowing competitions a long time back, at least as far back as to the 1930s, and now the competitions are still in a regular routine, held in seven different places during the weekends of June and July. The races are always part of a regional festival, called a stevna, with many other activities as well. The first regatta is always held in Klaksvík on Norðoyastevna in the first Saturday of June, sometimes it can be in the last Saturday of May. The final regatta is always held in Tórshavn on the national day, or actually on the day before the national day, which is called Ólavsøka. The boat race on Ólavsøka is the only race which is not necessarily held on a Saturday, but on the 28 July, whatever the day of the week it is. The regattas in between the Norðoyastevna and Ólavsøka are held in these locations: Jóansøka is every even year held in Vágur and every odd year in Tvøroyri, both villages are in Suðuroy (South Island), and this is the only place which is not possible to drive by car from Tórshavn, people have to take the ferry Smyril to Suðuroy, which is a two-hour journey. Jóansøka is held on a Saturday around the 24 June (St. John's Wake). Eystanstevna is always held in Runavík, but the boat race is only held there every second year (even years), odd years the regatta is held in Fuglafjørður at the Varmakelda Festival (Varmakeldustevna).\n\nSwimming is a quite popular sport in the Faroe Islands. The Faroese freestyle swimmer Pál Joensen is the sportsperson of the Faroe Islands with the best international result for the country, a bronze medal at the 2012 FINA World Swimming Championships. In July 2011 he qualified for the finals in the men's 800 meters and 1500 meters freestyle at the 2011 World Aquatics Championships in Shanghai. He placed fourth in the 1500 meter freestyle event, 0,67 second behind the bronze medalist. At the same competition, he placed fifth in the men's 800 meters freestyle. In 2010, Joensen won silver in the 1500 meter freestyle swimming event at the European Aquatics Championship. As of 2012, he trained in a 25 meter long pool because there was no 50 meter pool in the Faroe Islands. The first 50-meter swimming pool is under construction in Pál Joensens hometown Vágur, it is expected to open in 2015. It is named after Pál Joensen: Pálshøll\n\nJoensen competed at the Olympics in London 2012, but he didn't make it to the finals. He competed for Denmark, because the Faroe Islands are not allowed to compete at the Olympics, as they don't accept countries which are not independent. He swam for Denmark in the men's 400m free, 1500m free and the 4 × 200 meter freestyle relay. He was the first Faroese swimmer to compete at the Olympics. Pál Joensen has moved to live and study in Denmark after finishing high school in the Faroe Islands in August 2012. Only one other Faroese athlete has participated in the Olympics, Katrin Olsen was rowing in a double sculler in 2008, also for Denmark. The Faroe Islands are allowed to compete at the Paralympics under its own flag. Faroese swimmers have represented the Faroe Islands at the Paralympics since 1984. Christina Næss won the first and only (until now 9 September 2012) gold medal for the Faroe Islands at the 1988 Summer Paralympics. Katrin Johansen, Tóra við Keldu and Heidi Andreasen have won silver or bronze medals at the Paralympics. Only one person has competed in another sport than swimming at the Paralympics for the Faroe Islands, which was in table tennis in 1992 when Heini Festirstein competed.\n\nThe Faroe Islands compete in the biannual Island Games, which have been hosted by the islands in 1989. The Faroe Islands won the games in 2009 Island Games with 34 gold medals, 23 silver and 24 bronze.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4633230", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4633230", "title": "Duke of Denver", "text": "Duke of Denver\n\nThe fictitious title of Duke of Denver was created by Dorothy Sayers for the family of Lord Peter Wimsey. Lord Peter is the second of the three children of Mortimer Wimsey, 15th Duke of Denver. Gerald Wimsey, 16th Duke of Denver, and Peter's elder brother, is the chief murder suspect in \"Clouds of Witness\", in which he is tried by his peers, in full form in the House of Lords.\n\nC. W. Scott-Giles, Fitzalan Pursuivant of Arms Extraordinary, discussed the family with Miss Sayers from February 1936 until 1940, and they \"discovered\" many former Wimseys in their correspondence. These came in two types:\n\n\nA biographical note, supposedly by his uncle Paul Austin Delagardie, says: \n\nMiss Sayers published several articles and pamphlets on the Wimseys, including a series of \"Wimsey Papers\", the wartime letters of the family, which appeared in the \"Spectator\" from November 1939 to January 1940. After that she turned to her translation of Dante and other religious works. Scott-Giles writes that they met often, but he never ventured to bring up the Wimseys.\n\nAfter her death, he wrote an article on Wimsey heraldry (\"Coat of Arms\", January 1959), and a correspondent discovered a crux. The Wimseys are well-established as being of unbroken succession for sixteen generations (although, as will be seen below, Miss Sayers' genealogy found this too simple) but Gerald Wimsey is described at his trial as \"Duke of Denver, in the Peerage of Great Britain and Ireland\", which would mean that the title was created after the Union with Ireland, which was passed on 2 July 1800 and came into effect on the following St. Sylvester's Day (New Year's Eve).\n\nScott-Giles answered this in the manner of a Baker Street Irregular, by assuming that all the data given by Miss Sayers were correct, and coming up with an explanation to save the appearances, and he eventually produced a book on the House of Wimsey. He invented no Wimseys, which explains certain blanks in the list, but he enlarged some from half a sentence.\n\n\nThe arms were altered from 'Sable, three plates argent' when a crusading Wimsey advised his King to watch a besieged city as closely as a cat his mousehole. The family chronicles record this as being Richard the Lion-Hearted at Acre; the arms were actually changed after Edward I's crusade while Prince. (Gerald de Wimsey also fought for Prince Edward against Simon de Montfort at the battle of Evesham and elsewhere.)\n\nRoger de Wimsey, his father, supported de Montfort; ever since, there has been a Wimsey on each side of civil strife, to preserve the family estates and intercede for their lives.\n\nGerald's grandfather, Peter de Guimsey, had guided King John across the Wash in 1215, and was very assiduous in searching for the King's treasury after it was swept away. He must have been unsuccessful, for none of it was handed in.\n\nThe supporters were adopted under Elizabeth; the badge, now unused, goes back to when Peter, Earl of Denver, left Richard III's camp on the eve of the Battle of Bosworth. One of King Richard's supporters sent a hangman's rope after him, so that he could get used to the feel; Earl Peter knotted it and sent it back.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Edward I of England summoned his good servant Gerald de Wimsey to Parliament, the king created a barony by writ: an hereditary title, and an hereditary right to be summoned to Parliament. It is inherited according to strict customary law: If a Baron Wimsey leaves sons, the eldest succeeds him; if he leaves an only daughter, she succeeds him (compare Baron Noel). If he dies without descendants, the title goes to the children of the previous Lord Wimsey by the same rules; this usually means his next eldest brother succeeds.\n\nIf he leaves no sons, but several daughters, the rules are different: The title is left in abeyance between the daughters, and no-one succeeds. When all but one of the daughters die without offspring, or the offspring of all but one of them die out, the remaining daughter or her heir \"automatically\" succeed, as if she had been an only daughter all along. (The Crown may, of its grace, choose one of the heirs involved to succeed \"before\" all but one of them die out. It may choose the heir of a younger daughter over the older, and has done so.)\n\nThe other Wimsey titles were granted by letters patent, which specified inheritance by heirs male: no daughters could succeed, and no-one could succeed through descent from a daughter.\n\nThe 12th Duke of Denver died in 1817 without children, or siblings, and with him the male line from the first Earl of Denver died out. As a result, his higher titles became extinct; and the Barony of Wimsey went into abeyance between his aunts, as daughters of the 10th Duke.\n\nIf Colonel George Wimsey had not died at the Battle of Waterloo, he would have succeeded, as the only other descendant in the male line of the Earls and Dukes of Denver. (Younger Wimsey sons led adventurous lives; and the practice of having one Wimsey on each side of a civil war kept the property together, but took a high toll in deaths, attainders, and executions.) Colonel Wimsey left an only daughter, Grace, who married a Charles Wimsey from another branch of the family; he was descended from the Barons Wimsey, and also from a daughter of the 6th Duke.\n\nNeither of them inherited any titles, but the 12th Duke arranged for them to inherit the \"lands\". In recognition of this, and the multiple family connexion, Charles Wimsey was created, in 1820, Viscount St. George, Earl and Duke of Denver. Although strictly first Duke of the new creation, he is almost always called (as in the case of Lord De La Warr) 13th Duke of Denver, since the title was recreated promptly in the same family.\n\nCharles Wimsey, 13th Duke of Denver, was the son of Sir Bredon Wimsey, a cadet of the Wimseys, to whom the 12th Duke transferred the Wimsey properties (the entails lapsed at his death). Sir Bredon was descended from John Wimsey, Colonel in the Parliamentary armies, during the English Civil War; who descended in turn from a brother of the first Earl. Matthew Wimsey, Lord Peter's third cousin, the family archivist, would himself descend from a younger son of this Sir Bredon, and thus have no claim on any of the family titles.\n\nColonel Wimsey was assigned to watch over Duke's Denver and Bredon Hall, in the interests of the Commonwealth of England, while the seventh Duke was in exile as a Royalist after the Battle of Worcester. The Colonel did his duty to his government and his family. The Wimsey estates survived the war intact, and Colonel Wimsey's small force did its best to prevent Bredon Hall being used for Royalist intrigue.\n\nThe Duke, however, managed to get into the broad Wimsey lands at night, dressed as \"Captain Brown\", and his efforts helped to persuade the Earl of Manchester to support the Restoration of Charles II. After the Restoration, \"Captain Brown\" invited Colonel Wimsey to visit Bredon Hall again, and in short order, Colonel John Wimsey married the Duke's sister, Lady Elizabeth Wimsey.\n\nThe descent from the Colonel is not specified; but the Wimsey papers tell us that Captain Henry Wimsey, RN, was a nephew of the 7th Duke, whom his uncle had taken sailing in the yacht which had been used by Captain Brown. He lived to a ripe old age, and his son and grandson were admirals; his sea stories may have inspired Horatio Nelson. He is presumably the younger son of Colonel John and Lady Elizabeth: if the 6th Duke had been his \"paternal\" grandfather, his descendants would have had to be extinct by 1817.\n\nLady Grace Wimsey was, as said, the daughter of\n\n\nThis Richard Wimsey was a \"much older first cousin\" of the 10th Duke (which implies that \"fourth cousin\" above = \"third cousin once removed\", as it can), who was also the Duke's next heir after his only son. This makes it likely, but not certain, that he was born about 1685, and his father was the Lord Richard Wimsey who met Evelyn.\n\nGerald Christian Wimsey, 16th Duke of Denver, was elder brother of Lord Peter Wimsey. He appeared most notably as chief murder suspect in the novel \"Clouds of Witness\", where he is tried in the House of Lords but eventually acquitted through his brother's efforts.\n\nAccording to the novel \"The Attenbury Emeralds\", he died 1951 from a heart attack during a fire at Duke's Denver. As his son, the Viscount St George (a fighter pilot) did not survive the Second World War, his brother Peter inherits the title.\n\nThe former Lord Peter Wimsey accepted the title rather reluctantly. However, out of a sense of duty, he left his former life in London behind, moving to Duke's Denver, rebuilding the estate, and picking up life as a landowner. See also the novel \"The Late Scholar\".\n\n\"Except for the first, these are not to be taken as factual.\"\n\n\n\nThere were three Elizabethans called Lord Christian Wimsey. Lord Peter's mother wrote to him, in the \"Wimsey Letters\":\n\nScott-Giles feels this is a bit much, even for an Elizabethan Wimsey, and suggests that the Dowager Duchess had confounded the accomplishments of different Lords Christian.\n\n\n"}

It is a common cuisine eaten in most former Castilian territories in Latin America and the Philippines. The first written references to the Majorcan ensaïmada date back to the 17th century. At that time, although wheat flour was mainly used for making bread, there is evidence that this typical pastry product was made for festivals and celebrations.\n\nThe \"ensaïmada de Mallorca\" is made with strong flour, water, sugar, eggs, mother dough and a kind of reduced pork lard named \"saïm\". The handmade character of the product makes it difficult to give an exact formula, so scales have been established defining the proportion of each ingredient, giving rise to an excellent quality traditional product. The name comes from the Catalan word \"saïm\", which means 'pork lard' (from the Arabic \"shahim\", meaning 'fat').\n\nIn Mallorca and Ibiza there is a sweet called greixonera made with ensaïmada pieces left over from the day before.\n\nAmong the variants of ensaimada the most common are:\n\nThe Philippines also adopted the Majorcan ensaïmada (commonly spelled \"ensaymada\" in Philippine languages). As a Spanish colony for over 300 years, the Philippine variant has evolved over the centuries and is perhaps one of the most common delicacies in the country. The localized pastry is a brioche baked with butter instead of lard and topped with grated cheese and sugar. Upscale versions of ensaymada can be topped with butter cream and sugar. During Christmas season, it is a tradition to top the pastry with a specially aged type of Edam cheese called \"queso de bola\". It is also customary to eat ensaymada with hot chocolate and strawberries during Christmas. Due to its extreme popularity as a snack across the islands, popular bakeshop chains such as Goldilocks, Red Ribbon, Julie's and Kamuning Bakery also offer ensaymada with their own recipe.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, another Spanish colony until 1898, the ensaïmada is called \"Mallorca\" and is traditionally eaten for breakfast or as an afternoon snack.\n\n"}
{"id": "20836295", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20836295", "title": "Entomological warfare", "text": "Entomological warfare\n\nEntomological warfare (EW) is a type of biological warfare that uses insects to attack the enemy. The concept has existed for centuries and research and development have continued into the modern era. EW has been used in battle by Japan and several other nations have developed and been accused of using an entomological warfare program.\n\nEntomological warfare (EW) is a specific type of biological warfare (BW) that uses insects in a direct attack or as vectors to deliver a biological agent, such as plague or cholera. Essentially, EW exists in three varieties. One type of EW involves infecting insects with a pathogen and then dispersing the insects over target areas. The insects then act as a vector, infecting any person or animal they might bite. Another type of EW is a direct insect attack against crops; the insect may not be infected with any pathogen but instead represents a threat to agriculture. The final method of entomological warfare is to use uninfected insects, such as bees, to directly attack the enemy.\n\nEntomological warfare is not a new concept; historians and writers have studied EW in connection to multiple historic events. A 14th century plague epidemic in Asia Minor that eventually became known as the Black Death (carried by fleas) is one such event that has drawn attention from historians as a possible early incident of entomological warfare. That plague's spread over Europe may have been the result of a biological attack on the Crimean city of Kaffa.\n\nAccording to Jeffrey Lockwood, author of \"\" (a book about EW), the earliest incident of entomological warfare was probably the use of bees by early humans. The bees or their nests were thrown into caves to force the enemy out and into the open. Lockwood theorizes that the Ark of the Covenant may have been deadly when opened because it contained deadly fleas.\n\nDuring the American Civil War the Confederacy accused the Union of purposely introducing the harlequin bug in the South. These accusations were never proven, and modern research has shown it more likely that the insect arrived by other means. The world did not experience large-scale entomological warfare until World War II; Japanese attacks in China were the only verified instance of BW or EW during the war. During, and following, the war other nations began their own EW programs.\n\nFrance is known to have pursued entomological warfare programs during World War II. Like Germany, the nation suggested that the Colorado potato beetle, aimed at the enemy's food sources, would be an asset during the war. As early as 1939 biological warfare experts in France suggested that the beetle be used against German crops.\n\nGermany is known to have pursued entomological warfare programs during World War II. The nation pursued the mass-production, and dispersion, of the Colorado potato beetle (\"Lepinotarsa decemlineata\"), aimed at the enemy's food sources. The beetle was first found in Germany in 1914, as an invasive species from North America. There are no records that indicate the beetle was ever employed as a weapon by Germany, or any other nation during the war. Regardless, the Germans had developed plans to drop the beetles on English crops.\n\nGermany carried out testing of its Colorado potato beetle weaponization program south of Frankfurt, where they released 54,000 of the beetles. In 1944, an infestation of Colorado potato beetles was reported in Germany. The source of the infestation is unknown, speculation has offered three alternative theories as to the origin of the infestation. One option is Allied action, an entomological attack, another is that it was the result of the German testing, and still another more likely explanation is that it was merely a natural occurrence.\n\nAmong the Allied Powers, Canada led the pioneering effort in vector-borne warfare. After Japan became intent on developing the plague flea as a weapon, Canada and the United States followed suit. Cooperating closely with the United States, Dr. G.B. Reed, chief of Kingston's Queen's University's Defense Research Laboratory, focused his research efforts on mosquito vectors, biting flies, and plague infected fleas during World War II. Much of this research was shared with or conducted in concert with the United States.\n\nCanada's entire bio-weapons program was ahead of the British and the Americans during the war. The Canadians tended to work in areas their allies ignored; entomological warfare was one of these areas. As the U.S. and British programs evolved, the Canadians worked closely with both nations. The Canadian BW work would continue well after the war, including entomological research.\n\nJapan used entomological warfare on a large scale during World War II in China. Unit 731, Japan's infamous biological warfare unit led by Lt. General Shirō Ishii, used plague-infected fleas and flies covered with cholera to infect the population in China. The Japanese military dispersed the insects by spraying them from low-flying airplanes and dropping bombs filled with a mixture of insects and disease. Localized and deadly epidemics resulted and nearly 500,000 Chinese died of disease. An international symposium of historians declared in 2002 that Japanese entomological warfare in China was responsible for the deaths of 440,000.\n\nThe late Ban Shigeo, a technician at the Japanese Army's 9th Technical Research Institute, left a rare and valuable account of the activities of Noborito Research Institute, which was published in Rikugun Noborito Kenkyujo no shinjitsu – The Truth About the Army Nororito Institute (available only in the Japanese language). Of the Japanese Army's ten numbered institutes, only the 9th Army Technical Research Institute came under the covert operations section of the Army General Staff's Second Bureau (Intelligence). On the sensitive issue of Japanese biological warfare, Ban did not shrink from including an account of his trip to Nanking in 1941 to participate in the testing of poisons on Chinese prisoners. One of his book's contributions is to further tie Noborito to the Japanese Army's infamous Unit 731, which participated in biomedical research. When the war ended, the US Army quietly enlisted certain members of Noborito in its efforts against the communist camp in the early years of the Cold War. The author notes near the end of the book that Ban led the \"chemical section\" of a US clandestine unit hidden within Yokosuka naval base during the Korean War, and then worked on unspecified projects inside the United States from 1955 to 1959, before returning to Japan to enter the private sector. Shirō Ishii of Unit 731, having not been charged as a war criminal, also continued his work to consult with American authorities, especially during the height of the Cold War, and died in 1959 of throat cancer.\n\nIn 1989, a British study of Unit 731 strongly supported the theory of United States-Japanese BW culpability in Korea. Chinese experts insist today that BW weapons created in an American-Japanese collaboration were used in the Korean war.\n\nA British scientist, J.B.S. Haldane, suggested that Britain and Germany were both vulnerable to entomological attack via the Colorado potato beetle. In 1942 the United States shipped 15,000 Colorado potato beetles to Britain for study as a weapon.\n\nThe Soviet Union researched, developed and tested an entomological warfare program as a major part of an anti-crop and anti-animal BW program. The Soviets developed techniques for using insects to transmit animal pathogens, such as foot and mouth disease—which they used ticks to transmit. The nation also used avian ticks to transmit \"Chlamydophila psittaci\" to chickens. In addition, the Soviet Union claimed to have developed an automated mass insect breeding facility, capable of outputting millions of parasitic insects per day.\n\nThe United States seriously researched the potential of entomological warfare during the Cold War. The United States military developed plans for an entomological warfare facility, designed to produce 100 million yellow fever-infected mosquitoes per month. A U.S. Army report titled \"Entomological Warfare Target Analysis\" listed vulnerable sites within the Soviet Union that the U.S. could attack using entomological vectors. The military also tested the mosquito biting capacity by dropping uninfected mosquitoes over U.S. cities.\n\nNorth Korean and Chinese officials leveled accusations that during the Korean War the United States engaged in biological warfare, including EW, in North Korea. The claim is dated to the period of the war, and has been thoroughly denied by the U.S. In 1998, Stephen Endicott and Edward Hagermann claimed that the accusations were true in their book, \"The United States and Biological Warfare: Secrets from the Early Cold War and Korea\" The book received mixed reviews, some called it \"bad history\" and \"appalling\", while other praised the case the authors made. Other historians have revived the claim in recent decades as well. The same year Endicotts' book was published Kathryn Weathersby and Milton Leitenberg of the Cold War International History Project at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington released a cache of Soviet and Chinese documents which revealed the North Korean claim was an elaborate disinformation campaign.\n\nDuring the 1950s the United States conducted a series of field tests using entomological weapons. Operation Big Itch, in 1954, was designed to test munitions loaded with uninfected fleas (\"Xenopsylla cheopis\"). Big Itch went awry when some of the fleas escaped into the plane and bit all three members of the air crew. In May 1955 over 300,000 uninfected mosquitoes (\"Aedes aegypti\") were dropped over parts of the U.S. state of Georgia to determine if the air-dropped mosquitoes could survive to take meals from humans. The mosquito tests were known as Operation Big Buzz. Operation Magic Sword was a 1965 U.S. military operation designed to test the effectiveness of the sea-borne release of insect vectors for biological agents. The U.S. engaged in at least two other EW testing programs, Operation Drop Kick and Operation May Day. A 1981 Army report outlined these tests as well as multiple cost-associated issues that occurred with EW. The report is partially declassified—some information is blacked out, including everything concerning \"Drop Kick\"—and included \"cost per death\" calculations. The cost per death, according to the report, for a vector-borne biological agent achieving a 50% mortality rate in an attack on a city was $0.29 in 1976 dollars. Such an attack was estimated to result in 625,000 deaths.\n\nAt Kadena Air Force Base, an Entomology Branch of the U.S. Army Preventive Medicine Activity, U.S. Army Medical Center was used to grow \"medically important\" arthropods, including many strains of mosquitoes in a study of disease vector efficiency. The program reportedly supported a research program studying taxonomic and ecological data surveys for the Smithsonian Institution.\"\nThe Smithsonian Institution and The National Academy of Sciences and National Research Council administered special research projects in the Pacific. The Far East Section of the Office of the Foreign Secretary administered two such projects which focused \"on the flora of Okinawa\" and \"trapping of airborne insects and arthropods for the study of the natural dispersal of insects and arthropods over the ocean.\" The motivation for civilian research programs of this nature was questioned when it was learned that such international research was in fact funded by and provided to the U.S. Army as requirement related to the U.S. military's biological warfare research.\n\nThe United States has also applied entomological warfare research and tactics in non-combat situations. In 1990 the U.S. funded a $6.5 million program designed to research, breed and drop caterpillars. The caterpillars were to be dropped in Peru on coca fields as part of the American War on Drugs. As recently as 2002 U.S. entomological anti-drug efforts at Fort Detrick were focused on finding an insect vector for a virus that affects the opium poppy.\n\nClemson University's Regulatory and Public Service Program listed \"diseases vectored by insects\" among bioterrorism scenarios considered \"most likely\". Because invasive species are already a problem worldwide one University of Nebraska entomologist considered it likely that the source of any sudden appearance of a new agricultural pest would be difficult, if not impossible, to determine. Lockwood considers insects a more effective means of transmitting biological agents for acts of bioterrorism than the actual agents. Insect vectors are easily gathered and their eggs easily transportable without detection. Isolating and delivering biological agents, on the other hand, is extremely challenging and hazardous.\n\nIn one of the few suspected acts of entomological bioterrorism an eco-terror group known as The Breeders claimed to have released Mediterranean fruit flies (medflies) amidst an ongoing California infestation. Lockwood asserts that there is some evidence the group played a role in the event. The pest attacks a variety of crops and the state of California responded with a large-scale pesticide spraying program. At least one source asserted that there is no doubt that an outside hand played a role in the dense 1989 infestation. The group stated in a letter to then Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley that their goals were twofold. They sought to cause the medfly infestation to grow out of control which, in turn, would render the ongoing malathion spraying program financially infeasible.\n\nThe Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention (BWC) of 1972 does not specifically mention insect vectors in its text. The language of the treaty, however, does cover vectors. Article I bans \"Weapons, equipment or means of delivery designed to use such agents or toxins for hostile purposes or in armed conflict.\" It would appear, due to the text of the BWC, that insect vectors as an aspect of entomological warfare are covered and outlawed by the Convention. The issue is less clear when warfare with uninfected insects against crops is considered.\n\nIt has been suggested that insects could get genetically engineered via technologies such as CRISPR to create GMO \"killer mosquitoes\" that cause plagues that wipe out staple crops.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5069239", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5069239", "title": "Final Fantasy Type-0", "text": "Final Fantasy Type-0\n\nThe story focuses on Class Zero, a group of fourteen students from the Vermillion Peristylium, a magical academy in the Dominion of Rubrum. When the Militesi Empire launches an assault on the other Crystal States of Orience, seeking to control their respective crystals, Class Zero is mobilized for the defense of Rubrum. Eventually, the group becomes entangled in the secrets behind both the war and the reason for their existence. The setting and presentation were inspired by historical documentaries, and the story itself was written to be darker than other \"Final Fantasy\" titles.\n\nThe game was originally announced as a title for mobile phones and the PSP called It was directed by Hajime Tabata, who took up the project after completing \"\". Initially designed to provide players with easy access to the \"Fabula Nova Crystallis\" universe, the mobile version was eventually cancelled and the game's title was changed to distance it from the subseries' flagship title \"Final Fantasy XIII\". Releasing to strong sales, it received praise for its story and gameplay, but was criticized for its camera control and artificial intelligence. Further games related to \"Type-0\" have also been developed, including a high definition remaster that released internationally in March 2015.\n\"Final Fantasy Type-0\" is an action role-playing video game in which the player controls the 14 members of Class Zero, who are sent on missions across Orience. Outside environments such as the Vermillion Peristylium (Class Zero's home base) and dedicated missions, the game world of Orience is navigated via a scaled-down world map. Class Zero are sent on missions across Orience during the course of the game. The player initially travels to preset destinations in the world on an airship supplied by the Peristylium, but gains their own airship to freely navigate the world map with after defeating a powerful enemy guarding it. The main gameplay is presented in a mission-based structure. The two types of missions encountered are story-based missions, and \"Practice\" missions, which act as side-quests. During missions, optional orders are issued which can be obeyed or ignored as the player chooses. Should they be accepted, the characters receive a temporary power boost, and completing the objectives yields rewards. Players can also engage in real-time strategy battles on the world map, with the player taking control of allied military divisions. Missions involve liberating cities and towns from enemy forces. Timed aerial missions are also available where the characters shoot down attacking dragons using their airship's weapons.\n\nWhile outside combat, players can breed chocobos, recurring galliform birds in the \"Final Fantasy\" series. Players must capture two chocobos on the world map and take them to a special ranch within the Peristylium: by pairing certain chocobos and adding specific items, a special chocobo can be bred for use. Players can visit the Peristylium Crystarium to review defeated enemies, character information, in-game lore and special video clips. Moogles, another recurring creature in the series, hand out missions to the player: the objectives of missions can change during gameplay. Items and new equipment can be bought from shops managed by non-player characters (NPCs) both within the Peristylium and across Orience. Towns liberated during missions give access to a wider range of shops. After completing the game once, players unlock a \"New Game+\" option: in this mode, players keep their stats and weapons from the previous playthrough, while also unlocking story scenes and character-specific missions. \"Type-0\" features three difficulty levels; \"normal\", \"hard\", and \"impossible\".\n\n\"Type-0\" uses a real-time, action-based battle system similar to the system used in \"\". The player is allowed access to three characters, which they can swap between at any time. The two not being controlled are managed by the game's artificial intelligence. Each character has a specific weapon, and special attacks unique to a character are unlocked as they gain experience levels. During combat, characters lock onto targets while attacking and can switch targets. Characters are able to perform precisely timed attacks during the period when an enemy unit is attacking: the \"Break Sight\", which deals high damage, and the \"Kill Sight\", which kills a standard enemy with a single hit. Three characters can also be commanded to use a combining their attacks to deal higher damage to a target. Aside from human enemies, the game features multiple recurring \"Final Fantasy\" monsters. In addition to enemies encountered in missions, there are special enemies that can be encountered while exploring the world map.\n\nDefeated enemy units drop a substance called Phantoma. The color of Phantoma indicates what aspect of the character it will replenish, though in general they automatically replenish a set amount of magic points. Phantoma are used in the game's leveling system, the Altocrystarium, to strengthen a character's magic skills. The game's magic skills are divided into five basic groups named after types of guns: for example, \"Rifle\" fires the spell in a straight line, while \"Missile\" homes in on and chases targeted enemies. Holding down the assigned action button increases the power of the attack. Many combat situations involve timed challenges. Success rewards the character, while failure drains their health. If a character is defeated in battle, the player can instantly select another to replace it, and the defeated character must be revived outside the mission. The game features an arena where practice fights take place. While these fights are not against real foes, the characters continue to level up and gain Phantoma after the battle, and twenty battles can be arranged at any one time. Each character has access to summoned monsters called which act as temporary playable characters and have their own set of skills. Summoning them empties the selected character's health gauge, removing them from battle until they are revived. Summons are also affected by the current environment: as an example, Shiva's powers are stronger in snowy weather. After a limited time in battle, the Eidolons are dismissed. Those available to players are series staples Shiva, Ifrit, Golem, Odin, Diablos and Bahamut. Each Eidolon has variants of its original form, many of which are unlocked as the game progresses.\n\nCharacters can continue to level up through activities within the Peristylium while the PSP is in sleep mode, the game's UMD is running, and the PSP is charging. The multiplayer function, activated through the game's configuration screen, allows two other players to jump into another host player's game via an online connection. The allotted time for multiplayer is limited to a few minutes, with transitions between zones triggering the end of a multiplayer section. The time limit can be extended by players helping their current host. The first and last segments of the game are not open to multiplayer. There is also a function called Magical Academy Assist, in which NPCs named after members of the game's production team are summoned into battle to assist the cadets.\n\n\"Note: The plot of Type-0 is the same in its original version and the high-definition remaster Final Fantasy Type-0 HD, so the terms and quotes used in the text are from the localization of the high-definition remaster rather than unofficial translations.\"\n\n\"Final Fantasy Type-0\" is set within Orience, a land divided between four nations or \"Crystal States\". Each nation has crystals of power based on the Four Symbols, which are in turn their national emblems. The Dominion of Rubrum uses the Vermillion Bird Crystal, which controls magic; the Milites Empire controls the White Tiger Crystal, containing the power of science and weapons; the Kingdom of Concordia uses the Azure Dragon Crystal, containing the power of Dragons; and the Lorican Alliance is home to the Black Tortoise Crystal, containing the power of shielding. Each nation has an academy, or Peristylium, to research and protect the country's respective crystal. The crystals have the ability to mark humans as their countries' servants. These servants, called l'Cie, are branded with a symbol and are given a \"Focus\", a task to complete. While blessed with long life and the ability to transform into crystal, l'Cie are cursed to lose their memories over time. The people of Orience also lose their memories of the dead so they will not be held back by any past regrets and continue strengthening their souls through conflict, a mechanism put in place by the crystals for the convenience of the deities who crafted them. The main aim of many characters is to become Agito, a legendary figure who will appear and save the world from Tempus Finis, an apocalyptic event that will destroy Orience.\n\nThe main characters of \"Final Fantasy Type-0\" are Class Zero, an elite group of 14 students from the Vermillion Peristylium. The first 12 are card wielder Ace, flute wielder Deuce, the archer Trey, magic-gun wielder Cater, the mace-wielding Cinque, scythe wielder Sice, whip wielder Seven, martial artist Eight, spearman Nine, katana wielding Jack, swordswoman Queen and dual pistol wielding King. The last two, Machina Kunagiri and Rem Tokimiya, double as narrators and the focus for the game's main subplot. Supporting Class Zero are their mentor Kurasame Susaya, and Arecia Al-Rashia, Class Zero's former mentor and the overseer for magical development at the Vermillion Peristylium. Other important characters from Rubrum are Khalia Chival VI, the current leader of Rubrum and headmaster of the Vermillion Peristyrium, and the l'Cie Caetuna. Multiple Militesi figures, led by Marshal Cid Aulstyne, act as the game's main antagonists. Other important characters include the Concordian queen Andoria, Gala, leader of the Rursus Army and the instigator of Tempus Finis, and Joker and Tiz, two mysterious figures who observe the events of the game.\n\nMarshal Cid Aulstyne leads the army of Milites against the other nations of Orience, launching a devastating attack against the Vermillion Peristylium and neutralising the Vermillion Bird Crystal using a crystal jammer. Class Zero, immune to the effects of the jammer, repel the invasion. During the conflict Izana Kunagiri, Machina's older brother, is killed while on a mission for Class Zero. This event later creates a rift between Machina and Class Zero. Coordinated by Kurasame and Arecia Al-Rashia, Class Zero plays a key role in freeing Rubrum's territories and launching counterattacks in alliance with Concordia, while Lorica's capital is destroyed by a Militesi bomb. Andoria, Concordia's queen, then forces a ceasefire between the remaining nations. During peace talks in the Militesi capital, Class Zero is framed for Andoria's murder, resulting in Concordia's puppet government and Milites launching a united assault on Rubrum. During their flight, Machina storms off after clashing with Class Zero, and becomes a White Tiger l'Cie to protect Rem from his brother's fate before returning to them. The White Tiger Crystal's will eventually forces him to leave.\n\nWith help from its l'Cie soldiers and Class Zero, Rubrum destroys the forces of Concordia and Milites, uniting Orience under its flag. This triggers the arrival of Tempus Finis, with the Rursus Army emerging from the magical fortress Pandaemonium to wipe out Orience's population. Cid and Class Zero each travel to Pandaemonium: Cid attempts to become Agito and is transformed into the Rursus Arbiter by Gala, while Class Zero resolve to halt Tempus Finis. As Class Zero face the trials of the Arbiter, the Vermillion Bird Crystal offers them the chance to become l'Cie. During the original playthrough, if Class Zero accepts the offer, they go into battle against the Rursus and die, dooming Orience to be destroyed in Tempus Finis and reborn in another spiral of history. \n\nClass Zero refuse the Crystal's offer and Rem is made a l'Cie in their place. Machina and Rem end up fighting each other in Pandaemonium: Rem is mortally wounded, and she and Machina turn to crystal. Severely weakened by the trials and demoralized at seeing Machina and Rem's condition, Class Zero are initially unable to defeat the Arbiter. Machina and Rem's spirits give them the strength they need to defeat the Arbiter and halt Tempus Finis. Fatally injured, Class Zero spend their final minutes imagining their possible post-war lives. They are found by Machina and Rem, who have returned to human form and, along with the rest of Orience, are allowed to remember the dead. In a post-credits sequence, it is said that the Crystal States fall into turmoil as the Crystals lose their powers. Machina and Rem unite Orience and rebuild the world, and Machina records Class Zero's history before dying with Rem at his side. \n\nA second playthrough reveals that Orience is trapped in a stable timeloop created by Arecia and Gala, the respective servants of the deities Pulse and Lindzei, as part of an experiment to find the gateway to the Unseen Realm. Competing with each other to open the gateway using a different method, both failed and reset the world for another attempt. By the events of \"Type-0\", the experiment had been performed over six hundred million times. Cid, aware of the cycle, wanted to free Orience from the Crystals' control, and killed himself in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent Gala from using him. In a sequence unlocked during the second playthrough, Joker and Tiz speak with Arecia after the Arbiter's defeat and show her the memories of Class Zero and the people of Orience to make her reconsider restarting the experiment. After speaking with Machina and Rem, Arecia decides to abandon the experiment and returns the two to human form. In an alternate ending, Arecia chooses to remove the crystals from Orience's history, creating a new timeline where the war never occurred and the world's population can live happily.\n\n\"Final Fantasy Type-0\" was originally titled \"Final Fantasy Agito XIII\", envisioned as a game for mobile devices. It was conceived in 2005 as part of \"Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy\", a subseries of \"Final Fantasy\" games linked by a common mythos. \"Agito XIII\" was the final original \"Fabula Nova Crystallis\" game to be created. The decision to make it a mobile game was based on the popularity of \"\". Hajime Tabata, who contributed to the \"Fabula Nova Crystallis\" mythos, was searching for a new project after finishing \"Before Crisis\" and became the game's director. \"Before Crisis\" producer Kosei Ito acted as producer before his move to Capcom prior to 2009. Beginning development in 2006, it was first announced at that year's Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3). It was said to offer on-the-go access to the \"Fabula Nova Crystallis\" universe, using gameplay functions exclusive to mobile phones of the time. The concept was to deliver a game for mobile platforms equivalent to a console game from the main \"Final Fantasy\" series, and to make it available in its entirety upon release rather than in episodic format.\n\nDevelopers had been planning a release on the next generation of mobile phones, as those available at the time could not offer all the capabilities they would need. While it was originally claimed to be a mobile exclusive, versions for both mobiles and the PlayStation Portable were being developed, with the latter to be revealed when the former was sufficiently advanced. The original staff members were Tabata, Yusuke Naora and Tetsuya Nomura. Nomura acted as a character designer and creative producer. Between 2006 and 2008, development wavered between inactivity and sluggishness since most of the team was devoted to \"\". In 2008, it was said to be facing serious problems due to the scale of the project. An issue developers had grappled with was whether or not to make the command buttons used in the game visible on the mobile screen. \"Agito XIII\" was described as an online RPG using fully rendered 3D graphics similar to console games, as well as having gameplay elements from multiple genres such as MMORPGs, smaller-scale multiplayer-focused games, and standard role-playing games. Other unfinished concepts being developed were a day-night cycle, a calendar system linked to real-world time and dates, and a story influenced by player votes.\n\nIn 2008, it was decided to make \"Type-0\" a PSP exclusive, cancelling the mobile version of the game as the developers did not want to wait for mobile technology to reach a level which could handle their full vision for the game. Full development began that year by the same team who developed \"Crisis Core\", but was again slowed as most of them were completing work on \"The 3rd Birthday\". Because of these conflicting projects, \"Type-0\" came close to being cancelled outright. Between 2009 and 2011, the title was changed to distance it from \"Final Fantasy XIII\", since after the platform change the two games had little in common other than their shared mythos. One of the titles considered and rejected was \"Final Fantasy Live\", referring to the game's multiplayer element. The new title, \"Final Fantasy Type-0,\" was intended to indicate the game's separation from the main series. It was also the beginning of an alternative numbering system parallel to the main series. The game made its first official public appearance under the new title at the Square Enix 1st Production Department Premier in Tokyo, along with a new trailer that was released to the public on January 27, 2011.\n\n\"Type-0\"s scenario was conceived by Tabata and written by Hiroki Chiba and Sarah Okabe. While the game was still titled \"Agito XIII\", Tabata described it as \"a major title [...] formed from a variety of concepts\" which included the collision of four fantasies (the game's view of Orience), a battle between magic and weapons, and the two sides of reality. The early story concept drew heavily from popular manga and anime, but little survived after the platform change. Tabata instead chose a new style similar to historical films and documentaries. The new story's concept started with the idea of a war story told by young people caught up in the event, with its story themes revolving around death and its impact on others. A major inspiration was the Japanese documentary series \"Centuries of Picture\". The final story was darker than many other \"Final Fantasy\" games. Despite its title change, the game was kept within the \"Fabula Nova Crystallis\" mythos. The approach taken with the mythos was to portray the roles of its deities from a historical standpoint, while telling a story focused on the human side of events. The cyclic nature of the game's universe was created to help incorporate aspects of the mythos. The roles and backgrounds for each character in the game were conceived and put into place after the setting and main story had been finalized. After the game's release, Tabata commented that when he was writing the story he would have liked to have been more thorough, and to have made the story easier for players to understand.\n\nThe game's logo artwork was drawn by regular series artist Yoshitaka Amano. The kanji symbol used in the logo was drawn by Naora, who had designed the Shinra logo in \"Final Fantasy VII\" and its companion media. Naora specifically requested that he draw the logo due to this previous experience. To achieve the grittier atmosphere, Naora took a research trip to a Japanese military camp to learn what being a military cadet was like. The island of the Vermillion Perystilium was based on an offshore Japanese island he had visited prior to his involvement with the game, adding elements in-game such as an offshore ship wreck to symbolize his fear of the sea. He was also influenced by an incident where he saw a dead cat surrounded by other cats to portray the bond between members of Class Zero, and the game's themes, in promotional artwork.\n\nThe gameplay was inspired by the multi-character system of \"Before Crisis\", while the naming of magic styles after weapons of war made reference to first-person shooters. The combat was designed to be filled with tension and portray each playable character's personality on the battlefield. The Eidolons were originally not controlled in realtime, but during the development of Ifrit, Tabata did some testing with real-time commands. The results impressed him enough that he decided to overcome the technical difficulties involved and make the Eidolons controllable. Due to technical restrictions and the presence of the Academy Assist function, the game's artificial intelligence for playable characters needed to be limited to healing, survival and other minor actions. The game's multiplayer was deliberately designed around restricted segments. Its development was still ongoing during the summer of 2011, with a temporary stoppage of PlayStation Network that year negatively affecting its development. Because of the size of the project, debugging the game took far longer than anticipated. Between the release of the demo and the full game, adjustments were made to gameplay mechanics and the in-game camera. In a post-release interview, Tabata commented that he would have liked to expand the multiplayer functions to include an ad-hoc function and expanded cooperative gameplay, and create a more forgiving learning curve for players.\n\nThe music for \"Type-0\" was composed by Takeharu Ishimoto. He had previously composed the music for \"Before Crisis\", \"Crisis Core\" and \"The World Ends with You\". Ishimoto gave the music a dark and heavy feel, describing the themes as \"war, life, and death\". He used less rock elements than in his previous games to promote a feeling of immersion. One of his primary instruments was the guitar, which Ishimoto played himself during recording sessions. Although the title was for the PSP, the team did not want to hold back despite hardware limitations, recording a quantity of tracks unusual for a spin-off \"Final Fantasy\" title. Wherever possible, the recording was done live. The orchestral and choral elements were performed by the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and the Cantillation chamber choir, and the recording and mixing of these tracks was done at the Sydney Opera House. Recording for other tracks was done at Ishimoto's studio in Japan. After recording, Ishimoto combined the orchestral and choral elements, and rearranged the main leitmotifs to create more variety in the score. Arrangements for the orchestral tunes were done by Kentaro Sato, while arrangements for other tracks were done by Rieko Mikoshiba.\n\nThe game's theme song, \"Zero\", was composed and performed by Japanese rock band Bump of Chicken. The band, which was a big fan of the \"Final Fantasy\" series, was contacted by Square Enix to compose and perform the song and agreed readily. It was brought in after the platform move onto the PSP, but while the game was still titled \"Agito XIII\". While looking for inspiration, the band was able to see in-development screenshots of the game, samples of the script, and character illustrations. The band was mostly given a free hand while composing the song. Its one guideline was provided by Tabata, who suggested the theme song for \"Centuries of Picture\", \"Is Paris Burning?\" by Takeshi Kako, as a source of inspiration. Multiple versions of \"Zero\" were composed for use in different areas of the game. At the request of band leader Motoo Fujiwara, Amano's logo artwork was used for the cover of the single's limited edition.\n\n\"Final Fantasy Type-0 Original Soundtrack\" was released on October 26, 2011. The soundtrack was released in a standard edition, as well as a limited edition that could be purchased both separately and with the collector's edition of the game. A promotional album featuring five tracks was sold by Square Enix at their booth at the Odaiba Expo 2011. The album stayed on the Oricon charts for seven weeks, reaching a high of #25. The soundtrack has received positive reviews in the west from dedicated music outlets \"Original Sound Version\" and \"Game-OST\", with the sites giving both individual tracks and the work in general high praise. \"Zero\" was released on October 19, 2011. It was released as a single instead of being part of the main soundtrack, receiving both a limited and standard edition. The single remained in the Oricon charts for thirty-two weeks, peaking at #2.\n\n\"Type-0\" was released on October 27, 2011, receiving both physical and digital releases. It was initially announced for release in summer of that year, but unspecified difficulties with development including the stoppage of PlayStation Network caused a delay. It was then announced for released on October 13, but was delayed by two weeks. While Square Enix stated it wanted to improve its quality, no other information was given. It was speculated to be due to complaints surrounding the camera control and other gameplay elements. The releases of the soundtrack and the theme song were also delayed. \"Type-0\" was one of a few releases for the PSP to be released on two UMDs, as Tabata wanted to cut as little content as possible, which would have been impossible if they had settled for using one UMD. A demo for the original game was released in August 2011, featuring seven playable characters and four missions at locked difficulty levels. Save data could be transferred to the full game, unlocking special costumes and items and keeping experience points. A second demo was released on November 22, a month after the full game's release. It replaced the original demo and gave players access to exclusive items and costumes. A collector's edition was released exclusively through Square Enix's online store, containing artwork, a limited edition version of the soundtrack, postcards and a booklet of character introductions. The title was later added to their Ultimate Hits budget title collection.\n\n\"Type-0\" has never received an official localization in its original form. During development, while it was still titled \"Agito XIII\", Tabata said he was trying to make the game appealing to North American players. Despite a localization being confirmed as in development in an official guidebook interview, the original version of \"Type-0\" was not released in the west. In the wake of the game's release in Japan, 1UP.com and Joystiq speculated that the game could be successfully brought west as a port to the PlayStation Vita. Tabata later commented that the main reasons for the game not being localized were the flagging Western PSP market and uncertainties surrounding the Vita's commercial success.\n\nAn unofficial fan translation patch was announced in mid-2012. Work on the fan translation took place over the following two years, during which time Square Enix was noncommittal concerning an official Western release. The patch was initially announced for an August 2014 release, but was instead was released on June 9, 2014. According to the translation team leader, the patch was downloaded 100,000 times in the first four days. It was taken down in July of the same year after Square Enix allegedly threatened unspecified legal action, originally thought to be a cease-and-desist order. Later statements revealed that the patch was released earlier than originally announced due to the lead translator on the project wanting fans to see their achievements, which ended up causing a rift between him and the rest of the team. Before the release, Square Enix and the translation team had been in friendly communication concerning the translation. The formal requests to take the patch down were made in the weeks following its release, shortly before the announcement of \"Type-0 HD\". Work on the patch was eventually resumed and a second version, which included unofficial compatibility with the PlayStation 3 system and further translation bugfixes, was eventually released in 2015.\n\nMultiple pieces of merchandise were created for the game. An \"Ultimania\", part of a series of dedicated guidebooks, was released in the same month as the original game. It contained story and character breakdowns, concept art, and interviews with developers. A different book, was also released in October. It featured character biographies, details on the world of Orience, and interviews with the voice actors for Class Zero. The following year, a dedicated art book was released containing artwork of the game's characters and monsters, and an interview with Tabata. Characters from the game, including Ace, Machina and other members of Class Zero, appeared in the fourth series of releases for the \"Final Fantasy Trading Card Game\". In November 2011, a manga adaptation of \"Type-0\", illustrated by Takatoshi Shiozawa, began serialization in \"Young Gangan\" magazine. The manga has been collected into a tankōbon volume and was released on April 21, 2012. Another manga titled also illustrated by Shiozawa, began publication in \"Young Gangan\" in April 2012. It ended in January 2014, with a bonus chapter being published in February of that year, and was later released in five compiled volumes. Yen Press began distribution of the manga in the west in July 2015. Square Enix released two novel adaptations, in April and June 2012, depicting an alternate version of \"Type-0\"s story: and The novels were written by Sōki Tsukishima.\n\nIn the first week on sale, \"Final Fantasy Type-0\" sold 472,253 units, topping Japanese sales charts and selling through 79.08% of its initial shipments. As of January 16, 2012, the game had sold 746,203 copies in Japan. It was the best-selling game of 2011 for Japanese media retail shop Tsutaya, beating \"Monster Hunter Portable 3rd\" (PlayStation Portable) and \"Final Fantasy XIII-2\" (PlayStation 3). It was also the store's best-selling PSP title of the year, followed by \"Monster Hunter Portable 3rd\" and \"Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy\".\n\n\"Famitsu\" and \"Dengeki PlayStation\" both praised the story, with \"Famitsu\" saying it \"vividly portrays the fact that this is a deep, intense \"Final Fantasy\" experience, something beyond just a side story\". Gaming website PlayStation LifeStyle's Heath Hindman was impressed by the darker presentation, calling it \"powerful and well done throughout\", and was impressed with the characters despite some awkward introductory scenes. Erren Van Duine, writing for RPG Site, said that fans would appreciate the scale of the narrative, and praised the handling of the \"Fabula Nova Crystallis\" mythos. She did note that some plot points seemed only included for the sake of convenience, and that the ending forced a second playthrough to see the whole story.\n\n\"Famitsu\" called the original version's gameplay a \"stressless experience\", praising the game's size and saying the action-oriented battle system made it \"a very different \"Final Fantasy\"\". \"Dengeki PlayStation\" similarly praised its size and the tense combat, though the review found aspects of the navigation less appealing. Hindman was generally positive about most aspects of gameplay and the high replay value, but found faults with the scripted opening of the overworld and the real-time strategy segments. Van Duine said the gameplay encouraged immersion and was harsh on novices; she praised several aspects of gameplay, but described the leveling system as \"tricky\". The multiplayer functions were universally praised in Japan. Opinions were divided on the original camera, with \"Famitsu\" praising its movement, while Van Duine and \"Dengeki PlayStation\" found issues with it getting stuck in the environment or impeding visibility. The character AI also received criticism for being unresponsive or wayward.\n\n\"Type-0\" affected several other works in multiple ways. During its development, several staff members and voice actors who had worked on \"Final Fantasy X\" reunited. Their meeting triggered the development of \"Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster\". In the September 2013 issue of \"Famitsu Weekly\", Square Enix revealed \"Final Fantasy Agito\", an online companion game to \"Type-0\" for iOS and Android mobile devices. The game was released in May 2014, and a localization was announced alongside that of \"Type-0\". Its servers were closed down in November 2015, with its localization being cancelled as a result. A new online game set in the \"Type-0\" universe, \"Final Fantasy Awakening\", released in Asian and English-speaking territories between 2016 and 2018.\n\nWhile working on \"Final Fantasy XV\", Tabata decided to make a high-definition remaster of \"Type-0\" for eighth-generation consoles. Developed by Square Enix and HexaDrive, \"Final Fantasy Type-0 HD\" was originally announced at E3 2014, and released worldwide in March 2015. After \"Type-0\"s release, Tabata stated in an interview that he wished to explore the distant history of Orience after the events of the game. Trademarks for \"Type-1\", \"Type-2\" and \"Type-3\" were registered shortly after the \"Type-0\" trademark, but it was suggested that they were simply a protective measure. During interviews given in 2014, Tabata commented that he wished to work on \"Type-1\" after completing \"XV\", and later explained the conceptual \"Type\" series as a means of publishing \"Final Fantasy\" games too experimental for the main series. He hoped to continue with the \"Type\" series if \"Type-0 HD\" was commercially successful.\n\n"}

{"id": "58935560", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58935560", "title": "Growing Participator Approach", "text": "Growing Participator Approach\n\nThe Growing Participator Approach (GPA) is an alternative paradigm for second language acquisition created by Greg Thomson. In GPA, the goal is not language acquisition, but participation in the life of a new community, which is constantly growing over time. Thus, GPA uses the terminology of a 'growing participator' instead of a language learner, and a 'nurturer' instead of a teacher. Theoretically, GPA draws upon James Wersch's sociocultural theory and concepts of mediated learning, along with Lev Vygotsky's zone of proximal development. In the language of pedagogy, GPA involves an approach, a method, and techniques.\n\nThomson suggests three dimensions of language learning (or participation) which are important for GPA.\n\nGPA views language as inseparable from the culture which supports it and the people who live in that culture and their relationships. This sociocultural dimension is fundamental. Thus, instead of learning language in isolation, the goal is to learn a new way of life (languaculture). Hence, GPA uses the terminology of \"growing participators\" rather than \"language learners\". The goal of a growing participator is to learn and grow into a new \"languacultural world\". This happens most effectively when a learner is operating within their growth zone (ZPD). \n\nDrawing on fields of psycholinguistics, and noting that good comprehension of English speech requires a listening vocabulary of over 10,000 words, GPA emphasizes \"massive comprehension vocabulary.\" However, instead of rote memorisation, GPA advocates for continual exposure, \"encountering a massive amount of understandable speech over a long period of time\", in order to slowly internalize vocabulary without trying to memorise one by one. Thus, GPA emphasises comprehension and listening far ahead of speech in the host language.\n\nAll language programs emphasize time, but in GPA the focus is not on quantity of time, but on quality. GPA aims for at least 15 hours/week during which \"people interact with me in my growth zone in their languacultural world.\" As a result, because a beginning learner's growth zone is that of a child, in order for GPA to be put into practice a dedicated native speaker must be hired in the early stages.\n\nBased on these three dimensions, GPA's approach can be summarised as follows:\nThe \"Six-Phase Program\" (SPP), created by Thomson, is \"an idealised program to guide a growing participator into deep involvement with a community.\" It involves 1,500 hours of special-growth activities, assisted (initially) by a dedicated native speaker - who does not need to be a teacher. It is \"structured in such a way that the activities become increasingly advanced as the user grows, and the activities are \"keyed to the sociocultural/human-relationship changes and cognitive changes that the growing participator (GP) undergoes.\"\n\nGPA and the SPP utilise a wide array of techniques, such as TPR activities (in silence for the first 30-40 hrs), back and forth storytelling, wordless picture books, discussing speech acts with the use of resources such as Lexicarry, input/output flooding, ethnographic interviews, and extensive recording and playback for revision.\n"}

In his mature works, he employed linguistic blending in the search for meaningful and archetypal relations between distant cultures.\nHis works and translations have been published by international magazines (as \"Words Without Borders\", \"Swans Commentary\", and \"Ars Interpres\"). On his blending experiments, he uses also Japanese, Sanskrit, Sheng and languages of ethnic groups in Kenya.\n\nOn the way of Jorge Luis Borges, Ezra Pound's \"Cantos\" and T. S. Eliot's \"The Waste Land\", Monte thinks that \"…if we admit that some archetypal ideas are common among our planet inhabitants, then we can state, in the sense meant by Borges, that just one \"Book\" has been written, as an evidence of the original and permanent cultural unity of the world and it contains all the chaotic fragments ever thought and written by people searching for the deep truth of things…\".\nDifferent languages can be approached and mixed \"to transmit something that apparently is far in space and time\" (on what was defined as \"a meta-communicative way\"). On this thinking, a \"blending\" author can \"compose\" poems and works without using his own verses, but only other poets' lines (and sometimes this is Monte's peculiarity), remembering every time, in the beginning, the names of the authors. On another experiment, in fact, Monte puts together, in a common archetypal idea, lines of Virgil, Dante and Blake.\nIf Monte translates, for instance, the first verses of Genesis or any other holy texts in two or three languages, \"…we realize that the new and different sounds, irrespective of our linguistic knowledge, suggest new, universal, cosmic vibrations that the original version didn't succeed in transmitting. In any case they reveal the complexity of reading different levels\":\n\"In principio diviserunt Elohim / coelum et terram / and the land was left barren / et les ombres noires / enveloppaient les profondeurs / bade korgolòdei dar ruie / oghionusoh parmisad / et aura divina / super oceani undas\" (\"Genesis\", Words Without Borders, 2004)\n\nAlison Phipps, expert in Intercultural Studies, defines this form of blending as an \"embroidering gossamer\".<br>\nIn his latest experiments, on Swans Commentary, the visual coloured arrangement of verses (one colour for each one of the poem's selected authors) is important in conveying the intended effect of his multilingual works.\n\nThe French writer Orlando de Rudder, thinks that Monte's attempts are the beginning of a new \"\"synthèse\" des langues\", a form of \"Babel Library\" where all the world poets live together, syncretistically, common universal feelings. The Italian writer Claudio Magris thinks that this kind of poetry is definable as \"meticciato organico\" (\"organic blending\").\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "44727979", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44727979", "title": "Indian princess", "text": "Indian princess\n\nAn Indian princess (or Native American princess) is a representation of indigenous women of the Americas. Often, Indian princesses are portrayed as daughters of Tribal chiefs and are depicted as cartoons that conform to unnatural standards of beauty. The most famous and legendized Indian princess is Pocahontas. The phrase \"Indian princess\" is often considered to be a derogatory term and is deemed offensive to Natives.\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, American colonial culture portrayed the Native woman as a symbol of the Americas. For colonists, the Native woman represented mysterious new land and enticing new freedoms, and could dignify the Americas as a potential source of power. As the colonists became more independent, the Native American woman was typecast as the Indian princess. In paintings and engravings, North America was personified by the symbol of the Indian princess, who wore a feathered headdress, gripped a bow and arrow, and was often depicted in pursuit of freedom. Sometimes, the Indian princess was pictured leading troops of American colonists into battle; in later years, she could be seen cloaked in the American flag. The symbol of the Indian princess relied on ideas of freedom, power, wildness, and loyalty to the white man. These themes can be seen in modern media renditions of the Indian princess; for example, in portrayals of Pocahontas, who has been defined by her untamed connection to nature and her alleged rescue of John Smith. Though the image of the grand and liberated Indian princess was commonly used to epitomize America, icons and accounts depicting Native and indigenous women as savages and squaws were still publicized and normalized.\n\nGenerally, Native American and indigenous women of all statuses were in charge of the agricultural sector of tribal life. They cleared fields, planted, and harvested crops, providing most of the food for the tribe. This proximity to nature is reflected and often exaggerated in depictions of Indian princesses in media. The Native woman’s symbolization of American land and agriculture also gave rise to her as a symbol of fertility. Twentieth century poet Hart Crane describes Pocahontas as “'a woman, ripe, waiting to be taken'” by the white man. Native women also played integral roles in the fur trade, acting as interpreters. In some tribes, Native women of higher status were able to participate in council, elect chiefs, and participate in battles.\n\nAs Native American life evolved alongside colonial culture, Native women began to play a larger role in Euro-American life. Recruited by settlers as interpreters, guides, craftspeople, and servants, some Native women assimilated, or were forced to assimilate, into colonial society. Native women of higher rank, such as daughters of chiefs, could also be recruited to marry white settlers. Though it was generally seen as cultural advancement for a Native woman to be accepted into Euro-American society, many of these women were still referred to as squaws, despite their elevation of class. \n\nThe Native woman’s assimilation into colonial society is a key part of many depictions of Indian princesses in media. This is often conveyed through the religious conversion of the Indian princess, portrayals of the Indian princess and white men in close proximity, and illustrations of the Indian princess with a skin tone lighter than other Natives.\n\nThe “Indian Princess” is determined by her relationship with the white man and her behavior that deems her the idealized Indian woman. This observation of Native American women in media, like any, is important because it reveals to the audience the lifestyle of a culture that is generally hidden from the public. The Indian Princess serves to be an important connection between white culture and native culture, specifically the dominance of the former over the latter. The Princess thus serves as a model for assimilation into a more civilized society. She gains this privilege by guiding the white man into her territory. Native female author, Denise K. Lajimodiere, elaborates on this idea of the Indian Princess being an aid to the white man by claiming that Princesses must help non-indians in their conquest against their own people in order to achieve a likeness to their European counterparts. Because of this, the Indian Princess is seen as a sidekick to the white hero. John M. Coward asserts that their relationship is based on a power dynamic that shows the colonizers as heroes to a group of savages because they had helped them transition from barbarism to a refined society. Typically, the Indian Princess serves as a symbol of triumph for white men in colonizing and asserting their power over Native people.\n\nIndian Princesses are considered to be the idealized Indian woman. These woman are commonly depicted with lighter skin and follow other European Beauty standards. Coward claims that Indian women who then follow this standard and show signs of a charming feminine beauty will become the woman men lust after. Their characterization isolates themselves from typical Native American women and portray them as an extension of their white counterparts. This emphasizes the “otherness” of Native American woman who are considered to be a squaw figure if they don’t adopt these beauty regimes. The decision for Native American woman to become an Indian Princess or squaw depends on their relationship with men. Squaws are “uncivilized” Indian woman while Indian Princesses are gentle and loving toward her white hero. The Indian Princess acts as a symbol of the success of these colonizers, the “otherness” of Native Americans is combatted when she acts as a medium between these two cultures. Scholars agree then agree that Indian Princesses in media are portrayed as submissive, idealized supporting figures to the white hero. This sentiment is clearly evident in characters such as Pocahontas and Tiger Lily.\n\nTiger Lily is an Indian princess character from the Piccaninny Tribe in \"Peter and Wendy\" by J. M. Barrie. In the book, she is captured by Captain Hook and Mr. Smee and it is rescued by Peter Pan. She only speaks in a stereotypical dialect with a limited command of the language following her rescue. Her most famous depiction in adaptation is in the 1953 Disney film. Controversy has surrounded the character, as its representation has been touted as racist and sexist. Tiger Lily is depicted as both a sexualized figure and a strong warrior in Peter Pan. In an early version of the manuscript, Tiger Lily plays out a rape fantasy by asking Peter Pan what would happen if he attacked her in the woods to which the other Indians replied that “she him’s squaw”. The depiction of Tiger Lily stands in stark contrast to the female figure of Wendy. While many of the female characters appear to desire the affections of Peter Pan, Wendy, the older sister in the Darling family, is presented as a pure, motherly, and talkative figure, often associated with the color white. Conversely, Tiger Lily is depicted as both ethnic and quiet, but not embodying the stereotypical role of a woman. Although Peter Pan saves both Wendy and Tiger Lily in the story, Tiger Lily promises to protect him from the threat of pirates in return. Tiger Lily is brave in the face of fear and possesses important knowledge of the forest. \n\nThe Disney character Pocahontas, eponymous star of the 1995 Disney film is the most famous modern representation of an Indian princess. She has been inducted to the ranks of the Disney Princess franchise. Critical reception of her character has panned her overly sexualized portrayal. Her appearance was modeled on a number of sources, including Eskimo-French Canadian/Cree actress Irene Bedard, who provided the character's speaking voice, Powhatan historian Shirley Little Dove Custolow, and her sister Debbie White Dove, Christy Turlington, who is of Caucasian descent, and Dyna Taylor, a then-21-year-old senior at the California Institute of the Arts, who was used as the model for the character's face. Taylor, who is of Filipino descent, was paid about $200 for four modeling sessions, saying, \"I work across from a Disney Store. When they show the promos, certain expressions are really familiar.\" The fictional Pocahontas is portrayed as being different from the rest of her Powhatan tribe, particularly as it relates to her relationship with John Smith, the European character she falls in love with in 1607. Unlike her violent and unfriendly tribe, Pocahontas is gentle and loving. She represents the “noble savage” in her willingness to defy the stereotypical traits assigned to indigenous people, instead embracing traits of the colonists, specifically her adventurous spirit which allows her to turn her back on her past and embrace new opportunities.\n\nDressing up as Indian costumes is a term referred to as ‘Playing Indian’. 'Playing Indian’ is an American practice that goes back to colonial times. During The Boston Tea Party, colonists were dressed up as Indians, as they threw the English’s tea of the ship and into the harbour. The colonists wore feathers, blankets and drew black soot on their faces to portray themselves as Native Americans.\n\nThe ‘Indian princess’ is often used as a form of dress-up, costume or a form of ‘playing Indian’. Many non-indigenous people believe that dressing up as and Indian princess’ is innocent, inoffensive and harmless. The cultural appropriation of native traditional dress as a costume is often viewed as offensive because it ignores the traditional Native-American regalia as significant and regularly sexualizes Native American women.\n\nAccording to authors, Kisban Lara-Cooper and Sammy Cooper, Society’s idea of the image of an Indian princess exists only historically. Therefore Indian princess costumes represent historical figures and representations. The costumes are not Indian princesses living and existing in today’s society. This is because today’s populations of Indian-Americans lack relations with the rest of America. 57% of Native Americans live off reserves, while 34% do live on Indian reserves, being the smallest population of any other racial groups. \n\nSarah Winnemucca, a Northern Paiute educator, translator, author, and activist, is a well known performer who acted as an Indian princess. She played many roles in the late 1800s after she came to northeastern United States in 1883. She had previously spent more than 13 years negotiating with the press on presentations of herself and American Indians in newspaper media. It is debated on whether she is considered a positive figure for the Indian princess stereotype as her actions are contested by scholars as conforming to Euro-American standards. \n\nShe often referred to herself as a “princess” and dressed the part despite the fact that her familial status did not uphold that power, nor was it recognized as part of the structure of her tribe’s leadership. Sorisio argues that by using the English term “princess” to refer to herself, she claimed power that the press was able to attribute to her and the Paiute nation. Her role as a princess served to “legitimize in non-Native discourse Northern Paiutes’ political identity”. Scholar, Rayna Green, argues that this persona feeds into colonial desires for Native Americans to be a “helpmate”. The question of her legitimacy is further contested in her costuming. \n\nScholars argue that the inaccuracies within the costuming that Winnemucca models suggests compliance with the non-Native desires of an Indian princess. Joanna Cohan Scherer, argues that Winnemucca exhibits a \"Pocahontas complex”  as she dresses in clothing that is not representative of a Paiute woman. She dresses in cloth rather than buckskin and in “elaborate nontraditional costumes”. Some critic her actions as a form of complacency in colonialism. Even so, some scholars see her actions as a means of working through the system to achieve societal presence. Linda Bolton argues that the persona that Winnemucca presents acts as a bridge to help non-natives see Native Americans. She states that even by wearing the inauthentic clothing, she presents an irony of the Indian identity. She states that there is an “authentic Indian self, the vanishing American” that is difficult to translate into Euro-American culture. Media represents the Native American culture as an “unknowable other”, so the irony of a real Native American in inauthentic clothing reveal the absence of the real individuals that exist, in media. According to Bolton, the “unknowable other” is made “present” by Winnemucca. Winnemucca even references the issue of costuming in her lectures. She states that the lack of materials needed to recreate the clothing is understood by the audience because it is a performance. As an Indian princess, she uses the performances to reflect presentations of herself and Native Americans regardless. \n\nIndian princess pageants have taken the stereotype and used it as a form of empowerment for young indigenous women. Contrary to typical beauty pageants that judge based on physical appearance, indigenous women who compete in Indian princess pageants are judged on how well they promote traditional values and represent their community and not on how they look.\n\nIn 1940 Ella Deloria, a Yankton Sioux scholar, produced a pageant named \"The Life Story of a People\" for the Native Americans of Robeson Country and surrounding areas . It was part of a morale and community-building effort that is also now recognized by American Indian scholars as an important effort toward accurate representation of Native Americans in theatre . It was supported by the Dakota Indian Foundation and had since become a tradition . Lumbee Indians, the ninth largest tribe in the United States, has referenced the pageants done by Deloria within their historical narrative, demonstrating the pageants’ “contribut[ion] to the persistence and revitalization of […] Indian identity through narrative and performance” . Deloria’s pageantry began with the assimilation and accommodation of Euramerican institutions, but later developed into an exploration of “Indian identities under siege” where Native American people performed themselves and acted out their stories in her pageants. According to David Glassberg, pageantry characteristically has a “theme of […] keeping pace with modernity [and] retaining a particular version of their traditions”, an effort that Native American pageantry has since been able to accomplish. According to Deloria, the purpose of her pageants were to “reclaim, with pride, the cultural resources of the past” through theatre. American Indian scholars agree that pageantry was able to reclaim the historical tellings of history that had thus been juxtaposed by media’s representation of the past.  \n\nFeminist writers like Wendy Kozol make note of beauty pageant winners who exemplify Native American tradition within the Euro-American cultural context. According to Kozol, Viola Noah a runner-up for the Choctaw Princess award in the1973 Labor Day gathering stepped away from the typical photo rendering of Native American princesses . Previous winners were typically shown with traditional Native American attire in natural settings for an ‘“authentic”’ rendering of Native Americans . This, however, is interpreted by feminist writers like Kozol as more of a suggestion that Native Americans are “living relics of the past” (Kozol 70) because it suggests a society that has been untouched by time or colonization. Kozol calls the photo of Noah a “competing form […] of affiliation” because she wears traditional attire with modern American elements within the photo. She explains that Native tribes have often used pageants and parades as cultural practices to keep tradition alive. \n\nThe Miss Indian World contest began in 1984. The contest is held each year during the Gathering of Nations pow wow in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The contest is the largest and most prestigious of its kind.\n\nRequirements for participation\n\nJudgement criteria\n\nWinners\n\nThe Calgary Stampede Indian Princess contest began in 1964. The Calgary Stampede Indian Princess joins the Calgary Stampede Rodeo Queen and Princesses to complete the Calgary Stampede Rodeo Royalty. While the Calgary Stampede Indian Princess is considered part of the Calgary Stampede Royalty, she has a separate category and competition of her own.\n\nEvelyn Locker (née Eagle Speaker) of the Kainai Nation was the first First Nations woman to participate in and be crowned as Calgary Stampede royalty in 1954. Controversy erupted after Evelyn Eagle Speaker’s crowning because she was of Aboriginal descent. The issues surrounding her crowning focused on how she should represent the Calgary Stampede and perform her role as Queen, specifically what kind of clothing she should wear (her traditional regalia or cowgirl gear). Most of the time the Calgary press referred to her as the Indian Princess instead of her rightful title as Rodeo Queen.\n\nRequirements for participation:\n\nJudgement criteria:\n\nWinners\n"}

They are characterized as being animistic, and have been collectively referred to as Anitism or Bathalism or the more modern and less Tagalog-centric Dayawism.\n\nThe profusion of different terms arises from the fact that these indigenous religions mostly flourished in the pre-colonial period before the Philippines had become a single nation. The various peoples of the Philippines spoke different languages and thus used different terms to describe their religious beliefs. While these beliefs can be treated as separate religions, scholars have noted that they follow a \"common structural framework of ideas\" which can be studied together.\n\nSome writers have noted that these beliefs have similarities with the Shinto religion of Japan, although they do not draw a historical linkage between the two belief systems. More historically linked are the various indigenous religious beliefs the various religions of Oceania and the maritime Southeast Asia, which draw their roots from Austronesian beliefs as those in the Philippines.\n\nAs of 2010, an estimated 2% of the Philippine population identified as practicing indigenous beliefs - the majority of whom live in isolated areas where Islam, Catholicism, or Protestantism have not become dominant. Since the entrance of the 21st century, streams of Christian and Muslim Filipinos are steadily reverting to their indigenous ethnic religions that were once branded as lowly by Spanish, American, and Arabians colonizers, but have been affirmed by the social sciences as comprehensive and highly in nature.\n\nOn the other hand, many aspects of these traditions have been integrated into the local practice of Catholicism and Islam, resulting in syncretistic practices called \"Folk Catholicism\" and \"Folk Islam\".\n\nThe folklore narratives associated with these religious beliefs constitute what is now called Philippine mythology, and is an important aspect of the study of Philippine culture and Filipino psychology.\n\nHistorian T. Valentino Sitoy, in his review of documents concerning pre-Spanish religious beliefs, notes that three core characteristics which shaped the religious worldview of Filipinos throughout the archipelago before the arrival of Spanish colonizers. First, Filipinos believed in the existence of parallel spirit world, which was invisible but had an influence on the visible world. Second, Filipinos believed that there were spirits (\"anito\") everywhere - ranging from the high creator gods to minor spirits that lived in the environment such as trees or rocks or creeks. Third, Filipinos believed that events in the human world were influenced by the actions and interventions of these spirit beings.\n\n\"Anito\" were the ancestor spirits (\"umalagad\"), or nature spirits and deities (\"diwata\") in the indigenous animistic religions of precolonial Philippines. \"Paganito\" (also \"maganito\" or \"anitohan\") refers to a séance, often accompanied by other rituals or celebrations, in which a shaman (Visayan: \"babaylan\", Tagalog: \"katalonan\") acts as a medium to communicate directly with the spirits. When a nature spirit or deity is specifically involved, the ritual is called \"pagdiwata\" (also \"magdiwata\" or \"diwatahan\"). \"Anito\" can also refer to the act of worship or a religious sacrifice to a spirit.\n\nWhen Spanish missionaries arrived in the Philippines, the word \"anito\" came to be associated with the physical representations of spirits that featured prominently in \"paganito\" rituals. During the American rule of the Philippines (1898–1946), the meaning of the Spanish word \"idolo\" (\"a thing worshiped\") has been further conflated with the English word \"idol\", and thus \"anito\" has come to refer almost exclusively to the carved figures or statues (\"taotao\") of ancestral and nature spirits.\n\nThe belief in \"anito\" is sometimes referred to as anitism in scholarly literature (Spanish: \"anitismo\" or \"anitería\").\n\nMany indigenous Filipino cultures assert the existence of a high god, creator god, or sky god. Among the Tagalogs, the supreme god was known as Bathala, who was additionally described as Maykapal (the all-powerful) or Lumikha (the creator). Among the Visayan peoples the creator God is referred to as Laon, meaning \"the ancient one.\" Among the Manuvu, the highest god was called Manama. Among most of the Cordilleran peoples (with the Apayao region as an exception), the creator and supreme teacher is known as Kabuniyan.\n\nIn most cases, however, these gods were considered such great beings that they were too distant for ordinary people to approach. People thus tended to pay more attention to \"lesser gods\" or \"assistant deities\" who could more easily approached, and whose wills could more easily be influenced.\n\nLesser deities in Filipino religions generally fit into three broad categories: nature spirits residing in the environment, such as a mountain or a tree; guardian spirits in charge of specific aspects of daily life such as hunting or fishing; and deified ancestors or tribal heroes. These categories frequently overlap, with individual deities falling into two or more categories, and in some instances, deities evolve from one role to another, as when a tribal hero known for fishing becomes a guardian spirit associated with hunting.\n\nDuring the pre-Hispanic period, \"babaylan\", functioned as shamans and spiritual leaders and \"mananambal\" were for folk healers. At the onset of the Colonial era, the suppression of the \"babaylans\" and the native Filipino religion gave rise to the \"albularyo\". By exchanging the native prayers and spells with Catholic \"oraciones\" and Christian prayers, the albularyo was able to synchronize the ancient mode of healing with the new religion.\n\n\"Albularyos\" employ herbs, alum, coconut oil, etc., in their healing practices as well as various prayers, chants and \"supernatural\" cures—especially for cases involving supernatural causes. As time progressed, the \"albularyo\" became more prominent in rural areas in the Philippines. Lacking access to scientific medical practices, rural Filipinos trusted the \"albularyos\" to rid them of common (and sometimes believed to be supernatural) sicknesses and diseases.\n\nHowever, the role of the \"albularyo\" was slowly overshadowed by the rise of modern medical facilities. Urbanization gave the masses access to more scientific treatments, exchanging the chants and herbs of the \"albularyos\" with the newer technologies offered by the medical field. Still, \"albularyos\" flourish in many rural areas in the Philippines where medical facilities are still expensive and sometimes inaccessible.\n\nSome of the rituals observed by Filipino Folk Healers include:\n\n\n"}

These decisions can occur at any time, even while the player is going through inventory in the menu.\n\nThe player controls the main character, Capell, from a third-person perspective while three other characters are controlled by AI. The player fights battles with this team of four, or sometimes with multiple teams formed from a possible 18 characters. In battle, Capell has the ability to use connect actions, which give him access to other team members' skills.\n\nThe game was originally meant to transition between day and night every 10 minutes, giving the player different opportunities; for instance, stealth would be easier at night. However, this system was later removed. Director Hiroshi Ogawa explained that other forms of stealth remained in the game: “As an example, when you’re running away from a hunting dog, you can distract him by dropping apples from the trees. However, the guards may catch you when they hear the thud of the apples.”\n\n\"Infinite Undiscovery\" was announced in September 2006 by \"Famitsu\". Initially it was believed that Microsoft would publish the game, but at TGS 2007, Hajime Kojima and Hiroshi Ogawa stated that Square Enix would take over publishing duties because they have more \"know-how\" with RPGs. However, since Microsoft was the original publisher, it holds the trademark for the game and shares the copyright with Square Enix.\n\nAccording to tri-Ace co-founder and R&D programmer Yoshiharu Gotanda, the game is set to contain 10 years' worth of ideas that can finally be realized with the Xbox 360, and with it, role-playing video games \"will undergo a true evolution.\" Tri-Ace wished to achieve this by putting the player through \"situational battles\" that would lead to \"unknown discoveries\" and cause permanent changes to the world.\n\nThe game was directed by Hiroshi Ogawa and produced by Hajime Kojima, both of whom are also credited in the tri-Ace titles \"\" and \"\". Tri-Ace president Yoshiharu Gotanda signed on as the game's lead programmer. Scenario was handled by ORG Ltd., including Ryo Mizuno and Shoji Gatoh. The game's characters were designed by Yukihiro Kajimoto.\n\nThe English dub was the first title released from New Generation Pictures's Shanghai Studios. As such it features voice actors from Texas and Los Angeles, as well as a large helping of new talent from Shanghai.\n\nBy September 30, 2008, \"Infinite Undiscovery\" had shipped 120,000 copies in Japan, 200,000 copies in North America, and 90,000 copies in Europe. The game also sold 96,000 copies by its third week. \"Famitsu\" gave it a total score of 32 out of 40 from four reviewers (9, 8, 8, 7).\n\nInternationally, the game received \"average\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. IGN said, \"This isn't a game marred with horrendous bugs or unplayable combat. And it's not boring. It's just misguided. The story is intriguing enough that RPG fanatics should at least give this a rental.\" \"1UP.com\" said, \"\"Undiscovery\" is absolutely worth playing through at least once, with the regrettable caveat that it really could've been \"so\" much more.\" \"GamePro\" said, \"In the end, \"Undiscovery\" isn't a bad game but it is seriously flawed. I'd recommend renting it before you invest your hard earned cash on a purchase, especially if you're new to the RPG genre.\" GameSpot felt that the game was too flawed to reach its potential.\n\n\n \n"}

{"id": "386916", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=386916", "title": "Inuksuk", "text": "Inuksuk\n\nAn inuksuk (plural inuksuit) (from the , plural ; alternatively ' in Inuinnaqtun, ' in Iñupiaq, in Greenlandic, and sometimes inukshuk in English) is a manmade stone landmark or cairn used by the Inuit, Iñupiat, Kalaallit, Yupik, and other peoples of the Arctic region of North America. These structures are found in northern Canada, Greenland, and Alaska (United States). This combined region, above the Arctic Circle, is dominated by the tundra biome and has areas with few natural landmarks.\n\nThe inuksuk may have been used for navigation, as a point of reference, a marker for travel routes, fishing places, camps, hunting grounds, places of veneration, drift fences used in hunting, or to mark a food cache. The Iñupiat in northern Alaska used inuksuit to assist in the herding of caribou into contained areas for slaughter. Varying in shape and size, the inuksuit have ancient roots in Inuit culture.\n\nHistorically, the most common types of inuksuk are built with stone placed upon stone, and the simplest type of which is a single stone positioned in an upright manner. There is some debate as to whether the appearance of human- or cross-shaped cairns developed in the Inuit culture before the arrival of European missionaries and explorers. The size of some inuksuit suggest that the construction was often a communal effort.\n\nAt Inuksuk Point (Enukso Point) on Baffin Island, there are over 100 inuksuit. The site was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1969.\nThe word means \"that which acts in the capacity of a human.\" The word comes from the morphemes (\"person\") and (\"ersatz, substitute\"). It is pronounced in Nunavik and the southern part of Baffin Island (see Inuit phonology for the linguistic reasons). In many of the central Nunavut dialects, it has the etymologically related name (plural: ).\n\nWhile the predominant English spelling is , both the Government of Nunavut and the Government of Canada through Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada promote the Inuit-preferred spelling .\n\nA structure similar to an inuksuk is called an (, \"imitation of a person\", plural ); it is meant to represent a human figure. has become widely familiar to non-Inuit, and particularly found in Greenland. However, it is not the most common type of inuksuk. It is distinguished from inuksuit in general.\n\nThe Hammer of Thor, located on the Ungava Peninsula, Quebec may be an inuksuk.\n\nInuksuit continue to serve as an Inuit cultural symbol. An inuksuk is the centrepiece of the flag and coat of arms of the Canadian territory of Nunavut, and the flag of Nunatsiavut. The Inuksuk High School in Iqaluit is named after the landmark.\n\nInuksuitparticularly, but not exclusively, of the \"inunnguaq\" varietyare also increasingly serving as a mainstream Canadian national symbol. In 1999, Inukshuk was the name for the International Arctic Art & Music Project of ARBOS in the Canadian provinces of Quebec, Ontario, Nunavik, and Nunavut; and in Greenland, Austria, Denmark and Norway.\n\nOn July 13, 2005, Canadian military personnel erected an inuksuk on Hans Island, along with a plaque and a Canadian flag, as part of Canada's longstanding dispute with Denmark over the small Arctic island. The markers have been erected throughout the country, including a inuksuk that stands in Toronto on the shores of Lake Ontario. Located in Battery Park, it commemorates the World Youth Day 2002 festival that was held in the city in July 2002.\n\nAn \"inunnguaq\" is the basis of the logo of the 2010 Winter Olympics designed by Vancouver artist Elena Rivera MacGregor. Its use in this context has been controversial among the Inuit, and the First Nations within British Columbia. Although the design has been questioned, people believe it pays tribute to Alvin Kanak's 1986 inuksuk at English Bay. Friendship and the welcoming of the world are the meanings of both the English Bay structure and the 2010 Winter Olympics emblem.\n\nThe Vancouver 2010 logo and the construction of inuksuit around the world have led to increasing recognition of them. There are five authentic inuksuit which were donatedwholly or in partby the government of Canada: in Brisbane, Australia; Monterrey, Mexico; Oslo, Norway; Washington, D.C., United States; and Guatemala City.\n\nThe most recent Canadian-donated inuksuk was built in Monterrey, Mexico, in October 2007 by the Inuvialuit artist Bill Nasogaluak. The sculpture was presented to the people of the northern state of Nuevo León as a gift from the Monterrey chapter of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in Mexico and the Government of Canada, to mark the chamber's 10th anniversary in the city. The sculpture stands over the Santa Lucía Riverwalk. Nasogaluak, of Tuktoyaktuk, personally chose the rocks for the structure from a local quarry near Monterrey. The inuksuk contains two rocks which the artist took to Mexico from Canada, one from the high Arctic and another from his home town of Toronto. Together they form the inuksuk's heart.\n\nThe inuksuk was also used as the symbol of the Summit of the Americas, because of its connotations of \"guidance and unity...towards common goals.\"\n\nOfficials in various wilderness parks throughout Canada routinely dismantle inuksuit constructed by hikers and campers, for fear that they could misdirect park visitors from the cairns and other markers that indicate hiking trails. The practice of erecting inuksuit in parks has become so widespread that Killarney Provincial Park, on the north shore of Ontario's Georgian Bay, issued a notice in 2007 urging visitors to \"stop the invasion\" of inuksuit.\n\nA large number of inuksuit have been built in some areas along the Trans-Canada Highway, including Northern Ontario. In 2010, a journalist from Sudbury's \"Northern Life\" counted 93 inuksuit along Highway 69 between Sudbury and Parry Sound. The journalist successfully tracked down a person who had built two inuksuit along the route; he attributed his action to having had a \"fill the dreams moment where I needed to stop and do it\" while driving home from a family funeral.\n\nAccording to \"Guinness World Records\", the tallest inuksuk is in Schomberg, Ontario, Canada. Built in 2007, it is tall.\n\nThe Canadian rock band Rush featured a lone inuksuk on the cover of their 1996 album \"Test for Echo\".\n\nOn the occasion of the 20th Anniversary of the Rome Statute and to mark Canada’s support for the International Criminal Court (ICC) and as a symbol for its commitment to reconciliation with Canada’s First Nations, Canadian Minister of Justice and Attorney General Wilson-Raybould on 7 March 2018 handed over an Inukshuk as a gift to the ICC, which was revealed by her and ICC President Judge Silvia Fernández de Gurmendi at its premises in The Hague.\n\n\n"}

If a Regret comes into contact with the player, it is game over. Regrets take several roles in the game, from standing guard at stationary posts to actively chasing (or attempting to scare) the player. In some situations, the cursed game provides clues for bypassing Regrets in a given situation.\n\nAn urban legend has been circulating about a nameless, cursed role-playing video game for the fictional Twin Screen (TS) handheld game system. According to the rumor, anyone who plays this and does not complete it within seven days will die.\n\nThe player assumes the role of a college student at Nanto University, Tokyo. The player has started playing the cursed game, sent to them by classmate , who has been absent recently. , Odaka's girlfriend requests that the player go to Odaka's apartment. The player obliges, but makes a horrific discovery: Odaka has mysteriously died of drowning, with his TS system in his hands. The player also discovers that Odaka hadn't sent the game to the player, as he was trying to stop it from \"spreading and killing others\". The next day, a distressed Riko dies on the Nanto Express subway, having received the cursed game six days before the protagonist.\n\nOn the player's third day, Nanto University professor calls the player to his office. An IT expert on digital information with an interest in folklore, Ooyama confirms that a \"killer curse\" is a very real possibility, and sees the nameless game as an opportunity to conduct research on its mysteries. He first directs the player to investigate , the abandoned location of the cursed game's domain. Partway through, Ooyama has the player look for a medical chart for , a man who died in a similar fashion to Odaka. The player soon discovers that they are being pursued by spirits devoid of eyes or mouth, and discovers Riko as one of them. Riko's \"spirit\" appears after the player obtains Yutani's chart and receives a disturbing game update, and chases them out of the hospital.\n\nOn the fourth day, Professor Ooyama and the player learn that Yutani was the president of a video game company called Uta-Soft, located on the fourth floor of the ; Ooyama directs the player there, warning them to avoid the spirits, which he dubs \"Regrets\", while exploring. Along the way, Ooyama sends the player information on Uta-Soft, including the fact that the company has gone bankrupt, with most of its workers missing and presumed dead. At the abandoned office, the player collects various pieces of information, including a plan for the unnamed game and an employee roster, before escaping the Regrets.\n\nOn the fifth day, Ooyama finds that only one person from Uta-Soft is still alive: , the creative director of the unnamed game. The player travels to the abandoned Ikuta residence, where they find a near-catatonic Ushio in the closet. Almost immediately after, a game update takes the player into a flashback of events inside the house. Yutani, constantly stressed from work and jealous of Ikuta's love for his family, brutally murdered his wife Tomoka while Ikuta was at work. Ikuta's daughter Asahi, who hated video games (as they kept Ikuta from spending time with the family), came home to find an indescribably bloody scene, with Yutani splattered in blood and grinning madly. Luckily, Asahi was able to escape the house before Yutani could catch her as well. After the vision ends, Ikuta utters Asahi's name, and gives the player her picture diary.\n\nOn the sixth day, Ooyama explains to the player that after Tomoka's death, Ikuta continued to work on the cancelled game, angering Asahi into running away from home. From the information in the diary, Ooyama guesses that Asahi may have gone to the capeside ; he directs the player there, telling them he would meet them there later. When the player finds Asahi's body there, she communicates to the player through the game, asking why they came for her despite her attempts to kill them, before vanishing. The player leaves the hotel to meet with Ooyama, but is forced to flee upon making a shocking discovery: Ooyama has been turned into a Regret (most likely from freezing to death). Asahi again communicates to the player, declaring that her actions were to avenge her mother, and that she will never forgive her father, video games, or even the player. Later, a delayed e-mail message from Ooyama asks the player what the drawing in Odaka's apartment stood for. Realizing that it was the located nearby, the player heads there.\n\nOn the seventh and last day, the player arrives at the lighthouse. There, they learn that Asahi is the true source of the game's curse, having committed suicide by jumping from the top of the lighthouse. The player then heads for the nearby cliff (depicted many times in the cursed game) to reach Asahi before daybreak, in 3 minutes. Along the way, they must speak to the now-harmless spirits of the curse, in reverse chronological order, through the cursed game. Ooyama's spirit explains that he became a Regret because he wanted to see what would happen if one received the game, but never played it. Having received the game one day before the player, that makes Ooyama another victim. Ooyama explains that he now understands Ikuta's reason for working on the nameless game: to show that video games can be used to show someone how much they love them. After talking with Riko, Odaka, and the three missing Uta-Soft employees, the player speaks to Yutani, the curse's first victim. Acknowledging that he was the reason the curse began (by murdering Asahi's mother), Yutani tells the player to speak with Asahi and help her realize what she had in terms of family and love.\n\nWhen the player communicates to Asahi, they show her the happy memories that she and her family shared. Suddenly, Tomoka's spirit appears through the game, telling Asahi that she is sad that her daughter had died, and also closed her heart. When Tomoka mentions Ikuta directly, the player finds Ikuta standing next to them in the real world, having been led here by Tomoka's spirit. He explains his good intentions for creating the game, and apologizes to Asahi. In the game, Asahi responds, saying ; and the scene fades to white, before returning to the player, sitting at the cliff and very much alive. Ikuta, who notices the player, asks if they have met before; the player confirms this, before asking how the nameless game ends. Ikuta, taken aback by the player's interest, decides to complete the game's story to make amends to his family. Afterward, the game credits play, revealing the name of the nameless game: \"Road to Sunrise\".\n\nThe game has two different endings, depending on whether the player obtained all of the special items found in the nameless game. If the player obtains every single item, they will unlock the good ending; otherwise, they will receive the bad ending.\n\nThe game's soundtrack was composed by Masayoshi Soken under the pseudonym , a name which in the game refers to the composer for the cursed game's soundtrack.

In mathematical terms, good \"g\" is normal if and only if:\n\nformula_1\n\nIn the above definition, \"Q\" represents the quantity of good \"x\" demanded and \"Y\" represents the income of the given consumer being modeled. Intuitively, a good is normal if a change in the consumer's income causes the same direction change in the consumer's demand for good \"x.\"\n\nThere are two types of normal goods: necessity goods and luxury goods. A normal good is classified as a necessity good when ξ < 1 (i.e. when an \"x\"% change in income causes a change in x \"less than x%\"), whereas a normal good is a luxury good when ξ > 1 (i.e. when an \"x\"% change in income causes a change in x \"greater than x%\"). A good where ξ < 0 is an inferior good.\n\nAccording to economic theory, there must be at least one normal good in any given bundle of goods (i.e. not all goods can be inferior). Economic theory assumes that a good provides always marginal utility (holding everything else equal). Therefore, if consumption of all goods decrease when income increases, the resulting consumption combination would fall short of the new budget constraint frontier. This would violate the economic rationality assumption.\n\nWhen the price of a normal good is zero, the demand is infinite.\n\nA caveat to the table above is that not all goods are strictly normal or inferior across all income levels. For example, average used cars could have a positive income elasticity of demand at low income levels - extra income could be funneled into replacing public transportation with self-commuting. However, the income elasticity of demand of average used cars could turn negative at higher income levels, where the consumer may elect to purchase new and/or luxury cars instead.\n\nAnother potential caveat is brought up by \"The Notion of Inferior Good in the Public Economy\" by Professor Jurion of University of Liège (published 1978). Public goods such as online news are often considered inferior goods. However, the conventional distinction between inferior and normal goods may be blurry for public goods. (At least, for goods that are non-rival enough that they are conventionally understood as \"public goods.\") Consumption of many public goods will decrease when a rational consumer's income rises, due to replacement by private goods, e.g. building a private garden to replace use of public parks. But when effective congestion costs to a consumer rises with the consumer's income, even a normal good with a low income elasticity of demand (independent of the congestion costs associated with the non-excludable nature of the good) will exhibit the same effect. This makes it difficult to distinguish inferior public goods from normal ones.\n\n"}
{"id": "43297766", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43297766", "title": "Northampton Sekhemka statue", "text": "Northampton Sekhemka statue\n\nThe Northampton Sekhemka statue is an Ancient Egyptian artefact, given by the Marquess of Northampton to Northampton Museum, in or about 1870. The statue dates from the 5th dynasty (c. 2494–2345 BC, making it slightly older than Stonehenge) and depicts Sekhemka the scribe with his wife, Sitmerit. It was the subject of a controversial sale in July 2014, that raised questions of the museum's ownership and the ethics of selling artefacts. The statue was sold to an unidentified buyer for £15.76m, which broke the world record for Ancient Egyptian art at auction. On 1 August 2014, Northampton Museums had their accreditation removed by Arts Council England, which ruled that the sale did not meet the accredited standards for museums in managing their collections.\n\nThe statue depicts Sekhemka sitting in a traditional scribal pose and holding on his knees a partly unrolled papyrus which lists various offerings. He is named in an inscription on the plinth of his statue as \"Inspector of Scribes in the House of Largesse, one revered before the Great God\". His wife Sit-Merit is shown sitting at his feet. The limestone statue is tall with the base from front to rear being . Archaeologist Mike Pitts, editor of \"British Archaeology\", took many detailed colour photographs of the statue whilst it was on display in Christie's prior to auction and has published them on his own blog.\n\nThe statue's provenance is unclear. \"Al-Ahram Weekly\" reports that one account describes the statue as being acquired by Northampton Museum in 1849 from the Ottoman sultan, while another version holds that it was acquired by the 2nd Marquess of Northampton during a trip to Egypt, after which his son offered it to Northampton Museum in the 19th century. T. G. H. James noted in 1961 that Northampton Museum held no precise information regarding the acquisition of the statue, but that it was presented to the museum around 1870 by the 3rd Marquess of Northampton and, based on a record from 1899, it is likely to have been acquired by the 2nd Marquess during a trip to Egypt in 1850.\n\nNorthampton Borough Council claimed that they learned the full value of the Sekhemka statue in 2012 during an insurance assessment, and according to \"The Daily Telegraph\" it \"immediately began making plans to cash it in and use the money for other heritage projects in the region.\" The then leader of Northampton Borough Council, David Mackintosh, told the BBC that the statue had \"been in our ownership for over 100 years and it's never really been the centrepiece of our collection\", and that \"We want to expand our museum and to do that we need to raise the money\". The council proposed to use the amount realized through a sale for funding “the restoration of Delapre Abbey, improvements to the museum service and/or other cultural or heritage projects” but the Museum Association asked that proposed sale be halted pending consultation which \"was needed to establish the financially motivated disposal was 'last resort'\"\n\nThe council stated that when the statue was valued in 2010 it was taken off display because of security concerns, and that it would have required 24-hour guarding. However, Axa Art Insurance Ltd subsequently reported that the cabinet display previously used in Northampton Museum was \"adequate\". The council were also asked \"why, when the Friends of Northampton Museum and Art Gallery offered £8,000 to buy a new cabinet, was the offer not taken up?\" but did not reply to this specific question.\n\nIn October 2012, the council published the results of a petition that was signed by 199 (average of all petitions 193 as of July 2014):\n\nNorthampton Borough Council claimed in January 2013 to have sought the views of the public regarding the proposed sale of the statue, but the form this took was criticised by the Museum Associations ethics committee:\n\nNevertheless, the BBC repeated the council's claim that the consultation indicated that of the 173 replies 51% were in favour and 49% were against the sale. No question in the consultation document asked whether the statue should be sold or not; however, those who participated in the consultation could leave optional narrative comments, and the council used these to claim a small majority in favour of selling the statue. The Save Sekhemka Action Group objected to the methods used in the consultation document:\n\nThe Save Sekhemka Action Group reported that their own survey showed \"overwhelming support for protecting the museum's accredited status and keeping the statue\".\n\nThe \"Northampton Chronicle and Echo\" carried out a Facebook poll in June 2014, and found that the majority wanted to keep the statue.\n\nThe present Lord Northampton originally protested at the decision of Northampton Borough Council to sell the statue. However, the BBC reported that, following negotiations lasting a year, he struck a private deal with the council which resulted in him receiving £6 million from the sale. Northampton Borough Council has refused to release details of the legal arrangement. The Marquess had previously been involved with the controversial attempted sale of the Sevso Treasure.\n\nIn June 2014, the council was asked by a local newspaper: \"Are you prepared to show the documents and agreements made with the Marquess of Northampton to any member of the public who asks to see them? If not, why not?\" and replied \"The details of the agreement are confidential between Lord Northampton and the borough council, but we can confirm that 55% of the sale will go to the council and 45% will go to Lord Northampton.\" The council also stated \"The council’s ownership of Sekhemka has been confirmed following advice from lawyers, who are satisfied we have legal right to proceed with the sale. We do not have any deed specifically relating to Sekhemka.\" After the sale of the statue The Save Sekhemka Action Group questioned why the Marquess of Northampton would be receiving over £5 million from the proceeds since, according to Northampton Borough Council, the council owned the statue.\n\nThe Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities asked the Egyptian Embassy in London to take all legal procedures to stop the sale of the statue. Minister Mamdouh Al-Damati condemned the sale as being incompatible with the values and role of museums worldwide which should spread culture rather than seeking to earn money. He also called on the International Council of Museums (ICOM) to stop the sale on ethical grounds. The Museum Association for the United Kingdom warned the council that it would review Northampton’s membership if it went ahead with the sale. The Arts Council of England said the sale could jeopardise the accreditation status of Northampton Museums and that could in future limit the museum's ability to obtain grant funding. Archaeologist Andy Brockman, who took part in the Save Sekhemka campaign said the sale would \"bring Northampton Council into disrepute\" and that the sale was \"opposed by museum and archaeological professionals who wish to make sure no part of Egypt's cultural history is sold off.\"\n\nICOM CIPEG also expressed concern that the sale might encourage illegal excavation and plundering of Ancient Egyptian antiquities.\n\nIn July 2013, a local politician who opposed the sale of the statue commented: \"I've read there is a curse attached to Sekhemka and if it should fall on anyone, it should fall on this administration for not having the courage to change their minds.\" The day before the sale was scheduled to take place the estate office of the Marquess of Northampton's Castle Ashby caught fire leading to stories about the \"Curse Of Sekhemka\". Fire crews from three counties fought the blaze.\n\nChristie's sold the Sekhemka statue for £15.76 m at an auction on 10 July 2014 to an anonymous buyer. The auction was briefly halted by a protester who called out that “no-one should bid or buy it...stolen property,” while a small, vocal group of Egyptian protesters demonstrated outside. The final auction price was almost £10 m more than Christie's guide price. The price obtained broke the existing world record for an Ancient Egyptian artwork sold at auction.\n\nThe Save Sekhemka Action group described the sale as a \"day of shame for Northampton\", and said that selling the statue had been \"the decision of one man [council leader David Mackintosh], taken against all professional advice locally, nationally and internationally\" The sale was described by the Egyptian Embassy as a \"shameful and unethical act\". Scott Furlong, of Arts Council England, said: \"It is very disappointing that the local authority committed to the sale and entered into an agreement with an auction house before our discussions with them were concluded.\" Northampton council leader David Mackintosh said the council's share of the proceeds would be used to develop the existing museum. The writer Alan Moore also condemned the council's decision to sell the statue.\nThe Art Fund commented the day after the sale:\nThe Arts Council announced that Northampton Museums' accreditation would be reviewed on 24 July 2014:\n\nOn 1 August 2014, Northampton Museums had their accreditation removed by the Arts Council England, who ruled that the sale broke the required standards for museums managing their collections, rendering the museums ineligible for funding from a range of arts grants and funding bodies. The museums are excluded from future participation until at least August 2019. Scott Furlong of the Arts Council commented: \"It is always hugely regrettable when we have to exclude a museum from the Accreditation Scheme. However, it is equally important that we are robust in upholding the standards and principles which underpin the scheme and are shared by the vast majority of museums.\" The leader of Northampton borough council, David Mackintosh said the Arts Council decision was \"disappointing\" and \"puzzling\", and stated \"We are possibly one of the only local authorities in the country with plans for a multimillion pound investment in their museum service.\"\n\nThe Save Sekhemka Action Group commented \"This is indeed a black and shameful day for Northampton's Culture and Heritage\" and that \"it will mean the certain decline of both the Central and Abington Museum since the loss of this statue stops the Museum Service being eligible for outside grants from the Lottery, Arts Council England and other art/cultural grant giving bodies.\" They said that the monetary loss through loss of accreditation is likely to be in excess of the £8m gross the council received from the sale of the statue.\n\nIn November 2014, the Borough Council's bid for a Heritage Lottery Fund grant of £240,400 was rejected. The funding was being sought for an exhibition of designer shoes dating from the 19th century to the present. The council said it was \"disappointed\". The Museums Association decided to ban the council from membership for five years.\n\nIn September 2014, the Friends of Northampton Museums and Art Gallery decided to wind itself up after 55 years' financial and practical service to the town. The sale of the statue was partly to blame for this; the group was against the sale, though some felt it did not fall within the group's functions.\n\nOn 30 March 2015, British culture minister Ed Vaizey placed a four-month temporary export ban on the statue, which had been sold to an unidentified overseas buyer. The Arts Council said there was a chance the statue could be sold to a UK buyer if \"a serious intention to raise funds to purchase the statue is made at the recommended price of £15,732,600 plus VAT.\"\n\nEgyptian Ambassador Ahsraf Elkholy condemned the sale as \"an abuse to the Egyptian archaeology and the cultural property,\" saying that the statue should have been given back to Egypt if the council no longer wanted it.\n\nOn 2 October 2015, Vaizey extended the export ban until 29 March 2016, after hearing of a serious bid to raise funds to save the statue for the UK. Since no-one made a counter-offer during this extension, in April 2016 the ban was lifted.\n\nOn 21 April 2015 the Save Sekhemka Action Group said that they think that a condition of the original Deed of Gift was that the statue should never be sold, making the auction illegal. The group said that they had no intention of trying to buy the statue back but suggest that it is put on display at a major museum. It is also challenging the £6m donation from the sale proceeds to the Marquess of Northampton's family. It will also examine borough council records to determine \"the legal and financial arrangements reached with the Marquis of Northampton\".\n\nThe BBC reported in October 2016 that the statue now is thought to have been exported to the United States. BBC news revealed how the council, which made £8m from the sale, had been warned by lawyers not to sell it for \"financial motives\".\nThe council said it sold the figurine to help fund a £14m extension to its museum and art gallery.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "152176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=152176", "title": "Philosopher's stone", "text": "Philosopher's stone\n\nThe philosopher's stone, or stone of the philosophers () is a legendary alchemical substance capable of turning base metals such as mercury into gold (, from the Greek χρυσός \"khrusos\", \"gold\", and ποιεῖν \"poiēin\", \"to make\") or silver. It is also called the elixir of life, useful for rejuvenation and for achieving immortality; for many centuries, it was the most sought goal in alchemy. The philosopher's stone was the central symbol of the mystical terminology of alchemy, symbolizing perfection at its finest, enlightenment, and heavenly bliss. Efforts to discover the philosopher's stone were known as the Magnum Opus (\"Great Work\").\n\nMention of the philosopher's stone in writing can be found as far back as \"Cheirokmeta\" by Zosimos of Panopolis (c. 300 AD). Alchemical writers assign a longer history. Elias Ashmole and the anonymous author of \"Gloria Mundi\" (1620) claim that its history goes back to Adam who acquired the knowledge of the stone directly from God. This knowledge was said to be passed down through biblical patriarchs, giving them their longevity. The legend of the stone was also compared to the biblical history of the Temple of Solomon and the rejected cornerstone described in Psalm 118.\n\nThe theoretical roots outlining the stone’s creation can be traced to Greek philosophy. Alchemists later used the classical elements, the concept of anima mundi, and Creation stories presented in texts like Plato's \"Timaeus\" as analogies for their process. According to Plato, the four elements are derived from a common source or prima materia (first matter), associated with chaos. \"Prima materia\" is also the name alchemists assign to the starting ingredient for the creation of the philosopher's stone. The importance of this philosophical first matter persisted throughout the history of alchemy. In the seventeenth century, Thomas Vaughan writes, \"the first matter of the stone is the very same with the first matter of all things\".\n\nEarly medieval alchemists built upon the work of Zosimos in the Byzantine Empire and the Arab empires. Byzantine and Arab alchemists were fascinated by the concept of metal transmutation and attempted to carry out the process. The 8th-century Muslim alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan (Latinized as \"Geber\") analyzed each classical element in terms of the four basic qualities. Fire was both hot and dry, earth cold and dry, water cold and moist, and air hot and moist. He theorized that every metal was a combination of these four principles, two of them interior and two exterior. From this premise, it was reasoned that the transmutation of one metal into another could be affected by the rearrangement of its basic qualities. This change would be mediated by a substance, which came to be called \"xerion\" in Greek and \"al-iksir\" in Arabic (from which the word \"elixir\" is derived). It was often considered to exist as a dry red powder (also known as \"al-kibrit al-ahmar\", red sulfur) made from a legendary stone—the philosopher's stone. The elixir powder came to be regarded as a crucial component of transmutation by later Arab alchemists.\n\nIn the 11th century, there was a debate among Muslim world chemists on whether the transmutation of substances was possible. A leading opponent was the Persian polymath Avicenna (Ibn Sina), who discredited the theory of transmutation of substances, stating, \"Those of the chemical craft know well that no change can be effected in the different species of substances, though they can produce the appearance of such change.\"\n\nAccording to legend, the 13th-century scientist and philosopher Albertus Magnus is said to have discovered the philosopher's stone. Magnus does not confirm he discovered the stone in his writings, but he did record that he witnessed the creation of gold by \"transmutation\".\n\nThe 16th-century Swiss alchemist Paracelsus (\"Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim\") believed in the existence of alkahest, which he thought to be an undiscovered element from which all other elements (earth, fire, water, air) were simply derivative forms. Paracelsus believed that this element was, in fact, the philosopher's stone.\n\nThe English philosopher Sir Thomas Browne in his spiritual testament \"Religio Medici\" (1643) identified the religious aspect of the quest for the philosopher's Stone when declaring:\n\nA mystical text published in the 17th century called the \"Mutus Liber\" appears to be a symbolic instruction manual for concocting a philosopher's stone. Called the \"wordless book\", it was a collection of 15 illustrations.\n\nThe equivalent of the philosopher's stone in Buddhism and Hinduism is the \"Cintamani\". It is also referred to as Paras/Parasmani (Hindi: पारस/पारसमणि) or Paris (Marathi: परिस).\n\nIn Mahayana Buddhism, \"Chintamani\" is held by the bodhisattvas, Avalokiteshvara and Ksitigarbha. It is also seen carried upon the back of the Lung ta (wind horse) which is depicted on Tibetan prayer flags. By reciting the Dharani of Chintamani, Buddhist tradition maintains that one attains the Wisdom of Buddhas, is able to understand the truth of the Buddhas, and turns afflictions into Bodhi. It is said to allow one to see the Holy Retinue of Amitabha and his assembly upon one's deathbed. In Tibetan Buddhist tradition the Chintamani is sometimes depicted as a luminous pearl and is in the possession of several of different forms of the Buddha.\n\nWithin Hinduism it is connected with the gods Vishnu and Ganesha. In Hindu tradition it is often depicted as a fabulous jewel in the possession of the Nāga king or as on the forehead of the Makara. The \"Yoga Vasistha\", originally written in the 10th century AD, contains a story about the philosopher's stone.\n\nA great Hindu sage wrote about the spiritual accomplishment of Gnosis using the metaphor of the philosopher's stone. Saint Jnaneshwar (1275–1296) wrote a commentary with 17 references to the philosopher's stone that explicitly transmutes base metal into gold. The seventh century Siddhar Thirumoolar in his classic \"Tirumandhiram\" explains man's path to immortal divinity. In verse 2709 he declares that the name of God, Shiva is an alchemical vehicle that turns the body into immortal gold.\n\nThe most commonly mentioned properties are the ability to transmute base metals into gold or silver, and the ability to heal all forms of illness and prolong the life of any person who consumes a small part of the philosopher's stone. Other mentioned properties include: creation of perpetually burning lamps, transmutation of common crystals into precious stones and diamonds, reviving of dead plants, creation of flexible or malleable glass, or the creation of a clone or homunculus.\n\nNumerous synonyms were used to make oblique reference to the stone, such as \"white stone\" (\"calculus albus\", identified with the \"calculus candidus\" of Revelation 2:17 which was taken as a symbol of the glory of heaven), \"vitriol\" (as expressed in the backronym \"Visita Interiora Terrae Rectificando Invenies Occultum Lapidem\"), also \"lapis noster\", \"lapis occultus\", \"in water at the box\", and numerous oblique, mystical or mythological references such as \"Adam, Aer, Animal, Alkahest, Antidotus, Antimonium, Aqua benedicta, Aqua volans per aeram, Arcanum, Atramentum, Autumnus, Basilicus, Brutorum cor, Bufo, Capillus, Capistrum auri, Carbones, Cerberus, Chaos, Cinis cineris, Crocus, Dominus philosophorum, Divine quintessence, Draco elixir, Filius ignis, Fimus, Folium, Frater, Granum, Granum frumenti, Haematites, Hepar, Herba, Herbalis, Lac, Melancholia, Ovum philosophorum, Panacea salutifera, Pandora, Phoenix, Philosophic mercury, Pyrites, Radices arboris solares, Regina, Rex regum, Sal metallorum, Salvator terrenus, Talcum, Thesaurus, Ventus hermetis\". Many of the medieval allegories for a Christ were adopted for the \"lapis\", and the Christ and the Stone were indeed taken as identical in a mystical sense. The name of \"Stone\" or \"lapis\" itself is informed by early Christian allegory, such as Priscillian (4th century), who stated \"Unicornis est Deus, nobis petra Christus, nobis lapis angularis Jesus, nobis hominum homo Christus\". In some texts it is simply called 'stone', or our stone, or in the case of Thomas Norton's Ordinal, \"oure delycious stone\". The stone was frequently praised and referred to in such terms.\n\nIt needs to be noted that \"philosophorum\" does not mean \"of the philosopher\" or \"the philosopher's\" in the sense of a single philosopher. It means \"of the philosophers\" in the sense of a plurality of philosophers.\n\nDescriptions of the Philosopher's Stone are numerous and various. According to alchemical texts, the stone of the philosophers came in two varieties, prepared by an almost identical method: white (for the purpose of making silver), and red (for the purpose of making gold), the white stone being a less matured version of the red stone. Some ancient and medieval alchemical texts leave clues to the physical appearance of the stone of the philosophers, specifically the red stone. It is often said to be orange (saffron colored) or red when ground to powder. Or in a solid form, an intermediate between red and purple, transparent and glass-like. The weight is spoken of as being heavier than gold, and it is soluble in any liquid, yet incombustible in fire.\n\nAlchemical authors sometimes suggest that the stone's descriptors are metaphorical. The appearance is expressed geometrically in Michael Maier's \"Atalanta Fugiens\". \"Make of a man and woman a circle; then a quadrangle; out of this a triangle; make again a circle, and you will have the Stone of the Wise. Thus is made the stone, which thou canst not discover, unless you, through diligence, learn to understand this geometrical teaching.\" Rupescissa uses the imagery of the Christian passion, telling us it ascends \"from the sepulcher of the Most Excellent King, shining and glorious, resuscitated from the dead and wearing a red diadem...\".\n\nThe various names and attributes assigned to the philosopher's stone has led to long-standing speculation on its composition and source. Esoteric candidates have been found in metals, plants, rocks, chemical compounds, and bodily products such as hair, urine, and eggs. Justus von Liebig states that 'it was indispensable that every substance accessible... should be observed and examined'. Alchemists once thought a key component in the creation of the stone was a mythical element named carmot.\n\nEsoteric hermetic alchemists may reject work on exoteric substances, instead directing their search for the philosopher's stone inward. Though esoteric and exoteric approaches are sometimes mixed, it is clear that some authors \"are not concerned with material substances but are employing the language of exoteric alchemy for the sole purpose of expressing theological, philosophical, or mystical beliefs and aspirations\". New interpretations continue to be developed around spagyric, chemical, and esoteric schools of thought.\n\nThe philosopher's stone is created by the alchemical method known as The Magnum Opus or The Great Work. Often expressed as a series of color changes or chemical processes, the instructions for creating the philosopher's stone are varied. When expressed in colors, the work may pass through phases of nigredo, albedo, citrinitas, and rubedo. When expressed as a series of chemical processes it often includes seven or twelve stages concluding in multiplication, and projection.\n\nThe philosopher's stone has been an inspiration, plot feature, or subject of innumerable artistic works: animations, comics, films, musical compositions, novels, and video games.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1113966", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1113966", "title": "Punk ideologies", "text": "Punk ideologies\n\nPunk ideologies are a group of varied social and political beliefs associated with the punk subculture and punk rock. In its original incarnation, the punk subculture originated out of working class angst and the frustrations many youth were feeling about economic inequality and the bourgeois hypocrisy and neglect of working people and their struggles. It was primarily concerned with concepts such as poverty, egalitarianism, humanitarianism, anti-authoritarianism, anti-corporatism, anti-consumerism, anti-war, anti-media culture, anti-mainstream or mainstream media, anti-intellectualism, against selling out, anti-conservative, anti-nationalism, anti-corporate greed, anti-infatuation, against vagrancy laws, anti-racism, anti-sexism, gender equality, racial equality, civil rights, animal rights, eco-friendly, social rights, free-thought and non-conformity. One of its main tenets was a rejection of mainstream, corporate mass culture and its values. It continued to evolve its ideology as the movement spread throughout North America from its origins in England and New York and embrace a range anti-racist and anti-sexist belief systems. Punk ideologies range from left wing views (e.g., NOFX) to right wing beliefs (e.g., No Remorse) or apolitical (e.g., Misfits).\n\nPunk ideologies are usually expressed through punk rock music and lyrics, punk literature such as amateur fanzines, spoken word performances or recordings, punk fashion, or punk visual art. Some punks have participated in direct action, such as protest or demonstration disruption, political violence, ecotage, street barricades, squatting, pirate radio, off-grid energy, vandalism and public and business property destruction. Indirect action through counter-propaganda, protests or boycotts. They support and squat in urban and rural collective house's with held group funds in common. Punk fashion was originally an expression of nonconformity, as well as opposition to both mainstream culture and the status quo. Punk fashion often displays aggression, rebellion, and individualism. Some punks wear clothing or have tattoos that express sociopolitical messages. They stage Punk Rock Food Drives such as D.O.A's Unity for Freedom. Punk visual art also often includes political messages. Many punks wear second-hand clothing, partly as an anti-consumerist statement.\n\nAn attitude common in the punk subculture is the opposition to selling out, which refers to abandoning of one's values and/or a change in musical style toward pop and embracing anything in mainstream capitalist culture or more radio-friendly rock in exchange for wealth, status, or power. Selling out also has the meaning of adopting a more mainstream lifestyle and ideology. The issue of authenticity is important in the punk subculture—the pejorative term \"poseur\" is applied to those who associate with punk and adopt its stylistic attributes but are deemed not to share or understand the underlying values or philosophy.\n\nBecause anti-establishment attitudes are such an important part of the punk subculture, a network of independent record labels, venues and distributors has developed. Some punk bands have chosen to break from this independent system and work within the established system of major labels. The do it yourself (DIY) ideal is common in the punk scene, especially in terms of music recording and distribution, concert promotion, and photocopying magazines, posters and flyers. The expression DIY was coined by commentators after the fact.\n\nOn religious issues, punk is mostly atheist or agnostic, but some punk bands have promoted religions such as Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, the Rastafari movement or Krishna.\n\nThe following include some of the most common ideologies and philosophies within the punk subculture (in alphabetical order).\n\nThere is a complex and worldwide underground of punks committed to anarchism as a serious political ideology, sometimes termed \"peace punks\" or \"anarcho-punks.\" While some well-known punk bands such as the Sex Pistols and The Exploited had songs about anarchy, notably the Pistols' \"Anarchy in the UK\", they did not embrace anarchism as a disciplined ideology. As such, these bands are not considered part of the anarcho-punk scene.\n\nAnarcho-punks typically believe in direct action. Many anarcho-punks are pacifists (e.g. Crass and Discharge) and therefore believe in using non-violent means of achieving their aims. These include peaceful protest, squatting, graffiti, culture jamming, ecotage, freeganism, boycotting, civil disobedience, hacktivism and subvertising. Some anarcho-punks believe that violence or property damage is an acceptable way of achieving social change (e.g. Conflict). This manifests itself as rioting, vandalism, wire cutting, hunt sabotage, participation in Animal Liberation Front- or Earth Liberation Front-style activities, and in extreme cases, bombings. Notable anarchist punk artists include: Aus-Rotten, Dave Insurgent, Crass, Subhumans (British band), Colin Jerwood, and Dave Dictor.\n\nIn the 1980s, both straight edge hardcore punk in the United States and anarcho-punk in the United Kingdom became associated with animal rights. Consequently, vegetarianism and veganism became a feature of the punk subculture. This association continues on into the 21st century, as evidenced by the prominence of vegan punk events such as Fluff Fest in Europe.\n\nSome punks claim to be non-political, such as the band Charged GBH and the singer G.G. Allin, although some socio-political ideas have appeared in their lyrics. Some Charged GBH songs have discussed social issues, and a few have expressed anti-war views. G.G. Allin expressed a vague desire to kill the United States president and destroy the political system in his song \"Violence Now\". Punk subgenres that are generally apolitical include: glam punk, psychobilly, horror punk, punk pathetique, deathrock and pop punk. Many of the bands credited with starting the punk movement were decidedly apolitical, including The Dictators, Ramones (which featured staunch conservative Johnny Ramone alongside liberal activist Joey Ramone), New York Dolls, Television, Johnny Thunders & The Heartbreakers, and Richard Hell & The Voidoids.\n\nChristian punk is a subgenre of punk rock with some degree of Christian lyrical content. Some Christian punk bands are associated with the Christian music industry, while others reject that association. Ideologies within Christian punk vary, though a number of bands lean towards traditional left-wing politics, most prominently Crashdog, Ballydowse and The Psalters, the latter two of whom identified as Christian anarchists. Further examples of notable Christian punk bands include Altar Boys, The Crucified, Five Iron Frenzy, Flatfoot 56, and pop-punk band MxPx, who earned a gold record in 1998.\n\nA small number are conservative, rejecting leftist-anarchism, liberalism, communism and socialism in favor of conservatism. Notable conservative punks include Johnny Ramone, Forgotten Rebels, Billy Zoom, Joe Escalante, Bobby Steele, Duane Peters and Dave Smalley. Some Christian punk and hardcore bands have conservative political stances, in particular some of the NYHC bands.\n\nThe Filipino punk band the Wuds which was formed in the early 1980s is the first known punk band who composed songs dedicated to Hare Krishna movement. In the 1990s, some notable members of the New York hardcore scene, including Ray Cappo (Youth of Today, Shelter and other bands), John Joseph (Cro-Mags) and Harley Flanagan (Cro-Mags) converted to Hare Krishna. This led to trend within the western hardcore scene that became known as Krishnacore.\n\nTaqwacore is a punk subgenre centred on Islam, its culture and its interpretation. The Taqwacore scene is composed mainly of young Muslim artists living in the United States and other western countries, many of whom openly reject traditionalist interpretations of Islam. There is no definitive Taqwacore sound, and some bands incorporate styles including hip-hop, techno, and/or musical traditions from the Muslim world. Examples of Muslim punk bands include Alien Kulture, The Kominas and Secret Trial Five.\n\nLiberal punks were in the punk subculture from the beginning, and are mostly on the liberal left. Notable liberal punks (second wave, mid-1990s to 2000s) include: Joey Ramone, Fat Mike of NOFX, Ted Leo, Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day, Crashdog, Dropkick Murphys, Hoxton Tom McCourt, Jared Gomes of Hed PE, Tim Armstrong of Rancid and Tim McIlrath of Rise Against. Some punks participated in the Rock Against Bush movement in the mid-2000s, in support of the Democratic Party candidate John Kerry.\n\nLibertarian punks advocate free market capitalism, a minimal government and private ownership of property. Joe Young of the band Antiseen, Exene Cervenka and Mojo Nixon have expressed support for libertarianism. Though originally a conservative, Michale Graves has shifted towards libertarianism in recent years.\n\nNazi punks have a white nationalist ideology that is closely related to that of white power skinheads. Ian Stuart Donaldson and his band Skrewdriver are credited with popularizing white power rock and hatecore (for its hateful lyrical themes), or Rock Against Communism. Nazi punks are different from early punks such as Sid Vicious and Siouxsie Sioux, who are believed to have incorporated Nazi imagery such as Swastikas for shock or comedy value.\n\nCentering on a belief in the abject lack of meaning and value to life, nihilism was a fixture in some early punk rock and protopunk. The Sex Pistols were central to the association of punk and nihilsm, with the \"Trouser Press Record Guide\" writing that their \"confrontational, nihilistic public image and rabidly nihilistic socio-political lyrics set the tone that continues to guide punk bands.\" However, researcher Neil Eriksen argues that though \"much of the critical realism [of punk rock] expresses cynicism and nihilism, it does serve to question existing relations in such a way that listeners are forced to think about what is being said\", so that overt rejection of meaning is primarily concerned with challenging existing values.\n\nThe Situationist International (SI) was an early influence on punk subculture in the United Kingdom. Started in continental Europe in the 1950s, the SI was an avant-garde political movement that sought to recapture the ideals of surrealist art and use them to construct new and radical social situations. Malcolm McLaren introduced situationist ideas to punk through his management of the band Sex Pistols. Vivienne Westwood, McLaren's partner and the band's designer/stylist, expressed situationist ideals through fashion that was intended to provoke a specific social response. 15% Pus and DUST, subversive 1990s Manchester bands, staged psycho-geographic walks around Hulme and created human collages from road signs as part of what became known as 'psycho-spectre.' Jamie Reid's distinctive album cover artwork was openly situationist.\n\nThe Clash were a blatantly political punk rock band, introducing socialism to the punk scene. Clash frontman Joe Strummer said of his socialist views \"I believe in socialism because it seems more humanitarian, rather than every man for himself and 'I'm alright jack' and all those asshole businessmen with all the loot. I made up my mind from viewing society from that angle. That's where I'm from and there's where I've made my decisions from. That's why I believe in socialism.\" Some of the original Oi! bands expressed a rough form of socialist working class populism — often mixed with patriotism. Many Oi! bands sang about unemployment, economic inequality, working class power and police harassment. In the 1980s, several notable British socialist punk musicians were involved with Red Wedge. Notable socialist punks include: Attila the Stockbroker, Billy Bragg, Bruce La Bruce, Garry Bushell (until the late 1980s), Chris Dean, Gary Floyd, Jack Grisham, Stewart Home, Dennis Lyxzén, Thomas Mensforth, Fermin Muguruza, Alberto Pla, Tom Robinson, Seething Wells, Paul Simmonds, Rob Tyner, Joe Strummer, Ian Svenonius, Mark Steel and Paul Weller (guitarist for British powerhouse, new wave band, The Jam). Neil Eriksen wrote in 1980: \"... we feel that elements of punk rock fulfill a revolutionary cultural function\".\n\nBernie Sanders, a democratic socialist running for president of the United States in 2016, was endorsed by various bands and musicians including Jello Biafra, Henry Rollins, Wayne Kramer, Mike Watt, Brian Baker, Keith Morris, Cheetah Chrome, Flea, Jesse Malin, Belinda Carlisle and Pussy Riot among others. In April 2016, a Richmond, VA artist named Mickael Broth, created a large mural of a Sanders which was inspired by a classic Circle Jerks logo. Sanders has also been credited as having a major impact on the east coast punk scene in the United States. In the early 1980s as mayor of Burlington, VT, Sanders fought a government ban on live music and had a major goal of building a youth center. That center became 242 Main Street, which is currently one of the United States longest running all-ages youth-run DIY punk venues.\n\nStraight edge, which originated in the Washington DC hardcore punk scene with Minor Threat song \"Straight Edge\" written by frontman Ian MacKaye and guitarist Brian Baker. Straight edge involves abstaining from alcohol, tobacco, and recreational drug use. Some who claim the title straight edge also abstain from caffeine, casual sex and meat. (Although the Washington DC straight-edge scene exhibited a fierce allegiance for Coca-Cola, with supporters rarely, if ever, seen drinking anything else in public.) Those more strict individuals may be considered part of the hardline subculture. Unlike the shunning of meat and caffeine, refraining from casual sex was without question a practice in the original straight edge lifestyle, but it has been overlooked in many of the later reincarnations of straight edge. For some, straight edge is a simple lifestyle preference, but for others it is a political stance. In many cases, it is a rejection of the perceived self-destructive qualities of punk and hardcore culture. MacKaye has often spoken out against others labeling themselves as being Straight edge, which was never his intentions for it being a label but it became a movement one in which he became annoyed with. Notable straight edgers: Tim McIlrath, CM Punk and Davey Havok.\n\nPunk ideologies have been criticized from outside and within. The Clash occasionally accused other contemporary punk acts of selling out, such as in their songs \"(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais\" and \"Death or Glory\". Crass's song \"White Punks on Hope\" criticized the late-1970s British punk scene in general and, among other things, accused Joe Strummer of selling out and betraying his earlier socialist principles. Their song \"Punk is Dead\" attacked corporate co-option of the punk subculture. Dead Kennedys frontman Jello Biafra wrote many songs, such as \" Nazi Punks Fuck Off\", criticizing aspects of the punk subculture: \"\"Punk ain't no religious cult\nPunk means thinking for yourself\nYou ain't hardcore cos you spike your hair...\"\n\nMisfit frontman Michale Graves, who cofounded the Conservative Punk website, argued that punks have become \"hippies with mohawks\". However, he has since distanced himself from conservatism.\n\nAuthor Jim Goad has been very critical of punk ideologies in many of his writings. In his essay \"The Underground is A Lie!\", Goad argued that many punks are hypocrites, and he claimed that many punks act poor while hiding the fact they come from middle to upper class backgrounds. In \"Farts from Underground\", Goad claimed that the DIY ethic never produces anything original, and it allows poor quality work to be championed.\n\nIn their book \"The Rebel Sell\", Joseph Heath and Andrew Potter argued that counterculture politics have failed, and that the punk understanding of society is flawed. They also argued that alternative and mainstream lifestyles ultimately have the same values.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4887910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4887910", "title": "Speech and language pathology in school settings", "text": "Speech and language pathology in school settings\n\nSpeech-language pathology, also known as \"communication sciences and disorders\" in the United States, is a fast-growing profession that, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, offers about 120,000 jobs in the United States alone. The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) has 166,000 members, who are audiologists, speech-language pathologists, speech, language, and hearing scientists, and speech language pathology assistants. To begin practice in most areas of the United States, a prospective therapist must have an undergraduate degree (preferably in some area of communications) and a graduate degree (with two externships; usually about 2 to 2 1/2 years) in speech pathology. A 9-month, supervised clinical fellowship year is then completed, after which the Certificate of Clinical Competence (CCC) in speech pathology from the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) is granted. In order to be certified clinically competent the Praxis exam must be passed. In some areas the master's degree is not required. In some areas additional requirements must be met: an additional certification from ASHA in school speech pathology and audiology, certification in special education instruction, and/or and must have passed any other federal or state examinations for licensure and certification. To retain the ASHA license a minimum amount of continuing education must be completed. A doctorate is not currently required (as of June 2011), but that may change, as it has for many other areas of therapy. Speech-language pathology overlaps with many educational disciplines, such as communication sciences, linguistics, special education, and health care. This article will explore some of the fundamental elements of speech-language pathology, looking at the career in an educational setting.\n\nSpeech-Language Pathologists (SLP) are professionals who assess and diagnose individuals with speech, language, cognitive, and swallowing disorders. SLPs are informally referred to as \"speech therapist\"s. SLPs may also conduct research in the field, run a private practice, or work with large companies to improve employee-customer communication (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association). This article will focus on the aspects of speech-language pathology as practiced with young children in a school setting.\n\nFor most people, the terms \"speech\", \"language\", and \"communication\" have nearly the same definition. However, in the realm of speech-language pathology, there are important distinctions to be made.\n\nSpeech is the spoken production of language and the process through which sounds are produced. Several parts of the body work together to produce sound waves, and this motor production of speech is called articulation. The parts of the vocal tract involved with speech include the lips, tongue, teeth, throat, vocal folds, and lungs. Speech disorders affect the physical mechanisms of communication and cause problems with articulation or phonology. Examples of speech disorders include stuttering, lisping, and voice disorders.\n\nLanguage is a system used to represent thoughts and ideas. Language is made up of several rules that explain what words mean, how to make new words, and how to put words together to form sentences. A community must share the same language in order to attach meaning to utterances. The method of delivery of language may be visual (e.g., American Sign Language), auditory (e.g., English), and/or written. Humans are the only creatures innately capable of using language to discuss an endless number of topics. Language disorders can be developmental or acquired (e.g., specific language impairment and aphasia, respectively).\n\nCommunication is the exchange of information and ideas through the use of speech and language. The transfer of information is often spoken, but may also be implied through body language or contextual cues such as intonation or hesitation. Usually, communication is a four-step process:\n\n\nIf a problem occurs at any step of the process, the message might not be communicated. Without the ability to communicate through speech and language, we would not be able to tell a doctor that we have a stomach ache, choose food from a menu, or say “I love you” to our children. Communication is a most basic component of human nature and it develops before we are even conscious of it.\n\nPHAGIA & SWALLOWING\nThe process of grasping, biting, sucking, mucose making, swallowing and routine eating ability. Dysphagia can effect in many aspect of life. Dysphagia accurs in developments disorder and acquired brain and buccofacial anomalies or disease.\n\nSpeech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) have several options when seeking employment. One of the most popular is to secure a school-based position through an agency that specializes in this area. One of the largest and most respected agencies is Therapy Source, a nationwide organization founded in 2001, and based out of Plymouth Meeting, PA.\n\nEvery child develops at a different rate, but most go through the same stages. Listed below are the average ages of some important language and comprehension milestones as developed by the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association. Please note that like with any developmental timeline, these stages may be quite varied and perhaps met in a different order. A child who accomplishes these milestones differently may not necessarily have a developmental delay or speech disorder (and a child who hits these stages early is not necessarily a prodigy!).\n\n\nProblems can arise at any stage of development, as well as much later in life. They can be the result of a congenital defect, a developmental disorder, or an injury. If a problem is suspected, an assessment should be made by an SLP who can diagnose and treat communication disorders.\n\nIn a school setting, children are often screened when they start kindergarten. This process involves a rapid assessment to determine which children need further testing, diagnosis, or treatment. Often, a screening is a sort of informal interview between an SLP and a child or group of children. The child may be asked to give their name, count, pronounce the names of pictured objects, and answer open-ended questions. The purpose of these tasks is to elicit a brief language sample from the child which the SLP will use to evaluate articulation, fluency, and other aspects of speech. Screenings usually last about five minutes (Oyer 10).\n\nAfter a screening is done, an individual diagnosis must be made. This involves a one-on-one evaluation which may last two hours or more. If an individual has been referred for testing, either by a doctor, teacher, or other professional, the screening process is skipped and testing starts here. This session allows the SLP to gather information that will help in the diagnosis of a speech or language problem, as well as provide insight to possible causes, goals and objectives for therapy, and which techniques will work best for that individual. Individual evaluations often include the following components:\n\n\nAfter this evaluation, the SLP will review the results and information gathered and determine whether the individual would benefit from speech therapy. Goals and objectives of therapy are outlined and a specific treatment plan is created, drawing on the strengths and weaknesses and unique situation of that individual (Oyer 11).\n\nDisorders that affect children may affect adults differently, or even not at all. As the body grows and develops, the types of disorders that affect an individual change. Children typically exhibit developmental language disorders, but may also experience problems due to illness or injury.\n\nIn developing children, language disorders are often related to congenital disabilities or neurological or physiological results of childhood illness. These seemingly unrelated problems can seriously affect speech and language development. Children that have cognitive impairments are often delayed in development of communication skills. Different genetic syndromes that often cause cognitive impairment, such as Down syndrome or Williams syndrome, often affect different areas of speech. Children with autism tend to have difficulty communicating and expressing their emotions or desires. Sometimes this is due to specific problems with articulation or semantics, but often it is an issue of neurological development directly related to autism. Brain injuries, tumors, or seizures in children can also cause loss of language skills. Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) commonly have learning difficulties which also affect their language development. Emotional disturbances early in childhood can also affect the growth of basic communicative skills. Perhaps more obvious are the developmental and communicative consequences of childhood hearing loss (Boone 200-05).\n\nSome disorders commonly diagnosed in children:\n\nSome children have language development deficits that cannot be linked to neurological, intellectual, social, or motor causes. The child’s language skills grow much more slowly than those of typically developing children. While other children are speaking in complete sentences, using conjugated verb forms, the SLI child’s speech sounds telegraphic- lacking grammatical and functional morphemes (e.g., \"He go store\". rather than \"He goes to the store\".) Their vocabulary remains relatively small while other children are adding new words every day. The SLI child often produces short sentences in order to avoid embarrassment and may have problems understanding complex or figurative structures (such as metaphors or multi-clausal sentences). Problems due to SLI can also lead to learning disabilities as the child fails to understand information being presented in science, language arts, or math classes. Studies suggest that the cause of SLI is a biological difference in brain anatomy and development (Boone 204). Treatment objectives generally focus on vocabulary development, verb morphology, memory and recall, and narrative skills (Goffman 154).\n\nAn articulation disorder may be diagnosed when a child has difficulty producing phonemes, or speech sounds, correctly. When classifying a sound, speech pathologists refer to the manner of articulation, the place of articulation, and voicing. A speech sound disorder may include one or more errors of place, manner, or voicing of the phoneme.\n\nDifferent types of articulation disorders include:\n\n\nThe phonemes that present the greatest challenge for children include /l/ as in \"pull\", /r/ as in \"mirror\", /ʃ/ (\"sh\") as in \"shut\", /tʃ/ (\"ch\") as in \"church\", /dʒ/ (\"j\") as in \"fudge\", /z/ as in \"zoo\", /ʒ/ (\"zh\") as in \"measure\", /θ/ (\"th\") as in \"math\" and /ð/ (\"th\") as in \"this\" (Boone 112).\n\nArticulation disorders may be attributed to a variety of causes. A child with hearing loss may not be able to hear certain phonemes pronounced at certain frequencies, or hear the error in their own production of sounds. Oral-motor problems may also be at fault, such as \"developmental verbal dyspraxia\" (a problem with coordination of speech muscles) or \"dysarthria\" (abnormal facial muscle tone, often due to neurological problems such as cerebral palsy). Abnormalities in the structure of the mouth and other speech muscles can cause problems with articulation; cleft palate, tongue thrust, and dental-orthodontia abnormalities are some common examples. Finally, it is difficult for children to hear and produce all of the different phonemes of a given language. Development is slow, and may take up to seven years. Sometimes, as children grow, articulation problems fade and disappear without treatment. Often, however, therapy is necessary. Treatment therapies may target semantic differences related to phonemic differences (e.g., teaching a child the difference between \"toe\" and \"toad\", underlining the importance of the final consonant), physical-motor differences (e.g., using a mirror to show a child the correct tongue placement for a particular sound), or behavior-modification techniques (e.g., repetitive production through prompts and fun learning games). Support and reinforcement of therapy practices, both in the classroom and at home, are crucial to the success of articulation disorder treatment (Boone 122-24, 259-62, 274-76).\n\nIt is necessary to note the difference between articulation disorders and dialectical variations. There are several dialects of English spoken in the United States, influenced by socioeconomic status, geographic isolation, and other languages either brought to the U.S. by settlers or indigenous languages of the Native Americans. These social dialects are rule-governed and are not to be considered lesser than, but simply different from standard English. Examples of dialectical features that may be mistaken for articulation disorders include the 'r-lessness' of New York City speech in words like floor, here, and paper as well as the reduction of consonant clusters in African-American Vernacular English (AAVE). If a word ends with two or more consonants such as in \"cold\", and is followed by another word that begins with a consonant such as \"cuts\", \"cold\" is shortened to \"col\", producing \"col cuts\". These features alone should not be treated as articulation disorders to be 'cured' by speech therapy. However, it is possible for a child with a dialectal variation to also have a communication disorder. It is important for a speech pathologist to be able to tell the difference (Oyer 170).\n\nChildren may experience problems with their voice due to misuse or abnormalities in the vocal mechanisms. There are two types of voice disorders: those of phonation, and those of resonance. Both types can be the result of either abuse or physical structure. Voice disorders are among the most successfully treated speech and language problems because they can be solved with surgery or reconditioning of the voice (Boone 286).\n\nA phonation disorder is a problem with pitch, loudness, or intensity that originates in the vocal folds of the larynx. Phonation disorders may be \"functional\", caused by continuous yelling or throat clearing, excessive smoking, or speaking at an abnormally low frequency or pitch. The results may be an increased size or thickening of the vocal folds, lesions or polyps on the vocal folds, or problems with elasticity of the larynx. In these cases, the treatment involves resting the voice and learning to speak at optimal pitches and volumes, as well as eliminating external causes such as smoking. Phonation disorders may also be \"organic\", due to viral growths, cancer, paralysis of laryngeal nerves, surgical intubation, or external traumas such as being hit in the throat with a baseball. These problems may require surgical removal of growths or reconstruction of the larynx, accompanied by voice therapy (Boone 287-96).\n\nA resonance disorder occurs when any part of the vocal tract is altered or dysfunctional.\n\nIn the case of an \"oral\" resonance disorder, the tongue sits too high in the front or back of the mouth. When the tongue is too far forward in the mouth, a type of ‘baby voice’ occurs, and a lisp may also result. Treatment involves practicing back vowels such as /a/ in \"father\", /o/ in \"boat\", and /u/ in \"spoon\", accompanied by back consonants like /k/ in \"broke\" and /g/ in \"bog\". When the tongue sits toward the back of the mouth, the voice sounds dull, and problems with articulation at the front of the mouth may also occur. Treatment focuses on front consonants such as /w/ in \"where\" or \"work\", /p/ in \"pink\", /b/ in \"ball\", /f/ in \"laugh\", /v/ in \"leave\", /l/ in \"mail\", and /th/ in \"with\" or \"bath\" coupled with high-front vowels like /i/ in \"wheat\", /I/ in \"fit\", /e/ in \"pay\", /E/ in \"bet\", and /ae/ in \"slat\". This type of resonance disorder is commonly seen in children with severe hearing impairment.\n\n\"Nasal\" resonance disorders occur when the space between the oral and nasal cavities remains open or closed, producing a \"hypernasal\" or \"denasal\" resonance. Causes of hypernasality include paralysis of the velum, a short velum, or a cleft palate which allows air to escape to the nasal cavity. The speech of actor James Stewart is a recognizable example of hypernasality (although in this case, there was no structural problem; rather, he employed the highly nasal voice as part of his character). Denasality is often caused by a structural blockage which doesn’t allow air to pass between the oral and nasal cavities. A child experiencing denasality may sound like they have a bad cold. If a structural problem is to blame, surgery is the most common treatment. After surgery, or if there is no structural cause, voice therapy is often given, involving massive amounts of practice (Boone 305-12).\n\nAs a child’s language and vocabulary grows, they may struggle to locate a particular word or sound. Normal dysfluency occurs in developing children as a repetition of whole words or phrases while the child searches for a particular thought or word. Around age three-and-a-half, children may compulsively repeat words or phrases. This tends to fade by the time the child is five. Stuttering, in contrast, results in repeated or prolonged speech sounds or syllables. Often, involuntary blocks in fluency will be accompanied by muscle tension due to frustration. The mouth may tighten up or the eyes may blink rapidly. A child may become so embarrassed by stuttering that they talk as little as possible to avoid the struggle. This may have serious academic and social implications. The cause of stuttering is unknown, yet widely debated. Most theories suggest emotional, psychological, or neurological origins. Psychological treatment aims at improving the self-image of the child and the child’s attitude toward the problem, while other therapies attempt to increase fluency by modifying the rhythm and rate of speech (Boone 316-29, 335-38).\n\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health, it is estimated that, in the United States,\n\n\nAccording to the United States Department of Education, speech, language, and hearing impairments account for 20.1 percent of all Special Education students in the United States.\n\nCommunication skills play an important part in life’s experiences. In elementary school, children are developing language and learning to read and write. In order for a child to learn, he has to communicate and interact with his peers and adults. Spoken language is the basis for written language. As a child grows and develops, the two types of language interact and build upon each other to improve literacy and language. This process continues throughout a person’s life. If a child has a communication disorder, they are often delayed in other areas, such as reading and math. The child may be very bright but unable to express themselves correctly, and the learning process can be affected negatively.\n\nSpeech therapy can help children learn to communicate effectively with others and learn to solve problems and make decisions independently. Communication with peers and educators is an essential part of a fulfilling educational experience.\nAlso, children who are able to overcome communication disorders feel a great sense of pride and confidence. Children who stutter may be withdrawn socially, but with the help of therapy and improved confidence, they can enjoy a fully active social life (\"ASHA\").\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1757652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1757652", "title": "Trifunctional hypothesis", "text": "Trifunctional hypothesis\n\nThe trifunctional hypothesis of prehistoric Proto-Indo-European society postulates a tripartite ideology (\"idéologie tripartite\") reflected in the existence of three classes or castes—priests, warriors, and commoners (farmers or tradesmen)—corresponding to the three functions of the sacral, the martial and the economic, respectively. The trifunctional thesis is primarily associated with the French mythographer Georges Dumézil, who proposed it in 1929 in the book \"Flamen-Brahman\", and later in \"Mitra-Varuna\".\n\nAccording to Dumézil (1898-1986), Proto-Indo-European society comprised three main groups corresponding to three distinct functions:\n\nIn the Proto-Indo-European mythology each social group had its own god or family of gods to represent it and the function of the god or gods matched the function of the group. Many such divisions occur in the history of Indo-European societies:\n\nSupporters of the hypothesis include scholars such as Émile Benveniste, Bernard Sergent and Iaroslav Lebedynsky, who concludes that \"the basic idea seems proven in a convincing way\".\n\nThe hypothesis was embraced outside the field of Indo-European studies by some mythographers, anthropologists, and historians such as Mircea Eliade, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Marshall Sahlins, Rodney Needham, Jean-Pierre Vernant and Georges Duby.\n\nOn the other hand, Allen concludes that the tripartite division may be an artefact, a selection effect rather than an organizing principle used in the societies themselves. Benjamin W. Fortson reports a sense that Dumézil blurred the lines between the three functions and the examples that he gave often had contradictory characteristics, causing detractors to reject his categories as non-existent. John Brough surmises that societal divisions are common outside of Indo-European societies as well, and consequently the hypothesis has only limited utility in illuminating prehistoric Indo-European society. Cristiano Grottanelli states that while Dumézilian trifunctionalism may be seen in modern and medieval contexts, its projection onto earlier cultures is mistaken. Belier is strongly critical.\n\nThe hypothesis has been criticised by historians Carlo Ginzburg, Arnaldo Momigliano and Bruce Lincoln as being based on Dumézil's sympathies with the political right. Guy Stroumsa sees these criticisms as unfounded.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5575042", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5575042", "title": "World War Z", "text": "World War Z\n\nWorld War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War is a 2006 apocalyptic horror novel written by American author Max Brooks. The novel is a collection of individual accounts narrated by an agent of the United Nations Postwar Commission, following the devastating global conflict against the zombie plague. Other passages record a decade-long desperate struggle, as experienced by people of various nationalities. The personal accounts also describe the resulting social, political, religious, and environmental changes.\n\n\"World War Z\" is a follow-up to Brooks' \"survival manual\", \"The Zombie Survival Guide\" (2003), but its tone is much more serious. It was inspired by \"The Good War: An Oral History of World War Two\" (1984) by Studs Terkel, and by the zombie films of George A. Romero. Brooks used \"World War Z\" to comment on government ineptitude and U.S. isolationism, while also examining survivalism and uncertainty. The novel was a commercial hit and was praised by most critics.\n\nIts audiobook version, performed by a full cast including Alan Alda, Mark Hamill, and John Turturro, won an Audie Award in 2007. A film with the same name as the novel, directed by Marc Forster and starring Brad Pitt, was released in 2013.\n\nThe story is told in the form of a series of interviews conducted by the narrator, Max Brooks, an agent of the United Nations Postwar Commission. Although the exact origin of the plague is unknown, a young boy from a village in Chongqing, China is identified as the plague's official patient zero. The plague spreads to various nations by human trafficking, refugees and the black market organ trade. Initially these nations are able to cover up their smaller outbreaks, until a much larger outbreak in South Africa brings the plague to public attention.\n\nAs the infection spreads, Israel abandons the Palestinian territories and initiates a nationwide \"cordon sanitaire\", closing its borders to everyone except uninfected Jews and Palestinians. The United States does little to prepare because of its overconfidence in its ability to suppress any threat. Although special forces teams contain initial outbreaks, a widespread effort never starts: the nation is deprived of political will by \"brushfire wars\", and a widely distributed and marketed placebo vaccine, Phalanx, creates a false sense of security.\n\nAfter a journalist reveals that Phalanx does nothing to prevent zombification, a period known as the \"Great Panic\" begins. Pakistan and Iran destroy each other in a nuclear war over Pakistani refugees entering Iran. After zombies overrun New York City, the U.S. military sets up a high-profile defense in the nearby city of Yonkers. The \"Battle of Yonkers\" is a disaster; modern weapons and tactics prove ineffective against zombies, which have no self-preservation instincts, feel no pain, and can only be stopped if shot through the head. The unprepared and demoralized soldiers are routed on live television. Other countries suffer similarly disastrous defeats, and human civilization teeters on the brink of collapse.\n\nIn South Africa, the government adopts a contingency plan drafted by apartheid-era intelligence consultant Paul Redeker, known as the Redeker Plan. It calls for the establishment of small sanctuaries, leaving large groups of survivors abandoned in special zones as human baits in order to distract the undead and allowing those within the main safe zone time to regroup and recuperate. Governments worldwide assume similar plans. As zombies freeze solid in extreme cold, many civilians in North America flee to the wildernesses of northern Canada and the Arctic, where eleven million people die of starvation and hypothermia. Several astronauts stranded aboard the ISS witness the profound environmental impact as most of humanity resorts to burning wood and trash for warmth.\n\nAfter the U.S. government relocates to Hawaii, the military abandons the eastern United States and establishes safe zones west of the Rocky Mountains. All aspects of civilian life are devoted to supporting the war effort; people with skills such as carpentry and construction find themselves more valuable than people with managerial skills.\n\nSeven years after the outbreak began, a conference is held off the coast of Honolulu, aboard the decommissioned , where the new United Nations headquarters are located. Most of the world's leaders argue that they can outlast the zombie plague if they stay in their safe zones while the zombies rot away. However, the U.S. president argues for going on the offensive, and a general vote results in most countries either voting \"no\" or \"abstain\" while the remainder decide to attack. Determined to lead by example, the U.S. military reinvents itself to meet the specific strategic requirements of fighting the undead. Backed by a resurgent U.S. wartime economy, the military begins the three-year-long process of retaking the contiguous United States from both the undead swarms and groups of hostile human survivors. Other nations that voted to attack go about their own offensives: Britain takes a slow-but-steady approach, taking until five years after the official end of the war to finish clearing London, while France, set on restoring its pride and reputation after embarrassments and defeats going back to World War II, charges headlong against the undead, its armed forces displaying extreme valor at an extraordinarily high cost. An unnamed British Army general comments as the war ends that there are \"enough dead heroes for the end of time.\"\n\nTen years after the official end of the zombie war, millions of zombies are still active, mainly on the ocean floor or on snow line islands. The United Nations fields a large military force to eliminate them. Cuba has become a democracy and hosts the world's most thriving economy. Tibet is freed from Chinese rule, which in turn becomes a democracy as well, and hosts Lhasa as the world's most populated city. Following a religious revolution, Russia is now an expansionist theocracy and adopts a repopulation programme. North Korea is completely empty, with the entire population presumed to have disappeared into underground bunkers or been wiped out in the outbreak. Iceland has been depopulated and remains the world's most heavily infested country.\n\nBrooks designed \"World War Z\" to follow the \"laws\" set up in his earlier work, \"The Zombie Survival Guide\" (2003), and explained that the guide may exist in the novel's fictional universe. The zombies of \"The Zombie Survival Guide\" are human bodies reanimated by an incurable virus (Solanum), devoid of intelligence, desirous solely of consuming living flesh, and cannot be killed unless the brain is destroyed. It is said that the undead contain a black, foul pus-like liquid instead of blood. Decomposition will eventually set in, but this process takes longer than for an uninfected body and can be slowed even further by effects such as freezing. Although zombies do not tire and are as strong as the humans they infect (though they appear to be slightly stronger due to lack of normal restraint), they are slow-moving and are incapable of planning or cooperation in their attacks. Zombies usually reveal their presence by moaning.\n\nBrooks discussed the cultural influences on the novel. He claimed inspiration from \"\"The Good War\": An Oral History of World War Two\" (1984) by Studs Terkel, stating: \"[Terkel's book is] an oral history of World War II. I read it when I was a teenager and it's sat with me ever since. When I sat down to write \"World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War\", I wanted it to be in the vein of an oral history.\" Brooks also cited renowned zombie film director George A. Romero as an influence and criticized the \"Return of the Living Dead\" films: \"They cheapen zombies, make them silly and campy. They've done for the living dead what the old \"Batman\" TV show did for the Dark Knight.\" Brooks acknowledged making several references to popular culture in the novel, including one to alien robot franchise \"Transformers\", but declined to identify the others so that readers could discover them independently.\n\nBrooks conducted copious research while writing \"World War Z\". The technology, politics, economics, culture, and military tactics were based on a variety of reference books and consultations with expert sources. Brooks also cites the U.S. Army as a reference on firearm statistics. \n\nReviewers have noted that Brooks uses \"World War Z\" as a platform to criticize government ineptitude, corporate corruption, and human short-sightedness. At one point in the book, a Palestinian refugee living in Kuwait refuses to believe the dead are rising, fearing it is a trick by Israel. Many U.S. characters blame the United States' inability to counter the zombie threat on low confidence in their government due to conflicts in the Middle East.\n\nBrooks shows his particular dislike of government bureaucracy. For example, one character in the novel tries to justify lying about the zombie outbreak to avoid widespread panic, while at the same time failing to develop a solution for fear of arousing public ire. He has also criticized U.S. isolationism:\n\nSurvivalism and disaster preparation are prevalent themes in the novel. Several interviews, especially those from the United States, focus on policy changes designed to train the surviving U.S. population to fight the zombies and rebuild the country. For example, when cities were made to be as efficient as possible in order to fight the zombies, the plumber could hold a higher status than the former CEO. The ultra-rich hid in their homes, which had been turned into fortified compounds, when they were overwhelmed by others trying to get in, it became a mass slaughter. Throughout the novel, characters demonstrate the physical and mental requirements needed to survive a disaster. Brooks described the large amount of research needed to find optimal methods for fighting a worldwide zombie outbreak. He also pointed out that the U.S. likes the zombie genre because it believes that it can survive anything with the right tools and talent.\n\nBrooks considers the theme of uncertainty central to the zombie genre. He believes that zombies allow people to deal with their own anxiety about the end of the world. Brooks has expressed a deep fear of zombies:\n\nThis mindlessness is connected to the context in which Brooks was writing. He declared: \"at this point we're pretty much living in an irrational time\", full of human suffering and lacking reason or logic. When asked in a subsequent interview about how he would compare terrorists with zombies, Brooks said:\n\nDuring an appearance on \"George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight\", Brooks' friend and contemporary novelist Chuck Palahniuk revealed that a major influence on \"World War Z\" was the deterioration and death via cancer of Brooks' mother, Anne Bancroft. According to Palahniuk, Brooks' attempt to find the right oncologists to treat Bancroft parallels the mission in the novel to find a cure for the zombie plague. Brooks subsequently dedicated to novel to Bancroft.\n\nReviews for the novel have been generally positive. Gilbert Cruz of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the novel an \"A\" rating, commenting that the novel shared with great zombie stories the use of a central metaphor, describing it as \"an addictively readable oral history.\" Steven H. Silver identified Brooks' international focus as the novel's greatest strength and commented favorably on Brooks' ability to create an appreciation for the work needed to combat a global zombie outbreak. Silver's only complaint was with \"Good-Byes\"—the final chapter—in which characters get a chance to give a final closing statement. Silver felt that it was not always apparent who the sundry, undifferentiated characters were. \"The Eagle\" described the book as being \"unlike any other zombie tale\" as it is \"sufficiently terrifying for most readers, and not always in a blood-and-guts way, either.\" Keith Phipps of \"The A.V. Club\" stated that the format of the novel makes it difficult for it to develop momentum, but found the novel's individual episodes gripping. Patrick Daily of the \"Chicago Reader\" said the novel transcends the \"silliness\" of \"The Zombie Survival Guide\" by \"touching on deeper, more somber aspects of the human condition.\" In his review for \"Time Out Chicago\", Pete Coco declared that \"[b]ending horror to the form of alternative history would have been novel in and of itself. Doing so in the mode of Studs Terkel might constitute brilliance.\"\n\nRon Currie Jr. named \"World War Z\" one of his favorite apocalyptic novels and praised Brooks for illustrating \"the tacit agreement between writer and reader that is essential to the success of stories about the end of the world ... [both] agree to pretend that this is not fiction, that in fact the horrific tales of a war between humans and zombies are based in reality.\" Drew Taylor of the \"Fairfield County Weekly\" credited \"World War Z\" with making zombies more popular in mainstream society.\n\nThe hardcover version of \"World War Z\" spent four weeks on the \"New York Times\" Best Seller list, peaking at number nine. By November 2011, according to \"Publishers Weekly\", \"World War Z\" had sold one million copies in all formats.\n\nRandom House published an abridged audiobook in 2007, directed by John Mc Elroy and produced by Dan Zitt, with sound editing by Charles De Montebello. The book is read by Brooks but includes other actors taking on the roles of the many individual characters who are interviewed in the novel. Brooks' previous career in voice acting and voice-over work meant he could recommend a large number of the cast members.\n\nOn May 14, 2013, Random House Audio released a lengthier audiobook titled \"World War Z: The Complete Edition (Movie Tie-in Edition): An Oral History of the Zombie War\". It contains the entirety of the original, abridged audiobook, as well as new recordings of each missing segment. A separate, additional audiobook containing only the new recordings not found in the original audiobook was released simultaneously as \"World War Z: The Lost Files: A Companion to the Abridged Edition\".\n\n\nIn her review of the audiobook for \"Strange Horizons\", Siobhan Carroll called the story \"gripping\" and found the listening experience evocative of Orson Welles's famous radio narration of \"The War of the Worlds\" (broadcast October 30, 1938). Carroll had mixed opinions on the voice acting, commending it as \"solid and understated, mercifully free of 'special effects' and 'scenery chewing' overall\", but lamenting what she perceived as undue cheeriness on the part of Max Brooks and inauthenticity in Steve Park's Chinese accent. \"Publishers Weekly\" also criticized Brooks' narration, but found that the rest of the \"all-star cast deliver their parts with such fervor and intensity that listeners cannot help but empathize with these characters\". In an article in \"Slate\" concerning the mistakes producers make on publishing audiobooks, Nate DiMeo used \"World War Z\" as an example of dramatizations whose full casts contributed to making them \"great listens\" and described the book as a \"smarter-than-it-has-any-right-to-be zombie novel\". The \"World War Z\" audiobook won the 2007 Audie Award for Multi-Voiced Performance and was nominated for Audiobook of the Year.\n\nIn June 2006, Paramount Studios secured the film rights for \"World War Z\" for Brad Pitt's production company, Plan B Entertainment, to produce. The screenplay was written by J. Michael Straczynski, with Marc Forster directing and Pitt starring as the main character, UN employee Gerry Lane.\n\nDespite being the draft that got the film green-lit, Straczynski's script was tossed aside. Production was to begin at the start of 2009, but was delayed while the script was completely re-written by Matthew Michael Carnahan to set the film in the present, leaving behind much of the book's premise to make it more of an action film. In a 2012 interview, Brooks stated the film now had nothing in common with the novel other than the title. Filming commenced mid-2011, and the film was released in June 2013.\n\n\n"}
