As of 2018, it has been acquired by AccorHotels and manages eight properties in Louisville, Kentucky; Lexington, Kentucky; Cincinnati, Ohio; Bentonville, Arkansas, Durham, North Carolina, Oklahoma City, OK, Kansas City, MO and Nashville, Tennessee. \n\n21c Museum Hotel was voted among the Top 10 Hotels in the World in the \"Condé Nast Traveler\" Readers' Choice Awards in 2009, 2010 and 2011. It was also voted as the No. 1 Hotel in the South in the 2012 \"Condé Nast Traveler\" Readers' Choice Awards.\n21c Museum Hotel Cincinnati was named the top hotel in America in 2013 by Conde Nast Traveler's annual reader survey, and 11th in the world.\n\n21c Museum Hotel was launched in 2006 by philanthropists and art collectors Laura Lee Brown and Steve Wilson. The pair had seen farmland and rural landscapes fall to development while the historic buildings of Louisville's downtown sat vacant. They created 21c in Louisville's downtown arts and theater district to support both urban renewal and regional agriculture, and have developed partnerships with local growers to supply produce and ingredients for the Proof on Main restaurant and bar.\n\nFollowing the success of the Louisville location, additional 21c locations were put into motion, with 7 currently in operation and more in the planning or construction stages.\n\nIn July 2018, 21C Museum Hotels was acquired by the French Hotel Group AccorHotels for a sum of $51 Million. Founders Brown and Wilson maintain a 15% stake and continue to be involved with the company.\n\n21c Museum is North America's only museum dedicated to collecting and exhibiting contemporary art of the 21st century. The museum is open free of charge 24 hours a day, seven days a week. More than twenty special exhibitions and installations have been organized by the 21c Museum since its opening in 2006.\n\nRecent exhibitions include: \"Creating Identity: Portraiture Today;\" \"All's Fair in Art and War: Envisioning Conflict;\" \"Tangled Up In You: Connecting, Coexisting, and Conceiving Identity,\" and \"Hybridity: The Evolution of Species and Spaces in 21st-Century Art.\" 21c Museum has presented projects by Mikhail Baryshnikov and John Waters, as well as traveling exhibitions including Marc Swanson: Beginning to See the Light, organized by the Santa Barbara Contemporary Arts Forum, and Constant World: the Work of Jennifer and Kevin McCoy, organized by Beall Center for Art and Technology, University of California, Irvine.\n\nThe 21c Museum features permanent installations and special exhibitions of works by artists, including Bill Viola, Tony Oursler, Andres Serrano, Sam Taylor-Wood, David Levinthal, Yinka Shonibare, Judy Fox, Chuck Close, Alfredo Jaar, David Herbert, Daan Roosegaarde, Kara Walker and Serkan Özkaya (\"David\").\n\nThe museum also displays a number of original site-specific commissions, including:\n\nThe Louisville location renovated five 19th century tobacco and bourbon warehouse buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places to house the museum, hotel, and its restaurant. It is located within the city's arts and theater district along \"Museum Row,\" which is home to the Louisville Slugger Museum and Factory, the Muhammad Ali Center, the Frazier History Museum, the Kentucky Museum of Art and Craft, and the Kentucky Science Center. This location has a restaurant named Proof on Main, which was named one of \"Best New Restaurants 2006\" by \"Esquire\" magazine. The menu features ingredients from local farms and food purveyors, as well as 50 types of bourbon.\n\nThe facility was designed by Deborah Berke & Partners Architects, for which they won the American Institute of Architects Kentucky Honor Award in 2011, the AIA NYS Excellence for Historic Preservation/Adaptive Reuse in 2007, and the Best of Year Award for Hospitality Design, Interior Design Magazine, in 2006.\n\nThe Cincinnati location involved the complete renovation of the historic Hotel Metropole, a grand building that's most previous use was section 8 apartments for low income residents. $48 million was spent on the renovation.\n\nThe third location in Bentonville opened in 2013. The museum hotel is a small walk away from the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art. The hotel is located on land that was once a corn field outside of the urban center of Bentonville. \n\nThe Bentonville location was named one of the top 15 hotels in the US by Travel + Leisure Magazine in 2017. \n\nIn March 2015 21c opened its fourth hotel in Durham, North Carolina. In 2013 the company bought the historic Hill Building for $5.25 million. With an investment of $48 million the Hill Building was renovated and converted into a hotel with 125 rooms. The hotel is centrally located in Downtown Durham and is a short walk from the Durham Bulls Stadium, the DPAC and the Carolina Theater.\n\nIn February 2016 the Lexington hotel opened in the Fayette National Bank (aka First National Bank) building.\n\nIn June 2016 21c opened a hotel in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma in the Fred Jones Assembly Plant built in 1915, where the Ford Model T was assembled. The hotel has been to Travel + Leisure magazine’s 2017 It List of Best New Hotels Around the World, as one of 44 best new and radically redone hotels and resorts around the world of the past year.\n\nIn May 2017 the Nashville hotel opened in the historic Gray & Dudley building in downtown.\n\nIn July 2018 the group opened their 120 suite and gallery hotel in Kansas City, Missouri inside the historic Savoy Hotel and Grill \n\nTwo additional properties are in active development. A location in Des Moines, Iowa is expected to complete construction by 2021, and a location planned for a former church site in Miami has construction underway as of 2018. \n\nThe company had been looking to open a hotel in Indianapolis in the old city hall, with construction scheduled to begin in 2017, however these plans were scrapped at the end of March 2017 due to problems with financing. 21c Museum Hotels will still be seeking to open a location in the city.\n\nEach 21c location has an onsite restaurant, with many receiving recognition and awards including multiple James Beard Foundation Award finalists for excellence in cuisine.\n\nEach restaurant reflects the local flavor and cuisine of its home city.

{"id": "177250", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=177250", "title": "Aleatoricism", "text": "Aleatoricism\n\nAleatoricism is the incorporation of chance into the process of creation, especially the creation of art or media. The word derives from the Latin word \"alea\", the rolling of dice. \"Aleatory\" should not be confused with either improvisation or indeterminacy.\n\nCharles Hartman discusses several methods of automatic generation of poetry in his book \"The Virtual Muse\".\n\nThe term aleatory music was first coined by Werner Meyer-Eppler in 1955 to describe a course of sound events that is \"determined in general but depends on chance in detail\". When his article was published in English, the translator mistakenly rendered his German noun \"Aleatorik\" as an adjective, and so inadvertently created a new English word, \"aleatoric\". Pierre Boulez applied the term in this sense to his own pieces to distinguish them from the indeterminate music of John Cage. While Boulez purposefully composed his pieces to allow the performer certain liberties with regard to the sequencing and repetition of parts, Cage often composed through the application of chance operations without allowing the performer liberties. Another prolific composer of aleatory music was Karlheinz Stockhausen.\n\nAleatoric techniques are sometimes used in contemporary film music. Examples can be found in John Williams's scores as well as, for example, Mark Snow's music for \"X-Files: Fight the Future\".\n\nIn film-making, there are several avant-garde examples; one is Andy Voda's \"Chance Chants\" which features Allison Knowles' computer poem \"House of Dust\", \n\nFred Camper's \"SN\" (1984, first screening 2002) uses coin-flipping for one section to determine which three of 16 possible reels to screen and what order they should go in (3360 permutations).\n\nFilm scholar Barry Salt directed the 1971 film \"Six Reels of Film to Be Shown in Any Order\".\n\n\n"}

All three members have Māori ancestry and several of their songs are written in te reo Māori.\n\nAlien Weaponry was formed in Auckland in 2010 by guitarist and vocalist Lewis de Jong and drummer Henry de Jong who were only 8 and 10 years old respectively. The brothers named the band Alien Weaponry after watching the movie District 9 and after moving to the small town of Waipu were joined by bass guitarist Ethan Trembath in April 2013. Trembath replaced Wyatt Channings who had briefly played bass for the band the previous year. \n\nIn 2016 the band won both the national finals of Smokefreerockquest and Smokefree Pacifica Beats—the only band to have ever won both events. They had previously come second in the 2015 Smokefree Rockquest, and been regional finalists for four years running. The band also toured with New Zealand chart topping band Devilskin on their \"We Rise\" tour in 2014 and performed at The Powerstation in support of Shihad in May 2015. Alien Weaponry are believed to be youngest recipients to have ever received New Zealand on Air funding with their song \"Ru Ana Te Whenua\" in October 2015. They received a $10,000 grant to complete recording of their song and produce a video in 2015 and then another two $10,000 NZ On Air grants in 2016 to record their singles \"Urutaa\" and \"Raupatu\" and produce music videos. \n\nIn 2016 the band was named by UK Metal Hammer Magazine as one of New Zealand's top 10 hard rock and metal acts.\n\nAlien Weaponry released their début EP \"The Zego Sessions\" and in August 2014 and began work on a new album at Neil Finn's Roundhead Studios in Auckland with record producer Tom Larkin in September 2015. In November 2016 Alien Weaponry released their single and music video for \"Urutaa\" as the first offering from their upcoming album. February 2017 saw the release of their second single \"Raupatu\" and in July 2017 they released \"Rū Ana Te Whenua\".\n\nOn 1 June 2018 their album Tū was released, debuting at number five on the New Zealand album charts , the top New Zealand album of the week. The album had over a million streams on Spotify in its first week of release; and tracks from it were added to over 8,000 playlists worldwide, including Spotify's own metal genre playlists New Blood, New Metal Tracks, Kickass Metal and Thrash Metal Big 4 & Friends. Songs from the album were also playlisted by over 50 radio stations in the USA in its first week, with the band’s single ‘Kai Tangata’ rocketing to no.1 on the prestigious ‘Devil’s Dozen’ countdown for the Liquid Metal show on New York based Sirius XM toppling metal heavyweights Parkway Drive from the top slot.\n\nAlien Weaponry's début single, \"Urutaa\", is sung partly in the Māori language and was originally about a clash of ideas and expectations leading to stress and unhappiness, which was likened to a plague or \"urutaa\" (an outbreak). The Maori lyrics refer to events that occurred in the Bay of Islands in the 1800s and what followed after a pocket watch was inadvertently dropped into the harbour. The misunderstanding culminated in the burning of the Boyd, a grim set of events in New Zealand's colonial history. Says the band \"This incident is used in this song as a metaphor for the misunderstandings that continue to plague us today – between cultures, generations and individuals who torment each other through lack of understanding.\"\n\nThe band's second single \"Raupatu\" (released in February 2017) is about land confiscations by the New Zealand colonial government in the 1800s and the unjust legislation of 1863 that allowed it to happen. Their third single, \"Rū Ana te Whenua\" (the trembling earth), released 1 July 2017, refers to the mighty battle at Pukehinahina/Gate Pa in 1864 where their great great great grandfather, Te Ahoaho, lost his life.\n\n"}

The only partially comprehensible inscription is an invocation of the god Phoebus Apollo and may have been composed in central Greece or western Asia Minor. As such magical amulets are known to have been mass-produced, the existence of MS 5236 indicates that, despite the singularity of the foil, an inkless block printing process was practised in ancient Greece to a certain degree, for texts of some length, beyond the examples known from Roman lead pipe inscriptions and the many types of stamps used to mark bricks and pottery with the maker's name and other details. \n\nThe lamella is registered under the inventory number MS 5236 by the private Norwegian Schøyen Collection, where it was studied by the British classicist Dominic Montserrat. The printing technique of the inscription was specifically analysed by the German typographer Herbert Brekle in 2010.\n\nMS 5236 is made of a thin, rectangular gold sheet of 2.8 x 9.0 x 0.1 cm, which is inscribed on one side. The ancient Greek text comprises six lines written from left to right; margins all around the text body suggest that its contents are fully preserved. The surface of the gold foil is marked by many small creases that have grown together into cracks. Unlike later amulets, it appears to have never been rolled up or folded for personal use.\n\nThe palaeographic analysis of the letterform indicates an early, archaic date. The script used does not clearly match any local variant of the Greek alphabet: certain letter shapes indicate an origin in Attica or Euboea, while other letters point to the ductus common in western Asia Minor, particularly that of Knidos. Overall, the comparison with other early Greek documents suggests a creation of the text in the middle of the 6th century BC.\n\nEven though the Greek text is legible on the whole (see transcription on the right), much of it remains incomprehensible due to grammatical and syntactical peculiarities, such as they were frequent in magical amulets, and some letter sequences cannot be made any sense of. Nonetheless, one can infer from the intelligible parts that the god Phoebus Apollo is being invoked in order to raise his arms against someone or something, probably to the advantage of the amulet owner. The wording does not correspond to any other ancient epigraphic and literary texts, providing further evidence that the gold foil is genuine and not a modern forgery.\n\nAccording to Montserrat, important characteristics of MS 5236 most closely correspond to the \"ephesia grammata\", magic amulets whose incantatory words were supposedly fixed in writing on the cult statue of Artemis at Ephesus, and which were carried on the body to ward off harm. Although these metal sheets circulated in the Greek world in huge numbers, only lead examples have survived, rendering the gold foil among the \"ephesia grammata\" unique.\n\nThe special significance of MS 5236 lies in the way the inscription was created. A close examination shows that a blind-stamping process was used to reproduce the Greek text on the lamella, with a single matrix carrying the whole text. In this, MS 5236 differs fundamentally from other amulets of the time, where the magic formulas were incised by hand, such as with a stylus, into the metal foil.\n\nThe entire process is reconstructed by Brekle as follows: First, the inscription's text was engraved with an iron stylus into an even copper or bronze block, with its letters facing the opposite direction and running from right to left. The displaced material rose up on both sides of the letter grooves forming two sharp, parallel ridges. In the second step, the inscribed side of the stamp block was placed on the plane gold sheet and sufficient pressure, either manually or by hammering onto a plate laid on top, was exerted from above to transmit the text. What produced the print image were the ridges caused by the material displacement; these left shallow double lines in the foil, thus creating the text. The actual, sunken letter lines were not transferred during the imprinting procedure, since they did not enter the surface of the foil.\n\nIt is the existence of these fine double grooves on the gold lamella which provides the key for identifying MS 5236 as being stamped and not written. Because it is a matter of mechanical necessity that the engraved letters appear with their raised double edges on the substrate as parallel, sunken lines when being printed, as can be observed on the amulet. Thus, the inscription is a bas-relief, which was produced by a bas-relief stamp. If the text had been carved directly into the foil as with other amulets, the stylus could have left only simple lines. According to Brekle, the applied printing technique has much in common with the later method of drypoint etching, by which an image is incised into a copper plate; however, unlike drypoint, MS 5236 is a colourless blind print.\n\nA further indication for the use of a printing technique is the varying strength of the letters, which suggests that the surface of the lamella was not completely flat during printing. Thus, the outline of the letters, as to be expected with a print, appear in the slightly more elevated regions of the sheet (darker areas in the photo), more distinct than in the slightly deeper regions (lighter areas) that were not affected by the full force of the stamp. This can be observed particularly along the folds and in the last line where the edge of the foil was apparently slightly bent downwards while being printed. Consequently, the impressions of the letters appear less marked here. If the text had been directly inscribed with a stylus into the foil, these variations would not have occurred.\n\nRegarding the stroke order of the letters on the stamp, it can be said that the Hasta, the mostly vertical main line, was normally executed before the Coda figures. \n\nMS 5236 is an overall rare and possibly unique print from the early Greek era. Despite this, the widespread use of magical amulets indicates that such block prints were, at least from the present prototype, mass-produced at that time.\n\n\n\n"}

French scholar Marie-France Toinet says use of the term \"anti-Americanism\" is \"only fully justified if it implies systematic opposition – a sort of allergic reaction – to America as a whole.\"\n\nDiscussions on anti-Americanism have in most cases lacked a precise explanation of what the sentiment entails (other than a general disfavor), which has led to the term being used broadly and in an impressionistic manner, resulting in the inexact impressions of the many expressions described as anti-American. Author and expatriate William Russell Melton described that criticism for the United States largely originates from the perception that the U.S. wants to act as a \"world policeman.\"\n\nNegative or critical views of the United States' influence have increased in recent years in Russia, the Middle East, Latin America, North Korea, Iran, Turkey, as well as in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, but remains low in Vietnam, Israel, the Philippines, and South Korea.\nIn the online Oxford Dictionary the term \"anti-American\" is defined as \"hostile to the interests of the United States\".\n\nIn the first edition of Webster's American Dictionary of the English Language (1828) the term \"anti-American\" was defined as \"opposed to America, or to the true interests or government of the United States; opposed to the revolution in America\". In France the use of the noun form 'antiaméricanisme' has been catalogued from 1948, entering ordinary political language in the 1950s.\n\nA poll conducted by the BBC World Service of 19 countries, 4 countries rated U.S. influence positively, while 14 leaned negatively, and 1 was divided.\n\nInterpretations of anti-Americanism have often been polarized. Anti-Americanism has been described by Hungarian-born American sociologist Paul Hollander as \"a relentless critical impulse toward American social, economic, and political institutions, traditions, and values\".\n\nGerman newspaper publisher and political scientist Josef Joffe suggests five classic aspects of the phenomenon: reducing Americans to stereotypes, believing the United States to have an irremediably evil nature, ascribing to the U.S. establishment a vast conspiratorial power aimed at utterly dominating the globe, holding the United States responsible for all the evils in the world, and seeking to limit the influence of the United States by destroying it or by cutting oneself and one's society off from its polluting products and practices. Other advocates of the significance of the term argue that anti-Americanism represents a coherent and dangerous ideological current, comparable to anti-Semitism. Anti-Americanism has also been described as an attempt to frame the consequences of U.S. policy choices as evidence of a specifically U.S. moral failure, as opposed to what may be unavoidable failures of a complicated foreign policy that comes with superpower status.\n\nIts status as an \"-ism\" is a greatly contended suspect, however. Brendon O'Connor notes that studies of the topic have been \"patchy and impressionistic,\" and often one-sided attacks on anti-Americanism as an irrational position. American academic Noam Chomsky, a prolific critic of U.S. and its policies, asserts that the use of the term within the U.S. has parallels with methods employed by totalitarian states or military dictatorships; he compares the term to \"anti-Sovietism\", a label used by the Kremlin to suppress dissident or critical thought, for instance.\nThe concept \"anti-American\" is an interesting one. The counterpart is used only in totalitarian states or military dictatorships... Thus, in the old Soviet Union, dissidents were condemned as \"anti-Soviet\". That's a natural usage among people with deeply rooted totalitarian instincts, which identify state policy with the society, the people, the culture. In contrast, people with even the slightest concept of democracy treat such notions with ridicule and contempt.\n\nSome have attempted to recognize both positions. French academic Pierre Guerlain has argued that the term represents two very different tendencies: \"One systematic or essentialist, which is a form of prejudice targeting all Americans. The other refers to the way criticisms of the United States are labeled \"anti-American\" by supporters of U.S. policies in an ideological bid to discredit their opponents\". Guerlain argues that these two \"ideal types\" of anti-Americanism can sometimes merge, thus making discussion of the phenomenon particularly difficult. Other scholars have suggested that a plural of anti-Americanisms, specific to country and time period, more accurately describe the phenomenon than any broad generalization. The widely used \"anti-American sentiment\", meanwhile, less explicitly implies an ideology or belief system.\n\nGlobally, increases in perceived anti-American attitudes appear to correlate with particular policies or actions, such as the Vietnam and Iraq wars. For this reason, critics sometimes argue the label is a propaganda term that is used to dismiss any censure of the United States as irrational.\n\nIn the mid- to late-eighteenth century, a theory emerged among some European intellectuals that the New World landmasses were inherently inferior to Europe. The so-called \"degeneracy thesis\" held that climatic extremes, humidity and other atmospheric conditions in America physically weakened both men and animals. American author James W. Ceaser and French author Philippe Roger have interpreted this theory as \"a kind of prehistory of anti-Americanism\". and have (in the words of Philippe Roger) been a historical \"constant\" since the 18th century, or again an endlessly repetitive \"semantic block\". Others, like Jean-François Revel, have examined what lay hidden behind this 'fashionable' ideology. Purported evidence for the idea included the smallness of American fauna, dogs that ceased to bark, and venomous plants; one theory put forth was that the New World had emerged from the Biblical flood later than the Old World. Native Americans were also held to be feeble, small, and without ardor.\n\nThe theory originated with Comte de Buffon, a leading French naturalist, in his \"Histoire Naturelle\" (1766). The French writer Voltaire joined Buffon and others in making the argument. Dutchman Cornelius de Pauw, court philosopher to Frederick II of Prussia became its leading proponent. While Buffon focused on the American biological environment, de Pauw attacked people native to the continent. James Ceaser has noted that the denouncement of America as inferior to Europe was in part motivated by the German government's fear of mass emigration; de Pauw was called on to convince the Germans that the new world was inferior. De Pauw is also known to have influenced the philosopher Immanuel Kant in a similar direction.\n\nDe Pauw said that the New World was unfit for human habitation because it was, \"so ill-favored by nature that all it contains is either degenerate or monstrous\". He asserted that, \"the earth, full of putrefacation, was flooded with lizards, snakes, serpents, reptiles and insects\". Taking a long-term perspective he announced that he was, \"certain that the conquest of the New World...has been the greatest of all misfortunes to befall mankind\".\n\nThe theory made it easy to argue that the natural environment of the United States would prevent it from ever producing true culture. Echoing de Pauw, the French Encyclopedist Abbé Raynal wrote in 1770, \"America has not yet produced a good poet, an able mathematician, one man of genius in a single art or a single science\". The theory was debated and rejected by early American thinkers such as Alexander Hamilton, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson; Jefferson, in his \"Notes on the State of Virginia\" (1781), provided a detailed rebuttal of de Buffon from a scientific point of view. Hamilton also vigorously rebuked the idea in Federalist No. 11 (1787).\n\nOne critic, citing Raynal's ideas, suggests that it was specifically extended to the English colonies that would become the United States.\n\nRoger suggests that the idea of degeneracy posited a symbolic, as well as a scientific, America that would evolve beyond the original thesis. He argues that Buffon's ideas formed the root of a \"stratification of negative discourses\" that has recurred throughout the two countries' relationship (and has been matched by persistent anti-Gallic sentiment in the United States).\n\nAccording to Brendan O'Connor, some Europeans criticized Americans for lacking \"taste, grace and civility\" and having a brazen and arrogant character. British author Frances Trollope observed in her 1832 book \"Domestic Manners of the Americans\" that the greatest difference between England and the United States was \"want of refinement\", explaining \"that polish which removes the coarser and rougher parts of our nature is unknown and undreamed of\" in America. According to one source her account \"succeeded in angering Americans more than any book written by a foreign observer before or since\". English writer Captain Marryat's critical account in his \"Diary in America, with Remarks on Its Institutions\" (1839) also proved controversial, especially in Detroit where an effigy of the author, along with his books, was burned. Other writers critical of American culture and manners included the bishop Talleyrand in France and Charles Dickens in England. Dickens' novel \"Martin Chuzzlewit\" (1844) is a ferocious satire on American life.\n\nSimon Schama says: \"By the end of the nineteenth century, the stereotype of the ugly American – voracious, preachy, mercenary, and bombastically chauvinist – was firmly in place in Europe\". O'Connor suggests that such prejudices were rooted in an idealised image of European refinement and that the notion of high European culture pitted against American vulgarity has not disappeared.\n\nThe young United States also faced criticism on political and ideological grounds. Ceaser argues that the Romantic strain of European thought and literature, hostile to the Enlightenment view of reason and obsessed with history and national character, disdained the rationalistic American project. The German poet Nikolaus Lenau commented: \"With the expression \"Bodenlosigkeit\" (absence of ground), I think I am able to indicate the general character of all American institutions; what we call Fatherland is here only a property insurance scheme\". Ceaser argues in his essay that such comments often repurposed the language of degeneracy, and the prejudice came to focus solely on the United States and not Canada and Mexico. Lenau had emigrated to the United States in 1833 and found that the country did not live up to his ideals, leading him to return to Germany the following year. His experiences in the USA were the subject of a novel entitled \"Tired of America\" (\"Der Amerika-Müde\") (1855) by fellow German Ferdinand Kürnberger.\n\nThe nature of American democracy was also questioned. The sentiment was that the country lacked \"[a] monarch, aristocracy, strong traditions, official religion, or rigid class system,\" according to Rubin, and its democracy was attacked by some Europeans in the early nineteenth century as degraded, a travesty, and a failure. The French Revolution, which was loathed by many European conservatives, also implicated the United States and the idea of creating a constitution on abstract and universal principles. That the country was intended to be a bastion of liberty was also seen as fraudulent given that it had been established with slavery. \"How is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of negroes?\" asked Samuel Johnson in 1775. He famously stated that, \"I am willing to love all mankind, except an American\".\n\nSigmund Freud was vehemently anti-American. Historian Peter Gay says that in \"slashing away at Americans wholesale; quite indiscriminately, with imaginative ferocity, Freud was ventilating some inner need\". Gay suggests that Freud's anti-Americanism was not really about the United States at all.\n\nNumerous authors went on the attack. French writer Louis-Ferdinand Celine denounced the United States. German poet Rainer Marie Rilke wrote, \"I no longer love Paris, partly because it is disfiguring and Americanizing itself\".\n\nUntil its demise in 1991, the Soviet Union and other Communist nations emphasized capitalism as the great enemy of Communism, and identified the U.S. as the leader of the capitalist nations. They sponsored anti-Americanism of all kinds among followers and fellow travellers. Berman notes that in the mid-19th century, \"Marx himself largely admired the dynamism of American capitalism and democracy and did not participate in the anti-Americanism that came to be the hallmark of Communist ideology in the twentieth century\". O'Connor argues that, \"communism represented the starkest version of anti-Americanism – a coherent worldview that challenged the free market, private property, limited government, and individualism\".\n\nAuthors in the west, such as Bertolt Brecht and Jean-Paul Sartre went on the attack and reached a large audience on the far left. In his \"Anti-Americanism\" (2003), French writer Jean François Revel argues that anti-Americanism emerges primarily from anti-capitalism, and this critique also comes from non-Communist, totalitarian regimes.\nThe East German regime imposed an official ideology that was reflected in all its media and all the schools. Anyone who indicated the least deviation invited a visit from the Stasi (secret police). The official line followed Lenin's theory of imperialism as the highest and last stage of capitalism, and in Dimitrov's theory of fascism as the dictatorship of the most reactionary elements of financial capitalism. The official party line stated that the United States had caused the breakup of the coalition against Hitler. It was now the bulwark of reaction worldwide, with a heavy reliance on warmongering for the benefit of the \"terrorist international of murderers on Wall Street\".\n\nEast Germans were told they had a heroic role to play as a front-line against the evil Americans. However Schnoor argues that few East Germans believed it. They had seen enough of the Russians since 1945—a half-million Soviet troops were still stationed in East Germany as late as 1989. Furthermore, they were exposed to information from relatives in the West, as well as the American Radio Free Europe broadcasts, and West German media. The official Communist media ridiculed the modernism and cosmopolitanism of American culture, and denigrated the features of the American way of life, especially jazz music and rock 'n roll. The East German regime relied heavily on its tight control of youth organizations to rally them, with scant success, against American popular culture. The older generations were more concerned with the poor quality of food, housing, and clothing, which stood in dramatic contrast to the prosperity of West Germany. Professionals in East Germany were watched for any sign of deviation from the party line; their privileges were at risk. The solution was to either comply or flee to West Germany, which was relatively easy before the crackdown and the Berlin wall of 1961.\n\nDrawing on the ideas of Arthur de Gobineau (1816–1882), European fascists decried the supposed degenerating effect of immigration on the racial mix of the American population. The Nazi philosopher Alfred Rosenberg argued that race mixture in the United States made it inferior to countries like Germany, which had a supposedly pure-bred racial stock.\n\nAnti-Semitism was another factor in these critiques. The view that the U.S. was controlled by a Jewish conspiracy through a Jewish lobby was common in countries ruled by fascists before and during World War II. The Jews, the assumed puppet masters behind American plans for world domination, were also seen as using jazz in a crafty plan to eliminate racial distinctions; Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini did not count America as a credible adversary of the Third Reich because of its incoherent racial mix; they saw Americans as a \"mongrel race\", \"half-Judaised\" and \"half-Negrified\".\n\nIn an address to the Reichstag on 11 December 1941, Hitler declared war on the United States and lambasted U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt:\n\nThe \"Liberators\" poster distributed by Nazis in 1944 to a Dutch audience displays multiple elements of anti-American attitudes promoted by the Nazis. The title \"Liberators\" refers to a common Allied justification for attacking Germany (as well as the American B-24 Liberator bomber), and the poster depicts this \"liberation\" as the destruction of European cities. The artist was Harald Damsleth, a Norwegian who worked for the NS in occupied Norway.\n\nIn a book called \"The Rise of Anti-Americanism\", published in 2006, Brendon O'Connor and Martin Griffiths said that the September 11 attacks were \"quintessential anti-American acts, which satisfy all of the competing definitions of Anti-Americanism\". They ask, \"If 9/11 can be construed as the exemplar of anti-Americanism at work, does it make much sense to imply that all anti-Americans are complicit with terrorism?\" Most leaders in Islamic countries, including Afghanistan, condemned the attacks. Saddam Hussein's Iraq was a notable exception, with an immediate official statement that \"the American cowboys are reaping the fruit of their crimes against humanity\".\n\nEurope was highly sympathetic to the United States after the 9/11 attack. NATO unanimously supported the United States, treating an attack on the US as an attack on all of them after Article 5 of the NATO treaty was invoked for the very first (and, last) time. NATO and American troops entered Afghanistan ( despite various schedules for withdrawals and surges). When the United States decided to invade and overthrow the Iraqi regime in 2003, it won considerable support in Europe, especially from Britain, but also intense opposition, led by Germany and France. Konrad Jarausch argues that there was still fundamental agreement on such basic issues of support for democracy and human rights. However, there emerged a growing gap between an American \"libertarian, individualistic, market outlook, and the more statist, collectivist, welfare mentality in Europe.\"\n\nA growing dimension of anti-Americanism is fear of the pervasiveness of U.S. internet technology. This can be traced from the very first computers which were either British (Colossus) or German (Z1) through to the World Wide Web itself (invented by Englishman Tim Berners-Lee). In all these cases the U.S. has commercialized all these innovations.\n\nAmericanization has advanced through widespread high speed Internet and smart phone technology since 2008, With a large fraction of the new apps and hardware being designed in United States. In Europe, there is growing concern about excess Americanization through Google, Facebook, Twitter, the iPhone and Uber, among many other U.S. internet-based corporations. European governments have increasingly expressed concern regarding privacy issues, as well as antitrust and taxation issues regarding the new American giants. There is fear that they are significantly evading taxes, and posting information that may violate European privacy laws. The \"Wall Street Journal\" in 2015 reported \"deep concerns in Europe's highest policy circles about the power of U.S. technology companies.\"\n\nSometimes developments help neutralize anti-Americanism. In 2015, the United States Department of Justice went on the attack against corruption at FIFA, arresting many top world soccer leaders long suspected of bribery and corruption. In this case the U.S. government's self-defined role as \"policeman of the world\" won widespread international support.\n\nIn a 2003 article, historian David Ellwood identified what he called three great roots of anti-Americanism:\nHe went on to say that expressions of the phenomenon in the last 60 years have contained ever-changing combinations of these elements, the configurations depending on internal crises within the groups or societies articulating them as much as anything done by American society in all its forms.\n\nIn 2004, Sergio Fabbrini wrote that the perceived post-9/11 unilateralism of the 2003 invasion of Iraq fed deep rooted anti-American feeling in Europe, bringing it to the surface. In his article, he highlighted European fears surrounding the Americanization of the economy, culture and political process of Europe. Fabbrini in 2011 identified a cycle in anti-Americanism: modest in the 1990s, it grew explosively between 2003 and 2008, then declined after 2008. He sees the current version as related to images of American foreign policy-making as unrestrained by international institutions or world opinion. Thus it is the unilateral policy process and the arrogance of policy makers, not the specific policy decisions, that are decisive.\n\nDuring the George W. Bush administration, public opinion of America declined in most European countries. A Pew Global Attitudes Project poll showed \"favourable opinions\" of America between 2000 and 2006 dropping from 83% to 56% in the United Kingdom, from 62% to 39% in France, from 78% to 37% in Germany and from 50% to 23% in Spain. In Spain, unfavorable views of Americans rose from 30% in 2005 to 51% in 2006 and positive views of Americans dropped from 56% in 2005 to 37% in 2006.\nIn Europe in 2002, vandalism of American companies was reported in Athens, Zürich, Tbilisi, Moscow and elsewhere. In Venice, 8 to 10 masked individuals claiming to be anti-globalists attacked a McDonald's restaurant.\nIn Athens, at the demonstrations commemorating the 17 November Uprising there was a march toward the U.S. embassy to emphasize the U.S. backing of the Greek military junta of 1967–1974 attended by many people each year.\n\nRuth Hatlapa, a PhD candidate at the University of Augsburg, and Andrei S. Markovits, a professor of Political Science at the University of Michigan, describe President Obama's image as that of an angel – or more precisely, a rock star – in Europe in contrast to Bush's devilish image there; they argue, however, that \"Obamamania\" masks a deep-seated distrust and disdain of America.\n\nIn France, the term \"Anglo-Saxon\" often is used in expressions of anti-Americanism or Anglophobia. It also has had more nuanced uses in discussions by French writers on French decline, especially as an alternative model to which France should aspire, how France should adjust to its two most prominent global competitors, and how it should deal with social and economic modernization.\n\nIn the 1950s the Suez Crisis of 1956 caused dismay among the French right, which already was angry at the lack of American support during Dien Bien Phu in 1954. For the Socialists and Communists of the French left, it was the Vietnam War and U.S. imperialism that were the sources of resentment. Much later, the alleged weapons of mass destruction in Iraq affair certainly dirtied the previously favourable image. In 2008, 85% of the French people considered the American government and banks to be most liable for the Financial crisis of 2007–2010.\n\nIn her contribution to the seminal book \"Anti-Americanisms in World Politics\" edited by Peter Katzenstein and Robert Keohane in 2006, Sophie Meunier writes about French anti-Americanism. She contends that although it has a long history (older than the U.S. itself) and is the most easily recognizable anti-Americanism in Europe, it may not have had real policy consequences on the United States and thus may have been less damaging than more pernicious and invisible anti-Americanism in other countries.\n\nIn 2013, 33% of the French had a \"very unfavorable\" or \"somewhat unfavorable\" view of Americans and 36% viewed the U.S. in a \"very unfavorable\" or \"somewhat unfavorable\" light.\n\nRichard Kuisel, an American scholar, has explored how France partly embraced American consumerism while rejecting much of American values and power. He writes in 2013:\n\nGerman naval planners in the 1890–1910 era denounced the Monroe Doctrine as a self-aggrandizing legal pretension to dominate the West hemisphere. They were even more concerned with the possible American canal in Panama, because it would lead to full American hegemony in the Caribbean. The stakes were laid out in the German war aims proposed by the Navy in 1903: a \"firm position in the West Indies,\" a \"free hand in South America,\" and an official \"revocation of the Monroe Doctrine\" would provide a solid foundation for \"our trade to the West Indies, Central and South America.\"\n\nDuring the Cold War, anti-Americanism was the official government policy in East Germany, and dissenters were punished. In West Germany, anti-Americanism was the common position on the left, but the majority praised America as a protector against communism and a critical ally in rebuilding the nation. After reunification in 1990, the Communist Party in the East struggled on under a new name, \"Die Linke\", and maintained its old anti-American position. Today it warns that America is plotting to spoil Germany's friendly relationship with Russia. Germany's refusal to support the American war on Iraq in 2003 was often seen as a manifestation of anti-Americanism. Anti-Americanism had been muted on the right since 1945, but reemerged in the 21st century especially in the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party that began in opposition to European Union, and now has become both anti-American and anti-immigrant. Annoyance or distrust of the Americans was heightened in 2013 by revelations of American spying on top German officials, including Chancellor Merkel.\n\nAlthough the Dutch have generally held a favorable attitude toward America, there were negative currents in the aftermath of World War II as the Dutch blamed American policy for the loss of their colonies in Southeast Asia to Indonesia. They credit their rescue from the Nazis in 1944–45 to the Canadian Army. Postwar attitudes continued the perennial ambiguity of anti-Americanism: the love-hate relationship, or willingness to adopt American cultural patterns while at the same time voicing criticism of them. In the 1960s, anti-Americanism revived largely in reaction against the Vietnam War. Its major early advocates were non-party-affiliated, left-wing students, journalists, and intellectuals. Dutch public opinion polls (1975–83) indicate a stable attitude toward the United States; only 10% of the people were unswervingly anti-American. The most strident rhetoric came from the left wing of Dutch politics and can largely be attributed to the consequences of Dutch participation in NATO.\n\nRussia has a long history of Anti-Americanism, dating back to the early days of the Cold War. In some of the latest Russian population polls, United States and its allies, constantly top the list of \"greatest threats\". In 2013, 30% of Russians had a \"very unfavorable\" or \"somewhat unfavorable\" view of Americans and 40% viewed the U.S. in a \"very unfavorable\" or \"somewhat unfavorable\" light, up from 34% in 2012. Recent Polls from the Levada center survey shows that 71% of Russians have a negative or somewhat negative attitude to the U.S., up from 38% in 2013. It is the largest figure since the collapse of the USSR. In comparison to the 1990s the number of Russians unhappy with American policies at that time was only under 10%. In 2015, a new poll by the Levada center showed that 81% of Russians now hold unfavorable views of the United States, presumably as a result of U.S. and Western sanctions imposed against Russia because of the Ukrainian Crisis. Anti-Americanism in Russia is reportedly at its highest since the end of the Cold War. Sarah Mendelson argues that \"As part of a broad crackdown on dissent after the eruption of antigovernment protests in 2011, Putin has managed to close nearly all space [used by] independent, critical voices.\"\n\nAccording to a Pew Global Attitudes Project poll, during the George W. Bush administration \"favourable opinions\" of America between 2000 and 2006 fell from 83% to 56% in the United Kingdom.\n\nNews articles and blogs have discussed the negative experiences of Americans living in the United Kingdom.\n\nAnti-American sentiment has become more widespread in the United Kingdom following the Iraq War and War in Afghanistan.\n\nSome Irish Republicans generally viewed the United States as the successor of the British Empire. This position became most persistent when Republicanism became dominated by socialists during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Irish Republican support for Palestinian Statehood, Arab Socialism, Latin American and African left-wing liberation movements and Serbia's claim over Kosovo as well as America's special relationship with the United Kingdom has been also been used to justify an anti-American stance. Anti-American sentiment has also increased among the general public since the 2003 Invasion of Iraq and the American military's usage of civilian facilities at Shannon Airport which potentially jeopardises Ireland's official neutrality stance.\n\nThe Australian Anti-Bases Campaign Coalition (AABCC) was formed on the basis of lobbying and protests that developed over the years from the 1960s when the majority of U.S. bases in Australia were established. It was founded by the New South Wales branch of the PND (People For Nuclear Disarmament). In 1974, several hundred people travelled to North West Cape from around Australia to protest and occupy the base. Anti-Americanism supposedly exists among school teachers in Australia, which has been condemned by conservative politicians. In August 2005, Treasurer Peter Costello condemned anti-American sentiment by teachers and criticised the teaching of history in Australian schools.\n\nAccording to an article published by \"The Monthly\" magazine, Australians muttered stories about George W. Bush over glasses of beer and despaired of neoconservatism in coffee shops, lamenting the so-called Ugly American activities. According to the same article, Rupert Murdoch, an American who had renounced his Australian citizenship over two decades prior, said during a November 2006 visit to Australia that \"he was worried about a \"regrettable\" anti-American sentiment in Australia.\" In a poll taken by U.S. magazine \"Reader's Digest\" with 1000 Australians, 15 percent of Australians described themselves as \"anti-American\". Another 67 percent held neutral views of America, and 17 percent said they were \"pro-American\". In the survey, 71 percent of Australians said they would not like to live in the US.\n\nIn China, there has been a history of anti-Americanism, beginning with the general disdain for foreigners in the early 19th century that culminated in the Boxer Rebellion of 1900, which the US military participated in.\n\nDuring the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II, the US provided economic and military assistance to the Chiang Kai-shek regime against the Japanese invasion. In particular, the China Hands, American diplomats known for their knowledge of China, also attempted to establish diplomatic contacts with Mao Zedong's communists in their stronghold in Yan'an, with a goal of fostering unity between the Nationalists and Communists. However, relations soured after communist victory in the Chinese Civil War and the relocation of the Chiang regime to Taiwan, together with the start of the Cold War and rise of McCarthyism in US politics. While the US initially expected the Chiang regime to quickly fall, China and the US fought a major undeclared war in Korea, 1950–53, and as a result, President Harry S. Truman began advocating a policy of containment and sent the United States Seventh Fleet to deter a possible communist invasion of the island. The US signed the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty with Taiwan, which lasted until 1979, and during this period, the communist government in Beijing was not diplomatically recognized by the US. By 1950, virtually all American diplomatic staff had left mainland China, and one of Mao's political goals was to identify and destroy factions inside China that might be favorable to capitalism.\n\nMao initially ridiculed the U.S. as a \"paper tiger,\" occupiers of Taiwan, \"the enemy of the people of the world and has increasingly isolated itself\" and \"monopoly capitalist groups\", and it was argued that Mao never intended on friendly relations with the U.S. However, due to the Sino-Soviet split and increasing tension between China and the Soviet Union, US President Richard Nixon signaled a diplomatic reapproachement with communist China, and embarked on an official visit in 1972. Diplomatic relations between the two countries were eventually restored in 1979. After Mao's death, Deng Xiaoping embarked on economic reforms, and hostility diminished sharply, while large-scale trade and investments, as well as cultural exchanges became major factors. Following the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the US placed economic and military sanctions upon China, although official diplomatic relations continued.\nAnti-American and Chinese nationalist sentiments surged following the Yinhe incident of 1993, where a Chinese ship was detained by the US Navy in international waters, allegedly containing chemical components headed for Iran, but was eventually cleared after months of inspection. The Third Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1996 has led Chinese officials to be concerned about a supposed China containment policy, and began viewing the United States as responsible for major issues that arise in the bilateral relationship between China and Taiwan, as they believe that American support of Taiwan is an effort to weaken their country. During this time, there is also a sense of disillusionment with the US among Chinese intellectuals, and popular books such as China Can Say No criticized US foreign policy towards China and promoted grassroots Chinese nationalism. Relations became severely strained by the U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in May 1999, which was blamed on an intelligence error but which some Chinese believed to be deliberate. The bombing, alongside the perceived lack of apology from the US, led to mass protests in Beijing and other major Chinese cities. In 2001, diplomatic relations were further damaged by the Hainan Island incident, where a collision between an US and Chinese aircraft resulted in the death of the Chinese pilot and detainment of the 24 American crew.\n\nThe election of US President Barack Obama in 2008 also signified a shift in American foreign policy towards China, and then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for a \"Pivot to Asia\", or rebalancing of US strategic and economic interests in East Asia, specifically freedom of navigation patrols in the South China Sea. This move is widely seen as attempts to counter Chinese interests in the region, and in response, the Chinese military began their own buildup in the region, such as the creation of its own Air Defense Identification Zone. Recently, in 2009, Luo Ping, a director-general at the China Banking Regulatory Commission, criticized America's laissez-faire capitalism and said that he hated America when the United States Treasury would start to print money and depreciate the value of the U.S. dollar, thus cheapening the value of China's purchase of U.S. bonds. Chinese hackers have also conducted extensive cyberwarfare against American institutions and citizens targeting the U.S. and its Western allies. Furthermore, China's leaders present their country as an alternative to the meddling power of the West. In 2013, 54% of the Chinese had a \"very unfavorable\" or \"somewhat unfavorable\" view of Americans and 53% viewed the U.S. in a \"very unfavorable\" or \"somewhat unfavorable\" light.\n\nWhile the Chinese government officially condemned the September 11 attacks, privately there was a considerable number of Chinese citizens (mostly Chinese nationalists) who celebrated news of the terrorist attacks on U.S. targets. This was not the case in all of China, and in fact, tens of thousands of people visited the U.S. Embassy after the 9/11 attacks, leaving flowers, cards, funeral wreaths and hand-written notes of condolence on the pavement outside.\n\nAnalysts have argued that certain Hollywood films such as \"Django Unchained\" were allowed to slip past China's film censorship regime, as they depicted a negative view of American society. \"The film depicts one of America's darker periods, when slavery was legal, which Chinese officials like to use to push back against criticism from the United States\".\n\nIn Japan, objections to the behavior and presence of American military personnel are sometimes reported as anti-Americanism, such as the 1995 Okinawa rape incident. The ongoing U.S. military presence in Okinawa remains a contentious issue in Japan.\n\nWhile protests have arisen because of specific incidents, they are often reflective of deeper historical resentments. Robert Hathaway, director of the Wilson Center's Asia program, suggests: \"The growth of anti-American sentiment in both Japan and South Korea must be seen not simply as a response to American policies and actions, but as reflective of deeper domestic trends and developments within these Asian countries\". In Japan, a variety of threads have contributed to anti-Americanism in the post-war era, including pacifism on the left, nationalism on the right, and opportunistic worries over American influence in Japanese economic life.\n\nSpeaking to the Wilson Center, Katharine Moon notes that while the majority of South Koreans support the American alliance \"anti-Americanism also represents the collective venting of accumulated grievances that in many instances have lain hidden for decades\". In the 1990s, scholars, policy makers, and the media noted that anti-Americanism was motivated by the rejection of authoritarianism and a resurgent nationalism, this nationalist anti-Americanism continued into the 2000s fuelled by a number of incidents such as the 'IMF' crisis. During the early 1990s, Western princess, prostitutes for American soldiers became a symbol of anti-American nationalism.\n\n\"Dear American\" is an anti-American song sung by Psy. \"Fucking USA\" is an anti-American protest song written by South Korean singer and activist Yoon Min-suk. Strongly anti-U.S. foreign policy and anti-Bush, the song was written in 2002 at a time when, following the Apolo Ohno Olympic controversy and an incident in Yangju in which two Korean middle school students were killed under the wheels of a U.S. Army vehicle, anti-American sentiment in South Korea reached high levels. However, by 2009, a majority of South Koreans were reported as having a favorable view of the United States. In 2014, 58% of South Koreans had a favorable view of the U.S., making South Korea one of the world's most pro-American countries.\n\nRelations between North Korea and the United States are currently hostile, largely due to the aftermath of the Korean War, as well its more recent development of nuclear weapons and long range missiles. The US currently maintain a military presence in South Korea, and President George W. Bush had previously described North Korea as part of the \"Axis of Evil\".\n\nIn North Korea, July is the \"Month of Joint Anti-American Struggle,\" with festivities to denounce the U.S.\n\nAnti-American sentiment has existed in the Philippines, owing to primarily the Philippine–American War of more than 100 years ago, and the 1898–1946 period of American colonial rule. In the modern day, the controversial Visiting Forces Agreement provides an extra means of anti-American sentiment in the country; especially among Muslim Filipinos\n\nIn October 2012, American ships were found dumping toxic wastes into Subic Bay, spurring anti-Americanism and setting the stage for multiple rallies. When U.S. president Barack Obama toured Asia, in mid to late April 2014 to visit Malaysia, South Korea, Japan, and the Philippines, hundreds of Filipino protests demonstrated in Manila shouting anti-Obama slogans, with some even burning mock U.S. flags.\n\nHowever, despite these incidents, a poll conducted in 2011 by the BBC found that 90% of Filipinos have a favorable view of the U.S., higher than the view of the U.S. in any other country. According to a Pew Research Center Poll released in 2014, 92% of Filipinos viewed the U.S. favorably, making the Philippines the most pro-American nation in the world.\n\nDrone strikes have led to growing anti-Americanism.\n\nNegative attitudes toward the U.S.'s influence on the world has risen in Pakistan as a result of U.S. drone attacks on the country introduced by George W. Bush and continued by Barack Obama. In a poll surveying opinions toward the United States, Pakistan scored as the most negatively aligned nation, jointly alongside Serbia.\n\nAfter World War I, admiration was expressed for American President Woodrow Wilson's promulgation of democracy, freedom and self-determination in the Fourteen Points and, during World War II, the high ideals of the Atlantic Charter received favorable notice. According to Tamim Ansary, in \"Destiny Disrupted: A History of the World Through Islamic Eyes\" (2009) early views of America in the Middle East and the Muslim World were mostly positive.\n\nLike elsewhere in the world, spikes in anti-Americanism in the region correlate with the adoption or reiteration of certain policies by the U.S. government, in special its support for Israel in the occupation of Palestine and the Iraq War. In regards to 9/11, a Gallup poll noted, for example, that while some (3%) Muslims polled opposed the attack, 97% of them (called 'radicals' in the survey) supported it, citing in their favor, not religious view points, but disgust at U.S. policies. In effect, when targeting U.S. or other Western assets in the region, radical armed groups in the Middle East, Al-Qaeda included, have made reference to U.S. policies and alleged crimes against humanity to justify their attacks. For example, to explain the Khobar Towers bombing (in which 19 American airmen were killed), Bin Laden, although proven to have not committed the attack, named U.S. support for Israel in instances of attacks against Muslims, such as the Sabra and Shatila massacre and the Qana massacre, as the reasons behind the attack.\n\nAl-Qaeda also cited the U.S. sanctions on and bombing of Iraq in the Iraqi no-fly zones (1991–2003), which exacted a large toll in the Arab country's civilian population, as a justification to kill Americans.\n\nAlthough right-wing scholars (e.g. Paul Hollander) have given prominence to the role that religiosity, culture and backwardness play in inflaming anti-Americanism in the region, the poll noted that radicalism among Arabs or Muslims isn't correlated with poverty, backwardness or religiosity. Radicals were in fact shown to be better educated and wealthier than 'moderates'.\n\nThere is also, however, a cultural dimension to anti-Americanism among religious and conservative groups in the Middle East. It may have its origins with Sayyid Qutb. Qutb, an Egyptian who was the leading intellectual of the Muslim Brotherhood, studied in Greeley, Colorado from 1948 to 1950, and wrote a book, \"The America I Have Seen\" (1951) based on his impressions. In it he decried everything in America from individual freedom and taste in music to Church socials and haircuts. Wrote Qutb, \"They danced to the tunes of the gramophone, and the dance floor was replete with tapping feet, enticing legs, arms wrapped around waists, lips pressed to lips, and chests pressed to chests. The atmosphere was full of desire...\" He offered a distorted chronology of American history and was disturbed by its sexually liberated women: \"The American girl is well acquainted with her body's seductive capacity. She knows it lies in the face, and in expressive eyes, and thirsty lips. She knows seductiveness lies in the round breasts, the full buttocks, and in the shapely thighs, sleek legs – and she shows all this and does not hide it\". He was particularly disturbed by jazz, which he called the American's preferred music, and which \"was created by Negroes to satisfy their love of noise and to whet their sexual desires ...\" Qutb's writings influenced generations of militants and radicals in the Middle East who viewed America as a cultural temptress bent on overturning traditional customs and morals, especially with respect to the relations between the sexes.\n\nQutb's ideas influenced Osama Bin Laden, an anti-American Islamic militant from Saudi Arabia, who was the founder of the Jihadist organization Al-Qaeda. In conjunction with several other Islamic militant leaders, bin Laden issued two fatawa – in 1996 and then again in 1998 – that Muslims should kill military personnel and civilians of the United States until the United States government withdraw military forces from Islamic countries and withdraw support for Israel.\n\nAfter the 1996 fatwa, entitled \"Declaration of War against the Americans Occupying the Land of the Two Holy Places\", bin Laden was put on a criminal file by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) under an American Civil War statute which forbids instigating violence and attempting to overthrow the U.S. government. He has also been indicted in United States federal court for his alleged involvement in the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and Nairobi, Kenya, and was on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list. On 14 January 2009, bin Laden vowed to continue the fight and open up new fronts against the U.S. on behalf of the Islamic world.\n\nIn 2002 and in mid-2004 Zogby International polled the favorable/unfavorable ratings of the U.S. in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). In Zogby's 2002 survey, 76% of Egyptians had a negative attitude toward the United States, compared with 98% in 2004. In Morocco, 61% viewed the country unfavorably in 2002, but in two years, that number had jumped to 88 percent. In Saudi Arabia, such responses rose from 87% in 2002 to 94% in 2004. Attitudes were virtually unchanged in Lebanon but improved slightly in the UAE, from 87% who said in 2002 that they disliked the United States to 73% in 2004. However, most of these countries mainly objected to foreign policies that they considered unfair.\n\nThe chant \"Death to America\" (Persian: مرگ بر آمریکا) has been in use in Iran since at least the Iranian revolution in 1979, along with other phrases often represented as anti-American. A 1953 coup which involved the CIA was cited as a grievance. State-sponsored murals characterised as anti-American dot the streets of Tehran. It has been suggested that under Ayatollah Khomeini anti-Americanism was little more than a way to distinguish between domestic supporters and detractors, and even the phrase \"Great Satan\" which has previously been associated with anti-Americanism, appears to now signify either the United States or the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Iran hostage crisis that lasted from 1979 to 1981, in which fifty-two Americans were held hostage in Tehran for 444 days, was also a demonstration of anti-Americanism, one which considerably worsened mutual perceptions between the U.S. and Iran.\n\nAnti-Americanism is felt very strongly in Jordan and has been on the rise since at least 2003. Despite the fact that Jordan is one of America's closest allies in the Middle East and the Government of Jordan is pro-American and pro-Western, the anti-Americanism of Jordanians is among the highest in the world. Anti-Americanism rose dramatically after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, when the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and many other allies, invaded Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein from power. According to several Pew Research Attitudes polls conducted since 2003, 99% of Jordanians viewed the U.S. unfavorably and 82% of Jordanians viewed American people unfavorably. Although 2017 data indicates negative attitudes towards the U.S. and American people have gone down to 82% and 61% respectively, rates of anti-Americanism in Jordan are still amongst the highest in the world.\n\nIn July 2013, Palestinian Cleric Ismat Al-Hammouri, a leader of the Jerusalem-based Hizb ut-Tahrir, called for the destruction of America, France, Britain and Rome to conquer and destroy the enemies of the \"Nation of Islam\". He warned: \"We warn you, oh America: Take your hands off the Muslims. You have wreaked havoc in Syria, and before that, in Afghanistan and in Iraq, and now in Egypt,\" shouted the cleric to the enthusiastic replies of the crowd. \"Who do you think we are, America? We are the nation of Islam — a giant and mighty nation, which extends from east to west. Soon, we will teach you a political and military lesson, Allah willing. Allah Akbar. All glory to Allah\". Al-Hammouri also warned U.S. president Barack Obama that there is an impending rise of a united Muslim empire that will instill religious law on all of its subjects.\n\nAnti-Americanism in Palestine originates from an opposition to longstanding U.S. support of Israel.\n\nIn Turkey, in 2009, anti-American protestors held signs saying \"Obama, new president of the American imperialism that is the enemy of the world's people, your hands are also bloody. Get out of our country.\" when Barack Obama visited Turkey. Protestors also shouted phrases such as \"Yankee go home\" and \"Obama go home\".\n\nIn 2009 Ozgur Taskaya stated that the root of secular anti-Americanism in Turkey lay within the conspiracy theories about the USA.\n\nAll the countries of the western hemisphere (including Canada, the United States of America, and a region known as Latin America) are often referred to as \"The Americas.\" In the U.S. generally and often outside it, the term \"America\" and \"American\" in ordinary parlance in the modern era refers only to the United States of America and its citizens. In the 1890s Cuban writer José Martí in an essay, \"Our America,\" alludes to his objection to this usage.\n\nIn Latin America anti-American sentiment has deep roots and is a key element of the concept of Latin American identity, \"specifically anti-U.S. expansionism and Catholic anti-Protestantism.\" An 1828 exchange between William Henry Harrison, the U.S. minister plenipotentiary rebuked President Simón Bolívar of Gran Colombia, saying \"... the strongest of all governments is that which is most free\", calling on Bolívar to encourage the development of a democracy. In response, Bolívar wrote, \"The United States ... seem destined by Providence to plague America with torments in the name of freedom\", a phrase that achieved fame in Latin America.\n\nIn the 1836 Texas Revolution, the Mexican province of Texas seceded from Mexico and nine years later, encouraged by the Monroe Doctrine and manifest destiny, the United States annexed the Republic of Texas – at its request, but against vehement opposition by Mexico, which refused to recognize Texas' independence – and began their aggressive expansion into Western North America. Mexican anti-American sentiment was further inflamed by the resulting 1846–1848 Mexican–American War, in which Mexico lost more than half of its territory to the United States.\n\nThe Chilean writer Francisco Bilbao predicted in \"America in Danger\" (1856) that the loss of Texas and northern Mexico to \"the talons of the eagle\" was just a foretaste of an American bid for world domination. An early exponent of the concept of Latin America, Bilbao excluded Brazil and Paraguay from it, as well as Mexico, because \"Mexico lacked a real republican consciousness, precisely because of its complicated relationship with the United States.\" Interventions by the US prompted a later ruler of Mexico, Porfirio Diaz, to lament \"Poor Mexico, so far from God, and so close to the United States\". Mexico's National Museum of Interventions, opened in 1981, is a testament to Mexico's sense of grievance with the United States.\n\nThe 1855 American intervention in Nicaragua and the Spanish–American War of 1898, which turned Cuba's war of independence from Spain into US expansionism, making Cuba into a virtual dependency of the United States via the Platt Amendment to the Cuban constitution. The US action is consistent with the Big Stick ideology espoused by Theodore Roosevelt's corollary to the Monroe Doctrine that led to numerous interventions in Central America and the Caribbean, also prompted hatred of the U.S. in other regions of the Americas. A very influential formulation of Latin-American anti-Americanism, engendered by the 1898 war, was the Uruguayan journalist José Enrique Rodó's essay \"Ariel\" (1900) in which the spiritual values of the South American Ariel are contrasted to the brutish mass-culture of the American Caliban. This essay had enormous influence throughout Spanish America in the 1910s and 1920s, and prompted resistance to what was seen as American cultural imperialism. Perceived racist attitudes of the White Anglo-Saxon Protestants of the North toward the populations of Latin America also caused resentment.\n\nThe Student Reform that began in the University of Cordoba (Argentina) in 1918 boosted the idea of anti-imperialism throughout Latin America and played a fundamental role for launch the concept to be developed over several generations. Already in 1920 the Federación Universitaria Argentina issued a manifesto titled \"Denunciation of the imperialism\".\n\nSince the 1940s, the relations with Argentina have been tense, when the U.S. feared regime of General Peron was too close to Nazi Germany. In 1954, American support for the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'état against the democratically elected President Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán fueled anti-Americanism in the region. This CIA-sponsored coup prompted a former president of that country, Juan José Arévalo to write a fable entitled \"The Shark and the Sardines\" (1961) in which a predatory shark (representing the United States) overawes the sardines of Latin America.\n\nVice-President Richard Nixon's tour of South America in 1958 prompted a spectacular eruption of anti-Americanism. The tour became the focus of violent protests which climaxed in Caracas, Venezuela where Nixon was almost killed by a raging mob as his motorcade drove from the airport to the city. In response, President Dwight D. Eisenhower assembled troops at Guantanamo Bay and a fleet of battleships in the Caribbean to intervene to rescue Nixon if necessary. \n\nFidel Castro, the late revolutionary leader of Cuba, tried throughout his career to co-ordinate long-standing Latin American resentments against the USA through military and propagandist means. He was aided in this goal by the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba in 1961, planned and implemented by the American government against his regime. This disaster ruined American credibility in the Americas and gave a boost to her critics worldwide. According to Rubin and Rubin, Castro's Second Declaration of Havana, in February 1962, \"constituted a declaration of war on the United States and the enshrinement of a new theory of anti-Americanism\". Castro called America \"a vulture...feeding on humanity\". The United States embargo against Cuba maintained resentment and Castro's colleague, the famed revolutionary Che Guevara, expressed his hopes during the Vietnam War of \"creating a Second or a Third Vietnam\" in the Latin American region against the designs of what he believed to be U.S. imperialism.\nMany subsequent U.S. interventions against democracy, support for military dictatorships, and mass murder campaigns in the region solidified Latin American anti-Americanism. These include 1964 Brazilian coup d'état, the invasion of the Dominican Republic in 1965, U.S. involvement in Operation Condor, the 1973 Chilean and 1976 Argentine coups d'état, and the Salvadoran Civil War, the support of the Contras, the training of future military men, subsequently seen as war criminals, in the School of the Americas and the refusal to extradite a convicted terrorist, U.S. support for dictators such as Chilean Augusto Pinochet, Nicaraguan Anastasio Somoza, Haitian Duvalier, Brazilian Emílio Garrastazu Médici, Paraguyan Alfredo Stroessner and pre-1989 Panamanian Manuel Noriega.\n\nMany Latin Americans perceived that neo-liberalism reforms were failures in 1980s and the 1990s and intensified their opposition to the Washington consensus. This led to a resurgence in support for Pan-Americanism, support for popular movements in the region, the nationalisation of key industries and centralisation of government. America's tightening of the economic embargo on Cuba in 1996 and 2004 also caused resentment amongst Latin American leaders and prompted them to use the Rio Group and the Madrid-based Ibero-American Summits as meeting places rather than the United States-dominated OAS. This trend has been reinforced through the creation of a series of regional political bodies such as Unasur and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, and a strong opposition to the materialisation of the Washington-sponsored Free Trade Area of the Americas at the 2005 4th Summit of the Americas.\n\nPolls compiled by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs showed in 2006 Argentine public opinion was quite negative regarding America's role in the world. Argentine public opinion of the U.S. and U.S. policies improved during the Obama administration, and was divided about evenly (42% to 41%) between those who viewed these favorably or unfavorably. In 2007, 26% of Argentines had a favourable view of the American people, with 57% having an unfavourable view, but this improved somewhat in 2013, with 38% having a favourable view and 40% having an unfavourable view.\n\nFurthermore, the renewal of the concession for the U.S. military base in Manta, Ecuador was met by considerable criticism, derision, and even doubt by the supporters of such an expansion. The near-war sparked by the 2008 Andean diplomatic crisis was expressed by a high-level Ecuadorean military officer as being carried under American auspices. The officer said \"a large proportion of senior officers,\" share \"the conviction that the United States was an accomplice in the attack\" (launched on by the Colombian military on a FARC camp in Ecuador, near the Colombian border). The Ecuadorean military retaliated by stating the 10-year lease on the base, which expired in November 2009, would not be renewed and that the U.S. military presence was expected to be scaled down starting three months before the expiration date.\n\nIn 2015, the Obama administration signed an executive order which imposed targeted sanctions on seven Venezuelan officials whom the White House argued were instrumental in human rights violations, persecution of political opponents and significant public corruption and said that the country posed an \"unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.\" Nicolás Maduro responded to the sanctions in a couple of ways. He wrote an open letter in a full page ad in \"The New York Times\" in March 2015, stating that Venezuelans were \"friends of the American people\" and called President Obama's action of making targeted sanctions on the alleged human rights abusers a \"unilateral and aggressive measure\". Examples of accusations of human rights abuses from the United States to Maduro's government included the murder of a political activist prior to legislative elections in Venezuela.\n\nMaduro threatened to sue the United States over an executive order issued by the Obama Administration that declared Venezuela to be a threat to American security. He also planned to deliver 10 million signatures, denouncing the United States' decree declaring the situation in Venezuela an \"extraordinary threat to US national security\". and ordered all schools in the country to hold an \"anti-imperialist day\" against the United States with the day's activities including the \"collection of the signatures of the students, and teaching, administrative, maintenance and cooking personnel\". Maduro further ordered state workers to apply their signatures in protest, with some workers reporting that firings of state workers occurred due to their rejection of signing the executive order protesting the \"Obama decree\". There were also reports that members of Venezuelan armed forces and their families were ordered to sign against the United States decree.\n\nAnti-Americanism in Canada has unique historic roots. When the Continental Congress was called in 1774, an invitation was sent to Quebec and Nova Scotia. However Canadians expressed little interest in joining the Congress, and the following year the U.S. Military invaded Canada, but was defeated at the Battle of Quebec. Although the American Articles of Confederation later pre-approved Canada as a U.S. state, public opinion had turned against them. Soon 40,000 loyalist refugees arrived from the United States, including 2,000 Black Loyalists, many of whom had fought for the Crown against the American Revolution. To them, the republic they left behind was violent and anarchic, ruled by money and mob rule.\n\nPro-British imperialists repeatedly warned against American-style republicanism and democracy as little more than mob rule.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Canadian textbooks portrayed the United States in a negative fashion. It had abandoned the British Empire and as a results was disorderly, greedy, and selfishly individualistic. By the 1930s, there was less concern with the United States, and more attention given to Canada's peaceful society, and its heroic efforts on behalf of Civilization in the World War. Close cooperation in the Second World War led to much more favorable image. In the 1945-1965 era, the friendly and peaceful border was stressed. Textbooks emphasized the role of the United States as an international power and champion of freedom with Canada as its influential partner.\n\nIn 1945-65, there was wide consensus in Canada on foreign and defense policies 1948 to 1957. Bothwell, Drummond and English state:\n\nHowever the consensus did not last. By 1957 the Suez crisis alienated Canada from both Britain and France; politicians distrusted American leadership, businessmen questioned American financial investments; and intellectuals ridiculed the values of American television and Hollywood offerings that all Canadians watched. \"Public support for Canada's foreign policy big came unstuck. Foreign-policy, from being a winning issue for the Liberals, was fast becoming a losing one.\" Apart from the far left, which admired the USSR, anti-Americanism was first adopted by a few leading historians. As the Cold War grew hotter after 1947, Harold Innis grew increasingly hostile to the United States. He warned repeatedly that Canada was becoming a subservient colony to its much more powerful southern neighbor. \"We are indeed fighting for our lives,\" he warned, pointing especially to the \"pernicious influence of American advertising...We can only survive by taking persistent action at strategic points against American imperialism in all its attractive guises.\" His anti-Americanism influenced some younger scholars, including Donald Creighton.\n\nAnti-Americanism, as a political tactic, was sometimes used by the Conservatives to attack the supposed Liberal Party affinity for Americans, as in the 1911 elections. Anti-Americanism thus remained a fixture in Canadian partisan politics, as employed by such leaders as prime minister John G. Diefenbaker in the 1950s. He was aided in his attacks by the prominent historian Donald Creighton, who also wrote \"The Take-Over\" (1978), a novel about an American takeover.\n\nCanadian intellectuals who wrote about the U.S. in the first half of the 20th century identified the United States as the world centre of modernity, and deplored it. Imperialists explained that Canadians had narrowly escaped American conquest, with its rejection of tradition, its worship of \"progress\" and technology, and its mass culture; they explained that Canada was much better because of its commitment to orderly government and social harmony. There were a few ardent defenders of the nation to the south, notably liberal and socialist intellectuals such as F. R. Scott and Jean-Charles Harvey (1891–1967).\n\nBrendon O'Connor and Martin Griffiths state in their book \"Anti-Americanism\" that they would at first glance think that Canadians seem as likely as others to embrace characteristics that are characterised as anti-American. O'Conner and Griffiths include such actions as criticising Americans as a people, or the U.S. as a country as being anti-American often demonising, denigrating and resorting to stereotypes.\nThey have also written that the anti-Americanism found in Canada had unique qualities: nowhere else has it been so entrenched for so long, nor so central to the political culture as in Canada.<ref name=\"Brendon O'Connor 2007 https://books.google.com/books?id=Jq4FMb47AnEC&pg=PA71 71\"></ref> Canadian historian Kim Richard Nossal thinks that a low level attenuated form of anti-Americanism permeates Canadian political culture, though \"designed primarily as a means to differentiate Canadians from Americans\". Although Jack Granatstein has suggested that anti-Americanism was dead in Canada, John Herd Thompson and Stephen J. Randall in their book \"Canada and the United States\" (2002) states that there is anecdotal evidence that it still flourishes, and that it continues to nourish the Canadian sense of identity.\n\nMargaret Atwood is a leading Canadian author. In her dystopian novel \"The Handmaid's Tale\" (1986) all the horrible developments take place in the United States near Boston, while Canada is portrayed as the only hope for an escape. This reflects her status of being \"in the vanguard of Canadian anti-Americanism of the 1960s and 1970s.\" Critics have seen Gilead (the U.S.) as a repressive regime and the mistreated Handmaid as Canada. During the debate in 1987 over a free trade agreement between Canada and the United States, Atwood spoke out against the deal, and wrote an essay opposing the agreement.\n\nLiberal Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien was opposed to the Iraq War and refused to allow Canada to participate in it. A 2003 poll found that 71% of Canadians approved of this decision, while 27% disapproved. Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper initially supported the Iraq War when elected in 2006 but by 2008, he had changed his mind and stated that the war was \"a mistake\".\n\nUnited States President George W. Bush was \"deeply disliked\" by a majority of Canadians according to the \"Arizona Daily Sun\". A 2004 poll found that more than two-thirds of Canadians favoured Democrat John Kerry over Bush in the 2004 presidential election, with Bush's lowest approval ratings in Canada being in the province of Quebec, where just 11% of the population supported him. Canadian public opinion of Barack Obama was more positive. A 2012 poll found that 65% of Canadians would vote for Obama in the 2012 presidential election \"if they could\", while only 9% of Canadians would vote for his Republican opponent Mitt Romney. The same study found that 61% of Canadians felt that the Obama administration had been \"good\" for America, while only 12% felt that it had been \"bad\". The study also found that a majority of members of all three major Canadian political parties supported Obama, and that Obama had slightly higher approval ratings in Canada in 2012 than he did in 2008. John Ibbitson of \"The Globe and Mail\" stated in 2012 that Canadians generally supported Democratic presidents over Republican candidates, citing how President Richard Nixon was \"never liked\" in Canada and that Canadians generally did not approve of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's friendship with President Ronald Reagan.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Each position along the continuum represents increasingly complex perceptual organizations of cultural difference, which in turn allow increasingly sophisticated experiences of other cultures. By identifying the underlying experience of cultural difference, predictions about behavior and attitudes can be made and education can be tailored to facilitate development along the continuum. The first three stages are ethnocentric as one sees his own culture as central to reality. Climbing the scale, one develops a more and more ethnorelative point of view, meaning that one experiences one's own culture as in the context of other cultures.\nBy the fourth stage, ethnocentric views are replaced by ethnorelative views.\n\n\nIn his theory, Bennett describes what changes occur when evolving through each step of the scale.

{"id": "1341942", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1341942", "title": "Bevis of Hampton", "text": "Bevis of Hampton\n\nBevis of Hampton (Old French: Beuve(s) or Bueve or Beavis de Hanton(n)e; Anglo-Norman: Boeve de Haumtone; Italian: Buovo d'Antona) or Sir Bevois, was a legendary English hero and the subject of Anglo-Norman, Dutch, French, English, Venetian, and other medieval metrical romances that bear his name. The tale also exists in medieval prose, with translations to Romanian, Russian, Dutch, Irish, Welsh, Old Norse and Yiddish.\n\nSir Bevis of Hampton (c. 1324) is a Middle English romance. It contains many themes common to that genre: a hero whose exploits take him from callow youth to hard-won maturity, ending with a serene and almost sanctified death. Supporting him are a resourceful, appealing heroine and faithful servants set against dynastic intrigue, and a parade of interesting villains, both foreign and domestic. The plot has a geographical sweep which moves back and forth from England to the Near East and through most of western Europe, replete with battles against dragons, giants, and other mythical creatures. Forced marriages, episodes of domestic violence, a myriad of disguises and mistaken identities, harsh imprisonments with dramatic escapes, harrowing rescues, and violent urban warfare fill out the protagonist's experiences. Last but not least, he has a horse of such valor that the horse's death at the end of the poem is at least as tragic as that of the heroine, and almost as tragic as that of Bevis himself. Not surprisingly though, this much variety makes the poem a difficult one to characterize with any degree of certainty, and several other factors make it a poem which is perhaps easier to enjoy than to evaluate accurately.\n\nBevis is the son of Guy, the count of Hampton (Southampton), and Guy's young wife, who is a daughter of the King of Scotland. Discontented with her marriage, Bevis's mother asks a former suitor, Doon or Devoun, emperor of Almaine (Germany), to send an army to murder Guy in a forest. The plot succeeds, and the countess marries Doon. Threatened with future vengeance by her ten-year-old son, she determines to do away with him also, but Bevis is saved from death by a faithful tutor.\n\nBevis is subsequently sold to pirates and ends up at the court of King Hermin, whose realm is variously placed in Egypt and Armenia. The legend continues to relate the exploits of Bevis, his defeat of Ascapart, his love for the king's daughter Josiane, his mission to King Bradmond of Damascus with a sealed letter demanding his own death, his eventual imprisonment, and his final vengeance on his stepfather. After succeeding in claiming his inheritance, however, Bevis is driven into exile and separated from Josiane, with whom he is reunited only after each of them has contracted, in form only, a second union. The story also relates the hero's death and the fortunes of his two sons.\n\nThe oldest version known, \"Boeve de Haumtone\", is an Anglo-Norman text that dates back to the first half of the 13th century. It consists of 3,850 verses written in Alexandrines.\n\nThree continental French chansons de geste of \"Beuve d'Hanstone\", all in decasyllables, were written in the 13th century. One is preserved in BnF Français 25516. They consist of between 10,000 and 20,000 verses. A French prose version was made before 1469.\n\nThe English metrical romance, \"Sir Beues of Hamtoun\" (see Matter of England), is founded based on some French origins, varying slightly from those that have been preserved. The oldest manuscript dates from the beginning of the 14th century. A translation into Irish survives in a 15th-century manuscript.\n\nThe printed editions of the story were most numerous in Italy, where \"Bovo\" or \"Buovo d'Antona\" was the subject of more than one poem, and the tale was interpolated in the \"Reali di Francia\", the Italian compilation of Carolingian legend. An anonymous \"Buovo d'Antona: Cantari in ottava rima\" was printed in 1480, and a \"Tuscan\", in fact Padan of the Po Valley, version in 1497.\n\nFrom Italian, it passed into Yiddish, where the \"Bovo-Bukh\" became the first non-religious book to be printed in Yiddish. The most popular and critically honored Yiddish-language chivalry romance.\n\nIn Russia, the romance attained an unparalleled popularity and became a part of Russian folklore. The Russian rendition of the romance appeared in mid-16th century, translated from a Polish or Old Belarusian version, which were in turn, translated from a Croatian rendition of the Italian romance, made in Ragusa. The resulting narrative, called \"Повесть о Бове-королевиче\" (\"Povest' o Bove-koroleviche\", lit. The Story of ), gradually merged with Russian folktales, and the principal character attained many features of a Russian folk hero (bogatyr). Since the 18th century until 1918, various versions of the Povest' had been widely circulated (particularly among the lower classes) as a \"lubok\". Such writers as Derzhavin and Pushkin praised \"Bova\"'s literary value. The latter used some elements of the Povest' in his fairy tales and attempted to write a fantasy poem based on the romance. Pushkin also praised a version of Bova by Alexander Radishchev, written in 1799.\n\nR. Zenker (\"Boeve-Amlethus\", Berlin and Leipzig, 1904) established a close parallel between Bevis and the Hamlet legend as related by Saxo Grammaticus in the \"Historia Danica\". Some of the details that point to a common source are the vengeance of a stepfather for a father's death, the letter bearing his own death-warrant entrusted to the hero, and his double marriage. However, the motive of feigned madness is lacking in Bevis. The princess who is Josiane's rival is less ferocious than the Hermuthruda of the Hamlet legend, but she does threaten Bevis with death should he refuse her. Both seem modeled on the type of Thyrdo of the Beowulf legend. The 1911 \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" characterizes the mooted etymology connecting Bevis (Boeve) with Béowa (Beowulf), as \"fanciful\" and \"inadmissible\" on the ground that they were both dragon slayers. One alternative theory is that Doon may be identified with the emperor Otto the Great, who was the contemporary of Edgar the Peaceful, the English king Edgar of the story.\n\nNotes\nSources\n\n"}

Bin tippers are a type of lifting equipment used in many industries, including waste management, food processing, chemical manufacturing and facility management.\n\nAlthough bin tippers are often components of larger machines (such as garbage trucks), an increasing number of 'standalone' or mobile units are available. Most bin tippers use mains electricity to power the lifting system, but some are powered by batteries, solar, crank-handle, or compressed air.\n\nBin tippers typically have a steel frame, guarding and cradle, with a motor or crank-handle driving a lifting mechanism, which may be hydraulic or chain operated. Bins are placed into the machine, then lifted and inverted over the destination receptacle, allowing the contents to be emptied by gravity.\n\nMost bin tippers are designed to comply with one of three standards:\n\nA side-load bin tipper was fitted to a garbage truck as early as 1929, by the Heil company in America. In the 1950s the Dempster Dumpmaster popularized the front-end loader variant, with bins being tipped over the cab of the truck. Both types of integrated bin tipper are now common on municipal refuse collection trucks.\n\nStandalone bin tippers developed later, with the release of a machine called the Simpro Ezi-Dump in 1990. This type of machine is now common on large commercial facilities, events venues and campuses, since it allows smaller mobile bins to be dispersed for waste collection, then emptied into a skip bin or dumpster; which in turn can be emptied by a front-load garbage truck.\n\nThe use of bin tippers and other lifting aids has been stimulated in recent years by research linking heavy manual lifting with musculoskeletal disorders; some government organisations, schools and companies now prohibit emptying bins by hand. Health and safety concerns have also driven the adoption of bin tippers in the manufacturing, food-processing and construction industries.\n"}

He has claimed both Justin Stewart and Bryan Bruce as his birth name in different sources. He studied film at York University in Toronto and wrote for \"Cineaction\" magazine, curated by Robin Wood, his teacher.\n\nHe first gained public attention with the publication of the queer punk zine \"J.D.s\", which he co-edited with G.B. Jones. He has written and photographed for a variety of publications including \"Vice\", the former Nerve.com and \"BlackBook Magazine\", and has been a columnist for the Canadian music magazine \"Exclaim!\" and Toronto's \"Eye Weekly\", as well as a contributing editor and photographer for New York's \"Index Magazine\". He has also been published in \"Toronto Life\", the \"National Post\" and \"The Guardian\".\n\nLaBruce's filmmaking style is marked by a blend of explicitly pornographic depictions of sex with more conventional narrative and filmmaking techniques, as well as an interest in extreme topics which mainstream audiences might dismiss as shocking or disturbing taboos. For instance, his films have depicted scenes of sexual fetish and paraphilia, BDSM, gang rape, racially-motivated violence, amputee fetishism, gerontophilia, male and female prostitution, and zombie and vampire sexuality.\n\nHe has frequently been identified with the New Queer Cinema movement that emerged in the 1990s, although at the height of that movement's prominence, he rejected the association on the grounds that he felt more personally aligned with the queercore movement. The queercore movement was born in the 1980s and LaBruce was one of the fathers. Noted as the avant-garde and unapologetic gay answer to the punk movement, queercore expressed the very same discontent with society as the punks were stating.\n\nHis movie, \"Otto; or Up with Dead People\" debuted at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival. \"L.A. Zombie\" was banned from the Melbourne International Film Festival in 2010 because, in the opinion of Australian censors, it would have been refused classification. However, the film was subsequently able to screen at OutTakes, a New Zealand lesbian and gay international film festival, in May 2011.\n\nIn March 2011, LaBruce directed a performance of Arnold Schoenberg's opera \"Pierrot Lunaire\" at the Hebbel am Ufer Theatre in Berlin.

He subsequently also filmed this adaptation as the 2014 theatrical film \"Pierrot Lunaire\".\n\nBeginning with \"Gerontophilia\" in 2013, LaBruce dropped some of the more sexually explicit aspects of his filmmaking style.

Though Standard Malay is promoted as the official language of Brunei, Brunei Malay is socially dominant and it is currently replacing the minority languages of Brunei, including the Dusun and Tutong languages. It is quite divergent from Standard Malay to the point where it is almost mutually unintelligible with it. Although the idea that Brunei Malay might be classified as a creole language has been discredited, it does bear considerable similarities to East Indonesian Malay-based creole languages.\n\nThe consonants of Brunei Malay are shown in the following table.\nSome analysts exclude /w/ and /j/ from this table on the basis that they are 'margin high vowels', while others include /w/ but exclude /j/.\n\nAll these consonants can occur in initial position except /h/. While /h/ can occur in final position, its absence from initial position means that Standard Malay \"hutan\" ('forest') is \"utan\" in Brunei Malay, and Standard Malay \"hitam\" ('black') is \"itam\".\n\nAll the consonants can occur in word-final position apart from the palatal sounds /tʃ dʒ ɲ/ and the voiced plosives /b d ɡ/ (except in a few borrowed words such as \"mac\" ('March') and \"kabab\" ('kebab')).\nBrunei Malay has a three-vowel system: /i/, /a/, /u/. Acoustic variation in the realisation of these vowels is shown in the plot on the right, based on the reading of a short text by a single female speaker.\n\nWhile /i/ is distinct from the other two vowels, there is substantial overlap between /a/ and /u/. This is partly because of the vowel in the first syllable of words such as \"maniup\" ('to blow') which can be realised as [ə]. Indeed, the Brunei Malay dictionary uses an 'e' for the prefix in this word, listing it as \"meniup\", though other analyses prefer to show prefixes such as this with 'a', on the basis that Brunei Malay just has three vowels.\n\nBrunei Malay, Kedayan and Kampong Ayer can be regarded as different dialects of Malay. \"Brunei Malay\" is used by the numerically and politically dominant Brunei people, who traditionally lived on water, while \"Kedayan\" is used by the land-dwelling farmers, and the \"Kampong Ayer\" dialect is used by the inhabitants of the river north of the capital. It has been estimated that 94% of the words of Brunei Malay and Kedayan are lexically related.\n\n \"Bini-bini\" is exclusively used in Brunei to refer to a lady. In Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, it is an informal way to refer to one's wives or a group of married women.\n\n\nThe vocabulary of Brunei Malay has been collected and published by several western explorers in Borneo including Pigafetta in 1521, De Crespigny in 1872, Charles Hose in 1893, A. S. Haynes in 1900, Sidney H. Ray in 1913, H. B. Marshall in 1921, and G. T. MacBryan in 1922, and some Brunei Malay words are included in \"A Malay-English Dictionary\" by R. J. Wilkinson.\n\n\nA Vocabulary of Brunei Malay\nH. B.

{"id": "699350", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=699350", "title": "Comprehensive school", "text": "Comprehensive school\n\nA comprehensive school is a secondary school that is a state school and does not select its intake on the basis of academic achievement or aptitude, in contrast to the selective school system, where admission is restricted on the basis of selection criteria. The term is commonly used in relation to England and Wales, where comprehensive schools were introduced on an experimental basis in the 1940s and became more widespread from 1965. About 90% of British secondary school pupils now attend comprehensive schools. They correspond broadly to the public high school in the United States and Canada and to the \"Gesamtschule\" in Germany.\n\nComprehensive schools provide an entitlement curriculum to all children, without selection whether due to financial considerations or attainment. A consequence of that is a wider ranging curriculum, including practical subjects such as design and technology and vocational learning, which were less common or non-existent in grammar schools. Providing post-16 education cost-effectively becomes more challenging for smaller comprehensive schools, because of the number of courses needed to cover a broader curriculum with comparatively fewer students. This is why schools have tended to get larger and also why many local authorities have organised secondary education into 11–16 schools, with the post-16 provision provided by sixth form colleges and further education colleges. Comprehensive schools do not select their intake on the basis of academic achievement or aptitude, but there are demographic reasons why the attainment profiles of different schools vary considerably. In addition, government initiatives such as the City Technology Colleges and Specialist schools programmes have made the comprehensive ideal less certain.\n\nIn these schools children could be selected on the basis of curriculum aptitude related to the school's specialism even though the schools do take quotas from each quartile of the attainment range to ensure they were not selective by attainment. A problem with this is whether the quotas should be taken from a normal distribution or from the specific distribution of attainment in the immediate catchment area. In the selective school system, which survives in several parts of the United Kingdom, admission is dependent on selection criteria, most commonly a cognitive test or tests. Although comprehensive schools were introduced to England and Wales in 1965, there are 164 selective grammar schools that are still in operation. (though this is a small number compared to approximately 3500 state secondary schools in England).\nMost comprehensives are secondary schools for children between the ages of 11 to 16, but in a few areas there are comprehensive middle schools, and in some places the secondary level is divided into two, for students aged 11 to 14 and those aged 14 to 18, roughly corresponding to the US middle school (or junior high school) and high school, respectively. With the advent of key stages in the National Curriculum some local authorities reverted from the Middle School system to 11–16 and 11–18 schools so that the transition between schools corresponds to the end of one key stage and the start of another.\n\nIn principle, comprehensive schools were conceived as \"neighbourhood\" schools for all students in a specified catchment area.\n\nThe first comprehensives were set up after the Second World War. In 1946, for example, Walworth School was one of five 'experimental' comprehensive schools set up by the London County Council Another early comprehensive school was Holyhead County School in Anglesey in 1949. Coventry opened two Comprehensive School in 1954 by combining Grammar Schools and Secondary Modern Schools. These were Caludon Castle and Woodlands. Another early example was Tividale Comprehensive School in Tipton. The first, purpose-built comprehensive in the North of England was Colne Valley High School near Huddersfield in 1956.\n\nThe largest expansion of comprehensive schools resulted from a policy decision taken in 1965 by Anthony Crosland, Secretary of State for Education in the 1964–1970 Labour government. The policy decision was implemented by Circular 10/65, an instruction to local education authorities to plan for conversion. Students sat the 11+ examination in their last year of primary education and were sent to one of a secondary modern, secondary technical or grammar school depending on their perceived ability. Secondary technical schools were never widely implemented and for 20 years there was a virtual bipartite system which saw fierce competition for the available grammar school places, which varied between 15% and 25% of total secondary places, depending on location.\n\nIn 1970 Margaret Thatcher, the Secretary of State for Education in the new Conservative government, ended the compulsion on local authorities to convert, however, many local authorities were so far down the path that it would have been prohibitively expensive to attempt to reverse the process, and more comprehensive schools were established under Thatcher than any other education secretary.\n\nBy 1975 the majority of local authorities in England and Wales had abandoned the 11-Plus examination and moved to a comprehensive system. Over that 10-year period many secondary modern schools and grammar schools were amalgamated to form large neighbourhood comprehensives, whilst a number of new schools were built to accommodate a growing school population. By the mid-1970s the system had been almost fully implemented, with virtually no secondary modern schools remaining. Many grammar schools were either closed or changed to comprehensive status. Some local authorities, including Sandwell and Dudley in the West Midlands, changed all of its state secondary schools to comprehensive schools during the 1970s. \n\nIn 1976 the future Labour prime minister James Callaghan launched what became known as the 'great debate' on the education system. He went on to list the areas he felt needed closest scrutiny: the case for a core curriculum, the validity and use of informal teaching methods, the role of school inspection and the future of the examination system. Comprehensive school remains the most common type of state secondary school in England, and the only type in Wales. They account for around 90% of pupils, or 64% if one does not count schools with low-level selection. This figure varies by region.\n\nSince the 1988 Education Reform Act, parents have a right to choose which school their child should go to or whether to not send them to school at all and to home educate them instead. The concept of \"school choice\" introduces the idea of competition between state schools, a fundamental change to the original \"neighbourhood comprehensive\" model, and is partly intended as a means by which schools that are perceived to be inferior are forced either to improve or, if hardly anyone wants to go there, to close down. Government policy is currently promoting 'specialisation' whereby parents choose a secondary school appropriate for their child's interests and skills. Most initiatives focus on parental choice and information, implementing a pseudo-market incentive to encourage better schools. This logic has underpinned the controversial league tables of school performance.\n\nScotland has a very different educational system from England and Wales, though also based on comprehensive education. It has different ages of transfer, different examinations and a different philosophy of choice and provision. All publicly funded primary and secondary schools are comprehensive. The Scottish Government has rejected plans for specialist schools as of 2005.\n\nEducation in Northern Ireland differs slightly from systems used elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but it is more similar to that used in England and Wales than it is to Scotland.\n\nWhen the first comprehensive schools appeared in the 1950s, the Australian Government started to transition to comprehensive schooling which has been expanding and improving ever since. Prior to the transition into comprehensive schooling systems, primary and secondary state schools regularly measured students' academic merit based on their performance in public examinations. The state of Western Australia was the first to replace many multilateral school systems, proceeding with Queensland, and finally South Australia and Victoria. \n\nThe Australian education system is organised through three compulsory school types. Students commence their education in Primary school, which runs for seven or eight years, starting at kindergarten through to Year 6 or 7. The next is Secondary school which runs for three or four years, from Year 7 or 8 to Year 10. Finally, Senior Secondary school which runs for two years, completing Years 11 and 12. Each school tier follows a comprehensive curriculum that is categorised into sequences for each Year-level. The Year-level follows specific sequence content and achievement for each subject, which can be interrelated through cross-curricula. In order for students to complete and graduate each tier-level of schooling, they need to complete the subject sequences of content and achievement. Once students have completed Year 12, they may choose to enter into Tertiary education. The two-tier Tertiary education system in Australia includes both higher education (i.e.: University, College, other Institutions) and vocational education and training (VET). Higher education works off of the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) and prepares Australians for an academic route that may take them into the theoretical and philosophical lenses of their career options.\n\n"}
{"id": "31865085", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31865085", "title": "Debate between sheep and grain", "text": "Debate between sheep and grain\n\nThe \"Debate between sheep and grain\" or \"Myth of cattle and grain\" is a Sumerian creation myth, written on clay tablets in the mid to late 3rd millennium BCE.\n\nSeven \"debate\" topics are known from the Sumerian literature, falling in the category of 'disputations'; some examples are: the Debate between Winter and Summer; the Debate between bird and fish; the Tree and the Reed; and \"The Dispute between Silver and Copper\". These topics came some centuries after writing was established in Sumerian Mesopotamia. The debates are philosophical and address humanity's place in the world.\n\nThe first sixty-one lines of the myth were discovered on the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology catalogue of the Babylonian section, tablet number 14,005 from their excavations at the temple library at Nippur. This was translated by George Aaron Barton in 1918 and first published as \"Sumerian religious texts\" in \"Miscellaneous Babylonian Inscriptions\", number eight, entitled \"A New Creation Myth\". The tablet is at its thickest point. Barton describes the text as an \"elaborate statement of the non-existence of many things once upon a time\" and considered it a \"statement that mankind was brought into existence through the physical union of a god and a goddess.\"\n\nAnother tablet from the same collection, number 6893 (part of which was destroyed) was translated by Edward Chiera in 1924 increasing the text to seventy lines in \"Sumerian religious texts\". Chiera compiled his translation using further tablets translated by Hugo Radau published in \"Miscellaneous Sumerian Texts\" in 1909. Stephen Herbert Langdon also translated further parts of the text and discusses the myth saying, \"One of the most remarkable tablets in the Museum is number 14005, a didactic poem in 61 lines on the period of pre-culture and institution of paradise by the earth god and the water god in Dilmun\". It was then increased to two hundred lines and the myth called \"cattle and grain\" by Samuel Noah Kramer in 1959; he called it the \"second myth significant for the Sumerian concept of the creation of man\". He added the translation of a tablet by Hermann Hilprecht and included translations of museum tablet numbers 7344, 7916, 15161 and 29.15.973. He also included translations from tablets in the Nippur collection of the Museum of the Ancient Orient in Istanbul, catalogue numbers 2308, 4036 and 4094. Other translations were taken from Edward Chiera's \"Sumerian Epics and Myths\" numbers 38, 54, 55, 56 and 57. In total, seventeen pieces were found by Kramer to belong to the myth. Later work has added to this and modern translation has removed the deification of Lahar and Ashnan, naming them simply \"grain\" and \"sheep\" (also known as cattle).\n\nThe story opens with a location \"the hill of heaven and earth\" which is discussed by Chiera as \"not a poetical name for the earth, but the dwelling place of the gods, situated at the point where the heavens rest upon the earth. It is there that mankind had their first habitat, and there the Babylonian Garden of Eden is to be placed.\" The Sumerian word Edin, means \"steppe\" or \"plain\", so modern scholarship has abandoned the use of the phrase \"Babylonian Garden of Eden\" as it has become clear that the \"Garden of Eden\" was a later concept. Jeremy Black suggests that this area was restricted for gods, noting that field plans from the Third dynasty of Ur use the term hursag (\"hill\") to describe the hilly parts of fields that are hard to cultivate due to the presence of prehistoric tell mounds (ruined habitations). Kramer discusses the story of the god An creating the cattle-goddess, Lahar, and the grain goddess, Ashnan, to feed and clothe the Annunaki, who in turn made man. Lahar and Ashnan are created in the \"duku\" or \"pure place\" and the story further describes how the Annunaki create a sheepfold with plants and herbs for Lahar and a house, plough and yoke for Ashnan, describing the introduction of animal husbandry and agriculture. The story continues with a quarrel between the two goddesses over their gifts which eventually resolves with Enki and Enlil intervening to declare Ashnan the victor.\n\nSamuel Noah Kramer has noted the parallels and variations between the story and the later one of Cain and Abel in the Bible Book of Genesis (). Ewa Wasilewska mentions, \"this text is not very clear, allowing for the interpretation that humankind was already present before Lahar and Ashnan were created and it was them, not the Anunnakû, who were not able to provide for themselves and for the deities until they were given divine 'breath' (Lyczkowska and Szarzynska 1981). However, it seems that Kramer's translation is more appropriate concerning the Sumerian realm in which each and every creation must have had its clearly described purpose\". Karen Rhea Nemet-Nejat noted the use of measuring rods in the tale as being linked to the history of writing, which developed in order to keep count of animals and produce. Jeremy Black suggests that the victory of grain perhaps implies that man can live without domestic animals, but cannot survive without bread. He goes on to point out that the debates on both sides are roughly equal.\n\nThe introduction to the myth reads:\n\nThe benefits that grain and sheep bring to the habitation are also described:\n\nThe final merits of grain are emphasized in a proverb at the end of the myth:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "28061842", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28061842", "title": "Eighteen Arhats", "text": "Eighteen Arhats\n\nThe Eighteen Arhats (or Luohan) () are depicted in Mahayana Buddhism as the original followers of Gautama Buddha who have followed the Noble Eightfold Path and attained the four stages of enlightenment. They have reached the state of Nirvana and are free of worldly cravings. They are charged to protect the Buddhist faith and to wait on earth for the coming of Maitreya, an enlightened Buddha prophesied to arrive on earth many millennia after Gautama Buddha's death (parinirvana). In China, the eighteen arhats are also a popular subject in Buddhist art, such as the famous Chinese group of glazed pottery luohans from Yixian from about 1000 CE.\n\nOriginally, the arhats were composed of only 10 disciples of Gautama Buddha, although the earliest Indian sutras indicate that only 4 of them, Pindola, Kundadhana, Panthaka and Nakula, were instructed to await the coming of Maitreya. Earliest Chinese representations of the arhats can be traced back to as early as the fourth century, and mainly focused on Pindola who was popularized in art by the book \"Method for Inviting Pindola\" ().\n\nLater this number increased to sixteen to include patriarchs and other spiritual adepts. Teachings about the Arhats eventually made their way to China where they were called \"Luohan\" (羅漢, shortened from \"a-luo-han\" a Chinese transcription for Arhat), but it wasn't until 654 AD when the Nandimitrāvadāna (), \"Record on the Duration of the Law, spoken by the Great arhat Nadimitra\", was translated by Xuanzang into Chinese that the names of these arhats were known. For some reason Kundadhana was dropped from this list.\n\nSomewhere between the late Tang Dynasty and early Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period of China two other Luohans were added to the roster increasing the number to 18. But this depiction of 18 Luohans only gained a foothold in China, whereas other areas like Japan continued to revere only sixteen and their roster differs somewhat. This depiction of having 18 instead of 16 Luohans continues into modern Chinese Buddhist traditions. A cult built around the Luohans as guardians of Buddhist faith gained momentum amongst Chinese Buddhists at the end of the ninth century for they had just been through a period a great persecution under the reign of Emperor Tang Wuzong. In fact the last two additions to this roster, Taming Dragon and Taming Tiger, are thinly veiled swipes against Taoism.\n\nBecause no historical records detailing what the Luohans looked like existed, there were no distinguishing features to tell the Luohans apart in early Chinese depictions. The first portraits of the 16 Luohans were painted by the monk Guanxiu in 891 AD, who at the time was residing in Chengdu. Legend has it that the 16 Luohans knew of Guanxiu's expert calligraphy and painting skills, so they appeared to the monk in a dream to make a request that he paint their portraits.\nThe paintings depicted them as foreigners having bushy eyebrows, large eyes, hanging cheeks and high noses. They were seated in landscapes, leaning against pine trees and stones. An additional theme in these paintings was that they were portrayed as being unkempt and \"eccentric,\" which emphasizes that they were vagabonds and beggars who have left all worldly desires behind. When Guanxiu was asked how he came up with the depictions, he answered: \"It was in a dream that I saw these Gods and Buddhas. After I woke up, I painted what I saw in the dream. So, I guess I can refer to these Luohans as 'Luohans in a dream'.\" These portraits painted by Guanxiu have become the definitive images for the 18 Luohans in Chinese Buddhist iconography, although in modern depictions they bear more Sinitic features and at the same time have lost their exaggerated foreign features in exchange for more exaggerated expressions. The paintings were donated by Guanxiu to the Shengyin Temple in Qiantang (present day Hangzhou) where they are preserved with great care and ceremonious respect. Many prominent artists such as Wu Bin and Ding Guanpeng would later try to faithfully imitate the original paintings.\n\nThe Qianlong Emperor was a great admirer of the Luohans and during his visit to see the paintings in 1757, Qianlong not only examined them closely but he also wrote a eulogy to each Luohan image. Copies of these eulogies were presented to the monastery and preserved. In 1764, Qianlong ordered that the paintings held at the Shengyin Monastery be reproduced and engraved on stone tablets for preservation. These were mounted like facets on a marble stupa for public display. The temple was destroyed during the Taiping Rebellion but copies of ink rubbings of the steles were preserved in and outside of China.\n\nIn the Chinese Tradition, the 18 Luohans are generally presented in the order they are said to have appeared to Guan Xiu, not according to their power: Deer Sitting, Happy, Raised Bowl, Raised Pagoda, Meditating, Oversea, Elephant Riding, Laughing Lion, Open Heart, Raised Hand, Thinking, Scratched Ear, Calico Bag, Plantain, Long Eyebrow, Doorman, Taming Dragon and Taming Tiger.\n"}

He is now known best for his writings concerning ancient myths, especially his book \"Anacalypsis\", published posthumously, in which he asserts a commonality among various religious myths, which he traces back to the supposed lost religion of Atlantis. He has been termed a \"political radical, reforming county magistrate and idiosyncratic historian of religions\".\n\nHiggins was the son of Godfrey Higgins of Skellow Grange, near Doncaster. He was educated in Hemsworth before being admitted to Emmanuel College, Cambridge in 1790, and transferring to Trinity Hall in 1791. He later studied law at the Inner Temple, but was not granted a license to practice law, and refrained from practice. When Napoleon threatened an invasion of the United Kingdom, Higgins joined the Volunteer Corps and became a Captain of the Third West York Militia. In 1800 he married Jane Thorpe, who gave birth to his son, also named Godfrey, and two daughters, Jane and Charlotte. After Higgins' promotion to the rank of major in 1808, he resigned from the Volunteer Corps citing a severe fever as reason. Soon thereafter he was appointed as magistrate or justice of the peace in Yorkshire.\n\nHiggins' work as a magistrate featured reformist campaigns, as part of which he \"courageously exposed the scandalous treatment of pauper lunatics and campaigned for Parliamentary Reform, criticizing excessive taxation, the Corn Laws, and the exploitation of children in factories\". He was also favoured disestablishing the Church of Ireland. In 1814 he had a major role in uncovering the abuse of patients at the York Lunatic Asylum after rumours of serious misconduct had come to his attention. He joined Quaker William Tuke in agitating for reform. In a surprise visit he forced staff to open doors which revealed female patients kept in \"a number of secret cells in a state of filth, horrible beyond description...the most miserable objects I ever beheld.\" Most of the staff were dismissed and Higgins was able to secure a government enquiry into the management of the asylum, at which he gave evidence. Higgins was appointed as a Governor of the Asylum. He proceeded to investigate a suspicious fire that had destroyed many of the asylum's records, concluding that it was unlikely to have started by accident.\n\nMeanwhile, he developed a regimen to study the meaning of life and religion, and wrote:\n\nI came to a resolution to devote six hours a day to this pursuit for ten years. Instead of six hours daily for ten years, I believe I have, upon the average, applied myself to it for nearly ten hours daily for almost twenty years. In the first ten years of my search I may fairly say, I found nothing which I sought for; in the latter part of the twenty, the quantity of matter has so crowded in upon me, that I scarcely know how to dispose of it.\nA keen antiquarian, Higgins was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. According to Ross Nichols, Higgins was also a \"Chosen Chief\" of the Order of Druids, founded by John Toland in 1717. Higgins was claimed a member of An Uileach Druidh Braithreaches (The Druid Order), an ancient Druid order that predates the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn; however, these claims are unsubstantiated. Regardless, Higgins demonstrated extensive knowledge and familiarity with the traditions of Druid orders in his work, \"The Celtic Druids\".\n\nHiggins' wife died on 18 May 1822. Higgins' own death, on 9 August 1833, resulted from an illness which he suffered while attending a meeting of The British Association for the Advancement of Science at Cambridge.\n\nHiggins' main writings were part of the syncretism of the day, which was an attempt to associate Biblical narratives to evidence emerging about other religious traditions. Higgins discussed, and argued with, other authors of this tradition such as Jacob Bryant, Roger O'Connor and William Jones. Higgins' own writings, especially \"Anacalypsis\", were later to have a major influence on the development of Theosophy, through the publications of Helena Blavatsky.\n\nAccording to Ronald Hutton, Higgins' \"Anacalypsis\" says that,\n\nThese ideas \"lay dormant for about forty years, and was then taken up and given a considerable popularity by one of the century's truly international figures, Helena Petrovna Blavatsky\".\n\nHutton describes Higgins as an \"occultist and mystic\", and Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke also terms him an \"occultist\". Nevertheless, Wouter Hanegraaff, who has written a detailed history of esotericism, says that Higgins had no interest in either occultism or esotericism. Higgins main interests were the history of religious beliefs and practical sociology.\n\n\n\n'\"One thing is clear—the mythos of the Hindus, the mythos of the Jews and the mythos of the Greeks are all at bottom the same; and what are called their early histories are not histories of humankind, but are contrivances under the appearance of histories to perpetuate doctrines.\" Higgins bluntly declares that every ancient author, without exception, has come to us through the medium of Christian editors who have \"either from roguery or folly, corrupted them all.”\n\n\"There seems to be nothing improbable in these Ethiopians being the tribe of the Jews—the tribe of Jacob or Israel. I think these Ethiopians did come under Jacob, and did settle in Goshen, and gave the names of Maturea and Avaris to the city in which they dwelt.\" Page 399\n\"Solomon was a personification or incarnation of wisdom, and the Jews, of Asia Minor were a tribe or colony from India, of black Buddhists, at or about the same time with the Ioudi to Syria, under the Brahmin.\"\n\"All the hero Gods Theseus, Bacchus, Æsculapius, &c., were saviours and black saviours too. These black icons were made when man himself was black. He made his God after himself, and then said that man was made after the image of God.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "44416679", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44416679", "title": "Halo hat", "text": "Halo hat\n\nA halo hat (sometimes halo brim hat) is a millinery design in which the headgear acts as a circular frame for the face, creating a halo effect. The design is said to date back to the late 19th century, when it was known as the aureole hat; this name is sometimes still used. It may also be known as the \"angel hat\" or \"bambini\" – the latter said to derive from Italian for terracotta plaques depicting the infant Christ.\n\nA halo hat may be a wide range of sizes – some lying close to the head in the style of a bonnet or cloche and others that are similar in dimensions to a picture or cartwheel hat. Typically, designs are worn towards the back of the head to create the 'halo' effect. Some designs with open crowns may also be referred to as halo hats or as diadems. Popular from the 1930s on, the halo hat was created in a variety of fabrics – knitted or crocheted versions could be made at home – and could be a circle or semi-circle in shape. The halo became popular with brides; one of the most famous examples is the blue straw half-circle halo created for the wedding of Wallis Simpson by the Parisian millinery house of Caroline Reboux.\n\nThe halo hat is said to have first come into fashion the late 1880s, when it was usually known as an aureole hat (a synonym for halo), and this was a name that continued to be used to describe the circular or semi-circular shape into the 1930s. The \"Milwaukee Sentinel\" used the term to describe a new hat style in 1937. Similarly, describing the outfits worn by racegoers at a Sandown Park meet in 1937, \"The Times\" referred to an: \"aureole-brimmed\" hat design.\nThe halo shape became popular again from the start of the 1930s in both the United States and Europe. It was a distinct move away from the cloche style that was worn low over the brow, as the halo exposed the face and brow, also showing off more elaborate curled hairstyles becoming popular during this era. \n\n\"Halo hats are so new\" declared an advert in a US newspaper in 1931. A 1934 Sears catalogue featured a halo hat design as part of its Loretta Young collection, adding: \"Take advantage of Loretta Young's fashion judgement and wear this new off-the-face hat! It's \"different\"...There's something of the angel's halo and something of the bucaneer's bravado in its dramatic, folded-back brim\".\n\nIn 1933 \"The Times\" reviewed the Christmas catalogues, saying: \"the new season millinery, with its leading novelty, the 'halo' hat, is specially interesting\". The following year, the Duchess of York was described as wearing a velvet halo hat to attend a charity matinee with Princess Elizabeth. Three years later, Wallis Simpson would wear an iconic gown and halo bridal headpiece, made by Caroline Reboux's studio in Paris and trimmed with pink and blue feathers.\n\nThe halo was a flexible design. While it could create a large frame around the face – as with the circular straw design that featured on the \"Picture Post\" in 1940 – it could also have more modest proportions. Like the draped turban, the halo style lent itself to adaptations – feathers, bows, trims or flowers could be added – making it a versatile hat style. It could also be made at home; a variety of patterns were created during the 1940s to inspire knitters and sewers. Larger versions suited the post-war New Look designs, balancing the proportions of the full skirts that were fashionable after wartime austerity.\n\nThe halo-style hat became popular for wedding outfits – future First Lady of the United States Betty Ford wore a large-brimmed halo wedding hat in 1938 – and half halos would become a staple design for more traditional wedding headpieces, remaining popular in bridal designs.\n\nIn the mid 1960s, British Pathé's 1964 film \"Hats on for Winter\" featured a large-scale halo design with sunburst pattern, alongside visors and caps. Designers such as Graham Smith created oversized examples during the late 1980s.\n\nAmong the most memorable modern halo-shaped hats are the design created by Philip Treacy for influential fashion editor Isabella Blow, and the wheatsheaf halo-effect headpiece he designed for the wedding of Camilla Parker Bowles to Prince Charles.\n\n\n"}

The minister of Ruthwell parish church in Dumfriesshire, he founded the world's first commercial savings bank. He served as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1839. He was also an author, publisher and philanthropist.\n\nDuncan was born in 1774 at Lochrutton, Kirkcudbrightshire, where his father, George Duncan, was minister. As a boy he met the poet Robert Burns, who visited Lochrutton Manse. Duncan was educated in Dumfries at the Academy. After studying for two sessions at St. Andrews University he was sent to Liverpool to begin commercial life, and under the patronage of his relative, Dr. James Currie, the biographer of Robert Burns, his prospects of success were very fair; but his heart was not in business, and he soon left Liverpool to study at Edinburgh and Glasgow for the ministry of the Church of Scotland. Whilst in Edinburgh he joined the Speculative Society, and became intimate with Francis Horner and Henry Brougham.\n\nIn 1798 he was ordained as minister of the Church of Scotland and became Minister at Ruthwell in Dumfriesshire in 1799, where he spent the rest of his life. Duncan from the first was remarkable for the breadth of his views, especially in what concerned the welfare of the people, and the courage and ardour with which he promoted measures not usually thought to be embraced in the minister's rôle. In a time of scarcity he brought Indian corn from Liverpool. At the time when a French invasion was dreaded he raised a company of volunteers, of which he was the captain. He published a series of cheap popular tracts, contributing to the series some that were much prized, afterwards collected under the title \"The Cottage Fireside\". He originated a newspaper, \"The Dumfries and Galloway Courier\", of which he was editor for seven years.\n\nThe measure which is most honourably connected with Duncan's name was the institution of savings banks. The first savings bank was instituted at Ruthwell in 1810, and Duncan was unceasing in his efforts to promote the cause throughout the country. His influence was used to procure the first act of parliament passed to encourage such institutions. By speeches, lectures, and pamphlets he made the cause known far and wide. The scheme readily commended itself to all intelligent friends of the people, and the growing progress and popularity of the movement have received no check to the present day. Great though his exertions were, and large his outlay in this cause, he never received any reward or acknowledgement beyond the esteem of those who appreciated his work and the spirit in which it was done.\n\nIn 1810 Duncan opened the world's first commercial savings bank, which would eventually form part of the Trustee Savings Bank, paying interest on its investors' modest savings. The bicentenary of this event was celebrated with a conference held by the Centre for Theology and Public Issues at the University of Edinburgh. Speakers investigated Duncan's legacy in light of current social, financial, and religious dynamics. The Savings Bank Museum tells the story of early home savings in Britain.\n\nIn 1823 Duncan received the degree of D.D. from the University of St. Andrews. In 1836 he published the first volume of a work which reached ultimately to four volumes, entitled \"The Sacred Philosophy of the Seasons\". It was well received, and ran through several editions. To the \"Transactions of the Scottish Antiquarian Society\" he contributed a description of a celebrated runic cross: the Ruthwell Cross (now in Ruthwell church), one of the finest Anglo-Saxon crosses in Britain. This late 7th/early 8th century cross, which he discovered in his parish and restored in 1818, and on which volumes have since been written, is remarkable for its runic inscription, which contains excerpts from \"The Dream of the Rood\", an Old English poem.\n\nHe made a memorable contribution likewise to geological science. In 1828 Duncan presented a paper to the Royal Society of Edinburgh describing the discovery of the fossil footmarks of four legged vertebrate animals in the Permian red sandstone of Corncockle Muir, near Lochmaben. The paper, published in 1831, was one of the first two scientific reports of a fossil track (the other being made by Mr. J. Grierson). A cast of the tracks of \"Chelichnus duncani\" can be found in the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.\n\nWhile at first not very decided between the moderate and the evangelical party in the church, Duncan soon sided with the latter, and became the intimate friend of such men as Dr. Chalmers and Dr. Andrew Thomson. In the earlier stages of the controversy connected with the Scottish church he addressed letters on the subject to his old college friends Lord Brougham and the Marquis of Lansdowne, and to Lord Melbourne, home secretary.\n\nIn 1839 Duncan became Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, and at the time of the Disruption of 1843 became one of the founding ministers of the Free Church of Scotland leaving a manse and grounds that had been rendered very beautiful by his taste and skill.\n\nHenry Duncan was visited by Robert Murray M'Cheyne during his vacations in Ruthwell.\n\nDuncan was a man of most varied accomplishments — manual, intellectual, social, and spiritual. With the arts of drawing, modelling, sculpture, landscape-gardening, and even the business of an architect, he was familiar, and his knowledge of literature and science was varied and extensive. In private and family life he was highly estimable, while his ministerial work was carried on with great earnestness and delight. The stroke of paralysis that ended his life on 19 February 1846 fell on him while conducting a religious service in the cottage of an elder.\n\nDuncan's first wife whom he married in November 1804 was Agnes Craig, daughter of his predecessor, the Rev. John Craig. They had two sons and a daughter. Agnes Duncan died of influenza in 1832. Duncan's second wife whom he married in 1836 was Mary Grey, daughter of George Grey of West Ord, sister of John Grey of Dilston, a well-known Northumbrian gentleman (see memoir by his daughter, Mrs. Josephine Butler), widow of the Rev. R. Lundie of Kelso, and mother of Jane Lundie Bonar. She was a lady of considerable accomplishments and force of character, and author of several books:\n\nDuncan's son George John Craig Duncan was born in 1806. He became the minister at Kirkpatrick Durham. His wife was Isabelle Wight Duncan who was a notable author.\nHenry Duncan's daughter Barbara referred to by Thomas Carlyle as \"the bonny little Barbara Duncan\" married the Rev. James Dodds of Dunbar.\n\nThe headquarters of TSB Bank (a descendent of the original Trustee Savings Bank) is named after him. \n\nThe following is a full list of Duncan's publications:\n\n\n\n"}

They are frequently used to print onto T-shirts.\n\nOn one side is paper, and on the other is the image that will be transferred in reverse. After placing it on the fabric and either running over the fabric side with an iron or pressing with a heat press, the image is transferred to the fabric. Iron-on transfer paper is available for use with computer printers.\n\nCommercial quality heat transfer paper used in a heat press will yield much better results in terms of 'hand' (how the print feels on the fabric) and durability than store bought papers or transfers applied with a home iron.\n\nA number of inkjet, copier and laser printer toners have been developed to utilize this process. This is the process developed at BlackLightning by Walter Jeffries in the 1980s for negatively charged laser printer toners for use in black and white laser printers like those from Apple, HP, Xerox, Canon and other vendors.\n\nThe advantages of commercial heat transfer over screenprinting are that it is relatively cheap and easy to create one-off, full color designs. Also, when compared with dye sublimation techniques, heat transfers can be used on 100% cotton garments, whereas dye sublimation requires at least a 50/50 poly cotton garment.\n\nIron-on fabric has a glue backing that melts into another fabric it is applied to with heat. It is used in patching torn clothes or to apply extra fabric in places subject to extreme wear. An alternative to iron on adhesive is dryer heat activated adhesive.\n\nThere are primarily 2 types of iron-on labels: a form of material tape; and a form of vinyl similar to that used on graphic t-shirts. With the vinyl type the objective is to effectively melt the label onto the cloth so the label and garment become one, hence a permanent bond. The application of a label typically takes about 10–15 seconds for the label to become one with the garment and then a few minutes to cool.\n\nIron-on appliques are decorative embroidery items with a melt-glue backing.\n\nIron-on patches can be created in a variety of ways. The key behind all iron on patches is an heat reactive adhesive is added to an imprinted material to allow an iron or heat press to activate the glue. Different glues react to different fabrics in different ways.\n"}

She died less than two weeks before the November 2, 2010 election, in which she had been expected to easily win reelection. Her name remained on the ballot in the 28th Senate District. Oropeza posthumously won reelection on November 2, 2010.\n\nShe served in the California State Assembly for six years prior (2000–2006) to her time in the Senate. Oropeza and Tom Mullins married in August 1977.\n\nOropeza graduated from Alhambra High School and received a bachelor's degree in Business Administration from California State University, Long Beach. She began her career in public service by serving two terms as student body president at California State University, Long Beach. During that time, she was appointed by the governor to the Board of Trustees of the CSU system.\n\nOropeza was the first Latina to serve as a member of the Long Beach Unified School District Board of Education and held office from 1988 to 1994. In 1994, she was elected the first Latina member of the Long Beach City Council and won re-election in 1998.

She served two years. From 2004 to 2006, Oropeza chaired the Assembly Transportation Committee.\n\nShe was Vice Chair of the dual-house Latino Caucus. In 2005, the League of California Cities' Latino Caucus named her Legislator of the Year; in 2006, the Los Angeles League of Conservation Voters awarded her the Smith-Weiss Environmental Champion Award for her work on issues from air pollution and cancer prevention to radiation and environmental advocacy. She had long supported transportation improvements, including Proposition 42 in 2002, which sought to dedicate a portion of gasoline taxes toward construction.\n\nOn June 6, 2006, Oropeza won a very close Democratic primary against former Assembly member George Nakano. Oropeza was endorsed by the California Democratic Party and the California League of Conservation Voters. Nakano had been endorsed by Congresswoman Jane Harman and California Assemblyman Ted Lieu.

{"id": "31108931", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31108931", "title": "Left 4 Dead: The Sacrifice", "text": "Left 4 Dead: The Sacrifice\n\nThe Sacrifice is a digital comic book created by Valve Corporation based on the \"Left 4 Dead\" video game, detailing the events that the protagonists–Zoey, Louis, Francis, and Bill–experience after the chronological final campaign, \"Blood Harvest\". It accompanies a campaign in both \"Left 4 Dead\" and \"Left 4 Dead 2\" of the same name. It also serves as a prequel to the campaign from \"Left 4 Dead 2\" called \"The Passing\", which makes allusions to the events.\n\n\"The Sacrifice\" takes place between the \"Blood Harvest\" campaign of the main \"Left 4 Dead\" game, and leads up to the events of \"The Sacrifice\" downloadable campaign for \"Left 4 Dead\". Interspersed within the story are flashbacks showing the events that each Survivor experienced a short time \"after First Infection\"; watching friends, loved ones, and strangers turn into zombie-like creatures before their eyes and each realizing they are immune to the Infection.\n\nFrom the end of \"Blood Harvest\", the four Survivors—Bill, Zoey, Louis, and Francis—are rescued by U.S. Army and taken to Millhaven, a well-fortified army base. They are immediately split up; Francis and Louis are put into an isolation room, while Bill and Zoey are tested by a doctor. All four learn that they are \"Carriers\", having the virus yet showing no symptoms. Zoey herself is horrified to learn that her father, who requested her to kill him before he turned, had the Carrier gene, meaning that his death could have been avoided. They describe to Lt. Mora how the Infection has mutated to create \"Special\" Infected with unique abilities. Though Lt. Mora agrees with the Survivors' reports (having seen the Special Infected himself), his superior, Everly, is highly skeptical, and refuses to take steps to consider evacuating the base despite not receiving orders for the last nine days. Mora becomes concerned that the Survivors may be on the side of the Infected, and privately discusses plans to evacuate the facility.\nMora overthrows Everly and sounds the evac alarm, unintentionally drawing Infected that attack the base, including several Special Infected able to breach the base's defense. As Mora's squad attempt to hold back the Infected; Bill, Zoey, Louis, and Francis, along with two befriended soldiers and a doctor (who is also immune), attempt to make their way to a nearby trainyard to a train south towards Florida. As they are escaping, Mora, injured from battle, attempts to stop the group, believing them responsible for the invasion; but Bill knocks him down. As they discover a train, Everly attempts to escape in a helicopter, but a Tank sends it crashing to the ground. Finding an available train, the group becomes concerned that it has become too quiet, and Zoey suggests there is something lying in wait for them. They are soon attacked by a Tank and a horde of Infected. The two soldiers sacrifice themselves to protect the group as they start the train. While the four Survivors are able to board in time, the doctor lags behind; to Zoey's dismay and anger, Bill refuses to slow down, stating that \"we come back for our own\".\n\nAs they travel south, Bill explains that his plan is to get them to the islands of the Florida Keys; as the Infected cannot swim, they will be safe there. At a town at the end of the line, they start searching for a boat. While navigating the town, Zoey explains to Francis that she doesn't understand Bill; Francis says that \"Bill doesn't always do the right thing, but he does it for the right reasons\". Shortly after, they find a yacht, but Louis is severely injured when he finds it packed with Witches. After burning the yacht, the group finds a sailboat, filled with provisions and medicine; however, to get it downriver, they must raise a rusty old bridge blocking their path. They start nearby generators and prepare to fight the horde while waiting for the bridge to be raised, but soon the generators give out. Bill, without pause, jumps off the bridge and makes his way to the generators, restarting them as three Tanks strike him and maul him to death. Francis attempts to go after Bill but Zoey stops him, sadly commenting that Bill's sacrifice will have been for nothing. After waiting for the horde to disperse, the three quietly return to the boat and set course to the Keys.\n\nThe comics were illustrated by Michael Avon Oeming, a comic books veteran. Valve stated that the comic was made both because it wants to expand its video games into other mediums, as well as in response to both the critical reception that the \"Team Fortress 2\" comics received and the commercial sales that the comic led to for \"Team Fortress 2\". While the plot of \"The Sacrifice\" is canon, its creators Valve Corporation made a note that they did not want to force the plot into the game; as such, they designed the accompanying in-game campaign to choose how it ends. Valve commented that they hated to see video games made into bad films or comics, due to most of them being \"disconnected from [the video game's] source\", so they decided to make the comic in-house. They commissioned Oeming to illustrate their comic to allow the comic to reach a certain level of quality. While the comic began as smaller than the current size, it grew as they fleshed out certain parts, due to their enjoyment of the characters and their intention to \"give each one time in the spotlight.\" Valve also explains that they feel that comics are a better format for video game adaptations than films; they state that when players get attached to a character, a comic book allows them to appreciate them more than a two-hour film versus spending \"hours and hours, even hundreds of hours with them\" with them in the video game. They add that comics help to go into stories that the game doesn't elaborate on.\n\nMuch of the comic's content was created before the comic was created; in particular, the flashback featuring Francis was one of the first thing that was written for him. Valve explains the addition of numerous supporting characters is due to the new format; where the video games only allowed for focus on the main characters, they could go more in depth on others and show the effects of the infection on the rest of the world. When asked why Bill was chosen to die, Valve explained that they wanted the sacrifice to be done by the most impacting and favourite character by both Valve and the community, as well as the fact that his story matched \"The Sacrifice\" well.\n\n\"The Sacrifice\" was released in four parts. Valve released it in both downloadable PDF format or viewable on their web site. They specifically released versions of the comic without text or speech bubbles for the purpose of allowing fans to localize them into other languages. They added that this would allow fans to make their own dialogue for them. Valve announced that the best fan-made comics would be featured on the \"Left 4 Dead\" developer's blog. The first part was released on September 14, 2010. Each following part was released every week following, up until the release of The Sacrifice in the games. It was eventually released for the iOS items iPhone and iPad. When asked whether more comics would be made by Valve, they stated in the affirmative, specifically saying that \"this isn’t the last you will see of Left 4 Dead comics.\" The full comic was published by Dark Horse Comics in \"Valve Presents: The Sacrifice and Other Steam-Powered Stories\", a volume along with other comics created by Valve for \"Team Fortress 2\" and \"Portal 2\", which was released in November 2011.\n\nGamesRadar's Tyler Nagata commented that, as of the second release, it was \"pretty great,\" praising it for its \"snarky dialogue and messy encounters with the special infected\". Kotaku's Michael McWhertor recommended it for fans of the series. Wired's Gus Mastrapa praised the beginning of the comic for \"capturing the frenetic action of the first-person shooter\". He adds that while he prefers that the video games do not go too much into the story, stating that the \"mystery makes the action feel that much more visceral\", he praised the execution for expanding the narrative in an outside medium without ruining the mystery. Destructoid's Nick Chester called it \"decent hype\" for the upcoming \"Left 4 Dead\" campaign. PC Gamer described them as \"thrilling\". At the start of the comics' releases, Rock Paper Shotgun's Kieron Gillen expressed interest, citing illustrator Michael Avon Oeming's \"fantastic\" visual storytelling. With the release of the second comic, fellow Rock Paper Shotgun editor Alec Meer emphatically recommended that readers read it, expressing \"mild frustration\" with the wait for the next comic. In a poll of what readers of the comic would like to see \"The Sacrifice\" released in, the choices were, in order of popularity: TV, computer, mobile device, and print. The supporting characters introduced in the comic have received some positive reception, with Valve citing an email they received asking if Annie, one of the soldiers accompanying the survivors, survived the zombie horde.\n\n"}

It is typically prevented by installing electronic article surveillance alarms at the doors. Library materials are tagged and if the tag is not deactivated it sounds an alarm. In some libraries with older or rare materials, readers are not allowed to take coats or bags into the reading area except for a few items in a clear plastic bag. Security cameras are not commonly used in libraries for privacy reasons.\n\nOne study commissioned in the UK estimated the average loss rate of libraries to theft at 5.3%.\n\nIn the U.S. state of Pennsylvania, the third conviction for library theft is a felony, regardless of the value of material.\n\nLibrary thieves, who may be staff or regular visitors of the library, risk being discovered if a book is found in the library catalog but missing from the shelves. To avoid this, some library thieves have been careful to also steal the catalog card describing the book.\n\nIn public libraries, librarians have noticed common themes in what subjects are most frequently stolen. Books with topics like sex and witchcraft are popular with thieves, as are guides for General Educational Development testing.\n\nIn a poll taken in 1996, the top three books that went missing were: \"The Joy of Sex\", GED Examination Books, and the \"Prophecies\" of Nostradamus.\n\nRare books departments of libraries especially fall target to professional thieves. In 1996, two rare early Mormon manuscripts were stolen from the Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County, when the thief requested the manuscript and replaced it with a facsimile.\n\nDocument theft is the crime of stealing documents of historical, literary, or cultural interest from public or private archives, often for the purpose of sale to private collectors. In many cases, document thieves occupy positions of trust, or have established records of legitimate accomplishment, prior to their crimes. Examples of notable convicted document thieves include former New York State archivist Daniel D. Lorello, Frede Møller-Kristensen, who between 1968 and 1978 stole some 1,600 historical books worth more than $50 million from the Danish National Library, and antiquities dealer E. Forbes Smiley III, who stole nearly 100 maps from libraries in the United States and Great Britain over the course of eight years. In addition to letters, maps, and other manuscript material, rare books also attract the attention of document thieves. John Charles Gilkey, for instance, stole hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of rare books over the course of many years. These crimes were largely the product of a personal obsession, illustrating the range of motives in document thefts.\n\n"}

For daylight photography, there is a similar rule called the Sunny 16 rule.\n\nThe basic rule is, \"For astronomical photos of the Moon's surface, set aperture to and shutter speed to the [reciprocal of the] ISO film speed [or ISO setting].\" \n\nAs with other light readings, shutter speed can be changed as long as the f-number is altered to compensate, e.g. 1/250 second at f/8 gives equivalent exposure to 1/125 second at f/11. Generally, the adjustment is done such that for each step in aperture increase (i.e., decreasing the f-number), the exposure time has to be halved (or equivalently, the shutter speed doubled), and vice versa. This follows the more general rule derived from the mathematical relationship between aperture and exposure time—within reasonable ranges, exposure is proportional to the square of the aperture ratio and proportional to exposure time; thus, to maintain a constant level of exposure, a change in aperture by a factor \"c\" requires a change in exposure time by a factor 1/\"c\"² and vice versa. Steps in aperture correspond to a factor close to the square root of two, thus the above rule.\n\nThe intensity of visible sunlight striking the surface of the Moon is essentially the same as at the surface of the Earth. The albedo of the Moon's surface material is lower (darker) than that of the earth's surface, and the Looney 11 rule increases exposure by one stop versus the Sunny 16 rule. Many photographers simply use the f/16-based Sunny 16 rule, unmodified, for lunar photographs.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "22523618", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22523618", "title": "Market Gate of Miletus", "text": "Market Gate of Miletus\n\nThe Market Gate of Miletus () is a large marble monument in the Pergamon Museum in Berlin, Germany. It was built in Miletus in the 2nd century AD and destroyed in an earthquake in the 10th or 11th century. In the early 1900s, it was excavated by a German archeological team, rebuilt, and placed on display in the museum in Berlin. Only fragments had survived and reconstruction involved significant new material, a practice which generated criticism of the museum. The gate was damaged in World War II and underwent restoration in the 1950s. Further restoration work took place in the first decade of the 21st century.\n\nThe gate is a large marble monument, about 30 meters wide, 16 meters tall, and 5 meters deep. The two-story structure has three doorways and a number of projections and niches. At roof level and in between the floors are ornate friezes with bull and flower reliefs. The structure's protruding pediments are supported by Corinthian and composite columns. The gate is not entirely original, as little of the base and lower floor survived the centuries; additional material includes brick, cement, and steel. The gate is affixed by iron girders to the wall behind it.\n\nWhile in Miletus, niches on the second story featured statues of emperors, some fighting against barbarians. \n\nThe gate was built in the 2nd century AD, most likely during the reign of Emperor Hadrian about 120 to 130 AD. It replaced an existing Doric propylon and served as the northern entrance to the southern market, or agora, in Miletus, an ancient city in what is now Turkey. The gate underwent restoration in the 3rd century following damage from an earthquake. When Justinian strengthened the defenses of Miletus in 538, the gate was incorporated into the city walls. In the 10th or 11th century, an earthquake caused the gate to collapse. Fragments of the structure were scavenged and used in surrounding buildings, but the majority subsided into the ground.\n\nGerman archaeologist Theodor Wiegand conducted a series of excavations in Miletus from 1899 through 1911. In 1903, the Market Gate of Miletus was excavated and from 1907 to 1908, fragments of the gate were transported to Berlin. Wiegand wrote in his diaries that he gave a presentation using models to Kaiser Wilhelm II, who was so impressed that he ordered the gate's reconstruction at full scale \"like a theater backdrop\" in the Pergamon Museum.\n\nFrom 1925 to 1929, the gate was reassembled in the recently expanded museum from over 750 tons of fragments. However, the fragments did not constitute the entirety of the gate, and fill material had to be used in the reconstruction. Reconstruction began by assembling the middle-floor entablature and placing the second story columns on top, followed by reconstructing the pediments. A base and ground floor were then inserted below. Brick and cement reinforced with steel supplemented the few remains of the lower structure. Original column fragments were bored out, leaving a thickness of , and filled with steel and mortar. In the 1920s and 1930s, the museum was criticized for portraying its monuments as originals when they consisted significantly of non-original material.\n\nThe gate suffered significant damage from aerial bombardment in World War II. The roof and skylight above the gate were destroyed along with a protective brick wall. The right wing collapsed and the structure was damaged by fire and shrapnel; the loss of the brick wall also exposed the gate to weathering for two years. After winter passed, a temporary roof was constructed to protect the gate from the elements. From 1952 to 1954, the structure was extensively restored under the supervision of archaeologist H. H. Völker. However, little documentation exists detailing what specific work took place.\nThe next major restoration work took place in the decade of the 2000s. The gate had deteriorated from a combination of indoor atmospheric effects and incompatible building materials. Fragments of the gate have spontaneously loosened and fallen, necessitating the addition of a fence in front of the structure to protect visitors. The state of the structure was documented prior to restoration, from about 2003 through 2004, including the production of three-dimensional photogrammetric models due to the gate's architectural complexity. In December 2005, scaffolding was erected around the structure with a transparent protective cover on the outside and within the entrance tunnel. The scaffolding and cover were removed in late 2008 following the initial restoration phase.\n\n"}
{"id": "323149", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=323149", "title": "Matter of Rome", "text": "Matter of Rome\n\nAccording to the medieval poet Jean Bodel, the Matter of Rome was the literary cycle made up of Greek and Roman mythology, together with episodes from the history of classical antiquity, focusing on military heroes like Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar. Bodel divided all the literary cycles he knew best into the Matter of Britain, the Matter of France and the Matter of Rome (although \"non-cyclical\" romance also existed). The Matter of Rome also included what is referred to as the Matter of Troy, consisting of romances and other texts based on the Trojan War and its after-effects, including the adventures of Aeneas.\n\nClassical topics were the subjects of a good deal of Old French literature, which in the case of Trojan subject matter ultimately deriving from Homer was built on scant sources; since the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\" were unknown, medieval Western poets had to make do with two short prose narratives based on Homer, ascribed to Dictys Cretensis and Dares Phrygius. The paucity of original text did not prevent the 12th century Norman poet Benoît de Sainte-Maure from writing a lengthy adaptation, \"Le Roman de Troie\", running 40,000 lines. The poems that were written on these topics were called the \"romans d'antiquité\", the \"romances of antiquity.\" This name presages the anachronistic approach the medieval poets used in dealing with these subjects. For example, in the epic poems \"Roman d'Alixandre\" and the \"Roman de Troie\", Alexander the Great, and Achilles and his fellow heroes of the Trojan War were treated as knights of chivalry, not much different from the heroes of the \"chansons de geste\". Elements of courtly love were introduced into the poems; in the \"Roman de Thèbes\", a romantic relationship absent from the Greek sources is introduced into the tale of Parthenopæus and Antigone. Military episodes in these tales were also multiplied, and used to introduce scenes of knight-errantry and tournaments. \n\nAnother example of French medieval poetry in this genre is the \"Eneas\", a treatment of the \"Aeneid\" that comes across as being a sort of burlesque of Virgil's poem. Sentimental and fantasy elements in the source material were multiplied, and incidents from Ovid, the most popular Latin poet of the Middle Ages, were mixed into the pastiche. The \"Philomela\" attributed to Chrétien de Troyes, a retelling of the story of Philomela and Procne, also takes its source from Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\".\n\nGeoffrey Chaucer's \"Troilus and Criseyde\" is an English example, with Chaucer adding many elements to emphasize its connection with the matter. He also brought the story into line with the precepts of courtly love.\n\nThis anachronistic treatment of elements from Greek mythology is similar to that of the Middle English narrative poem \"Sir Orfeo\", where the Greek Orpheus becomes the knight Sir Orfeo who rescues his wife Heurodis (i.e. Eurydice) from the fairy king.\n\n"}
{"id": "2780348", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2780348", "title": "Mujaddara", "text": "Mujaddara\n\nMujaddara ( \"mujadarah\", with alternative spellings in English majadra, mejadra, moujadara, mudardara, and megadarra) consists of cooked lentils together with groats, generally rice, and garnished with sautéed onions.\n\n\"Mujaddara\" is the Arabic word for \"pockmarked\"; the lentils among the rice resemble pockmarks. The first recorded recipe for \"mujaddara\" appears in \"Kitab al-Tabikh\", a cookbook compiled in 1226 by al-Baghdadi in Iraq. Containing rice, lentils, and meat, it was served this way during celebrations. Without meat, it was a medieval Arab dish commonly consumed by the poor, reputed to be a derivative of the \"mess of pottage\" Jacob used to buy Esau's birthright. Because of its importance in the diet, a saying in the Eastern Arab world is, \"A hungry man would be willing to sell his soul for a dish of mujaddara.\"\n\nCooked lentils are popular all over the Middle East and form the basis of many dishes. \"Mujaddara\" is a popular dish throughout the Arab world, and is generally made using brown or green lentils and rice, that can be seasoned with cumin, coriander, or mint. It is topped with fried onions and is generally served with yogurt, among other vegetables and side dishes, either hot or cold.\n\nThe dish is made with brown lentils and rice. In Lebanon, the word \"mjaddara\" refers to the puréed version of the dish, rather than the version with whole grains and lentils. \"Mjaddara\" usually has the consistency of rice pudding whereas in the Lebanese variant known as \"mudardara\", the rice and lentils remain relatively intact and distinct. Both \"mujaddara\" and \"mudardara\" are topped with caramelized onions and usually served with yogurt.\n\nParticularly in Palestine, rice is often replaced with bulgur; the dish is called M'jaddaret-Burghul to distinguish it from the M'jaddara which is served with rice. Pronounced as \"m'jaddara\", the dish is served multiple times a month for family, cooked with olive oil and onion strips, and served alongside local plain sheep's-milk yogurt (laban n'aj) made in Nablus, with green salad.\n\nArab Christians traditionally eat \"mujaddara\" during Lent. The dish is also popular among Jewish communities of Middle Eastern origin, in particular those of Syrian and Egyptian backgrounds; it is generally made with rice rather than wheat. It is sometimes nicknamed \"Esau's favourite\". Jews traditionally ate it twice a week: hot on Thursday evening, and cold on Sunday.\n\nIn Egyptian cuisine, lentils, rice, macaroni, and tomato sauce cooked together are known as kushari. In Indian cuisines, lentils cooked together with rice are known as khichdi (see also kedgeree). In Iranian cuisine, a similar dish composed of rice and lentils is called Addas Polo.\n\nIn Cypriot cuisine, the dish called \"fakes moutzentra\" is very similar to mujaddara, as it consists of lentils and rice. In Greek, \"fakes\" means lentils.\n\n\n"}

Promotional posters claim the film is based on actual events.\n\nThe script was written before \"Open Water\" (2003) was theatrically released. After \"Open Water\" became a success, \"Adrift\" was produced and the name was changed to \"Open Water 2: Adrift\" in some countries to capitalize on the success of the earlier film.\n\nA group of friends, Amy (Susan May Pratt), James (Richard Speight, Jr.), Zach (Niklaus Lange), Lauren (Ali Hillis), Dan (Eric Dane), and Dan's new girlfriend Michelle (Cameron Richardson) go for a weekend cruise on Dan's new yacht. Amy and James also bring their infant daughter, Sarah.\n\nMost of the friends decide to jump into the water for a swim. Amy, who is hydrophobic after a childhood incident, refuses but Dan picks her up and dives in with her. However, nobody thought to lower the ladder to re-board the ship, and so everyone (except the baby) is trapped in the water with only two masks, a dive knife, and a toy dolphin float. Despite their efforts, the side of the yacht is too smooth to climb and the deck is too high to reach. They see a boat of teenagers heading towards them. The group try to grab their attention, but the teenagers think that they are just greeting them, and sail off. During the struggle, the group try using a phone to call for help, only to hear the voices of some well wishers, unable to get the caller's attention. The phone accidentally gets knocked in the water.\n\nThey are left to tread water disconsolately. The group resorts to removing and using their bathing suits to make a rope. After a couple of attempts they manage to get one end of the rope wrapped around a railing. Instead of having the lightest person climb up, Zach attempts to climb. He pulls himself up and his fingers brush the gunwale but the makeshift rope rips apart as he is too heavy. The group are now mostly naked and have only a partial rope.\n\nMeanwhile, James goes underwater, and is fooling around with the prop, in an attempt to remove it and use it as a grappling hook, but he drops the knife. He swims down after it and manages to catch it, and desperately tries to swim for the surface. As he swims back up he crashes into the bottom of the boat, and is knocked unconscious. He resurfaces motionlessly and slightly bloodied with an apparent skull fracture. Zach gets the knife from James and starts stabbing the boat to climb back up. Dan tries to stop Zach, but accidentally stabs him, causing Zach to drop the knife.\n\nIn a fit of hysteria and fearing that sharks will be attracted by the blood, Michelle begins to swim away, but sinks underwater. Dan swims after her and sees her lifeless body drifting underwater. He dives after her, but he can't reach her, and her body disappears into the depths. After some time, Zach dies from blood loss in Lauren's arms. She reluctantly lets go of his body which floats away, face down. After much waiting, Lauren says she refuses to die treading water and attempts to swim back to shore to find help. Her fate after this is unknown.\n\nLater that night, during a rainstorm, James dies from his head injury. Dan unsuccessfully searches underwater for the knife. He slams his mask on the hull in frustration and the lens pops out. Remembering Zach's attempt with the knife, Dan uses it to wedge in the crevice of the side door for the ladder, giving him a handhold. Amy climbs over his shoulders, finally stepping onto his hand wrapped around the lens,causing him to yell as his hand bleeds more and manages to grab the gunwale and pull herself back on board. Once on board, she lowers the ladder for Dan and tends to her baby, Sarah. Amy notices Dan swimming away to drown out of guilt. She jumps back in to save him, reminding her of when she attempted to save her father in the same manner, at a young age.\n\nThe next morning, a fishing boat approaches the yacht, and notices the lowered ladder and life ring still floating in the water - no one had pulled them in. The yacht appears empty except for the sound of Sarah crying on the lower deck.\n\nThe film cuts to Amy standing on the boat in the sun, looking around appearing heartbroken. Dan is shown lying face down on the boat with a towel covering his lower half, seemingly sleeping.\n\n\n\"Open Water 2: Adrift\" received mixed reviews from critics.

{"id": "3792917", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3792917", "title": "Philosophy of technology", "text": "Philosophy of technology\n\nThe philosophy of technology is a sub-field of philosophy that studies the nature of technology and its social effects.\n\nPhilosophical discussion of questions relating to technology (or its Greek ancestor \"techne\") dates back to the very dawn of Western philosophy. The phrase \"philosophy of technology\" was first used in the late 19th century by German-born philosopher and geographer Ernst Kapp, who published a book titled \"Grundlinien einer Philosophie der Technik\".\n\nThe western term 'technology' comes from the Greek term \"techne\" (τέχνη) (art, or craft knowledge) and philosophical views on technology can be traced to the very roots of Western philosophy. A common theme in the Greek view of \"techne\" is that it arises as an imitation of nature (for example, weaving developed out of watching spiders). Greek philosophers such as Heraclitus and Democritus endorsed this view. In his Physics, Aristotle agreed that this imitation was often the case, but also argued that \"techne\" can go beyond nature and complete \"what nature cannot bring to a finish.\" Aristotle also argued that nature (\"physis\") and \"techne\" are ontologically distinct because natural things have an inner principle of generation and motion, as well as an inner teleological final cause. While \"techne\" is shaped by an outside cause and an outside \"telos\" (goal or end) which shapes it. Natural things strive for some end and reproduce themselves, while \"techne\" does not. In Plato's Timaeus, the world is depicted as being the work of a divine craftsman (Demiurge) who created the world in accordance with eternal forms as an artisan makes things using blueprints. Moreover, Plato argues in the Laws, that what a craftsman does is imitate this divine craftsman.\n\nDuring the period of the Roman empire and late antiquity authors produced practical works such as Vitruvius' \"De Architectura\" (1st century BC) and Agricola's \"De Re Metallica\" (1556). Medieval Scholastic philosophy generally upheld the traditional view of technology as imitation of nature. During the Renaissance, Francis Bacon became one of the first modern authors to reflect on the impact of technology on society. In his utopian work \"New Atlantis\" (1627), Bacon put forth an optimistic worldview in which a fictional institution (Salomon's House) uses natural philosophy and technology to extend man's power over nature - for the betterment of society, through works which improve living conditions. The goal of this fictional foundation is \"...the knowledge of causes, and secret motions of things; and the enlarging of the bounds of human empire, to the effecting of all things possible\".\n\nThe native German philosopher and geographer Ernst Kapp, who was based in Texas, published the fundamental book \"Grundlinien einer Philosophie der Technik\" in 1877. Kapp was deeply inspired by the philosophy of Hegel and regarded technique as a projection of human organs. In the European context, Kapp is referred to as the founder of the philosophy of technology.\n\nAnother, more materialistic position on technology which became very influential in the 20th-century philosophy of technology was centered on the ideas of Benjamin Franklin and Karl Marx.\n\nFive early prominent 20th-century philosophers to directly address the effects of modern technology on humanity were John Dewey, Martin Heidegger, Herbert Marcuse, Günther Anders and Hannah Arendt. They all saw technology as central to modern life, although Heidegger, Anders, Arendt and Marcuse were more ambivalent and critical than Dewey. The problem for Heidegger was the hidden nature of technology's essence, \"Gestell\" or \"Enframing\" which posed for humans what he called its greatest danger and thus its greatest possibility. Heidegger's major work on technology is found in \"The Question Concerning Technology\".\n\nContemporary philosophers with an interest in technology include Jean Baudrillard, Albert Borgmann, Andrew Feenberg, Langdon Winner, Donna Haraway, Avital Ronell, Brian Holmes, Don Ihde, Bruno Latour, Paul Levinson, Ernesto Mayz Vallenilla, Carl Mitcham, Leo Marx, Gilbert Simondon, Lewis Mumford, Jacques Ellul, Bernard Stiegler, Paul Virilio, Günter Ropohl, Nicole C. Karafyllis, Richard Sennett, and George Grant.\n\nWhile a number of important individual works were published in the second half of the twentieth century, Paul Durbin has identified two books published at the turn of the century as marking the development of the philosophy of technology as an academic subdiscipline with canonical texts. Those were \"Technology and the Good Life\" (2000), edited by Eric Higgs, Andrew Light, and David Strong and \"American Philosophy of Technology\" (2001) by Hans Achterhuis. Several collected volumes with topics in philosophy of technology have come out over the past decade and the journals \"\" (the journal of the Society for Philosophy and Technology, published by the Philosophy Documentation Center) and \"Philosophy & Technology\" (Springer) publish exclusively works in philosophy of technology. Philosophers of technology reflect broadly and work in the area and include interest on diverse topics of geoengineering, internet data and privacy, our understandings of internet cats, technological function and epistemology of technology, computer ethics, biotechnology and its implications, transcendence in space, and technological ethics more broadly.\n\nTechnological determinism is the idea that \"features of technology [determines] its use and the role of a progressive society was to adapt to [and benefit from] technological change.\" The alternative perspective would be social determinism which looks upon society being at fault for the \"development and deployment\" of technologies. Lelia Green used recent gun massacres such as the Port Arthur Massacre and the Dunblane Massacre to selectively show technological determinism and social determinism. According to Green, a technology can be thought of as a neutral entity only when the sociocultural context and issues circulating the specific technology are removed. It will be then visible to us that there lies a relationship of social groups and power provided through the possession of technologies.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18400571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18400571", "title": "Poseur", "text": "Poseur\n\nA \"poseur\" (or \"poser\") is someone who \"poses for effect, or behaves affectedly\", who \"affects a particular attitude, character or manner to impress others\", or who pretends to belong to a particular group. A poseur may be a \"person who pretends to be what he or she is not\" or an \"insincere person\"; they may have a flair for drama or behave as if they are onstage in daily life. \"Poseuse\", the feminine version of the word, is sometimes used.\n\n\"Poseur\" or \"poseuse\" is also used to mean a person who poses for an artist—a painter's model.\n\nThe playwright Oscar Wilde has been described as a \"poseur\". Thomas Hardy said of him, \"His early reputation as a poseur and fop – so necessary to his notoriety – recoiled upon the scholar and gentleman (as Wilde always innately was), and even upon the artist\".\n\nLord Alfred Douglas said of Wilde, \"That he had what passed for genius nobody will, I think, nowadays dispute, though it used to be the fashion to pooh-pooh him for a mere poseur and decadent.\"\n\nThe painter James A. Whistler has been sometimes described as a \"poseur\" for his manner and personal style. It has been suggested that Whistler's genius lay partly in his ability to cultivate the role of the poseur, to \"act as if he were always on stage\", in order to stir interest, and cause people to wonder how such a poseur could create work that was so serious and authentic. His fame as an artist seemed to require that he present himself as a poseur.\n\nThe playwright and critic, George Bernard Shaw, has been described as a poseur; in that context Shaw is quoted as saying, \"I have never pretended that G.B.S. was real ... The whole point of the creature is that he is unique, fantastic, unrepresentative, inimitable, impossible, undesirable on any large scale, utterly unlike anybody that ever existed before, hopelessly unnatural, and void of real passion.\"\n\nIn the ancient Greek comedy, \"The Clouds\", the playwright Aristophanes portrays Socrates as a \"poseur\".\n\nThe English term poseur is a loanword from French. The word in English use dates back to the mid 19th Century. It is from the French word \"poseur\", and from the Old French word \"poser\", meaning \"to put, place, or set\". The \"Online Etymology Dictionary\", suggests that \"poseur\" is in fact the English word \"poser\" dressed \"in French garb, and thus could itself be considered an affectation.\"\n\n\"Poseur\" is often a pejorative term, as used in the punk, heavy metal, hip hop, and goth subcultures, or the skateboarding, surfing and jazz communities, when it is used to refer to a person who copies the dress, speech, and/or mannerisms of a group or subculture, generally for attaining acceptability within the group or for popularity among various other groups, yet who is deemed not to share or understand the values or philosophy of the subculture.\nDavid Marsh, in an article in \"Rock & Rap\", speaking of \"those first punk kids in London\" says, \"The terms in which they expressed their disdain for hangers-on and those whose post-hip credentials didn't quite make it came straight out of the authenticity movements: \"Poseurs\" was the favorite epithet.” Ross Buncle argues that eventually the Australian punk scene \"opened the door to a host of poseurs, who were less interested in the music than in UK-punk fancy dress and being seen to be hip\". Describing a rehearsal of The Orphans, he says there \"were no punk-identikit poseurs\" present. A 2015 article about early punk subculture in \"The New Republic\" states that punk \"...was as immersive as a motorcycle gang or membership in the Mafia; part-time participants were derided as “poseurs,” while any deviation from orthodoxy was a “sellout\"...; this punk militancy created \"... an economic and social ghetto which was nearly impenetrable to corporate infiltration and which only adventurous or deranged souls dared enter.\"\n\nIn a review of The Clash film \"Rude Boy\", a critic argued that this \"film was another sign of how The Clash had sold out – a messy, vain work of punk poseurs\". US music journalist Lester Bangs praised punk pioneer Richard Hell for writing the \"strongest, truest rock & roll I have heard in ages\" without being an \"arty poseur\" of the \"age of artifice\". Another critic argues that by the late 1970s, \"punk rock had already, at this early date, shown signs of devolving into pure pose, black leather jacket and short hair required\". \"Please Kill Me\" includes interviews with punks in New York and Detroit who \"rip their English counterparts as a bunch of sissified poseurs\".\n\nThe term \"poseur\" was used in several late-1970s punk songs, including the X-Ray Spex song \"I Am a Poseur\", which included the lyrics \"I am a poseur and I don't care/I like to make people stare/Exhibition is the name.\"\nAnother song using the term was the Television Personalities song \"Part-Time Punks\". The Television Personalities' song \"was a reaction to the macho posturing of the English punk scene\". The lyrics argue that, \"while Television Personalities were not themselves punks in the orthodox sense, neither was anyone else\". The song \"declared that either everyone who wanted to be a punk was one or that everyone was a poseur (or both)\", and it argues that \"the concept of [...] punk rock authenticity, of Joe Strummer, was a fiction\".\n\nAn article in \"Drowned in Sound\" argues that 1980s-era \"hardcore is the true spirit of punk\" because \"[a]fter all the poseurs and fashionistas fucked off to the next trend of skinny pink ties with New Romantic haircuts, singing wimpy lyrics\". It argued that the hardcore scene consisted only of people \"completely dedicated to the DIY ethics\"; punk \"[l]ifers without the ambition to one day settle into the study-work-family-house-retirement-death scenario\".\n\nThe Oi band Combat 84 has a song entitled \"Poseur\" which describes a person changing from a punk to a skinhead, and then into a Mod and a Ted. The lyrics include the lines \"Poseur poseur standing there/You change your style every year.\"\n\nDave Rimmer writes that with the revival of punk ideals of stripped-down music in the early 1990s, with grunge musicians like \"[Kurt] Cobain, and lots of kids like him, rock & roll ... threw down a dare: Can you be pure enough, day after day, year after year, to prove your authenticity, to live up to the music [or else] live with being a poseur, a phony, a sellout?\"\n\nRefused's Dennis Lyxzén and Bad Religion's Brett Gurewitz used the term to refer to early 2000s-era pop punk fans as \"kids – more specifically the new wave of punk poseurs who came to the music via bands like Good Charlotte\". They argue that these young listeners want \"not to have to think and [instead they] would rather use music as escapism [,] and too many bands seem willing to comply\".\n\nOne writer argued that the Los Angeles punk scene was changed by the invasion of \"antagonistic suburban poseurs\", which bred \"rising violence [...] and led to a general breakdown of the hardcore scene\". A writer for \"The Gauntlet\" praised the US Bombs' politically oriented albums as \"a boulder of truth and authenticity in a sea of slick poseur sewage\", and called them \"real punk rockers\" at \"a time where the genre is littered with dumb songs about cars, girls and bong hits\".\n\nDaniel S. Traber argues that attaining authenticity in the punk identity can be difficult; as the punk scene changed and re-invented itself, \"[e]veryone got called a poseur\". One music writer argues that the punk scene produced \"...true believers who spent long days fighting the man on streets of the big city [and living in squats who] always wanted to make punk rock less a cultural movement than some kind of meritocracy: \"You have to prove you're good enough to listen to our music, man.\"\n\nJoe Keithley, the singer for D.O.A. said in an interview that: \"For every person sporting an anarchy symbol without understanding it there’s an older punk who thinks they’re a poseur.\" The interviewer, Liisa Ladouceur, argued that when a group or scene's \"followers grow in number, the original devotees abandon it, [...] because it is now attracting too many poseurs—people the core group does not want to be associated with\".\n\nThe early 1980s hardcore punk band MDC penned a song entitled \"Poseur Punk\", which excoriated pretenders who copied the punk look without adopting its values. The lyrics sheet packaged with Magnus Dominus Corpus, the album on which \"Poseur Punk\" appears, contains a picture of the band Good Charlotte juxtaposed underneath the lyrics to \"Poseur Punk\". As part of MDC's 25th anniversary tour in the 2000s, frontman \"Dictor's targets remain largely the same: warmongering politicians, money-grubbing punk poseurs (including Rancid, whose Tim Armstrong once worked as an M.D.C. roadie), and of course, cops\". \n\nNOFX's album \"The War on Errorism\" includes the song \"Decom-poseur\", part of the album's overall \"critique of punk rock's 21st century incarnation of itself\". In an interview, NOFX's lead singer Mike Burkett (aka \"Fat Mike\") \"lashes out\" at \"an entire population of bands he deems guilty of bastardizing a once socially feared and critically infallible genre\" of punk, asking \"[w]hen did punk rock become so safe?\"\n\nJeffrey Arnett argues that the heavy metal subculture classifies members into two categories: \"acceptance as an authentic metalhead or rejection as a fake, a poseur\". In a 1993 profile of heavy metal fans' \"subculture of alienation\", the author notes that the scene classified some members as poseurs, that is, heavy metal performers or fans who pretended to be part of the subculture but who were deemed to lack authenticity and sincerity. In 1986, \"SPIN\" magazine referred to \"poseur metal\". \n\nIn 2014, Stewart Taylor wrote that in the Bay Area thrash metal scene in the 1980s, in venues where bands like Exodus played, metal fans who liked \"hair metal\" bands such as \"Ratt, Motley Crue and Stryper\" were considered to be poseurs. A sociology book states that \"[t]rue [metal] fans separate themselves from the posers through devotion to the history of the genre as well as the history of the particular bands and artists.\"If a music fan came to an Exodus show at thrash clubs \"...with a Motley Crue shirt or a Ratt shirt, Paul Baloff [of Exodus] would literally tear that shirt off the person's back,\" and then the band would \"tear up the shirts and tie them around their wrists and wear them as trophies...[or]...badges of honor.\" As well, \"...Baloff would often command the audience to 'sacrifice a poseur'\", a ritual that involved the audience throwing the suspected hair metal fan onto the stage.\n\nThe Swedish black metal band Marduk, which aimed to be the \"...most brutal and blasphemous band ever\", uses Nazi imagery, such as the Nazi Panzer tank, in their songs and album art (e.g., their 1999 album is titled \"Panzer Division Marduk\"). This use of Nazi imagery offended neo-Nazi black metal bands, who called Marduk poseurs. \n\nIn the heavy metal subculture, some critics use the term to describe bands that are seen as excessively commercial, such as MTV-friendly glam metal groups in which hair, make-up, and fancy outfits are more important than the music. During the 1980s, thrash metal fans called pop metal bands \"metal poseurs\" or \"false metal\". Another metal subgenre, nu metal is seen as controversial amongst fans of other metal genres, and the genres detractors have labeled nu metal derogatory terms such as \"mallcore\", \"whinecore\", \"grunge for the zeros\" and \"sports-rock\". \nGregory Heaney of Allmusic has described the genre as \"one of metal's more unfortunate pushes into the mainstream.\" Jonathan Davis, the frontman of the pioneering nu metal band Korn, was in an interview and said \n\nRon Quintana wrote that when Metallica was trying to find a place in the LA metal scene in the early 1980s, it was difficult for the band to \"play their [heavy] music and win over a crowd in a land where poseurs ruled and anything fast and heavy was ignored\".\n\nDavid Rocher described Damian Montgomery, frontman of Ritual Carnage, as \"an authentic, no-frills, poseur-bashing, nun-devouring kind of gentleman, an enthusiastic metalhead truly in love with the lifestyle he preaches... and unquestionably practises\". In 2002, Josh Wood argued that the \"credibility of heavy metal\" in North America is being destroyed by the genre's demotion to \"horror movie soundtracks, wrestling events and, worst of all, the so-called 'Mall Core' groups like Slipknot and Korn\", which makes the \"true [metal] devotee's path to metaldom [...] perilous and fraught with poseurs.\"\n\nIn an article on Axl Rose, entitled \"Ex–'White-Boy Poseur'\", Rose admitted that he has had \"time to reflect on heavy-metal posturing\" of the last few decades: \"We thought we were so badass [...] Then N.W.A came out rapping about this world where you walk out of your house and you get shot. It was just so clear what stupid little white-boy poseurs we were.\"\n\nIn the Alestorm song \"Heavy Metal Pirates\", the song makes numerous metaphors and allusions to pirates, including references to cutlasses, and it includes the line \"No quarter for the poseurs, we'll bring 'em death and pain\". The Manowar song \"Metal Warriors\" includes the lines \"Heavy metal or no metal at all whimps and posers leave the hall\" and \"...all whimps and posers go on get out\".\n\nNancy Kilpatrick's \"Goth Bible: A Compendium for the Darkly Inclined\" defines \"poseur\" for the goth scene as: \"goth wannabes, usually young kids going through a goth phase who do not hold to goth sensibilities but want to be part of the goth crowd...\". Kilpatrick dismisses poseur goths as \"Batbabies\" whose clothing is bought at [mall store] Hot Topic with their parents' money.\n\nIn the hip hop scene, authenticity or \"street cred\" is important. The word wigger is the specific used to refer to caucasian people mimicking black hip-hop culture. Larry Nager of \"The Cincinnati Enquirer\" wrote that rapper 50 Cent has \"earned the right to use the trappings of gangsta rap – the macho posturing, the guns, the drugs, the big cars and magnums of champagne. He's not a poseur pretending to be a gangsta; he's the real thing.\"\n\nA \"This Are Music\" review of white rapper Rob Aston criticizes his \"fake-gangsta posturing\", calling him \"a poseur faux-thug cross-bred with a junk punk\" who glorifies \"guns, bling, cars, bitches, and heroin\" to the point that he seems like a parody. A 2004 article on BlackAmericaWeb claims that Russell Tyrone Jones, better known as rapper Ol' Dirty Bastard, was not \"a rough dude from the 'hood\" as his official record company biographies claimed. After Jones' death from drugs, the rapper's father claimed that \"his late son was a hip-hop poseur, contrary to what music trade magazines published in New York\" wrote. Jones' father argued that the \"story about him being raised in the Fort Greene [Brooklyn] projects on welfare until he was a child of 13 was a total lie\"; instead, he said \"their son grew up in a reasonably stable two-parent, two-income home in Brooklyn\".\n\nThe article also refers to another \"hip-hop poseur from a decade ago\", Lichelle \"Boss\" Laws. While her record company promoted her as \"the most gangsta of girl gangstas\", posing her \"with automatic weapons\" and publicizing claims about prison time and an upbringing on the \"hard-knock streets of Detroit\", Laws' parents claim that they put her \"through private school and enrolled [her] in college in suburban Detroit\".\n\nAs hip hop has gained a more mainstream popularity, it has spread to new audiences, including well-to-do \"white hip-hop kids with gangsta aspirations—dubbed the 'Prep-School Gangsters'\" by journalist Nancy Jo Sales. Sales claims that these hip hop fans \"wore Polo and Hilfiger gear trendy among East Coast hip-hop acts\" and rode downtown to black neighborhoods in chauffeured limos to experience the ghetto life. Then, \"to guard against being labeled poseurs, the prep schoolers started to steal the gear that their parents could readily afford\". This trend was highlighted in The Offspring song \"Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)\".\n\nA 2008,\" Utne Reader\" article describes the rise of \"Hipster Rap\", which \"consists of the most recent crop of MCs and DJs who flout conventional hip-hop fashions, eschewing baggy clothes and gold chains for tight jeans, big sunglasses, the occasional keffiyeh, and other trappings of the hipster lifestyle\". The article says this \"hipster rap\" has been criticized by the hip hop website Unkut and rapper Mazzi, who call the mainstream rappers \"poseurs\" or \"fags for copping the metrosexual appearances of hipster fashion\". \"Prefix Mag\" writer Ethan Stanislawski argues that there \"have been a slew of angry retorts to the rise of hipster rap\", which he says can be summed up as \"white kids want the funky otherness of hip-hop [...] without all the scary black people\".\n\nAfrican-American hip hop artist Azealia Banks has criticized Iggy Azalea, a white rapper, \"for failing to comment on 'black issues', despite capitalising on the appropriation of African American culture in her music.\" Banks has called her a \"wigger,\" and there have been \"accusations of racism\" focused on her \"insensitivity to the complexities of race relations and cultural appropriation.\"\n\nMark Paytress writes that in 1977, Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger called singer/songwriter Patti Smith a \"poseur of the worst kind, intellectual bullshit, trying to be a street girl\". A music writer for \"The Telegraph\" called Bob Dylan an \"actor and a rock 'n' roll poseur to rival David Bowie and Mick Jagger at their most flamboyant\".\n\nThe skateboarding subculture attempts to differentiate between authentic skaters and pretenders. A \"New York Times\" article on the 2007 skateboarding scene notes that \"some first-time skaters drawn into the sport by catchy choruses or candy-colored sneakers are dismissed as poseurs\" who are \"walking around with a skateboard as an accessory, holding it in a way we call 'the mall grab.'\" In the 1988 video game \"Skate or Die!\", \"Poseur Pete\" is the name of the challenger for beginner-level players.\n\nAn \"LA City Beat\" magazine writer argues that \"dance music had its \"Spinal Tap\" moment some time around the year 2000\", arguing that \"the prospect of fame, groupies, and easy money by playing other people's records on two turntables brought out the worst poseurs since hair metal ruled the Sunset Strip. Every dork with spiky locks and a mommy-bought record bag was a self-proclaimed turntable terror.\" A \"Slate\" magazine article argues that while the independent music scene \"can embrace some fascinating hermetic weirdos such as Joanna Newsom or Panda Bear, it's also prone to producing fine-arts-grad poseurs such as The Decemberists and poor-little-rich-boy-or-girl singer songwriters\".\n\nIn 1986, \"SPIN\" magazine referred to \"poseur bikers\", individuals who ride motorcycles and wear biker clothing, yet who lack the missing teeth and scars of real bikers. An obituary for Colorado motorcycle enthusiast Walt Hankinson stated that “[h]e was an old-time biker, not a poseur\", because he \"...wasn’t looking for the most stylish leather outfit and never had a fashion crisis about what to wear on the next ride,” instead just wearing a \"flannel shirt, jeans and a cloth jacket\" when he rode his motorcycle.\n\nIn Canada, there are \"alleged military posers\", individuals who wear army uniforms and medals, who are not actually current or previous members of the armed forces. In November 2014, Ottawa police charged one of these alleged poseurs for impersonating a soldier, after he appeared in TV interviews during Remembrance Day ceremonies wearing a uniform and medals which he had no right to wear.\n\nThe concept of a \"jazz poseur\" dates back to the 1940s. Bob White from \"Downbeat\" argued that some jazz critics knew nothing about new jazz (bebop) and nothing about chords, tone, or the technical aspects of jazz; instead, they would just learn the names of a few old masters and \"...become a romantic, a charlatan, a poseur, a pseudo-intellectual, an aesthetic snob, ...well on the way to success\" as a jazz critic. In the 2000s, the CBC produced a radio show about how to spot \"jazz poseurs\" in a jazz scene. These were described as people who do not know much about the music, but they can \"name-drop\" the names of famous performers.\n\n\"Salon\" writer Joan Walsh calls US politician Paul Ryan a Randian poseur. She claims that while he purports to believe in Ayn Rand's Objectivist philosophy, which harshly criticizes government social redistribution programs, he actually benefitted from these programs in his life.\n\nPoseurs in the realm of sneakers and fashion have even been given their own name: hypebeast. First coined in 2007 on forums like NikeTalk, which were the social media of that time, these people are said to \"collect clothing, shoes, and accessories for the sole purpose of impressing others.\" As opposed to the sneakerhead who purchases and collects shoes because he likes them, a hypebeast will only purchase a pair that is very popular among others and they gauge their self worth only on how many likes they can get on their #OOTD (outfit of the day) Instagram post with that coveted pair of sneakers on.\n\nIn furnishing parlance, a \"poseur table\" is a high, small table, used by a standing person to place a drink or snacks on while they talk to other people. Poseur tables are used in bars, lounges, clubs and convention centres. Poseur tables facilitate conversation and mingling at social events, because guests are not restricted by fixed seating and they can move about more freely. Some poseur tables are used with high stools.\n\n\nHistorical:\n\nGeneral:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3076576", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3076576", "title": "Public morality", "text": "Public morality\n\nPublic morality refers to moral and ethical standards enforced in a society, by law or police work or social pressure, and applied to public life, to the content of the media, and to conduct in public places. A famous remark of Mrs Patrick Campbell, that she did not care what people did as long as they \"didn't frighten the horses\" shows that in some sense even high tolerance expects a \"public\" limitation on behaviour (sexual conduct is implied here). At the opposite extreme a theocracy may equate public morality with religious instruction, and give both the equal force of law.\n\nPublic morality often means regulation of sexual matters, including prostitution and homosexuality, but also matters of dress and nudity, pornography, acceptability in social terms of cohabitation before marriage, and the protection of children. It is a main justification for censorship; it can lead to campaigns against profanity, and so be at odds with freedom of speech. Gambling is generally controlled: casinos have been considered much more of a threat than large-scale lotteries or football pools. Public drunkenness is quite unacceptable in some societies, and legal control of consumption of alcohol is often justified in terms of public morality, just as much as for medical reasons or to limit alcohol-related crime. Drug legislation, historically speaking, has sometimes followed on similar reasoning. Abortion is sometimes treated as an aspect of public morality, even if it is legally defined, regulated by medical professionals, and almost entirely hidden from public view. AIDS as a health policy issue is linked to public morality in a complicated manner.\n\nViews on public morality do change over time. For example, there have been proscriptions against eating in the street or allowing women to smoke in public. These examples show that public views on which things which are acceptable often move towards wider tolerance. Rapid shifts the other way are often characterised by moral panics, as in the shutting down of theatres a generation after Shakespeare's death by the English Puritans.\n\nIt may also be applied to the \"morals of public life\". Political corruption, or the telling of lies in public statements, tarnish not only individual politicians, but the entire conduct of political life, whether at local or national level. These are fairly universally regarded as blots on reputations, though in some cases there is a grey area between corruption and legitimate fund-raising. Whether the private lives of politicians are a public morals issue is not a matter of agreement, internationally speaking; the existence of an extramarital relationship of a Prime Minister would in some countries be considered a revelation well within the sphere of the public interest, while in other countries it would be considered quite irrelevant.\n\n"}
{"id": "12082329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12082329", "title": "Science in newly industrialized countries", "text": "Science in newly industrialized countries\n\nScientific research is concentrated in the developed world, with only a marginal contribution from the rest of the world. Most Nobel Laureates are either from United States, Europe, or Japan. Many newly industrialized countries have been trying to establish scientific institutions, but with limited success. There is an insufficient dedicated, inspired and motivated labor pool for science and insufficient investment in science education.\n\nThe reason that there have been so few scientists, who have made their mark globally, from most NIC's (Newly Industrialized Countries) is partly historical and partly social A true scientist is nurtured from the school up wards to scientific establishments. Only, if there are inspired and dedicated school science teachers in abundance, there will be sufficient number of inspired students who would like to take science as a career option and who may one day become a successful scientist.\n\nA common thread can indeed be discerned in the state of science in many NICs. Thus although, most of the science establishments in the major NICs can be said to be doing fairly well, none of them have been as successful as the developed countries.\n\nAfter the Second World War, a small technical elite arose in developing countries such as India, Pakistan, Brazil, and Iraq who had been educated as scientists in the industrialized world. They spearheaded the development of science in these countries, presuming that by pushing for Manhattan project-type enterprises in nuclear power, electronics, pharmaceuticals, or space exploration they could leapfrog the dismally low level of development of science establishments in their countries. India, for example, started a nuclear energy program that mobilized thousands of technicians and cost hundreds of millions of dollars but had limited success. Though China, North Korea, India and Pakistan have been successful in deploying nuclear weapons and some of them e.g. China and India have launched fairly successful space programs, (for example, Chandrayaan I (\"Sanskrit\" चंद्रयान-1), which literally means \"Moon Craft,\" is an unmanned lunar mission by the Indian Space Research Organisation and it hopes to land a motorised rover on the moon in 2010 or 2011 as a part of its second Chandrayaan mission; Chang'e I, China's moon probing project is proceeding in full swing in a well-organized way), the fact remains that most of the scientists responsible for these deeds had received their terminal education from some institution or university in US or Europe. In addition there have been hardly any Nobel laureates in science who have conducted the path-breaking research in a native science establishment.\n\nBrazilian science effectively began in the 19th century, until then, Brazil was a poor colony, without universities, printing presses, libraries, museums, etc. This was perhaps a deliberate policy of the Portuguese colonial power, because they feared that the appearance of educated Brazilian classes would boost nationalism and aspirations toward political independence.\n\nThe first attempts of having a Brazilian science establishment were made around 1783, with the expedition of Portuguese naturalist Alexandre Rodrigues, who was sent by Portugal's prime minister, the Marquis of Pombal, to explore and identify Brazilian fauna, flora and geology. His collections, however, were lost to the French, when Napoleon invaded, and were transported to Paris by Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. In 1772, the first learned society, the Sociedade Scientifica, was founded in Rio de Janeiro, but lasted only until 1794. Also, in 1797, the first botanic institute was founded in Salvador, Bahia. In the second and third decades of the twentieth century, the main universities in Brazil were organised from a set of existing medical, engineering and law schools. The University of Brazil dates from 1927, the University of São Paulo - today the largest in the Country - dates from 1934.\n\nToday, Brazil has a well-developed organization of science and technology. Basic research in science is largely carried out in public universities and research centers and institutes, and some in private institutions, particularly in non-profit non-governmental organizations. More than 90% of funding for basic research comes from governmental sources.\n\nApplied research, technology and engineering is also largely carried out in the university and research centers system, contrary-wise to more developed countries such as the United States, South Korea, Germany, Japan, etc. A significant trend is emerging lately. Companies such as Motorola, Samsung, Nokia and IBM have established large R&D&I centers in Brazil. One of the incentive factors for this, besides the relatively lower cost and high sophistication and skills of Brazilian technical manpower, has been the so-called Informatics Law, which exempts from certain taxes up to 5% of the gross revenue of high technology manufacturing companies in the fields of telecommunications, computers, digital electronics, etc. The Law has attracted annually more than 1,5 billion dollars of investment in Brazilian R&D&I. Multinational companies have also discovered that some products and technologies designed and developed by Brazilians are significantly competitive and are appreciated by other countries, such as automobiles, aircraft, software, fiber optics, electric appliances, and so on.\n\nThe challenges Brazilian science faces today are: to expand the system with quality, supporting the installed competence; transfer knowledge from the research sector to industry; embark on government action in strategic areas; enhance the assessment of existing programmes and commence innovative projects in areas of relevance for the Country. Furthermore, scientific dissemination plays a fundamental role in transforming the perception of the public at large of the importance of science in modern life. The government has undertaken to meet these challenges using institutional base and the operation of existing qualified scientists.\n\nA question that has been intriguing many historians studying China is the fact that China did not develop a scientific revolution and Chinese technology fell behind that of Europe. Many hypotheses have been proposed ranging from the cultural to the political and economic. has argued that China indeed had a scientific revolution in the 17th century and that we are still far from understanding the scientific revolutions of the West and China in all their political, economic and social ramifications. Some like John K. Fairbank are of the opinion that the Chinese political system was hostile to scientific progress.\n\nNeedham argued, and most scholars agreed, that cultural factors prevented these Chinese achievements from developing into what could be called \"science\". It was the religious and philosophical framework of the Chinese intellectuals which made them unable to believe in the ideas of laws of nature. More recent historians have questioned political and cultural explanations and have focused more on economic causes. Mark Elvin's high level equilibrium trap is one well-known example of this line of thought, as well as Kenneth Pomeranz' argument that resources from the New World made the crucial difference between European and Chinese development.\n\nThus, it was not that there was no order in nature for the Chinese, but rather that it was not an order ordained by a rational personal being, and hence there was no conviction that rational personal beings would be able to spell out in their lesser earthly languages the divine code of laws which he had decreed aforetime. The Taoists, indeed, would have scorned such an idea as being too naive for the subtlety and complexity of the universe as they intuited it. Similar grounds have been found for questioning much of the philosophy behind traditional Chinese medicine, which, derived mainly from Taoist philosophy, reflects the classical Chinese belief that individual human experiences express causative principles effective in the environment at all scales. Because its theory predates use of the scientific method, it has received various criticisms based on scientific thinking. Even though there are physically verifiable anatomical or histological bases for the existence of acupuncture points or meridians, for instance skin conductance measurements show increases at the predicted points.\n\nToday, science and technology establishment in the People's Republic of China is growing rapidly. Even as many Chinese scientists debate what institutional arrangements will be best for Chinese science, reforms of the Chinese Academy of Sciences continue. The average age of researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences has dropped by nearly ten years between 1991 and 2003. However, many of them are educated in the United States and other foreign countries.\n\nChinese university undergraduate and graduate enrollments more than doubled from 1995 to 2005. The universities now have more cited PRC papers than CAS in the Science Citation Index. Some Chinese scientists say CAS is still ahead on overall quality of scientific work but that lead will only last five to ten years.\n\nSeveral Chinese immigrants to the United States have also been awarded the Nobel Prize, including:, Samuel C. C. Ting, Chen Ning Yang, Tsung-Dao Lee, Yuan T. Lee, Daniel C. Tsui, and Gao Xingjian. Other overseas ethnic Chinese that have achieved success in sciences include Fields Medal recipient Shing-Tung Yau and Terence Tao, and Turing Award recipient Andrew Yao. Tsien Hsue-shen was a prominent scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, while Chien-Shiung Wu contributed to the Manhattan Project (some argue she never received the Nobel Prize unlike her colleagues Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen Ning Yang due to sexism by the selection committee). Others include Charles K. Kao, a pioneer in fiber optics technology, and Dr. David Ho, one of the first scientists to propose that AIDS was caused by a virus, thus subsequently developing combination antiretroviral therapy to combat it. Dr. Ho was named TIME magazine's 1996 Man of the Year. In 2015, Tu Youyou, a pharmaceutical chemist, became the first native Chinese scientist, born and educated and carried out research exclusively in the People's Republic of China, to receive the Nobel Prize in natural sciences.\n\nThe earliest applications of science in India took place in the context of medicine, metallurgy, construction technology (such as ship building, manufacture of cement and paints) and in textile production and dyeing. But in the process of understanding chemical processes, led to some theories about physical processes and the forces of nature that are today studied as specific topics within the fields of chemistry and physics.\n\nMany mathematical concepts today were contributed by Indian mathematicians like Aryabhata.\n\nThere was really no place for scientists in the Indian caste system. Thus while there were/are castes for the learned brahmins, the warriors kshatriyas, the traders vaishyas and the menial workers shudras, maybe even the bureaucrats (the kayasths) there was/is hardly any formal place in the social hierarchy for a people who discover new knowledge or invent new devices based on the recently discovered knowledge, even though scientific temper has always been in India, in the form of logic, reasoning and method of acquiring knowledge. Its therefore no wonder that some Indians quickly learned to value science, especially those belonging to the privileged Brahmin caste during the British colonial rule that lasted over two centuries. Some Indians did succeed to achieve notable success and fame, examples include Satyendra Nath Bose, Meghnad Saha, Jagdish Chandra Bose and C. V. Raman even though they belonged to different castes. The science communication had begun with publication of a scientific journal, Asiatick Researches in 1788. Thereafter, the science communication in India has evolved in many facets. Following this, there has been a continuing development in the formation of scientific institutions and publication of scientific literature. Subsequently, scientific publications also started appearing in Indian languages by the end of eighteenth century. The publication of ancient scientific literature and textbooks at mass scale started in the beginning of nineteenth century. The scientific and technical terms, however, had been a great difficulty for a long time for popular science writing.\n\n\n"}

The \"close\" worlds are almost identical to \"our\" Earth (referred to as \"Datum Earth\"), others differ in greater and greater details, but all share one similarity: on none are there, or have there ever been, \"Homo sapiens\" – although the same cannot be said of earlier hominid species, especially \"Homo habilis\".\n\nThe book deals primarily with the journey of Joshua Valienté (a natural \"Stepper\") and Lobsang, who claims to be a Tibetan motorcycle repairman reincarnated as an artificial intelligence. The two chart a course to learn as much as possible about the parallel worlds, travelling millions of steps away from the original Earth. They encounter evidence of other humanoid species (referred to as trolls and elves); of human settlers who learned their gifts early – including Sally Linsay, daughter of the inventor of the stepper, who joins them on their expedition; and of an extinct race of bipedal dinosaur descendants. They also encounter warning signs of a great danger, millions of worlds away from \"our\" Earth, causing catastrophe as it moves. The book also deals with the effects of the explosion of available space on the people of Datum Earth and the new colonies and political movements that are spreading in the wake of Step Day.\n\nA young girl, Helen Green, and her family (with the exception of her brother, Rod, who is unable to step) trek across the long earth to form a new community, Reboot, on Earth West 101,754.\n\nAfter stepping across \"The Gap\" – a universe around two million steps from the Datum where the earth no longer exists – Joshua and Lobsang encounter the threat that has caused the slow migration of Trolls away from the gap. First Person Singular is a being that absorbs other sentient life forms, eventually taking over everything on earth before stepping to the next. It currently cannot pass The Gap. Lobsang elects to stay in First Person Singular's universe and commune with it, in the hopes of convincing it not to advance further, or at least to not absorb all other sentients.\n\nJoshua and Sally return to Datum Earth back the way they came. Upon reaching Earth West 101,754, they hear news that Datum Madison has been destroyed in a nuclear explosion, the result of a bomb planted by a terrorist group of humans incapable of stepping (called \"phobics\" in the book's terminology). The book ends with the two of them briefly seeing the explosion site, before retreating to Earth West 1 Madison, where a backed-up instantiation of Lobsang contacts Joshua by phone.\n\n\nReviewing the book in\" The Guardian\", Adam Roberts found it to be \"much more like a Baxter novel than a Pratchett one.\" It was also said to be \"a charming, absorbing and somehow spacious piece of imagineering.\"\n\nThe book reached 13th on the \"New York Times\" hardback best-sellers list on 8 July 2012.\n\nThe novel won the Goodreads Choice Awards 2012 for Science Fiction.\n\nSequels of the novel in the series are:\n\n\n"}

It aired in the United States on Fox on October 22, 2017.\n\nThe Simpson family is on a plate, as part of candies distributed on Halloween at a house. Bart as a Butterfinger bar is afraid of being taken, Marge as a Mars bar comforts him saying he's always the last taken, and Homer, an Oh Henry! bar saying even a box of stale raisins gets taken before him. Nelson as a Crunch bar and Kirk as a Turkish Taffy bar get taken, and Lisa as an apple complains about no one ever wanting the apples, as people are afraid of razor blades being inside her. Marge comforts her saying they take them only when dipped in caramel, to the apple's disgust. Shauna takes the Junior Mints, after Homer moved aside, and eats its contents.\n\nThe next day, the family are the only ones left, and they get placed on a shelf when the family remove the Halloween decorations, where they find a chocolate Easter bunny, that tells them they'll be left there forgotten. Seeing his discomfort as no one ever takes him, Homer starts eating him. Marge tries to stop him, but he tells her chocolate doesn't feel anything, and resumes eating it, with the rest of the family joining in when he eats the bunny's mouth to shut it up. The camera pans to the wall, where The Simpsons Easter Special is written, but the chocolate from the bunny splatters all over it, covering the words, and dark chocolate resembling blood spells out \"Treehouse of Horror XXVIII\".\n\nOn a pre-Christian temple site in northern Iraq (a parody of the opening scene of \"The Exorcist\"), a Pazuzu statue is dug up and sent through Amazon to the Simpsons home due to Homer accidentally ordering it, thinking it said \"pizza\". After Homer sings a very disturbing lullaby with glowing red eyes, the statue is left on Maggie's bed as the demon within it possesses Maggie, with the possessed infant making her presence known during the cocktail party that Homer and Marge are hosting downstairs. The demon kills a complaining Helen Lovejoy before locking everyone in and then killing Dr. Hibbert while revealing that he is cheating on his wife. Ned Flanders tells the Simpsons that Maggie needs an exorcism before being killed himself from being beaten up and choking on a toy car. An Irish priest arrives soon after, and performs the exorcism that purges the demon from Maggie, but the demon ends up possessing Bart, which he fearfully regrets, declaring that Bart has the evilest soul he's ever seen and is \"worse than David Schwimmer\".\n\nIn a parody of \"Coraline\", Maggie is still recovering from Pazuzu while starting to violently vomit all over the dinner table, eventually flooding the kitchen with puke. In Lisa's room, Snowball V (Neil Gaiman) takes her through a secret tunnel that brings her to another version of the family, with pink buttons instead of eyes on their faces. While the alternate family are like a dream, Lisa runs back to her world in terror when she learns they want to sew buttons on her eyes so she can remain with them forever. Lisa reconsiders the alternate family's offer after Homer had killed a snake with Lisa's saxophone.\n\nA few days later, the family finally realizes Lisa is missing with Homer accepting it and saying Maggie gets Lisa's room and clothes, while Bart gets her homework. Upon hearing this, Bart escapes through the door and is accepted in the alternate reality. After Marge follows after her children, Homer follows suit and a meeting with the alternate family results with him killing the alternate Bart while alternate Homer injures himself on a pair of scissors trying to avenge him. This infuriates alternate Marge as she transforms into an eight-legged spider-like creature to attack Homer, who decides to take advantage of the situation to benefit himself: bringing the surviving members of the alternate family home with his alternate counterpart attending parent-teacher meetings while alternate Marge does the chores and guards the house. Lisa accepts this outcome, claiming that it could have been much worse.\n\nAn opening scene features Lisa warning viewers about the following segment’s disgusting content, proclaiming, \"What you're about to see is so disgusting, you'll watch Game of Thrones to calm down!\" The episode then begins when a Homer remains home while the rest of the family go on vacation with Patty and Selma. Homer gets comfy, but ends up eating his food supplies, ending up with only vegetables before finding a frozen hot dog. Losing the hot dog to Santa's Little Helper, Homer accidentally cuts his finger off while grilling. He cooks the finger and eats it. He discovers how tasty it is, losing interest in other food when invited by Ned for lunch, and starts cooking parts of his body before his family come back. They become suspicious with Homer constantly wearing oven mitts to hide his severed fingers, being 20 pounds thinner, and walking with a limp. When Marge discovered Homer's self-cannibalism one night while he was frying his own severed leg, she takes him to an addiction counselor for help, but Mario Batali, in search for new ingredients, convinces a despondent (and now missing the entire lower half of his body) Homer to cook his remaining body parts as ingredients sold at Chez Homer and several other restaurants across Springfield. Carl mentions that they are also eating Barney Gumble, Comic Book Guy, and horse meat. In Heaven, Homer comments to Jesus how he now shares people eating his body with him, as the Springfield residents have turned into cannibals.\n\nThis episode received mostly positive reviews. Dennis Perkins of \"The A.V. Club\" gave the episode a B- stating, \"The 28th ‘Treehouse Of Horror’ carries on the venerable Simpsons institution by, as ever, tossing a whole lot of stuff at the screen and seeing what sticks. To that end, this year’s outing gives us: An 'Exorcist' parody, a 'Coraline’ parody, Homer eating human flesh (just his own, but still), stop-motion segments, horror and fantasy-specific guest stars, a little light Fox standards-pushing (Homer does, as stated, eat human flesh), and the usual string of hit-or-miss gags. That last part isn’t really a criticism in itself. Freed up from the need to calibrate the heart-yucks equation, a ‘Treehouse Of Horror’ rises or falls on the strength of its jokes, although the annual Halloween anthology provides its own unique degree of difficulty.\"\n\nJesse Schedeen of \"IGN\" gave the episode an 8.6 out of 10 stating, \"The ‘Treehouse of Horror’ specials are rarely among the more memorable episodes in any given season of The Simpsons. However, Season 29 is likely to be a major exception. All three segments in this year's special were strong. The series finally plugged two major holes in its huge collection of horror movie parodies while also reminding us that it can offend and disturb with the best of them. Perhaps there's still more mileage to be found in this long-running Simpsons trope.\"\n\nTony Sokol of \"Den of Geek\" gave the episode four out of five stars stating, \"’Treehouse of Horror XXVIII’ had chills and spills, which Marge, of course, has to clean, but the thrills were only middling. It was a very funny episode, yes. It took chances, like leaving a kid alone with a catholic priest, but ultimately doesn’t reach the dizzying highs, terrifying lows nor the creamy middles of Halloweens past. It’s better than a Butterfinger, but doesn’t have a long-enough lasting aftertaste.\"\n\n\"Treehouse of Horror XXVIII\" scored a 1.6 rating with a 6 share and was watched by 3.66 million people, making it Fox's highest rated show of the night.\n\n"}

The eighth and final season will premiere on December 14, 2018, and will consist of thirteen episodes. \n\nFor millennia, the Galra Empire has plagued the universe by destroying other civilizations and enslaving various races. The only known threat strong enough against the empire's power and plans is the legendary \"Defender of the Universe\" Voltron, a 100-meter tall robot warrior composed of five lion mechas whose pilots are known as the Paladins. At the crux of the war that ended with the destruction of planet Altea, Voltron was separated by King Alfor of Altea in order to protect Voltron from falling into the Galran evil Emperor Zarkon's possession. King Alfor bonded the five lion's energies to his daughter Allura's life force and sent them across the universe to different locations until the time for the next generation of Paladins to appear and pilot Voltron arrived. Princess Allura, her royal advisor Coran, and the Altean Castle of Lions were hidden on planet Arus along with the Black Lion.\n\nIn the present, the Galra Empire's path of conquest and search for Voltron has led them to Earth's solar system. A group of space pilots – Shiro, Keith, Lance, Pidge, and Hunk – discover the Blue Lion and immediately get swept up into the Galran War. They meet Princess Allura, become the new Paladins, and reunite the five lions to form Voltron, beginning their fight to liberate the universe from the Galra Empire.\n\n\n\nOn January 5, 2016, Netflix and DreamWorks Animation announced a new original animated \"Voltron\" series to debut in 2016 as an expansion of their existing multi-year agreement. \"Voltron\" was one of several series planned for initial development and debut in 2016, including Guillermo del Toro's animated \"Trollhunters\". Lauren Montgomery and Joaquim Dos Santos, both known for their work on the \"\" and its sequel \"The Legend of Korra\", served as showrunners while fellow crew member Tim Hedrick served as head writer. On March 25, 2016, at WonderCon it was announced that the voice cast would consist of Steven Yeun as Keith, Jeremy Shada as Lance, Bex Taylor-Klaus as Pidge, Josh Keaton as Shiro, Tyler Labine as Hunk, Kimberly Brooks as Princess Allura; and Rhys Darby as Coran and Neil Kaplan as King Zarkon. Cree Summer later confirmed that she would be voicing Witch Haggar. The first season premiered on June 10, 2016, and consisted of 13 episodes.\n\nIt was announced at San Diego Comic-Con that season two will premiere on Netflix in late 2016. A few months later, at New York Comic Con, it was announced that the second season will premiere on January 20, 2017. The second season saw a special premiere at the New York Comic Con in October 7, 2016, where an episode was shown at the \"Voltron\" panel. The second season premiered on Netflix on January 20, 2017, and consisted of 13 episodes.\n\nThe third season premiered on Netflix on August 4, 2017, and consisted of 7 episodes.

Sarah Moran of ScreenRant gave a positive review of the first. Moran wrote, “It isn’t trying to reinvent or really improve on the original conceit of Voltron, but Legendary Defender is certainly a welcomed take on a classic cartoon; one that should appeal to fans both new and old.” Shamus Kelly from Den of Geek gave the series 5 stars out of 5. Kelly wrote, “Seriously, you won’t be disappointed. It’s something special that doesn’t come around often in television.”\n\nThree comic series detailing events happening in between episodes were announced in January 2016.

The \"walima\" is performed after the \"nikah\" () or marriage ceremony. The word \"walima\" is derived from \"awlam\", meaning to gather or assemble. It designates a feast in Arabic. \"Walima\" is used as a symbol to show domestic happiness in the household post-marriage. While walima is often used to describe a celebration of marriage, it is also held to celebrate the birth of a newborn and the purchase of a new home.\n\nScholars have different views on what the correct time of \"walima\" is. The timing varies by culture and opinion; for example some believe it should take place:\n\nWalima in literal translation means \"to assemble\" and is used to describe an assembly or party celebrating major life events. Walima is essentially interchangeable with American and English terms such as: wedding reception or celebration (when held to celebrate a marriage), birthday party (when held to celebrate the birth of a newborn), or housewarming party (when held to celebrate the purchase of a new home). Similarly, walima is generally interchangeable with other languages/cultures terms that essentially mean to assemble for the purposes of celebrating a marriage, newborn, or new home.

It is located in the Guilin region on the south-western fringes of the Dushan Mountain (Dú Shān 独山) in the autonomous region Guangxi and is considered to be one of the most important cave sites of the Neolithic in China as it is one of the many independent centers for the introduction of animal domestication and pottery.\n\nThe cave was discovered in 1969 and archaeological excavations began in 1973. Dating revealed that the cave was occupied between 9,000 and 7,500 years ago, the oldest layer reaching as far back as 12,000 years ago. This natural cave was used as a dwelling place, whether it was only a seasonal habitat is not yet clear. The main cave has an area of approximately and faces southwest, adjacent to the Li River with neighboring woods for hunting, lakes for fishing and plains for collecting wild vegetables.\n\nExcavations have so far yielded over 30 human corpses, 110 kinds of mammals, birds, fishes and reptiles, over 1,000 pieces of polished and pierced stone and bone ware, animal teeth, mussel shells and over 10,000 pieces of pottery. A large number of fireplaces and waste pits were also discovered. In the back of the cave stone material is piled up. In older sediments semi-finished stone tools were abundant. Pierced stone tools and polished stone tools were unearthed from more recent layers. Bone artifacts included fishing spears (Yubiao ), arrowheads (zú ) needles (zhēn ) and hairpins (jī ).\n\nThe cave yielded some of the country's oldest pieces of pottery as the appearance of pottery in the area is believed to be related to freshwater snail eating. \"Freshwater snails were one of their staple foods, judging by the quantities of snail shells found in various strata\". The oldest local pottery is according to Chinese archaeologists dated to 12,000 years BP. The ceramics of more recent strata were determined to belong to the \"String pattern-Guan-vessel-type\" ().\nFor some time the cave must also have served as a primitive tomb as bones of about 30 humans were discovered. No burial pits and funeral tools have been found. The bodies were buried mainly in a squatting position.\n\nThe cave was finally abandoned after being inhabited for 5,000 years when a warm and humid period started around 7,000 years ago and the cave, only one meter above the surrounding plain, was often flooded.\n\nThe assertion that the pig was domesticated at this site remains controversial and has not yet been answered conclusively.\n\nscholars Zhang Chia and Hsiao-chun Hung in \"Later hunter-gatherers in southern China, 18 000–3000 BC\":\n\n\"The ‘Neolithic package’ doesn't really work for this fascinating chapter of the human experience, where pottery, social aggregation, animal domestication and rice cultivation all arrive at different places and times. The authors define the role of the ‘pottery-using foragers’, sophisticated hunter-gatherers who left shell or fish middens in caves and dunes. These colonising non-farmers shared numerous cultural attributes with rice cultivators on the Yangtze, their parallel contemporaries over more than 5000 years. Some agriculturalists became hunter-foragers in turn when they expanded onto less fertile soils. No simple linear transition then, but the practice of ingenious strategies, adaptations and links in a big varied land.\"\n\nZengpiyan has been listed a monument of the People's Republic of China in 2001.\n"}
