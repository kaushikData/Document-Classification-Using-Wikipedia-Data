It was the deadliest non-state attack in the history of modern Tunisia, with more fatalities than the 22 killed in the Bardo National Museum attack three months before.\nThe attack received widespread condemnation around the world. The Tunisian government later \"acknowledged fault\" for slow police response to the attack.\n\nIn October 2013, a suicide bomber blew himself up in a botched attack on a Sousse beach while security forces foiled another planned attack nearby.\nThe post-Tunisian revolution led to the 2014 parliamentary election in which the principal secularist party gained a plurality but was unable to govern alone, and ultimately formed a national unity government. Secularist Beji Caid Essebsi was elected president in the Tunisian presidential election, 2014. Since the overthrow of Tunisian president Ben Ali, terrorism increased, leading to 60 victims among security and military troops. Other attacks targeted civilians and tourists. Despite this, Tunisia was considered to be a secure country.\n\nOn 18 March 2015, the Bardo National Museum in Tunis was attacked by three terrorists, leading to the deaths of twenty-two people, including twenty foreigners visiting the museum. Two of the gunmen, Tunisian citizens Yassine Labidi and Saber Khachnaoui, were killed by police, while the third attacker is currently at large. Police treated the event as a terrorist attack. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) claimed responsibility for the attack, and threatened to commit further attacks. However, the Tunisian government blamed a local splinter group of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, called the Okba Ibn Nafaa Brigade, for the attack. A police raid killed nine members on 28 March. After the Bardo attack, the government announced new security measures and declared the country safe again.\n\nOn 26 June 2015 the Spanish-owned five-star Riu Imperial Marhaba Hotel at Port El Kantaoui, a tourist complex situated on the coast about ten kilometres north of Sousse, Tunisia, was hosting 565 guests mainly from Western Europe, 77% of its capacity. Tourists from the hotel as well as from the Soviva Hotel located nearby went to the beach to swim and sunbathe.\n\nAt around noon, Seifeddine Rezgui Yacoubi, disguised as a tourist, socialised with others, and then took out a Kalashnikov assault rifle concealed in a beach umbrella and fired at the tourists on the beach. He entered the hotel, shooting at people he came across. He was killed by security forces during an exchange of fire. All bullets were found to have been fired from the one weapon; the attacker had four magazines of ammunition. The attacker had spoken to his father on a mobile telephone which he then threw into the sea just before the attack; it was retrieved.\n\nAn Interior Ministry spokesman said that they were sure that others helped, but did not participate directly, providing the Kalashnikov, and helping Rezgui to the scene.\n\nThirty-eight people were killed, thirty of whom were British. Among the fatalities was Denis Thwaites, a former professional footballer for Birmingham City, and his wife, Elaine. Thirty-nine others were wounded.\n\nThe killer, Seifiddine Rezgui Yacoubi, also known as \"Abu Yahya al-Qayrawani\", (born 1992 in Gaafour) was a 23-year-old electrical engineering student at University of Kairouan from Gaafour, in northwest Tunisia. He did not have the typical traits of an Islamic extremist: he had a girlfriend, drank alcohol and was a local break-dancing star. He was also believed to be high on cocaine during his rampage. He is believed to have been radicalized over such issues as the Libyan Civil War and Western inaction against the savagery of the Assad government during the Syrian Civil War.\n\nRezgui is thought to have been recruited by Ajnad al-Khilafah, an outgrowth of the Tunisian branch of Ansar al-Sharia, which was founded by Saifallah Ben Hassine, who had lived in the UK in the 1990s and whose mentor during that time was Abu Qatada. High Court papers relating to a control order placed on a British-based suspect state that Ben Hassine \"aimed to recruit new members and send them to Afghanistan for training\". The control order documents add that: \"Abu Qatada appears as a watermark running through the whole of this case as being the mastermind.\"\n\nBen Hassine is reported to have been killed by the USAF near Adjabiya in eastern Libya on 14 June 2015. The strike was designed to kill Mokhtar Belmokhtar in an Ansar meeting. After the overthrow of Tunisia's President Zine el-Abedine Ben Ali in 2011, Ben Hassine was released from jail in March 2011 under an amnesty, and later founded Ansar al-Sharia in Tunisia, which resisted proscription until 2013 arguing it was carrying out humanitarian work, even though Ben Hassine personally had led the storming of the US Embassy in Tunis on 14 September 2012, three days after Ansar's Libyan counterparts killed US ambassador J. Christopher Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. When Ansar was finally outlawed in August 2013, after the murders of two secular leftist MPs, he was listed as a proscribed terrorist by the United States, and he fled to Libya.\n\nQatada wrote in a letter published online in January 2014 that Ben Hassine \"is among the best of those I have known in intellect\" and \"the most knowledgeable of people of my intentions ... for he was the closest of people to me\".\n\nIn January 2017, documents obtained by panorama identified Chamseddine al-Sandi as the mastermind behind the attack. He is named in confessions from suspects who were arrested in connection with the shootings. Rezgui was killed at the scene, but the documents obtained by Panorama say that he was recruited and directed by al-Sandi. The confessions say al-Sandi ran a militant cell responsible for both the Sousse shootings and the attack three months earlier at the Bardo National Museum in which 22 people died. Both attacks were claimed by the Islamic State.\n\nImmediately after the attack, the flight JAF5017, on its way to Enfidha-Hammamet International Airport, was redirected to Brussels. German tour operator TUI offered German tourists the opportunity to fly back to Germany and to cancel or adjust their bookings in Tunisia. British tour operator Thomson announced that flights to Tunisia will be cancelled until at least 9 July 2015, with ten flights departing on the evening of the attacks to bring 2,500 customers in the resort back to the United Kingdom. EasyJet and Thomas Cook announced that customers planning to visit Tunisia would be able to change their travel plans free of charge.\n\nHotels were targeted in attacks to undermine tourism and because they were considered \"brothels\" by ISIS. Both tourism and the related industries accounted for up to 14.9% of the Tunisian economy in 2014.\n\nThe United Kingdom's Home Secretary Theresa May and Foreign Office Minister Tobias Ellwood visited the site of the shooting on 29 June 2015. It was also announced that a Royal Air Force aircraft would be sent in order to repatriate bodies and evacuate the injured back to the United Kingdom. On 29 June an RAF Boeing C-17 Globemaster III flew from RAF Brize Norton to Tunisia to recover four British victims, with the C17 returning via Birmingham Airport to unload one patient, and returning to Brize Norton with the other three.\nOn 29 June, the House of Commons chamber observed a minute of silence shortly before the Prime Minister David Cameron announced that a national minute of silence would be held on 3 July 2015 at 12:00 local time to remember the victims, exactly one week on from the attacks. Cameron later led several COBRA meetings. The Foreign Office sent a team to the hotel to support British survivors and know more about the British victims. The Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner announced an heightened police presence and security for Armed Forces Day and Pride London events taking place in London over the weekend. On 28 June 2015, Her Majesty The Queen said she and the Duke of Edinburgh were shocked by the attack and also offered their deepest sympathy to the injured. Scotland Yard's SO15 Counter Terrorism Command (CTC) launched their largest anti-terrorism investigation since the 7 July 2005 London bombings, involving 600 police officers and support staff. 16 British counter-terrorism police were deployed to Tunisia in the direct aftermath of the attacks, and almost 400 officers were sent to British airports to identify potential witnesses to the attack who had returned home.\n\nOn 1 July, the bodies of eight British nationals who were killed in the attacks were flown from Tunisia to RAF Brize Norton. On 2 July, the bodies of a further nine British nationals who were killed in the attacks were flown to RAF Brize Norton and the Prime Minister David Cameron and Defence Secretary Michael Fallon began making calls for airstrikes in Syria, believing the Sousse attacks to have been coordinated from there. On 3 July, the United Kingdom held a nationwide minute's silence at 12:00 local time to remember the victims of the attacks as government buildings and Buckingham Palace flew the Union Jack at half mast. A further eight bodies of British victims were repatriated back to RAF Brize Norton. On 4 July, the final five bodies of the British victims were repatriated back to the United Kingdom.\n\nAn inquest to the attack was initially scheduled to start in November 2016 but was pushed back to 2017. On 16 January 2017, the first hearing of the inquest was held in the Royal Courts of Justice. The inquest found that the police response to the Tunisia Beach Attacks was \"at best shambolic and at worst cowardly\" after officers in the vicinity were found to be hiding or running in the opposite direction to the attacker. A security team close by to the attack and armed with assault rifles and wearing protective vests, retreated to wait for reinforcements for a half an hour, during which time the lone gunman killed the 38 victims.\n\nBy March 2017, at least six police officers were referred to trial for criminal negligence for failing to help the victims, and 27 others were referred on similar charges, according to the Tunisian Justice Ministry.\n\nA coroner at the inquest ruled that the victims of the attacks were \"unlawfully killed\" prompting the relatives of British victims to take legal action against tour operator TUI.\n\nAllen Pembroke and Paul Short were awarded the Queens Commendation for bravery for their actions in the 2017 Queens Birthday Honours.\n\nTunisian president Beji Caid Essebsi called for a global strategy against terrorism and visited Sousse with Prime Minister Habib Essid, who promised to close 80 mosques within the week. The government also plans to crack down on financing for certain associations as a countermeasure against another attack. Essid announced new anti-terrorism measures, including the deployment of reserve troops to reinforce security at \"sensitive sites ... and places that could be targets of terrorist attacks.\" The \"exceptional plan to better secure tourist and archaeological sites\" will include \"deploying armed tourist security officers all along the coast and inside hotels from 1 July,\" and that:\n\nBeji Caid Essebsi also denounced the \"cowardly\" attacks, promising \"painful but necessary\" measures to fight extremism in the country. He called for a firm response: \"No country is safe from terrorism, and we need a global strategy of all democratic countries,\"\n\nOn 4 July, Essebsi removed from his post the provincial Governor of Sousse and at least five senior police officers. Among the policemen dismissed were three from Sousse, one from Gaafour (the home city of Rezgui) and one from Kairouan, where Rezgui was studying.\n\nOn 22 July, Tunisian MPs began a three-day debate on new counter-terrorism legislation. The legislation would allow the courts to impose death sentences to those convicted of terrorism related offences. The legislation would also make public support of terrorism a jailable offence. If passed, the bill would allow law enforcement and security services to tap phone calls of individuals suspected of terrorism.\n\nOn 8 July, the British Foreign & Commonwealth Office changed the advised status of Tunisia to \"Advise against all but essential travel\", resulting from 9 July in the planned return home of the estimated 3,000 British nationals in Tunisia at that time. ABTA and travel organisations First Choice, TUI and Thomson have stated that they plan to send no further British tourists to Tunisia until after 31 October 2015.\n\nFour other Islamist attacks took place on the same day in France, Kuwait, Syria and Somalia. The attacks followed an audio message released three days earlier by ISIL senior leader Abu Mohammad al-Adnani encouraging militants everywhere to attack during the month of Ramadan. No definitive link between the attacks has yet been established. One attack, at a French factory, resulted in the beheading of one person; another bombing at a Shia mosque in Kuwait City killed at least 27; and the other attack on an African Union base in Somalia undertaken by Al-Shabaab, killed at least 70.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3613142", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3613142", "title": "Agricultural philosophy", "text": "Agricultural philosophy\n\nAgricultural philosophy (or philosophy of agriculture) is, roughly and approximately, a discipline devoted to the systematic critique of the philosophical frameworks (or ethical world views) that are the foundation for decisions regarding agriculture. Many of these views are also used to guide decisions dealing with land use in general. (Please see the Wikipedia article on environmental philosophy.) In everyday usage, it can also be defined as the love of, search after, and wisdom associated with agriculture, as one of humanity's founding components of civilization. However, this view is more aptly known as agrarianism. In actuality, agrarianism is only one philosophy or normative framework out of many that people use to guide their decisions regarding agriculture on an everyday basis. The most prevalent of these philosophies will be briefly defined below.\n\nThis view was first put forth by Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill. Though there are many varieties of utilitarianism, generally the view is that a morally right action is an action that produces the maximum good for people. This theory is a form of consequentialism; which basically means that the correct action is understood entirely in terms of the consequences of that action. Utilitarianism is often used when deciding farming issues. For example, farmland is commonly valued based upon its capacity to the grow crops that people want. This approach to valuing land is called Asset Theory (in contrast to Location Theory) and it is based upon utilitarian principles. Another example is when a community decides on what to do with a particular parcel of land. Let's say that this community must decide to use it for industry, residential uses, or for farming. By using a utilitarian approach, the council would judge which use would benefit the greatest number of people in the community and then make their choice based upon that information. Finally, it also forms the foundation for industrial farming; as an increase in yield, which would increase the number of people able to receive goods from farmed land, is judged from this view to be a good action or approach. Indeed, a common argument in favor of industrial agriculture is this it is a good practice because it increases the benefits for humans; benefits such as food abundance and a drop in food prices.\n\nHowever, several scholars and writers, such as Peter Singer, Aldo Leopold, Vandana Shiva, Barbara Kingsolver, and Wendell Berry have argued against this view. For example, Singer argues that the suffering of animals (farm animals included) should be included in the cost/benefit calculus when deciding whether or not to do an action such as industrial farming. It has also been challenged on the grounds that farmland and farm animals are instrumentalized in this view and not valued in and of themselves. In addition, systems thinkers, deep ecologists, and agrarian philosophers (such as Aldo Leopold & Wendell Berry) critique this view on the grounds that it ignores aspects of farming which are morally applicable and/or intrinsically valuable. The Slow Food Movement and the Buy Local Agricultural Movements are also built upon philosophical views morally opposed to extreme versions of this approach. Other critiques will be explored below when different philosophical approaches to agriculture are briefly explained. However, it is important to note that the Utilitarian approach to agriculture is currently the most widespread approach within the modern Western World.\n\nAnother philosophical approach often used when deciding land or farming issues is Libertarianism. Libertarianism is, roughly, the moral view that agents own themselves and have certain moral rights including the right to acquire property. In a looser sense, Libertarianism is commonly identified with the belief that each person has a right to a maximum amount of liberty when this liberty does not interfere with other people's freedom. A well known Libertarian theorist is John Hospers. Within this view, property rights are natural rights. Thus, it would be acceptable for a farmer to inefficiently farm their land as long as they don't harm others while doing it. In 1968, Garrett Harden applied this philosophy to land/farming issues when he argued that the only solution to the \"Tragedy of the Commons\" was to place soil and water resources into the hands of private citizens. He then supplied utilitarian justifications to support his argument and, indeed, you could argue that Libertarianism is rooted in utilitarian ideals. However, this leaves Libertarian based land ethics open to the above critiques lodged against Utilitarian approaches to agriculture. Even excepting these critiques, the Libertarian view has been specifically challenged by the critique that people making self-interested decisions can cause large ecological and social disasters such as the Dust Bowl disaster. Even so, it is a philosophical view commonly held within the United States and, especially, by U.S. ranchers and farmers.\n\nEgalitarian based views are often developed as a response to Libertarianism. This is because, while Libertarianism provides for the maximum amount of human freedom, it does not require a person to help others. In addition, it also leads to the grossly uneven distribution of wealth. A well known Egalitarian philosopher is John Rawls. When focusing on agriculture, what this translates into is the uneven distribution of land and food. While both Utilitarian and Libertarian approaches to agriculture ethics could conceivably rationalize this mal-distribution, an Egalitarian approach typically favors equality whether that be equal entitlement and/or opportunity to employment or access to food. However, if you recognize that people have a right to something, then someone has to supply this opportunity or item; whether that be an individual person or the government. Thus, the Egalitarian view links land and water with the right to food. With the growth of human populations and the decline of soil and water resources, Egalitarianism could provide a strong argument for the preservation of soil fertility and water.\n\nIn addition to Utilitarian, Libertarian, and Egalitarian philosophies, there are also normative views that are based upon the principle that land has intrinsic value and positions coming out of an ecological or systems view. Two main examples of this are James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis which postulates that the Earth is an organism and deep ecologists who argue that human communities are built upon a foundation of the surrounding ecosystems or the biotic communities. While the above philosophies can be useful for guiding decision making on issues concerning land in general, they have limited usefulness when applied to agriculture because these philosophies privilege natural ecosystems and agricultural ecosystems are often considered not natural. One philosophy grounded in the principle that land has intrinsic value which is directly applicable to agriculture is Aldo Leopold's stewardship ethic or land ethic. For Leopold, an action is correct if it tends to \"preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community\". Similar to Egalitarian-based land ethics, many of the above philosophies were also developed as alternatives to utilitarian and libertarian based approaches. Leopold's ethic is currently one of the most popular ecological approaches to agriculture commonly known as agrarianism. Other agrarianists include Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, J. Hector St. John de Crèvecœur (1735–1813), Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–1882), Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862), John Steinbeck (1902–1968), Wendell Berry (b. 1934), Gene Logsdon (b. 1932), Paul B. Thompson, and Barbara Kingsolver.\n"}

{"id": "1172181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1172181", "title": "American nationalism", "text": "American nationalism\n\nAmerican nationalism or United States nationalism is a form of civic nationalism found in the United States. Essentially, it indicates the aspects that characterize and distinguish the United States as an autonomous political community. The term often serves to explain efforts to reinforce its national identity and self-determination within their national and international affairs. American scholars such as Hans Kohn state that the United States government institutionalized a civic nationalism founded upon legal and rational concepts of citizenship, being based on common language and cultural traditions. The Founding Fathers of the United States established the country upon classical liberal and individualist principles, although forms of ethnic nationalism were sometimes promoted until the civil rights movement.\n\nThe United States traces its origins to the Thirteen Colonies founded by Britain in the 17th and early 18th century. Residents identified with Britain until the mid-18th century when the first sense of being \"American\" emerged. The Albany Plan proposed a union between the colonies in 1754. Although unsuccessful, it served as a reference for future discussions of independence.\n\nSoon afterward, the colonies faced several common grievances over acts passed by the British Parliament, including taxation without representation. Americans were in general agreement that only their own colonial legislatures—and not Parliament in London—could pass taxes. Parliament vigorously insisted otherwise and no compromise was found. The London government punished Boston for the Boston Tea Party and the Thirteen Colonies united and formed the Continental Congress, which lasted from 1774 to 1789. Fighting broke out in 1775 and the sentiment swung to independence in early 1776, influenced especially by the appeal to American nationalism by Thomas Paine. His pamphlet \"Common Sense\" was a runaway best seller in 1776. Congress unanimously issued a Declaration of Independence announcing a new nation had formed, the United States of America. American Patriots won the American Revolutionary War and received generous peace terms from Britain in 1783. The minority of Loyalists (loyal to King George III) could remain or leave, but about 80% remained and became full American citizens. Frequent parades along with new rituals and ceremonies—and a new flag—provided popular occasions for expressing a spirit of American nationalism.\n\nThe new nation operated under the very weak national government set up by the Articles of Confederation and most Americans put loyalty to their state ahead of loyalty to the nation. Nationalists led by George Washington, Alexander Hamilton and James Madison had Congress call a constitutional convention in 1787. It produced the Constitution for a strong national government which was debated in every state and unanimously adopted. It went into effect in 1789 with Washington as the first President.\n\nIn an 1858 speech, future President Abraham Lincoln alluded to a form of American civic nationalism originating from the tenets of the Declaration of Independence as a force for national unity in the United States, stating that it was a method for uniting diverse peoples of different ethnic ancestries into a common nationality:\nWhite Southerners increasingly felt alienated—they saw themselves as becoming second-class citizens as aggressive anti-slavery Northerners tried to end their ability to take slave property to the fast-growing western territories. They questioned whether their loyalty to the nation trumped their loyalty to their state and their way of life since it was so intimately bound up with slavery, whether they owned any slaves or not. A sense of Southern nationalism was starting to emerge, though it was inchoate as late as 1860 when the election of Lincoln was a signal for most of the slave states in the South to secede and form their own new nation. The Confederate government insisted the nationalism was real and imposed increasing burdens on the population in the name of independence and nationalism. The fierce combat record of the Confederates demonstrates their commitment to the death for independence. The government and army refused to compromise and were militarily overwhelmed in 1865. By the 1890s, the white South felt vindicated through its belief in the newly constructed memory of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy. The North came to accept or at least tolerate racial segregation and disfranchisement of black voters in the South. The spirit of American nationalism had returned to Dixie.\n\nThe North's triumph in the American Civil War marked a significant transition in American national identity. The ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment settled the basic question of national identity, such as the criteria for becoming a citizen of the United States. Everyone born in the territorial boundaries of the United States or those areas and subject to its jurisdiction was an American citizen, regardless of ethnicity or social status (Indians on reservations became citizens in 1924 while Indians off reservations had always been citizens).\n\nWith a very fast growing industrial economy, immigrants were welcome from Europe, Canada, Mexico and Cuba and millions came. Becoming a full citizen was an easy process of filling out paperwork over a five-year span.\n\nHowever, new Asian arrivals were not welcome. Restrictions were imposed on most Chinese immigrants in the 1880s and informal restrictions on most Japanese in 1907. By 1924, it was difficult for any Asian to enter the United States, but children born in the United States to Asian parents were full citizens. The restrictions were ended on the Chinese in the 1940s and on other Asians in 1965.\n\nNationalism and Americanism remain topics in the modern United States. Political scientist Paul McCartney, for instance, argues that as a nation defined by a creed and sense of mission Americans tend to equate their interests with those of humanity, which in turn informs their global posture. In certain cases, it may be considered a form of ethnocentrism and American exceptionalism.\n\nDue to the distinctive circumstances involved throughout history in American politics, its nationalism has developed in regards to both loyalty to a set of liberal, universal political ideals and a perceived accountability to propagate those principles globally. Acknowledging the conception of the United States as accountable for spreading liberal change and promoting democracy throughout the world's politics and governance has defined practically all of American foreign policy. Therefore, democracy promotion is not just another measure of foreign policy, but it is rather the fundamental characteristic of their national identity and political determination.\n\nThe September 11 attacks of 2001 led to a wave of nationalist expression in the United States. This was accompanied by a rise in military enlistment that included not only lower-income Americans, but also middle-class and upper-class citizens.\n\nIn their article in the \"American Sociological Review\", \"Varieties of American Popular Nationalism\", sociologists Bart Bonikowski and Paul DiMaggio report on research findings supporting the existence of at least four kinds of American nationalists, including, from smallest to largest groups: (1) the disengaged, (2) creedal or civic nationalists, (3) ardent nationalists, and (4) restrictive nationalists. \n\nBonikowski and Dimaggio's analysis of these four groups found that \"ardent nationalists\" made up about 24% of their study, and was the larger of the two groups they describe as \"extreme\". Members of this group identified closely with the United States, were very proud of their country, and associated themselves strongly with factors of national hubris. However, although they felt that it was important that a \"true American\" speak English, and had lived most of their life in the U.S., they rejected the necessity of being Christian or being born in the country. Nevertheless, ardent nationalists perceived Jews, Muslims, agnostics and naturalized citizens as something less than truly American. The second class that Bonikowski and DiMaggio referred to as \"extreme\" was the smallest of the four classes, making up 17% of their respondents. \"The disengaged\" showed low levels of pride in the institutions of government and did not fully identify themselves with the United States. Their lack of pride extended to American democracy, American history, the political equality in the U.S., and the country's political influence in the world. This group was the least nationalistic of all four groups identified.\n\nThe two remaining classes were less homogeneous in their responses than were ardent nationalists and the disengaged. \"Restrictive nationalists\" had low levels of pride in American and its institutions, but defined a \"true American\" in ways that were markedly \"exclusionary\". This group was the largest of the four, including 38% of the study's respondents. While their levels of national identification and pride were moderate, they espoused beliefs that restricted who they considered to be \"true Americans\", excluding, for instance, non-Christians. The final group identified were \"creedal nationalists\", who made of 22% of the study. This group believes in liberal values, is proud of the United States, and held the fewest restrictions on who could be considered to be a true American. They identified closely with their country, which they felt \"very close\" to, and were proud if its achievements. Bonikowski and Dimaggio dubbed the group \"creedal\" because their beliefs most closely approximated the precepts of what is widely taken to be the American creed.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been described as a nationalist and has embraced the term himself. Several current and former officials within his administration, including former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon, Senior Advisor to the President Stephen Miller, Director of the National Trade Council Peter Navarro, former Deputy Assistant to the President Sebastian Gorka, Special Assistant to the President Julia Hahn, former Deputy Assistant to the President for Strategic Communications Michael Anton, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, National Security Advisor John R. Bolton and former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn have been described as representing a \"nationalist wing\" within the federal government.\n\nIn a February 2017 article in \"The Atlantic\", journalist Uri Friedman described \"populist economic nationalist\" as a new nationalist movement \"modeled on the 'populism' of the 19th-century U.S. President Andrew Jackson\" which was introduced in Trump's remarks to the Republican National Convention in a speech written by Stephen Miller and Steve Bannon. Miller had adopted Sessions' form of \"nation-state populism\" while working as his aid. By September 2017, \"The Washington Post\" journalist Greg Sargent observed that \"Trump's nationalism\" as \"defined\" by Bannon, Breitbart, Miller and \"the rest of the 'populist economic nationalist' contingent around Trump\", was beginning to have wavering support among Trump voters.

Frye consciously omits all specific and practical criticism, instead offering classically inspired theories of modes, symbols, myths and genres, in what he termed \"an interconnected group of suggestions.\" The literary approach proposed by Frye in \"Anatomy\" was highly influential in the decades before deconstructivist criticism and other expressions of postmodernism came to prominence in American academia circa 1980s.\n\nFrye's four essays are sandwiched between a \"Polemical Introduction\" and a \"Tentative Conclusion.\" The four essays are titled \"Historical Criticism: A Theory of Modes\", \"Ethical Criticism: a Theory of Symbols\", \"Archetypal Criticism: A Theory of Myths\", and \"Rhetorical Criticism: A Theory of Genres.\"\n\nThe purpose of the introduction is to defend the need for literary criticism, to distinguish the nature of genuine literary criticism from other forms of criticism, and to clarify the difference between direct experience of literature and the systematic study of literary criticism.\n\nThere are a number of reasons why the introduction is labeled as a 'polemic'. In defending the need for literary criticism, Frye opposes a notion common to Tolstoy and Romantic thought that 'natural taste' is superior to scholarly learning (and by extension, criticism). Frye also accuses a number of methods of criticism (e.g. Marxist, Freudian, Jungian, Neo-classical, etc.) as being embodiments of the deterministic fallacy. He is not opposed to these ideologies in particular, but sees the application of any external, ready-made ideology to literature as a departure from genuine criticism. This results in subjecting a work of literature to an individual's pet philosophy and an elevation or demotion of authors according to their conformity to the pet philosophy.\n\nAnother point is to distinguish the difference between personal taste and genuine criticism. Personal taste is too easily swayed by the prevailing morals, values and tastes of the critic's society at that point in history. If taste succumbs entirely to such social forces, the result is the same as that of consciously adopting an external ideology described above. Yet even if there is a consensus among critics that the works of John Milton are more fruitful than R. D. Blackmore (to use Frye's example), a critic contributes little by saying so. In other words, value judgments contribute little to meaningful criticism.\n\nIn place of meaningless criticism, Frye proposes a genuine literary criticism which draws its method from the body of literature itself. Literary criticism ought to be a systematic study of works of literature, just as physics is of nature and history is of human action. Frye makes the explicit assumption that in order for systematic study to be possible, the body of literature must already possess a systematic nature. Frye claims that we know very little about this system as yet and that the systematic study of literature has progressed little since Aristotle.\n\nFrye concludes his introduction by addressing the weaknesses of his argument. He mentions that the introduction is a polemic, but written in first person to acknowledge the individual nature of his views. He concedes that the following essays can only give a preliminary, and likely inexact, glimpse of the system of literature. He admits to making sweeping generalities that will often prove false in light of particular examples. Finally, he stresses that while many feel an \"emotional repugnance\" to schematization of poetry, the schematization should be regarded as an aspect of criticism, not the vibrant, personal, direct experience of the work itself—much as the geologist turns away from his or her systematic work to enjoy the beauty of the mountains.\n\nFrye's systemization of literature begins with three aspects of poetry given by Aristotle in his \"Poetics\": \"mythos\" (plot), \"ethos\" (characterization/setting), and \"dianoia\" (theme/idea). Frye sees works of literature as lying somewhere on a continuum between being plot driven, as in most fiction, and idea driven, as in essays and lyrical poetry. The First essay begins by exploring the different aspects of fiction (subdivided into tragic and comic) in each mode and ends with a similar discussion of thematic literature.\n\nFrye divides his study of tragic, comic, and thematic literature into five \"modes\", each identified with a specific literary epoch: mythic, romantic, high mimetic, low mimetic, and ironic. This categorization is a representation of \"ethos\", or characterization and relates to how the protagonist is portrayed in respect to the rest of humanity and the protagonist's environment. Frye suggests that Classical civilizations progressed historically through the development of these modes, and that something similar happened in Western civilization during medieval and modern times. He speculates that contemporary fiction may be undergoing a return to myth, completing a full circle through the five modes. Frye argues that when irony is pushed to extremes, it returns to the mode of myth; this concept of the \"recursion\" of historical cycles is familiar from Giambattista Vico and Oswald Spengler.\n\nTragedy is concerned with the hero's separation from society.\n\nComedy is concerned with integration of society.\n\nFinally, Frye explores the nature of thematic literature in each mode. Here, the intellectual content is more important than the plot, so these modes are organized by what is considered more authoritative or educational at the time. Also, these modes tend to organize by societal structure.\n\nNow that Frye has established his theory of modes, he proposes five levels, or \"phases\", of symbolism, each phase independently possessing its own \"mythos\", ethos, and \"dianoia\" as laid out in the first essay. These phases are based on the four levels of medieval allegory (the first two phases constituting the first level). Also, Frye relates the five phases with the ages of man laid out in the first essay. Frye defines a literary symbol as: \"[A]ny unit of any literary structure that can be isolated for critical attention.\"\n\nSymbolic phases:\n\nThe descriptive phase exhibits the centrifugal, or outward, property of a symbol. For example, when a word such as 'cat' evokes a definition, image, experience or any property connected with the word 'cat' external to the literary context of the particular usage, we have the word taken in the descriptive sense. Frye labels any such symbol a \"sign\". He does not define the sign beyond this sense of pointing to the external, nor does he refer to any particular semiotic theory. In opposition to the sign stands the \"motif\" which is a symbol taken in the literal phase. This phase demonstrates the inward, or centripetal, direction of meaning, best described as the contextual meaning of the symbol. To Frye, \"literal\" means nearly the opposite of its usage in common speech; to say that something \"literally\" means something generally involves referring to a definition external to the text. Instead, \"literal\" refers to the symbol's meaning in its specific literary situation while \"descriptive\" refers to personal connotation and conventional definition. Finally, Frye draws an analogy between rhythm and harmony with the literal and descriptive phases respectively. The literal phase tends to be horizontal, dependent on what comes before and after the symbol while the descriptive phase tends to be laid out in space, having external meanings that vary in nearness to the contextual meaning.\n\nFrye next introduces the formal phase, embodied by the image, in order to define the layer of meaning that results from the interplay of the harmony and rhythm of the signs and motifs. The most frequently repeated imagery sets the tone of the work (as with the color red in \"Macbeth\"), with less repeated imagery working in contrast with this tonal background. This section of the essay gives a faithful representation of literary formalism (also known as New Criticism). Frye's representation of formalism here is unique; however, its setting as part of the larger system of literary criticism Frye outlines in the entire work. The notion of form (and perhaps Frye's literal phase) relies heavily on the assumption of inherent meaning within the text—a point contested by deconstructionist critics.\n\nThe mythical phase is the treatment of a symbol as an archetype. This concept relates most closely with intertextuality and considers the symbol in a work as interconnected with similar symbolism throughout the entire body of literature. While Frye deals with myths and archetypes from a broader perspective in the third essay, in this section he focuses on the critical method of tracing a symbol's heritage through literary works both prior and subsequent to the work in question. Frye argues that convention is a vital part of literature and that copyright is deleterious to the process of literary creation. Frye points to the use of convention in Shakespeare and Milton as examples to strengthen his argument that even verbatim copying of text and plot does not entail a death of creativity. Further, Frye argues that romantic, anti-conventional writers such as Walt Whitman tend to follow convention anyway. In criticism, the study of the archetypal phase of a symbol is akin to the \"nature\" perspective in the psychological debate over nature versus nurture. Rather than viewing the symbol as a unique achievement of the author or some inherent quality of the text, the archetypeal phase situates the symbol in its society of literary kindred as a product of its conventional forebears.\n\nFinally, Frye proposes an anagogic phase wherein a symbol is treated as a monad. The anagogic level of medieval allegory treated a text as expressing the highest spiritual meaning. For example, Dante's Beatrice in the Divine Comedy would represent the bride of Christ. Frye makes the argument that not only is there a lateral connection of archetypes through intertextuality, but that there is a transcendent almost spiritual unity within the body of literature. Frye describes the anagogic in literature as \"the imitation of infinite social action and infinite human thought, the mind of a man who is all men, the universal creative word which is all words.\"\n\nFrye begins the essay regarding myth as the source of all literature (as a visual, auditory and textual art form), paintings (as visual art form) and music (as an auditory art form). The underlying structures and patterns of all these forms are similar, though they have a unique style of their own. \n\nThe third essay is the culmination of Frye's theory in that it unites the elements of characterization and each of the five symbolic phases presented in the first two essays into an organic whole. This whole is organized around a metaphor of human desire and frustration as manifested in the Great Chain of Being (divine, human, animal, vegetable, mineral and water) by analogy to the four seasons.\n\nAt one pole we have apocalyptic imagery which typifies the revelation of heaven and ultimate fulfillment of human desire. In this state, the literary structure points toward unification of all things in a single analogical symbol. The ultimate of the divine is the deity, of the human is Christ (or any other being that embodies the oneness of humanity in its spiritual culmination), of the animal is the lamb, of the vegetable is the Tree of Life or vine, and of the mineral is the heavenly Jerusalem or city of God.\n\nAt the opposite pole lies demonic imagery which typifies the unfulfillment, perverion, or opposition of human desire. In this state, things tend toward anarchy or tyranny. The divine is an angry, inscrutable God demanding sacrifice, the human is the tyrannical anti-Christ, the animal is a predator such as a lion, the vegetable is the evil wood as found at the beginning of Dante's \"Inferno\" or Hawthorne's \"Young Goodman Brown\", and the city is the dystopia embodied by Orwell's \"1984\" or Kafka's \"The Castle\".\n\nFinally we have the analogical imagery, or more simply, depictions of states that are similar to paradise or hell, but not identical. There is a great deal of variety in the imagery of these structures, but tame animals and wise rulers are common in structures analogical to the apocalyptic (analogy of innocence), while predatory aristocrats and masses living in squalor characterize analogy to the demonic (analogy of experience).\n\nFrye then identifies the mythical mode with the apocalyptic, the ironic with the demonic, and the romantic and low mimetic with their respective analogies. The high mimetic, then, occupies the center of all four. This ordering allows Frye to place the modes in a circular structure and point to the cyclical nature of myth and archetypes. In this setting, literature represents the natural cycle of birth, growth, maturity, decline, death, resurrection, rebirth, and the repetition of the cycle. The remainder of the chapter deals with the cycle of the four seasons as embodied by four mythoi: comedy, romance, tragedy, and irony or satire.\n\nIn the first three essays, Frye deals mainly with the first three elements of Aristotle's elements of poetry (i.e. mythos, ethos, dianoia). In the fourth essay, he explores the last three elements:\n\nWhereas mythos is the verbal imitation of action and dianoia the verbal imitation of thought (ethos being composed of the two), melos and opsis (with lexis composed of the two) correspond, though seen from a different (rhetorical) perspective. Frye identifies the connection as such: \"The world of social action and event . . . has a particularly strong association with the ear. . . . The world of individual thought and idea has a correspondingly close connection with the eye . . .\" (Frye, 243).\n\nRhetoric means two things: ornamental (opsis) speech and persuasive (melos) speech. Rhetorical criticism, then, is the exploration of literature in the light of melos, opsis, and their interplay as manifested in lexis.\n\nThe \"radical of presentation\"—the relation (or idealized relation) between author and audience—is a further consideration. Difference in genre relies not on topical considerations (science fiction, romance, mystery), nor in length (e.g. epics are long, lyrics are short), but in the radical of presentation. As such, Frye proposes a total of four distinct genres:\n\nThese four genres form the organizing principle of the essay, first examining the distinctive kind of rhythm of each, then looking at specific forms of each more closely. As Frye describes each genre, he explains the function of melos and opsis in each. To understand Frye's melos, it is important to note his counter-intuitive usage of the term \"musical\". He contends that the common usage of the term is inaccurate for purposes of criticism, drawn from analogy with harmony, a stable relationship. Music, however, does not consist of a plastic, static, continuously stable relationship, but rather a series of dissonances resolving at the end into a stable relationship. Poetry containing little dissonance, then, has more in common with the plastic arts than with music.\n\nThe original presentation of the epic was \"ta epe\" (that which is spoken), and when an author, speaker, or storyteller addresses a visible audience directly, we have epos. The rhythm of epos is that of recurrence (i.e. accent, meter, sound patterns). These are the rhythms most commonly associated with poetry.\n\n\"Fiction\" is a vague term which Frye uses to avoid introducing too many new terms. Part of the difficulty comes from fact that this is the only of the four genres which has no precedent in antiquity. He acknowledges having used the term previously in a different sense. In this essay, the term refers to literature in which the author addresses the audience through a book, or more simply stated, prose. The rhythm of prose is that of continuity of meaning.\n\nDrama lies halfway between epos and fiction, or more accurately, its diction must fit the setting and the character. Some characters may be melos-oriented, speaking in meter or with various rhetorical effects in song and banter. Others may be opsis-oriented, speaking more in prose and conveying ideological content. Most characters alternate according to the dramatic situation. Such a marriage of the appropriate language with the character and setting (ethos) defines a rhythm of decorum, the distinctive rhythm of drama.\n\nClassical lyrical poetry often presents a shepherd speaking of his love; he is overheard by his audience. However, the distinctiveness of lyric comes more from its peculiar rhythm than from this radical of representation. Frye describes this rhythm as associative rather than logical and is the stuff of dreams and the subconscious. It is closely related to the chant, and though it is found in all literature, it is more apparent in certain kinds of literature than others. At this point Frye suggests a connection between the four historical modes and the four genres. In this sense, the lyrical is typical of the ironic age—just as the ironic protagonist has turned away from society, the lyrical poet makes utterances without regard to the audience. The lyrical rhythm is very clearly seen in Joyce's \"Finnegans Wake\", a work based almost entirely on associative babbles and dream utterance.\n\n\n\n"}

It is a developmental process that comes about through socially formulated, goal-directed, and tool-mediated actions. Appropriation draws on the developmental theories of Piaget and Vygotsky, as both the cognitive and social-constructivist views of learning are equally emphasized. Henry Jenkins, discusses appropriation as \"the ability to meaningfully sample and remix the content(s)\" of our culture for new expressive purposes. Jenkins noted that many literature classes in schools are embracing appropriation. A common example of appropriation at its finest is Ricardo Pitts-Wiley's \"Moby-Dick: Then and Now\", a contemporary reworking of Herman Melville's Moby-Dick narrative. Fundamental to appropriation is the idea that knowledge is socially constructed and that the student plays an active role in its construction. Appropriation has occurred when the student has adapted the information in a way that is meaningful to them and they can use the knowledge as their own.\n\nAppropriation in education is often understood and analyzed through activity theory. This theory was developed by Aleksei N. Leontiev and focuses on understanding the socio-cultural context (specifically the setting) learning occurs in. Activity theory is predicated on the assumption that a person's frameworks for thinking are developed and carried out in specific settings, and that these settings mediate cognitive development. Since appropriation also places a strong emphasis on setting, these theories complement each other when being used to analyze learning environments.\n\nHung has developed steps through which the appropriation of knowledge usually occurs. The process is as follows:\n\n\nThrough research with English teachers, Grossman \"et al.\" developed a theory to describe the varying levels of appropriation. The degrees \n\nThere are a variety of factors that can affect the level of appropriation that the student achieves. Some of these factors are:\n\n\nThrough appropriation students construct their own versions of knowledge, allowing internalization of the information they have learned. Their beliefs and behaviours concerning the concepts learned also change. These transformations alter the student’s conception of the information, which will affect how that information is given to others interacting with the student. How knowledge is transferred from one person to the next is an important aspect of appropriation and demonstrates the collaborative aspect of appropriation, where knowledge is constantly being negotiated with other. Collaboratively, students and teachers construct knowledge in a way that is meaningful to them.\n\n"}

As with the latter two he was part of the Airgíalla tradition of poetry and song.\n\nIt is commonly believed that Mac Cumhaigh was born in Creggan, County Armagh, where a branch of the Uí Néill had been the traditional patrons of the poets under the old order. However, the most comprehensive research into Mac Cumhaigh's life and works could only suggest a birthplace on or near the Louth/Armagh border in or near the parish of Creggan. Mac Cumhaigh eked out a living as a \"spailpín\", or travelling labourer.

{"id": "4763", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4763", "title": "Baroque dance", "text": "Baroque dance\n\nBaroque dance is dance of the Baroque era (roughly 1600–1750), closely linked with Baroque music, theatre and opera.\n\nThe majority of surviving choreographies from the period are English country dances, such as those in the many editions of Playford's \"The Dancing Master\". Playford only gives the floor patterns of the dances, with no indication of the steps. However, other sources of the period, such as the writings of the French dancing-masters Feuillet and Lorin, indicate that steps more complicated than simple walking were used at least some of the time.\n\nEnglish country dance survived well beyond the Baroque era and eventually spread in various forms across Europe and its colonies, and to all levels of society.\n\nThe great innovations in dance in the 17th century originated at the French court under Louis XIV, and it is here that we see the first clear stylistic ancestor of classical ballet. The same basic technique was used both at social events, and as theatrical dance in court ballets and at public theaters. The style of dance is commonly known to modern scholars as the \"French noble style\" or \"belle danse\" (French, literally \"beautiful dance\"), however it is often referred to casually as \"baroque dance\" in spite of the existence of other theatrical and social dance styles during the baroque era.\n\nPrimary sources include more than three hundred choreographies in Beauchamp-Feuillet notation, as well as manuals by Raoul Handsome Auger Feuillet and Pierre Rameau in France, Kellom Tomlinson and John Weaver in England, and Gottfried Taubert in Germany. This wealth of evidence has allowed modern scholars and dancers to recreate the style, although areas of controversy still exist. The standard modern introduction is Hilton.\n\nFrench dance types include:\n\nThe English, working in the French style, added their own hornpipe to this list.\n\nMany of these dance types are familiar from baroque music, perhaps most spectacularly in the stylized suites of J. S. Bach. Note, however, that the allemandes, that occur in these suites do not correspond to a French dance from the same period.\n\nThe French noble style was danced both at social events and by professional dancers in theatrical productions such as opera-ballets and court entertainments. However, 18th-century theatrical dance had at least two other styles: comic or grotesque, and semi-serious.\n\nOther dance styles, such as the Italian and Spanish dances of the period are much less well studied than either English country dance or the French style. The general picture seems to be that during most of the 17th century, a style of late Renaissance dance was widespread, but as time progressed, French ballroom dances such as the minuet were widely adopted at fashionable courts. Beyond this, the evolution and cross-fertilisation of dance styles is an area of ongoing research.\n\nThe revival of baroque music in the 1960s and '70s sparked renewed interest in 17th and 18th century dance styles. While some 300 of these dances had been preserved in Beauchamp-Feuillet notation, it wasn't until the mid-20th century that serious scholarship commenced in deciphering the notation and reconstructing the dances.\n\nPerhaps best known among these pioneers was Britain's Melusine Wood, who published several books on historical dancing in the 1950s. Wood passed her research on to her student Belinda Quirey, and also to Pavlova Company ballerina and choreographer Mary Skeaping (1902–1984). The latter became well known for her reconstructions of baroque ballets for London's \"Ballet for All\" company in the 1960s.\n\nThe leading figures of the second generation of historical dance research include Shirley Wynne and her Baroque Dance Ensemble which was founded at Ohio State University in the early 1970s and Wendy Hilton (1931–2002), a student of Belinda Quirey who supplemented the work of Melusine Wood with her own research into original sources.\nA native of Britain, Hilton arrived in the U.S. in 1969 joining the faculty of the Juilliard School in 1972 and establishing her own baroque dance workshop at Stanford University in 1974 which endured for more than 25 years.\n\nCatherine Turocy (b. circa 1950) began her studies in Baroque dance in 1971 as a student of dance historian Shirley Wynne. She founded The New York Baroque Dance Company in 1976 with Ann Jacoby, and the company has since toured internationally. In 1982/83 as part of the French national celebration of Jean Philippe Rameau's 300th birthday, Turocy choreographed the first production of Jean-Philippe Rameau's \"Les Boréades\" - it was never performed during the composer's lifetime. This French supported production with John Eliot Gardiner, conductor, and his orchestra was directed by Jean Louis Martinoty. Turocy has been decorated as Chevalier in the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government.\n\nIn 1973, French dance historian Francine Lancelot (1929–2003) began her formal studies in ethnomusicology which later led her to research French traditional dance forms and eventually Renaissance and Baroque dances. In 1980, at the invitation of the French Minister of Culture, she founded the baroque dance company \"Ris et Danceries\". Her work in choreographing the landmark 1986 production of Lully's 1676 tragedie-lyrique \"Atys\" was part of the national celebration of the 300th anniversary of Lully's death. This production propelled the career of William Christie and his ensemble Les Arts Florissants. Since the Ris et Danseries company was disbanded circa 1993, choreographers from the company have continued with their own work. Béatrice Massin with her \"Compagnie Fetes Galantes\", along with Marie Genevieve Massé and her company \"L'Eventail\" are among the most prominent. In 1995 Francine Lancelot's catalogue raisonné of baroque dance, entitled \"La Belle Dance\", was published.\n\n"}

Some of these features are shared with other varieties of Southeast Asian English; but others make Brunei English a distinct variety.\n\nBrunei was a British Protectorate from 1888 until 1984. Not surprisingly, English became widely used, even though Brunei Malay (a dialect of Malay that is substantially different from Standard Malay) continues to be the main language that is spoken.\n\nIn 1985, the Bilingual Education Policy was implemented, with Malay as the medium of instruction for the first three years of primary school, and then English becoming the medium of instruction for most subjects from the fourth year of primary school on. In 1993, history switched from being English medium to being Malay medium.\n\nIn January 2009, a new education policy was implemented. It is termed SPN21 (\"Sistem Pendidikan Negara – Abad 21\", 'National Education System for the 21st Century'). In this new system, Mathematics and Science are taught in English from the start of primary school. Only time will tell what effect this new SPN21 education policy will have on the status of English in Brunei.\n\nClearly, English is well established in Brunei, though it does not seem to be challenging the position of Malay. Rather more threatened are the minority languages such as Dusun, Tutong and Murut (Lun Bawang), which seem to be getting squeezed out by the two dominant languages, though recent research in Temburong District suggests that Murut is surviving better than the other two.\n\nThere is, of course, substantial variation in the English spoken in Brunei. Two sources of variation are mentioned here: education and ethnicity.\n\nThere is rather a wide educational divide. Those who attend private schools and the best government schools usually achieve an excellent standard in English; but those who go to less fashionable schools often end up with only rudimentary skills in English.\n\nThere is also some variation in Brunei English arising from the ethnicity of speakers. Recent research has shown that undergraduates at the University of Brunei Darussalam (UBD) can identify whether a fellow undergraduate is Malay or Chinese on the basis of 10 seconds of spoken English with an accuracy of about 74%, which suggests that the English pronunciation of the two ethnic groups differs to some extent.\n\nSome of the salient features of the pronunciation of English in Brunei are:\n\nOne current change that seems to be taking place is that Brunei English is becoming rhotic, partly influenced by American English and also by the rhoticity of the Malay spoken in Brunei, although English in neighboring Malaysia and Singapore remains mostly non-rhotic.\n\nA few of the salient features of Brunei English grammar are:\n\nThere is widespread borrowing of words from Malay into Brunei English. These include \"titah\" (a speech by the Sultan), \"sabda\" (a speech by another member of the Royal Family), \"tudung\" (a head-dress worn by women) and \"puasa\" ('fasting'). Words for local food are often borrowed from Malay, such as \"kuih\" ('a local cake'), as in 'A variety of Malay kuih and sliced fruits will also be served'.\n\nUse of Malay terms in the English spoken in Brunei can sometimes lead to loss of intelligibility, such as \"Ugama Schools\" ('religious schools') being misunderstood as 'government schools' by someone from the Maldives.\n\nMany initialisms are found, including:\n\nAcronyms (where the letters create a word) are not so common, but we find:\n\nThere are some idiosyncratic expressions in Brunei English, such as \"dry season\" to refer to the period just before payday when people are short of money, as in 'I cannot pay now: dry season bah!'\n\nMixing of English and Malay is extremely widespread in informal discourse in Brunei. In fact, an investigation of the language used in an English-medium discussion forum showed that nearly half of all postings were partly or completely in Malay. In data involving a map task, where one participant has to guide a second participant along a route, a speaker said:\n\nuh so \"jalan saja\" uh continue \"macam ada\" a bit cornering\n\nwith four words of Malay in the English utterance: \"jalan\" (walk), \"saja\" (just), \"macam\" (like) and \"ada\" (there is). So this utterance means: 'just go and continue, like there's a bit of cornering'.\n\nIt is hard to know whether English in Brunei is following an established pattern and emerging as a distinct variety of English or not. Many of the trends found, including the use of plural nouns such as \"equipments\" and the variable use of the 3rd person singular −s suffix on verbs, seem to be similar to the ways English is used as a lingua franca around the world. Furthermore, the avoidance of vowel reduction in unstressed syllables is consistent with the way English is spoken elsewhere in South-East Asia. So Brunei English may be contributing to the ways that English is evolving around the world today.\n"}

These writers in Classical Chinese were trained by memorizing extensive tracts in the classics and histories. Their method of constructing their own work was to extensively cut and paste passages and fragments from these sources. Today this would be called plagiarism. However, these early Chinese writers considered themselves not as creators, but as preservers of the record. The continuing controversy over the meaning of Chinese text is best understood by examining the classical scholar's way of writing. Zhu Xi was a great editor and commentator but his prime aim was moral learning, considered far more important than art or literature. Zhu Xi cemented Confucian moral righteousness into the Chinese methods of evaluation. Joseph Needham has said, Chinese writers made careful note of observable concrete phenomena but they made little use of categorical analysis or the building of logical systems.\n"}

The center focuses on researching and addressing global water-related challenges, including water scarcity, access, quality and climate risks.\n\nThe Center's stated mission is to \"creatively tackle water challenges of a rapidly changing world where water and climate interact with food, energy, ecosystems and urbanization,\" by combining \"the rigor of scientific research with the impact of effective policy.\" \n\nThe Columbia Water Center takes a multidisciplinary approach to water challenges, employing hydrologists, climatologists, environmental engineers, and water policy analysts. The Director of the center is Upmanu Lall, the Carol Silberstein Professor of Earth and Environmental Engineering and Civil Engineering and Engineering Mechanics at Columbia University.\n\nPierre Gentine, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Engineering, also takes a leading role in the center, with his own PhD and Post-doctoral team focusing on the interactions between soil and atmospheric moisture.\n\nThe center currently divides its projects into five themes, America's Water, The Global Floods Initiative, Data Analytics and Multi-Scale Predictions, Risk and Financial Instruments and the Water, Food, Energy Nexus.\n\nThe Earth Institute, under the leadership of Jeff Sachs, is a research institution that supports sustainable development from various angles.\n\nIn 2008, the PepsiCo Foundation awarded the Earth Institute $6 million to address these water-related issues. The PepsiCo grant led to the establishment of the Columbia Water Center under the leadership of Columbia University engineering professor Upmanu Lall. This three-year grant made possible projects in four countries: India, China, Mali, and Brazil.\n\nIn Brazil, CWC has partnered with the Federal University of Ceará in the northeast to focus on sophisticated climate-based forecasting systems used for water allocation decisions across diverse use sectors. In addition, the CWC team recently completed a municipal water plan (PAM) for Milhã, a rural area in central Ceará. The project outlines a plan for the municipality to deliver water to all of its 14,000 residents.\n\nAs part of the project, the CWC designed and built water infrastructure demonstration projects for Ingá and Pedra Fina, two communities in Milhã. The project provides water to 500 people in the area.\n\nIn India, the project focuses on reducing water consumption in the agricultural sector by encouraging sustainable crop choice patterns, as well as working with corporations to deploy better irrigation technologies (and increase reliability) throughout their supply chains. A key objective is to reduce the groundwater stress in the region. Primary project locations are in the states of Punjab and Gujarat.\n\nIn Punjab, the CWC has partnered with Punjab Agricultural University to come up with innovative solutions to reduce farmer irrigation. Some of the methods developed (including the use of inexpensive tensiometers to measure soil moisture and direct seeding of rice) were field tested in the 2010 planting season with over 500 farmers participating. The Punjab Agricultural University team reports that participating farmers saved 25 to 30 percent of their normal water use by implementing the new approaches. The CWC/PAU team plans to scale up the pilot project in 2011 by recruiting 5,000 rice farmers to use tensiometers.\n\nIn Gujarat, the Columbia Water Center is working with the state government to reform electricity subsidies to provide a greater incentive for farmers to conserve water. In conjunction with subsidy reform, the CWC is also piloting water saving technologies among farmers.\n\nThe work in Mali coincides with the Millennium Villages Project. CWC is focusing on designing irrigation and cropping systems that can be operated and maintained locally in order to provide farmers with higher-value cash crops. The center has installed large pumps that improved the amount of water available. Projects emphasize bringing together local partners, market forces and public-private partnerships.\n\nIn recent years, the Columbia Water Center has expanded the scope of its initiatives to encompass five broad research themes.\n\nThe America’s Water Initiative is aims to build a network of academic institutions, government agencies, and private industry to inform water infrastructure improvements in the United States and address other water challenges. The initiative focuses on all aspects of water, from policy to drought and flood forecasting and the potential for disruptive water technology to provide distributed water infrastructure that is less expensive than replacing legacy systems.\n\nOn March 12, 2015, the initiative held its first annual symposium, which brought together water experts from various groups, representing the industry, utilities, policy and non-profit sectors among others. The meeting was intended to be a first step toward a broader working relationship that can help set a water research agenda and develop solutions for national water challenges.\n\nThe Global Floods Initiative aims to apply cutting-edge and continually evolving climate forecasting techniques to help helping policymakers, disaster relief agencies, infrastructure designers, financial institutions and others better prepare for, manage and respond to extreme floods.\n\nThe initiative builds on almost two decades of research on how the quasi-periodic climate cycles (such as El-Nino/La-Nina and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) interact to increase the risk of flooding in particular locations. More recent research into hydrometerology, which looks at the interaction of land, water and atmosphere at a more local scale, adds additional layers to the potential for flood prediction.\n\nThe Columbia Water Center is a leader in predicting seasonal hydroclimate forecasts and associated risk analyses. These forecasts are used for a variety of applications, including integrating climate forecasts into water allocation procedures for urban, industrial and agricultural consumers.\n\nNew ways of representing convection and vegetation response to water stress are also major areas of research, the results of which could offer new understandings of the carbon and hydrological cycle.\n\nClimate forecasting can also be used to develop flood and drought risk metrics for companies with global supply chains. These metrics can help companies address challenges through new sourcing strategies, novel regional financial risk management products (e.g., cat bonds, index insurance), pre-emptive maintenance and mitigation, reservoir reallocation agreements and other tools.\n\nThe Columbia Water Center studies how the water, food, and energy sectors are interrelated and how climate affects this relationship. Projects include policy research and recommendations to promote water and energy savings in the agricultural sector in water-stressed farming regions, development of seasonal forecasts to guide decision-making in the water and energy sectors, and testing and implementation of low-cost soil moisture and nitrogen sensors to improve irrigation efficiency, reducing fertilizer use and groundwater pollution and saving energy from groundwater pumping.\n\nPartnership Institutions\n"}

Contrafact can also be explained as the use of borrowed chord progressions.\n\nAs a compositional device, it was of particular importance in the 1940s development of bop, since it allowed jazz musicians to create new pieces for performance and recording on which they could immediately improvise, without having to seek permission or pay publisher fees for copyrighted materials (while melodies can be copyrighted, the underlying harmonic structure cannot be).\n\nContrafacts are not to be confused with musical quotations, which comprise borrowing rhythms or melodic figures from an existing composition.\n\nIn classical music, contrafacts have been used as early as the parody mass and In Nomine of the 16th century. More recently, \"Cheap Imitation\" (1969) by John Cage was produced by systematically changing notes from the melody line of \"Socrate\" by Erik Satie using chance procedures.\n\nIn spite of its usefulness, the term \"contrafact\" has not won wide acceptance in Western classical theory.\n\nWell-known examples of contrafacts include the Charlie Parker/Miles Davis bop tune \"Donna Lee,\" which uses the chord changes of the standard \"Back Home Again in Indiana\" or Thelonious Monk's jazz standard \"Evidence\", which borrows the chord progression from Jesse Greer and Raymond Klages's song \"Just You, Just Me\" (1929). The Gershwin tune \"I Got Rhythm\" has proved especially amenable to contrafactual recomposition: the popularity of its \"rhythm changes\" is second only to that of the 12-bar blues as a basic harmonic structure used by jazz composers.\n\n\n\n"}

They were invented in 1795 by Nicolas-Jacques Conté, who created the combination of clay and graphite in response to the shortage of graphite caused by the Napoleonic Wars (the British naval blockade of France prevented import). Conté crayons had the advantage of being cost-effective to produce, and easy to manufacture in controlled grades of hardness.\n\nThey are now manufactured using natural pigments (iron oxides, carbon black, titanium dioxide), clay (kaolin), and a binder (cellulose ether).\n\nConté crayons are most commonly found in black, white, and sanguine tones, as well as bistre, shades of grey, and other colors. Currently in the USA, sets of 12 assorted portrait and landscape colors are available as well as a sketching set, plus sets of 18, 24 or 48 colors. In Europe, 22 more colors are available and the colors other than sanguine, bistre, grey, black, and white are available open stock.\n\nColors sets are especially useful for field studies and color studies. Some artists create entire paintings with them, using them more like pastels than like a drawing medium. They are also used often to sketch under pastel paintings or lay down initial layers before using dry pastels. The colors sets lean toward very bright spectrum hues that mix well; even the 12 assorted color set can be layered to produce any hues or values desired. Color Conté mixes better on paper than many hard pastel products.\n\nThey are frequently used on rough paper that holds pigment grains well. They can also be used on prepared primed canvases for underdrawing for a painting. The sticks' square profile make Conté crayons more suitable for detailed hatched work as opposed to the bolder painterly drawing style demanded by soft pastels.\n\nIn the 1880s, Georges Seurat used Conté crayons to produce many of his studies.\n"}

Designed as centers for entertainment and moral education for the working class (\"lowbrow\"), the museums were distinctly different from upper middle class' cultural events (\"highbrow\"). In urban centers like New York City, where many immigrants settled, dime museums were popular and cheap entertainment. The social trend reached its peak during the Progressive Era (c. 1890–1920). Although lowbrow entertainment, they were the starting places for the careers of many notable vaudeville-era entertainers including Harry Houdini, Lew Fields, Joe Weber, and Maggie Cline.\n\nIn Baltimore, Maryland, Peale's Museum is credited as one of the first serious museums in the country. This type of attraction was re-created in the American Dime Museum in 1999, which operated for eight years before closing permanently and auctioning off its exhibits in late February 2007.\n\nKimball's Museum and Austin & Stones Museum in Scollay Square were both well-known attractions, the former having a friendly connection to, and sometimes competition with, P. T. Barnum. Barnum and Moses Kimball even shared \"Fee Gee Mermaids\" on a regular basis.\n\nBoth John James Audubon and sculptor Hiram Powers produced displays for the Western Museum, organized by Dr Daniel Drake in 1818 and continued by Joseph Dorfeuille. \"Satan and his Court\" wax figures with moving parts and glowing eyes are typical of these displays.\n\nOn Canal Street, \"Eugene Robinson's Museum and Theater\" featured entertainments on the hour and also presented some of its attractions on a nearby riverboat. The common promotion gimmick of a brass band at the front entrance of these Dime Museums featured some of the earliest documented traditional jazz; Robinson's riverboat museum also hired Papa Jack Laine.\n\nP.T. Barnum purchased Scudder's \"Dime Museum\" in 1841, and transformed it into one of the most popular single cultural sites that has ever existed, Barnum's American Museum. Together, P.T. Barnum and Moses Kimball introduced the so-called \"Edutainement\" which was a moralistic education realized through sensational freak shows, theater and circus performances, and many other means of entertainment. The first incarnation \"American Museum\" on Anne Street burned down in 1865. It was relocated further up Broadway, but this venue too, fell victim to fire.\n\nFor many years in the basement of the Playland Arcade in Times Square in New York City, Hubert's Museum featured acts such as sword swallower Lady Estelene, Congo The Jungle Creep, a flea circus, a half-man half-woman, and magicians such as Earl \"Presto\" Johnson. This museum was documented in photography by Diane Arbus. Later, in Times Square, mouse pitchman Tommy Laird opened a dime museum that featured Tisha Booty - \"the Human Pin Cushion\" - and several magicians including Lou Lancaster, Criss Capehart, Dorothy Dietrich, magician Dick Brooks, and others.\n\nMcNamara, Brooks. \"'A Congress of Wonders:' The Rise and Fall of the Dime Museum.\" \"Emerson Society Quarterly\" 20, no. 3 (1974): 216-232."}

{"id": "15440710", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15440710", "title": "Effects of pornography", "text": "Effects of pornography\n\nThe effects of pornography on individuals or their sexual relationships differ from person to person, and are often unclear. Pornography's association with addiction, for example, has been studied, but pornography addiction is not an officially recognized condition. While some literature reviews suggest that pornographic images and films can be addictive, insufficient evidence exists to draw conclusions. With regard to examinations of the possible effects on domestic violence, rape and child sexual abuse, several studies conclude the liberalization of pornography in society may be associated with decreased rape and other sexual violence rates, suggest no effect, or are inconclusive.\n\nWithin the field of pornography research, there are many challenges that arise due to strong opinions and feelings on the topic. Confirmation bias is prevalent due to societal taboos surrounding pornography. While many studies hypothesize about and study negative effects of pornography, few researchers explore potential benefits or positive aspects of pornography. A large percentage of studies suffer from methodological issues. In one meta-study by researchers at Middlesex University in England, over 40,000 papers and articles were submitted to the team for review and 276 or 0.69% were suitable for consideration due to the low quality of research within the field.\n\nIn \"Effects of Prolonged Consumption of Pornography\", a review of pornography research conducted for the Surgeon General of the United States in 1986, Zillmann noted that inconsistencies in the literature on pornography exist, but overall concluded that extensive viewing of pornographic material may produce some sociological effects he argued were negative, including a decreased respect for long-term, monogamous relationships, and an attenuated desire for procreation. He describes the hypothetical basis for these conclusions stating:The values expressed in pornography clash so obviously with the family concept, and they potentially undermine the traditional values that favor marriage, family, and children ... Pornographic scripts dwell on sexual engagements of parties who have just met, who are in no way attached or committed to each other, and who will part shortly, never to meet again ... Sexual gratification in pornography is not a function of emotional attachment, of kindness, of caring, and especially not of continuance of the relationship, as such continuance would translate into responsibilities, curtailments, and costs ...\n\nOther contemporary researchers disagreed, McKay & Dolf noting \"neglected in work on pornography is that adults capable of functioning in contemporary society are also quite able to distinguish the difference between reality and fantasy. That such a point requires stating is indicative of the overly simplistic model of human behaviour which is reflected in this type of work.\"\n\nThe effects as Gail Dines summarizes Zillman's 1989 study, include \"alters perceptions of sexuality; specifically, it fosters presumptions of popularity for less common sexual practices; breeds discontent with the physical appearance and the sexual performance of intimate partners; trivializes rape as a criminal offense and also trivializes sexual child abuse as a criminal offense; and promotes insensitivity toward victims of sexual violence and promotes men's beliefs that they would be capable of committing rape. In addition, habitual male consumers of common pornography appear to be at greater risk of becoming sexually callous and sexually violent toward women than occasional users.\"\n\nAvedon Carol has explained of Zillmann's term \"sexually callous\" that he meant \"a greater tolerance for homosexuality; a belief that women should be able to choose other priorities beside motherhood; less belief in marriage; a belief that women may enjoy sex and choose to participate in it for reasons other than pleasing their husbands or conceiving children - in short, the goals of most feminist groups of the time. Zillmann was unable to demonstrate any increase in misogynist or violent attitudes and desires, although he did try.\" and stated of the sponsor of the report \"Having noted the varied interpretability of Zillmann and Bryant's findings, the [USA] Surgeon-General's report said that the only reliable findings of the research that supposedly proved men were more callous towards women after looking at pornography was this: the group that saw pornography estimated more accurately the prevalence of sexual practices in society. The control group, which did not see the material, tended to underestimate grossly how common certain sexual acts were\" and commented \"But even this result may be less reliable than it appears, due to methodological problems. Zillmann and Bryant had tried to include non-students in their research, but many of them left the study group when they discovered they would be asked to look at pornography. This meant that the control group contained a different population - older, perhaps more settled married men, for example - and thus any differences in the answers the groups gave to the questions might only reflect different attitudes among the different groups, and not pornography effects at all. The study was no longer controlled. In the end, the research may only mean that older, married men are less critical of their partners than young, single psychology students, and that such young, educated men have more liberal attitudes about women's roles and homosexuality, and more realistic knowledge of sexual practices in society.\"\n\nPornography addiction is a purported behavioral addiction characterized by compulsive, repeated use of pornographic material until it causes serious negative consequences to one's physical, mental, social, and/or financial well-being. However, there is no diagnosis of pornography addiction in the current \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" (DSM-5). The DSM-5 considered the diagnosis of hypersexuality-related behavioral disorders (to which porn addiction was a subset), but rejected it because \"there is insufficient peer-reviewed evidence to establish the diagnostic criteria and course descriptions needed to identify these behaviors as mental disorders.\" Instead, some psychologists suggest that any maladaptive sexual symptoms represent a manifestation of an underlying disorder, such as depression or anxiety which is simply manifesting itself sexually, or, alternatively, there is no underlying disorder and the behavior simply is not maladaptive. These psychologists do not recognize the concept of addiction, only chemical dependence, and believe the concept and diagnosis to be stigmatizing and unhelpful.\n\nTwo 2016 neurology reviews found evidence of addiction related brain changes in internet pornography users. Psychological effects of these brain changes are described as desensitization to reward, a dysfunctional anxiety response, and impulsiveness. Another 2016 review suggests that internet behaviors, including the use of pornography, be considered potentially addictive, and that problematic use of online pornography be considered an \"internet-use disorder\".\n\nA controlled study describes the relationship between given behaviors or environmental conditions and health effects in a laboratory setting in which conditions other than those under study are effectively held constant across groups of participants receiving various levels of the experimental condition(s). Since it is considered that the only functional difference between groups is the level of experimental condition(s) received, researchers can strongly infer cause-and-effect relationships from statistically significant associations between experimental condition(s) and health consequences. Thus, if executed properly, controlled studies have high levels of internal validity. However, such studies often suffer from questionable external validity due to the considerable differences between real-world environments and the experimental context, and the consequent belief that results cannot be generalized beyond that context.\n\nThe link between pornography and sexual aggression has been the subject of multiple meta-analyses. Meta-analyses conducted in the 1990s suggested to researchers that there might not be an association of any kind between pornography and rape supportive attitudes in non-experimental studies. However, a meta-analysis by Hald, Malamuth and Yuen (2010) suggests that there is a link between consumption of violent pornography and rape-supportive attitudes in certain populations of men, particularly when moderating variables are taken into consideration.\n\nA meta-analysis conducted in 2015 found that pornography \"consumption was associated with sexual aggression in the United States and internationally, among males and females, and in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Associations were stronger for verbal than physical sexual aggression, although both were significant. The general pattern of results suggested that violent content may be an exacerbating factor.\"\n\nIn an earlier review of this literature Ferguson and Hartley (2009) argued that \"it is time to discard the hypothesis that pornography contributes to increased sexual assault behavior\". They stated that the authors of some studies tended to highlight positive findings while deemphasizing null findings, demonstrating confirmation bias in the published literature. Ferguson and Hartley concluded that controlled studies, on balance, were not able to support links between pornography and sexual violence.\n\nAn epidemiological study describes the association between given behaviors or environmental conditions, and physical or psychological health by means of observation of real-world phenomena through statistical data. Epidemiological studies generally have high levels of external validity, insofar as they accurately describe events as they occur outside of a laboratory setting, but low levels of internal validity, since they do not strongly establish cause-and-effect relationships between the behaviors or conditions under study, and the health consequences observed.\n\nDanish criminologist Berl Kutchinsky's \"Studies on Pornography and sex crimes in Denmark\" (1970), a scientific report ordered by the Presidential Commission on Obscenity and Pornography, found that the legalizing of pornography in Denmark had not resulted in an increase of sex crimes. Since then, many other experiments have been conducted, either supporting or opposing the findings of Berl Kutchinsky, who would continue his study into the social effects of pornography until his death in 1995. His life's work was summed up in the publication \"Law, Pornography, and Crime: The Danish Experience\" (1999). Milton Diamond from the University of Hawaii found that the number of reported cases of child sex abuse dropped markedly immediately after the ban on sexually explicit materials was lifted in 1969.\n\nSome researchers claim there is a correlation between pornography and a decrease of sex crimes, including Diamond (author of a review from 2009). \"The effects of Pornography: An International Perspective\" was an epidemiological study which found that the massive growth of the pornography industry in the United States between 1975 and 1995 was accompanied by a substantial decrease in the number of sexual assaults per capita, and reported similar results for Japan. Findings of this nature have been critiqued by Robert Peters, president of Morality in Media, on the grounds that the results are better explained by factors other than the increased prevalence of pornography: \"a more plausible explanation is that if there is a decline in \"forcible rape,\" it is the result of a tremendous effort to curb rape through community and school-based programs, media coverage, aggressive law enforcement, DNA evidence, longer prison sentences, and more.\"\n\nIn 1986, a review of epidemiological studies by Neil M. Malamuth found that the quantity of pornographic material viewed by men was positively correlated with degree to which they endorsed sexual assault. Malamuth's work describes Check (1984), who found among a diverse sample of Canadian men that more exposure to pornography led to higher acceptance of rape myths, violence against women, and general sexual callousness. In another study, Briere, Corne, Runtz and Neil M. Malamuth, (1984) reported similar correlations in a sample involving college males. On the other hand, the failure to find a statistically significant correlation in another previous study led Malamuth to examine other interesting correlations, which took into account the information about sexuality the samples obtained in their childhood, and pornography emerged as the second most important source of information. Malamuth's work has been criticized by other authors, however, such as Ferguson and Hartley (2009) who argue Malamuth has exaggerated positive findings and has not always properly discussed null findings.\n\nBecause pornographic film making involves unsimulated sex, usually without condoms (barebacking), pornographic actors appear to be particularly vulnerable to sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nThe AIDS Healthcare Foundation tried several times to have California’s Department of Industrial Relations, Division of Occupational Safety and Health’s Appeals Board force companies in the pornography industry to treat actors and actresses as employees subject to occupational safety and health regulation; in a 2014 case brought against Treasure Island Media an administrative judge found that the company did have to comply with regulations.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Association of Teachers and Lecturers feels schoolchildren need to be educated about pornography and warned what is reasonable and what is not acceptable. The UK children's commissioner initiated a meta-study conducted by researchers at Middlesex University which concluded that pornography is linked to unrealistic attitudes about sex, beliefs that women are sex objects, more frequent thoughts about sex, and found that children and young people who view pornography tend to hold less progressive gender role attitudes. Miranda Horvath stated about this: \"But it is not possible to establish causation from correlational studies, and to say whether pornography is changing or reinforcing attitudes.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3477950", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3477950", "title": "Egyptian National Library and Archives", "text": "Egyptian National Library and Archives\n\nThe Egyptian National Library and Archives (; \"Dar el-Kotob\") are located in Cairo and is the largest library in Egypt. The second largest libraries in Egypt are Al-Azhar University and the Bibliotheca Alexandrina (New Library of Alexandria). The Egyptian National Library and Archives are a non-profit government organization.\n\nThe National Library houses several million volumes on a wide range of topics. It is one of the largest in the world with thousands of ancient collections. It contains a vast variety of Arabic-language and other Eastern manuscripts, the oldest in the world. The main library is a seven-story building in Ramlet Boulaq, a district of Cairo. The Egyptian National Archives are contained in an annex beside the building.\n\nThe National Archives, located in an annex beside the library, houses a vast and diverse collection. The holdings are particularly significant to those who work on Egyptian social and political history, although it is open to the public. \n\nKhedive Isma'il Pasha, also known as Ismail the Magificent, was devoted to cultural development and modernization of Egypt during his rule. He introduced the project of the National Library of Egypt (formerly, Kotub Khana of Egypt) in March 23, 1870. Ali Pasha Mubarak, the Minister of Education of Egypt during that time, was appointed the job of collecting materials to place in the library by Ismail. The materials were obtained from Sultans, Princes, and scholars and were taken from Mosques, shrines, and schools to form the library's holdings. In Egypt, a library is called a bookhouse. Ali Pasha Mubarak placed many different languages within the collection, a representation of the diverse sources of Egyptian culture and knowledge. \n\nThe library, which was originally housed in Darb al-Gamamiz, was built to look like the National Library of Paris. Their aim was to emulate the great library's in Europe at the time. After a mandate passed in 1886 that required all new books and publications to be deposited within the library’s holdings, it outgrew its repository. A new building was erected for the library in 1904 in Bab al-Khalq and shared its space with the Museum of Islamic Art. The library was moved to its current and much larger location in 1971, where it overlooks the Nile on the Corniche in Ramle Boulak. The current location is several buildings comprising the library, which has modern features for the public and researchers, book storage, a scientific center, and the administrative offices. \n\nCollections include a wide variety of manuscripts of the Qur'an, written on paper and parchment. Some of which date back to early Kufic script. Others are written by celebrated calligraphers. Of Egyptian Islamic materials, there is perhaps the outstanding collection of illuminated manuscripts of the Qur'an in the Mamluk text-hand, and in Trilinear and Rayhani hands. There are also collections of Arabic papyri from different sites in Egypt, some dating to the 7th century AD or earlier. The library is a mine of information on early Islamic Egypt's social and cultural life. Ancient Persian and Ottoman documents are also part of the collection.\n\nThe library remains Egypt's largest resource of manuscripts and documents that include more than 57,000 of the most valuable manuscripts in the world. The manuscript collection covers a vast number of subjects, fully documented, dated, and compiled. It also houses a rare number of Arabic papyri. These are related to marriage, rent, and exchange contracts, as well as records, accounts of taxes, distribution of inheritance, etc. The oldest papyrus group dates back to the year AH 87 (AD 705); only 444 papyri from this collection were published.\n\nThe Library also has a large collection of medieval Arabic coins from as early as AD 696, which were published by Stanley Lane-Poole, Bernhardt Moritz and recently by Norman D. Nicol, Jere L. Bacharach and Rifa'at al-Nabarawy in 1982. These collections are of high archeological value. \n\nCollections formed by Ahmed Taymour Pasha, Ahmed Zaki Pasha, Ahmed Tal'aat Bey and Mustafa Fadel all came to the National Library at the end of the 19th century.\n\nOn Friday, January 24, 2014, a car bomb meant to destroy the Police Headquarters across the street from the National Library and Archives did quite a bit of damage to the library's building and collections. National Library and Archive head Abdul Nasser Hassan estimated that the losses would be around $2.81 million in repairs. Lighting and ventilation systems were destroyed, along with the Islamic architectural facade, which crumbled to the ground. Showcases and displays containing irreplaceable ancient manuscripts and papyri were damaged, along with all the furniture in the building. The conservation staff at the National Library and Archive's were able to save the documents on display, although they did sustain some damage. \n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "34812933", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34812933", "title": "Elfie Hopkins", "text": "Elfie Hopkins\n\nElfie Hopkins is a British horror film directed by Ryan Andrews and co-written by Riyad Barmania and Ryan Andrews. It stars Jaime Winstone, Ray Winstone, Steven Mackintosh, Rupert Evans, Aneurin Barnard and Kimberley Nixon. The film tells the story of an aspiring detective, Elfie Hopkins (Jaime Winstone), who stumbles into her first real case, when investigating the mysterious new family, the Gammons, in her neighbourhood. The film was released in the UK on 20 April 2012.\n\n\"Elfie Hopkins\" tells the story of twenty-two-year-old slacker (Jaime Winstone), a \"wanna-be\" detective, set in a sleepy hunting village. She is a stoner and an animal lover, and haunted by the death of her mother and surrounded by her broken father and alcoholic step-mother, Elfie seeks solace and inspiration from the old school detectives in \"The Maltese Falcon\" and \"Chinatown\". She entertains herself, along with her geeky best friend, Dylan (Aneurin Barnard), by investigating the villagers and upsetting everyone with their imaginative allegations. Elfie's mundane existence is thrown for a spin with the arrival of a family of trendy city dwellers, the Gammons.\n\nThe Gammons weave tales of adventure and seduce the villagers with offers of exotic hunting holidays around the world. It is not long before the villagers are flying off to the four corners of the world. Elfie, despite her best efforts, is not free to the Gammons' charms, but soon smells a rat. Elfie and Dylan begin investigating the Gammons' life. Bloody violence and pandemonium soon starts to rage in the village and it is no longer just the blood of animals. Elfie discovers the villagers are not making those flights and when she finally uncovers the truth, it is darker than she could have ever imagined.\n\n\nDirector Ryan Andrews became friends with Winstone when he was part of the camera crew for \"Daddy's Girl\", an independent Welsh film made in 2006, which also starring Winstone as a teen with a twisted lust for blood. Extending their shared love of fantasy, horror and anything grunge-related, Elfie Hopkins is, says Andrews, \"a combination of an eclectic mix of British twee and American grunge – a weird mash-up of two worlds with a heightened comic-strip feel.\"\n\nThe film is based on short film by Andrews called The Gammons and it was this concept that Andrews, with co-writer Riyad Barmania, turned into a feature film script. \"The Elfie character played a minor role in the short,\" explains Andrews. \"But after meeting Jaime I knew she could become the main focus and make it something really special and unique in British horror fantasy terms. Elfie is a finely tuned representation of my own childhood memories growing up in rural Wales. I often used to imagine myself as a vampire hunter let loose on a community of surreal country folk. Riyad and I have taken those already magnified experiences and transformed them further... and the film is informed by everything between author Roald Dahl and The Lost Boys to Brit photographer Tim Walker.\"\n\nWinstone says: \"Ryan and I have been looking forward to making this film for years since our styles just collided and we really hit it off. It feels the right time to capture that 1990s vibe now.\"\n\n\"Elfie Hopkins has been an alter ego of mine for a while now,\" Winstone says, \"and I can't wait for the world to meet her. She'll kick ass! For me, Elfie's a dream role to play, and I feel there is a gap in the British film industry which we will more than fill! I can't wait to work with Ryan Andrews—he is a young and exciting director with a vision that can match my imagination.\"\n\nThe soundtrack for Elfie Hopkins was written by Cardiff Producer Jordan Andrews and recorded at his local studio Ripefruit Recordings. British musician Charli XCX also provided two songs for the Elfie Hopkins soundtrack along with The Big Pink.\n\nThe film received predominantly negative reviews by critics. It currently has a 0% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 2.9/10 based on 15 reviews.\n\nTime Out claimed the film was \"sunk by a lame script and mannered performances\" while Total Film commented that \"The Twin Peaks mood writer/director that Ryan Andrews musters in his sleepy village setting, not to mention the striking costume and production design, has real promise.\" The Observer stated it was \"an orgy of mistimed jokes, stumbling narration and dim performances.\" However, Peter Bradshaw in The Guardian wrote that \"It doesn't totally take off until the final act, but there's evidence here that Ryan Andrews will become a force to be reckoned with.\"\n"}
{"id": "1636825", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1636825", "title": "Final Fantasy XIII", "text": "Final Fantasy XIII\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII is a science fiction role-playing video game developed and published by Square Enix for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles and later for the Microsoft Windows operating system. Released in Japan in December 2009 and worldwide in March 2010, it is the thirteenth title in the mainline \"Final Fantasy\" series. The game includes fast-paced combat, a new system for the series for determining which abilities are developed for the characters called \"Crystarium\", and a customizable \"Paradigm\" system to control which abilities are used by the characters. \"Final Fantasy XIII\" includes elements from the previous games in the series, such as summoned monsters, chocobos, and airships.\n\nThe game takes place in the fictional floating world of Cocoon, whose government, the Sanctum, is ordering a purge of civilians who have supposedly come into contact with Pulse, the much-feared world below. The former soldier Lightning begins her fight against the government in order to save her sister who has been branded as an unwilling servant to a god-like being from Pulse, making her an enemy of Cocoon. Lightning is soon joined by a band of allies, and together the group also become marked by the same Pulse creature. They rally against the Sanctum while trying to discover their assigned task and whether they can avoid being turned into monsters or crystals at the completion.\n\nDevelopment began in 2004, and the game was first announced at Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2006. \"Final Fantasy XIII\" is the flagship title of the \"Fabula Nova Crystallis\" collection of \"Final Fantasy\" games and is the first game to use Square Enix's Crystal Tools engine. \"Final Fantasy XIII\" received mostly positive reviews from video game publications, which praised the game's graphics, presentation, and battle system. The game's story received a mixed response from reviewers, and its linearity compared to previous games in the series was mostly criticized. Selling 1.7 million copies in Japan in 2009, \"Final Fantasy XIII\" became the fastest-selling title in the history of the series. As of 2017, the game has sold over 7 million copies worldwide. The Microsoft Windows version has sold over 700,000 copies according to SteamSpy. A sequel, titled \"Final Fantasy XIII-2\", was released in December 2011 in Japan and in February 2012 in North America and PAL regions. A second sequel, titled \"\", which concludes Lightning's story and the \"Final Fantasy XIII\" series, was released in November 2013 in Japan and in February 2014 in North America and PAL regions. In September 2014, Square Enix announced the \"Final Fantasy XIII\" series has been widely successful and has shipped over 11 million copies worldwide.\n\nThe player directly controls the on-screen character through a third-person perspective to interact with people, objects, and enemies throughout the game. The player can also turn the camera around the characters, which allows for a 360° view of the surroundings. The world of \"Final Fantasy XIII\" is rendered to scale relative to the characters in it; instead of a caricature of the character roaming around miniature terrain, as found in the earlier \"Final Fantasy\" games, every area is represented proportionally. The player navigates the world by foot or by chocobo. Players may save their game to a hard disk drive using save stations, where the player can also purchase items from retail networks or upgrade their weapons. An in-game datalog provides a bestiary and incidental information about the world of \"Final Fantasy XIII\". The \"Final Fantasy XIII Ultimate Hits International\" version of the game, released in Japan, also contains an \"Easy\" mode option.\n\nAs in \"Final Fantasy XII\", enemies are integrated into the open field and can be approached or avoided by the player. When the player's character touches an enemy, the screen transitions from the regular map to a separate battle screen similar to those used in previous \"Final Fantasy\" titles. A maximum of three characters may be used in battles, which use a variant on the series' traditional Active Time Battle (ATB) system first featured in \"Final Fantasy IV\". Under this system, the player selects an action from the menus, such as Attack, Magic, and Item. Unlike previous games in the series, the player only controls the lead character while the remaining two characters are controlled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI). Each action requires a specific number of slots on the ATB bar, which continually refills to a set maximum number of slots. The ATB bar gradually increases in size throughout the game from two slots to six. The player may select less than the maximum number of possible actions, or may stop the filling of the ATB bar and perform as many actions as can be done with the current ATB amount. The player may select an autobattle command, which fills the ATB slots with actions chosen automatically. Actions cannot be performed outside of battle, and the characters' health is fully restored after each battle.\n\nEach enemy has a meter, called a chain counter, consisting of a percentage starting at 100 which increases when the enemy is struck by attacks or spells. Attacks by different roles have different effects; some raise the chain by a larger amount while others give the player longer before the chain counter resets. The amount of damage performed by an attack is multiplied by the chain percentage before it is applied to the enemy. When the chain counter reaches a preset amount, different for each enemy, the enemy is placed into Stagger State. In this mode, the enemy has lowered defense and may be launched into the air. The Paradigm system allows the player to program six different roles which the characters can then assume to perform certain formations in battle in response to the specific conditions. The roles consist of Commando, a warrior-type role; Ravager, a black mage-type role which uses damage-dealing magic; Medic, a White Mage-type role which can heal and remove negative status ailments; Saboteur, which uses magic to weaken enemies by inflicting negative statuses; Synergist, which uses magic to strengthen allies by giving positive statuses; and Sentinel, which has protective and defensive abilities similar to a paladin. Each of the characters can initially take on only three roles, but the player has access to all of them later in the game (although the other three roles are limited in their abilities for those players which choose them). The player can select which roles the controlled character and the AI characters are using both outside and during battle, which is the only way that the player can control the AI characters during battle. The player can only choose from specific sets of paradigms that the player has set up beforehand outside of battle.\n\nEach character can summon a specific Eidolon into battle. These summoned creatures include series staples Odin, Shiva, Alexander, and Bahamut, and newcomers Hecatoncheir and Brynhildr. When summoned, the Eidolon stays in combat while the characters accompanying the summoner leave the party. While an Eidolon is summoned, the player can trigger a feature called Gestalt Mode, in which the Eidolon transforms into a different form and performs different attacks while the summoning character rides them.\n\nThe Crystarium is a leveling system consisting of six crystals and resembles the Sphere Grid from \"Final Fantasy X\". Each crystal in the Crystarium represents one of the six Paradigms, and is divided into ten levels. Each level contains various nodes that supply bonuses to health, strength, or magic, or provide new abilities and accessory slots. These nodes are connected by a semi-linear path. The player may advance down the path by acquiring Crystarium Points, which are awarded after defeating enemies. The full Crystarium is not available to the player at the beginning of the game; at specific points in the game's plot, the player gains access to new crystals or levels.\n\n\"Final Fantasy XIII\" is set on the world of Gran Pulse (often simply called Pulse). Central to the story is Cocoon, a massive artificial sphere that floats above Pulse's surface and is ruled by the Sanctum, a theocratic government. The two worlds are controlled by fal'Cie , mechanical beings with godlike power. The Cocoon fal'Cie are responsible for keeping Cocoon floating, as well as providing light and water to the people that live inside. Each fal'Cie handles a specific task. The fal'Cie have the capability of marking the humans that live in Pulse and Cocoon as their servants. These servants, called l'Cie , are branded with a symbol representing either Pulse or Cocoon and are given a \"Focus\"—a task to complete. If the l'Cie complete their task in time, they are transformed to crystal and according to legend gain eternal life; otherwise they become mindless monsters called Cie'th . The l'Cie are not explicitly told their Focus, but are instead given visions that they must interpret.\n\nSeveral hundred years before the events of the game, a battle known as the War of Transgression took place between Pulse and Cocoon. During the battle, l'Cie from Pulse attacked and ripped a large hole in Cocoon. Eventually, the l'Cie completed their focus and were turned to crystal. The hole was patched with material lifted from Pulse, and Cocoon's citizens have since lived in fear of another invasion; this fear is used by the Sanctum to remain in power. The Sanctum oversees two military branches: the Guardian Corps, responsible for keeping order on Cocoon, and the Public Security and Intelligence COMmand (PSICOM), the special forces in charge of dealing with any threat related to Pulse. The fal'Cie have given the humans advanced technology, including flying airships and mechanical creatures, and a form of magic also exists. This magic is normally only accessible to l'Cie, fal'Cie, and various monsters in Cocoon and Pulse, though distilled chemical forms can be used by normal humans through the use of Manadrives.\n\nThe six main playable characters of \"Final Fantasy XIII\" are Lightning, the main protagonist of the game, a former soldier and older sister to Serah; Snow Villiers, Serah's fiancé and leader of NORA, a paramilitary group; Oerba Dia Vanille, the game's narrator and an exile who is later revealed to be a l'Cie from Pulse; Sazh Katzroy, a civilian pilot and father to a young boy, Dajh; Hope Estheim, a young boy who is struggling within the relationships he shares with his parents; and Oerba Yun Fang, a l'Cie from Pulse who is working with the Sanctum's Cavalry branch. Other characters include Galenth Dysley, the ruler of the Sanctum and main antagonist; Cid Raines, a Sanctum Brigadier General in the Cavalry who does not trust the government; and Serah Farron, Lightning's younger sister and Snow's fiancée.\n\nIn Cocoon, the citizens of the town of Bodhum are being evicted, or Purged, after coming in contact with something from Pulse. Over the course of the game, the player is shown flashbacks of the events of the previous thirteen days, which began when a fal'Cie from Pulse was discovered near Bodhum. Lightning's sister Serah had found the fal'Cie from Pulse and been changed into a l'Cie by it. Lightning and Sazh derail a Purge train bound for Pulse in an attempt to save Serah. As Snow leads his resistance group NORA to rescue the Purge exiles, several of them are killed. Heading to the fal'Cie Anima to save Serah, Snow is joined by two of the exiles: Hope and Vanille. The two parties meet at the fal'Cie, and find Serah just as she turns to crystal. Anima then brands them as l'Cie and they are cast out into a different part of Cocoon. During this transformation, the newly crested l'Cie all have the same vision: a monster called Ragnarok. Arguing over the ambiguous nature of the dreamed Focus, the party finds Serah in her crystallized form; Snow remains with her as the others leave.\n\nSnow meets Cid and Fang, two members of the Cavalry, after he is captured and detained aboard the airship \"Lindblum\". Meanwhile, the others flee from PSICOM before getting separated by an airstrike; Hope and Lightning travel to Palumpolum, while Sazh and Vanille travel to Nautilus. In Lightning's scenario, she unintentionally supports Hope's goal of killing Snow to avenge his mother's death. In Vanille's scenario, Sazh discusses how his son Dajh was turned into a l'Cie by a Cocoon fal'Cie and was taken by PSICOM to discover his Focus. In Palumpolum, Lightning attempts to dissuade Hope from going through with his revenge and meets Snow and Fang. Fang reveals that she and Vanille were l'Cie from Pulse who were turned into crystals; they were turned back into humans 13 days earlier, sparking the Purge. Hope attempts to murder Snow, but after being rescued during an airstrike, he decides not to go through with it. The four then flee the city with Cid's aid. In Nautilus, Vanille reveals herself to Sazh as a l'Cie from Pulse, and indirectly the reason that Dajh was turned into a l'Cie. Sazh and Vanille are then captured and detained on board the airship \"Palamecia\".\n\nOn the \"Palamecia\", the other members of the party reunite with Vanille and Sazh before they confront Galenth Dysley, the Sanctum's Primarch, who is the Cocoon fal'Cie ruler Barthandelus in disguise. Barthandelus tells the party that their Focus is to transform into the beast Ragnarok and slay the sleeping fal'Cie Orphan, who keeps Cocoon afloat above Pulse. Slaying Orphan will result in the destruction of Cocoon. The party flees and learns from Cid that the fal'Cie believe that Cocoon's destruction will summon the Maker, the creator of the worlds. The fal'Cie cannot harm Orphan themselves. Vanille and Fang reveal to the party that they were involved in the War of Transgression centuries earlier, and that their Focus then had been the same: to transform into Ragnarok and attempt to destroy Orphan. The party flies away to Pulse and journeys to Oerba, Vanille and Fang's hometown, where they hope to learn how to remove their l'Cie marks. The town is deserted, and they find no living people on the surface. The party is unsuccessful in removing their marks, and Barthandelus confronts them again. The party learns that Barthandelus has made Cid the new Primarch to create chaos in Cocoon to force the Cavalry to attack Cid and Orphan in a coup d'état.\n\nThe party infiltrates Cocoon and heads towards Orphan but soon discover that the Cavalry have been turned into Cie'th. The party defeats Barthandelus, but Orphan awakens and merges with Barthandelus, then compels Fang to finish her Focus as Ragnarok while the others are seemingly transformed into Cie'th. The party reappears in human form, preventing Fang from transforming. The party defeats Orphan and escapes Cocoon, which is now falling towards Pulse. As the rest of the party turns to crystal for completing their Focus, Vanille and Fang remain on Cocoon and transform into Ragnarok together to prevent a collision between Cocoon and Pulse. The rest of the party awaken from their crystallization on Pulse and find their l'Cie brands gone; Lightning, Hope, Snow and Sazh reunite with Serah and Dajh.\n\nDevelopment of \"Final Fantasy XIII\" began in February 2004, shortly after the release of \"Final Fantasy X-2 International + Last Mission\" in Japan. At the time, the project was internally referred to by the codename \"Colors World\". Over the first year, director Motomu Toriyama and scenario conceptor Kazushige Nojima conceived ideas for the plot. Nojima thought up the crystal mythology that became the basis for the \"Fabula Nova Crystallis\" series, including concepts such as the fal'Cie and l'Cie. Toriyama then created a story premised on this mythology. He wanted to portray \"characters at the mercy of a predetermined, unjust fate\" who \"belong together but collide heavily\". In order to achieve this, each of the story's thirteen chapters was made to focus on different protagonists. Chapters seven and eight were to mark a turning point in the interpersonal relationships of the party.\n\nIn March 2006, when the structural part of the narrative started to come together, lead scenario writer Daisuke Watanabe joined the team. Toriyama gave him a rough outline of the first eight chapters, which included several cornerstone scenes that needed to be kept, like when party members were separated or reunited. He told Watanabe what he wanted to express with the scenario, and asked him to flesh out the story and to strengthen how the points in his outline connected. For example, Toriyama's rudimentary instructions in the document would say \"Snow and Hope reconcile\". Watanabe had to decide about how the scenes with this reconciliation would play out, then write the scenario that way. To emphasize what the story tried to express, Watanabe adjusted the personalities Toriyama had given to each character. For example, he felt that the party should not have a \"reliable and calm leader type\" at the beginning of the story, in order to more accurately show the confusion and unease after the protagonists transform into l'Cie. Toriyama has said that one of the storytelling challenges was the despair of the characters and the many points at which they are seemingly cornered. He mentioned the scene where Sazh tries to commit suicide as one such example: Although Toriyama felt it was \"almost a little too dark\", he wanted to include something like it in the game. In contrast, he said that lighthearted elements such as Sazh's Chocobo chick helped maintain a good balance.\n\nAt the beginning of the development, the game was intended to be released on the PlayStation 2. In May 2005, however, after the positive reception of the tech demo of \"Final Fantasy VII\", the team decided to move the game to the PlayStation 3 and developed it with the new Crystal Tools engine, a seventh generation multiplatform game engine created by Square Enix for its next generation games. Square Enix believed that developing a new engine would speed up development time later in the project, though it would initially cause a delay in the game's development. However, the delay was longer than originally anticipated as the engine had to accommodate the requirements of several other games in addition to \"XIII\". Another factor in the platform move was the delayed release of \"Final Fantasy XII\", which came out a very short time before the release of the PlayStation 3. A PC port was considered during development, but was decided against due to how Square Enix saw the video game market situation at the time as well as additional complexities that Square Enix did not have experience with related to the PC platform, such as security issues. \"Final Fantasy XIII\" was first shown at the 2006 E3 convention. The trailer shown was an artistic concept that did not represent the final concept for the game, since at the time there was no playable form of the game. Announced alongside the game was \"Final Fantasy Versus XIII\", later retitled as \"Final Fantasy XV\", and the PlayStation Portable game \"Final Fantasy Type-0\", originally titled \"Final Fantasy Agito XIII\", the three of which form the \"Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy\" series. Square Enix explained that although all three games are thematically linked, they are not directly related in terms of story.\n\nThe developers for \"Final Fantasy XIII\" were divided into multiple areas, with each developer or team focusing only on a specific task such as developing a specific in-game area or modeling characters. Each physical area of the game was developed separately; after an initial design was approved, teams were assigned to a specific location and filled in details without reusing assets from other areas. Several of the game's developers had worked on previous installments of the series. Director Motomu Toriyama had worked on \"Final Fantasy X\" and \"X-2\"; producer Yoshinori Kitase had worked on \"V\" through \"VIII\" and as the producer for \"X\" and \"X-2\"; main-character designer Tetsuya Nomura had performed the same role for \"VII\", \"VIII\", \"X\", and \"X-2\", and battle-system director Toshiro Tsuchida reprised that role from \"Final Fantasy X\". As \"XIII\" was the first \"Final Fantasy\" game for the PlayStation 3, the development team's internal goal was for the game to have the same \"gameplay and craftmanship\" impact that \"Final Fantasy VII\" and \"X\" had as the first games of the series on their respective consoles. They aimed to sell five million copies of the game. Toriyama wanted the game to be \"the ultimate single player RPG\".\n\nTsuchida's concept for the battle system was to maintain the strategic nature of command-based battles. The system stemmed from a desire to create battles similar to those found in the film \"\". Magic points (MP), which had been a part of the battle system in previous \"Final Fantasy\" titles, were removed in the game's battle system as Tsuchida and the other designers felt that it gave players an incentive to not use their most powerful magic attacks due to the MP cost, in turn making battles less interesting. The Paradigm system was designed early in the battle system's development, with the intent of making battles rely on quickly changing strategies and feel fast-moving. Originally there were only five roles, but the Saboteur was later added as the designers felt that its abilities were missing from the game and did not fit with the other roles. Together with the maximum of three characters in a combat situation, the groupings of enemies were designed to force the player to switch Paradigms to keep them engaged in the battles.\n\nToriyama wanted Lightning to be a new type of female character with an athlete's body and a less feminine nature than some of the previous female characters of the series. His guideline to Nomura was to make her \"strong and beautiful\", and she was intended to be reminiscent of \"Final Fantasy VII\"s Cloud Strife. Fang was initially meant to be a male character, but the gender was changed to coincide with the updated character designs during the latter part of development. The graphics capabilities of the PS3 and Xbox 360 compared to previous consoles allowed Nomura to use more complex elements in the character designs than before, such as Lightning's cape and detailed facial features. This in turn meant that the art team had to do much more work for each character or area than in previous games. Nomura did not take an involved role in the creation of the non-playable characters.\n\nUnlike previous games in the series which were more inspired by Asian locations and culture, \"Final Fantasy XIII\" was intended by the art team to be reminiscent of the United States. Pulse was based on landscape photographs the team took from across the country, and Cocoon was intended to be a \"melting pot\" of different ethnicities. The setting was also given a science fiction aesthetic to make it stand out more in comparison with other entries in the series. Art director Isamu Kamikokuryo revealed that many additional scenarios such as Lightning's home, which were functioning in an unreleased build during development, were left out of the final version due to concerns about the game's length and volume. Kamikokuryo said the content they cut was, in itself, enough to make another game. According to Toriyama, the cuts were made in \"various stages of [the game's] development\", and that some of the content was removed just before the game's completion. The game, unlike previous titles in the series, includes no explorable town areas; Toriyama said in an interview that the team was unable to make them as graphically appealing as the rest of the game and chose to eliminate them. Toriyama intended to have a piece of downloadable content available for the game that would include a new area, weapons and quests, but was forced to cut it as well due to quality concerns so late in the project and difficulties with the different systems for extra content on the two gaming consoles.\n\nA playable demo of \"Final Fantasy XIII\" was included in the Japanese version of \"\", released on April 16, 2009. Toriyama stated that the release of the demo, which was not in the original development schedule, helped the team recognize a shared vision for what the game should look and feel like, a problem which had been plaguing the development team up until then. It helped the team prioritize the work that still needed to be done, which increased the development speed for the remainder of the project. The game was intended to appeal to both Western and Japanese audiences, and focus groups from both regions were used. The English localization began while development was still in progress to lessen the delay between the Japanese and worldwide releases. The game was initially going to be released solely for the PlayStation 3, but an Xbox 360 version was announced late in the game's development cycle. The Xbox version, due to technical limitations, runs at a lower resolution (720p maximum) than the PlayStation version and is spread across 3 discs.\n\nMasashi Hamauzu composed the game's soundtrack; his previous work on the series was as a co-composer for \"Final Fantasy X\" and as the main composer for \"\". The game was the first main-series \"Final Fantasy\" game to not include any compositions by original series composer Nobuo Uematsu. Although Uematsu was originally announced to compose the main theme of the game, this role was taken over by Hamauzu after Uematsu signed on to compose the soundtrack to \"Final Fantasy XIV\". The score features some pieces orchestrated by Yoshihisa Hirano, Toshiyuki Oomori, and Kunihito Shiina, with the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra. The song \"My Hands\", from British singer Leona Lewis' second album \"Echo\", was chosen to replace \"Final Fantasy XIII\"'s original theme song, \"Kimi ga Iru Kara\" by Sayuri Sugawara, for the game's international release. Square Enix president Yoichi Wada later said that it would have been better if the American branch of the company had produced a theme song from scratch, but a lack of staff led to the decision of licensing an existing song.\n\nMusic from the game has been released in several albums. Square Enix released the main soundtrack album, \"Final Fantasy XIII Original Soundtrack\", on four Compact Discs in 2010. The album sold 16,000 copies the day of its release. Square Enix released selections from the soundtrack on two gramophone record albums in 2010: \"W/F: Music from Final Fantasy XIII\" and \"W/F: Music from Final Fantasy XIII Gentle Reveries\". An album of arranged pieces from the soundtrack, \"Final Fantasy XIII Original Soundtrack -PLUS-\", was also released by Square Enix in 2010, as was an album of piano arrangements. For Life Music published a single of the theme song for the Japanese version of the game, \"Kimi ga Iru Kara\" (君がいるから, \"Because You're Here\"), in 2009.\n\nThe game was released in Japan on December 17, 2009, and in North America, Europe and Australia on March 9, 2010. Alongside the release of the game in Japan, Japanese alcoholic beverage distributor Suntory released the \"Final Fantasy XIII Elixir\" to promote the game. On the same day, a \"Final Fantasy XIII\" PlayStation Home personal space was made available for free in Japan until January 13, 2010, along with a costume and personal space furnishings; they were released to the Asian, European, and North American versions of PlayStation Home on March 11, 2010. On December 18, 2012, the game was re-released as part of the \"Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box\" Japanese package. It was re-released again on November 21, 2013, as part of the Lightning Ultimate box, a Japan exclusive edition which includes \"Final Fantasy XIII\" and its two sequels.\n\nThe game was released bundled with consoles in different regions. The game was bundled in Japan with a limited-edition white PlayStation 3 with a pink color print of Lightning on the surface of the console, and with an Xbox 360 with the silver strip on the hard drive emblazoned with the \"Final Fantasy XIII\" logo in the western release. A limited quantity of themed Xbox faceplates created by Nomura were made available through a select few retailers in Europe, North America, and Australia. PAL territories received a limited collector's edition of the game for both Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, with the \"Final Fantasy XIII Original Sound Selection\" \"best of\" soundtrack CD, three Eidolon art prints, a \"Brand of the l'Cie\" decal and \"The World of Final Fantasy XIII\", a hardback book featuring character artwork, CG-rendered artwork, and environments from across the game production. Square Enix published three Ultimania books: the \"Final Fantasy XIII Scenario Ultimania\" and the \"Final Fantasy XIII Battle Ultimania\" on January 28, 2010, and the \"Final Fantasy XIII Ultimania Ω\" on September 30, 2010. The \"Battle Ultimania\" provides a description and analysis of the new battle system and its components, and developer interviews. The \"Scenario Ultimania\" describes the main scenarios in the game, profiles on the characters and areas in Cocoon and Gran Pulse, developer interviews, and details on each location. The last guide, the \"Ultimania Ω\", includes voice actor and additional staff interviews, the complete story of \"Final Fantasy XIII\" including additional character profiles, a collection of artworks and illustrations, and additional dissections of the story and background.\n\nWhile the game was released on both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in western regions, the game was a PlayStation 3 exclusive in Asian territories. This was changed in late 2010 when Square Enix announced that the Xbox 360 version would in fact release in Japan, despite many statements to the opposite. It was later released for Microsoft Windows via Steam, along with its two sequels. \"Final Fantasy XIII\" was the first game in the series to receive an official release in Chinese and Korean. This was the first edition of a \"Final Fantasy\" game in which Japanese voice-overs could be enabled. An international version of the game for the Xbox 360 called \"Final Fantasy XIII Ultimate Hits International\" was released in Asia on December 16, 2010. The game includes an \"Easy\" mode option, and features the English voices. It comes with a bonus booklet titled \"Final Fantasy XIII Corridor of Memory\" that contains content that was previously left out of the original version of the game and a short story epilogue titled \"Final Fantasy XIII Episode I\".\n\n\"Final Fantasy XIII\" was released for iOS and Android devices via cloud streaming in Japan on April 10, 2015.\n\n\"Final Fantasy XIII\" sold over one million units on its first day of sale in Japan, and had sold 1.7 million copies for the PlayStation 3 in Japan by the end of 2009, and 1.9 million by the end of 2010. Square Enix had anticipated high initial sales for the game and shipped close to two million units for its launch. The game sold more than one million copies in North America in its release month. In March 2010, Square Enix stated that \"Final Fantasy XIII\" was the fastest-selling title in the franchise's history. By April of the same year, American game sales for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 reached an estimated 800,000 and 500,000 units respectively. As of January 2013, the game had sold 6.6 million copies worldwide. According to Media Create, female gamers accounted for nearly a third of the game's Japanese fanbase. The Steam version has sold over 600,000 copies as of July 2016. As of July 2012, a combined total of 9.7 million units has been sold on consoles for both \"Final Fantasy XIII\" and its sequel \"Final Fantasy XIII-2\". In September 2014, Square Enix announced the \"Final Fantasy XIII\" series has been widely successful and has shipped over 11 million copies worldwide. As of 2017, the game has sold over 7 million copies worldwide.\n\n\"Final Fantasy XIII\" received generally positive reviews. Review aggregator website Metacritic gave the PlayStation 3 version 83/100 based on 83 reviews, the Xbox 360 version 82/100 based on 54 reviews, and the Microsoft Windows version 65/100 based on 6 reviews. It was rated 39 out of 40 by the Japanese gaming magazine \"Famitsu\". \"Dengeki\" praised the game for the battle system, stating that the battles are by far the most exciting in the series, and concluded \"Final Fantasy XIII\" deserved a score of 120, as 100 would not be enough. The game was voted as the second best game of 2009 in Dengeki Online's reader poll, and in January 2010, it was voted the best game ever in \"Famitsu\" reader poll. The game received a Best RPG of the year award nomination at the Spike Video Game Awards, but lost to \"Mass Effect 2\". It won the \"Future Division\" award at the Japan Game Awards 2009 and later won a Game Designers Award at the Japan Game Awards 2010.\n\nUniversal praise was given to the technical milestones achieved by the game's graphics and presentation. \"Edge\" felt that Cocoon in particular was an \"inspired setting [...] blessed with a vibrancy and vivid colour that often leaves you open-mouthed\". GameSpot called the art design \"magnificent\". Further praise was given to the pre-rendered animation sequences and the almost seamless transition of visual quality between these and the realtime gameplay. Many also appreciated the game's soundtrack, with Masashi Hamauzu providing \"a score with catchy hooks and blood-pumping battle melodies\", according to \"Wired\".\n\nThe battle system of \"Final Fantasy XIII\" received widespread praise. The increased pace of battles was appreciated, with several reviews describing it as \"thrilling\"; \"Edge\"s description of the battle system summarized it as \"among the genre's finest\". 1UP.com said that \"Despite the fact that two-thirds of your party is AI-controlled, FFXIII's battles may be the most involving the series has ever seen.\" The story got a mixed reception, with \"Wired\" remarking that the plot was \"a little more human and less esoteric than in previous games\". 1UP.com felt that the story was \"hardly world-class writing\", but that the writers clearly knew the medium well and had attempted to avoid clichés. Reviewers felt that the characters worked well together, and that the interactions among them as the game progressed made up for shortcomings in the story.\n\nWhile critics generally praised Square Enix's attempt to revitalize the \"Final Fantasy\" series formula, many reacted negatively to the linear nature of the game, especially in the first ten chapters on Cocoon, an issue which many felt was compounded by the large reduction of towns, free-roaming capabilities, and interaction with non-player characters. \"GamePro\" described the gameplay as \"a long hallway toward an orange target symbol on your mini-map that triggers a cutscene, a boss fight, or both,\" and 1UP.com criticized the linear aspect as the game's \"biggest shortcoming\", and felt the first section was \"superficial.\" \"Edge\" and others awarded the game especially lower scores as a result of these aspects, with \"Edge\" in particular lowering the score they awarded the game to a five out of ten primarily due to the game's linear nature.\n\nIn contrast, reviewers from GamesRadar and \"Computer and Video Games\" appreciated the linear nature; the former stated that \"the streamlined, focused structure eliminates potential tedium without dumbing anything down\", while the latter felt it was \"a clever move\", and kept the player from being \"[bogged] down with mundane number crunching, [and] finicky and repetitive leveling-up.\" Many negatively noted the gradual unfurling of the player's abilities over this first part of the game, from battle gameplay to selecting the party leader. Combined with the game's linear nature, some reviews went as far as to describe these chapters as \"boring\" until the world of Gran Pulse was revealed. \"Edge\" noted that while it did not do enough to make up for the opening chapters, at Gran Pulse the game \"hits a sweet spot\" as the narrative offers \"hunting side-quests and the simple joy of exploring to see what visual marvel is around the next corner.\"\n\nAfter release, director Motomu Toriyama felt that the lower-than-expected review scores for a main \"Final Fantasy\" series game came from reviewers who approached the game from a Western point of view. These reviewers were used to games in which the player was given an open world to explore, he said, noting that this expectation contrasted with the vision the team set out to create. He noted that it \"becomes very difficult to tell a compelling story when you're given that much freedom\". Yoshinori Kitase stated that they \"didn't really intend to work within the RPG template,\" but \"wanted to create a new game, even a new genre.\" He stated that \"in a lot of senses FFXIII is more like an FPS than an RPG.\"\n\nToriyama and Kitase later said, in July 2011, that the biggest complaints about the game were that it was too linear and that there was not enough interaction between the player and the world, which they described as a lack of towns and minigames compared to the previous \"Final Fantasy\" games. They also named the amount of time it took to access all of the gameplay elements as a common criticism, saying that people interpreted it as a \"lengthy tutorial\".\n\nYoichi Wada, then-president of Square Enix, made his thoughts about the reception of the game known to Gamasutra. He said \"some value it highly and some are not very happy with it\". He added, \"Should \"Final Fantasy\" become a new type of game or should \"Final Fantasy\" not become a new type of game? The customers have different opinions. It's very difficult to determine which way it should go.\"\n\nSquare Enix released a Microsoft Windows port of the game in October 2014, where it was met with a more critical reception than the original versions. \"PC Gamer\"s Samuel Roberts, when reviewing the port, criticized not only the original gameplay, but heavily criticized the quality of the port itself, decrying the low resolution, limited graphical options and low framerate. He was especially critical of the time taken for the port given that an unofficial patch was produced by modder Peter Thoman within a day of release that fixed many of the issues. Michael McWhertor of Polygon also noted a similar critical response by consumers. A patch was released by Square Enix in December 2014, which was noted by Thoman as adding only the graphical features that his external patch had, with no other additions or performance improvements.\n\nAt the Square Enix First Production Department Conference held on January 18, 2011, Square Enix announced that they were developing a direct sequel to \"Final Fantasy XIII\", entitled \"Final Fantasy XIII-2\", which they intended to build on the game's story and characters while taking on board the criticism and other feedback about the original. It was released on December 15, 2011, in Japan, January 31, 2012, in North America and February 3, 2012, in Europe, for both the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360. Motomu Toriyama and Yoshinori Kitase returned to their respective roles as director and producer. The game begins three years after the events of \"Final Fantasy XIII\", and features Serah and newcomer Noel as the main protagonists. \"XIII-2\" is the fifth sequel game in the \"Final Fantasy\" series, after \"Final Fantasy X-2\", \"\", \"\", and \"\". Most of the team returned again to create a second sequel entitled \"\", meant to wrap up the story of Lightning and the \"Final Fantasy XIII\" universe. The game was released in November 2013 in Japan and in February 2014 in North America and Europe. Toriyama stated in the \"Ultimania Omega\" companion book prior to \"XIII-2\"s announcement that he hoped to write a story \"where Lightning ends up happy\", though at the time Square Enix had no plans to make a sequel.\n"}

The work, an immediate best seller that eventually encompassed seven chapters when a second volume was published in 1841, covers a wide range of local topics from the varieties of snow to the customs, lifestyles, local dialects, industries, and folk tales of Japan's snow country. The text covers 123 themes from multiple angles and is also richly illustrated with detailed sketches.\n\n—a gesaku writer and brother of Santō Kyōden—assisted with publication of the text. He wrote the preface and drew the illustrations, which were based on Bokushi's originals.\n\nSome of the material in the book is of scientific interest. For example, it contains \nthe first Japanese sketches of 86 types of natural snowflake crystals. An 1840 edition included an additional 97 sketches that Doi Toshitsura made with the aid of a microscope during his 20 years as daimyō of the Koga Domain. Thereafter, the snow crystal became a popular design motif on kimonos and on chawan, Japanese tea bowls.\n\n\n\n"}

The word \"song\" is widely misused by people in the popular music industry to describe any musical composition, whether sung or played only by instruments. The music is primarily or exclusively produced using musical instruments. An instrumental can exist in music notation, after it is written by a composer; in the mind of the composer (especially in cases where the composer himself will perform the piece, as in the case of a blues solo guitarist or a folk music fiddle player); as a piece that is performed live by a single instrumentalist or a musical ensemble, which could range in components from a duo or trio to a large Big Band, concert band or orchestra.\n\nIn a song that is otherwise sung, a section that is not sung but which is played by instruments can be called an instrumental interlude, or, if it occurs at the beginning of the song, before the singer starts to sing, an instrumental introduction. If the instrumental section highlights the skill, musicality, and often the virtuosity of a particular performer (or group of performers), the section may be called a \"solo\" (e.g., the guitar solo that is a key section of heavy metal music and hard rock songs). If the instruments are percussion instruments, the interlude can be called a percussion interlude or \"percussion break\". These interludes are a form of break in the song.\n\nModern instrumentals are produced using a digital audio workstation (DAW) such as FL Studio, Cubase and Logic Pro. These pieces of software allow instrumental music to be composed with ease.\n\nIn commercial popular music, instrumental tracks are sometimes renderings, remixes of a corresponding release that features vocals, but they may also be compositions originally conceived without vocals. One example of a genre in which both vocal/instrumental and solely instrumental songs are produced is blues. A blues band often uses mostly songs that have lyrics that are sung, but during the band's show, they may also perform instrumental songs which only include electric guitar, harmonica, upright bass/electric bass and drum kit.\n\nThe opposite of instrumental music, that is, music for voices alone, without any accompaniment instruments, is a cappella, an Italian phrase that means \"in the chapel\". In early music, instruments such as trumpet and drums were considered outdoor instruments, and music for inside a chapel typically used quieter instruments, voices, or just voices alone. A capella music exists in both Classical music choir pieces (for choir without any accompanist piano or pipe organ) and in popular music styles such as doo wop groups and Barbershop quartets. For genres in which a non-vocal song or interlude is conceived using computers and software, rather than with acoustic musical instruments or electronic musical instruments, the term instrumental is still used for it.\n\nSome recordings which include brief or non-musical use of the human voice are typically considered instrumentals. Examples include songs with the following:\n\nSongs including actual musical—rhythmic, melodic, and lyrical—vocals might still be categorized as instrumentals if the vocals appear only as a short part of an extended piece (e.g., \"Unchained Melody\" (Les Baxter), \"TSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia)\", \"Pick Up the Pieces\", \"The Hustle\", \"Fly, Robin, Fly\", \"Get Up and Boogie\", \"Do It Any Way You Wanna\", and \"Gonna Fly Now\"), though this definition is loose and subjective.\n\nFalling just outside of that definition is \"Theme From Shaft\" by Isaac Hayes.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7765099", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7765099", "title": "Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy", "text": "Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy\n\nThe \"Jyllands-Posten\" Muhammad cartoons controversy (or Muhammad cartoons crisis) (Danish: \"Muhammedkrisen\") began after the Danish newspaper \"Jyllands-Posten\" published 12 editorial cartoons on 30 September 2005, most of which depicted Muhammad, a principal figure of the religion of Islam. The newspaper announced that this was an attempt to contribute to the debate about criticism of Islam and self-censorship. Muslim groups in Denmark complained, and the issue eventually led to protests around the world, including violent demonstrations and riots in some Muslim countries.\n\nIslam has a strong tradition of aniconism, and it is considered highly blasphemous in most Islamic traditions to visually depict Muhammad. This, compounded with a sense that the cartoons insulted Muhammad and Islam, offended many Muslims. Danish Muslim organisations that objected to the depictions responded by petitioning the embassies of Islamic countries and the Danish government to take action in response, and filed a judicial complaint against the newspaper, which was dismissed in January 2006. After the Danish government refused to meet with diplomatic representatives of the Muslim countries and would not intervene in the case, a number of Danish imams visited the Middle East in late 2005 to raise awareness of the issue. They presented a dossier containing the twelve cartoons from the \"Jyllands-Posten\", and other information some of which was found to be falsified.\n\nAs a result, the issue received prominent media attention in some Muslim-majority countries, leading to protests across the world in late January and early February 2006. Some escalated into violence resulting in more than 200 reported deaths, attacks on Danish and other European diplomatic missions, attacks on churches and Christians, and a major international boycott. Some groups responded to the outpouring of protest by endorsing the Danish policies, launching \"Buy Danish\" campaigns and other displays of support. The cartoons were reprinted in newspapers around the world both in a sense of journalistic solidarity and as an illustration in what became a major news story.\n\nDanish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen described the controversy as Denmark's worst international relations incident since the Second World War. The incident came at a time of heightened political and social tensions between Muslim majority countries and Western countries, following several, high-profile Islamic terrorist attacks in the Westincluding the September 11 attacksand Western military interventions in Muslim countries, such as Iraq and Afghanistan. The cartoons and the reaction to them aggravated already-strained relations. The relationship between Muslims in Denmark and the broader society was similarly at a low-point, and the conflict came to symbolize the misunderstandings between the Islamic community and the rest of society. In the years since, terrorist plots claiming to be in retaliation for the cartoons have been planned, and some executed, against targets affiliated with newspapers that published the cartoons or Denmark.\n\nSupporters said that the publication of the cartoons was a legitimate exercise of free speech regardless of the validity of the expression, that it was important to openly discuss Islam without fear or that the cartoons made important points about topical issues. The Danish tradition of relatively high tolerance for freedom of speech became a focus of some attention. The controversy ignited a debate about the limits of freedom of expression in all societies, religious tolerance and the relationship of Muslim minorities with their broader societies in the West, and relations between the Islamic World in general and the West. Critics of the cartoons described them as Islamophobic, racist, or baiting and blasphemous to Muslims, possibly intended to humiliate a Danish minority. Others saw them as a manifestation of ignorance about the history of Western imperialism, double standards, and stereotyping.\n\nOn 16 September 2005, Danish news service Ritzau published an article discussing the difficulty encountered by the writer Kåre Bluitgen, who was initially unable to find an illustrator prepared to work on his children's book \"The Qur'an and the life of the Prophet Muhammad\" (Danish:\"Koranen og profeten Muhammeds liv\"). Three artists declined Bluitgen's proposal out of fear of reprisals.\n\nOne artist agreed to assist anonymously; he said that he was afraid for his and his family's safety. According to Bluitgen, one artist declined due to the murder in Amsterdam of the film director Theo van Gogh the year before; another cited the attack in October 2004 on a lecturer at the Carsten Niebuhr Institute at the University of Copenhagen; he was assaulted by five assailants who opposed his reading of the Qur'an to non-Muslims during a lecture. The story gained some traction, and the major Danish newspapers reported the story the following day.\n\nThe supposed refusals from these first three artists to participate was seen as evidence of self-censorship out of fear of violence from Islamists, which led to much debate in Denmark. The Danish news paper Politiken stated at February 12, 2006, that they asked Bluitgen to put them in touch with the artists, so the claim that none of them dared to work with him could be proved. The author refused, and nobody has ever been able to confirm whether the incident is properly described.\n\nAt an editorial meeting of \"Jyllands-Posten\" (\"The Jutland Post\", Denmark's largest daily newspaper) on 19 September, reporter Stig Olesen mooted the idea of asking the members of the newspaper illustrators union if they would be willing to draw Muhammad. This would be an experiment to see the degree to which professional illustrators felt threatened. Flemming Rose, culture editor, was interested in the idea and wrote to the 42 members of the union asking them to draw their interpretations of Muhammad.\n\n15 illustrators responded to the letter; three declined to participate, one did not know how to contribute to what he called a vague project, one thought the project was stupid and badly paid, and one said he was afraid. 12 drawings had been submittedthree from newspaper employees and two which did not directly show Muhammad. The editors thought that some of the illustrators who had not responded were employed by other newspapers and were thus contractually prohibited from working for \"Jyllands-Posten.\" In the end, editor-in-chief Carsten Juste decided that given its inconclusive results, the story was better suited as an opinion piece rather than a news story, and it was decided to publish it in the culture section, entirely under the direction of editor Flemming Rose.\n\nPeter Hervik, a professor of Migration Studies, has since written that the results of this experiment disproved the idea that self-censorship was a serious problem in Denmark because the overwhelming majority of cartoonists had either responded positively or refused for contractual or philosophical reasons. Carsten Juste has said that the survey \"lacked validity and the story fell short of sound journalistic basis.\" Hervik said that this, along with the fact that the most controversial cartoons were drawn by the newspaper's staff cartoonists, demonstrates that the newspaper's \"desire to provoke and insult Danish Muslims exceeded the wish to test the self-censorship of Danish cartoonists.\"\n\nRose wrote the editorial which accompanied the cartoons in which he argued there had been several recent cases of self-censorship, weighing freedom of speech against the fear of confronting issues about Islam, so he thought it was legitimate news story. Among the incidents he cited were: the translators of a book critical of Islam did not want their names published; the Tate gallery in London withdrew an installation by the avant-garde artist John Latham depicting the Quran, Bible and Talmud torn to pieces, and comedian Frank Hvam said in an interview with \"Jyllands-Posten\" that he would hypothetically dare to urinate on the Bible on television, but not on the Quran. Rose also mentioned the case of a Danish imam who had met with Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen and \"called on the prime minister to interfere with the press in order to get more positive coverage of Islam.\"\n\nOn 30 September 2005, \"Jyllands-Posten\" published an article entitled \"Muhammeds ansigt\" (\"The face of Muhammad\") incorporating the cartoons. The article consisted of the 12 cartoons and an explanatory text, in which Rose wrote:\n\nLater, Rose explained his intent further in \"The Washington Post\": \"The cartoonists treated Islam the same way they treat Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism and other religions. And by treating Muslims in Denmark as equals they made a point: We are integrating you into the Danish tradition of satire because you are part of our society, not strangers. The cartoons are including, rather than excluding, Muslims.\" The publication of the cartoons was also accompanied by an editorial titled 'Truslen fra mørket\" ('The Threat from the Darkness\") condemning Islamic spiritual leaders \"who feel entitled to interpret the prophet's word, and cannot abide the insult that comes from being the object of intelligent satire.\" In October 2005, \"Politiken\", another leading Danish newspaper, published its own poll of thirty-one of the forty-three members of the Danish cartoonist association. Twenty-three said they would be willing to draw Muhammad. One had doubts, one would not be willing because of fear of possible reprisals, and six artists would not be willing because they respected the Muslim ban on depicting Muhammad.\n\nThe 12 cartoons were drawn by 12 professional cartoonists in Denmark. Four of the cartoons have Danish texts, one deliberately evades the issue and depicts a school child in Denmark named Muhammad rather than the Islamic prophet, one is based on a Danish cultural expression, and one includes a Danish politician.\n\nThe immediate responses to the publication included newspaper sellers refusing to distribute that day's paper. In the following days, the cartoons received significant attention in other Danish press outlets. According to Jytte Klausen, \"most people groaned that the newspaper was at it again, bashing Muslims. The instinct was to split the blame.\" \"Berlingske-Tidende\" criticised the 'gag', but also said that Islam should be openly criticised. \"Politiken\" attacked Rose's account of growing self-censorship; it also surveyed Danish cartoonists and said that self-censorship was not generally perceived as a problem. On October 4, a local teenager telephoned the newspaper offices threatening to kill the cartoonists, but he was arrested after his mother turned him in.\n\nShortly after the publication, a group of Islamic leaders formed a protest group. Raed Hlayhel called a meeting to discuss their strategy, which took place in Copenhagen a few days after the cartoons appeared. The Islamic Faith Community and four mosques from around the country were represented. The meeting established 19 \"action points\" to try to influence public opinion about the cartoons. Ahmed Akkari from an mosque in Aarhus was designated the group's spokesman. The group planned a variety of political activities, including launching a legal complaint against the newspaper, writing letters to media outlets inside and outside Denmark, contacting politicians and diplomatic representatives, organising a protest in Copenhagen, and mobilising Danish Muslims through text messages and mosques. A one-day strike and sleep-in were planned, but never took place. A peaceful protest, which attracted about 3,500 demonstrators, was held in Copenhagen on 14 October 2005.\n\nHaving received petitions from Danish imams, eleven ambassadors from Muslim-majority countriesTurkey, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Pakistan, Egypt, Indonesia, Algeria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Libya, Moroccoand the Head of the Palestinian General Delegation asked for a meeting with Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen on 12 October 2005. They wanted to discuss what they perceived as an \"on-going smearing campaign in Danish public circles and media against Islam and Muslims\". In a letter, the ambassadors mentioned the issue of the Muhammad cartoons, a recent indictment against Radio Holger, and statements by MP Louise Frevert and the Minister of Culture Brian Mikkelsen. It concluded:\n\nThe government answered with a letter without addressing the request for a meeting: \"The freedom of expression has a wide scope and the Danish government has no means of influencing the press. However, Danish legislation prohibits acts or expressions of blasphemous or discriminatory nature. The offended party may bring such acts or expressions to court, and it is for the courts to decide in individual cases.\"\n\nThe refusal to meet the ambassadors was later prominently criticised by the Danish political opposition, twenty-two Danish ex-ambassadors and the Prime Minister's fellow party member, former Minister of Foreign Affairs Uffe Ellemann-Jensen. Hervik wrote, \"While it is certainly true that the prime minister did not have a legal right to intervene in the editorial process, he could have publicly (as an enactment of free speech) dissociated himself from the publication, from the content of the cartoons, from Rose's explanatory text, from \"Jyllands-Posten\"'s editorial of the same day, and from the general association of Islam with terrorism. Rasmussen did none of those. Instead, he used his interview [on 30 October 2005] to endorse \"Jyllands-Posten's\" position and the act of publishing the cartoons.\"\n\nThe Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and Arab League also wrote a joint letter to the Prime Minister expressing alarm about the cartoons and other recent incidents and insults committed by Danish politicians. The Muslim countries continued to work diplomatically to try to have the issueand the other issues mentioned in their initial letteraddressed by the Danish government. Turkey and Egypt were particularly active. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan visited Copenhagen in November in an encounter which the Turkish press described as a crisis. Erdogan clashed with Rasmussen over the cartoons as well as Roj TVa television station affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers' Partybeing allowed to broadcast from Denmark. After trying to engage the Danish government diplomatically, Egyptian foreign minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit and the secretary-generals of the OIC and the Arab League sent letters to the OSCE, OECD, and EU foreign policy coordinator complaining about Danish inaction.\n\nOn 27 October 2005, representatives of the Muslim organisations which had complained about the cartoons in early October filed a complaint with the Danish police claiming that \"Jyllands-Posten\" had committed an offence under section 140 and 266b of the Danish Criminal Code, precipitating an investigation by the public prosecutor.\n\nOn 6 January 2006, the Regional Public Prosecutor in Viborg discontinued the investigation as he found no basis for concluding that the cartoons constituted a criminal offence because the publication concerned a subject of public interest and Danish case law extends editorial freedom to journalists regarding subjects of public interest. He stated that in assessing what constitutes an offence, the right to freedom of speech must be taken into consideration, and said that freedom of speech must be exercised with the necessary respect for other human rights, including the right to protection against discrimination, insult and degradation. In a new hearing resulting from a complaint about the original decision, the Director of Public Prosecutors in Denmark agreed with the previous ruling.\n\nIn December, after failing to make any progress with the Danish government or the newspaper, the \"Committee for Prophet Honouring\" decided to gain support and leverage outside of Denmark by meeting directly with religious and political leaders in the Middle East. They created a 43-page dossier (commonly known as the Akkari-Laban dossier, after two leading imams ()) containing the cartoons and supporting materials for their meetings.\n\nThe dossier, finalised for the group's trip to Lebanon in mid-December, contained the following:\n\n\nThe dossier also contained \"falsehood about alleged maltreatment of Muslims in Denmark\" and the \"tendentious lie that \"Jyllands-Posten\" was a government-run newspaper\".\n\nThe imams said that the three additional images were sent anonymously by mail to Muslims who were participating in an online debate on \"Jyllands-Posten\"s website, and were apparently included to illustrate the perceived atmosphere of Islamophobia in which they lived. On 1 February, BBC World incorrectly reported that one of the images had been published in \"Jyllands-Posten\". This image was later found to be a wire-service photograph of a contestant at a French pig-squealing contest in the Trie-sur-Baise's annual festival. One of the other two additional images (a photograph) portrayed a Muslim being mounted by a dog while praying, and the other (a cartoon) portrayed Muhammad as a demonic paedophile.\n\nExpertsincluding Helle Lykke Nielsenwho have examined the dossier said that it was broadly accurate from a technical point of view but contained a few falsehoods and could easily have misled people not familiar with Danish society, an assessment which the imams have since agreed to. Some mistakes were that Islam is not officially recognised as a religion in Denmark (it is), that the cartoons are the result of a contest, and that Anders Fogh Rasmussen in his role as Prime Minister gave a medal to Ayaan Hirsi Ali (he gave one in his capacity as party leader of the Liberal Party). The imams also claimed to speak on behalf of 28 organisations, many of which later denied any connection to them. Additions such as the \"pig\" photograph may have polarised the situation (the association of a person and a pig is considered very insulting in Islamic culture), as they were confused for the cartoons published in the newspaper. Muslims who met with the group later said Akkari's delegation had given them the impression that Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen somehow controlled or owned \"Jyllands-Posten\".\n\nDelegations of imams circulated the dossier on visits to Egypt, Syria and Lebanon in early December 2005, presenting their case to many influential religious and political leaders and asking for support. The group was given high level access on these trips through their contacts in the Egyptian and Lebanese embassies. The dossier was distributed informally on 7–8 December 2005 at a summit of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference in Mecca, with many heads of state in attendance. The OIC issued a condemnation of the cartoons: \"[We express our] concern at rising hatred against Islam and Muslims and condemned the recent incident of desecration of the image of the Holy Prophet Mohamed.\" The communique also attacked the practice of \"using the freedom of expression as a pretext for defaming religions.\" Eventually an official communiqué was issued requesting that the United Nations adopt a binding resolution banning contempt of religious beliefs and providing for sanctions to be imposed on contravening countries or institutions. The attention of the OIC is said to have led to media coverage which brought the issue to public attention in many Muslim countries.\n\nProtests against the cartoons were held around the world in late January and February 2006. Many of these turned violent, resulting in at least 200 deaths globally, according to the \"New York Times\". Large demonstrations were held in many majority-Muslim countries, and almost every country with significant Muslim minorities, including Nigeria, Canada, India, the United States, the United Kingdom (see: 2006 Islamist demonstration outside the Embassy of Denmark in London), Australia, New Zealand, Kenya, and throughout continental Europe. In many instances, demonstrations against the cartoons became intertwined with those about other local political grievances. Muslims in the north of Nigeria used protests to attack local Christians as part of an ongoing battle for influence, radical Sunnis used protests against governments in the Middle East, and authoritarian governments used them to bolster their religious and nationalist credentials in internal disputes; these associated political motives explain the intensity of some of the demonstrations.\n\nSeveral Western embassies were attacked; the Danish and Austrian embassies in Lebanon and the Norwegian and Danish representations in Syria were severely damaged. Christians and Christian churches were also targets of violent retribution in some places. Condoleezza Rice, Secretary of State of the United States, accused Iran and Syria of organising many of the protests in Iran, Syria and Lebanon. However, Hezbollah, ally of Syria and Iran in Lebanon, has condemned the attack on the Danish Embassy. Several death threats were made against the cartoonists and the newspaper, resulting in the cartoonists' going into hiding. Danish Prime Minister Rasmussen called it Denmark's worst international relations incident since the Second World War.\n\nPeaceful counter-demonstrations in support of the cartoons, Denmark, and freedom of speech were also held. Three national ministers lost their jobs amid the controversy: Roberto Calderoli in Italy for his support of the cartoons, Laila Freivalds in Sweden for her role in shutting down a website displaying the cartoons, and the Libyan Interior Minister after a riot in Benghazi in response to Calderoli's comments, which led to the deaths of at least 10 people. In India, Haji Yaqoob Qureishi, a minister in the Uttar Pradesh state government, announced a cash reward for anyone who beheaded \"the Danish cartoonist\" who caricatured Mohammad. Subsequently, a case was filed against him in the Lucknow district court and eminent Muslim scholars in India were split between those supporting punishment for the cartoonists and those calling for the minister's sacking. As of 2011, legal action was ongoing.\n\nA consumer boycott was organised in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and other Middle Eastern countries against Denmark. On 5 March 2006, Ayman al-Zawahiri of Al-Qaeda urged all Muslims to boycott not only Denmark, but also Norway, France, Germany and all others that have \"insulted the Prophet Mohammed\" by printing cartoons depicting him. Consumer goods companies were the most vulnerable to the boycott; among companies heavily affected were Arla Foods, Novo Nordisk, and Danisco. Arla, Denmark's biggest exporter to the Middle East, lost 10 million kroner (1.6 million US dollars, 1.3 million euros) per day in the initial weeks of the boycott. Scandinavian tourism to Egypt fell by between 20–30% in the first two months of 2006.\n\nOn 9 September 2006, BBC News reported that the Muslim boycott of Danish goods had reduced Denmark's total exports by 15.5% between February and June. This was attributed to an approximated 50% decline in exports to the Middle East. The BBC said, \"The cost to Danish businesses was around 134 million euros ($170m), when compared with the same period last year, the statistics showed.\" However, \"The Guardian\" newspaper in the UK said, \"While Danish milk products were dumped in the Middle East, fervent right-wing Americans started buying Bang & Olufsen stereos and Lego. In the first quarter of this year Denmark's exports to the US soared 17%.\" Overall the boycott did not have a significant effect on the Danish economy.\n\nIn response to the initial protests from Muslim groups, \"Jyllands-Posten\" published an open letter to the citizens of Saudi Arabia on its website, in Danish and in Arabic, apologising for any offence the drawings may have caused but defending the right of the newspaper to publish them. A second open letter \"to the honourable Fellow Citizens of the Muslim World\", dated 8 February 2006, had a Danish version, an Arabic version, and an English version. It said, \n\nSix of the cartoons were first reprinted by the Egyptian newspaper \"El Fagr\" on 17 October 2005, along with an article strongly denouncing them, but this did not provoke any condemnations or other reactions from religious or government authorities. Between October 2005 and early January 2006, examples of the cartoons were reprinted in major European newspapers from the Netherlands, Germany, Scandinavia, Romania, and Switzerland. After the beginning of major international protests, they were re-published around the globe, but primarily in continental Europe. The cartoons were not reprinted in any major newspapers in Canada, the United Kingdom, or many in the United States where articles covered the story without including them.\n\nReasons for the decision not to publish the cartoons widely in the United Statesdespite that country's permissive free speech lawsincluded increased religious sensitivity, higher integration of Muslims into mainstream society, and a desire to be tactful considering the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nNumerous newspapers were closed and editors dismissed, censured, or arrested for their decision or intention to re-publish the cartoons. In some countries, including South Africa, publication of the cartoons was banned by government or court orders.\n\nThe OIC denounced calls for the death of the Danish cartoonists. The OIC's Secretary General Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu said at the height of crisis that the violent protests were \"un-Islamic\" and appealed for calm. He also denounced calls for a boycott of Danish goods. Twelve high-profile writers, among them Salman Rushdie, signed a letter called \"Manifesto: Together Facing the New Totalitarianism\" which was published in a number of newspapers. It said that the violence sparked by the publication of cartoons satirising Muhammad \"shows the need to fight for secular values and freedom.\"\n\nNumerous violent plots related to the cartoons have been discovered in the years since the main protests in early 2006. These have primarily targeted editor Flemming Rose, cartoonist Kurt Westergaard, the property or employees of \"Jyllands-Posten\" and other newspapers that printed the cartoons, and representatives of the Danish state. Westergaard has been the subject of several attacks or planned attacks and now lives under special police protection. On 1 January 2010, police used firearms to stop a would-be assassin in Westergaard's home. In February 2011, the attacker, a 29-year-old Somalian man, was sentenced to nine years in prison. In 2010, three men based in Norway were arrested on suspicion that they were planning a terror attack against \"Jyllands-Posten\" or Kurt Westergaard; two of the men were convicted. In the United States, David Headley and Tahawwur Hussain Rana were convicted of planning terrorism against \"Jyllands-Posten\" and were sentenced in 2013.\n\nNaser Khader, a Muslim Danish MP, founded an organisation called Democratic Muslims in Denmark in response to the controversy. He was worried that what he believed to be Islamists were seen to speak for all Muslims in Denmark. He said that there is still a sharp division within the Danish Muslim community between Islamists and moderates, and that Denmark had become a target for Islamists. He said that some good came from the crisis because \"the cartoon crisis made clear that Muslims are not united and that there is a real difference between the Islamists and people like myself. Danes were shown that talk of 'the Muslims' was too monolithic.\" He also said that the crisis served as a wake-up call about radical Islam to European countries.\n\nIn 2009, when Brandeis professor Jytte Klausen wanted to publish a book about the controversy titled \"The Cartoons that Shook the World\", Yale University Press refused to publish the cartoons and other representations of Muhammad out of fear for the safety of its staff. In response, another company published \"\" in what it called \"a 'picture book'or errata to the bowdlerized version of Klausen's book.\" Five years to the day after the cartoons were first published in \"Jyllands-Posten,\" they were republished in Denmark in Rose's book \"Tyranny of Silence.\" When the book's international edition was published in the United States in 2014 it did not include the cartoons.\n\nIn 2013, The Islamic Society in Denmark stated that they regretted their visit to Lebanon and Egypt in 2006 to show the caricatures because the consequences had been much more serious than they expected. In August 2013, Ahmed Akkari expressed his regret for his role in the Imams' tour of the Middle East, stating \"I want to be clear today about the trip: It was totally wrong. At that time, I was so fascinated with this logical force in the Islamic mindset that I could not see the greater picture. I was convinced it was a fight for my faith, Islam.\" Still a practising Muslim, he said that printing the cartoons was ok and he personally apologised to the cartoonist Westergaard. Westergaard responded by saying \"I met a man who has converted from being an Islamist to become a humanist who understands the values of our society. To me, he is really sincere, convincing and strong in his views.\" A spokesman for the Islamic Society of Denmark said \"It is still not OK to publish drawings of Muhammad. We have not changed our position.\"\n\nThe French satirical weekly newspaper \"Charlie Hebdo\" was taken to court for publishing the cartoons; it was acquitted of charges that it incited hatred. The incident marked the beginning of a number of violent incidents related to the cartoons of Muhammad at the newspaper over the following decade.\n\nOn 2 November 2011, \"Charlie Hebdo\" was firebombed right before its 3 November issue was due; the issue was called \"Charia Hebdo\" and satirically featured Muhammad as guest-editor. The editor, Stéphane Charbonnier, known as Charb, and two co-workers at \"Charlie Hebdo\" subsequently received police protection. Charb was placed on a hit list by Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula along with Kurt Westergaard, Lars Vilks, Carsten Juste and Flemming Rose after editing an edition of \"Charlie Hebdo\" that satirised Muhammad.\n\nOn 7 January 2015, two masked gunmen opened fire on Charlie Hebdos staff and police officers as vengeance for its continued caricatures of Muhammad, killing 12 people, including Charb, and wounding 11 others. \"Jyllands-Posten\" did not re-print the \"Charlie Hebdo\" cartoons in the wake of the attack, with the new editor-in-chief citing security concerns.\n\nIn February 2015, in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo shootings in Paris, a gunman opened fire on attendants and police officers at a meeting discussing freedom of speech with the Swedish cartoonist Lars Vilks among the panelists, and later attacked a synagogue killing two people in Copenhagen in the 2015 Copenhagen shootings.\n\nFreedom of speech was guaranteed in law by the Danish Constitution of 1849, as it is today by The Constitutional Act of Denmark of 5 June 1953. Danish freedom of expression is quite far-reachingeven by Western European standardsalthough it is subject to some legal restrictions dealing with libel, hate speech, blasphemy and defamation. The country's comparatively lenient attitude toward freedom of expression has provoked official protests from several foreign governments, for example Germany, Turkey and Russia for allowing controversial organisations to use Denmark as a base for their operations. Reporters Without Borders ranked Denmark at the top of its Worldwide Press Freedom Index for 2005. Danish newspapers are privately owned and independent from the government.\n\nAt the time, section 140 of the Danish Penal Code criminalized mocking or insulting legal religions and faiths. No-one had been charged under section 140 since 1971 and no-one had been convicted since 1938. A complaint was filed against \"Jyllands-Posten\" under this section of the law, but the Regional Public Prosecutor declined to file charges, stating \"that in assessing what constitutes an offence under both section 140 and section 266 b [discussed below] of the Danish Criminal Code, the right to freedom of expression must be taken into consideration\"; he found that no criminal offence had taken place in this case. Section 140 was repealed in 2017.\n\nHowever, the Director of Public Prosecutions said, \"there is, therefore, no free and unrestricted right to express opinions about religious subjects. It is thus not a correct description of existing law when the article in \"Jyllands-Posten\" states that it is incompatible with the right to freedom of expression to demand special consideration for religious feelings and that one has to be ready to put up with 'scorn, mockery and ridicule'.\" Utterances intended for public dissemination deemed hateful based on 'race, colour, national or ethnic origin, belief or sexual orientation' can be penalised under section 266 b of the criminal code. Some people have been convicted under this provision, mostly for speech directed at Muslims.\n\nWhile \"Jyllands-Posten\" has published satirical cartoons depicting Christian figures, it rejected unsolicited cartoons in 2003 which depicted Jesus on the grounds that they were offensive, opening it to accusations of a double standard. In February 2006, \"Jyllands-Posten\" refused to publish Holocaust cartoons, which included cartoons that mocked or denied the Holocaust, offered by an Iranian newspaper which had held a contest. Six of the less controversial images were later published by \"Dagbladet Information\", after the editors consulted the main rabbi in Copenhagen, and three cartoons were later reprinted in \"Jyllands-Posten\". After the competition had finished, \"Jyllands-Posten\" also reprinted the winning and runner-up cartoons.\n\n\"Jyllands-Posten\" has been described as conservative and it was supportive of the then-ruling party Venstre. It frequently reported on the activities of imams it considered radical, including Raed Hlayhel and Ahmed Akkari. Peter Hervik has argued that anti-Islamic positions and discourse dominated \"Jyllands-Posten's\" editorial leadership from at least 2001 until the cartoon crisis.\n\nThe Qur'an condemns idolatry, and this has led some Islamic scholars to interpret it as prohibiting figurative representation; this is known as aniconism. However, since Islam has many centres of religious authority, opinion and tradition about this is not uniform. In popular practice today there is no general injunction against pictorial representation of people outside of religious contexts. Generally, images of Muhammad have been prohibited throughout history. In practice, images of Muhammad have been made on many occasions, generally in a restricted and socially regulated way; for example, they are often stylised or do not show Muhammad's face. Within Muslim communities, views about pictorial representations have varied: Shi'a Islam has been generally tolerant of pictorial representations of human figures while Sunni Islam generally forbids any pictorial representation of living beings, albeit with some variation in practice outside a religious context. Some contemporary interpretations of Islam, such as those followed by adherents of Wahhabism, are entirely aniconistic and condemn pictorial representations of any kind.\n\nIn Muslim societies, insulting Muhammad is considered one of the gravest of all crimes. According to Ana Belen Soage of the University of Granada, \"The Islamic sharî'a has traditionally considered blasphemy punishable by death, although modern Muslim thinkers such as Mohammad Hashim Kamali maintain that, given that the Quran does not prescribe a punishment, determining a penalty is left to the judicial authorities of the day.\" In the Quran itself, \"God often instructs Muhammad to be patient to those who insult him and, according to historical records, no action was taken against them during his years in Mecca.\" Many Muslims said their anti-cartoon stance is against insulting pictures and not so much as against pictures in general. According to the BBC, \"It is the satirical intent of the cartoonists and the association of the Prophet with terrorism, that is so offensive to the vast majority of Muslims.\" This link played into a widespread perception among Muslims across the world that many in the West are hostile towards Islam and Muslims.\n\nThe cartoon controversy became one of the highest profile world events in 2006. It attracted a great deal of coverage and commentary, mostly focusing on the situation of Muslims living in the West, the relationship between the Western world and Islamic world, and issues surrounding freedom of speech, secularism, and self-censorship.\n\nApproximately 350,000 non-Western immigrants lived in Denmark in 2006, representing about 7% of the country's population. According to figures reported by the BBC, about 270,000 of these were Muslim (ca. 5% of the population). In the 1970s Muslims arrived from Turkey, Pakistan, Morocco and Yugoslavia to work. In the 1980s and 90s most Muslim arrivals were refugees and asylum seekers from Iran, Iraq, Somalia and Bosnia. Muslims are the second-largest religious group in Denmark behind Lutherans.\n\nPeter Hervik said that the cartoon controversy must be seen in the context of an increasingly politicised media environment in Denmark since the 1990s, increasingly negative coverage of Islam and the Muslim minority in Denmark, anti-Muslim rhetoric from the governing political parties, and government policies such as restrictions on immigration and the abolishment of the Board for Ethnic Equality in 2002. Hervik said these themes are often ignored in international coverage of the issue and that they render conclusions that \"Jyllands-Posten\" and the Danish government were innocent victims in a dispute over freedom of speech inaccurate. Against this background, Danish Muslims were particularly offended by the cartoons because they reinforced the idea that Danes stigmatize all Muslims as terrorists and do not respect their religious beliefs.\n\nHeiko Henkel of British academic journal \"Radical Philosophy\" wrote: \n\nKiku Day, writing in the Guardian said, \"We were a liberal and tolerant people until the 1990s, when we suddenly awoke to find that for the first time in our history we had a significant minority group living among us. Confronted with the terrifying novelty of being a multicultural country, Denmark took a step not merely to the right but to the far right.\" Professor Anders Linde-Laursen wrote that while the controversy \"should be understood as an expression of a growing Islamophobic tendency in Danish society,\" this is just latest manifestation of a long-standing, and particularly deep conflict between traditionalists and agents of modernity in Denmark, and should not be seen as a major departure for Danish society.\n\nDanish Muslim politician Naser Khader said, \"Muslims are no more discriminated against in Denmark than they are elsewhere in Europe ... Generally, Danes give you a fair shake. They accept Muslims if you declare that you are loyal to this society, to democracy. If you say that you are one of them, they will accept you. If you have reservations, they will worry.\" His concern has centred on the power of \"Islamism\" or fundamentalist political Islam in Denmark's Muslim community which he has tried to fight, especially in the wake of the controversy by forming an association of democratic, moderate Muslims.\n\nThe incident occurred at a time of unusually strained relations between the Muslim world and the West. This was a result of decades of Muslim immigration to Europe, recent political struggles, violent incidents such as September 11 and a string of Islamist terrorist attacks and Western interventions in Muslim countries. The cartoons were used as a tool by different political interests in a wide variety of local and international situations. Some debate surrounded the relationship between Islamic minorities and their broader societies, and the legal and moral limits that the press should observe when commenting on that minority or any religious minority group.\n\nSome commentators see the publications of the cartoons as part of a deliberate effort to show Muslims and Islam in a bad light, thus influencing public opinion in the West in aid of various political projects. Journalist Andrew Mueller wrote, \"I am concerned that the ridiculous, disproportionate reaction to some unfunny sketches in an obscure Scandinavian newspaper may confirm that ... Islam and the West are fundamentally irreconcilable\". Different groups used the cartoon for different political purposes; Heiko Henkel wrote: \n\nSome commentators believed that the controversy was used by Islamists competing for influence both in Europe and the Islamic world. Jytte Klausen wrote that the Muslim reaction to the cartoons was not a spontaneous, emotional reaction arising out of the clash of Western and Islamic civilisations. \"Rather it was orchestrated, first by those with vested interests in elections in Denmark and Egypt, and later by Islamic extremists seeking to destabilise governments in Pakistan, Lebanon, Libya, and Nigeria.\" Other regimes in the Middle East have been accused of taking advantage of the controversy and adding to it to demonstrate their Islamic credentials, distracting from their domestic situations by setting up an external enemy, and according to \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"[using] the cartoons ... as a way of showing that the expansion of freedom and democracy in their countries would lead inevitably to the denigration of Islam.\"\n\nAmong others, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei blamed a Zionist conspiracy for the row over the cartoons. Palestinian Christian diplomat Afif Safieh, then the Palestine Liberation Organization's envoy to Washington, alleged the Likud party concocted the distribution of Muhammad caricatures worldwide in a bid to create a clash between the West and the Muslim world.\n\nOne controversy that arose around the cartoons was the question of whether they were racist. The United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR) Special Rapporteur \"on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance\", Doudou Diène, saw xenophobia and racism in Europe as the root of the controversy, and partly criticised the government of Denmark for inaction after the publication of the cartoons.\n\nHowever, Aurel Sari has since said that the special rapporteur's interpretation was wrong and that \"neither the decision to commission images depicting the Prophet in defiance of Islamic tradition, nor the actual content of the individual cartoons can be regarded as racist within the meaning of the relevant international human rights instruments\" although \"some of the more controversial pictures may nevertheless be judged 'gratuitously offensive' to the religious beliefs of Muslims in accordance with the applicable case-law of the European Court of Human Rights.\" This means that the Danish authorities probably could have prohibited the drawings' dissemination if they had chosen to. Randall Hansen said that the cartoons were clearly anti-Islamic, but that this should not be confused with racism because a religion is a system of ideas not an inherent identity. Tariq Modood said that the cartoons were essentially racist because Muslims are in practice treated as a group based on their religion, and that the cartoons were intended to represent all of Islam and all Muslims in a negative way, not just Muhammad. Erik Bleich said that while the cartoons did essentialise Islam in a potentially racist way, they ranged from offensive to pro-Muslim so labelling them as a group was problematic. \"The Economist\" said Muslims were not targeted in a discriminatory way, since unflattering cartoons about other religions or their leaders are frequently printed. Noam Chomsky posited that the cartoons were inspired by a spirit of \"ordinary racism under cover of freedom of expression\" and that they must be seen in the context of Jyllands-Posten agenda of incitement against immigrants in Denmark.\n\nOn 26 February 2006, the cartoonist Kurt Westergaard who drew the \"bomb in turban\" cartoonthe most controversial of the 12said:\n\nMany Muslims saw the cartoons as a sign of lack of education about Islam in Denmark and in the West. Egyptian preacher and television star Amr Khaled urged his followers to take action to remedy supposed Western ignorance, saying, \"It is our duty to the prophet of God to make his message known ... Do not say that this is the task of the \"ulema\" (religious scholars)it is the task of all of us.\" Ana Soage said, \"the targeting of a religious symbol like Muhammad, the only prophet that Muslims do not share with Jews and Christians, was perceived as the last in a long list of humiliations and assaults: it is probably not a coincidence that the more violent demonstrations were held in countries like Syria, Iran and Libya, whose relations with the West are tense.\" Yusuf al-Qaradawi, a prominent Islamic theologian, called for a day of anger from Muslims in response to the cartoons. He supported calls for a UN resolution that \"categorically prohibits affronts to prophetsto the prophets of the Lord and His messengers, to His holy books, and to the religious holy places\". He also castigated governments around the world for inaction on the issue, saying, \"Your silence over such crimes, which offend the Prophet of Islam and insult his great nation, is what begets violence, generates terrorism, and makes the terrorists say: Our governments are doing nothing, and we must avenge our Prophet ourselves. This is what creates terrorism and begets violence.\"\n\nEhsan Ahrari of \"Asia Times\" accused some European countries of double standards in adopting laws that outlaw Holocaust denial but still defended the concept of freedom of speech in this case. Anti-holocaust or genocide denial laws were in place in Austria, Germany, Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Israel, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, and Romania in 2005. However, Denmark has no such laws and there wasand still isno EU-wide law against holocaust denial. Randall Hansen said that laws against holocaust denial were not directly comparable with restrictions on social satire, so could not be considered a double standard unless one believed in an absolute right to freedom of speech, and that those who do would doubtless oppose holocaust denial laws. Columnist Charles Krauthammer wrote that there was a double standard in many protesters' demands for religious sensitivity in this case, but not in others. He asked, \"Have any of these 'moderates' ever protested the grotesque caricatures of Christians and, most especially, Jews that are broadcast throughout the Middle East on a daily basis?\"\n\nFrancis Fukuyama wrote in the online magazine \"Slate\" that \"while beginning with a commendable European desire to assert basic liberal values,\" the controversy was an alarming sign of the degree of cultural conflict between Muslim immigrant communities in Europe and their broader populations, and advocated a measured and prudent response to the situation. Helle Rytkonen wrote in \"Danish Foreign Policy Yearbook 2007\" that most of the debate around the cartoon controversy was over-simplified as a simple matter of free speech against religion. She said that the actual dispute was more nuanced, focusing on the tone of the debate and broader context of Western-Islamic relations.\n\nChristopher Hitchens wrote in \"Slate\" that official reaction in the Westparticularly the United Stateswas too lenient toward the protesters and Muslim community in Denmark, and insufficiently supportive of Denmark and the right to free speech. He said, \"nobody in authority can be found to state the obvious and the necessary—that we stand with the Danes against this defamation and blackmail and sabotage. Instead, all compassion and concern is apparently to be expended upon those who lit the powder trail, and who yell and scream for joy as the embassies of democracies are put to the torch in the capital cities of miserable, fly-blown dictatorships. Let's be sure we haven't hurt the vandals' \"feelings\".\" William Kristol also wrote that the response of Western leaders, with the exception of the Danish Prime Minister, was too weak and that the issue was used as an excuse by \"those who are threatened by our effort to help liberalize and civilize the Middle East\" to fight back against the \"assault\" on radical Islamists and Middle Eastern dictatorships.\n\nFlemming Rose said he did not expect a violent reaction, and talked about what the incident implies about the relationship between the West and the Muslim world. He said, \n\nOne of the principal lines of controversy surrounding the cartoons concerned the limits of free speech, how much it should be legally or ethically constrained and whether the cartoons were an appropriate expression for a newspaper to print. The cartoons were first printed in response to the perception of some journalists at the newspaper that self-censorship was becoming a problem; the ensuing reaction did nothing to dispel that idea. Rose said: \n\nRose also highlighted what he believed to be a difference between political correctness and self-censorshipwhich he considered more dangerous. He said: \n\nChristopher Hitchens wrote that it is important to affirm \"the right to criticize not merely Islam but religion in general\". He criticised media outlets which did not print the cartoons while covering the story. Ralf Dahrendorf wrote that the violent reaction to the cartoons constituted a sort of counter-enlightenment which must be defended against. Sonia Mikich wrote in \"Die Tageszeitung\", \"I hereby refuse to feel badly for the chronically insulted. I refuse to argue politely why freedom of expression, reason and humour should be respected\". She said that those things are part of a healthy society and that deeply held feelings or beliefs should not be exempt from commentary, and that those offended had the option of ignoring them.\n\nAshwani K. Peetush of Wilfrid Laurier University wrote that in a liberal democracy freedom of speech is not absolute, and that reasonable limits are put on it such as libel, defamation and hate speech laws in almost every society to protect individuals from \"devastating and direct harm\". He said that the cartoons \"create a social environment of conflict and intimidation for a community that already feels that its way of life is threatened. I do not see how such tactics incorporate people into the wider public and democratic sphere, as Rose argues. They have the opposite effect: the marginalised feel further marginalised and powerless.\" He said that it is reasonable to consider two of the cartoons as hate speech, which directly undermine a group of people (Muslims) by forming part of an established discourse linking all Muslims with terrorism and barbarity.\n\nIn France, satirical magazine \"Charlie Hebdo\" was taken to court for publishing the cartoons; it was acquitted of charges that it incited hatred. In Canada a human rights commission investigated \"The Western Standard\", a magazine which published the cartoons, but found insufficient grounds to proceed with a human rights tribunal (which does not imply criminal charges, but is a quasi-judicial, mandatory process) against the publication. These government investigations of journalists catalysed debate about the role of government in censoring or prosecuting expressions they deemed potentially hateful. Critics said the cartoon controversy was a sign that attempts at judicial codification of such concepts as respect, tolerance and offence have backfired on the West. Michael Neumann wrote, \"Western piety has left the West without a leg to stand on in this dispute. It is no good trumpeting rights of free expression, because these rights are now supposed to have nebulous but severe limitations.\" Tim Cavanaugh wrote that the incident revealed the danger of hate speech laws, writing, \"The issue will almost certainly lead to a revisiting of the lamentable laws against 'hate speech' in Europe, and with any luck to a debate on whether these laws are more likely to destroy public harmony than encourage it.\"\n\nThe following incidents are often compared to the cartoon controversy:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "382250", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=382250", "title": "Lexicostatistics", "text": "Lexicostatistics\n\nLexicostatistics is a method of comparative linguistics that involves comparing the percentage of lexical cognates between languages to determine their relationship. Lexicostatistics is related to the comparative method but does not reconstruct a proto-language. It is to be distinguished from glottochronology, which attempts to use lexicostatistical methods to estimate the length of time since two or more languages diverged from a common earlier proto-language. This is merely one application of lexicostatistics, however; other applications of it may not share the assumption of a constant rate of change for basic lexical items.\n\nThe term \"lexicostatistics\" is misleading in that mathematical equations are used but not statistics. Other features of a language may be used other than the lexicon, though this is unusual. Whereas the comparative method used shared identified innovations to determine sub-groups, lexicostatistics does not identify these. Lexicostatistics is a distance-based method, whereas the comparative method considers language characters directly. The lexicostatistics method is a simple and fast technique relative to the comparative method but has limitations (discussed below). It can be validated by cross-checking the trees produced by both methods.\n\nLexicostatistics was developed by Morris Swadesh in a series of articles in the 1950s, based on earlier ideas. The concept's first known use was by Dumont d'Urville in 1834 who compared various \"Oceanic\" languages and proposed a method for calculating a coefficient of relationship. Hymes (1960) and Embleton (1986) both review the history of lexicostatistics.\n\nThe aim is to generate a list of universally used meanings (hand, mouth, sky, I). Words are then collected for these meaning slots for each language being considered. Swadesh reduced a larger set of meanings down to 200 originally. He later found that it was necessary to reduce it further but that he could include some meanings that were not in his original list, giving his later 100-item list. The Swadesh list in Wiktionary gives the total 207 meanings in a number of languages. Alternative lists that apply more rigorous criteria have been generated, e.g. the Dolgopolsky list and the Leipzig–Jakarta list, as well as lists with a more specific scope; for example, Dyen, Kruskal and Black have 200 meanings for 84 Indo-European languages in digital form.\n\nA trained and experienced linguist is needed to make cognacy decisions. However, the decisions may need to be refined as the state of knowledge increases. However, lexicostatistics does not rely on all the decisions being correct. For each pair of lists the cognacy of a form could be positive, negative or indeterminate. Sometimes a language has multiple words for one meaning, e.g. \"small\" and \"little\" for \"not big\".\n\nThis percentage is related to the proportion of meanings for a particular language pair that are cognate, i.e. relative to the total without indeterminacy. This value is entered into a N x N table of distances, where N is the number of languages being compared. When complete this table is half-filled in triangular form. The higher the proportion of cognacy the closer the languages are related.\n\nCreation of the language tree is based solely on the table found above. Various sub-grouping methods can be used but that adopted by Dyen, Krustal and Black was:\n\nCalculations have to be of nucleus and group lexical percentages.\n\nA leading exponent of lexicostatistics application has been Isidore Dyen. He used lexicostatistics to classify Austronesian languages as well as Indo-European ones. A major study of the latter was reported by Dyen, Kruskal and Black (1992). Studies have also been carried out of Amerindian and African languages.\n\nPeople such as Hoijer (1956) have showed that there were difficulties in finding equivalents to the meaning items while many have found it necessary to modify Swadesh's lists. Gudschinsky (1956) questioned whether it was possible to obtain a universal list.\n\nFactors such as borrowing, tradition and taboo can skew the results, as with other methods. Sometimes lexicostatistics has been used with lexical similarity being used rather than cognacy to find resemblances. This is then equivalent to mass comparison.\n\nThe choice of meaning slots is subjective, as is the choice of synonyms.\n\nSome of the modern computational statistical hypothesis testing methods can be regarded as improvements of lexicostatistics in that they use similar word lists and distance measures.\n\n\n"}

The project has been described as \"web culture articulated as printed artifact,\" an \"archive of archives,\" characterized as an \"accumulation of accumulations,\" much of it printed on demand. Techniques for appropriating web content used by artists in the collection include \"grabbing\", \"hunting\", \"scraping\" and \"performing\", detailed by Soulellis in \"Search, Compile, Publish,\" and later referenced by Alessandro Ludovico.\n\nAmong the 130 artists included in Library of the Printed Web are Olia Lialina, Mishka Henner, Clement Valla, Karolis Kosas, Lauren Thorson, Cory Arcangel, Silvio Lorusso, Angela Genusa, Jean Keller, Aaron Krach, Joachim Schmid, Benjamin Shaykin, Chantal Zakari, Richard Prince, David Horvitz and Penelope Umbrico. Over 240 works are in the collection. Library of the Printed Web continues to grow through curatorial acquisition and artist contributions.\n\nThe collection is used primarily for experimental publishing research, as a way to question issues of copyright, privacy and appropriation by artists on the internet, and as the basis for academic workshops in design and new media.\n\nThe project is frequently featured at book fairs, independent publishing conferences and schools, appearing at Miss Read Berlin Art Book Fair, Stadtbibliothek Stuttgart, Merz Akademie, Printed Matter's NY Art Book Fair, Offprint London, Theorizing the Web, Interrupt 3 at Brown University, The Internet Yami-Ichi, Printed Matter's LA Art Book Fair, Odds and Ends Art Book Fair at Yale Art Gallery, Rhode Island School of Design School of Visual Arts, International Center of Photography, School of the Museum of Fine Arts Boston and Offprint Paris.

{"id": "10370383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10370383", "title": "Philippine mythical creatures", "text": "Philippine mythical creatures\n\nPhilippine folklore, unlike Greek, Norse or Egyptian mythologies, has not been organized into a formal pantheon, has not been relegated to history, nor does not generally contain long epics, though epics have been recorded, many of which are only partly recorded as majority have been abolished, slimmed, or altered under Spanish colonial rule. To this day, Philippine myths still have an active role in the lives of rural Filipinos. The countless myths circulating throughout the Filipino countryside contain a large variety of mythical creatures. Although there is no scientific evidence for any of these creatures, there is also no shortage in the rural parts of the Philippines of people who believe firmly in their existence. This discrepancy is sometimes rationalized by the explanation that only pure and good mortals are able to see these creatures. Although there is no scientific evidence that this creatures exist some people still believe that they are still alive up to this day especially in rural area. Very few of the following mythical creatures are 'national' in coverage, as usually, mythical creatures are endemic to the belief of specific ethnic groups in the Philippines. An example is the \"amahanlig\", which is only believed by the people of Western Visayas, while the \"malakat\" is endemic to Waray areas in Eastern Visayas. Other examples of ethnic-inclusiveness of mythical creatures in the Philippines is the \"ragit-ragit\" which is believed to live only in the islands of Romblon, while \"sarangay\" is only believed to thrive in Ibanag lands. Due to modern influences, some mythical creatures that were originally ethnically-endemic are now believed by other ethnic groups as well. An example is the \"tiyanak\" which used to be believed by the Tagalog people only. Today, majority of Filipinos know what a \"tiyanak\" is, and therefore, its influence is national in scale.\n\nAswang are shapeshifters, that are human-like by day, but, transform into different monstrous forms to harass and eat awake humans at night or day, especially pregnant women who are about to give birth. \"Aswang\" can change from a human to an animal form, usually as a big black bird with a long tongue (\"tiktik\"), as a half-bodied monster (\"manananggal\") as a bat, a cat, a pig or a black dog. Some \"aswang\" can change form at will, others through the use of foul oils concocted by good magicians (\"albularyo\", \"manggagaway\", \"manghihilot\"). \"Aswang\" appear at night (rarely during the day) to prey upon unwary travelers or sleeping people. It is said that they have a peculiar liking for the taste of human liver. The myth of the \"aswang\" is popular in the Visayas, especially in provinces such as Aklan, Capiz, Antique, and Ilo-Ilo. \"Aswang\" (mostly, \"tiktik\") also have a peculiar liking for the fetus of pregnant women and are said to find their quarry by the scent of the mother, which to the aswang smells like ripe jackfruit. Upon finding the house of the pregnant mother, the \"tiktik\" alights on the roof from where it stretches its tongue until it is as thin as a thread and uses it to enter the womb and feast on the fetus. The only way for a person to prevent this creature is to put one's brooms upside down, to put a \"badiawan twig\" all over his/her house's windows, or to put a blessed or a magic dagger in any parts of the house.\n\nBakunawa is a serpentine in Philippine mythology that is often represented as a gigantic sea serpent. It is believed to be the cause of eclipses. It is believed that he or she was just turned into a dragon as punishment. Bakunawa was a beautiful \"diwata\" in the sea; some say she was a \"naga\", and was the most powerful. One night, she saw the seven moons and was captivated by their beauty and longed to possess them. One of the embodiment of the moon descended to the sea to swim with the mermaids. It was Bulan, the adolescent aspect of the moon. The boy moon did not notice Bakunawa. Thinking the boy had ignored her beauty to play with the mermaids enraged her. The following night, she transformed herself into a dragon and devoured the moons. When she had swallowed the last moon, Bathala intervened, so she spit out the moon...\n\nBathala, \"Diyos\" or \"Apo\" it is the creation god in Tagalog myths.\n\nBerberoka ensnares its victims by drinking enough water in the pond until a number of fish appear into the surface. When the potential victims get attracted to the school of fish, the \"berberoka\" drowns them by hosing water and swallowing them afterwards.\n\nBungisngis is a one-eyed giant. This Philippine folklore giant lives in forest and woods. It is a happy and a playful cyclops, and is also commonly known as 'Mahentoy' in the northern part of Davao.\n\n\"Diwata\" (from Sanskrit devada, \"\"gods\"), \"engkantada\" (from Spanish: encantada, \"enchantress, charmed\"\") or engkanto (from Spanish: encanto, \"spell, incantation, charm\") are lesser gods and goddesses. Some are dryads who guard natural creations such as forests, seas, mountains, land and air. \n\n\"Diwatas\" are described as fair-skinned, good-looking, and sometimes, blonde-haired. They are said to reside in large trees, such as acacia and balete. They tend to be resentful of humanity's intrusion into their realm. They also bring blessings or curses upon those who do good or harm to the forests and mountains. One famous \"diwata\" is Maria Makiling, guardian of Mount Makiling in Laguna province. \"Engkanto\" (sometimes spelled \"Encanto\") is an umbrella term for most supernatural beings. The common connotation is that they are fairies who reside primarily in the forests and the sea. They can also be called \"encantado\" (male) or \"encantada\" (female).\n\nDuwende are goblins, hobgoblins, elves or dwarfs (\"Spanish\": \"duende\" \"\"goblin, elf, charm\" < \"duen de (casa)\"\", \"owner of the house\"). They are little creatures who can provide good fortune or bad fate to people. In the pre-colonial Philippines they were called mangalo and were believed to cause the death of children by eating their bowels. Also in pre-colonial Philippines, mainly Visayas, people believed that this race of creatures served and raised the goddess Burigadang Pada Sinaklang Bulawan. In modern-day beliefs \"duwende\" frequently live in houses, in trees, underground, termite like mound or hill, and in rural areas. They are known to be either good or mischievous, depending on how homeowners treat them. They usually come out at 12 noon for an hour and during the night. Filipinos always mutter words (\"tabi-tabi po\" or \"bari-bari apo ma ka ilabas kami apo\") asking them to excuse themselves for bothering the Duwendes. Filipinos would leave food on the floor, so that the \"duwende\" residing (or guarding) the house would not be angry with them. They also take a person's things, and laugh at him/her when you try to find it. They give it back when they feel like it, or when one tells them to please give it.\n\n\"Tiktik\" is a creature with a form of bird-like human. It is similar to \"wakwak\" in the common Filipino term. Both are winged-humans who at night search for victims. They hunger for flesh and blood especially to those of fetuses. \"Tiktik\" look like harpies, and both creatures are named after the sounds they create. According to stories, one cannot hear the \"tiktik\" and the \"aswang\" when they are very near. On the contrary, one will hear loud noises whenever they are far.\n\nA male diwata is coined as engkanto, but they are a totally different race. They are believed to be malevolent and physically attractive, having light colored hair and fangs. It resides primarily near the sea or any body of water. It is customary for Filipino fishermen to offer meat and other delicacies to the enkanto by throwing them into the sea, after a day's bountiful catch.\n\nGaruda is a large bird-like creature, or humanoid bird \nmuscular upper body of a man but the face and large wings of the great eagle who is believed to eat men\n\nKapre is a filthy giant who likes to smoke huge rolls of cigars, and hide within, and atop large trees, particularly the balete and old acacia or mango trees. A Filipino bigfoot, it scares away little children who play at night. If one is stuck in a place and keeps going around in circles, one is said to be played around with by a \"kapre\". To escape its control, one must remove his/her shirt/clothing, and wear it inside-out.\n\nIn the pre-colonial Philippines, the Kinnara or Kinnari are symbolic of androgynous beauty and of a lover's devotion, ethereal beauty, and one's undying devotion towards a lover. Pre-colonial gold pieces have been found depicting such otherworldly beauty. The Kinnara is described as gentle, loyal, and subservient creatures. They are depicted as having a beautiful face, the upper body of a slender woman or boy with wings. Alternately, a kinnara can transform its hands and limbs into feathered wings for flight and the lower body of a bird description varies. Kinnaras are skilled dancers and musicians, performing solely for their lover.\nThe golden vessel kinnari was found in 1981 in Surigao. The kinnari exists in both Buddhist and Hindu mythology. In Buddhism, the kinnari, a half-human, and half-bird creature represent enlightened action. The Buddhist Lotus Sutra mentions the kinnari as the celestial musician in the Himavanta realm. The kinnari takes the form of a centaur, however, in India's epic poem, the Mahabharata, and in the Veda's Purana part.\n\nNaga's other names are \"marindaga\", \"marinaga\", and \"maginaga\". They are a type of fresh water mermaids, but instead of having fish tails they have eels and/or water snakes for tails and the upper body of a human female having alluring face, curvaceous body and long flowing hair.\n\nVicious to adults but gentle to children are considered the protectors of springs, wells and rivers. They bring rain, and thus fertility, but are also thought to bring disasters such as floods and drought.\n\nNagas are snake-like mermaids that may take human form. They tend to be very curious. According to traditions nāgas are only malevolent to humans when they have been mistreated. They are susceptible to mankind's disrespectful actions in relation to the environment. They are also associated with waters—rivers, lakes, seas, and wells—and are generally regarded as guardians of treasure.\n\nIn other beliefs the most powerful of the Nagas became a goddess named Bakunawa. She is captivated by the beauty of the seven moons and turned herself into a giant dragon-serpent in order to reach them, but the deity Bathala punished her so she remained in her dragon state for all eternity.\n\n\"Malakas and Maganda\" (literally, \"Strong One\" and \"Beautiful One\") are Filipino versions of Adam and Eve. They are said to have sprung from a large bamboo tree pecked by a \"sarimanok\" known as Magaulancealabarca.\n\nThe Magindara are fierce water creatures with the upper body of attractive women and the lower body of multicolored fishes. They lure men to drown them. It is believed that the lunar deity Bulan the boy moon descended and tamed the vicious creatures, turning them into friendly Mermaids.\n\n\"Mambabarang\" (summoner) is a witch who uses insects and spirits to enter the body of any person they hate. A \"mambabarang\" is a kind of a \"mangkukulam\". \"Mambabarang\" are ordinary human beings with black magic who torture and later kill their victims by infesting their bodies with insects. They are different from \"mangkukulams\" - the latter only inflict pain or illness. \"Mambabarang\" use a strand of hair from their chosen victim and tie it to the bugs or worms which they will use as a medium. When they prick the bug, the victim immediately experiences the intended effect.\n\nManananggal is an \"aswang\" that can fly after separating itself from the lower half of its body. It eats babies and fetuses from a mother's womb by means of passing their long tongue through a small hole from the roof of a house. The sharp end of the tongue touches the mother's navel to suck the blood of the fetus or unborn child. This creature's name was derived from the Filipino word, \"tanggal\", which means \"to separate\" because of the manananggal's ability to separate itself from its lower body.\n\nA \"manananggal\" can also be a sorceress that visits villages and barrios. To feed, the self-segmenter chooses an isolated place where she will leave her lower torso while she hunts at night. When she separates from her lower torso, she then gains her ability to fly. She then goes off in search of houses where pregnant women reside. Upon choosing a suitable victim, the \"manananggal\" alights on the house and inserts her tongue through the roof. The tongue is long, hollow and extremely flexible. She uses it to puncture the womb of the sleeping woman and to suck out the fetus. At other times, she seduces men with her beauty and lures them to a private place before eating them alive. She usually eats the insides, like the heart, stomach or the liver. Sunlight is deadly to the \"manananggal\" when she is in her monstrous form.If her two halves are still separate with the coming of dawn, she will be destroyed. According to legend, to destroy the \"manananggal\", one should search for the lower torso that she leaves behind during her nightly hunts. Salt, ash, and/or garlic should then be placed on the exposed flesh, preventing the monster from combining again and leaving it vulnerable to sunlight. Small containers of salt, ash and raw rice, and the smell of burning rubber are said to deter the \"manananggal\" from approaching one's house.\n\nThe manaul is a mythical king who became a bird. He was believed to have caused the seas and the skies to fight against each other. The clash between the seas and skies resulted to the formation of the Philippine islands.\n\nMangkukulam or \"bruha\" (from Spanish: bruja, \"\"witch\") are witches, wizards, \"bruho\" (Spanish:brujo, \"wizard, male witch\"\"), or sorcerers who cast evil spells to humans. This bewitcher is also called \"manggagaway\". The \"Mangkukulam\" uses dark magic.\n\nThe difference between a \"mambabarang\" and a \"mangkukulam\" is that the \"mambabarang\" uses magical insects to bring harm to his victims. These insects are released after incantations, when they will search for their supposed victim and burrow under the skin, impregnating her. After some time, matruculans return to the house to kill the pregnant mother, open her abdomen, and eat the growing fetus.\n\nMariang Makiling is a fairy who dwells atop Laguna's Mount Makiling, an inactive volcano. Oral tradition described that Mount Makiling was once a castle and Mariang Makiling was a princess who fell in love with a mortal.\n\nMulto, the Tagalog word for ghost, comes from the Spanish word \"muerto\", which means \"dead\". Superstitious Filipinos believe that some kind of \"multo\", often a spirit of their former kin, regularly visits them.\n\nNuno sa punso (literally, \"goblin of the mound\") are goblins or elves who live within mysterious lumps of soil (ant hills). They can provide a person who steps on their shelter with good luck or misfortune. Superstitious Filipinos, when passing by a mound, will ask the resident nuno's permission to let them pass with the phrase, \"Tabi-tabi po\". Strange and sudden illnesses that befall a person are sometimes attributed to nunos. It is also said that nunos don't like being pointed at, and could cause one to break a person's finger. If a medical condition is untreatable by modern medicine, it is often considered that a \"nuno\" has placed a curse on the patient. A special practitioner called \"albularyo\", he carries out a traditional ceremony, melting candle wax into a spoon, pouring it into water and reading the shape formed by the wax thus informing their suggestions on how to dispel the curse. Usually this healing process involves an offering of food drink or trinkets to the \"nuno\". Failing that the patient can ask the \"nuno\"’s forgiveness which usually works. As a last resort though catching a \"nuno\" and crushing its head is a sure way to remove the curse.\n\nPasatsat is word rooted on the Pangasinense word \"satsat\", meaning \"to stab\". \"Pasatsat\" are ghosts of people who died or were killed in the Second World War. Coffins during the time were so expensive, so the families of the dead wrapped the corpses in reed mats or \"icamen\". The dead were buried in places other than cemeteries because tomb robberies were rampant during that era of extreme poverty. These ghosts usually show up in solitary paths and block passersby. To get rid of such a ghost, one needs to stab (hence \"pasatsat\") the reed mat and unravel it, but doing so will show no presence of a corpse, although the mat will emit a noxious odor, much like that of putrid flesh.\n\nThe \"mangalyo\" or \"santilmu\" appears in the form of a ball of fire. Pre-colonial islanders believed it is a living entity It is presently known as Santelmo, or \"Santo Elmo\", is a fireball seen by dozens of Filipinos, especially those living in the Sierra Madre Mountains. It was scientifically explained as electric fields which have diverged from the lines. However, the sightings were reported since the Spanish era (16th-19th centuries). (See also \"Shinen\" and \"Will-o-Wisps\") There were also sightings in the Alps and Himalayas.\n\nSarangay is a creature resembling a bull with a huge muscular body and a jewel attached to its ears.\n\nSarimanok is a magical, mythical bird who brings good luck to anyone who are able to catch it. The name \"sarimanok\" is conjoined of two different words ‘Sari’ meaning garment usually very colorful and ‘Manok’ which means chicken. It is quite a humble name for so revered and beautiful creature. It’s a legendary bird from the mythology of the Maranao people of the Philippines and is an omen of very good fortune.A \"sarimanok\" known as Magaul is associated with the legend of Malakas and Maganda. Magaul was the \"sarimanok\" bird that pecked the bamboo from where Malakas and Maganda were born from.\n\n\"Sirena\" is a mermaid, a sea creature with a human upper body and a fish tail instead of lower extremities. beautiful but vicious they were called Magindara and were guardians of the waters of \"asin-palan(Pangasinan)\" guarding it from the tattooed raiders from the Visayas.\nIn Pre-colonial Philippines, it is believed that in the full moon or in the Dayaw or Kadayawan, one of the embodiment of the moon who is Bulan descended from the heavens to swim with the mermaids and that the mermaids protected the boy moon from sea monsters. They attract fishermen and lure them to their deaths but sometimes they fall in love. \"Sirena\" are reportedly often seen ashore by fishermen, especially in the towns bordering the Pacific Ocean.\n\nSiyokoy are mermen, sea creatures that have a human form and scaled bodies. The \"Siyokoy\" is the male counterpart of the Sirena. The lower extremities of a Philippine merman can either be a fishtail or scaled legs and webbed feet. They could also have long, green tentacles. They drown mortals who trespass into their territory. \"Siyokoy\" have gill slits, are colored brown or green, and have scaly skin, comparable to that of a fish.\n\nTamawo or \"tamao\" are mythogical creatures believed to be handsome having very fair to white skin with fangs and claws of gold. It is believed to be clad in gold and wears \"putong\" and \"bahag\" like the nobles of pre-colonial Visayas.\nThe \"tamawo\" were known by its different names: the \"bumalabag\", male fairy who viewed and visited places; the \"manupongtupong\", a male fairy who dresses like an ordinary man; the \"manla-awla-aw\" who looked out from behind an anthill; \"manilag-nilag\", a female fairy who attended social gatherings and festivities; and the \"manbukay\", a female fairy who dwelt in shallow wells.\n\nThey are the sylphs in Bicol lore hand maidens to a lunar deity. They are believed to be lithe and attractive youths capable of flight and can send gust of winds to people who do misdeeds. They are also mentioned in the epic of Ibalong, One of the heroes is believed to have descended from their race.\n\nTikbalang or \"tigbalang\" (demon horse) is a half-man and half-horse creature. It has a horse's head, the body of a human but with the feet of the horse. It travels at night to rape female mortals. The raped women will then give birth to more \"tikbalang\". They are also believed to cause travelers to lose their way particularly in mountainous or forest areas. \"Tikbalang\" are very playful with people, and they usually make a person imagine things that aren't real. Sometimes a \"tikbalang\" will drive a person crazy. It is said that a person can render the Tikbalang’s tricks futile somehow by wearing their shirt inside out. One can avoid the \"tikbalang\" all together by just keeping quiet or by asking politely to pass it by. The \"tikbalang\" is not particularly dangerous to humans though and it can even be tamed. Legends say that when rain falls while the sun is shining, a pair of \"tikbalang\" are being wed. Since horses only arrived in the Philippine archipelago during the Spanish colonization (thus, the borrowed term 'kabayo'), there is a theory that the image of a half-horse, half-man creature was propagated by the conquistadors to keep the natives afraid of the night. There are stories claiming that the \"tikbalang\" are actually half-bird, half-man creatures, much like the Japanese tengu.\n\nTiyanak are babies who died before receiving baptism rites. After death, they go to a place known as Limbo, a chamber of Hell which unbaptized dead people fall into, and are transformed into evil spirits. These phantasms return into the mortal realm in the form of goblins to eat living victims. The \"tiyanak\" can also be the offspring of a woman and a demon. It can also be an aborted fetus which comes back to take revenge on its mother. Most Tiyanaks are said to live in forests. If they see a human, they transform into what looks like a normal baby. When the person notices the Tiyanak and comes near to take a look at it, the Tiyanak changes back to its true form and eats its prey. And since they often seen coming out of trees it may also refer to Tboli legends, Tibolis are known for hanging their infants in trees who died after birth.\n\nWakwak originated from the word Uwak which is the \"Tagalog\" for Crow. It is assumed to grab humans at night as its prey, just like Manananggal and the tiktik who can fly. It likes to haunt in the rural areas of the Philippines. The Wakwak has no ability to separate its torso from its body. Some people believed that it is a night bird that belongs to a witch.\n\nThe Wakwak makes a sound by flapping its wings while flying. The sound that it produced is typically linked to the presence of an Unglu (vampire) or Ungo (ghost or monster). The Wakwak’s sound also indicates that it is searching for victims. When the sound is loud, it means that it is far from you. If not, then it is near you and ready to attack. The Wakwak rips and maims its victims and then feeds on their hearts. The old folks described the Wakwak as creatures with long sharp talons and a pair of wings just like bats. Its talons or claws are used in slashing its victims in order to retrieve their hearts.\n\n\n\n"}

A leading Dutch representative was Jan Davidsz. de Heem, who spent a long period of his active career in Antwerp and was one of the founders of the style in Holland.\n\nCornelis Norbertus Gijsbrechts developed the style further by incorporating pronkstillevens in the trompe-l'œil compositions for which he was known. An example is his \"\" at the Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent.\n\nPronkstillevens are usually interpreted as a form of vanitas painting that conveys a moral lesson. The various objects in the compositions serve as symbols that can be read as an admonition or a life lesson. The objects usually refer to the transience and emptiness of wealth and possessions and the ultimate extinction and emptiness of earthly life.\n\nFor instance, roses are often used as a vanitas motif, as they recall that all life and earthly beauty are fleeting. Hourglasses are an admonition that life is fleeting and will end. Empty containers such as glasses or vases point to the emptiness of earthly wealth and aspirations. The paintings remind the viewer of the need to practice moderation and temperance.\n"}

It provides to all the actors of the entire computer-based assessment process a comprehensive set of functionalities enabling the creation, the management, and the delivery of electronic assessments.\nThe TAO platform is developed by the EMACS research unit of the University of Luxembourg and the SSI department of the Centre de Recherche Public Henri Tudor.\n\nThe TAO framework is an open-source project which provides a very general and open architecture for computer-assisted test development and delivery. As upcoming evaluation needs will imply the collaboration among a large number of stakeholders situated at different institutional levels and with very different needs for assessment tools, the TAO framework has the ambition to provide a modular and versatile framework for collaborative distributed test development and delivery with the potential to be extended and adapted to virtually every evaluation purpose that could be handled by the means of computer-based assessment.\n\nIn order to reach this goal, the testing problem has been broken down into its constitutive parts:\n\nThese parts are implemented under the form of multiple specialized modules connected in a peer-to-peer network. As the TAO architecture should fit into many different use cases, there is no central node in the system (the whole network of TAO nodes is an open-system with no global consistency) and it is assumed that there cannot be an a priori model for each data domain that reaches consensus within all the actors. On the contrary, each module owner or user is free to build the model that best corresponds to his own view. In order to support this model diversity, TAO modules are equipped with advanced modelling functionalities allowing users to build dynamically their own model and share data organized according to different models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe description of the platform architecture at the current stage is organized on a component basis. A part of these components are independent from the computer-assisted testing domain.\n\nThe TAO platform should be considered as a particular instantiation (for a particular purpose) of a more general platform dedicated to the collaborative and distributed management of web resources and of the ontologies describing these resources. The more specific components will be presented afterward. The TAO platform consists in a series of interconnected modules. Each module is a specialization of a more generic kernel application called Generis4.\n\nThe specialization consists in adding a specific model to the kernel defining the domain of specialization, several plug-ins providing specific functionalities to the specialization according to the domain and relying on specific properties of the model, possibly some external applications, and a specific (optional) user graphical interface.\n\nTAO is designed as a modular system. This decentralised structure is necessary on one hand to maintain the anonymity of the Subjects and on the other hand to allow the collaboration among several users, to change items and tests.\n\nThe modules may be placed on the same server or on different servers connected through the internet or local area networks.\n\nThere is a distinction between the portal of test execution (Delivery Server) and the servers of the different modules, providing the information about Subjects, Groups, Items, Tests, Deliveries and Results.\n\nIn the Subject module the testees are recorded and managed. Its flexibility allows the design of datasheets (e.g. name, address, birthday, gender, etc.). The Subjects may be assigned to sets according to the specific assessment context (Human resources management, education, edumetric monitoring, etc.).\n\nThe subjects may be subsumed in regard to global features and classifications in the Group module. The main object of this module is to assign the favoured test(s) to the appointed group. The Subjects and Tests that belong to one group may be originated from different modules on different servers. This module establishes the basis to run a test.\n\nThe Item module enables the creation and design of items, exercises. Different kinds of templates are provided to the item authors like Multiple Choice Question, puzzle design, Fill-in-the-gap, etc. Any other demands may be added within the scope of further development.\n\nA selection of favourite Items – originated from different modules on different servers - is combined to a test in the Test module. Furthermore, the test mode (sequencing, scoring, cumulating, etc.) and layout is configured here.\n\nIn the Delivery module the test administrator will be able to define test campaigns, constraints on test execution (Test may be made available during a given period, Tests may be assigned with a maximum number of executions). This module will also enable to select on which Result module all results should be sent to.\n\nThe Test Delivery Server provides the compiled tests via URL. The Subjects will access their assigned Test(s) through their logins and passwords.\nFinally all the results of passed tests with referring Subject, Group, Item and Test specific data as well as the individual data collected during test execution are stored and managed in the Result module.\n\nTests or surveys consist of items (exercises, questions) that may have different characteristics.These characteristics are defined by Item Templates. They describe the way an item is presented.\n\nOn the basis of a certain template an item is filled with text and/or multimedia elements, the Item Content. This process is called item authoring.\n\nThe main constituents of a particular item are its underlying Item Template and its specific Item Content.\n\nTAO provides the following Item templates (types of items):\n\n\n\nThe TAO platform is released under the GPL v2 licence.\n\n"}

It is the second part of the \"Condor Trilogy\" and was preceded by \"The Legend of the Condor Heroes\" and followed by \"The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber\". It was first serialised between 20 May 1959 and 5 July 1961 in the Hong Kong newspaper \"Ming Pao\".\n\nThe story revolves around the protagonist, Yang Guo, and his lover and martial arts master, Xiaolongnü, in their adventures in the \"jianghu\" (also called the \"wulin\", the community of martial artists), where love between master and apprentice is seen as taboo. Jin Yong revised the novel in 1970 and again in 2004. There are 40 chapters in the second and third revisions. Each chapter has a title composed of four Chinese characters. Most of the revisions are either clarifications or minor alterations of character motivations or names. The Chinese title of the novel translates to \"The Divine Eagle and the Heroic Couple\".\n\nThe protagonist, Yang Guo, is the orphaned son of Yang Kang, one of the antagonists in \"The Legend of the Condor Heroes\", who is also the sworn brother of Guo Jing. The couple Guo Jing and Huang Rong take care of Yang Guo for a short period of time before sending him to the Quanzhen Sect on Mount Zhongnan for better guidance in moral values and orthodox martial arts. In Quanzhen, Yang Guo is often picked on and bullied by his fellow students, and discriminated against by his master, Zhao Zhijing. Yang Guo flees from Quanzhen and ventures unknowingly into the nearby Tomb of the Living Dead, where the Ancient Tomb Sect is based. There, he meets Xiaolongnü, a mysterious maiden of unknown origin, and becomes her apprentice. They live together in the tomb for many years until Yang Guo grows up.\n\nYang Guo and Xiaolongnü develop romantic feelings for each other, but their romance is forbidden by the prevailing norms of the \"jianghu\" (or \"wulin\", the community of martial artists). Throughout the story, their love meets with several tests, such as the misunderstandings that threaten to tear them apart, and their encounter with Gongsun Zhi, whom Xiaolongnü almost marries at one point. Finally, after their reunion and marriage, Xiaolongnü leaves Yang Guo again, owing to her belief she cannot recover from a fatal poison and promises to meet him again 16 years later, to prevent him from committing suicide. While Yang Guo is wandering the \"jianghu\" alone, he meets several formidable martial artists and a giant eagle, and improves his skills tremendously after learning from them. His adventures gradually mold him into a courageous hero and perhaps the most powerful martial artist of his time. Yang Guo serves his native land by helping the Han Chinese people of the Song Empire resist invaders from the Mongol Empire. At the end of the novel, he is reunited with Xiaolongnü and they leave to lead the rest of their lives in seclusion after receiving praises and blessings from the \"wulin\".\n\nAsiapac Books acquired the rights to produce an illustrated version of the novel in 1995. The 18 volume comic series was illustrated by Wee Tian Beng and translated by Jean Lim with Jin Yong's approval. The lavishly illustrated series won the Prestigious Award in 1997 during the Asian Comics Conference held in South Korea. Notable deviations from the main story include funny strips that poke gentle fun at some of the story's events, in line with conventions of the comic book medium.\n\nIn 2002 ComicsOne published the first official English translation of \"Legendary Couple\", a retelling of the novel. The comic series was illustrated by Wong Yuk-long while Jin Yong was credited as the writer.\n\nSoftworld released a RPG based on the novel for the DOS.

{"id": "5161973", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5161973", "title": "Tombs of the Blind Dead", "text": "Tombs of the Blind Dead\n\nTombs of the Blind Dead is a 1972 Spanish-Portuguese horror film written and directed by Amando de Ossorio. Its original Spanish title is La noche del terror ciego ( English: \"The Night of the Blind Terror\").\n\nThe film was the first in Ossorio's \"Blind Dead\" series, spawning three official sequels: \"Return of the Blind Dead\" (1973), \"The Ghost Galleon\" (1974) and \"Night of the Seagulls\" (1975). Its success helped kickstart the Spanish horror film boom of the early 1970s.\n\nOssorio has stated that Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer's Gothic horror legend \"El monte de las ánimas\" (1862) and George Romero's \"Night of the Living Dead\" (1968) both influenced the creation of his film. \n\nLegend has that in the abandoned medieval town of Berzano, at the border between Spain and Portugal, the Knights Templar (a fictionalized version of the real-life order that was dissolved in the 14th century following charges of witchcraft and heresy) leave their tombs at night and come back from the dead as revenants. The reanimated corpses are blind, because their eyes were pecked out by birds while their hanged bodies rotted on the gallows.\n\nWhile on vacation nearby with her friend Roger Whelan, Virginia White reconnects with her dear college friend Betty \"Bet\" Turner , who relocated in the area and now runs a mannequin factory. Roger immediately takes a liking to Betty and invites her along for a train journey, provoking Virginia's jealousy, as the two women had had a romantic relationship years prior. Angry at both, Virginia jumps off the train. Wandering through the country, she comes upon the ruins of Berzano, where she decides to camp overnight. The knights rise from their tombs and attack her, ultimately biting and ripping her flesh. Her corpse is found in a field the following morning by the returning train conductor.\n\nThe next morning, Betty and Roger retrace Virginia's steps, trying to find out what happened to her. They hear about the legend from some locals and meet two police investigators who inform them about Virginia's horrible fate. Later at the morgue, next to Betty's laboratory, Virginia's corpse comes back to life and kills a custodian, then flees to the lab and is only stopped by Betty's assistant, who manages to set Virginia on fire inside the mannequin factory.\n\nIn the meantime, Betty and Roger are investigating the legend with the help of Professor Pedro Candal, who indirectly send them to find his son Pedro, who lives near Berzano as a small-time smuggler and is suspected by the police to be the one who killed Virginia as a way to instill fear in the locals. Once they've located Pedro and convinced him to help them prove the knights are real, Betty and Roger return with Pedro and his lover Nina to Berzano, to confront the knights once and for all.\n\nUpon their arrival, they are confronted by the knights, who kill Roger, Pedro and Nina. The knights find Betty through her heartbeat, and she flees from Berzano with the knights in pursuit. She boards a passing train, hiding in a cargo of coal. The knights take charge of the train, killing the conductor and cannibalizing passengers onboard. The train arrives at the station shortly thereafter, and Betty, speechless, is helped by a station attendant. As several passengers go to board the train, they scream in horror at the sight inside.\n\n\nAlthough the Knights are identifiable by their uniforms, they are never called \"Templars\" in the film; they are referred to as \"Knights from the East\". Ossorio objected to the description of the revenant Templars as \"zombies\", insisting that they more resembled mummies who feed like vampires and that, unlike zombies, the Templars were not mindless corpses.\n\nExterior scenes in the film were shot in Portugal and Spain. In Portugal, locations included Lisbon and surrounding areas (Estoril, Setúbal, Sesimbra y Palmela). In Spain, film credits mention the monastery at El Cercón, Madrid, but the scenes with the impressive sinister ruins were filmed at the Santa María La Real de Valdeiglesias monastery in Pelayos de la Presa.\n\nThe Spanish version, \"La noche del terror ciego\", differed from the retitled English version. In the latter, a flashback of the living Knights Templar torturing and drinking the blood of a female victim was moved to the beginning of the film, and most of the sex and gore (for instance, the scene depicting the lesbian relationship between Betty and Virginia, and the sequence on a train in which the Knights kill a woman in front of her child) were removed.\n\nAmerican distributors decided to severely re-edit the film for its English-language release and add a new opening scene to cash in on the success of the \"Planet of the Apes\" film series. The plan was to replace the film's original setting with a post-apocalyptic future in which the undead were deceased intelligent apes, similar to the ones seen in \"Planet of the Apes\". Rather than doing a reshoot, location footage from the film was edited together, the Templar flashback sequence was removed, and a narration track explaining the premise was produced as an introduction. The revised film was retitled \"Revenge from Planet Ape\".\n\nThe film was released on DVD on 20 October 1998 by Anchor Bay Entertainment as a double feature with \"Return of the Blind Dead\".\n\nIt was released again on DVD on 27 September 2005 as a five-disc limited edition by Blue Underground featuring the film and its three sequels; the DVD of the film in this release contained both the original Spanish version (subtitled but not dubbed) and the \"Revenge from Planet Ape\" opening sequence. It was reissues again by Blue Underground on o26 September 2006 as a stand-alone release. \n\nOn 1 July 2016, the film was again reissued in a four-disc set by Blue Underground featuring the film and its three sequels.\n\nWriting in \"The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia\", academic Peter Dendle said, \"Spanish filmmaker de Ossorio earned international fame with this widely popular tale of blind zombie monks, creating a fresh mythology and unforgettable zombies, all set against imposing scenic backgrounds\". Allmovie gave the film a positive review, praising the film's make-up effects, chilling atmosphere, and soundtrack.\n\"TV Guide\" awarded the film 2 out of 4 stars and called it \"a slow and lackadaisically plotted thirsty-corpse movie distinguished by terrific music and locations, and genuinely eerie zombies\". Brett H. from \"Oh the Horror!\" gave the film a positive review, stating, \"\"Tombs of the Blind Dead\" is a slow moving Spanish classic that is a must see for all fans of creature features with ample amounts of all the things that make horror great. It's not perfect and it does have some small inconsistencies (why in the world are the Templars so powerful, yet sometimes swing their swords like goofy puppets?), but you'll be too engulfed in the atmosphere and monsters to worry too much about it\". \n\nJeremy Zoss from \"Film Threat\" gave the film a negative review, stating, \"Like many old works of entertainment from Mexico [\"sic\"], \"Tombs of the Blind Dead\" is not without its charms. It would be a great film to watch while drunk with a group of friends. However, when looking for a real horror film, the \"Blind Dead\" are definitely not worth seeing\". Film critic John Kenneth Muir gave the film a mostly positive review, writing that the film lost momentum after the first act but praised the film's suspense, unsettling imagery and the effectiveness of the Templar revenants as \"genuinely scary\". Adam Tyner of DVD Talk wrote, \"Although \"Tombs of the Blind Dead\" isn't a particularly gory film, several of its sequences are deeply unsettling\".\n\nThe film has an approval rating of 57% on film review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes and an average rating of 5.5 out of 10 based on seven reviews.\n\nThe Blind Dead (Knights Templar) villains were unofficially resurrected in the 1975 entry \"La cruz del diablo\", directed by John Gilling.\n\nThe film was an influence on \"Mansion of the Living Dead\", a 1982 film directed by Jesús Franco. \n\nMore recently, the Templar appeared in the unofficial, shot-on-video sequel \"Graveyard of the Dead\", also known as \"El retorno de los templarios\" (2009).and in supporting roles in \"Don't Wake the Dead\" (2008) and \"Unrated: The Movie\" (2009), two films by German director Andreas Schnaas.\n\nThe short comic story \"Ascension of the Blind Dead\" appeared in the 2010 Asylum Press graphic novel \"Zombie Terrors Volume 1\", written by David Zuzelo with artwork by William Skaar.\n\nIn 2015, Emma Dark and Merlyn Roberts co-directed an unofficial short film sequel, \"Island of the Blind Dead\".\n\n"}

It is now a writer's house museum.\n\nThe White Dacha was built in 1898 following Chekhov's success with \"The Seagull\". He took up residence there after his father's death and to aid him with coping with tuberculosis. Chekhov planted a variety of trees including mulberry, cherry, almond, peach, cypress, citrus, acacia and birch. He also kept dogs and tame cranes.\n\nThe house was designed by L.N. Shapovalov. Aleksandr Kuprin described the house as follows,\nIt was, perhaps, the most original building in Yalta. It is all white, pure, easy, beautifully asymmetrical, ... with a tower, and unexpected ledges, with a glass veranda below and an open terrace above, with scattered broad and narrow windows... \".\nV.N. Ladygensky mentioned that \"a dacha in Crimea, in Аutka, near Yalta, was validly constructed, excellent\".\nFrom the study one can see the seafront that inspired \"The Lady with the Dog\", and at the back the scene that inspired the setting of \"The Cherry Orchard\" is visible. He also wrote the \"Three Sisters\" and \"The Bishop\" on the site.\n\nAfter Chekhov's death (1904) the house was looked after by his sister, Masha, until 1921 when it became a museum. During the Nazi occupation Maria Pavlovna refused to leave and put up pictures of Hauptmann (the German dramatist) any \"a...dramatist\" on the wall and refused to let a German officer move into her brother's rooms. Nothing went missing but the house was damaged by one of the last air raids on the area by the Luftwaffe. \n\nThe Soviet government, as with other such heritage sites, diligently looked after the house but following the breakup of the USSR, the responsibility for the house's upkeep came under dispute. Crimea became an autonomous republic within Ukraine. The museum falls under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Culture of the Crimean Autonomous Republic and their budget is extremely small. The Ukrainian state authorities would like the Russian government to pay for upkeep since Chekhov was Russian, but the Russians do not agree. The house has now become dilapidated. On May 11, 2010, Ukrainian President, Viktor Yanukovych, ordered that repairs and restoration work be carried out on the house.\n\nChekhov was a noted host and entertained Leo Tolstoy, Feodor Chaliapin, Sergei Rachmaninoff, and Maxim Gorky at the Dacha. Leonid Kuchma and Vladimir Putin and their spouses visited the museum in 2003.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38226601", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38226601", "title": "Women migrant workers from developing countries", "text": "Women migrant workers from developing countries\n\nSince the late 20th century, substantial labour migration from developing countries to high-income countries has occurred. \nThis includes a substantial portion of female migrants. The term feminization of migration has been proposed as a suggested \"gendered pattern\" in international migration where there is a trend towards a higher percentage of women among voluntary migrants.\nStudies on women migrant workers in high-income countries tend to focus on their employment in domestic work and care work for dual-income families.\n\nFor more than 4 decades, female migrant numbers have rivaled those of male migrants. By 2000, the difference between female and male migrant numbers stayed about the same since 1960, with 5 million more male migrants than female migrants.\n\nAccording to estimates published by the World Bank, there has been only a slight increase in the percentage of women among international migrants over the past fifty years, with 46.7% estimated for 1960 and 48.4% for 2010. \n\nAlthough \"South-South migration\" (migration between developing countries) is generally more substantial than migration from developing to high-income countries, the World Bank estimates that there are about 73 million migrants from developing countries living in high-income OECD countries; about half being female and half being male.\n\nAccording to censuses carried out in 1990, the United Nations Population Division estimated that women constitute 48% of all migrants. In 2000, 52% of the 56 million migrants in Europe were female. The number of immigrants in Europe has continually increased, due to a higher demand for care work for multi-income families, among other things. The major sites for female labor include GCC countries in Western Asia as well as Pacific Rim countries in Eastern and Southeastern Asia. By 2000, there were 5 million female migrants compared to 4.9 million male migrants in Eastern and Southeastern Asia. In Western Asia, female migrants constituted 48% of all migrants in the region.\n\nWomen migrants work in domestic occupations that are considered part of the informal sector and lack a degree of government regulation and protection. Lourdes Beneria, a feminist economist, argues that the demand for care work in Europe in the 1990s and 2000s has brought young Latinas to countries like Spain, in order to provide care work for the aging population. The demand for these workers has risen due to an increasing number of European women moving toward the formal sector of work, leaving their domestic duties for hire.\n\nWomen leaving their country of origin are often considered to be temporary migrants. They leave for an uncertain amount of time, with the intent to return to their homeland after they have earned enough money. Given that women are statistically better at saving their capital gains, they are becoming increasingly economically significant to the capital gains of their country of origin. This can be measured through remittances and how much is sent back to the country of origin. Documentaries, such as \"Letters from the Other Side\", illustrate that after some time, remittances may cease due to new responsibilities or new circumstances that migrant workers face.\n\nEconomic impacts and the impact of women working abroad have both negative and positive impacts upon traditional family roles, children, and gender roles. In addition to diversifying the domestic workforce, women migrant workers also impact the global economy. Remittances by women migrant workers help bolster the GDPs of their countries of origin.\n\nThe term feminization of migration was used by the United Nations in a 2007 working paper. It refers to an increase in the proportion of female migrant workers.\n\nFor a long time, females have constituted a high proportion of all international migrants. In 1960, females constituted 47 out of every 100 migrants residing in a foreign country. In 2000, women made up almost 49% of all international migrants. Although these statistics illustrate a \"feminization of migration\", a high level of feminization already existed in 1960.\n\nFemale laborers are mostly found in low-status and unskilled occupations. In addition to this, \"women migrants are particularly vulnerable to human trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation, a multimillion-dollar business.\"\n\nMany women in Latin America respond to demands created in Europe, especially Spain, for jobs as care workers for dual-income houses. This demand is created by the increase in European women moving from their traditional household labors to market work, where they can contribute to a company's bottom line.\n\nLimited education can force those with a lack of skills to move to a foreign country to help support their family, but these situations often promote exploitation.\n\nThe increase in feminization of migration has led to an increase in concerns regarding females' security in the locations in which they are moving to such as human rights issues and security. The controversy surrounding migration has led to challenges for international analysts as they look to change implications. Assumptions have been made regarding the reason women migrate, which causes popular debate among developing countries in considering implication changes.\n\nSome of the issues this research addresses are remittances and their economic impacts, family cohesion, the racialization of migrants, human trafficking, gendered division of labor, and economic as well as educational opportunities. Prior to the gender studies boom of the 1990s, statistical evidence on migration patterns have not often been classified by gender.\n\nA more recent shift in migration, in September 2014, patterns relates to an increase in the migration of single women and partnered women who migrate without their families.\n\nMuch of the work made available to women migrants is gendered and concentrated in the entertainment industry, health services, and most of all in the domestic services.\n\nThe gendered division of labor includes reproductive labor, which refers to work performed within the domestic or private sphere and which helps to sustain a household (e.g. cleaning, cooking, childcare and rearing, etc.). Reproductive labor enables paid, productive labor to take place. Reproductive labor is typically performed by women and, as dominant gender discourses are threaded throughout labor ideologies, domestic work has historically been considered a \"natural\" part of a woman's duties and identity. As such, feminized labor has typically been considered \"unskilled\" and, thus, has gone unpaid.\n\nAs noted by Filipino popular culture studies professor Roland Tolentino, when women migrate to perform domestic labor, \"unpaid home labor in the domestic sphere becomes paid labor in international spaces\".\n\nIt has been argued that women migrants working as full-time nannies support the shift in division of labour in the First World because it becomes affordable to outsource child-care for a larger portion of families. \nAt the same time, it has been argued, the absence of the migrants working as nannies in high-income countries in their home countries create a shift of gender roles in developing countries as well.\n\nThus, both the first-world mother and the nanny are arguably outsourcing child care to someone else—the mother to the nanny and the nanny to either her husband, one of her children, or a family relative. The First World mother gives up her time as mother by going to work and paying the nanny to take care and raise the child. The mother passes on her role as mother to the nanny. At the same time, the nanny is giving up her time with her children and passing on her role to another person back in her home country. And, when a woman migrates to a First World country, she is taking on the gender role of \"breadwinner\" of the family—a role that has traditionally been the role of the man in the family, yet the restructuring of the family and globalization have started changing this ideology of the man being the main financial caretaker of the family.\n\nThose men within the familial unit are displaced as the \"breadwinner\" for their family—the migrant mothers take over this role when they leave for a First World country and send her earnings back home as remittances (Add source). This may lead to the perceived emasculation of the husband, who is left with three options:\n\nNannies leave their children back in the Third World countries, taking their love with them. The mothers (nannies) then need someone to love at the moment, therefore most usually giving their love to the closest children possible—the ones that they are nannies for. The child that is being taken care of by the nanny is also lacking someone to love because his/her parents are working during the day, and depending on the exact situation it is hard to tell how much of a parenting role they take when they get home from work.\n\nIn many cases the children in turn love the person that is most like a parent to them; the person they spend most of their time with—their nanny. Parents often become jealous of the nannies; however, they are the ones who decided to have kids, the ones that decided to pursue working jobs, and those who decided to hire a nanny. This often leads to the parents firing the nanny. Yet, most children have created a bond with their nanny, and they have come to assume that the nanny is going to be a part of their life for some time. The firing of a nanny in some cases leave a child heart-broken and the nanny as well for she has treated this child as one of her own.\nFrom studies and personal stories of family members, scholars have noted that nannies transplant their love for their own children into the children in which they take care of. It is rare for the families of nannies to migrate to the First World with them. Also, nannies do not often get to return home to visit their children—in some cases, every two or three years. Nannies still try to stay in connection with their families, and the advancements of technology and communication have made this easier to do.\n\nMost all migrant mothers are seen as \"here and there\" at the same time—nurturing her children from another country. Physical love is not present within the transnational family. Mothers cannot nurture up close and the physical love is not allowed to be transferred from two different countries. Cases have shown that many of the mothers transfer their physical love onto the children that they nanny.\n\nPower shifts among Third World families when the mother leaves the country to find enhanced and better paying work. The breadwinner holds the power within the family unit because they are the one that provides the family with (the most) monetary assets. The reason mothers of Third World countries are leaving their homes is due to the lack of well-paying jobs within their country—not only for women, but for men as well.\n\nIt is easier for mothers to move to First World countries to find work due to the increase in the need of child care and household work. These jobs that the mothers are searching for are very well paid—much better than any job in Third World countries. The women are leaving home, working at well-paid jobs, sending their wages back to their families in the Third World countries in the form of remittances, therefore becoming the member of the family that holds the most power—the power that is traditionally seen as masculine power, and the highest power (based on cultural ideology) being held by the 'man' in the family.\n\nMost fathers lose their masculine power and the children can gain more power if more responsibility is placed on them in the nonappearance of their mothers. The family should theoretically gain more power within their respected community due to the increase in wage earnings and newfound wealth due to the remittances sent by the mother—power in the sense of moving up of the social stratification \n\nThe families that outsource child care and home work are in power of their hired nanny. Those that pay for a service hold most of the power in the employee-employer relationship. The mothers and fathers have power over the nanny's day-to-day schedule, along with her employment and pay (Zdravomyslova, 218). The employers determine if the nanny is suitable for the job and if she can be trusted to occupy a place in their house and oversee the care of their child and house. They are allowed to set up cameras inside the house in order to watch the nanny's actions and the care their child is receiving.\n\nEmployers can also be in communication with their nanny at any time during the day, allocating jobs for the nanny to do. The employers decide when the nanny works and does not work, the labor that the nanny is responsible for, when the nanny is allowed to return home, and the overall stability of the nanny's job. Power is defined as control over the one that is hired in the sense of the employer-employee relationship between parents and their nannies \n\nAll nannies hold power in the employee-employer relationship. The nanny is in control of the child and its health and security, and she is the manager of the household while the employers are away. This allows the nanny to have say in the conditions of her contract with the family. Most nannies and the children under their care, after time, create bonds and become attached to one another. Some nannies use this attachment against the parents if their employment is at stake―parents not wanting to take away a stable relationship from their child, limiting the risk of abandonment issues present in the child, and the feeling of guilt felt by the parents.\n\nYoung Chinese girls are sent to cities to work in factories, where they work for low wages, and often go unpaid for a large length of time. The documentary China Blue provides insight into the treatment of these young Chinese women and the conditions under which they live. Many of the laborers are migrant workers that travel from the countryside to the city to find work, and as seen in China Blue, these workers are often underpaid, and face strict regulations in the city. The city provides legislation and/or policies stating that the factories must house them. By having dormitories onsite, the factory works like a small city. It provides food and shelter, and because the factory controls every part of the laborer's life, laborers can be forced to work late, and can be penalized for bad behavior, or not meeting their quotas.\n\nAccording to Ngai, the dormitory system is also stressful on these migrant workers as it removes them from their families. Isolation and maltreatment in the form of cheap labor is how China competes globally. China forces its workers to work long hours, subsidizes their living expenses, while keeping their wages low.\n\nRuth Pearson discusses the millions of Burmese women who migrate to Thailand each year. These women almost entirely make up the agricultural and manufacturing workforce. The Burmese who migrate are typically undocumented, and there is very little regulation of the migration. The workers, more than half of which are women, are considered disposable, and face aggression from the Thai government and police force. The Thai manufacturing and agricultural businesses are far more dependent upon the Burmese migrants due to their low pay, and the amount of work that they can demand from them.\n\nThere has been an increase of female migration within Africa. Due to all the harsh conditions Africa withstands such as starvation, poverty, and disease, these have been some of the reasons to increase the need for work. In Africa there has also been in increase in high male unemployment, which has been a factor in the increase of women working more. Since women are working more and have become the main providers for their families, they go wherever there is work. They don't always go out of the country for work, sometimes they tend to migrate within their country. The work that constantly has them moving from region to region is the agriculture and mineral deposits. Although there is work within their own country there are others that will migrate outside their region. Some places they migrate to are, but not limited to, areas in North America or even Europe. There are many jobs outside their country that they hear about that they are willing to travel to. A reason that has attracted African migrant workers to places outside their country is the demand for domestic work. \n\nThe most common work found by women migrant workers is in domestic care. In Spain, 70% of all women migrants find jobs in this sector. The increase in women migrants from Latin America is illustrated by the fact that 70% of Brazilian and Dominican migrant workers going to Spain in 2001 were women. Domestic workers are employed by private households as nannies to care for the elderly or sick family members, or as maids that provide household services. The International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates that care workers are 8% more prevalent in developing countries than developed countries. Many of these positions require that women remain with the families that hire them, which makes exploitation and abuse highly likely in these situations, given that the work is often unregulated, and there is no real way to track payment or living conditions. Furthering the issue, some of these care workers are illegally living in the United States and are undocumented.\n\nDe Parle shows through anecdote that a man from Manila was gone for twenty years to provide for his family. This man's family followed his example, and all five of his children became migrant workers. Migrant workers make about 10 times the amount of domestic wages. There is often a dramatic need that motivates these workers to move abroad. 1 in every 7 Filipinos is a migrant worker, and migrant workers are viewed as heroes as a result of their willingness to leave their families and send remittances from their pay. However, these remittances do not cover the social costs and familial costs that these workers face. For example, many children don’t recognize their parents, and grow up not knowing their closest family members. Though there are some protections for families, there is still the propensity for remittances and migrant work to have more of a negative impact on family dynamics. Though situations for children in terms of growth have improved, money is still not a replacement for their parent(s).\n\nIt has become more common for women from Sri Lanka to immigrate to the Middle East to work as domestic servants. This migration forces those in the villages of Sri Lanka to create new gender norms and ideals, going against cultural ideology.\n\nA few men reluctantly take over the work of women in their absence, and when possible, pawn this work off to female relatives. Reconstruction of gender roles occurs, creating uncomfortable situations for the men of the communities. Men have the chance to take on different roles of which they themselves choose:\n\nIn Sri Lankan communities drinking of alcohol is seen as a masculine activity. Unemployed and underemployed men take to drinking in order to still be seen as masculine and to protect their identities within the social sphere of the community. Drinking is also a sign of wealth. Creation of male groups comes out of drinking—a group of men that wish to still be seen as masculine and instead show laziness and unwillingness to provide. Men that drink spend much of their wives' remittances, making her migration of little use financially to their families. Some men find work of their own in, and outside, of the communities. These men do not give up their entire role of breadwinner; yet earn less than their migrant wives. This man is still seen as taking on a masculine role and is still considered a 'man'.\n\nVery few men take on the work of the women by taking care of the house, the preparation of food, and the care of their children. These men are looked down upon as 'not-men', therefore making them look as 'women'. This work comes with the loss of the prestige of being a 'man' and doing 'men's work'. This job is not paid and the men that do this job are not breadwinners. These men are taking on responsibility, unlike those that drink and do not work and only spend remittance money. However, they are seen as 'not-men' by others within the community. With the ability to be humbled and take on responsibility in order to provide, in other ways than the earning of money, these men are still looked down upon as failing to be a 'man'.\n\nSince the 1970s, the economic growth in East Asia has spurred workers to migrate from low-income Southeast Asian countries, like the Philippines and Indonesia, to wealthier, but typically more crowded locations, like Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan, in search of employment. As a result of globalization, women are migrating in large numbers and entering the domestic field of work, a phenomenon which scholars refer to as \"the global nanny chain\" or \"the international division of reproductive labor\".\nEconomic growth in China in particular has led many women from the rural areas of China to migrate to urban areas in search of employment. These women want to be a part of the push for the modernization of China, leaving behind the traditional practices of their rural families in favor of a chance to be a part of the modern age. This motivation, as well as the sense of duty they feel to help provide for their parents, is one of the most commonly cited reasons rural women decide to migrate to bigger cities. In order to find jobs in China's bigger cities, like Shanghai, they rely on social networks. By connecting with family members or other villagers who have already left for the city, a wide range of jobs are available. Rural women take up a wide variety of jobs, from domestic and factory work to owning their own businesses to working as hostesses in China's popular karaoke bars. These women usually spend their income on education for themselves or family members, sending any leftover money to the rest of the family that remains in the village.\n\nNot all migrant workers come from poorer regions, however. In the Philippines, for example, workers often come from more economically developed regions. Thailand has seen an increase in the migration of women from higher classes as well. Once practiced exclusively by the wealthy elite, the 1960s marked a time when middle-class Sino-Thai families began to increasingly send daughters overseas in pursuit of higher education.\n\nCheng states that there is an isolation of women who work abroad even within their own social circles. This discourages support systems, and often puts these women in heightened vulnerable positions, placing more dependency on the family structure and household where they are employed. The first year's wages are used to secure their place in their new job, and from then onward the isolation in the household keeps the women obedient.\n\nAuthors Tonya Basok and Nicola Piper discuss the global governance of international migration efforts undertaken by the non-governmental organizations trying to protect the rights of Latin Americans and those from the Caribbean, moving to Europe. They argue that although the management of trafficking the women to and from their country of origin has improved, the management of labor rights abroad is difficult due to the lack of rights promotions as opposed to management efforts.\n\nWomen who leave their homes in search of work abroad often leave their duties to another member of the family, or even their children. It is often female children or another woman who assume responsibility for maternal duties, thereby further strengthening a gendered role of domestic work, and perpetuating traditional gender roles.\n\nUNIFEM (now UN Women) is a branch of the United Nations dedicated to the support and defense of women workers. As the advent of migrant work has become more prevalent among women, UNIFEM has had to help keep their rights protected. This includes establishing a human rights standard, timely payment, rest days, medical care, and housing investigation. UNIFEM has promoted several laws similar to the law on the Protection of Migrant Women in Indonesia. Their goal is to make a universal code of ethics and treatment for all those engaging in migration for work or other reasons.\n\nGender protections in migrant work have become a necessity, given the exploitation of migrant women and the propensity of sex trafficking once they arrive in their destination country. As many women in these positions are either involved in the sex trade or domestic care, they are prone to abuse.\n\nEconomically, women enter the market to help support their family and their home in their native country. Women migrant laborers are often only skilled to work in factory or care work positions. The effect these migrant workers have on domestic and foreign economies varies, and there is too little data to make any conclusive argument regarding economic impact. However, impact can be seen through continued globalization, monetary exchange, and remittances by women. \"Remittances have had significant macro economic effects in several countries of origin in coping with trade deficits, reducing pressure on local currency, reducing external debt, etc.\" This means that a major source of capital for developing countries are the wages earned and sent home by these women. \"Formal remittance transfers of some $150 billion were reported in 2004. Possibly twice this amount was transferred informally. These financial transfers are growing in significance. In many countries, they are larger than either development assistance or foreign direct investment.\"\n\nRosewarne argues that the lack of temporary migrant laws is a hindrance to the continual flow of remittances. As well as the families that receive them, countries' GDPs are becoming dependent on the flow of these remittances. However, there are various limitations. Women traditionally have a more difficult time finding temporary employment due to their lack of education and job availability, as well as laws to support them abroad.\n\nThroughout history, women have taken on the role of a caregiver, someone who stays at home to care for the children while maintaining housework. This role while still popular among many households, has begun to change across the globe as women are taking on more male positions in the home and workforce.This change in roles has been incredibly difficult for women. They have needed to adapt to a more male physical appearance and take on the characteristics of the opposite sex, as to be taken seriously in the workforce. This change in the appearance and attitude of women has caused a shift in the way women present themselves both at work and at home. Although recently, women have chosen to adopt an assertive lifestyle rather than taking on the appearance of males in attempt to keep their femininity while maintaining seriousness in the workforce.\n\nSome women migrate in order to escape oppressive gender roles, leaving their home and obtaining increased economic independence and freedom, which challenge traditional gender roles. This can strengthen a woman's position in the family by improving her relative bargaining position. Women have more leverage in controlling the household because they have control over a degree of economic assets, depending on their economic situation. Gender roles often follow women from their rural or domestic environment to the labor they are allowed to participate in. It can have a stratifying effect on their work and social life. Jie-Yu Lui states that social roles follow migrant workers in their new environments. There is a strong connection between a woman's role in her rural life to her new life in an urban city or foreign country. Women accept the treatment they receive because it is normalized by their traditional and domestic roles, e.g. their roles at home as homemaker and houseworker.\n\nBeneria says that gender roles are ever-changing as women from Latin America are leaving their families there, and moving to be domestic care workers in Western Europe. Europeans create demand as they are focused on providing income, and have to balance their domestic duties with their market work. She uses the argument that a woman's choice to leave and provide remittances for her family initiates a role reversal for the family as a whole, in addition to a new gender category. Given that most migrant workers work in the care field, their traditional familial role is reinforced. Their absence from their homes may elicit resentful feelings from their children, but this is dependent on the presence of family. She closes by saying that the reconciliation policy is affected by the availability of migrant care workers who help balance the domestic and market work in more developed countries. If there are solutions that don't require policy changes, governments are prone to use these examples as reasons against such policy change. Additionally, there is a risk for infidelity abroad, which also erodes the family structure.\n\nMistreatment of women migrant workers is primarily due to the fact that they tend to seek employment in the informal sector, and are therefore either not covered or partially covered by the labor legislation, social security, and welfare provisions of the host country. Exploitation of women migrant workers is less identifiable than exploitation of male migrant workers because exploitation occurs at a premature stage of the migration process or in situations with weak labor inspection services. Examples of maltreatment include: not getting paid, restricted movement, removal of personal identity documents, long shifts, working for a whole week without days-off, sexual exploitation, and poor living conditions with inadequate food, water, and accommodation. Women migrant workers are often mistreated and isolated by their employers, particularly in the Middle East. Domestic workers experience this isolation, and become dependent upon their employers. They can be physically as well as psychologically abused. Dependency and work insecurity make extortion possible. Women are also raped and sexually harassed while abroad, and are vulnerable to sex trafficking.\n\nWith the trend of women migrant labor, the absence of women, mothers in particular, leaves a deficit in family life. When women leave to provide for their families, the role of mother or caretaker is left to the other female family members. These can be the eldest daughter, aunts, or even further extended family members. These kin help with domestic duties and child-rearing for the parent(s) abroad, but the absence of the parents sparks a trend and cycle within the family.\n\nChildren's education falters due to a lack of supervision and parental support. \"Despite parents' effort of remaining in touch via telephone, contact may be irregular and sometimes falls short of meaningful exchange between parent and child.\" The reunion of these families leaves children isolated from their parents, and makes the women strangers to their children.\n\nThe International Labour Organization (ILO) has provided a list of ameliorative measures that should be implemented by governments and organizations in donor, transit, and destination countries in order to improve the experiences of female and male migrant workers alike. Some of these measures include the following:\n\n\n"}

Margaret Alva, the then Central Minister was the Hon. Chairman, and K.K.Pai was the Chairman of the Organising Committee. 5000 Delegates from all over the world attended this Convention. The Convention bought together Konkani speaking people from all regions, religion, dialect and sub communities. The then Chief Minister of Karnataka H.D. Deve Gowda inaugurated the Convention. The 7 Days convention consisting of seminars, debates, cultural presentations, exhibition and food festival was a grand success. Basti Vaman Shenoy presented before the gathering of world representatives of Konkani People his dream to establish a permanent entity for the preservation and promotion of Konkani language, art and culture. The convention unanimously gave a mandate to establish World Konkani Centre in Mangalore wide a resolution in the valedictory function of the Convention.\n\nTo fulfil the mandate of establishing World Konkani Centre at Mangalore, Konkani Bhasha Mandal, Karnatak founded an organisation called Konkani Bhas Ani Sanskriti Prathistan. It came into being immediately after the World Konkani Convention in 1995 in the leadership of Basti Vaman Shenoy as its President and Eminent Banker, Philanthropist and Social Leader K.K. Pai as its Chairman. The Foundation stone, marking the beginning of construction work was laid in a ceremony in September 2005 by Eminent Philanthropist Dr. P. Dayanand Pai. The then Union Minister Oscar Fernandes and Cooperative Minister of Government of Karnataka R.V. Deshapande were present. Basti Vaman Shenoy toured relentlessly to raise funds for this mammoth project all over India and abroad. After the demise of Shri K.K.Pai, the Chairmanship of the KLCF is served by Dr. P.

The Renaissance-era architect, theorist and all-around Renaissance man, Leon Battista Alberti, recommended that when painters intend to depict a nude, they should first arrange the muscles and bones, then depict the overlying skin.\n\nSome of the first well known studies of this kind were performed by Leonardo da Vinci, who dissected cadavers and created detailed drawings of them. However, there are some accounts of this same practice taking place as far back as ancient Greece, though the specifics are not known.\n\nThe term \"écorché\", meaning literally \"flayed\", came into usage via the French Academies (such as the École des Beaux Arts) in the 19th century.\n\nAlthough there are some accounts of practices similar to \"écorché\" as far back as ancient Greece, the degree of similarity is unclear. The term as used today can be applied with the greatest confidence to the Renaissance period onwards.\n\nDuring the Renaissance in Italy, around the 1450 to 1600, the rebirth of classical Greek and Roman characteristics in art led to the studies of the human anatomy. The practice of dissecting the human body was banned for many centuries due to the belief that body and soul were inseparable. It wasn’t until the election of Pope Boniface VIII that the practice of dissection was once again allowed for observation. Many painters and artists documented and even performed the dissections themselves by taking careful observations of the human body. Among them were Leonardo da Vinci and Andreas Vesalius, two of the most influential artists in anatomical illustrations. Leonardo da Vinci, in particular, was very detailed in his studies that he was known as the “artist-anatomist” for the creation of a new science and the creative depiction to anatomy. Leonardo’s anatomical studies contributed to artistic exploration of the movement of the muscles, joints and bones. His goal was to analyze and understand the instruments behind the postures and gestures in the human body.\n\nThe study of anatomical figures became popular among the medical academies across Europe around the 17th and 18th century, especially when there was a lack of bodies available for dissections. Medical students relied on these figures because they provided a good representation of what the anatomical model looks like. The \"écorché\" (flayed) figures were made to look like the skin was removed from the body, exposing the muscles and vessels of the model. Some figures were created to strip away the layers of muscles and reveal the skeleton of the model. Many of the life-size scale écorché figures were reproduced in a smaller scale out of bronze that could be easily distributed.\n\n\"Écorché\" figures were commonly made out of many different materials: bronze, ivory, plaster, wax, or wood. By the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, wax was the most popular use of material in creating écorché statues. The production of colored wax anatomies allowed for a variety of hues and tone that makes the models appear realistic.\n\nThe \"écorché\" form of study still continues at traditional schools throughout the world including the New York Academy of Art, the Art Students League of New York, the Grand Central Academy of Art in New York City, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, and the Academy of Art University in San Francisco.\n\n"}
