The attacker was shot dead by the police after a chase along the beach promenade.\n\nThe attack happened while US Vice President Joe Biden was meeting with former Israeli President Shimon Peres in Tel Aviv. According to police, the assailant first attacked persons in the harbor and later went to a restaurant where four more persons were wounded. According to ambulance personnel, five of the victims suffered serious wounds. The attack lasted approximately 20 minutes and ended when the assailant was shot and killed by responding police.\n\nTaylor Force, age 28, graduated from the New Mexico Military Institute and from West Point in 2009 and later became an officer in the United States Army until leaving in 2014. While in the army, Force served in both Iraq and Afghanistan, participating in Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation New Dawn, and Operation Enduring Freedom. At the time of the attack Force, an MBA student, was traveling with other graduate students from Vanderbilt University Owen Graduate School of Management studying global entrepreneurship.\n\nIn addition to Force, eleven others were injured, including a pregnant woman, an Arab Israeli, and a Palestinian who was illegally residing in Israel.\n\nThe attacker was identified as 21-year-old Bashar Masalha, who was from the city of Qalqilya located in the Palestinian territories. He was residing in Israel illegally. The family of the murderer receives a monthly pension from the Palestinian Authority Martyr's Fund equal to several times the average monthly wage in the Palestinian Territories.\n\nThe Israel Defence Forces (IDF) announced on the night of the attacks that it was imposing closures on the West Bank villages of Zawiya and Al-Auja, the hometowns of two of the attackers.\n\nFollowing the attack and the two other attacks, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held security consultations with Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon, Internal Security Minister Gilad Erdan, police chief Roni Alsheikh and IDF and Shin Bet officials. The Prime Minister's Office said it was immediately decided to close gaps in the separation barrier in the Jerusalem area, and to complete construction of the barrier in the Tarqumiyah area in the South Hebron Hills. It was also decided to close Palestinian media outlets accused of incitement. Professionals in the defense establishment will decide which Palestinian media will be closed. Further, it was decided to deny work permits for family members of assailants.\n\nThe Israeli police began a law enforcement operation to crack down on Palestinian illegal residents, arresting more than 250 illegal Arabs across the country, but focused on construction sites and large shopping areas, which normally are magnets for cheap, cash-in-the-hand labor. The arresting officers discovered a small compound, complete with sleeping tents, showers, a lavatory and a kitchen, which illegal Arab workers had erected in HaBesor Stream in southern Israel, not far from the Gaza Strip. Police reported that 15 Israeli employers and 12 drivers were arrested by 10 March. According to a Knesset Internal Affairs and Environment Committee from 14 March, chaired by MK David Amsalem (Likud), out of the 73 Palestinian attacks that occurred within the Green Line, 27 were carried out by illegal Arab residents. Police noted that each year sees tens of thousands of cases of illegal Arab residents, who are brought before a judge when their stay involves security risks, which means that there are tens of thousands of illegal Arabs moving freely everywhere inside Israel, some of whom may be \"terrorist ticking bombs\".\n\nThe Taylor Force Act is a legislative bill co-sponsored in the United States Senate in 2016 by U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina), Dan Coats (R-Indiana), and Roy Blunt (R-Missouri). The legislation proposes to stop American economic aid to the Palestinian Authority until the PA changes its laws to cease paying stipends funneled through the so-called Palestinian Authority Martyr's Fund to individuals who commit acts of terrorism and to the families of deceased terrorists. On March 23, 2018 the Act was signed into law by U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was the author of the 900-page, encyclopedic \"The Oxford Companion to Food\" (1999, second edition 2006).\n\nThe son of a Scottish tax inspector, Davidson was born in Derry, Northern Ireland. His family travelled around the UK because of his father's job, but they eventually settled in Leeds, where Davidson attended Leeds Grammar School. Davidson studied classical languages at Queen's College, Oxford. During World War II, he served in the Royal Navy as an officer in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve.\n\nIn 1948, Davidson joined the Foreign Office and served in diplomatic posts in Washington, Tunis, Brussels, Cairo, the Hague; from 1973 to 1975, he was ambassador to Laos. While living in Tunis, his wife asked him to look for a cookbook on fish because she did not recognize any of the local varieties. Not being able to find one he wrote one himself together with the Italian ichthyologist Giorgio Bini, the world's greatest living authority on seafish in the Mediterranean at this time, who happened to be visiting. The original manuscript was copied with a stencil machine. A copy of \"Seafish Of Tunisia And The Central Mediterranean\" reached the British cooking guru Elizabeth David, who passed it on to Penguin Books, which published it in 1972 as \"Mediterranean Seafood\". The book has since become a standard reference work, and is characterized by its very creative mixture of biology and recipes.\n\nThis was followed by \"Seafood Of South East Asia\" (1976) and \"North Atlantic Seafood\" (1979), for which he travelled throughout the region, gathering thousands of recipes from Portugal to Iceland. He was a noted expert on Lao cuisine, which he introduced to the West through his two books, \"Traditional Recipes of Laos,\" and \"Fish and Fish Dishes of Laos.\"\n\nIn 1979, Davidson was Alistair Horne Research Fellow at St Antony's College, Oxford. In that same year he began to edit \"Petits Propos Culinaires\", a journal of food studies and history, published by Prospect Books, which he founded in 1979 for that purpose. He also convened a symposium on food history, which grew into an annual event known since 1981 as the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery.\n\nIn 2003, Davidson was awarded the Praemium Erasmianum Foundation's Erasmus Prize.\n\nOn 17 March 2010, BBC Four televised in the UK a documentary called \"The Man Who Ate Everything\", a portrait of Alan Davidson by Andrew Graham-Dixon.\n\n\n"}

The museum was able to gather and preserve all of the spiritual and material value of the Artsakh people. The museum boasts 50,000 historical-cultural artifacts, presenting the origins of birth and development of the civilization of the territory. Today more than ever the museum has the opportunity to enrich its funds effectively thanks to the archaeological excavation conducted in Artsakh and its findings. \n\nUpon entering the museum the exhibition halls start off with models demonstrating Artakh's natural landscape. Further down is the hall of archeology where models of petrification, early implements of the Stone Age, different bronze subjects (utensils, weapons, adornments), preservations from times of the state of Urartu, amazing ornamented ceramic vessels, Armenian, Roman, Persian, Arabian silver and copper coins, and so on.\n\nWhen entering the hall of the Middle Ages, the section starts off with a photo and map of the first churches in Artsakh (4th century): Amaras monastery, founded by Gregory the illuminator, the first Armenian Christian philosopher. There is also a documentary available at this part of the exhibit where evidences of his propagations in South Caucasus are presented.\n\nIn the department of ethnography the demonstrations begins with the show-case of the Artsakhian family life. Here you could see images and a diorama of a grandmother knitting with distaff while the grandfather sews leather footwear. There is also the old carpet weaving loom and the samples of Artsakh weaving art- carpets of 18-20 cc. In 19c. the center of the Armenian national culture was Shoushi city; of it the old gospel, printed books and photos tell.\n\nThe halls of modern history are rich in documentary artifacts where exhibits telling about the national liberation fight of Artsakhian Armenians against Azerbaijan in 1918–21 are demonstrated.

Her priestesses received the name of \"Melissa\" (\"bee\"). In addition, priestesses worshipping Artemis and Demeter were called \"Bees\". Appearing in tomb decorations, Mycenaean tholos tombs were shaped as beehives. The Delphic priestess is often referred to as a bee, and Pindar notes that she remained \"the Delphic bee\" long after Apollo had usurped the ancient oracle and shrine. \"The Delphic priestess in historical times chewed a laurel leaf,\" Harrison noted, \"but when she was a Bee surely she must have sought her inspiration in the honeycomb.\"\n\nThe Homeric Hymn to Apollo acknowledges that Apollo's gift of prophecy first came to him from three bee maidens, usually but doubtfully identified with the Thriae, a trinity of pre-Hellenic Aegean bee goddesses. A series of identical embossed gold plaques were recovered at Camiros in Rhodes; they date from the archaic period of Greek art in the seventh century, but the winged bee goddesses they depict must be far older.\n\nThe Kalahari Desert's San people tell of a bee that carried a mantis across a river. The exhausted bee left the mantis on a floating flower but planted a seed in the mantis's body before it died. The seed grew to become the first human.\n\nIn Egyptian mythology, bees grew from the tears of the sun god Ra when they landed on the desert sand.\nThe Baganda people of Uganda hold the legend of Kintu, the first man on earth. Save for his cow, Kintu lived alone. One day he asked permission from Ggulu, who lived in heaven, to marry his daughter Nambi. Ggulu set Kintu on a trial of five tests to pass before he would agree. For his final test Kintu was told to pick Ggulu's own cow from a stretch of cattle. Nambi aided Kintu in the final test by transforming herself into a bee, whispering into his ear to choose the one whose horn she landed upon.\n\nIn Greek Mythology, Aristaeus was the god of bee-keeping. After inadvertently causing the death of Eurydice, who stepped upon a snake while fleeing him, her nymph sisters punished him by killing every one of his bees. Witnessing the empty hives where his bees had dwelt, Aristaeus wept and consulted Proteus who advised him to give honor in memory of Eurydice by sacrificing four bulls and four cows. Upon doing so, he let them rot and from their corpses rose bees to fill his empty hives.\n\nAccording to Hittite mythology, the god of agriculture, Telipinu, went on a rampage and refused to allow anything to grow and animals would not produce offspring. The gods went in search of Telipinu only to fail. Then the goddess Hannahannah sent forth a bee to bring him back. The bee finds Telipinu, stings him and smears wax upon him. The god grew even angrier and it wasn't until the goddess Kamrusepa (or a mortal priest according to some references) uses a ritual to send his anger to the Underworld.\n\nIn Hindu mythology, Parvati was summoned by the Gods to kill the demon Arunasura, who took over the heavens and the three worlds, in the form of Bhramari Devi. To kill Arunasura, she stings him numerous times with the help of innumerable black bees emerging from her body. The Gods were finally able to take control of the heavens and the celestial worlds again. Also, the bowstring on Hindu love god Kamadeva's bow is made of sugarcane, covered in bees.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5116383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5116383", "title": "Beren and Lúthien", "text": "Beren and Lúthien\n\nThe tale of Beren and Lúthien, told in several works by J. R. R. Tolkien, is the story of the love and adventures of the mortal Man Beren and the immortal Elf-maiden Lúthien. (Early versions of the story, published in the standalone book in 2017, described Beren as a Noldorin elf.) Tolkien wrote several versions of their story, the latest in \"The Silmarillion\", and the tale is also mentioned in \"The Lord of the Rings\". The story takes place during the First Age of Middle-earth, about 6,500 years before the events of \"The Lord of the Rings\".\n\nBeren, son of Barahir, cut a Silmaril from Morgoth's crown as the bride price for Lúthien, daughter of the elf-king Thingol and Melian the Maia. He was slain by Carcharoth, the wolf of Angband, but alone of mortal Men returned from the dead. He lived then with Lúthien on Tol Galen in Ossiriand, and fought the Dwarves at Sarn Athard. He was the great-grandfather of Elrond and Elros, and thus the ancestor of the Númenórean kings. After the fulfilment of the quest of the Silmaril and Beren's death, Lúthien chose to become mortal and to share Beren's fate.\n\nThe first version of the story is \"the Tale of Tinúviel\", which was written in 1917 and published in \"The Book of Lost Tales\". During the 1920s Tolkien started to reshape the tale and to transform it into an epic poem which he called \"The Lay of Leithian\". He never finished it, leaving three of seventeen planned cantos unwritten. After his death \"The Lay of Leithian\" was published in \"The Lays of Beleriand\", together with \"The Lay of the Children of Húrin\" and several other unfinished poems. The latest version of the tale is told in prose form in one chapter of \"The Silmarillion\" and is recounted by Aragorn in \"The Fellowship of the Ring\".\n\n\"The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen\", which is told in the appendices of \"The Lord of the Rings\", served as a sequel to this story. Indeed, both Aragorn and Arwen were descendants of Beren and Lúthien.\n\nAs told in \"The Silmarillion\", the later version of the tale:\n\nBeren was the last survivor of a group of Men in Dorthonion led by his father Barahir that had still resisted Morgoth, the Dark Enemy, after the Battle of Sudden Flame, in which Morgoth had conquered much of northern Middle-earth. After the defeat of his companions he fled from peril into the elvish realm Doriath. There he met Lúthien, the only daughter of King Thingol and Melian the Maia, as she was dancing and singing in a glade. Upon seeing her Beren fell in love, for she was the fairest of all elves. She later fell in love with him as well, when he, moved by her beauty and enchanting voice, gave her the nickname \"Tinúviel\" (which means nightingale.) As Thingol disliked Beren and regarded him as being unworthy of his daughter, he set a seemingly impossible task on Beren that he had to achieve before he could marry Lúthien. Thingol asked Beren to bring him one of the Silmarils, the three hallowed jewels made by Fëanor, which Morgoth had stolen from the elves. (This was a fateful act, which involved Thingol's people in the curse of the Noldor and eventually caused the destruction of Doriath.)\n\nBeren left Doriath and set out on his quest to Angband, the enemy's fortress. Although Thingol tried to prevent it, Lúthien later followed him. On his journey to the enemy's land Beren reached Nargothrond, an Elvish stronghold, and was joined by ten warriors under the lead of King Finrod, who had sworn an oath of friendship to Beren's father. Although Fëanor's sons, Celegorm and Curufin, warned them not to take the Silmaril that they considered their own, the company was determined to accompany Beren. On their way to Angband they were seized by the servants of Sauron, despite the best efforts of Finrod to maintain their guise as Orcs, and imprisoned in Tol-in-Gaurhoth. One by one they were killed by a werewolf until only Beren and Finrod remained. When the wolf went for Beren, Finrod broke his chains and wrestled it with such fierceness that they both died.\n\nWhen she was following Beren, Lúthien was captured and brought to Nargothrond by Celegorm and Curufin. Aided by Huan, Celegorm's hound (which according to prophecy could only be defeated by the greatest werewolf ever), she was able to flee. With his aid she came to Sauron's fortress where Huan defeated the werewolves of the Enemy, Draugluin the sire of werewolves, and Sauron himself in wolf-form. Then Lúthien forced Sauron to give ownership of the tower to her. She freed the prisoners, among them Beren. Meanwhile, Sauron took the form of a vampire and fled to Taur-nu-Fuin (the former Dorthonion).\n\nBeren wanted to try his task once more alone, but Lúthien insisted on coming with him. However they were attacked by Celegorm and Curufin, who had been exiled from Nargothrond. Beren was wounded by Curufin, but Lúthien healed him. Through magic they took the shapes of the bat Thuringwethil and the wolf Draugluin that Huan had killed. Thereby they were able to enter the enemy's land and at last came to Angband and before Morgoth's throne. There Lúthien sang a magical song which made the Dark Lord and his court fall asleep; then Beren cut a Silmaril from Morgoth's crown. As he tried to cut out the others, his knife broke and a shard glanced off Morgoth's face, awakening him. As they attempted to leave, the gate was barred by Carcharoth, a giant werewolf, who was bred as an opponent to Huan. He bit off and swallowed Beren's hand, in which Beren was holding the Silmaril. Carcharoth was burned by the pure light of the Silmaril and ran off madly. Eagles then helped Beren and Lúthien escape.\n\nBeren and Lúthien returned to Doriath, where they told of their deeds and thereby softened Thingol's heart. He accepted the marriage of his daughter and the mortal Man, although Beren's task had not been fulfilled. Beren and Huan participated in the hunt for Carcharoth, who in his madness had come into Doriath and caused much destruction there. Both of them were killed by the wolf, but Carcharoth was also slain. Before he died, Beren handed the Silmaril, which was recovered from Carcharoth's belly, to Thingol.\n\nGrieving for Beren, Lúthien also died, and came to the halls of Mandos. There she sang of her ill fate, that she would never again see Beren, who as a mortal Man had passed out of the world. Thereby Mandos was moved to pity. He restored Beren and Lúthien to life and granted mortality to the Elf. Lúthien left her home and her parents and went to Ossiriand with Beren. There they dwelt for the rest of their lives, and both eventually died the death of mortal Men.\n\nAfter the recovery of the Silmaril by Beren and Lúthien, many people of Middle-earth sought to possess it, and there were wars between the Sindar, the Noldor and the Dwarves, in which the Sindar were defeated. The Silmaril was taken by Eärendil, who sailed to Valinor with it and persuaded the Valar to make war on Morgoth, which led to the latter's defeat in the War of Wrath.\n\nThe marriage of Beren and Lúthien was the first of the three unions of a mortal Man and an Elf, of which came the Half-elven, those who had both elven and human ancestry. Like Lúthien, they were given the choice of being counted among either Elves or Men. The extended edition of the live-action film \"\" would make this connection through a song Aragorn sings at night in Elvish. When questioned by Frodo, he simply explains that it relates to an Elven woman who gave up her immortality for the love of a Man.\n\nThe tale of Beren and Lúthien was regarded as the central part of his legendarium by Tolkien. The story and the characters reflect the love of Tolkien and his wife Edith. Particularly, the event when Edith danced for him in a glade with flowering hemlocks seems to have inspired his vision of the meeting of Beren and Lúthien. Also some sources indicate that Edith's family disapproved of Tolkien originally, because he was a Catholic. On Tolkien's grave, J. R. R. Tolkien is referred to as Beren and Edith is referred to as Lúthien.\n\nThe tale of Beren and Lúthien also shares an element with folktales such as the Welsh \"Culhwch and Olwen\", maybe its main literary inspiration, and the German The Devil With the Three Golden Hairs and The Griffin—namely, the disapproving parent who sets a seemingly impossible task (or tasks) for the suitor, which is then fulfilled. The hunting of Carcharoth the Wolf may be inspired by the hunting of the giant boar Twrch Trwyth in Culhwch and Olwen or other hunting legends. The quest for one of the three Silmarils from the Iron Crown of Morgoth has a close parallel in the search for the three golden hairs in the head of the Devil. The sequence in which Beren loses his hand to the Wolf may be inspired by the god Tyr and the wolf Fenrir, characters in Norse mythology. Tolkien also got inspiration from the great love story of Romeo and Juliet.\n\nThe story was published as a standalone book edited by Christopher Tolkien under the title \"Beren and Lúthien\" on 1 June 2017, being pushed back from its original publication date of 4 May 2017. The story is one of three contained within \"The Silmarillion\" that Tolkien believed warrant their own long-form narratives, the other two being \"The Children of Húrin\" and \"The Fall of Gondolin\". The book is illustrated by Alan Lee and edited by Christopher Tolkien, and it features different versions of the story, showing the development of the tale over time.\n\nIt is painstakingly restored from Tolkien's manuscripts and presented for the first time as a continuous and standalone story. The intent of the book is to extract a single narrative out of the ever-evolving materials that make up \"The Tale of Beren and Lúthien\". It does not contain every version or edit to the story, but those Christopher Tolkien believed would offer the most clarity and minimal explanation.\n\nThe book starts with the most complete version of the beginning of the tale, as told in \"The Book of Lost Tales\" (with only slight editing of character and place names to avoid confusion with later versions). The general aspect of the story has not been modified; Beren, for example, is a Gnome (Noldo), the son of Egnor bo-Rimion, rather than the human son of Barahir. (Beren's heritage switches between elf and man throughout the book, depending on which portion of the story is being told.)\n\nAs Christopher explains:\n\nFurther chapters continue the story in through later poems, summaries, and prose, showing how the story evolved over time, in order of the chronology of the story itself (not necessarily the order in which the texts were written or published). These include portions of various versions of \"The Lay of Lethian\", \"The Silmarillion\", and later chapters of \"Lost Tales\".\n\nSince J. R. R Tolkien made many changes in this story, affecting both narrative and style, the presentation in the book is not entirely consistent. There is some overlap of details (and discrepancy in continuity), but the sections attempt a complete and continuous story. Christopher Tolkien included further editorial explanations and historical details to bridge between sections. Details lost in later accounts were reintroduced: such as Tevildo (who due to the nature of his introduction is treated as a separate character, rather than an early conception of Sauron), Thû the Necromancer (treated as the first appearance of Sauron), the Wicked (or \"treacherous\") Dwarves (one of \"The Hobbit\"'s references to \"Lost Tales\"), and other terminology such as Gnome, Fay, Fairy, leprechaun, and pixie. Some of these terms appear in early editions of \"The Hobbit\", but were dropped in later writing.\n\nThe book offers an \"in-universe\" perspective for the inconsistencies, as owing to the evolution of the stories told by different perspectives and voices over time, rather than simply reflecting Tolkien's changing ideas over time.\n\nThis book reintroduces details that were omitted in the highly edited version of \"The Silmarillion's\" \"Of the Ruin of Doriath\"; it includes the cursed treasure of Mîm, and the fact that Doriath was betrayed from the inside, and that Thingol was able to push the dwarves out of the city, and that he was later killed by an ambush of dwarves. It roughly reconciles the elements of early \"Lost Tales\" with details constructed by Guy Kay for the chapter in the \"Silmarillion\", to bring it closer to J.R.R. Tolkien's intention (see The War of the Jewels).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6127054", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6127054", "title": "Blood (The X-Files)", "text": "Blood (The X-Files)\n\n\"Blood\" is the third episode of the second season of the science fiction television series \"The X-Files\". It premiered on the Fox network on September 30, 1994. The teleplay was written by Glen Morgan and James Wong from a story by Darin Morgan and was directed by David Nutter. The episode is a \"Monster-of-the-Week\" story, unconnected to the series' wider mythology. \"Blood\" earned a Nielsen household rating of 9.8, being watched by 8.7 million households in its initial broadcast. The episode received mostly positive reviews.\n\nThe show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In the episode, Mulder and Scully investigate a series of killings in Franklin, Pennsylvania. All the suspects appear compelled to murder after seeing violent messages on electronic devices.\n\n\"Blood\" was inspired by writer Glen Morgan's own hematophobia as well as controversy over malathion spraying in Southern California. The episode marked the second appearance of the Lone Gunmen in the series, as well as a guest appearance by pornographic actress Ashlyn Gere.\n\nIn Franklin, Pennsylvania, postal worker Edward Funsch (William Sanderson) is informed that he will be fired at the end of the week due to budget cuts. Afterwards, Funsch sees the words \"Kill 'Em All\" on his machine's digital display. At Franklin's civic center, a middle-aged man in a crowded elevator sees \"No Air\" displayed on the elevator's LED display, and is the only one who can see the message. Sweating and obviously claustrophobic, he again glances at the LED display. This time it flashes the words \"Can't Breathe\" and then \"Kill 'Em All.\"\n\nAgent Fox Mulder arrives at the civic center after what looks like a massacre; bodies lie on the sidewalk and in the foyer. Sheriff Spencer (John Cygan) explains that the suspect murdered four people from the elevator with his bare hands. His rampage ended when he was shot by a security guard. Spencer notes that seven other individuals have murdered twenty-two people in Franklin in the past six months. Mulder discovers that the LED display in the elevator has been damaged, and that the dead suspect has a green residue on his fingertips.\n\nAt the FBI Academy, Dana Scully reads Mulder's initial report. The only connection between the murders that he can see is that the suspects all destroyed an electronic device during the killings. Meanwhile, Bonnie McRoberts, another Franklin resident, drops by a repair shop to pick up her car, where a message on an engine diagnostic display warns her that the mechanic is going to rape her. She impulsively kills him with an oil can spout. When Mulder and Spencer question her the next morning, her kitchen microwave instructs her to kill them. When she grabs a knife and attacks Mulder, she is shot and killed by Spencer.\n\nScully performs an autopsy on McRoberts' body and discovers signs of phobia including high levels of adrenaline and the same substance found on the elevator killer. She hypothesizes that the substance, when combined with other neurochemicals, produces an LSD-like reaction. While Mulder and Scully build a case, Funsch becomes more psychotic, continuing to see violent messages on electronic gadgets. Blood is associated in some way with each incident; a volunteer asks Ed to donate blood at a department store and seconds later he sees violent images, including a video of the 1993 Waco siege burning, flash across a sales display of TV sets, followed by a message to get a gun from the sporting goods department.\n\nLate at night, while investigating an orchard, Mulder is sprayed by a crop-dusting helicopter and ends up in the hospital. There, Mulder sees the message \"Do It Now\" on a TV and realizes that when people are exposed to the pesticide, which contains a chemical called LSDM designed to provoke fear in insects, they see these subliminal messages, and their phobias are exacerbated enough to cause them to kill. Eventually, after being confronted, the city councilman agrees to stop the spraying and blood test the community under the guise of a cholesterol study. Mulder and Scully, reading that Funsch has not been tested yet, arrive at his house to find it strewn with smashed electronic devices. Mulder deduces that blood is Ed's phobia and that he has seen the subliminal messages, and an empty rifle case signals that Funsch is going to act on his paranoia. Funsch positions himself at the top of a clock tower overlooking a blood drive and begins shooting randomly. Mulder climbs up to Funsch and overpowers him; Funsch is taken away on a stretcher. Mulder makes a call to Scully and sees the message \"All done. Bye Bye\" on his cell phone display. Scully calls out to Mulder but he is speechless.\n\nThe basic premise for \"Blood\" evolved from three topics: co-writer Glen Morgan's own hematophobia, the controversy over malathion spraying in Southern California, and an embryonic idea that Morgan and his writing partner James Wong had about focusing on postal workers. After series creator Chris Carter expressed his desire to feature a story revolving around digital readouts, Morgan and Wong decided to combine their disparate influences with the digital readout idea. They ended up crafting a script that turned \"new technolog[ies]\" (e.g. fax machines and cellular phones\") into something \"scary.\" Morgan and Wong also based the episode's climax around the 1966 massacre at the University of Texas. Of note, this scene was only partially filmed at the University of British Columbia because firearms were not allowed on location at the actual university. This necessitated that a replica of its clock tower's interior be constructed for use in several key scenes. This episode marks the first time that Darin Morgan, Glen's brother, helped with an \"X-Files\" script. Darin had been asked to help flesh out the episode's story, and he would later write the second season episode \"Humbug\".\n\nThe episode features the second appearance of The Lone Gunmen, a trio of conspiracy theorists consisting of John Fitzgerald Byers (Bruce Harwood), Richard Langly (Dean Haglund) and Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood). The characters first appeared in the first season episode \"E.B.E.\" to make Mulder appear more credible. The three were initially slated to appear in only one episode, but they were brought back as recurring characters starting with \"Blood\" due to their popularity with fans of the show online. The episode also guest stars pornographic actress Ashlyn Gere, who plays Bonnie McRoberts, the woman driven to attack Mulder after seeing a subliminal message on her microwave. Glen Morgan joked that \"The X-Files\" was so cutting edge that they used an adult film star who was still working in the industry—an allusion to and jab at the \"NYPD Blue\" episode \"Tempest in a C-Cup\", which guest starred retired adult film actress Ginger Lynn.\n\n\"Blood\" premiered on the Fox network on September 30, 1994, and was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC Two on September 11, 1995. This episode earned a Nielsen rating of 9.1, with a 16 share, meaning that roughly 9.1 percent of all television-equipped households, and 16 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. It was viewed by 8.7 million households.\n\nThe episode received positive reviews from critics. \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the episode a B+, considering that despite the \"convoluted plot\" the episode \"pays off in white-knuckle tension.\" Reviewer Zack Handlen of \"The A.V. Club\" labeled the episode as a \"good\" stand-alone story. He described it as \"a memorable episode, due in no small part to its humor\", praising the \"simultaneously absurd and frightening\" story with scenes that make the viewer \"snicker even as you shudder\". In addition, Handlen praised William Sanderson's performance, as well as the ending, calling it \"the punchline [...] of Mulder's deepest fears, a group [The Syndicate] so secret that you never be sure they exist at all\". Starpulse named the episode the tenth best of the series, defining it as \"very creepy\" and what turned \"The X-Files\" \"from a mere creepfest to a show that offered real psychological thrills\". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book \"Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen\", rated the episode three stars out of five. The two wrote positively of the episode's flourishes, noting \"minute by minute, there is tons to enjoy.\" However, Shearman and Pearson argue that the premise is \"disjointed and not a little frustrating\" due to the lack of overall coherence and narrative. The plot for \"Blood\" was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 1996 by Les Martin, under the title \"Fear\".\n\n"}
{"id": "6698", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6698", "title": "Camel case", "text": "Camel case\n\nCamel case (stylized as camelCase; also known as camel caps or more formally as medial capitals) is the practice of writing compound words or phrases such that each word or abbreviation in the middle of the phrase begins with a capital letter, with no intervening spaces or punctuation. Common examples include \"iPhone\" and \"eBay\". It is also sometimes used in online usernames such as \"johnSmith\", and to make multi-word domain names more legible, for example in advertisements.\n\nCamel case is often used for variable names in computer programming. Some programming styles prefer camel case with the first letter capitalised, others not. For clarity, this article calls the two alternatives upper camel case (initial uppercase letter, also known as Pascal case) and lower camel case (initial lowercase letter). Some people and organizations, notably Microsoft, use the term \"camel case\" only for lower camel case. \"Pascal case\" means only upper camel case.\n\nCamel case is distinct from Title Case, which capitalises all words but retains the spaces between them, and from Tall Man lettering, which uses capitals to emphasize the differences between similar-looking words such as \"predniSONE\" and \"predniSOLONE\". Camel case is also distinct from snake case, which uses underscores interspersed with lowercase letters (sometimes with the first letter capitalized). The combination of \"upper camel case\" and \"snake case\" is known as \"Darwin case\". Darwin case uses underscores between words with initial uppercase letters, as in \"Sample_Type\". It has no known conventional use in computer programming but is named after Charles Darwin because of the way it has \"evolved\" from more traditional conventions.\n\nThe original name of the practice, used in media studies, grammars and the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", was \"medial capitals\". Other synonyms include:\n\n\nThe earliest known occurrence of the term \"InterCaps\" on Usenet is in an April 1990 post to the group alt.folklore.computers by Avi Rappoport. The earliest use of the name \"CamelCase\" occurs in 1995, in a post by Newton Love. Love has since said, \"With the advent of programming languages having these sorts of constructs, the humpiness of the style made me call it HumpyCase at first, before I settled on CamelCase. I had been calling it CamelCase for years. ... The citation above was just the first time I had used the name on USENET.\"\n\nThe use of medial capitals as a convention in the regular spelling of everyday texts is rare, but is used in some languages as a solution to particular problems which arise when two words or segments are combined.\n\nIn Italian, pronouns can be suffixed to verbs, and because the honorific form of second-person pronouns is capitalized, this can produce a sentence like \"non ho trovato il tempo di risponderLe\" (\"I have not found time to answer you\" - where \"Le\" means \"to you\").\n\nIn German, the medial capital letter I, called \"Binnen-I\", is sometimes used in a word like \"StudentInnen\" (\"students\") to indicate that both \"Studenten\" (\"male students\") and \"Studentinnen\" (\"female students\") are intended simultaneously. However, mid-word capitalisation does not conform to German orthography; the previous example could be correctly written using parentheses as \"Student(inn)en\", analogous to \"congress(wo)man\" in English.\n\nIn Irish, camelcase is used when an inflectional prefix is attached to a proper noun, for example (\"in Galway\"), from (\"Galway\"); (\"the Scottish person\"), from (\"Scottish person\"); and (\"to Ireland\"), from (\"Ireland\"). In recent Scots Gaelic orthography, a hyphen has been inserted: .\n\nThis convention is also used by several written Bantu languages (e.g., \"kiSwahili\", \"Swahili language\"; \"isiZulu\", \"Zulu language\") and several indigenous languages of Mexico (e.g. Nahuatl, Totonacan, Mixe–Zoque, and some Oto-Manguean languages).\n\nIn Dutch, when capitalizing the digraph \"ij\", both the letter \"I\" and the letter \"J\" are capitalized, for example in the countryname \"IJsland\".\n\nIn English, medial capitals are usually only found in Scottish or Irish \"Mac-\" or \"Mc-\" names, where for example \"MacDonald, McDonald,\" and \"Macdonald\" are common spelling variants of the same name, and in Anglo-Norman \"Fitz-\" names, where for example both \"FitzGerald\" and \"Fitzgerald\" are found.\n\nIn their English style guide \"The King's English\", first published in 1906, H. W. and F. G. Fowler suggested that medial capitals could be used in triple compound words where hyphens would cause ambiguity—the examples they give are \"KingMark-like\" (as against \"King Mark-like\") and \"Anglo-SouthAmerican\" (as against \"Anglo-South American\"). However, they described the system as \"too hopelessly contrary to use at present.\"\n\nIn the scholarly transliteration of languages written in other scripts, medial capitals are used in similar situations. For example, in transliterated Hebrew, \"ha'Ivri\" means \"the Hebrew person\" or \"the Jew\" and \"b'Yerushalayim\" means \"in Jerusalem\". In Tibetan proper names like \"rLobsang\", the \"r\" stands for a prefix glyph in the original script that functions as tone marker rather than a normal letter. Another example is \"tsIurku\", a Latin transcription of the Chechen term for the capping stone of the characteristic Medieval defensive towers of Chechenia and Ingushetia; the capital letter \"I\" here denoting a phoneme distinct from the one transcribed as \"i\".\n\nMedial capitals are traditionally used in abbreviations to reflect the capitalization that the words would have when written out in full, for example in the academic titles PhD or BSc. In German, the names of statutes are abbreviated using embedded capitals, e.g. StGB (Strafgesetzbuch) for Criminal Code, PatG (Patentgesetz) for Patent Act, BVerfG (Bundesverfassungsgericht) for Federal Constitutional Court, or the very common GmbH (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) for Company with Limited Liability. In this context, there can even be three or more \"CamelCase\" capitals, e.g. in TzBfG for Teilzeit- und Befristungsgesetz (Act on Part-Time and Limited Term Occupations). In French, camel case acronyms such as OuLiPo (1960) were favored for a time as alternatives to initialisms.\n\nCamel case is often used to transliterate initialisms into alphabets where two letters may be required to represent a single character of the original alphabet, e.g., DShK from Cyrillic ДШК. \n\nThe first systematic and widespread use of medial capitals for technical purposes was the notation for chemical formulae invented by the Swedish chemist Jacob Berzelius in 1813. To replace the multitude of naming and symbol conventions used by chemists until that time, he proposed to indicate each chemical element by a symbol of one or two letters, the first one being capitalized. The capitalization allowed formulae like \"NaCl\" to be written without spaces and still be parsed without ambiguity.\n\nBerzelius' system continues to be used, augmented with three-letter symbols such as \"Uue\" for unconfirmed or unknown elements and abbreviations for some common substituents (especially in the field of organic chemistry, for instance \"Et\" for \"ethyl-\"). This has been further extended to describe the amino acid sequences of proteins and other similar domains.\n\nSince the early 20th century, medial capitals have occasionally been used for corporate names and product trademarks, such as\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, medial capitals were adopted as a standard or alternative naming convention for multi-word identifiers in several programming languages. The precise origin of the convention in computer programming has not yet been settled. A 1954 conference proceedings occasionally informally referred to IBM's Speedcoding system as \"SpeedCo\". Christopher Strachey's paper on GPM (1965), shows a program that includes some medial capital identifiers, including \"codice_1\" and \"codice_2\".\n\nMultiple-word descriptive identifiers with embedded spaces such as codice_3 or codice_4 cannot be used in most programming languages because the spaces between the words would be parsed as delimiters between tokens. The alternative of running the words together as in codice_5 or codice_6 is difficult to understand and possibly misleading; for example, codice_6 is an English word (able to be charted).\n\nSome early programming languages, notably Lisp (1958) and COBOL (1959), addressed this problem by allowing a hyphen (\"-\") to be used between words of compound identifiers, as in \"END-OF-FILE\": Lisp because it worked well with prefix notation (a Lisp parser would not treat a hyphen in the middle of a symbol as a subtraction operator) and COBOL because its operators were individual English words. This convention remains in use in these languages, and is also common in program names entered on a command line, as in Unix.\n\nHowever, this solution was not adequate for mathematically-oriented languages such as FORTRAN (1955) and ALGOL (1958), which used the hyphen as an infix subtraction operator. These early languages instead allowed identifiers to contain unrestricted embedded spaces, determining the end of the identifier by context. This approach was abandoned in later languages due to the complexity it adds to tokenization. (FORTRAN initially restricted identifiers to no more than six characters, effectively preventing multi-word identifiers except those made of very short words, such as \"GO TO\"=\"GOTO\".)\n\nExacerbating the problem, common punched card character sets of the time were uppercase only and lacked other special characters. It was only in the late 1960s that the widespread adoption of the ASCII character set made both lowercase and the underscore character codice_8 universally available. Some languages, notably C, promptly adopted underscores as word separators, and identifiers such as codice_9 are still prevalent in C programs and libraries (as well as in later languages influenced by C, such as Perl and Python). However, some languages and programmers chose to avoid underscores—among other reasons to prevent confusing them with whitespace—and adopted camel case instead.\n\nCharles Simonyi, who worked at Xerox PARC in the 1970s and later oversaw the creation of Microsoft's Office suite of applications, invented and taught the use of Hungarian Notation, one version of which uses the lowercase letter(s) at the start of a (capitalized) variable name to denote its type. One account claims that the camel case style first became popular at Xerox PARC around 1978, with the Mesa programming language developed for the Xerox Alto computer. This machine lacked an underscore key, and the hyphen and space characters were not permitted in identifiers, leaving camel case as the only viable scheme for readable multiword names. The PARC Mesa Language Manual (1979) included a coding standard with specific rules for upper and lower camel case that was strictly followed by the Mesa libraries and the Alto operating system.\n\nThe Smalltalk language, which was developed originally on the Alto and became quite popular in the early 1980s, may have been instrumental in spreading the style outside PARC. Camel case was also used by convention for many names in the PostScript page description language (invented by Adobe Systems founder and ex-PARC scientist John Warnock), as well as for the language itself. In addition, Niklaus Wirth, the inventor of Pascal, came to appreciate camel case during a sabbatical at PARC and used it in Modula, his next programming language.\n\nWhatever its origins within the computing world, the practice spread in the 1980s and 1990s, when the advent of the personal computer exposed hacker culture to the world. Camel case then became fashionable for corporate trade names, initially in technical fields; mainstream usage was well established by 1990:\n\n\nDuring the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, the lowercase prefixes \"e\" (for \"electronic\") and \"i\" (for \"Internet\", \"information\", \"intelligent\", etc.) became quite common, giving rise to names like Apple's iMac and the eBox software platform.\n\nIn 1998, Dave Yost suggested that chemists use medial capitals to aid readability of long chemical names, e.g. write AmidoPhosphoRibosylTransferase instead of amidophosphoribosyltransferase. This usage was not widely adopted.\n\nCamelcase is sometimes used for abbreviated names of certain neighborhoods, e.g. New York City neighborhoods \"SoHo\" (\"So\"uth of \"Ho\"uston Street) and \"TriBeCa\" (\"Tri\"angle \"Be\"low \"Ca\"nal Street) and San Francisco's \"SoMa\" (\"So\"uth of \"Ma\"rket). Such usages erode quickly, so the neighborhoods are now typically rendered as \"Soho\", \"Tribeca\", and \"Soma\".\n\nInternal capitalization has also been used for other technical codes like HeLa (1983).\n\nThe use of medial caps for compound identifiers is recommended by the coding style guidelines of many organizations or software projects. For some languages (such as Mesa, Pascal, Modula, Java and Microsoft's .NET) this practice is recommended by the language developers or by authoritative manuals and has therefore become part of the language's \"culture\".\n\nStyle guidelines often distinguish between upper and lower camel case, typically specifying which variety should be used for specific kinds of entities: variables, record fields, methods, procedures, types, etc. These rules are sometimes supported by static analysis tools that check source code for adherence.\n\nThe original Hungarian notation for programming, for example, specifies that a lowercase abbreviation for the \"usage type\" (not data type) should prefix all variable names, with the remainder of the name in upper camel case; as such it is a form of lower camel case.\n\nProgramming identifiers often need to contain acronyms and initialisms that are already in uppercase, such as \"old HTML file\". By analogy with the title case rules, the natural camel case rendering would have the abbreviation all in uppercase, namely \"oldHTMLFile\". However, this approach is problematic when two acronyms occur together (e.g., \"parse DBM XML\" would become \"parseDBMXML\") or when the standard mandates lower camel case but the name begins with an abbreviation (e.g. \"SQL server\" would become \"sQLServer\"). For this reason, some programmers prefer to treat abbreviations as if they were lowercase words and write \"oldHtmlFile\", \"parseDbmXml\" or \"sqlServer\". However, this can make it harder to recognise that a given word is intended as an acronym.\n\nCamel case is used in some wiki markup languages for terms that should be automatically linked to other wiki pages. This convention was originally used in Ward Cunningham's original wiki software, WikiWikiWeb, and can be activated in most other wikis. Some wiki engines such as TiddlyWiki, Trac and PmWiki make use of it in the default settings, but usually also provide a configuration mechanism or plugin to disable it. Wikipedia formerly used camel case linking as well, but switched to explicit link markup using square brackets and many other wiki sites have done the same. Some wikis that do not use camel case linking may still use the camel case as a naming convention, such as AboutUs.\n\nThe NIEM registry requires that XML data elements use upper camel case and XML attributes use lower camel case.\n\nMost popular command-line interfaces and scripting languages cannot easily handle file names that contain embedded spaces (usually requiring the name to be put in quotes). Therefore, users of those systems often resort to camel case (or underscores, hyphens and other \"safe\" characters) for compound file names like MyJobResume.pdf.\n\nMicroblogging and social networking sites that limit the number of characters in a message are potential outlets for medial capitals. Using camel case between words reduces the number of spaces, and thus the number of characters, in a given message, allowing more content to fit into the limited space. Hashtags, especially long ones, often use camel case to maintain readability (e.g. #CollegeStudentProblems is easier to read than #collegestudentproblems).\n\nIn website URLs, spaces are percent-encoded as \"%20\", making the address longer and less human readable. By omitting spaces, camel case does not have this problem.\n\nCamel case has been criticised as negatively impacting readability due to the removal of spaces and uppercasing of every word.\n\nA 2009 study comparing snake case to camel case found that camel case identifiers could be recognised with higher accuracy among both programmers and non-programmers, and that programmers already trained in camel case were able to recognise those identifiers faster than underscored snake-case identifiers.\n\nA 2010 follow-up study, under the same conditions but using an improved measurement method with use of eye-tracking equipment, indicates: \"While results indicate no difference in accuracy between the two styles, subjects recognize identifiers in the underscore style more quickly.\"\n\n\n"}

Lengthening triggered by consonant loss may be considered an extreme form of fusion (Crowley 1997:46). Both types may arise from speakers' attempts to preserve a word's moraic count.\n\nAn example from the history of English is the lengthening of vowels that happened when the voiceless velar fricative and its palatal allophone were lost from the language. For example, in the Middle English of Chaucer's time the word \"night\" was phonemically ; later the was lost, but the was lengthened to to compensate, causing the word to be pronounced (\"neet\"). (Later the became by the Great Vowel Shift.)\n\nBoth the Germanic spirant law and the Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law show vowel lengthening compensating for the loss of a nasal.\n\nNon-rhotic forms of English have a lengthened vowel before a historical post-vocalic : in Scottish English, \"girl\" has a short followed by a light alveolar , as presumably it did in Middle English; in Southern British English, the has dropped out of the spoken form and the vowel has become a \"long schwa\" .\n\nCompensatory lengthening in Classical Hebrew and Aramaic is dependent on the class of consonant which follows the prefix (definite article in Hebrew and prefix waw-hahipukh in both languages).\n\nE.g. (using the Hebrew definite article [hey with pataḥ plus dagesh in following consonant]):\n\nCompensatory lengthening is very common in Ancient Greek. It is particularly notable in forms where \"n\" or \"nt\" comes together with \"s\", \"y\" (= ι̯), or \"i\". The development of \"nt\" + \"y\" was perhaps thus:\n\n\nForms with this type of compensatory lengthening include the nominative singular and dative plural of many participles, adjectives, and nouns, the 3rd person plural ending for present and future active of all verbs, and the 3rd person singular present of athematic verbs:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9085773", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9085773", "title": "Concrete art", "text": "Concrete art\n\nConcrete art was an art movement with a strong emphasis on geometrical abstraction. The term was first formulated by Theo van Doesburg and was then used by him in 1930 to define the difference between his vision of art and that of other abstract artists of the time. After his death in 1931, the term was further defined and popularized by Max Bill, who organized the first international exhibition in 1944 and went on to help promote the style in Latin America. The term was taken up widely after World War 2 and promoted through a number of international exhibitions and art movements.\n\nAfter the formal break up of De stijl, following the last issue of its magazine in 1928, van Doesburg began considering the creation of a new collective centered on a similar approach to abstraction. In 1929 he discussed his plans with Uruguayan painter Joaquín Torres-García, with candidates for membership of this group including Georges Vantongerloo, Constantin Brancusi, František Kupka, Piet Mondrian, Friedrich Vordemberge-Gildewart and Antoine Pevsner, among others. However, van Doesburg divided the candidates between artists whose work was still not completely abstract and those free of referentiality. As this classification entailed the possibility of a disqualification of the first group, the discussions between the two soon broke down, prompting Torres-García to team up instead with Belgian critic Michel Seuphor and form the group Cercle et Carré.\n\nFollowing this, van Doesburg proceeded to propose a rival group, \"Art Concret\", championing a geometrical abstract art closely related to the aesthetics of Neo-plasticism. In his opinion, the term ‘abstract’ as applied to art had negative connotations; in its place he preferred the more positive term ‘concrete’. Van Doesburg was eventually joined by Otto G. Carlsund, Léon Arthur Tutundjian, Jean Hélion and his fellow lodger, the typographer Marcel Wantz (1911-79), who soon left to take up a political career. In May 1930 they published a single issue of their own French-language magazine, \"Revue Art Concret\", which featured a joint manifesto, positioning them as the more radical group of abstractionists.\n\n\"BASIS OF CONCRETE PAINTING<br>\nWe say:\n\nThe group was short lived and only exhibited together on three occasions in 1930 as part of larger group exhibitions, the first being at the \"Salon des Surindépendents\" in June, followed by \"Production Paris 1930\" in Zürich, and in August the exhibition \"AC: Internationell utställning av postkubistisk konst\" (International exhibition of post-cubist art) in Stockholm, curated by Carlsund. In the catalog to the latter, Carlsund states that the group's \"programme is clear: absolute Purism. Neo-Plasticism, Purism and Constructivism combined\". Shortly before van Doesburg's death in 1931, the members of the Art Concret group still active in Paris united with the larger association Abstraction-Création.\n\nIn 1930, Michel Seuphor had defined the role of the abstract artist in the first issue of \"Cercle et Carré\". It was “to establish, on the foundations of a structure that is simple, severe and unadorned in every part, and within a basis of unconcealed narrow unity with this structure, an architecture which, using the technical means available to its period, expresses in a clear language that which is truly immanent and immutable.” The art historian Werner Haftmann traces the development of the pure abstraction proposed by Seuphor to the synthesis of Russian Constructivism and Dutch Neo-Plasticism in the Bauhaus, where painting abandoned the artificiality of representation for technological authenticity. “In close connection with architecture and engineering, art should endeavour to give form to life itself … [The former] provided new sources of inspiration as well as new materials – steel, aluminium, glass, synthetic materials.” \n\nAs van Doesburg had pointed out in his manifesto, in order to be universal, art must abandon subjectivity and find impersonal inspiration purely in the elements of which it is constructed: line, plane and color. Some later artists associated with this tendency, such as Victor Vasarély, Jean Dewasne, Mario Negro and Richard Mortensen, only came to painting after first studying science. Nevertheless, all theoretical advances seek justification in past practice, and in this case the mathematical proportions expressed in abstract form are to be identified in various art forms over millennia. Thus, argued Hartmann, “the elimination of representational images and the overt use of pure geometry do not imply a radical and definitive rejection of the great art of the past, but rather a reassertion of its eternal values stripped of their historical and social disguises.”\n\nWhile Abstraction-Création was a grouping of all modernistic tendencies, there were those within it who carried the idea of mathematically inspired art and the term ‘concrete art’ to other countries when they moved elsewhere. A key figure among them was Joaquin Torres García, who returned to South America in 1934 and mentored artists there. Some of those went on to found the group \"Arte Concreto Invención\" in Buenos Aires in 1945. Another was the designer Max Bill, who had studied at the Bauhaus in 1927-9. After returning to Switzerland, he helped organize the Allianz group to champion the ideals of Concrete Art. In 1944 he organized the first international exhibition in Basle and at the same time founded \"abstract-konkret\", the monthly bulletin of the Gallerie des Eaux Vives in Zurich. By 1960 Bill was organizing a large retrospective exhibition of Concrete Art in Zürich illustrating 50 years of its development.\n\nAbstraction, which had been quietly gathering momentum in Italy between the world wars, emerged officially in the \"Movimento d'arte concreta\" (MAC) in 1948, whose foremost exponent, Alberto Magnelli, was another past member of Abstraction-Création and had been living in France for many years. However, some seventy native painters were represented in the \"Arte astratta e concreta in Italia\" exhibition held three years later at the National Gallery in Rome. In Paris recognition of this approach resulted in several exhibitions of which the first was titled \"Art Concret\" and held at the Gallerie René Drouin during the summer of 1945. Described as \"the first major post-World War 2 exhibition of abstract art”, the artists exhibited there included the older generation of abstractionists: Jean Arp, Sophie Taeuber-Arp, Sonia Delaunay, César Domela, Otto Freundlich, Jean Gorin, Auguste Herbin, Wassily Kandinsky, Alberto Magnelli, Piet Mondrian, Antoine Pevsner and van Doesburg. In the following year a series of annual exhibitions began in the Salon des Réalités Nouvelles, which included some of these artists and were devoted, according to its articles of association, to “works of art commonly called: concrete art, non-figurative or abstract art\".\n\nIn 1951 Groupe Espace was founded in France to harmonize painting, sculpture and architecture as a single discipline. This grouped sculptors and architects with old established artists such as Sonia Delaunay and Jean Gorin and the newly emergent Jean Dewasne and Victor Vasarély. Its manifesto was published in \"L’Architecture d’Aujourd’hui\" that year and placarded on the streets of Paris, championing its aim of the harmonious development of all human activities. It extended beside into practical politics, having elected as its honorary president the Minister for Reconstruction and Urban Development, Eugène Claudius-Petit.\n\nAs time progressed, a distinction began to be made between ‘cold abstraction’, which was identified with geometric Concrete Art, and ‘warm abstraction’, which, as it moved towards the various kinds of Lyrical abstraction, reintroduced personality into art. The former eventually fed into international movements building on technological aspects championed by the pioneers of Concrete Art, emerging as optical art, kinetic art and programmatic art. The term Concrete also began to be extended to other disciplines than painting, including sculpture, photography and poetry. Justification for this was theorized in South America in the 1959 Neo-Concrete Manifesto, written by a group of artists in Rio de Janeiro who included Lygia Clark, Hélio Oiticica and Lygia Pape.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "975594", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=975594", "title": "Egg rolling", "text": "Egg rolling\n\nEgg rolling, or an Easter egg roll is a traditional game played with eggs at Easter. Different nations have different versions of the game, usually played with hard-boiled, decorated eggs.\n\nStarting in 1835, Jacob Grimm and other writers proposed that the pre-Christian Saxons had a spring goddess, Eostre, whose feast was held on the Vernal Equinox, around 21 March. Grimm also suggested that her symbolic animal was \"probably\" the spring hare, and that the egg symbolized the rebirth of the land in spring. \n\nSome claim that Pope Gregory the Great had ordered his missionaries to use old religious sites and festivals in order to absorb them into Christian rituals wherever possible. According to Grimm and his followers, the Christian celebration of the Resurrection of Christ was ideally suited to be merged with the Pagan feast of Ēostre and many of those pagan traditions were adopted into the Christian festivities. In England, Germany, and other countries, children traditionally rolled eggs down hillsides at Ēostre festivities. After mergers of celebrations, this may have become symbolic of the rolling away of the rock from Jesus Christ’s tomb before his resurrection. This tradition, along with others, such as what had become the Easter Bunny, were taken to the New World by European settlers.\n\nIn the United Kingdom the tradition of rolling decorated eggs down grassy hills goes back hundreds of years and is known as \"pace-egging\", from the Old English \"Pasch\" meaning Pesach or Passover. In Lancashire there are annual egg rolling competitions at Holcombe Hill near Ramsbottom and Avenham Park in Preston. Egg rolling has been a tradition at Avenham Park for hundreds of years, but in recent years chocolate eggs have been used. Other traditional egg rolling sites are the castle moat at Penrith, Bunkers Hill in Derby, Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh. and on Penshaw Hill in Tyne and Wear at Penshaw Monument.\n\nThe eggs traditionally were wrapped in onion skins and boiled to give them a mottled gold appearance (although today they usually are painted) and the children competed to see who could roll their egg the farthest. There is an old Lancashire legend that says the broken eggshells should be crushed carefully afterward or, they would be stolen and used as boats by witches. The eggs were eaten on Easter Sunday or given out to pace-eggers – fantastically dressed characters who processed through the streets singing traditional pace-egging songs and collecting money as a tribute before performing traditional mumming plays. At the Wordsworth museum in Grasmere there is a collection of highly-decorated eggs made for the poet’s children.\n\nIn Scotland, \"pace-eggin\" is traditional from Shetland to the Borders although the day varied with location, \"pace-egg day\" variously the prior Saturday, Easter Sunday, or Easter Monday. \"Paiss-braes\", hills, were used or other grassy slopes or areas such as seaside links. There is some variation in the spelling and pronunciation of the term \"pace\", including also \"pash\" and \"peace\".\n\nIn the United States, the Easter Egg Roll is an annual event, and is held on the White House South Lawn each Easter Monday for children (age 13 and younger) and their parents. It is hosted by the President of the United States and the First Lady of the United States.\nThe Egg Roll is a race, where children push an egg through the grass with a long-handled spoon. Surrounding events include appearances by White House personalities in Easter Bunny costumes, speeches and book-reading by cabinet secretaries, and exhibits of artistically-decorated eggs.\n\nAccording to tradition, Dolley Madison, the wife of President James Madison, began the event in 1814 and hundreds of children brought their decorated eggs to join in games. The original site was on the grounds of the United States Capitol, but in 1877 a new lawn was planted there and the gardeners cancelled the event. Congress then passed a law making it illegal to use the capitol grounds as a children's playground. \nAt the request of a number of children, including his own, then President Rutherford B. Hayes and his wife Lucy Hayes brought the event to the White House lawns in the subsequent year. From that year on, the egg roll would be an annual White House event, with the exception of 1917 (moved to the Washington Monument), 1918-1920 (canceled due to food shortages), 1942 (moved to the Capitol West Lawn), 1943-1945 (World War II), 1946-1947 (food conservation) and 1948-1952 (restoration of the White House). \n\nIn 1953 Mamie Eisenhower proposed that event be opened to black children, who were allowed to participate starting in 1954. \n\nOn 13 April 2009, the Obamas hosted their first White House Easter egg roll. The theme “Let’s go play” was meant to encourage young people to lead healthy, active lives. \n\nThe event was featured in the 2007 film \"\".\n\nIn Germany, a prize is awarded to the contestant whose egg rolls fastest down a track made of sticks. In Denmark, decorated eggs are rolled down slopes in grassland or forest - the contestant whose egg rolls farthest is the winner - and the eggs are eaten after the game (if not broken). The tradition is particularly common around the town of Køge. In Lithuania one collects those eggs that are touched by the one rolled. \n\nIn Egypt, children bowl red and yellow eggs toward another row of eggs and whoever's egg cracks one egg, may claim them all. \n\nIn eastern Europe, there are other traditions such as egg tapping and egg decorating.\n\n"}

{"id": "55455444", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55455444", "title": "History of anthropology by country", "text": "History of anthropology by country\n\nAnthropology is the study of various aspects of humans within past and present societies. This study is practiced in multiple countries, each of whom has their own history of how anthropology has developed in their respective countries.\n\nAnthropology in Latin America is a well established discipline that has existed for over 100 years. The countries that are summarized in this section include Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, the Andean region, Costa Rica, and Colombia. Latin America anthropologists established their discipline in conjunction with American and European anthropologists, and revised their disciplines to study cultural phenomena through their own perspectives, independent of American and European thought. \n\nAndean anthropology’s roots began during the turn of the 20th century, containing social movements between two groups in Peru, and from academia within the United States. The mestizo (non-native) and indigenous intellectuals known as indigenistas competed for political and intellectual space and recognition in Peru. Indigenous intellectuals advocated for interculturalidad, where indigenous thought could occupy Peruvian society as its own entity and not become blended as a singular national identity that the mestizaje proposed.\n\nThe mestizaje perspective sought to modernize Peru and model their society similar to the United States. José María Arguedas was a writer and ethnographer in Peru, who classified himself as an indigenous intellectual that challenged Western thought and ideology. John Victor Murra, an anthropologist teaching in the United States collaborated with Arguedas. Their collaboration stemmed from Murra’s travels in 1952 to the Latin American region when he was working under the anthropologist Sidney Mintz as a PhD student. Indigenistas were active in social and political movements in Latin America and collaborated with people inside of the United States, but still sought to be independent from Western thought.\n\nIn 1936, the American Anthropological Association initiated studies in Latin America on how to incorporate indigenous people in Latin American society, termed acculturation studies, and in 1935, the Social Science Research Council, the American Council of Learned Societies, and the Committee on Latin American studies worked to benefit the interests of the United States. The Peruvian government funded anthropological institutions beginning in the 1940s, and the establishment of the Instiuto de Etnologia y Arqueologia and a Peruvian sector in the Instituto Indigneista Interamericano followed. By the 1960s Peruvian governmental funding decreased, and became reliant upon the United States for funding. The indigenous incorporation into the goal of a singular society was termed cholification by the Peruvian sociologist Anibal Quijano. In the 1990s during the Neo-liberal era, indigenous thought became more recognized with political conflicts in the Andean region, and interculturalidad was pursued again for Andean states to recognize the diversity of the people that occupied them.\n\nSocial Anthropology was established in Argentina in 1957. It was first institutionalized at the University of Buenos Aires. Before the institutionalization of social anthropology, the discipline largely focused on historical studies. Rosana Guber attributes the introduction of social anthropology to Esther Hermitte who was a history professor at the Ethnographic Museum in Argentina. It was during her trips to the University of Chicago that she was introduced to social anthropology, and so it was the west who influenced the institutionalization of social anthropology in Argentina. In 1965, students began to ask for a discipline separate from sociology, and that was not focused primarily on indigenous people. There was a movement around this time that called for a greater understanding of the changes modern society was going through, especially during and after the 1966 Revolución Argentina. Later, in 1974, students and faculty within departments that were studying social movements and change suffered kidnappings and murders by the Argentine AntiCommunist Alliance. The current status of Argentinian anthropology is still deeply rooted in western influence.\n\nAnthropology in Brazil was institutionalized in 1930 at the beginning of the Vargas Era. Later during the 1950s and 1960s, Brazil was experiencing political authoritarianism. As a result, anthropology began to address inter-ethnic friction. In the 1970s anthropologists began to consider nearby urban studies as a topic of research. The 1980s kicked off a more modern type of anthropology where anthropologists began to look at themselves as “the other”. Brazil did not have an issue of alterity or exoticism, because it existed within its own borders. Brazil began to value exoticism and viewed it as the acknowledgement of cultural diversity according to . In general, the overall current goal for Brazilian anthropology was to better the future for modernization by enlightening modern political elite and identifying relevant topics for investigation. Some of Brazil’s main anthropological institutions are the University of Brazil, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, and the Brazilian Association of Anthropology.\n\nAnthropology in Colombia was institutionalized during the mid-1940s. Between the 1950s-70’s, Colombian anthropologists sought to integrate into national society and began to deal with terms like culture, integration, and assimilation. However, during the 1970s, this early understanding of anthropology was opposed and anthropologists began to confront terms such as national integration because they felt it was loaded with other issues like racial supremacy. Emerging social movements encouraged this new way of thinking because it recognized the rights of peasant and ethnic populations as well as the influence of Marxism. Anthropologists continued this way of thinking through the 1980s although a larger influence from militant anthropology became apparent. By militant anthropology, Myriam Jimeno refers to anthropologists who often debate and participate, but write very little. The goal of this type of anthropology was to alter the symbols of national identity and to accompany new ethnic movements in finding representation. Anthropologists and ethnic groups aimed to challenge the way indigenous groups were being ostracized by cultural hegemony. Later on in 1991, Colombia underwent a process of constitutional reform and development in attempt to recognize more cultural and ethnic rights. Some of its current most influential institutions are the Colombian Institute of Anthropology and History, the Colombian National University, and the National Institute of Ethnology.\n\nCosta Rican anthropology was institutionalized in 1967 under political influence. According to Margarita Bolaños Arquín, increasing notions of nationalism and anti imperialism led to the institutionalization of social sciences in Costa Rica. During the 1960s, around the time of institutionalization, social scientists' primary focus was on the birth and implications of social movements, as well as the consequences of modernization in rural areas. Later, French Structural Marxism influenced the social sciences to take an interest in the study of class structures. Over time, anthropology in Costa Rica was highly criticized in its struggle to find its identity. Caught in a sort of balancing act between western and Latin American practice, anthropology in Costa Rica eventually learned to take the criticisms of other anthropologies and made a name for itself with a focus on gender studies, identity studies, and developmental problems. To legitimize their discipline, anthropology contributed to other sciences such as linguistics, agriculture, and psychology. However, during the 1980s Costa Rica endured a recession, and anthropological institutions were under threat. During this time, globalization was becoming increasingly popular and while during the recession of the 1980s Costa Rica was not seen as a power player, at the start of the 1990s, the country could now participate in ways that were productive. It was not until around the 1990s that anthropologists regained the opportunity to research and, after such political and economic turmoil, there was much to question. Throughout the 1990s the focus of anthropology and other disciplines such as sociology continued to research in rural areas but shifted their research to the survival of the poor during tough economic times.\n\nManuel Gamio, the first Mexican anthropologist, earned his PhD in 1921, having studied under Franz Boas. The first anthropology department was established in 1938. Indigenous population studies known as indigenism, are an integral part of Mexican anthropology, and became popular during the presidency of Lázaro Cardenas, serving from 1934-1940. The National Institute of Anthropology and History was established by President Lázaro Cárdenas in 1939, and remains a prominent place of anthropological study in Latin America. The nation-building interests of incorporating the indigenous population into the Mexican state also led to the establishment of the Inter-American Indian Institute in 1942, in Mexico City, along with the establishment of the academic journal, America Indígena. Marxist theory was predominantly used to analyze social phenomena, and was combined with social evolution theory that viewed Mexico in three historical time phases: pre-Hispanic, Colonial, and Modern.\n\nIn the 1970s, Gonzalo Aguirre Beltrán, an anthropologist who was formerly a medical doctor worked for the federal government and promoted critical anthropology in Mexico that used Marxist theory and rejected imperialistic practices from the United States. Mexico’s urban populations began to increase in the 1970s, which became another topic of study for anthropologists. In the 1980s, Gramscian Marxism became the theoretical center, and studies included rural and urban populations, and labor. Institutions of anthropology have continued to increase since the 1980s, offering undergraduate and graduate degrees. Neo-liberal market transformations in the 1990s have affected anthropological training presently, as students may find careers not only in the universities, but non-governmental organizations.\n\nAsia includes the countries China, Japan, Philippines, and Siberia. Anthropology in Asia has been influenced by Western anthropological ideologies through colonial contact, historically. While the discipline of anthropology is historically built from nation-building and colonization from core countries, language and publishing barriers, funding opportunities and political status all influence the structure of anthropological research in each Asian country. Anthropology in the social and cultural perspective have not always had a strong tradition in Asian anthropology, but ethnography, ethnology, and folklore often have dominant roots within the discipline.\n\nChinese anthropology was founded by scholar Cai Yuanpei. Cai Yuanpei was a scholar educated at the University of Leipzig, and he brought both Western influence and standardization into the discipline of anthropology in China. The first department of anthropology was founded in 1928 with Cai Yuanpei’s creation of Academia Sinica in Beijing. At Academia Sinica, physical anthropology and archaeology held focus.\n\nFranz Boas also brought Western influence to China, and British functionalism would make a lasting impact on Chinese anthropology. In addition to Cai Yuanpei, Wu Wenzao was one of the most influential proponents of Western-influenced anthropology, and he took classes under Ruth Benedict (one of Boas’ students that would be influential in the field of anthropology on her own overall). Wu began teaching at Yenjing University in 1929, where he would influence students such as Fei Xiaotong and Lin Yaohua, who would go on to be important in the scene of Chinese anthropology. Chinese Ethnological Association created in 1934, but its progress was halted by China’s involvement in World War II in 1937.\n\nWorld War II pushed back the institutional development of anthropology in China until the late 1940s. With this revitalization, Chinese anthropologists began to look inwards at themselves for subjects of study. This inward focus led anthropologists of the time to attempt to use anthropology to better Chinese society. 1940-late 1950s was a time of Soviet influence in China, followed by 1957-1977 and Mao Zedong’s era of the People's Republic of China. During this time, Maoist aims supplemented ethnology and Chinese national identity creation.\n\nPost-1978 was a time of reform in China following the end of Mao Zedong's leadership. Academia was reconstructed, and anthropology subsequently saw a revival during this time. Exchanges between foreign faculty and students helped to globalize Chinese anthropology and bring in other perspectives. Liang Zhaotong was an advocate for the revival of social and cultural anthropology, but for this to happen, anthropology had to be seen as a useful tool for improvements in the field of the social sciences and society. Anthropology was held in lower regard than ethnology in China due to the ideology of Mao Zedong, and anthropologists left anthropology for other disciplines in social science, such as sociology, which subsequently saw a large period of development in the 1980s. This lower regard for anthropology also caused the field to receive less attention and less funding from the public and Chinese institutions.\n\nThe Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) and the State Education Committee founded the Chinese Anthropological Association in 1981 (now part of the East Asian Anthropological Association). Today, anthropology in China is still influenced by its history of being less practical and less important in the field of social sciences. This causes a lack of public interest and awareness in Chinese anthropology in favor of more “professional” disciplines, such as medicine, business, law, etc.\n\nThe creation of anthropology in Japan was a response to the research of Edward Morse, the first professor of Zoology at Tokyo Imperial University, where he discovered signs of cannibalism in Japan. Japanese nationalism motivated Japanese peoples to study themselves rather than being subjects of study by outsiders. This motivation led to the formation of Anthropological Society of Tokyo in 1886. Tsuboi Shôgorô was a leading member of this group, and he is named one of the founding fathers of Japanese anthropology. In 1892, he became the first professor of anthropology at Tokyo Imperial University.\n\nIn 1895, the Japanese colonial empire was marked by the annexation of Taiwan and led to an increase in domestic ethnographers in this region. Torii Ryūzō was Tsuboi's successor and greatly attributed data and photographs of Taiwan during this time period. His own research abroad redirected peoples' focus from themselves, Japanese folklore-studies, to the colonial Others. The expansion Japanese imperialism drove Ryūzō's research of others. This shift in research subjects created a separate discipline, ethnology or 'race studies.'\n\nIn 1934, Japanese Society of Ethnology (\"Nihon Minzokugakkai\") was formed, which separated Japanese folklore and ethnological studies from comparative ethnology.\n\nIn 1968, the Eighth Congress of the International Union of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences (IUAES) was held in Japan.\n\nIn 2004, in response to the IUAES, the Japanese Society of Ethnology changed its name to the Japanese Society of Cultural Anthropology; this is one of the largest organizations at 2,000 members.\n\nConsidered to be a semi-peripheral country in comparison to the West, Japan is home to the largest number of anthropologists in Asia as well as the largest center for anthropological research in Asia. Japan's history resembles a colonial power in East Asia. Currently, language and audience discrepancies hinder open conversations between Japanese and American anthropologies. Since Western academic anthropologists publish in English, their local and global audience is essentially one. In Japan, writing for a global audience requires publishing in English. While Japanese scholars are knowledgeable about Western anthropological theories and trends, institutional factors deter Japanese anthropologists to publish in English; a more extensive peer review process can delay publication approval for years resulting in outdated empirical data. Japanese academics prefer to publish in university in-house journals where there is a much shorter delay in publication approval. A local audience means publishing in Japanese and increasing the gap between world anthropologies.\n\nThe movement of indigenization of anthropology in the Philippines challenges foreign-adopted Western concepts, theories and methods. To understand the viewpoints of this process, indigenization can be examined as a historical process, a perspective of native concepts, and as both a problem and solution created by colonial or neocolonial educational curriculum.\n\nFrom 1560-1898, the Philippines was under Spanish colonial regime. During this time, Spanish colonizers established society through theologoical orthodoxy. They valued their own written history over the Philippines' native traditions, and oral tradition was undermined by colonization.\n\nFrom 1898-1941, the second period of colonization by the United States took place. Ethnographic knowledge was established as the basis of integration of indigenous elements into mainstream Philippine society. In 1914, anthropology curriculum was established at the University of the Philippines, and three years later, an anthropology department was created. In 1921, the anthropology department at the University of Philippines merged with the sociology department.\n\nDuring the post-war era (1946-1968), student activism, national pride and identity reinforced the process of decolonization; the University of the Philippines was at the forefront of this movement. Filipino scholars increasingly pursued graduate programs in the United States anthropology departments. This created an issue that will be discussed further.\n\nFrom 1970-1986, social and political consciousness in the Philippines marked a revolutionary period. The country adopted conflict models; Marxist ideology was more suitable for the Philippines that was in a crisis state. In the late 1970s, the Philippine Folklore Society was formed. This growth of folklore studies was due to the further development of indigenization in the Philippines. In 1977, The Philippine Anthropological Society (Ugnayan ng Agham Tao or UGAT) was founded.\n\nAfter 1986, this period was marked by a heightened cultural consciousness. President Corazon Aquino promoted culture through creation of the National Commission for Culture and Arts (NCCA).\n\nThe distance between native and foreign anthropologists is a conflict in the Philippines. While most scholars receive formal education in Western societies, they often return \"home\" and view their native society through a foreign, Westernized lens they were conditioned and educated by. Native anthropologists are hindered by a perspective based on bias. Interests, training, values, and field exposure can result in differences between foreign and native anthropologists. It is important to recognize these different angles, politics of representation, and ethnographic authority in order to successful observe others as well as our own societies. Another challenge in anthropology in the Philippines is discussed by Filipino anthropologist, Carlos Jr. P Tatel, about funding for research on governmental and regional levels. He explains that anthropology proposals for funding often deviate from original plan in order to fit the agendas of agencies who grant travel and research funding.\n\nSiberia as a territory was important in the development of Russian anthropology due to its position of alterity within Russia. Siberia and the people of Northern Russia were points of great interest throughout various periods in Russian history as it tried to better understand its own people.\n\nThe beginnings of ethnographic research in Siberia were heavily influenced by anthropology in Germany and ideas of Russian nationalism in the 19th century. The expedition led by Franz Boas, the Jesup North Pacific Expedition from 1897-1902, helped to bring international attention to the concept of doing anthropology in Siberia in relation to Russian anthropology in addition to bringing Boas’ anthropological perspective into Russia. Also on this expedition were Vladimir Bogoraz, Vladimir Jochelson, and Leo Sternberg, who would be known as the founding fathers of Siberian studies, and influential ethnographers in Russia.\n\nThe nationalistic undercurrent in Russia at the time of the beginnings of researching Siberia as a place of intrigue was reflected in the Russians' attitude towards the people in Siberia. The impetus to study Siberians was rooted in the idea that one day the people in the area would all assimilate to Russian culture, and due to this, the current culture of the people should be documented and recorded. Russian ideologies heavily influenced the research field in Siberia, and studying Russian and Siberian history was an easier route for research due to the uncertainty of what would be acceptable to study under the Russian government in the 19th and 20th centuries. Under Soviet Russia in the early 20th century, ethnology moved toward a more lstructural and functionalist view, with the goal of generally understanding human culture. When Joseph Stalin came into power, this view shifted as Stalin aimed to homogenize Russian culture and identity. Ethnologists were employed by the state with a focus on understanding, regulating, and standardizing the different ethnic groups of Russia.\n\nCentral and Eastern Europe includes the countries of Austria, Croatia, Slovenia, Switzerland, Belarus, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, and Hungary among many others. Anthropological study is active in many places Europe through research centers, academic societies, and universities on a range of topics. One of the biggest problems facing anthropologists in Central and Eastern Europe is the need to define themselves as a discipline separate from any other.\n\nAnthropology in central European countries has its roots in Germany. The establishment of anthropology within central Europe has been a slow process that involved first understanding what the discipline was and then determining how it fit within each country's individual ideals.\n\nAustrian anthropology has close ties to Germany and is generally intertwined with German-speaking countries. As such, the history of anthropology in Austria is foggy until the marked institutionalization of the discipline. The Anthropological Society in Vienna (ASV) was the first anthropological institution in Austria. It was established on February 13, 1870 and is a non-profit organization. The “new anthropology” approach was the ASV’s foundation and Bernd Weiler’s term for anthropology that existed post-publication of Charles Darwin’s \"On the Origin of Species\". Anthropology within academia was postponed until 1919 when the Institute of Anthropology and Ethnography was created at the University of Vienna. The institute was divided into two later, making the Anthropological Institute and Institute for Ethnology. In 2005, the Anthropological Institute became the Department of Anthropology and is the only anthropology department that exists within the country.\n\nA notable anthropologist is Richard Thurnwald who was an Austrian-born German anthropologist and sociologist. He was multilingual in Arabic, Turkish, Serbian, and Russian and a professor at universities in the United States and Germany during the early 1900s Thurnwald was also the editor of various journals, including the one he originated, called Journal of Popular Psychology and Sociology, which was later renamed Sociologus. His wife continued publishing the journal despite his death in 1954. His work included the study of kinship, social structure, superstratification, feudalism, kingship, cities, and states, and western colonial expansion.\n\nAnother important figure was Pater Wilhelm Schmidt who was a German-born ordained Roman Catholic priest, anthropologist, and linguist. Anthropos is a journal he created in 1906 and the Anthropos Institute is an institution he founded in 1931. He relocated both to Switzerland in 1938 due to his distaste for Hitler's ideals. He was a professor at the Universities of Vienna and Freiburg, had published extensively, and his research topics included family, religion, language, and culture.\n\nKarl Franzens University of Graz’s humanities department includes the Institute for Cultural Anthropology and European Ethnology which offers bachelors, masters, and doctoral degrees in Anthropology. The key topics of research the institution is involved in include “city, governmentality, limit and difference, mobilities, visual culture, material culture, museum, religiousness, and science research as well as subject-oriented methodologies.” \n\nWeltmuseum Wien is an ethnographic museum located in Vienna that serves to display cultural diversity. Weltmuseum Wien, translated ‘World Museum Vienna’, opened in 1928 and houses worldwide artifacts, not including Europe, from as early as the 1500s. The museum’s previous title was the Museum of Ethnology and it recently reopened after closing for renovations in 2014.\n\nCroatian anthropology started with a focus more on natural and medical topics because it wasn’t embraced as a human-centered scientific discipline. In 1973, various European anthropologists met for the first time to discuss the making of a European Association for Anthropology. It wasn’t until the fourth meeting in Zagreb, on October 7, 1976, that the board members established the European Anthropological Association. The initial meeting triggered a chain reaction development of anthropology within Croatia because, meanwhile, in 1974, the Croatian Physicians Assembly established the section for biological anthropology. Soon after, the Croatian Anthropological Society was created in 1977 along with its journal, titled \"Collegium Antropologicum\". Finally, in 1992, the Institute for Anthropological Research was established at the University of Zagreb.\n\nAnthropology in Slovenia has been greatly influenced by surrounding nations due to the country's small size. There was a shift in language after World War II that caused German language to be controversial so English began being taught to children which later resulted in students being more interested in an ethnographic college curriculum. The University of Ljubljana started offering anthropology courses in 1933 which were taught by Božo Škerlj as the first college professor to teach the subject in Slovenia. Later, he created a chair in anthropology at the University of Ljubljana in 1946 that was eventually placed within the biology department; but, within a few years of his death in 1961, the subject became questioned which resulted in its being terminated. However, social anthropology was already part of the sociology curriculum which was established earlier in the 1960s. It wasn't until the 1990s that this branch of anthropology became an official program offered to graduate students.\n\nBožo Škerlj was an Austrian-born anthropologist who studied physical anthropology in Prague. He was initially interested in German physical anthropology but, at the time of World War II, decided to focus on cultural anthropology instead. His work reflected a combination of the two topics.\n\nAnother important figure in Slovene anthropology is Niko Županić who was born in 1876. He was the creator of the Slovene Ethnographic Museum, which opened in 1923, and the museum’s corresponding journal, \"Etnolog\", that began in 1926. His educational background was in physical anthropology, archaeology, and history and, in 1940, he became a professor for the ethnology and ethnography department at the University of Ljubljana. Niko Županić died on September 11, 1961.\n\nThe Slovene Anthropological Society has been active since its founding in 1992 and arranges an international science conference every three years called Škerlj's days. The society's journal is named Anthropological Notebooks. The articles inside are preferred to be unique to the journal and they're published in English language.\n\nThe discipline of anthropology in Switzerland, like Austria, is closely tied to Germany and German-speaking countries in general. Swiss anthropology originated with studying folklore, also known as volkskunde, and ethnology, or völkerkunde. Between 1912 and 1916, ethnographic museums held seminars in ethnology and folklore and were the beginning of anthropology being taught in Switzerland.\n\nJohann Jakob Bachofen, born in 1815, was a professor at the University of Basel, criminal court judge, member of city legislative council, and an anthropological writer. He came from a wealthy family and was well educated in law, Philology, history and ancient history. A popular, influential publication of his, titled Das Mutterrecht, explored past societies with the idea that matriarchy came before patriarchy. Initially it was rejected but was later printed in 1861. Bachofen published many works but none were accepted until well after his death in 1887.\n\nAnthropology in Eastern Europe varies in is roots, but many of the different anthropologies share a common interest in folklore and human populations. Eastern European anthropologists, official and non official, tend to focus on studying local issues and staying out of international affairs. The anthropological trend in Eastern Europe is a turn toward the social sciences and anthropology after separation from the Soviet Union.\n\nThe first Belarus postgraduate training program with anthropology was in February 1965 and was at the Institute of Art, Ethnography and Folklore of the Academy of Sciences of the BSSR.\n\nAfter separating from the Soviet Union, Belarus went through a period of state development that lasted from about 1990 to 1994. During this time, the focus was on nation-building. This required both an institutional and ideological change from the time when Belarus was under Soviet rule. A policy of “Belarusisation” was implemented in order to bring back culture and language that was understood to be native to Belarus. In 1971, anthropological research focused on the characteristics of populations within Belarus, looking at perceived internal “others”. In the 1980s, anthropologists were looking at the genetic structure of human populations based on demographics and environment, along with a study of Belarus’s child population. Belarusian anthropologists also looked outside of Belarus through the Research Institute and Museum of Anthropology from Moscow State University in order to study the Chukchi, Eskimos, Kazakhs, and Khakas peoples.\n\nOne important figure in Belarusian anthropology was L.I. Tegako, who is cited as being one of its founders in the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus. She began research on ethnic health issues in the 1960s, which is one of the first instances of an official sort of anthropology in Belarus. Her teacher was V.P. Alekseev of Russia. From her research, she concluded that “Belarusians manage to stay within variations which are typical for Caucasian race.” Tegako took part in much of the work in the 1980s on both the genetic structure of human populations and the child studies. She also led twenty expeditions outside of Belarus.\n\nLidiya Ivanovana is also an important character in Belarusian anthropology. She obtained her PhD in Russia in 1990 with a dissertation that looked at populations in Belarus. Her work was the first to take a multi-dimensional approach involving different types of materials from several different populations within Belarus. Ivanovana is attributed as having contributed many of the anthropological methods used in Belarus.\n\nAnthropology appeared in an official status in Bulgaria in late 1989 due to the fall of the communist regime and is thought to be a product of democratization of society. The first departments to include something like anthropology were departments of ethnology, which were concerned with ethnography and folklore, and were worked in to the departments of philology or history. Anthropology itself was introduced at New Bulgarian University (NBU) as a priority, but they had to combine with a discipline recognized by the state, which like in many other cases, was the department of sociology with the degree being a sociology one. It wasn’t until around 2004 that anthropology got its own department with its own degree in Bulgaria.\n\nOne of Bulgarian anthropology’s main focuses at first was to carve out their own niche as a discipline, especially considering that Bulgarian anthropologists come from a variety of backgrounds. They were also left with ideas from the socialist period and the fall of communism. There was also focus on the changing social conditions from the period of transition after the fall of communism. There was push for democratization in Bulgaria, and anthropology became something of a symbol for that change. Despite this, there was still polarization on methods and ideology within the new discipline based on debates about Soviet versus Western styles of education, which were understood to be ideological opposites. The shift was eventually toward Western ideas. Bulgarian anthropologists tend to focus on research within their own borders, but also research in Balkans. Despite the branching out of Bulgaria, there are a limited number of field-research sites, a limited number of subjects, and a limited number of methods taken advantage of by Bulgarian anthropologists. Much attention is paid to community formation, complex societies, power, polity, statehood, nationalism, myth, ritual, religion, marriage, kinship, ethnicity, nation-hood, magic, medicine, and multiculturality.\n\nThe Czech Republic takes a constructivist approach to anthropology (closely connected to ethnology), which they take a positivist approach to. Ethnology is taken to be trying to get at objective truth, where anthropology is getting at social constructs and beliefs. Despite this split between ideas of ethnology and anthropology in the Czech Republic, anthropology is not yet a fully established discipline. After the split from communism in 1989, there was a turn to socio-cultural anthropology in the way of ideology, but it was inconsistent. Some academics saw it as the same thing as ethnology, while others thought of it as a different research field with different methods and traditions, which resulted in the difficulty of establishing anthropology as a discipline. Many argue for there being a real epistemological difference between the two approaches.\n\nHungarian anthropology is a defined discipline with its own departments and methods, though there is still overlap between anthropology and other related departments, like history and sociology. Hungarian anthropology places a premium on verifying sociological and anthropological results with scientific data.\n\nIn 1963, the \"Ethnographic Research Group\", which was attached to the Hungarian Academy of Sciences was founded. It was led by Gyula Ortutay and had twenty-two participating members. The research focused on Hungarian folklore, but the group also looked at peasant economy, social institutions, and Siberian tribal society. If a senior member had an interest outside of Hungary, then that was also a permissible research topic. Cultural Anthropological departments were established at the University of Budapest in 1990 and the University of Miskolc in 1993.\n\nThere are many places to publish anthropological works within Hungary. The majority of the work is published in languages other than Hungarian and appear mostly in European periodicals. Many of the works do not appear in American anthropological journals due to a gap in how things are understood between the two anthropological fields. Many Hungarian anthropologists believe that the methods and problems that they need to consider are within their own borders or within their own region. They tend to stay out of international problems and direct their funding toward internal concerns.\n\nBela C. Maday points out that communication is not a strong suit for Hungarian anthropologists, which makes communicating ideas with core anthropologists, like those from the U.S. or Western Europe, difficult, but there has been much dispute on this point.\n\nThe beginnings of anthropology in Russia can be traced back to the establishment of the Russian Academy of Sciences under Peter the Great in 1725. Following the Academy of Sciences, many museums were also created with the impetus for studying culture, including the Ethnographic Bureau of the Russian Geographical Society in the mid-19th century. The 1840s also saw the creation of physical anthropology and archaeology as sub-disciplines of anthropology. In 1864 the first university department for anthropology in Russia was created at Moscow University. The first specialized journal for Russian anthropology, (trans.) The Ethnographic Review (Etnograficheskoe obozrenie), was created in 1889. As Russia did not have state-supplemented funding in the 19th century, much of the financial support came from aristocrats such as Count Aleksey Uvarov and Prince V. N. Tenishev.\n\nIn the early 20th century, St. Petersburg and Moscow would be centers for the development of anthropology—focused on ethnology and ethnography—with the formation of the Department of Ethnology in Leningrad (1928), Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography (1924), the publication of the journal \"Ethnography\" (1926), the Anuchin Institute of Anthropology at the University of Moscow (1922), etc. Anthropology in Russia was also influenced by Western anthropological perspectives, such as Franz Boas.\n\nFollowing the Communist Party takeover, Russia began to favor ethnology over anthropology. Ethnology was the study of different ethnic groups within the state, which supported the push for homogenization and national unification of the Russian state. Marxist theory replaced Western anthropological theory, and various university departments were closed as Russia experienced an ideological reconstruction. In the mid-20th century, with undercurrents of the Cold War, social and cultural anthropology were rejected from ethnographic study, but ethnography was re-institutionalized and strengthened in universities and institutions across Russia.\n\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, Russian ethnography to other parts of the world in which Soviet influence was strong, such as Eastern Europe. The Perestroika in 1985 led to another bout of reconstruction for anthropology, and Russian science in general. Institutes were renamed and reconfigured to match this new trend. Social anthropology also began to make a comeback, leading to identity problems for social anthropology as a discipline in a country with such a strong ethnographic tradition that had excluded it for years.\n\nThe 1990s, a time of great social and political change for Russia with the end of the USSR, were a time for critical introspective views on the recent past. With this, Russian anthropology turned towards more contemporary interests, where it still is today. Even with these contemporary interests, Russian anthropology still finds itself heavily influenced by the ethnology of its past and attempting to reconcile what it means to be a “social” anthropologist in this environment.\n\nThe discipline of anthropology is not new to the Arab world. While there were no established anthropological institutions until the 20th century, scholars such as Abu Rayhan al-Biruni and Ibn Khaldun, are recognized for their contribution to the discipline as early as the 10th century. Egypt, Palestine, and the Persian Gulf region have received most of the scholarly attention, with a particular focus on nationalism and the state. The Arab youth are a growing area of interest for anthropologists in the Arab world. Comparatively little research is done in Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, the Sudan, Syria, Jordan, and Iraq. This is in part a result of accessibility and the conditions of the states. That status of anthropology in the Arab world would be labeled as peripheral in relation to anthropology in other regions of the world.\n\nThe man known as the father of Iranian Anthropology was named Sadegh Hedayat (1903-1951). His focus was on folklore. In 1937, an institute of ethnology was founded in Iran, which then closed in 1941. It then reopened with the rise to power of Mohammed Reza Shah. From 1956 to 1959, it published a journal titled \"Majalle-ye Mardomshenasi\" (Journal of Anthropology). In 1957, the first anthropological elective course offered at a college level in Iran began at the University of Tehran.\n\nIn the past, there was not as much of an emphasis placed on receiving degrees from foreign universities. Similarly, international research was also not highly valued. International study and research, however, has begun gaining more and more importance within the departments of anthropology in Iran. Anthropology in Iran suffers from a poor reputation in the public sphere. It is considered to be a weak discipline, according to Iranian anthropologist, Soheila Shahshahani. Perhaps because of this, most students of the social sciences tend to choose other disciplines, such as law, management, and psychology. As society changes, more attention is being paid to the field. Today, ethnographic research in the area focused on internal subjects, such as the pastoralists living in the arid areas around Iran. These studies continue today, but other fields of interest have started to emerge. A new focus on small town life and rural areas has recently developed. Professor Shahshanani states that the weakness of current anthology in Iran is the lack of theoretical work done by its practitioners. She also goes on to say that these issues could be solved by getting Iranian anthropologists who have trained elsewhere to come back and practice in Iran.\n\nThe department of sociology at the American University of Beirut was the first to offer an anthropology course, which is listed in its 1950-51 catalogue. The department of anthropology was officially founded in the 1970s, and saw 33 students graduate with a Master of Arts degree in anthropology throughout that decade. The Lebanese Civil War, which lasted from 1975-1990, interfered with the development of the department and anthropology at the university saw a decline as a direct result. During this time, the new department of social and behavioral sciences (SBS) which already encompassed sociology, psychology, and communication, absorbed the anthropology department.\n\nDuring the 1980s, records show just one student having graduated with a Master of Arts degree in anthropology, while there were none in the 1990s. There were three anthropologists on the faculty throughout this time. Among them were Fuad Khuri, Martha Mundy, and Gerald Obermeyer.\n\nA survey conducted in 1989 by Seteney Shami, a 1976 graduate of the BA program in anthropology at the American University in Beirut, sought to learn more about the teachings of anthropology at universities in the Arab world. Her findings suggested that the role of the discipline in the Arab world were minimal. In an academic report that came out in 2006, anthropologists at the same university claim to have found little evidence in the local community of any significant changes since.\n\nToday's anthropology graduates in Lebanon have opportunities to work with local NGOs. However, for those interested in pursuing anthropology as a discipline, the West still stands as the one destination for that. Anthropology departments at the American University in Beirut, and in Lebanon, are stifled by war.\n\nAs a destination for anthropologists to do research, Lebanon is among the top spots for emerging scholars in the Arab world.\n\nPalestine has seen an increase in research conducted in the territory and among the Paletinian communities in Isarel, as well as refugee camps in neighboring countries.\n\nThe history of Palestinian anthropology can be marked by four modes of ethnographic engagement: Biblical Palestine, Oriental Palestine, Absent Palestine, and Post-Structural Palestine.\n\nBiblical Palestine refers to the main method of ethnographic engagement of Palestine which took place in the first decades of the 20th century. Led predominately by Europeans, their interest was motivated by the use of the Bible as a legitimizing text to influence the region. Early work consisted of European writers fetishizing and romanticizing the land and the people based on the Biblical figures.\n\nOriental Palestine, a term coined by a Palestinian scholar (find scholar, cite) was the leading mode of engagement throughout the first four decades of the 20th century. It was marked by a sense of urgency to document Palestine as a source of Europe's beginnings. Through this lens, a narrative was offered that challenged the colonial British vision of Palestinian history which saw the Arabs there as \"transient and ephemeral\". It was also marked by a sense of duty among others to capture the traditional fabric of Palestine before it's dissolution, which appeared evident at the time due to the events surrounding the rise of Zionism.\n\nAbsent Palestine follows immediately after the demise of Palestine in 1948, and can only be fully understood in terms of the success of Zionism. In this sense, the state of Palestine was eclipsed by the narrative of Israel as a place offering a safe haven to endangered refugees from Europe. This ethnographic silence of Palestinians is seen as the turning point in Israel's image of modernity.\n\nPost-Structural Palestine is the current main method of ethnographic engagement. It is known primarily for its stance that challenges and brings to question Israel's efforts to repress Palestinian nationalism. The movement has seen a rising trend in which the Palestinian subject is explored for their national identity, rather than silenced.\n\nAnthropology as a discipline in Turkey can trace its roots back to 1925. Developing in an nationalistic atmosphere, The Anthropology Institute, otherwise known as The Center for Anthropological Research in Turkey, was established on that year within the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Istanbul. From 1925 to the 1960s, the main topics of research centered around studies of rural and village life, with a focus on nation building. In the 1960s, a series of military coups occurred, causing considerable changes to the field and to academia itself. It was not until the year 1997 that the first official department of anthropology was established in Turkey, at the private Yeditepe University in Istanbul. As of 2010, 6 of the 53 state universities in Turkey offered training in anthropology. In contrast to this, only one of the 24 private universities offer similar training. The first anthropological association in Turkey was founded in 1992.\n\nMany Anthropologists investigate the tribal system in Saudi Arabia. Anthropology was not popular in many countries; however, the Universities in Saudi Arabia are adopting Anthropology. \n\nAnthropological studies, which are concerned with the privacy of the UAE community with a tribal background are rare and limited.\nTribes are the most form of UAE. Many anthropologists are interested in investigating the form of tribes. Many of the Arab states of the Persian Gulf are also based on the tribal system.\n\nIn Qatar and Bahrain, anthropology was not as popular as other fields, like many other countries in the Persian Gulf region. Anthropology is expanding in educational aspect. Many anthropologists are also concerned on the structure of the tribes in the Arab countries in the Persian Gulf region (Gardner).\n\nWithin the Arab-majority countries, Egypt, has established itself among the other Arab-majority countries as the main hub for anthropologists in the region, with Cairo being the center for most of this attention. The rest of the country remains relatively understudied. Increased attention to Cairo can be attributed to the rise of anthropological interest in cities, particularly to the diverse interdisciplinary scholarship.\n\nThe centrality of Middle East area studies is largely responsible for the increase in anthropological attention towards Egypt. In addition to this is the accessibility of institutional support for US scholars.\n\nAs of the early 21st century, the relationship of Egypt with anthropology remains under question. Egyptian anthropologist, Hania Sholkamy, remarks that there are four main points that shape this ongoing relationship: the relationship of methods to theory, the relationship between methods and their analysis, the relationship of culture to its determinants, and the relationship between having data and being able to evaluate it.\n\nThe discipline of anthropology is in a constant state of judgment within Egypt, particularly when compared with the discipline of demography. The qualitative data more common in demography is given more attention than the theoretical and analytical methods associated with anthropology.\n\nIn Morocco, topics of anthropological research include the ethnicization of Jews, the construction of ethnicity among Berber, Arab, and Haratine groups through agricultural practices, and how Berber ethnicities are politicized in ways that create raced and gendered notions of homeland.\n\nThe region of Africa has had a long history of being colonized by others in economic and cultural ways, which is why the study of anthropology in Africa is a relatively new discipline that is usually grouped with historical work. Before becoming a discipline in the region, Western anthropologists came to the area to study and conduct ethnographies pertaining to the native culture of those who inhabited the area. Anthropologists in African academia are still on looking for what anthropology means to them. While anthropology was initially used by states to gain knowledge about local cultures, it was later seen as a way to help them. After the recognition of its importance many universities and associations have institutionalized departments, journals and conferences to carry out this work. This article includes the history, development, and future of African Anthropology in different regions.\n\nAnthropological study in Kenya, like many other parts of Africa, was dominated by foreign British academia. They were focused on studying the “other” and understanding them for state purposes. This era is known as the pre-independence period. There were very little local anthropologists after independence in 1963 until the 70s. The post-colonial era was filled with distrust for the subject of anthropology because of its link to previous colonizers. The East African Anthropological Association (EAAA) was founded in 2001 archaeology. This association was used to promote and unify anthropologists in East Africa and work towards a common goal. The EAAA was working to develop better programs in universities and create local opportunities for meetings within anthropological communities. It works with the Pan African Anthropological Association as well as many others in order to come up with ways to improve the country that they live in.\n\nThe growth and development of anthropology in Kenya was largely due to colonialism of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but as an actual discipline in the region, it wasn’t well developed until the 1980s. In 1938, the subject of anthropology became locally known through Jomo Kenyatta, who wrote and published \"Facing Mt. Kenya\", which was the first time any article was published from a native’s perspective. The methodology of anthropology in Kenya is neither strictly Kenyan, nor is it strictly Euro-American, but rather a combination of the various methods between the nations. Due to the variety of methods that were being taught worldwide, as well as the education development in Kenya, it was decided to create formal training for the discipline. There’s evidence of this from their two major universities of the University of Nairobi and Moi University. The University of Nairobi tended to disciplines of archaeology and anthropology, but taught them as separate departments, similar to England’s separation of the departments; and Moi University tended to the same disciplines of archaeology and anthropology, but taught the disciplines together in the same department of Anthropology, as is taught in the U.S.\n\nThe majority of British, as well as German, anthropologists dominated Kenya with their studies focusing solely on the groups of people who were considered to be distinct, or “otherly”. While some anthropologists studied these groups in order to achieve dominance over them, other anthropologists reasoned studying the communities for educational purposes before their culture no longer existed due to colonizing. Thus, causing a means for Kenya anthropologists to disassociate with colonialism because of its harsh effects on Africans and their culture. This forced the local anthropologists to rethink about socio-cultural studies, including their own discipline and how it aided in colonialism. Even Jomo Kenyatta, who had benefited from his education and studies, was struggling with the decision on whether to associate with the discipline anymore.\n\nLouis Leakey aided in bringing archaeology and physical anthropology to light in Kenya. He work as a curator in the Coryndon Memorial Museum, which is an important establishment that helps to keep excavation sites accessible, such as Koobi Fora, Olorgesailie, and the Hyrax Hill, to both local and foreign archaeologists. In the 1950s, alongside his wife, Leakey found various primate fossils, including those of Australopithecus Boisei (1959), Homo Habilis (1964), and Kenyapithecus (1967). In 1960, he established the Institute of Primate Research (IPR) which helped in comprehending human evolution and biomedical research for health challenges in Africa, such as HIV/AIDS.\n\nSince the discipline of anthropology was associated with colonialism, the nation-state of Kenya did not identify with its trajectories and could not support it. It wasn’t until Daniel Arap Moi, who succeeded Jomo as president, made culture a central means for socio-economic aspects, making anthropology slowly begin to gain popularity again among locals due to its national cultural ethos. In 1965, the University of Nairobi established its Institute for Development Studies which contained two aspects of social science and cultural divisions. The social science aspect of the department went on to develop its own Institute of Development Studies, which carried out economic development but through a multidisciplinary approach. The cultural divisions aspect used resources that informed university students, as well as regionally, from a cultural instruction perspective. In 1970, the two subjects came together and were known as the Institute of African Studies (IAS), in which students researched in African archaeology, history, social anthropology, musicology, linguistics, oral literature, traditional arts, crafts, and social systems; this institute even contributed to some of the top scholars such as musicologists P.N. Kavyu and , historians H.S.K. Mwaniki and William R. Ochieng’, and writers Okot p’Bitek and Taban lo Liyong. In 1986, the IAS had established its first anthropology training program, providing courses of medical, linguistic, economic, and ecological anthropology and material culture (Amuyunzu-Nyamongo, 2006).\n\nThe future of the discipline of anthropology consists of research projects dedicated to resolving health issues, such as malaria and HIV/AIDS, so it’s not a surprise that most anthropologists in Kenya today are either medical anthropologists or those anthropologists who study medical issues. Many of these local anthropologists are sought out for help by national non-government health organizations, like United State Agency for International Development, Family Health International, Engenderhealth, PATH, Population Council, African Population and Health Research Center, African Medical Research Foundation, the World Health Organization and the Ford Foundation. Kenyan anthropologists do not conduct research for personal needs, but for needs of their nation-state and those funding agencies that they provide information to for health resolutions. In response to this upcoming need, universities are developing programs, like Anthropology in Developing Countries, Applied Anthropology, Medical Anthropology, and Anthropology and Infectious Diseases, that educate for cultural developmental skills.\n\nBefore Cameroon was split by the British and French in 1915 it was under the control of the German government since 1884. Very little Anthropological work was done until this time when the state recognized how useful knowing more about its people would be. Phyllis Kaberry and Elizabeth Chilver were two prominent researchers in West African area in the min-1900s. Kaberry, a trained anthropologist from England, studied women in a local tribe from the \"grassfields\" of Cameroon. She also co-wrote several books and papers on topics concerning female roles in specific African cultures. In 1973 the first institute in Cameroon with an anthropology department was established. In 1978 departments that were seen as not practical were starting to be eliminated. After closing, reopening, and hiding within other departments, Anthropology was finally on the rise in the early 1990s.\n\nThe University of Yaoundé-I is a main institution in the area providing students with opportunities to gain degrees in Anthropology. Other Institutions of importance are the University of Ngaoundere and the University of Buea which in 1992 added anthropology departments. Both of these universities produce scholars from the local communities and they promote research that is of common interest to the area. Language being a barrier in academia until its independence, in 1960, where universities were fashioned in the European style of education systems. The University of Buea, a public university, offered the subjects in the English language which increased the number of local students that attend. Largely associated with sociology, the first person to gain a PhD in Social Anthropology from Cameroon was Paul Nkwi in 1975. In 1993, a B.A. in anthropology could be received form the University of Yaoundé.\n\nA stepping-stone organization was CODESRIA, which was an organization that helped develop and promote anthropology as an institution. It facilitated the establishment of the Pan African Anthropological Association (PAAA) in the 80s. The PAAA is cooperative movement that unified Anthropologists from all over Africa. Its goal was to make anthropology known again as a useful and essential department that Africa needed. This association is holding conferences annually, starting in 1989, to advance Anthropology and find ways to solve problems for the future. Some dominant research topics in the area are witchcraft, chiefdoms, health, violence and ethno-history. The PAAA started encouraging communication of cross disciplines to benefit Africa as a whole by discovering new ways of resolving issues. A leading journal in Africa is the African Anthropology, now known as The African Anthropologist, allows research from all over Africa to be shared and more easily accessible.\n\nThe history of the discipline of anthropology in South Africa comes from the result of political and ideological interpretations of the research there. In the 1920s, the South African Association for the Advancement of Science was established, and it was here that anthropology was known. Presentations were given by archeologists, linguists, anthropologists, and ethnologists; there was also a South African Journal of Science that many researchers published in as well. During the years of the 1940s to the 1990s, anthropology grew to be less popular due to the apartheid period, which in educators had strict guidelines as to what they could and couldn’t teach in the classroom, and they were not permitted to teach anything else but that particular curriculum.\n\nAnthropological studies and research were offered at sixteen different universities, in which sociocultural anthropology and archaeology were offered within the discipline, and in another department, linguistics, African studies, and Gender studies were linked in the discipline. Instead of using the word or teaching anthropology, the universities, more specifically Stellenbosch University, taught \"volkekunde\", which means knowledge about people, and it was first known from pre-WWII German passage that was written by Völkerkunde. This expansion of the discipline was also known as ethnology or cultural anthropology, and it was paired with aspects of the apartheid period. This caused a division between social anthropology and volkekunde, as well as Afrikaans-medium universities and English-medium universities, respectively.\n\nStellenbosch University (an Afrikaan-medium university) had established its first anthropological department due to Werner Eiselen, who was the Permanent Secretary in the National Department of Native Affairs, as well as being a developer of the concept of apartheid, with Hendrik Verwoerd being his partner. There were then new universities that were built in the 1960s, specifically for black students, which led to the continuation of the two types of universities within the area. The professors who obtained jobs at the new universities had a background that dealt with a volkekunde style of teaching anthropology. This entire movement didn’t appeal to those who identified themselves as social anthropologists in the discipline.\n\nEven with this division of the methods to anthropological research, there was a mutual respect and influence for social anthropological studies that were being conducted by researchers in the U.K., as well as the U.S. Most students were moving on to proceed in getting their doctoral degrees preferred to attend the University of Cambridge, due to its influence of academia through anthropologists who were South African natives, such as Meyer Fortes, Isaac Schapera, and Max Gluckman. South African anthropologists, such as Jean Comaroff and John Comaroff and Namibian-born Rob Gordon, who began their studies in their home region of South Africa, and more specifically at the Afrikaans-medium University of Stellenbosch, also had influence with the U.S. in their research.\n\nIn the 1960s, South African anthropologists made the decision to start leaving their country for careers and research studies because of the apartheid methods, the inequality within their societies, and there was an increase in the violence that was surrounding the region. In 1967, a committee was formed in order to begin negotiating anthropological conferences that were held at the University of South Africa, which added to the separation and tension of the social anthropologists and those who studied volkekunde. Ten years later, black anthropologists started to attend these conferences, and this made the volkekunde group to initiate another new conference that was only to host research projects to those studying ethnology; this new conference was known in the Afrikaans language as \"Vereniging van Afrikaanse Volkekundiges\", which is translated to mean Association of Afrikaans Ethnologists. This conference excluded entry to those who did not speak the original Afrikaans language of South Africa, or the regional state area, and it continued to have majority and favor until the 1980s when the social anthropologists decided to have their own conference as well.\n\nThe Association for Anthropology in Southern Africa (AASA) was established in 1987 excluded membership into the group for those who believed in the apartheid concepts. Before anyone could become members of the conference, they were to sign a document, or a contract, saying that they reject any and all apartheid theories and concepts. Regardless of this new conference, the methods of volkekunde remained to be prominent in the discipline of anthropology, though during the 1980s, the anthropology department of then known Rand Afrikaans University, which was one of the newer White Afrikaans-medium universities in the area, officially denounced volkekunde as their way of research, in fact, the entire teaching department of this discipline turned their backs to apartheid concepts entirely. Later on, Stellenbosch University, which was where the first volkekunde department to be established, was closed down in the mid-1990s. A few years afterward, the discipline of social anthropology was introduced within the Department of Sociology.\n\nThe new association of Anthropology South Africa was a cause to link the two distinguished branches of volkekunde and social anthropology. Its first annual conference was in 2001. In 2004, it became one of the founding members of the World Council of Anthropology Associations in Brazil. There aren’t very many volkekundiges, or ethnologists, who have membership within the ASnA, nor do most of them attend any of the conferences that are held. A majority of those who do attend the annual conference are young, predominantly black, postgraduate anthropologists, but there are also a growing number of faculty members from the South African University anthropology programs who participate as well. Though the faculty participation numbers are growing, the overall number of memberships within the ASnA fluctuate from year to year. This is due to postgraduates, who are members only having a membership for a year or two in order to obtain their dissertations. There is also a close link between membership and conference attendance, meaning that since the conferences are held in venues that are less accessible or less desirable, this doesn’t attract many anthropologists to participate and fewer people sign up for memberships.\n\nSome of the topics of research for sociocultural anthropologists in South Africa consist of medical anthropology, mostly concerning the HIV/AIDS pandemic in the region, development anthropology, urbanism, science and natural resources, conflict, violence and policing, human rights, identity politics and belonging, and popular culture. There isn’t much attention paid to subjects, such as economic anthropology, state formation, and religion and religious movements.\n\nAnthropologists at South African universities mostly publish to edited volumes and special theme collections in interdisciplinary and disciplinary journals in their own country, as well as internationally. One significant publication venue for South African anthropologists is the journal formerly known as the volkekunde’s Tydskrif van Suid Afrikaanse Volkekunde, which translates to Journal of South African Ethnology. The journal changed its name to Anthropology Southern Africa in 2002.\n\nAnthropologists, who studied in Africa and began their research from basic curiosities, cannot be of aid to how the discipline stays in existence. Anthropology thrived from outside and inside perspectives of the same region or aspect of culture; having a missions civilisatrice perspective divided observer and participant, instead of taking into consideration the culture within the region from the perspectives of those who have lived there. The aspect of not being able, or not wanting to, collaborate with natives from the country was due to the Malinowskian model. Researchers developed their own personal objectives and reasoning to what and who they were observing in the field. This caused an explicit division of Africa into several regions based on finding and observing the exotic “Other” from various basis of culture, race, and location. The concept of reflexivity helped anthropologists to realize that their personal needs and reasoning for research correlated with the aspect of seeing people differently instead of similarly. There was no insight from those who had inhabited the continent for centuries, and the country is not well represented. There was not a lot of support for methods that contradicted what had already been practiced and known within the discipline.\n\nUniversally, there were various debates about the methodology of the discipline in relation to folklore, co-production with aid of natives, and boundaries within the field. These aspects had not been taken into consideration when observing the region. Anthropology surviving in Africa were due to not observing Africa explicitly as scientific (racially or geographically), not seeing African identities and cultures as scientific, redefining the Malinowskian model, and making the methods of fieldwork and participant observation more flexible. Native anthropologists called for creative diversity and outsider anthropologists to observe themselves and how they contributed to the professional collaboration with those who were native to the region. This methodology or concept did not replace outside methods, but correlated the two methods together in knowledge about culture.\n"}

Before engineering was recognized as a formal profession, women with engineering skills often sought recognition as inventors, such as Hypatia of Alexandria (350 or 370–415 AD), who is credited with the invention of the hydrometer. During the Islamic Golden Period from 8th Century until 15th Century along with men who were masters in Engineering, philosophy, mathematics, Science,Physics etc., there were also many muslim women who were inventors and engineers much before the european rennaisance. In the 19th century, women who performed engineering work often had academic training in mathematics or science. Ada Lovelace (1815–1852) was privately schooled in mathematics before beginning her collaboration with Charles Babbage on his analytical engine that would earn her the designation of the \"first computer programmer.\" Hertha Marks Ayrton (1854–1923), a British engineer and inventor studied mathematics at Cambridge in the 1880s. Elisa Leonida Zamfirescu (1887–1973) is one of the first female engineers in Europe. In the early years of the twentieth century, a few women were admitted to engineering programs, but they were generally looked upon as curiosities by their male counterparts.\n\nAlice Perry was the first woman in Europe to graduate with a degree in engineering in 1906 from Queen's College, Galway. Elisa Leonida Zamfirescu, a Romanian engineer graduated from the Technical University of Berlin in 1912. The entry of the United States into World War II created a serious shortage of engineering talent as men were drafted into the armed forces. The GE on-the-job engineering training for women with degrees in mathematics and physics, and the Curtiss-Wright Engineering Program had \"Curtiss-Wright Cadettes\" (\"Engineering Cadettes\", e.g., Rosella Fenton). The company partnered with Cornell, Penn State, Purdue, the University of Minnesota, the University of Texas, RPI, and Iowa State University to create an engineering curriculum that eventually enrolled over 600 women. The course lasted ten months and focused primarily on aircraft design and production.\n\nKathleen McNulty (1921–2006), was selected to be one of the original programmers of the ENIAC. Georgia Tech began to admit women engineering students in 1952. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) had graduated its first female student, Ellen Swallow Richards (1842–1911) in 1873. The École Polytechnique in Paris first began to admit women students in 1972. The number of BA/BS degrees in engineering awarded to women in the U.S. increased by 45 percent between 1980 and 1994. However, from 1984–1994, the number of women graduating with a BA/BS degree in computer science decreased by 23 percent.\n\nAlthough the terms engineer and engineering date from the Middle Ages, they acquired their current meaning and usage only recently in the nineteenth century. Briefly, an engineer is one who uses the principles of engineering – namely acquiring and applying scientific, mathematical, economic, social, and practical knowledge – in order to design and build structures, machines, devices, systems, materials and processes. Some of the major branches of the engineering profession include civil engineering, military engineering, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, electrical engineering, aerospace engineering, computer engineering, and biomedical engineering.\n\nBefore engineering was recognized as a formal profession, women with engineering skills often sought recognition as inventors. One of the earliest women inventors was Hypatia of Alexandria (350? 370?–415), who is credited with the invention of the hydrometer. Tabitha Babbit (1784–1853?) was an American toolmaker who invented the first circular saw. Sarah Guppy (1770–1852) was an Englishwoman who patented a design for bridge foundations. Mary Dixon Kies (1752–1837) was the first American woman to receive a patent for her method of weaving straw in 1809.\n\nWith the coming of the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, new technology-based occupations opened up for both men and women. Sarah Bagley (1806–?) is remembered not only for her efforts to improved working conditions for women mill workers in Lowell, Massachusetts, in the 1830s and 1840s, but also for being one of the earliest women to work as a telegraph operator. Mathilde Fibiger (1830–1872), a Danish novelist and advocate of women's rights, became a telegraph operator for the Danish State Telegraph system in the 1860s.\n\nEngineering began to be taught as a formal academic discipline in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The École Polytechnique in France was established in 1794 to teach military and civil engineering; West Point Military Academy in the United States established a program modeled after the École Polytechnique in 1819. Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) began to teach civil engineering in 1828. However, none of these institutions admitted women as students at the time of their founding.\n\nIn the 19th century, women who performed engineering work often had academic training in mathematics or science. Ada Lovelace (1815–1852), Lord Byron's daughter, was privately schooled in mathematics before beginning the collaboration with Charles Babbage on his analytical engine that would earn her the designation of the \"first computer programmer.\" Hertha Marks Ayrton (1854–1923), a British engineer and inventor who helped develop electric arc lighting, studied mathematics at Cambridge in 1880, but was denied a degree, as women were only granted certificates of completion at the time. Similarly, Mary Engle Pennington (1872–1952), an American chemist and refrigeration engineer, completed the requirements for a BS degree in chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania in 1892, but was given a certificate of proficiency instead.\nRita de Morais Sarmento (1872–1931) was the first woman to obtain an Engineering degree from the Polytechnic Academy of Porto, in Portugal. She obtained this degree in 1894 and latter certified in 1896, which means she may have been the first formally recognised female engineer in Europe.\nElisa Leonida Zamfirescu (1887–1973) is one of the first formally recognised female engineers in Europe. Due to prejudices against women in the sciences, she was rejected by the School of Bridges and Roads in Bucharest, Romania. However, in 1909, she was accepted at the Royal Academy of Technology in Berlin. She graduated from the university in 1912, with a degree in engineering, specialising in chemistry, possibly becoming one of the first women engineers in the world. Other women in engineering in the same time period include three Danish women: Agnes Klingberg, Betzy Meyer, and Julie Arenholt, who graduated in 1897 and 1901 from 'Polyteknisk Læreanstalt', today known as the Danish Technical University. The first female engineering graduate in Britain was Alice Perry who graduated from Queen's College, Galway in 1906.\n\nWomen without formal engineering degrees were also integral to great 19th century civil engineering feats. Emily Warren Roebling is recognized as managing the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge, and was the first person to cross the bridge at its opening ceremony in 1883. Roebling's husband, Washington Roebling, worked as the chief engineer for the Brooklyn Bridge project until he fell ill of decompression sickness. Upon her husband's illness, Emily Warren Roebling assumed her husband's duties at the project site, and taught herself about material properties, cable construction, calculating catenary curves, and the like.\n\nIn the early years of the twentieth century, a few women were admitted to engineering programs, but they were generally looked upon as curiosities by their male counterparts. Nora Stanton Blatch Barney (1883–1971), daughter of Harriot Stanton Blatch and granddaughter of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, was the first woman to receive a degree in civil engineering from Cornell University in 1905. In the same year, she was accepted as a junior member of the American Society of Civil Engineers; however, twelve years later, after having worked as an engineer, architect, and engineering inspector, her request for an upgrade to associate membership was denied. Olive Dennis (1885–1957), who became the second woman to graduate from Cornell with a civil engineering degree in 1920, was initially hired by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad as a draftsman; however, she later became the first person to claim the title of Service Engineer when this title was created.\n\nAlice Perry was the first woman in Europe to graduate with a degree in engineering in 1908 from Queen's College, Galway. Elisa Leonida Zamfirescu, a Romanian engineer graduated from the Technical University of Berlin in 1912.\n\nEdith Clarke, the inventor of the graphical calculator, was the first woman to earn a degree in MIT's electrical engineering department in 1918. Clarke also became the first woman admitted to the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, the precursor to the IEEE. She taught at the University of Texas Austin, where she was the only woman faculty member in the engineering department.\n\nThe entry of the United States into World War II created a serious shortage of engineering talent as men were drafted into the armed forces at the same time that industry ramped up production of armaments, battleships, and airplanes. The U.S. Office of Education initiated a series of courses in science and engineering that were open to women as well as men.\n\nPrivate programs for women included GE on-the-job engineering training for women with degrees in mathematics and physics, and the Curtiss-Wright Engineering Program had \"Curtiss-Wright Cadettes\" (\"Engineering Cadettes\", e.g., Rosella Fenton). The company partnered with Cornell, Penn State, Purdue, the University of Minnesota, the University of Texas, RPI, and Iowa State University to create an engineering curriculum that eventually enrolled over 600 women. The course lasted ten months and focused primarily on aircraft design and production.\n\nThelma Estrin (1924–2014 ), who would later become a pioneer in the fields of computer science and biomedical engineering, took a 1942 three-month engineering assistant course at Stevens Institute of Technology and earned University of Wisconsin BSc, MSc, and PhD degrees.\n\nThrough an accelerated program brought on by the war, Lois Graham (1925-2013) graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1946 and was the first woman in the United States to receive a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from Illinois Institute of Technology (M.S. ME ’49, Ph.D. ’59).\n\nIn 1943, the United States Army authorized a secret project at the University of Pennsylvania's Moore School of Electrical Engineering to develop an electronic computer to compute artillery firing tables for the Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory. The project, which came to be known as ENIAC, or Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, was completed in 1946.\n\nPrevious to the development of the ENIAC, the U.S. Army had employed women trained in mathematics to calculate artillery trajectories, at first using mechanical desk calculators and later the differential analyzer developed by Vannevar Bush, at the Moore School. In 1945, one of these \"computers\", Kathleen McNulty (1921–2006), was selected to be one of the original programmers of the ENIAC, together with Frances Spence (1922– ), Betty Holberton (1917–2001), Marlyn Wescoff, Ruth Lichterman (1924–1986), and Betty Jean Jennings (1924–2011). McNulty, Holberton, and Jennings would later work on the UNIVAC, the first commercial computer developed by the Remington Rand Corporation in the early 1950s.\n\nIn 1946, Hattie Scott Peterson gained a degree in civil engineering, believed to be the first African-American woman to do so.\n\nThe Cold War and the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union created additional demands for trained engineering talent in the 1950s and 1960s. Many engineering schools in the U.S. that had previously admitted only male students began to tentatively adopt coeducation. After 116 years as an all-male institution, RPI began to admit small numbers of female students in the 1940s. Georgia Tech began to admit women engineering students in 1952, but only in programs not available in other state universities. It would be 1968 before women were admitted to all courses offered by Georgia Tech.\n\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) had graduated its first female student, Ellen Swallow Richards (1842–1911) in 1873; she later became an instructor at MIT. However, until the 1960s, MIT enrolled few female engineering students, due in part to a lack of housing for women students. After the completion of the first women's dormitory on campus, McCormick Hall, in 1964, the number of women enrolled increased greatly. Influenced in part by the second wave feminism movement of the late 1960s and 1970s, female faculty members at MIT, including Mildred Dresselhaus and Sheila Widnall, began to actively promote the cause of women's engineering education.\n\nThe École Polytechnique in Paris first began to admit women students in 1972.\n\nMargaret Hamilton is also notable for her contributions to computer and aerospace engineering in the 1970s. Hamilton, the director of the Software Engineering Division of the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory at the time, is famous for her work in writing the on-board guidance code for the Apollo 11 mission.\n\nAs more engineering programs were opened to women, the number of women enrolled in engineering programs increased dramatically. The number of BA/BS degrees in engineering awarded to women in the U.S. increased by 45 percent between 1980 and 1994. However, during the period of 1984–1994, the number of women graduating with a BA/BS degree in computer science decreased by 23 percent (from 37 percent of graduates in 1984 to 28 percent in 1994). This phenomenon became known as \"The incredible shrinking pipeline,\" from the title of a 1997 paper on the subject by Dr. Tracy Camp, a professor in the Department of Mathematical and Computer Sciences at the Colorado School of Mines.\n\nSome of the reasons for the decline cited in the paper included:\n\nAccording to studies by the National Science Foundation, the percentage of BA/BS degrees in engineering awarded to women in the U.S. increased steadily from 0.4 percent in 1966 to a peak of 20.9 percent in 2002, and then dropped off slightly to 18.5 percent in 2008. However, the trend identified in \"The incredible shrinking pipeline\" has continued; the percentage of BA/BS degrees in mathematics and computer science awarded to women peaked in 1985 at 39.5 percent, and declined steadily to 25.3 percent in 2008.\n\nThe percentage of master's degrees in engineering awarded to women increased steadily from 0.6 percent in 1966 to 22.9 percent in 2008. The percentage of doctoral degrees in engineering awarded to women during the same period increased from 0.3 percent to 21.5 percent.\n\nOnly 9.6% of engineers in Australia are women, and the rate of women in engineering degree courses has remained around 14% since the 1990s.\n\nThe percentage of female and technology engineering graduates rose from 7 percent in 1984 to 14.6 percent in 2018. The proportion of engineers in industry who are women is, on the other hand, still very low at around 11.8% – the lowest percentage in the EU.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2247943", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2247943", "title": "Home theater in a box", "text": "Home theater in a box\n\nA \"home theater in a box\" (HTIB) is an integrated home theater package which \"bundles\" together a combination DVD or Blu-ray player, a multi-channel amplifier (which includes a surround sound decoder, a radio tuner, and other features), speaker wires, connection cables, a remote control, a set of five or more surround sound speakers (or more rarely, just left and right speakers, a lower-price option known as \"2.1\") and a low-frequency subwoofer cabinet.\nIn 2016,\nthey are manufactured by most makers of consumer electronics. Budget HTIB's with generic or lower-price \"house\" brands (e.g., Best Buy's \"Insignia\" line) may be a \"2.1\" system. Many, however, are a full \"5.1\" system and some higher-end packages even have a 7.1 system. Some popular manufacturers of HTIB's are RCA, Philips, Panasonic, Sony, Yamaha, LG and Samsung, all of which make a variety of mid-price range packages. Bose and Onkyo make higher-end, higher-priced HTIB packages.\n\nHTIBs are marketed as an \"all-in-one\" way for consumers to enjoy the surround sound experience of home cinema, even if they do not want to-or do not have the electronics \"know-how\" to pick out all of the components one-by-one and connect the cables. If a consumer were to buy all of the items individually, they would have to have a basic knowledge of electronics, so they could, for example, ensure that the speakers were of compatible impedance and power-handling for the amplifier. As well, the consumer would have to ensure that they purchased all of the different connection cables, which could include HDMI cables, optical connectors, speaker wire, and RCA connectors.\n\nOn the downside, most HTIBs lack the features and \"tweakability\" of home theater components which are sold separately. For example, while a standalone home theater amplifier may offer extensive equalization options, a HTIB amplifier may simply provide a few factory-set EQ presets. As well, while a standalone home theatre subwoofer may contain a range of sound-shaping circuitry, such as a crossover control, a phase inversion switch, and a parametric equalizer, a HTIB subwoofer system usually has its crossover point set at the factory, which means that the user cannot change it. In some cases, the factory preset crossover point on an HTIB subwoofer may cause it to sound too \"boomy\" in a room.\n\nA typical HTIB generally consists of a central receiver unit which usually contains a DVD player (some systems separate the DVD player into a separate unit), a multi-channel power amplifier and a series of speakers for surround sound use, generally including a subwoofer. Some HTIB systems also have a radio tuner or an Internet-based streaming audio platform (e.g. Spotify). The least expensive systems usually have a passive subwoofer, which is amplified by the receiver unit. HTIB systems do not include a television set or monitor with which to display the visual material or a stand to place the receiver unit on. Beside auxiliary inputs, many of them are equipped today with HDMI with ARC, optical and SPDIF inputs. Some HTIB systems are also equipped with a phono input, to allow the connection of a turntable with magnetic cartridge. However such systems are not suitable for vinyl playing as they are mainly focussed on movies and rarely for high fidelity. Some home theaters are just stereo or 2.1, but even so, they are not intended as hi fi, this is just a marketing strategy.\n\nThere are systems in this class that are sold without a DVD player and are designed to integrate with existing video setups where there is already one, such as a DVD recorder or a DVD/VCR combo unit. The speaker cabinets supplied with most systems in this class are generally fairly small compared to typical stereo speakers, and are meant for wall- or shelf-mounting in tight spaces. There are some systems in this class that are supplied with slim freestanding speakers that stand on the floor. This may be typical of higher-priced systems that are equipped with more powerful amplifiers or most of the \"receiver-only\" packages that do not come with a DVD player.\n\nSome HTIBs use proprietary connectors between components, sometimes even combining several different wires into one connector, to reduce cable clutter and increase the ease of installation. However, this can impede interoperability between different audio/visual devices and makes upgrading certain parts impossible. This may also be used by manufacturers to limit what a consumer can do with a low-end model and encourage them to upgrade should they want more autonomy.\n\nA few manufacturers, notably Sony and Panasonic, have implemented wireless connection technology for the surround speakers in this class of equipment. This technology may be available as standard with some of the high-priced models or may be supplied as an aftermarket kit that only works with selected models in the manufacturer's range. It usually uses a line-level feed over a proprietary wireless link to a separate power amplifier used for the surround-sound channels. This link-receiver and power amplifier can be built into one of the surround speakers or housed in a black box that the surround speakers are connected to. Some higher-end HTIB models offer additional features such as 1080i or 4K ( mainly versions with Blu-ray) video resolution upscaling, a 5-disc platter, HDMI inputs, USB connectivity, Bluetooth support, Wi-fi support, Internet apps, DAB and DAB+, mirroring possibility, iPod dock and a hard disk for recording TV shows.\n\nSome older HTIBs from the 1990s had a built-in VCR, besides a DVD, along with a TV tuner, and a hard disk for recording TV shows.\n"}
{"id": "3105499", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3105499", "title": "Huei tlamahuiçoltica", "text": "Huei tlamahuiçoltica\n\nHuei tlamahuiçoltica omonexiti in ilhuicac tlatocaçihuapilli Santa Maria totlaçonantzin Guadalupe in nican huei altepenahuac Mexico itocayocan Tepeyacac (\"By a great miracle appeared the heavenly queen, Saint Mary, our precious mother of Guadalupe, here near the great altepetl of Mexico, at a place called Tepeyacac\") is the title of a tract in Nahuatl, being its opening words. The tract comprises 36 pages and was published in Mexico City, Mexico in 1649 by Luis Laso de la Vega, the vicar of the chapel of Our Lady of Guadalupe at Tepeyac outside the same city. It is generally known by the abbreviated title Huei Tlamahuiçoltica (\"\"The Great Event\"). In the preface Luis Laso de la Vega claimed authorship of the whole work, but this claim is the subject of an ongoing difference of scholarly opinion.\n\nThe tract is written almost entirely in Nahuatl and includes the \"Nican Mopohua\", which narrates the apparitions of Our Lady of Guadalupe at Tepeyac in 1531. \n\nThere is an equally contentious and much shorter manuscript in Nahuatl preceding the \"Nican Mopohua\", which is titled the \"Inin Huey Tlamahuiçoltzin\" (\"This Is the Great Marvel\"), also known as \"The Primitive Relation\"\" of the apparitions. It is in The National Library of México.\n\nThe \"Huei Tlamahuiçoltica\" also includes the \"Nican Motecpana\", which enumerates the miracles attributed by some to D. Fernando de Alva Ixtlilxochitl; Luis Laso de la Vega does not mention either him or Antonio Valeriano as authors.\n\nThe traditions recounted in the 1649 tract were first published in the Spanish book \"Imagen de la Virgen María, Madre de Dios de Guadalupe\" (\"Image of the Virgin Mary, Mother of God of Guadalupe\"), written by Miguel Sánchez in 1648 and being a theological dissertation linking the Guadalupan Image to .\n\nThe first section, a preface, is titled in Nahuatl \"Noble Queen of Heaven, Forever Virgin, Mother of God\". In it Lasso addresses the Virgin directly, and after an introduction of four to five lines proceeds to the reason why he took up Nahuatl in order to publish the history of the apparitions:\n\nThe preface ends with a short prayer in two lines pleading the Virgin's intercession for the assistance of the Holy Spirit in writing in Nahuatl.\n\nThe second section, the \"Nican Mopohua\" (\"Here Is Recounted\") constitutes the narrative in Nahuatl of the apparitions, including the Virgin's apparition to St. Juan Diego's uncle Juan Bernardino. It is probable that the Nahuatl manuscript used by Lasso was the original by Valeriano, which is presently in the New York Public Library. Most authorities agree on this and on the dating of its authorship, namely c. 1556, even O'Gorman.\n\nThe \"Nican Mopohua\", which has been described as \"A Jewel of Nahuatl literature, whose beauty and depth of thought make it worthy of renown the world over\", relies on the beauty of the dialogues between the Holy Virgin and St. Juan Diego to express the most tender feelings to be found in world literature. Her promise to grant the wishes of the locals who beseech her is prominent, as is her demand for a temple on the very spot. The \"Nican Mopohua\" section by Valeriano of Lasso de la Vega's account is related in a poetic style, typical of the most elegant formal classical Nahuatl in its full beauty. The other parts are clearly different and with greater Spanish influence. The \"Nican Mopohua\" is unique for presenting a blending between the deepest Nahuatl thought with the Christian message. Scholar Richard Nebel insists that the \"Nican Mopohua\" is not necessarily a historical account, but a document designed to convert the Nahua and \"bring about a state of harmony between different peoples, cultures, and religions, in order that, during a period of radical change, new possibilities of coexistence could be envisaged\". It is precisely on this point that an abysmal difference exists with other dialogues which invoke elements of the dramatic writings (called \"autos\"), many of which were used for the purposes of proselytization during the Spanish colonization of Mexico. The \"autos\" reflect only Spanish Christian thinking, while the main characteristic of the \"Nican Mopohua\" is the exceptional blending of the best of two cultures. Leon-Portilla suggests, \"That there is in [the \"Nican Mopohua\"] an exposition of key ideas in Christian thinking, wrapped up in the language and form conceived from the world of the Nahua. It is without a doubt that this narrative seeks to demonstrate who God and the Virgin Mary are and that their relations are of kindness and protection for human beings.\" The emphasis on the beauty of a miraculous event as given by the \"Nican Mopohua\" can be contrasted with the account of Sánchez, which focuses primarily on the agreements between Indian accounts of the apparition and Biblical prophecy, most notably and .\n\nBecause the apparition, and the purportedly miraculous transposition of the Virgin's image onto Diego's \"tilma\" (\"mantle\") of \"ayatl\", i. e. maguey cloth, are largely credited with the conversion of the Native American \"Mexica\" (Aztecs) and other peoples of Mexico to Catholicism, all documents pertaining to the alleged miracle have been the subject of the intense scrutiny of the Roman Catholic Church, the colonial Spanish Crown and after 1820 the Mexican government, scholars of Latin American religion and history, scholars of classical Nahuatl, and independent Guadalupanos, skeptics, and historians the world over.\n\nIn authorizing the publication of the \"Huei tlamahuiuçoltica\", in an \"opinion\" published as part of the front matter to the main text, Baltazar González, a Jesuit professor, Nahuatl speaker, and contemporary of Laso de la Vega, asserted that the \"Huei tlamahuiçoltica\" \"...agrees with what is known of the facts from tradition and the annals.\" Until recently, there had been little secular scholarship that questioned the literal or factual nature of the origin of the images or texts.\n\nSome contemporary scholars have written skeptical or critical texts about the origin of the image and the texts. Sousa, Poole and Lockhart, in their 1998 edition and translation, suggested that the most reasonable hypothesis was that Laso de la Vega's core narrative was based on Sánchez's \"Image of the Virgin Mary\", with an early 17th-century engraving by Samuel Stradanus as a secondary source. Today, Catholics, especially those in Mexico and the rest of Latin America, accept the \"Nican Mopohua\", whether written by Laso de la Vega, Valeriano, or another, unknown author, as the primordial telling of the Virgin Mary's personal evangelism to the indigenous peoples of the Americas.\n\nAccording to Cambridge professor of Mexican history David Brading, \"...the romantic engagement with folk culture that characterized the revolutionary years was eventually taken up by the clergy. Equally important, the effect of the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965) and the rise of Liberation Theology was to convert the text into a potent catechetical instrument, since its emphasis on a poor peasant and his willing acceptance of the Virgin's message, not to mention [Bishop] Zumárraga's initial disdain, responded perfectly to the new-found 'option for the poor'.\"\n\nThe third section is a description of the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe as it was exhibited in the chapel of Tepeyac during Laso de la Vega's day.\n\nThe fourth section, called the \"Nican Motecpana\" (Nahuatl: \"Here is an ordered account\"), relates the fourteen miracles ascribed to the image of the Virgin that remained stamped on Juan Diego's \"tilma\" after the apparition.\n\nThe fifth section is a post-apparition biography of Juan Diego, detailing his pious life and devotion to the Virgin and her image.\n\nThe sixth section, the \"Nican Tlantica\" (Nahuatl: \"Here ends\"), is a general history of the Virgin in New Spain and an exhortation to her devotion.\n\nThe seventh section is another prayer, this one following the structure of the \"Salve Regina\".\n\nThe responsibility for the composition and authorship of the \"Huei Tlamahuiçoltica\" is assigned by a majority of contemporary Nahuatl scholars and historians to Luis Laso de la Vega, vicar of the chapel at Tepeyac. There is some possibility that Laso de la Vega had collaborators in the composition of the work, but there is insufficient material evidence to demonstrate whether one or more hands were involved in the construction of the Nahuatl-language text.\n\nThe work was initially published under the auspices of Dr. Pedro de Barrientos Lomelín, vicar general of the Mexican diocese, at the press of Juan Ruiz in 1649.\nIn 1666, Lic. Luis Becerra Tanco (1603–1672), a secular priest, affirmed that the Nahuatl account was based on long-standing oral tradition in a deposition for the inquiries of Francisco de Siles, who was commissioned to compile documentation of the continuity of the Virgin's popular cult since the time of her apparition. Becerra Tanco later elaborated on this position in his \"Felicidad de México\" (\"Mexico's Happiness\" of 1675, claiming that Laso de la Vega's text must have been based on documents created through collaborations between the Franciscan faculty of the College of Santa Cruz Tlatelolco and their indigenous pupils shortly after the apparition itself and purported to have been in the custody of Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxochitl. He even claimed to have seen among these papers \"a manuscript book written in the letters of our alphabet in an Indian's hand in which were described the four apparitions of the Most Holy Virgin to the Indian Juan Diego and his uncle Juan Bernardino.\"\n\nOther scholars who have disputed Laso de la Vega's authorship include Francisco de Florencia, a Jesuit chronicler, who assumed that the \"Indian manuscript\" mentioned by Becerra Tanco was written by Jerónimo de Mendieta, (d. 1605), a Franciscan missionary and historian in early New Spain, and Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora, Florencia's censor, who, by way of correction of his charge, swore that he \"found this account among the papers of Fernando de Alva. [...] The original in Mexican [Nahuatl] is of the letter of don Antonio Valeriano, an Indian, who is its true author\". According to the sworn testimony of D. Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora, the original preprint was in the calligraphy of Antonio Valeriano, its author. A very old and battered partial manuscript copy of the \"Nican Mopohua\" comprising 16 pages and dated to c. 1556 can be found at the Public Library of New York; it has been there since 1880, together with two later copies, one of which is complete. The older copy appears in the \"Tonanzin Guadalupe\" with full historical details.\n\nSome contemporary scholars uphold the notion that Becerra Tanco, Florencia, and Sigüenza y Góngora endeavored to authenticate the events of the narrative by placing its original authorship in hands that were both native to Mexico and of greater antiquity than the mid-17th century. Since Mexican petitioners to the Vatican for official recognition of the miracle relied on Sigüenza y Góngora's testimony that the story predated the publication of both the \"Nican Mopohua\" and \"Image of the Virgin Mary\", ecclesiastical writers have continued to cite Valeriano as its author.\n"}

{"id": "12916365", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12916365", "title": "InterWorld", "text": "InterWorld\n\nInterWorld is a fantasy and science fiction novel by Neil Gaiman and Michael Reaves. The book was published in 2007 by EOS, an imprint of HarperCollins Publishers. It follows the story of Joey Harker who, together with a group of other Joeys from different Earths in other parallel universes, try to stop the two forces of magic and science from taking over all of the Earths in different universes.\n\nJoey Harker is an average high school student living in Greenville. He had trouble finding his way around his own house, let alone the town. On a field trip set by his Social Studies teacher, Mr. Dimas, Joey found himself lost in the city. He then entered a strange fog and when he emerged, everything had changed. All the cars were brightly coloured and the police cars was flashing green and yellow instead of blue and red. He went back home and discovered that he does not exist anymore, instead a girl named Josephine lived there. He ran outside and met a man wearing a mirrored mask. The man introduced himself as Jay. Before Jay could explain anything, three men appeared, standing on floating silver disks and wearing grey outfits appeared, all trying to catch Joey using silver nets. Joey runs, unintentionally entering the fog again.\n\nAfraid of going back to a home where he doesn't exist, Joey decided to go to Mr. Dimas for help. When he met Mr. Dimas, Mr Dimas was shocked to see Joey, telling him that he had drowned last year and that Mr. Dimas himself had pulled Joey's body out of the river. Suddenly a woman appeared in the room, bewitching Joey into following her. She calls herself Lady Indigo and is joined by two other men. One, called Scarabus, had mystical tattoos all over his body. The other, a man with transparent skin, is called Neville. They moved Joey to a flying ship, the \"Lacrimae Mundi\".\n\nThe ship teleports to \"Nowhere-at-all\", a sort of hyperspace. They were heading towards a place called \"HEX Prime\".Before they could reach there, Jay arrived and helped Joey escape, getting himself injured in the process. Joey then opened a portal to the \"In-Between\", a multidimensional world, where only Walkers and MDLF (multidimensional life forms, or mudluffs) beings could enter. The \"in-between\" is a shortcut for traveling from world to world. Joey and Jay exited \"in-between\" and arrived at a desert. There Jay explained to Joey how he was a part of an organization called \"InterWorld\" and their job was to keep the altiverse balanced by stopping the scientific force (Binary) from making worlds too scientific, while also stopping the magical force (HEX) from making worlds too magical. Jay also said that Joey had the ability to \"Walk\", or go into the In-Between and other dimensions quickly and effectively.\n\nAfter re-entering the \"in-between\", they met a mudluff which looked like a bubble and communicated using colours. It appeared to be trapped by something. Joey approaches it and as Joey tries to free the mudluff, a giant serpent (Revealed in the second book to be called a Gyradon) appears, biting Jay. The mudluff kills the serpent but Jay was already dying. Before he dies he gave Joey the direction to Base Town, where InterWorld HQ is. With his dying breath, he showed Joey a mathematical equation that would lead to Base Town: {IW}:=Ω/∞ (InterWorld is Omega over Infinity). The mudluff then becomes attached to Joey and he names it \"Hue\". Joey then went to HQ and learns that all Walkers were all copies of himself from different Earths. He began an intense course of exercise while studying very advanced science and magic to prepare him for his new role as a member of the InterWorld. Many of the other Joeys initially resented Joey for causing Jay's death, but soon come around about him as his skills improve.\n\nAfter a few months, Joey and four other Walkers went on a training mission. They were supposed to retrieve some signal beacons in a more scientific earth. But the earth they went to turned out to be a \"shadow realm\" and is in fact a trap, set by the same people who captured him earlier from HEX. Everyone in the team was captured by HEX, except Joey who was saved by Hue. When Joey escaped back to HQ, the leader, an old man named Joe (a.k.a. Old Man), decided that Joey is not capable of working in InterWorld, and wiped Joey's mind of his life in InterWorld. Joey was then sent home, where he thought nothing had happened, but feels like something is missing. After some time, while blowing bubbles with his little brother, Joey remembers Hue, and every memory about the Altiverse comes back to him. With all those memories back, Joey said goodbye to his family, Walks into the Altiverse again, and set off to save his teammates.\n\nWith Jay's words in his head and Hue's help, Joey finds the airship where his teammates were being held, and lands safely on it. However, he was captured as well and taken to meet Lord Dogknife, a large hideous goblin who led the people who captured his teammates. Joey was then taken to the room where his teammates are being held. A large cauldron is in the center of the room, built to capture their souls to power the ship. The HEX boil down Walkers to their raw essence, which was used as power supplies for their transdimensional spacecraft.\n\nJoey manages to move over to the cauldron and knocked it over, incinerating some of the guards in the room. He then moved over to untie his friends, who all try to find an exit. They found an exit and escaped to the engine room.\n\nThe engine room was filled with souls from other Walkers, powering the ship. Joey and his teammates broke the jars containing them to free the souls and shut the ship down. The engine explodes, and Joey and his teammates plan an escape from the Nowhere-At-All. They talk of a gate in the Nowhere-At-All from which they can escape, but it was closing quickly. Joey decides he would not leave without Hue, because it had saved his life multiple times.\n\nMany soldiers then came into the destroyed engine room in an attempt to recapture Joey and his teammates, along with Scarabus. J/O, a cyborg Joey, offered a duel and defeated Scarabus, and everyone went to find Lord Dogknife.\n\nDogknife was in the room where Joey saw him earlier, captured by the souls and thus rendered harmless. Joey finds Hue and escapes with his teammates. They were about to escape when Lady Indigo appeared to face them. Joey distracts her from fighting them with some powder in his pocket, and he and his teammates escaped through the gate before returning to Interworld HQ.\n\nThey return to the Old Man, who did not congratulate them for their heroic work. Instead, he lectured them on all their wrongdoings in the Altiverse. However, he now said that Joey was allowed to stay without wiping his memory. The group soon set out on another mission.\n\nThe idea of \"InterWorld\" surged in 1996, when Reaves was developing an animated series for DreamWorks. Suggesting to Gaimain an idea for a possible animated television series, they collaborated on the story and unsuccessfully tried to sell it to various studios, including DreamWorks, which was not interested. The \"InterWorld\" idea ended up being a novel that was not released until 2007.\n\nOn June 16, 2007, Neil Gaiman reported in his journal that DreamWorks Animation optioned the book to make it into an animated feature film.\n\nOn June 21, 2016, the previous plans to make \"InterWorld\" a television series had become active once again by Universal Cable Productions, in association with \"Hamilton\" producer Jeffrey Seller and his partner Flody Suarez.\n\nThe second \"InterWorld\" book, titled \"The Silver Dream\", was released on April 23, 2013. The third and final book in the series, titled \"Eternity's Wheel\", was released on May 19, 2015.\n\n"}
{"id": "52994567", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52994567", "title": "Leonora Beck Ellis", "text": "Leonora Beck Ellis\n\nLeonora Beck Ellis (née, Leonora Beck; 1862-1951) was a 19th-century American educator, author, poet, and Southern social reformer, from the U.S. state of Georgia. She served as president of the Woman’s Press Association of Georgia, and for five years, was president of the Capital Female College of Atlanta.\n\nLeonora Beck was born near Augusta, Georgia, in 1862. Her father, Rev. James W. Beck (born Wilkes County, Georgia, October 23, 1831), was among the first teachers at Jackson Institute. Her mother was Margaret Willis, of Meriwether County, Georgia. There were two brothers: Marcus W., judge of the Flint circuit court; and Walter L., business manager of the Griffin Wheel company, of Chicago.\n\nAt an early age, she showed an unusual aptitude for linguistic study, speaking several modern languages when nine years old. She was well grounded in Latin and Greek when 15 years old. Ellis was educated at Oxford College, in Alabama, the only college for men in the South which received women. There, she studied and trained for the teaching profession, graduating at the age of 16 years with A.M. distinction.\n\nAt once, Ellis accepted the position of young lady principal in the college at Bowdon, Georgia, which she held for two and a half years. During her connection with that institution, Ellis instructed in metaphysics, Latin and Greek about 100 students, ranging from the ages of 15 to 30 years. Her success as an educator becoming more generally known, she was urged to accept many positions of trust and honor, but declined them. Next, she taught at the Jackson Institute in Jackson, Georgia. In 1889, Ellis removed to Atlanta to engage in founding the Capital Female College, later known as the Leonora Beck College. \n\nAfter her marriage to Richard Abbey Ellis, editor of the Atlanta \"Illustrator\", on June 2, 1896, she devoted herself to literature. Ellis' earliest articles appeared in \"Munsey's\", \"Leslie's\", the \"Bachelor of Arts\", and the \"New England Magazine\", in 1896 and 1897. Afterwards, she contributed stories, essays, travel sketches, and occasional verse to many different periodicals, but her chief writing was upon economic and sociological themes, and her thoughtful papers upon such subjects appeared from time to time in the \"Forum\", the \"Arena\", the \"Independent\", the \"Review of Reviews\", among others. Especially, she devoted herself to the varying phases of the great industrial revolution in the South, and her papers treating of social, educational, and material conditions in the manufacturing population of that section were accepted as high authority. Besides a volume of stories entitled 'Star Heights', and an occasional poem, a series of essays on Robert Browning was, perhaps, her most enduring contribution to literature.\n\nEllis was the author of a number of articles bearing upon economic and sociological conditions in the South. The Library of Congress listed her series of articles on child labor, because of the interest which they possess for students of this problem. Ellis spent much of her time in Aripeka, Florida. She was engaged in making investigations among the sponge fishers of the Florida coast. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "360128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=360128", "title": "List of conspiracy theories", "text": "List of conspiracy theories\n\nMany unproven conspiracy theories exist with varying degrees of popularity, frequently related to clandestine government plans and elaborate murder plots. Conspiracy theories usually deny consensus or cannot be proven using the historical or scientific method and are not to be confused with research concerning verified conspiracies such as Germany's pretense for invading Poland in World War II.\n\nNumerous conspiracy theories pertain to air travel and aircraft. Incidents such as the 1955 bombing of the Kashmir Princess, the 1985 Arrow Air Flight 1285 crash, the 1986 Mozambican Tupolev Tu-134 crash, the 1987 Helderberg Disaster, the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 and the 1994 Mull of Kintyre helicopter crash as well as various aircraft technologies and alleged sightings, have all spawned theories of foul play which deviate from official verdicts.\n\nThis conspiracy theory emerged in the U.S. in the 1960s. The John Birch Society, who asserted that a United Nations force would soon arrive in black helicopters to bring the U.S. under UN control, originally promoted it. The theory re-emerged in the 1990s, under the presidency of Bill Clinton, and has been promoted by talk show host Glenn Beck. A similar theory concerning so-called \"phantom helicopters\" appeared in the UK in the 1970s.\n\nAlso known as SLAP (Secret Large-scale Atmospheric Program), this theory alleges that water condensation trails (\"contrails\") from aircraft consist of chemical or biological agents, or contain a supposedly toxic mix of aluminum, strontium and barium, under secret government policies. An estimated 17% of people globally believe the theory to be true or partly true. In 2016, the Carnegie Institution for Science published the first-ever peer-reviewed study of the chemtrail theory; 76 out of 77 participating atmospheric chemists and geochemists stated that they had seen no evidence to support the chemtrail theory, or stated that chemtrail theorists rely on poor sampling.\n\nThe destruction of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 by Soviet jets in 1983 has long drawn the interest of conspiracy theorists. The theories range from allegations of a planned espionage mission, to a US government cover-up, to the consumption of the passengers' remains by giant crabs.\n\nThe disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in southeast Asia in March 2014 has prompted many theories. One theory suggests that this plane was hidden away and reintroduced as Flight MH17 later the same year in order to be shot down over Ukraine for political purposes. Prolific American conspiracy theorist James H. Fetzer has placed responsibility for the disappearance with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Theories have also related to allegations that a certain autopilot technology was secretly fitted to the aircraft.\n\nMalaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over Ukraine by Russia-backed rebels or by the Russian military in July 2014. This event has spawned numerous alternative theories. These variously include allegations that it was secretly Flight MH370, that the plane was actually shot down by the Ukrainian Air Force to frame Russia, that it was part of a conspiracy to conceal the \"truth\" about HIV (seven disease specialists were on board), or that the Illuminati or Israel was responsible.\n\nMultiple conspiracy theories pertain to a fatal oil-rig industrial accident in 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico, alleging sabotage by those seeking to promote environmentalism, or a strike by North Korean or Russian submarines. Elements of such theories have been suggested or promoted by US radio host Rush Limbaugh.\n\nA theory claims that The Coca-Cola Company intentionally changed to an inferior formula with New Coke, with the intent either of driving up demand for the original product or permitting the reintroduction of the original with a new formula using cheaper ingredients. Coca-Cola president Donald Keough rebutted this charge: \"The truth is, we're not \"that\" dumb, and we're not that \"smart.\"\"\n\nConspiracy theories frequently emerge following the deaths of prominent leaders and public figures. In ancient times, widespread conspiracy theories were circulated pertaining to the death of the Roman emperor Nero, who committed suicide in 68 AD. Some of these theories claimed that Nero had actually faked his death and was secretly still alive, but in hiding, plotting to return and reestablish his reign. In most of these stories, he was said to have fled to the East, where he was still loved and admired. Other theories held that Nero really was dead, but that he would return from the dead to retake his throne. Many early Christians believed in these conspiracy theories and feared Nero's return because Nero had viciously persecuted them. The Book of Revelation alludes to the conspiracy theories surrounding Nero's alleged return in its description of the slaughtered head returned to life.\nToday, there are many conspiracy theories concerning the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963. Vincent Bugliosi estimates that over 1,000 books have been written about the Kennedy assassination, at least ninety percent of which are works supporting the view that there was a conspiracy. As a result of this, the Kennedy assassination has been described as \"the mother of all conspiracies\". The countless individuals and organizations that have been accused of involvement in the Kennedy assassination include the CIA, the Mafia, sitting Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro, the KGB, or even some combination thereof. It is also frequently asserted that the United States federal government intentionally covered up crucial information in the aftermath of the assassination to prevent the conspiracy from being discovered.\n\nThe deaths of prominent figures of all types attract conspiracy theorists, including, for example, the deaths of US President Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King, Jr., Eric V, Dmitry Ivanovich, Sheikh Rahman, Yitzhak Rabin, Zachary Taylor, George S. Patton, Diana, Princess of Wales, Dag Hammarskjöld, and David Kelly.\n\nAlso popular are theories about the deaths of celebrities, especially musicians. Notable among such theories has been the long-running \"Paul is dead\" theory, which alleges that Paul McCartney died in 1966 and was replaced by a look-alike.\n\nInverted theories concerning deaths are also popular, prominent among which are claims that Elvis Presley's death was faked, and that Adolf Hitler survived the Second World War and fled to the Americas, to Antarctica, or to the moon. Theories that Adolf Hitler had survived were deliberately promoted by the government of the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin as part of a disinformation campaign.\n\nThe disappearance, and often presumed death, of an individual may also become a cause for conspiracy theorists. Theories of a cover-up surrounding the 1974 disappearance of Lord Lucan following the murder of his family's nanny include, for example, allegations of a suicide plot whereby his body was fed to tigers at Howletts Zoo.\n\nNumerous persistent conspiracy theories have also attended the 2007 disappearance of English girl Madeleine McCann.\n\nThe murder of Democratic National Committee employee Seth Rich spawned several right-wing conspiracy theories, including the claim that Rich had been involved with the leaked DNC emails in 2016, which runs contrary to the U.S. intelligence's conclusion the leaked DNC emails were part of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Law enforcement as well as fact-checking websites like PolitiFact.com, Snopes.com, and FactCheck.org stated that these theories were false and unfounded. \"The New York Times\", \"Los Angeles Times\", and \"The Washington Post\" called the fabrications fake news and falsehoods.\n\nThe New World Order theory states that a group of international elites controls governments, industry, and media organizations, with the goal of establishing global hegemony. They are alleged to be implicated in most of the major wars of the last two centuries, to carry out secretly staged events, and to deliberately manipulate economies. Organizations alleged to be part of the plot include the Federal Reserve System, the Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission, the Bilderberg Group, the European Union, the United Nations, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, Bohemian Grove, Le Cercle and Yale University society Skull and Bones.\n\nThe Discordian hoax has resulted in one of the world's foremost conspiracy theories, which claims that the \"Illuminati\" are secretly promoting the posited New World Order. Theorists believe that a wide range of musicians, including Beyoncé and Whitney Houston, have been associated with the \"group\". Prominent theorists include Mark Dice and David Icke.\n\nSome theorists believe that Denver International Airport stands above an underground city which serves as a headquarters of the New World Order. Theorists cite the airport's unusually large size, its distance from Denver city center, as well as assorted alleged Masonic or Satanic symbols, and a set of murals which include depictions of war and death.\n\nHungarian-American investor George Soros has been the subject of conspiracy theories since the 1990s. Soros has used his wealth to promote various political, social, educational and scientific causes, grants totaling an estimated $11 billion up to 2016. However, theories tend to assert that Soros is in control of a large portion of the world's wealth and governments, and that he secretly funds a large range of persons and organizations for nefarious purposes, such as Antifa, which the conspiracies allege to be a single far-left militant group. Such ideas have been promoted by Donald Trump,\nBill O'Reilly, Roy Moore, Alex Jones, Arizona Congressman Paul Gosar, Breitbart News and cartoonist Ben Garrison. Soros conspiracy theories are sometimes linked to antisemitic conspiracy theories.\n\nConspiracy theories concerning the Freemasons have proliferated since the 18th century. Theorists have alleged that Freemasons control large parts of the economies or judiciaries of a number of countries, and have alleged Masonic involvement in events surrounding the sinking of the \"Titanic\" and the crimes of Jack the Ripper. Notable among theorists has been American inventor Samuel Morse, who in 1835 published a book of his own conspiracy theories. Freemason conspiracy theories have also been linked to certain antisemitic conspiracy theories.\n\nConspiracy theories in Turkey started to dominate public discourse during the late reign of the Justice and Development Party and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. In 2014, Erdoğan coined the term \"üst akıl\" (\"mastermind\") to denote the alleged command and control institution, somewhat ambiguously placed with the government of the United States, in a comprehensive conspiracy to weaken or even dismember Turkey, by orchestrating every political actor and action perceived hostile by Turkey. Erdoğan as well as the Daily Sabah have on multiple occasions alleged that very different non-state actors—like the Salafi jihadist Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), the libertarian socialist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and supporters of Fethullah Gülen—were attacking Turkey at the same time in a well-coordinated campaign.\n\nOne instance of promoting the \"mastermind\" conspiracy theory occurred in February 2017, when then-Ankara Mayor Melih Gökçek claimed that earthquakes in the western province of Çanakkale could have been organized by dark external powers aiming to destroy Turkey's economy with an \"artificial earthquake\" near Istanbul. In another example, in November 2017, the Islamist newspaper \"Yeni Akit\" claimed that the fashion trend of \"ripped denim\" jeans was in fact a means of communication, via specific forms of rips and holes, between agents of foreign states and their collaborators in Turkey.\n\nConspiracy theories exist alleging that Israel uses animals to conduct espionage or to attack people. These are often associated with conspiracy theories about Zionism. Matters of interest to theorists include a series of shark attacks in Egypt in 2010, Hezbollah's accusations of the use of \"spying\" eagles, and the 2011 capture of a griffon vulture carrying an Israeli-labeled satellite tracking device.\n\nNumerous persons, including former MI5 officer Peter Wright and Soviet defector Anatoliy Golitsyn, have alleged that British Prime Minister Harold Wilson was secretly a KGB spy. Historian Christopher Andrew has lamented that a number of people have been \"seduced by Golitsyn's fantasies\".\n\nConspiracy theories concerning Malala Yousafzai are widespread in Pakistan, elements of which originate from a 2013 satirical piece in \"Dawn\". These theories variously allege that she is a Western spy, or that her attempted murder by the Taliban in 2012 was a secret operation to further discredit the Taliban, and was organized by her father and the CIA and carried out by actor Robert de Niro disguised as an Uzbek homeopath.\n\nConspiracy theories have arisen in this case because of alleged inconsistencies in the evidence presented by the British government. One example is Craig Murray's blog.\n\nSince at least the Middle Ages, antisemitism has featured elements of conspiracy theory. In medieval Europe it was widely believed that Jews poisoned wells, had been responsible for the death of Jesus, and ritually consumed the blood of Christians. The second half of the 19th century saw the emergence of notions that Jews and/or Freemasons were plotting to establish control over the world. Forged evidence has been presented to spread the notion that Jews were responsible for the propagation of Communism, the most notorious example being \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\" (1903). Such antisemitic conspiracy theories became central to the worldview of Adolf Hitler. Antisemitic theories persist today in notions concerning banking, Hollywood, the news media and a purported Zionist Occupation Government.\n\nHolocaust denial is also considered an antisemitic conspiracy theory because of its position that the Holocaust is a hoax designed to advance the interests of Jews and justify the creation of the State of Israel. Notable Holocaust deniers include former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad, the convicted chemist Germar Rudolf and the discredited author David Irving.\n\nConspiracy theories which allege that the Armenians wield secret political power are prevalent in Azerbaijan, and have been promoted by President Ilham Aliyev.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu has claimed that the Russian media is run by Armenians. American writer and disbarred lawyer Samuel Weems has claimed that the Armenian Genocide was a hoax designed to defraud Christian nations of billions of dollars, and that the Armenian Church instigates terrorist attacks. Filmmaker Davud Imanov has accused the Armenians of plotting against Azerbaijan and has claimed that the Karabakh movement was a plot by the CIA to destroy the Soviet Union.\n\nJournalist Arzu Geybulla has drawn attention to the way in which such theories are used to stifle political dissent.\n\nIran's Baha'i minority has been the target of conspiracy theories alleging involvement with hostile powers. Iranian government officials and others have claimed that Bahá'ís have been agents variously of Russian imperialism, British colonialism, American expansionism and Zionism. An apocryphal and historically-inaccurate book published in Iran, entitled \"The Memoirs of Count Dolgoruki\", details a theory that the Bahá'ís intend to destroy Islam. Such anti-Bahá'í accusations have been dismissed as having no factual foundation.\n\nAnti-Catholic paranoia has featured in the Protestant mind since the Reformation. Conspiracy theories have taken many forms, including the 17th-century Popish Plot allegations, claims by persons such as William Blackstone that Catholics posed a secret threat to Britain, and numerous writings by authors such as Samuel Morse, Rebecca Reed, Avro Manhattan, Jack Chick and Alberto Rivera. Theorists often claim that the pope is the Antichrist, or they accuse Catholics of suppressing evidence incompatible with Church teachings and engaging in secret evil rituals, crimes and other plots.\n\nIn 1853, the Scottish minister Alexander Hislop published his anti-Catholic pamphlet \"The Two Babylons\", in which he claims that the Catholic Church is secretly a continuation of the pagan religion of ancient Babylon, the product of a millennia-old conspiracy founded by the Biblical king Nimrod and the Assyrian queen Semiramis. It also claims that modern Catholic holidays, including Christmas and Easter, are actually pagan festivals established by Semiramis and that the customs associated with them are pagan rituals. Modern scholars have unanimously rejected the book's arguments as erroneous and based on a flawed understanding of Babylonian religion, but variations of them are still accepted among some groups of evangelical Protestants. Jehovah's Witnesses periodical \"The Watchtower\" frequently published excerpts from it until the 1980s. The book's thesis has also featured prominently in the conspiracy theories of racist groups, such as The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord.\n\nFears of a Catholic takeover of the US have been especially persistent, prompted by phenomena such as Catholic immigration in the 19th century, and Ku Klux Klan propaganda. Such fears have attached to Catholic political candidates such as Al Smith and John F. Kennedy.\n\nPope John Paul I died in September 1978, only a month after his election to the papacy. The timing of his death and the Vatican's alleged difficulties with ceremonial and legal death procedures has fostered several conspiracy theories.\n\nThe elderly Pope Benedict XVI's resignation in February 2013, for given reasons of a \"lack of strength of mind and body\", prompted theories in Italian publications such as \"La Repubblica\" and \"Panorama\" that he resigned in order to avoid an alleged scandal involving an underground gay Catholic network.\n\nApocalyptic prophecies, particularly Christian claims about the End Times, have inspired a range of conspiracy theories. Many of these cite the Antichrist, a leader who will supposedly create an oppressive world empire. Countless figures have been called Antichrist, including Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, Russian emperor Peter the Great, Saladin, Pope John XXII, Benito Mussolini and Barack Obama.\n\nBible conspiracy theories posit that significant parts of the New Testament are false, or have been omitted. Various groups both real (such as the Vatican) and fake (such as the Priory of Sion) are said to suppress relevant information concerning, for example, the dating of the Turin Shroud.\n\nMuch of this line of conspiracy theory has been stimulated by a debunked book titled \"The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail\" (1982), which claimed that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were lovers and that their offspring and descendants were secretly hidden in Europe following the death of Jesus, from whom the then-living French draughtsman Pierre Plantard claimed descent. Interest in this hoax saw a resurgence following the publication of Dan Brown's 2003 novel, \"The Da Vinci Code\".\n\n\"War against Islam\" is a conspiracy theory in Islamist discourse which describes an alleged plot to either harm or annihilate the social system within Islam. The perpetrators of this conspiracy are alleged to be non-Muslims and \"false Muslims\", allegedly in collusion with political actors in the Western world. The \"War against Islam\" theory is often used in order to refer to modern social problems and changes, but the Crusades are often seen as its starting point.\n\nSince the September 11 Attacks, many anti-Islamic conspiracy theories have emerged, concerning a variety of topics. Love Jihad, also called Romeo Jihad, refers to a conspiracy theory concerning Muslim males who are said to target non-Muslim girls for conversion to Islam by feigning love. The \"Eurabia\" theory alleges a massive Muslim plot to islamize Europe (and often the rest of the western world) through mass immigration and high birth rates. In addition, before and during his presidency, US President Barack Obama was accused by opponents of secretly being a Muslim.\n\nIn the United States, black genocide conspiracy theory holds the view that African Americans are the victims of genocide instituted by white Americans. Lynchings and racial discrimination were formally described as genocide by the Civil Rights Congress in 1951. Malcolm X also talked about \"black genocide\" in the early 1960s. Public funding of the Pill was also described as \"black genocide\" at the first Black Power Conference, in 1967. In 1970, after abortion was more widely legalized, some black militants depicted abortion as being part of the conspiracy.\n\nIn some U.S. cities that are governed by African American majorities, such as Washington, D.C., a persistent conspiracy theory holds that white Americans are plotting to take over those cities.\n\nWhite genocide conspiracy theory is a white nationalist notion that immigration, integration, low fertility rates and abortion are being promoted in predominantly white countries in order to turn white people into a minority or cause their extinction. A 2017 study in France by IFOP, for example, found that 48% of participants believed without evidence that political and media elites are conspiring to replace white people with immigrants.\n\nSome Rastafari maintain the view that a white racist patriarchy (\"Babylon\") controls the world in order to oppress black people. They believe that Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia did not die in 1975, instead believing that the allegedly racist media propagated false reports of his death in order to quash the Rastafari movement.\n\nAmong the foremost concerns of conspiracy theorists are questions of alien life; for example, allegations of government cover-ups of the supposed Roswell UFO incident or activity at Area 51. Also popular are theories concerning so-called 'men in black', who allegedly silence witnesses.\nMany reports of dead cattle found with absent body parts and seemingly drained of blood have emerged worldwide since at least the 1960s. This phenomenon has spawned theories variously concerning aliens and secret government or military experiments. Prominent among such theorists is Linda Moulton Howe, author of \"Alien Harvest\" (1989).\n\nMany conspiracy theories have drawn inspiration from the writings of ancient astronaut proponent Zecharia Sitchin, who declared that the Anunnaki from Sumerian mythology were actually a race of extraterrestrial beings who came to Earth around 500,000 years ago in order to mine gold. In his 1994 book \"Humanity's Extraterrestrial Origins: ET Influences on Humankind's Biological and Cultural Evolution\", Arthur Horn proposed that the Anunnaki were a race of blood-drinking, shape-shifting alien reptiles. This theory was adapted and elaborated on by British conspiracy theorist David Icke, who maintains that the Bush family, Margaret Thatcher, Bob Hope, and the British Royal Family, among others, are or were such creatures, or have been under their control. Critics have suggested that 'reptilians' may be seen as an antisemitic code word; a charge denied by Icke.\n\nIn the modern era, political conspiracy theories are often spread using fake news on social media. A 2017 study of fake news published by the Shorenstein Center found that \"misinformation is currently predominantly a pathology of the right\".\n\nPolitical conspiracy theories may take generalized and wide-ranging forms concerning wars and international bodies, but may also be seen at a localized level, such as the conspiracy theory pertaining to the 118th Battalion, a British regiment stationed in Kitchener, Ontario during World War I, which is believed by some in Kitchener to still be present and controlling local politics.\n\nConspiracy theories concerning the Illuminati, a short-lived 18th-century Enlightenment society, appear to have originated in the late 19th century, when some conservatives in Europe came to believe that the group had been responsible for the French Revolution of 1789–1799. Hoaxes about the Illuminati were later spread in the 1960s by a group of American practical jokers known as the Discordians, who, for example, wrote a series of fake letters about the Illuminati to \"Playboy\".\n\nFalse flag operations are covert operations designed to appear as if they are being carried out by other entities. Some allegations of false flag operations have been verified or have been subjects of legitimate historical dispute (such as the 1933 Reichstag arson attack). Discussions of unsubstantiated allegations of such operations feature strongly in conspiracy theory discourse.\n\nOther allegations of similar operations have attached to the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the Oklahoma City bombing, the 2004 Madrid train bombings, and the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident.\n\nThe rise of ISIS gave rise to conspiracy theories that it had been created by the US, CIA, Mossad, or Hillary Clinton. The same happened after the rise of Boko Haram.\n\nThe multiple attacks made on the US by terrorists using hijacked aircraft on 11 September 2001 have proved especially attractive to conspiracy theorists. Theories may include reference to missile or hologram technology. By far, the most popular theory is that the attacks were in fact controlled demolitions, a theory which has been rejected by the engineering profession and the 9/11 Commission.\n\nA 2012 fatal mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, prompted numerous conspiracy theories, among which is the claim that it was a manufactured event with the aim of promoting gun control. Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke has theorized that 'Zionists' were responsible. Theorists such as Alex Jones have suggested that the event was staged with actors. Harassment of the bereaved families by conspiracy theorists has resulted in a number of prosecutions. Rush Limbaugh also stated that the event happened because the Mayan Calendar phenomenon made shooter Adam Lanza do it.\n\nA discredited theory, parts of which have been advanced by Christopher Ruddy among others, asserts that former US President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary Clinton have assassinated fifty or more of their associates. The \"Lakeland Ledger\", the \"Chicago Tribune\" and Snopes.com have debunked this theory, pointing to detailed death records, the unusually large circle of associates that a President is likely to have, and the facts that many of the people listed had no known link to the Clintons, or had been misidentified, or were still alive.\n\nThe unsolved 2016 murder of DNC staff member Seth Rich has prompted conspiracy theorists to claim that his killing was instigated by Hillary Clinton following alleged collaboration with WikiLeaks during the 2016 United States presidential campaign. Elements of this story have been promoted by figures including Alex Jones, Newt Gingrich, and Sean Hannity as an alternative theory to Russian interference in the election.\n\nPizzagate is a debunked conspiracy theory that emerged during the 2016 United States presidential election, connecting a pizza restaurant and members of the Democratic Party with a non-existent child-sex ring. It has been comprehensively discredited by numerous bodies including the District of Columbia Police Department, Snopes.com, \"The New York Times\", and Fox News.\n\nFormer US President Obama has been the subject of numerous conspiracy theories. His presidency was the subject of a 2009 film, \"The Obama Deception\", by Alex Jones, which alleged that Obama's administration was a puppet government for a wealthy elite. Another theory which came to prominence in 2009 (known as \"birtherism\") denies the legitimacy of Obama's presidency by claiming that he was not born in the US. This theory has persisted despite the evidence of his Hawaiian birth certificate and of contemporary birth announcements in two Hawaiian newspapers in 1961. Notable promoters of the theory are dentist-lawyer Orly Taitz and President Donald Trump, who has since publicly acknowledged its falsity but is said to continue to advocate for it privately. Other theories claim that Obama, a Protestant Christian, is secretly a Muslim.\n\nA pair of fatal attacks on US government facilities in Benghazi, Libya, by Islamist terrorists in 2012 has spawned numerous conspiracy theories, including allegations that Obama's administration arranged the attack for political reasons, and Senator Rand Paul's repeated assertion that the government's response to the incident was designed to distract from a secret CIA operation.\n\nThe United States' Federal Emergency Management Agency is the subject of many theories, including the allegation that the organization has been engaged in the building of concentration camps on US soil, in advance of the imposition of martial law and genocide.\n\nMembers of South Africa's African National Congress party have long propagated conspiracy theories, frequently concerning the CIA and alleged white supremacists. In 2014, Deputy Minister of Defence Kebby Maphatsoe joined others in accusing without evidence Public Protector Thuli Madonsela of being a US agent working to create a puppet government in South Africa.\n\nThe intellectual group known as the Frankfurt School which emerged in the 1930s has increasingly been the subject of conspiracy theories which have alleged the promotion of communism in capitalist societies. The term 'Cultural Marxism' has been notably employed by conservative American movements such as the Tea Party, and by Norwegian mass-murderer Anders Breivik.\n\nOccasionally used as a neutral term to denote a nation's bureaucracy, the conspiratorial notion of a \"deep state\" is a concept originating principally in Middle Eastern and North African politics with some basis in truth, and has been known in the US since the 1960s. It has since come to prominence under the Trump presidency. \"Deep state\" in the latter sense refers to an unidentified \"power elite\" who act in co-ordinated manipulation of a nation's politics and government. Proponents of such theories have included Canadian author Peter Dale Scott, who has promoted the idea in the US since at least the 1990s, as well as Breitbart News, Infowars and US President Donald Trump. A 2017 poll by ABC News and \"The Washington Post\" indicated that 48% of Americans believe in the existence of a conspiratorial \"deep state\" in the US.\n\nThe 2017 Sutherland Springs church shooting has also been the subject of multiple conspiracy theories. The shooter has been linked to multiple conspiracies, such as identifying him as a Democrat, Hillary Clinton supporter, Bernie Sanders supporter, \"alt-left\" supporter, Antifa member, or radical Muslim; or claiming that he carried an Antifa flag and told churchgoers: \"This is a communist revolution\". Some reports also falsely claimed that he targeted the church because they were \"white conservatives\".\n\nA 2013 study approved by the University of Chicago suggested that almost half of Americans believe at least one medical conspiracy theory, with 37% believing that the Food and Drug Administration deliberately suppresses 'natural' cures due to influence from the pharmaceutical industry. A prominent proponent of comparable conspiracy theories has been convicted fraudster Kevin Trudeau.\n\nScientists have found evidence that HIV was transferred from monkeys to humans in the 1930s. Evidence exists, however, that the KGB deliberately disseminated a notion in the 1980s that it was invented by the CIA. This idea, and similar ideas concerning Ebola, have since been promoted by persons such as actor Steven Seagal, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan and former South Africa President Thabo Mbeki. Similar conspiracy theories allege that pharmaceutical companies assist in the creation of conditions and diseases including ADHD, HSV and HPV.\n\nWater fluoridation is the controlled addition of fluoride to a public water supply to reduce tooth decay. Although many dental-health organizations support such fluoridation, the practice is opposed by conspiracy theorists. Allegations may include claims that it has been a way to dispose of industrial waste, or that it exists to obscure a failure to provide dental care to the poor. A further theory promoted by the John Birch Society in the 1960s described fluoridation as a communist plot to weaken the American population.\n\nA popular conspiracy theory states that the pharmaceutical industry has mounted a cover-up of a causal link between vaccines and autism. The theory took hold with the publication in 1998 of a fraudulent paper by discredited former doctor Andrew Wakefield. The resulting anti-vaccine movement has been promoted by a number of prominent persons including Rob Schneider, Jim Carrey and President Donald Trump, and has led to increased rates of infection and death from diseases such as measles in many countries, including the US, Italy, Germany, Romania and the UK.\n\nVaccine conspiracy theories have been widespread in Nigeria since at least 2003, as well as in Pakistan. Such theories may feature claims that vaccines are part of a secret anti-Islam plot, and have been linked to fatal mass shootings and bombings at vaccine clinics in both countries.\n\nGlobal warming conspiracy theorists typically allege that the science behind global warming has been invented or distorted for ideological or financial reasons. Many have promoted such theories, including US President Donald Trump, US Senator James Inhofe, British journalist Christopher Booker, and Viscount Christopher Monckton.\n\nNumerous theories pertain to real or alleged weather-controlling projects. Theories include the debunked assertion that HAARP, a radio-technology research program funded by the US government, is a secret weather-controlling system. Some theorists have blamed 2005's Hurricane Katrina on HAARP. HAARP has also been suggested to have somehow caused earthquakes, such as the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami or the 2013 Saravan earthquake. Theories concerning HAARP may also refer to mind-control technology.\n\nAlso of interest to conspiracy theorists are cloud-seeding technologies. These include a debunked allegation that the British military's Project Cumulus caused the fatal 1952 Lynmouth Flood in Devon, England, and claims concerning a secret project said to have caused the 2010 Pakistan floods.\n\nGenuine American research in the 1950s and 1960s into chemical interrogation and mind-control techniques has prompted many subsequent conspiracy theories, especially following CIA Director Richard Helm's 1973 order to destroy all files related to the project. These theories include the allegation that the mass fatality at Jonestown in 1978 was connected to an MKUltra experiment.\n\nRadio frequency identification chips (RFID), such as are implanted into pets as a means of tracking, have drawn the interest of conspiracy theorists who posit that this technology is secretly in widespread use on humans. Former Whitby town councilor Simon Parkes has promoted this theory, which may be related to conspiracy theories concerning vaccination, electronic banking and the Antichrist.\n\nFlat Earth theory first emerged in 19th-century England, despite the Earth's spherical nature having been known since at least the time of Pythagoras. It has in recent years been promoted by American software consultant Mark Sargent through the use of YouTube videos. Flat-earther conspiracy theorists hold that planet Earth is not a sphere, and that evidence has been faked or suppressed to hide the fact that is instead a disc, or a single infinite plane. The conspiracy often implicates NASA. Other claims may include such allegations as that GPS devices are rigged to make aircraft pilots wrongly believe they are flying around a globe.\n\nNumerous theories pertain to the alleged suppression of certain technologies and energies. Such theories may focus on the Vril Society Conspiracy, allegations of the suppression of the electric car by fossil-fuel companies (as detailed in the 2006 documentary \"Who Killed the Electric Car?\"), and the Phoebus cartel, set up in 1924, which has been accused of suppressing longer-lasting light bulbs. Other long-standing allegations include the suppression of perpetual motion and cold fusion technology by government agencies, special interest groups, or fraudulent inventors.\n\nPromoters of alternative energy theories have included Thomas Henry Moray, Eugene Mallove, and convicted American fraudster Stanley Meyer.\n\nConspiracy theorists often attend to new military technologies, both real and imagined. Subjects of theories include: the alleged Philadelphia Experiment, a supposed attempt to turn a U.S. Navy warship invisible; the alleged Montauk Project, a supposed government program to learn about mind control and time travel; and the so-called Tsunami bomb which is alleged to have caused the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.\n\nOther theories include Peter Vogel's debunked claim that an accidental explosion of conventional munitions at Port Chicago was in fact a nuclear detonation, and a theory promoted by the Venezuelan state-run TV station ViVe that the 2010 Haiti earthquake was caused by a secret US \"earthquake weapon\".\n\nSome theories claim that the dates of historical events have been deliberately distorted. These include the phantom time hypothesis of German conspiracy theorist Heribert Illig, who in 1991 published an allegation that 297 years had been added to the calendar by establishment figures such as Pope Sylvester II in order to position themselves at the millennium.\n\nA comparable theory, known as the New Chronology, is most closely associated with Russian theorist Anatoly Fomenko. Fomenko holds that history is many centuries shorter than is widely believed and that numerous historical documents have been fabricated, and legitimate documents destroyed, for political ends. Adherents of such ideas have included chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov.\n\nScientific space programs are of particular interest to conspiracy theorists. The most prolific theories allege that the US moon landings were staged by NASA in a film studio, with some alleging the involvement of director Stanley Kubrick. The Soviet space program has also attracted theories that the government concealed evidence of failed flights. A more recent theory, emergent following the activities of hacker Gary McKinnon, suggests that a secret program of manned space fleets known as Solar Warden exists, supposedly acting under the United Nations.\n\nConspiracy theorists have long posited a plot by organizations such as NASA to conceal the existence of a large planet in the Solar System known as Nibiru or Planet X, which allegedly, will one day pass close enough to the Earth to destroy it. Predictions for the date of destruction have included 2003, 2012 and 2017. The theory began to develop following the publication of \"The 12th Planet\" (1976), by discredited Russian-American author Zecharia Sitchin, was given its full form by Nancy Lieder, and has since been promoted by American conspiracy theorist and End Times theorist David Meade. The notion has remained popular, and received renewed attention during the period prior to the solar eclipse of 21 August 2017. Other conspiracy theorists in 2017 also predicted Nibiru would appear, including Terral Croft and YouTube pastor Paul Begley.\n\nBoxing has featured in conspiracy theories, such as the claims that the second Ali-Liston fight and the first Bradley-Pacquiao fight were fixed.\n\nThe notorious theft and disappearance of the Irish-bred racehorse Shergar in 1983 has prompted many conspiracy theorists to speculate about involvement by the Mafia, the IRA and Colonel Gaddafi.\n\nThe \"frozen envelope theory\" suggests that the National Basketball Association rigged its 1985 draft Lottery so that Patrick Ewing would join the New York Knicks. Theorists claim that a lottery envelope was chilled so that it could be identified by touch. A similar \"hot balls theory\", promoted by Scottish football manager David Moyes, suggests that certain balls used in draws for UEFA competitions have been warmed to achieve specific outcomes.\n\nThe 1984 Pepsi 400 at Daytona, Florida, was the first NASCAR race to be attended by a sitting US President, Ronald Reagan, and was driver Richard Petty's 200th victory. Rival driver Cale Yarborough's premature retirement to the pit road has prompted conspiracy theorists to allege that organizers fixed the race in order to receive good publicity for the event.\n\nOn the day of the 1998 World Cup Final, Brazilian striker Ronaldo suffered a convulsive fit. Ronaldo was initially removed from the starting lineup 72 minutes before the match, with the teamsheet released to a stunned world media, before he was reinstated by the Brazil coach shortly before kick off. Ronaldo \"sleepwalked\" through the final, with France winning the game. The nature of the incident set off a trail of questions and allegations which persisted for years, with Alex Bellos writing in \"The Guardian\", \"When Ronaldo's health scare was revealed after the match, the situation's unique circumstances lent itself to fabulous conspiracy theories. Here was the world's most famous sportsman, about to take part in the most important match of his career, when he suddenly, inexplicably, fell ill. Was it stress, epilepsy, or had he been drugged?\". Questions also circulated into who made Ronaldo play the game. The Brazil coach insisted he had the final say, but much speculation focused on sportswear company Nike, Brazil's multimillion-dollar sponsor—whom many Brazilians thought had too much control—putting pressure on the striker to play against medical advice.\n\nThe New England Patriots have also been involved in numerous conspiracy theories. During their AFC Championship over the Jacksonville Jaguars, several conspiracy theories spread stating that the referees helped the Patriots advance to Super Bowl LII. However, sports analyst Stephen A. Smith stated the Jaguars were not robbed, but that they had no one to blame but themselves for the loss. There were also conspiracy theories regarding the Super Bowl LI matchup between the Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons stating that the game was rigged while others said the Falcons made questionable play-calls at the end of the game.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "332773", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=332773", "title": "List of writing systems", "text": "List of writing systems\n\nThis is a list of writing systems (or scripts), classified according to some common distinguishing features. There are at least 3,866 languages that make use of an established writing system.\n\nThe usual name of the script is given first; the name of the language(s) in which the script is written follows (in brackets), particularly in the case where the language name differs from the script name. Other informative or qualifying annotations for the script may also be provided.\n\nIdeographic scripts (in which graphemes are ideograms representing concepts or ideas, rather than a specific word in a language), and pictographic scripts (in which the graphemes are iconic pictures) are not thought to be able to express all that can be communicated by language, as argued by the linguists John DeFrancis and J. Marshall Unger. Essentially, they postulate that no \"full\" writing system can be completely pictographic or ideographic; it must be able to refer directly to a language in order to have the full expressive capacity of a language. Unger disputes claims made on behalf of Blissymbols in his 2004 book \"Ideogram\".\n\nAlthough a few pictographic or ideographic scripts exist today, there is no single way to read them, because there is no one-to-one correspondence between symbol and language. Hieroglyphs were commonly thought to be ideographic before they were translated, and to this day Chinese is often erroneously said to be ideographic. In some cases of ideographic scripts, only the author of a text can read it with any certainty, and it may be said that they are \"interpreted\" rather than read. Such scripts often work best as mnemonic aids for oral texts, or as outlines that will be fleshed out in speech.\n\n\nThere are also symbol systems used to represent things other than language, or to represent constructed languages. Some of these are\n\nLinear B and Asemic writing also incorporate ideograms.\n\nIn logographic writing systems, glyphs represent words or morphemes (meaningful components of words, as in \"mean-ing-ful\"), rather than phonetic elements.\n\nNote that no logographic script is composed solely of logograms. All contain graphemes that represent phonetic (sound-based) elements as well. These phonetic elements may be used on their own (to represent, for example, grammatical inflections or foreign words), or may serve as phonetic complements to a logogram (used to specify the sound of a logogram that might otherwise represent more than one word). In the case of Chinese, the phonetic element is built into the logogram itself; in Egyptian and Mayan, many glyphs are purely phonetic, whereas others function as either logograms or phonetic elements, depending on context. For this reason, many such scripts may be more properly referred to as logosyllabic or complex scripts; the terminology used is largely a product of custom in the field, and is to an extent arbitrary.\n\n\n\nIn a syllabary, graphemes represent syllables or moras. (Note that the 19th-century term \"syllabics\" usually referred to \"abugidas\" rather than true syllabaries.)\n\n\nIn most of these systems, some consonant-vowel combinations are written as syllables, but others are written as consonant plus vowel. In the case of Old Persian, all vowels were written regardless, so it was \"effectively\" a true alphabet despite its syllabic component. In Japanese a similar system plays a minor role in foreign borrowings; for example, [tu] is written [to]+[u], and [ti] as [te]+[i]. Paleohispanic semi-syllabaries behaved as a syllabary for the stop consonants and as an alphabet for the rest of consonants and vowels. The Tartessian or Southwestern script is typologically intermediate between a pure alphabet and the Paleohispanic full semi-syllabaries. Although the letter used to write a stop consonant was determined by the following vowel, as in a full semi-syllabary, the following vowel was also written, as in an alphabet. Some scholars treat Tartessian as a redundant semi-syllabary, others treat it as a redundant alphabet. Zhuyin is semi-syllabic in a different sense: it transcribes half syllables. That is, it has letters for syllable onsets and rimes \"(kan = \"k-an\")\" rather than for consonants and vowels \"(kan = \"k-a-n\").\"\n\n\nA segmental script has graphemes which represent the phonemes (basic unit of sound) of a language.\n\nNote that there need not be (and rarely is) a one-to-one correspondence between the graphemes of the script and the phonemes of a language. A phoneme may be represented only by some combination or string of graphemes, the same phoneme may be represented by more than one distinct grapheme, the same grapheme may stand for more than one phoneme, or some combination of all of the above.\n\nSegmental scripts may be further divided according to the types of phonemes they typically record:\n\nAn abjad is a segmental script containing symbols for consonants only, or where vowels are \"optionally\" written with diacritics (\"pointing\") or only written word-initially.\n\nA true alphabet contains separate letters (not diacritic marks) for both consonants and vowels.\n\n\"Linear\" alphabets are composed of lines on a surface, such as ink on paper.\n\nA featural script has elements that indicate the components of articulation, such as bilabial consonants, fricatives, or back vowels. Scripts differ in how many features they indicate.\n\n\n\nManual alphabets are frequently found as parts of sign languages. They are not used for writing \"per se\", but for spelling out words while signing.\n\nThese are other alphabets composed of something other than lines on a surface.\n\nAn abugida, or \"alphasyllabary\", is a segmental script in which vowel sounds are denoted by diacritical marks or other systematic modification of the consonants. Generally, however, if a single letter is understood to have an inherent unwritten vowel, and only vowels other than this are written, then the system is classified as an alphasyllabary regardless of whether the vowels look like diacritics or full letters. The vast majority of alphasyllabaries are found from India to Southeast Asia and belong historically to the Brāhmī family. The term abugida is derived from the first characters of the abugida in Ge'ez: አ (A) ቡ (bu) ጊ (gi) ዳ (da) — (compare with \"alphabet\"). Unlike abjads, the diacritical marks and systemic modifications of the consonants are not optional.\n\n\n\nIn at least one abugida, not only the vowel but any syllable-final consonant is written with a diacritic. For example, representing [o] with an under-ring, and final [k] with an over-cross, [sok] would be written as .\n\n\nIn a few abugidas, the vowels are basic, and the consonants secondary. If no consonant is written in Pahawh Hmong, it is understood to be /k/; consonants are written after the vowel they precede in speech. In Japanese Braille, the vowels but not the consonants have independent status, and it is the vowels which are modified when the consonant is \"y\" or \"w\".\n\n\nThese systems have not been deciphered. In some cases, such as Meroitic, the sound values of the glyphs are known, but the texts still cannot be read because the language is not understood. Several of these systems, such as Epi-Olmec and Indus, are claimed to have been deciphered, but these claims have not been confirmed by independent researchers. In many cases it is doubtful that they are actually writing. The Vinča symbols appear to be proto-writing, and quipu may have recorded only numerical information. There are doubts that Indus is writing, and the Phaistos Disc has so little content or context that its nature is undetermined.\n\n\nA number of manuscripts exist which may be written in an invented writing system, a cipher of an existing writing system or may only be a hoax.\n\nAsemic writing is generally meaningless, though it sometimes contains ideograms or pictograms.\n\nThis section lists alphabets used to transcribe phonetic or phonemic sound; not to be confused with spelling alphabets like the ICAO spelling alphabet.\n\nAlphabets may exist in forms other than visible symbols on a surface. Some of these are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5856713", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5856713", "title": "Malak-Malak language", "text": "Malak-Malak language\n\nMalak-Malak (also spelt Mullukmulluk, Malagmalag, Malak-Malak) or referred to as \"Ngolak-Wonga, Nguluwongga\" is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken by the Mulluk-Mulluk people. MalakMalak is nearly extinct, with children growing up speaking Kriol or English instead. The language is spoken in the Daly River area around Woolianna and Nauiyu.\n\nMalakMalak has sometimes been classified in a Northern Daly family along with an \"Anson Bay\" group of Wagaydy (Patjtjamalh, Wadjiginy, Kandjerramalh) and the unattested Giyug. Green concluded that Wagaydy and MalakMalak were two separate families. Later researchers have linked them, and this is reflected in Bowern (2011).

These consist of an inflecting verb that has properties of person, number and tense. MalakMalak only has six such verbs. In example (4), \"yuyu\" and \"vida\" are inflecting verbs. Additionally, there are coverbs which have aspectual properties, but do not inflect for number, tense or person. They occur with inflecting verbs. They are unlimited in number and new verbs are also borrowed into this class. In (4), \"kubuk-karrarr, dat-tyed,\" and \"ka\" are coverbs. They can also form serial verbs (\"kubuk-karrarr, dat-tyed\").\n\n(4) Complex Predicates and Serial Coverbs\n\n\"he crossed the river and looked once, then he came here\"\n\nMalakMalak employs all three \"classic\" types of spatial Frames of Reference: intrinsic, relative and absolute. Additionally, the language uses place names and body-part orientation to talk about space. The intrinsic Frame requires some kind of portioning of the ground object or landmark into named facets from which search domains can be projected. In English this would be, for example, \"the tree is in front of the man.\" And in MalakMalak it would be (5).\n\n(5) intrinsic Frame of Reference\n\n\"the tree was behind (the man)\"\n\nThe relative Frame of Reference involves mapping from the observer's own axes (\"front, back, left, right\") onto the ground object. An English example is \"the ball is on the right.\" In MalakMalak it would be (6)\n\n(6) relative Frame of Reference\n\n\"now the ball was on the right, jumping up (lit. jumping in an upward place on the right)\"\n\nThe absolute Frame of Reference requires xed bearings that are instantly available to all members of the community. An English example is \"the opera is west of here.\" In MalakMalak, three different types of absolute frames can be used. Those based on the course of the sun (\"east/west\") (7a), on prevailing winds (\"northwesterly/southeasterly\") (7b), and on two sides of the prominent Daly River (\"northeastern/southwestern bank\") (7c).\n\n\"this one is west and this one is east\"\n\n\"one is facing the river and the other one is facing northwest\"\n\n\"it is underneath, on the northeastern bank's side, of the chair\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "154445", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=154445", "title": "Parka", "text": "Parka\n\nA parka or anorak is a type of coat with a hood, often lined with fur or faux fur. The Caribou Inuit invented this kind of garment, originally made from caribou or seal skin, for hunting and kayaking in the frigid Arctic. Some Inuit anoraks require regular coating with fish oil to retain their water resistance.\n\nThe words \"anorak\" and \"parka\" have been used interchangeably, but they are somewhat different garments. Strictly speaking, an anorak is a waterproof, hooded, pull-over jacket without a front opening, and sometimes drawstrings at the waist and cuffs, and a parka is a hip-length cold-weather coat, typically stuffed with down or very warm synthetic fiber, and with a fur-lined hood.\n\nThe word \"anorak\" comes from the Greenlandic (\"Kalaallisut\") word \"annoraaq\". It did not appear in English until 1924; an early definition is \"a beaded item worn by Greenland women or brides in the 1930s\". In the early 1950s it was made from nylon, but changed to poplin by 1959, when it was featured in \"Vogue\" magazine as a fashion item. In 1984, \"The Observer\" used the term to refer to the type of people who wore it and subsequently, in the United Kingdom, it is sometimes used as a mildly derogatory term.\n\nThe word \"parka\" is derived from the Nenets language. In the Aleutian Islands the word simply means \"animal skin\". It first entered the English written record in a 1625 work by Samuel Purchas.\n\nThe Inuit who speak Inuktitut use parkas and have various terms related to them as follows:\n\nThe original snorkel parka (USAF N-3B parka, which is 3/4 length and has a full, attached hood; the similar N-2B parka is waist-length and has an attached split hood) was developed in the United States during the early 1950s for military use, mainly for flight crews stationed in extremely cold areas. It was designed for use in areas with temperatures as low as to . Originally made with a sage green DuPont flight silk nylon outer and lining it was padded with a wool blanket type material until the mid-1970s when the padding was changed to polyester wadding making the jacket both lighter and warmer. The outer shell material also was changed to a sage green cotton-nylon blend, with respective percentages 80–20, 65–35, and 50–50 being used at various times. \n\nIt gained the common name of \"snorkel parka\" because the hood can be zipped right up leaving only a small tunnel (or snorkel) for the wearer to look out of. This is particularly effective in very cold, windy weather although it has the added liabilities of seriously limiting the field of vision and hearing. Earlier Vietnam-era hoods had genuine fur ruffs; later versions used synthetic furs. Original manufacturers of this parka for the government included Skyline, Southern Athletic, Lancer, Greenbrier, Workroom For Designers, Alpha, and Avirex. \n\nThe basic N-3B parka design was copied and sold to the civilian market by many manufacturers with varying degrees of quality and faithfulness to the original government specifications. Surplus military parkas are often available for relatively low prices online and in surplus stores; they compare quite favorably with civilian extreme-cold parkas of all types due to their robust construction, designed for combat conditions, and warmth. \n\nThe 1970s–1980s civilian version of the parka was made in many colors – navy blue, green, brown, black, maroon, grey, royal blue, sky blue and bright orange. Most had an orange diamond quilted nylon lining, although a very small number did have alternative colored linings such as yellow, pale blue, and green. While still manufacturing parkas to the military standard, Alpha Industries have more recently adopted the orange lining and a slimmer fit when producing their VF59 model parka which is now more popular than the military version.\n\nIn the late 1980s the snorkel parka came to be associated in the UK with trainspotters, who would supposedly wear them, giving birth to the slang term there \"anorak\". \n\nIn Europe the snorkel parka started to regain popularity in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nThe fishtail parka was first used by the United States Army in 1950 during the Korean War. Following the end of the Second World War the US army recognized the need for a new cold weather combat system, resulting in four main styles of fishtail parka: the EX-48, M-48, M-51 and the M-65. The M stands for military, and the number is the year it was standardized. The EX-48 model was the first prototype or \"experimental\" precursor to all of them. \nThe M-48 then being the first actual production model fishtail parka after the pattern being standardized on December 24, 1948.\n\nThe name \"fishtail\" comes from the fish tail extension at the back that could be folded up between the legs, much like a Knochensack, and fixed using snap connectors to add wind-proofing. The fishtail was fixed at the front for warmth or folded away at the back to improve freedom of movement when needed. \n\nThe EX-48 parka is distinctive as it has a left sleeve pocket and is made of thin poplin, only the later production M-48 parkas are made of the heavier sateen canvas type cotton. \nThe EX-48 also has a thin fibre glass based liner that is very light and warm, the M-48 has a thicker wool pile liner with an integral hood liner made of wool. Both are distinguishable from any other type of parka by having the sleeve pocket. This was dropped for the M-51 onward. \nThe fur ruff on the hood is also fixed to the shell of an EX-48/M-48 and is of wolf, coyote or often wolverine. The M-48 parka was costly to produce and therefore only in production for around one year. The pockets were wool lined both inside and out. The cuffs had two buttons for securing tightly around a wearer's wrist. The later more mass-produced M-51 parka had just the one cuff button. The liner had a built in chest pocket which again was unique to the M-48 parka.\n\nThe next revision was the M-51, made because the M48 was so good and of such high quality it was just too expensive to mass-produce.\n\nThe outer hood of the M-51 Fishtail Parka is integral to the parka shell, an added hood liner as well as a button in main liner make the M-51 a versatile 3 piece parka.\nThe idea behind this 3 part system was to enable a more customisable parka that allowed for easier cleaning of the shell as the hood fur was on the detachable hood liner, not fixed to the shell as in the M-48. It also allowed for both liners to be buttoned in or our depending on the temperature and hence warmth required. It was also cheaper than the M-48 to mass-produce\nThe early M-51 was made of heavy sateen cotton, the same material as the M-48. Later revisions of the M-51 were poplin based. The later liners were also revised from the \"heavy when wet\" wool pile to a lighter woolen loop or frieze wool design that dried easier and were far lighter. The frieze liners were constructed of mohair and were designed using a double loop system which repelled cold weather.\n\nThe M-65 fishtail parka has a detachable hood and was the last revision. It features a removable quilted liner made of light nylon / polyester batting which are modern synthetic materials. The M-65 fishtail parka first came into production in 1968.\nThese parkas featured synthetic fur on the hoods after an outcry from the fur lobby. As a result, only hoods for these parkas made in 1972 and for one year later have real fur.\n\nDesigned primarily for combat arms forces such as infantry, they are to be worn over other layers of clothing; alone, the fishtail parka is insufficient to protect against \"dry cold\" conditions (i.e. below about -10 °C). As such all fishtail parkas are big as they were designed to be worn over battle dress and other layers.\n\nIn the 1960s UK, the fishtail parka became a symbol of the mod subculture. Because of their practicality, cheapness and availability from army surplus shops, the parka was seen as the ideal garment for fending off the elements and protecting smarter clothes underneath from grease and dirt when on the mod's vehicle of choice, the scooter. Its place in popular culture was assured by newspaper pictures of parka-clad mods during the Bank Holiday riots of the 1960s.\n\nA cagoule is the British English term for a lightweight, weatherproof anorak or parka, usually unlined and sometimes knee-length. A cagoule could be rolled up into a very compact package and carried in a bag or pocket. It was invented by Noel Bibby of Peter Storm Ltd. in the early 1960s. It may have a full-zippered front opening, or pull over the head like an original anorak and close with snaps or a short zipper, has an integral hood, and elasticated or drawstring cuffs. In some versions, when rolled up, the hood doubles as a bag into which the rest of the coat is pushed. It became very popular in the United Kingdom during the 1970s.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "39148223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39148223", "title": "Prime version", "text": "Prime version\n\nIn the art world, if an artwork exists in several versions, the one known or believed to be the earliest is called the prime version. Many artworks produced in media such as painting or carved sculpture which create unique objects are in fact repeated by their artists, often several times. It is regarded as a matter of some importance both by art historians and the art market to establish which version has \"priority\", that is to say was the original work. The presumption usually is that the prime version is the finest, and perhaps the most carefully done, though some later versions can be argued to improve on the originals. \n\nIn many periods the later \"repetitions\" were often produced by the workshop of the master, with varying degrees of supervision and direct attention from him. This was especially the case with official portraits of monarchs and politicians, which in the Early Modern period were often ordered in large numbers of versions from the court artist as diplomatic gifts. Sometimes \"reduced versions\" that are considerably smaller than the prime one are made. \n\nIn the case of official portraits the later creation of replica versions was likely to have been anticipated from the start, as in other types of art such as printmaking, but in other types of painting, especially history painting, the normal presumption, in the past as today, was that each work was a unique creation. This was a matter of some importance to the owner, and there was evidently in some periods a general understanding that a work should not be replicated or copied without the permission of the owner of the prime version, which needed to be asked for carefully and was not always given. In many periods \"replicas were the direct product of collecting, as collectors have always preferred recognizable masterpieces to what is offbeat\". \n\nThis was true of 17th century Rome, where artists such as Orazio Gentileschi and Bernardo Strozzi routinely made replicas, and others such as Guercino and Guido Reni sometimes did, as of Victorian London, where artists such as William Powell Frith often painted one or more replica versions of their successes. In Frith's case the replicas were painted many years after his first versions, when his newer work was achieving less success. The French painter recorded no fewer than 32 versions of his \"Femme Fellah\", an Orientalist hit at the Paris Salon of 1866. Pieces of sculpture made by casting processes that allow the original model to be reproduced several times are rather different; though the first in an edition (today often kept by the artist) has some added prestige, it is expected that a number of versions will be made.\nAn example of a work now only known from a replica (in the Galleria Borghese in Rome) and studies is \"Aeneas and his Family Fleeing Troy\", the only secular history painting by Federico Barocci. The prime version was given in 1586 by Francesco Maria II, the last Duke of Urbino, to Rudolph II, Holy Roman Emperor in Prague, and was later looted by the Swedes. It was taken to Rome by Queen Christina of Sweden, passed to the Orleans collection in Paris, and finally sold at auction in London for 14 guineas in 1800 (the price probably reflecting the poor condition some sources mention), since when its whereabouts are unknown. The Rome version was painted in 1598, presumably for Cardinal Scipio Borghese.\n\nIn some cases it is evident which version of a work is prime, especially if there is a full provenance including a contract or other documentation of the original commission; a contract for a copy will normally make that clear. Otherwise experts will look both at the overall quality of the work, and also technical elements such as detailed underdrawing and pentimenti (changes of mind) that indicate that the artist was finalizing his idea of the work as he proceeded. Infrared and X-ray photography are among the scientific techniques that may help in discovering these technical issues. Close comparison with the evolving style of other works by the artist and the comparison, ideally physically side by side, between two rival versions will often lead to a clear conclusion, but sometimes arguments between experts may take decades to reach a conclusion, as with other issues of attribution. \n\nOne of the most dramatic reassessments in recent decades, of a very important work, came in 1970 when a new assessment of a version of the \"Portrait of Pope Julius II\" by Raphael drew on a combination of new scientific research and archival knowledge, as x-rays revealed an inventory number from 1693, as well as a background that Raphael had repainted. The version in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, previously considered prime, was replaced by the version in the National Gallery, London, previously considered a replica.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "559297", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=559297", "title": "Proto-Indo-European language", "text": "Proto-Indo-European language\n\nProto-Indo-European (PIE) is the linguistic reconstruction of the common ancestor of the Indo-European languages, the most widely spoken language family in the world.\n\nFar more work has gone into reconstructing PIE than any other proto-language, and it is by far the best understood of all proto-languages of its age. The vast majority of linguistic work during the 19th century was devoted to the reconstruction of PIE or its daughter proto-languages (such as Proto-Germanic), and most of the modern techniques of linguistic reconstruction such as the comparative method were developed as a result. These methods supply all current knowledge concerning PIE since there is no written record of the language.\n\nPIE is estimated to have been spoken as a single language from 4500 BC to 2500 BC during the Late Neolithic to Early Bronze Age, though estimates vary by more than a thousand years. According to the prevailing Kurgan hypothesis, the original homeland of the Proto-Indo-Europeans may have been in the Pontic–Caspian steppe of Eastern Europe. The linguistic reconstruction of PIE has also provided insight into the culture and religion of its speakers.\n\nAs Proto-Indo-Europeans became isolated from each other through the Indo-European migrations, the Proto-Indo-European language became spoken by the various groups in regional dialects which then underwent the Indo-European sound laws divergence, and along with shifts in morphology, these dialects slowly but eventually transformed into the known ancient Indo-European languages. From there, further linguistic divergence led to the evolution of their current descendants, the modern Indo-European languages. Today, the descendant languages, or daughter languages, of PIE with the most native speakers are Spanish, English, Portuguese, Hindustani (Hindi and Urdu), Bengali, Russian, Punjabi, German, Persian, French, Italian and Marathi. Hundreds of other living descendants of PIE range from languages as diverse as Albanian (), Kurdish (), Nepali (), Tsakonian (), Ukrainian (), and Welsh ().\n\nPIE had an elaborate system of morphology that included inflectional suffixes (analogous to English \"life, lives, life's, lives'‍\") as well as ablaut (vowel alterations, for example, as preserved in English \"sing, sang, sung\") and accent. PIE nominals and pronouns had a complex system of declension, and verbs similarly had a complex system of conjugation. The PIE phonology, particles, numerals, and copula are also well-reconstructed.\n\nAn asterisk is used to mark reconstructed words, such as *' 'water', *' 'dog' (English \"hound\"), or *\"\" 'three (masculine)'.\n\nNo direct evidence of PIE remains – scholars have reconstructed PIE from its present-day descendants using the comparative method.\n\nThe comparative method follows the Neogrammarian rule: the Indo-European sound laws apply without exception. The method compares languages and uses the sound laws to find a common ancestor. For example, compare the pairs of words in Italian and English: \"piede\" and \"foot\", \"padre\" and \"father\", \"pesce\" and \"fish\". Since there is a consistent correspondence of the initial consonants that emerges far too frequently to be coincidental, one can assume that these languages stem from a common parent-language.\n\nMany consider William Jones, an Anglo-Welsh philologist and puisne judge in Bengal, to have begun Indo-European studies in 1786, when he postulated the common ancestry of Sanskrit, Latin, and Greek. However, he was not the first to make this observation. In the 1500s, European visitors to the Indian subcontinent became aware of similarities between Indo-Iranian languages and European languages, and as early as 1653 Marcus Zuerius van Boxhorn had published a proposal for a proto-language (\"Scythian\") for the following language families: Germanic, Romance, Greek, Baltic, Slavic, Celtic, and Iranian. In a memoir sent to the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in 1767 Gaston-Laurent Coeurdoux, a French Jesuit who spent all his life in India, had specifically demonstrated the analogy between Sanskrit and European languages. In some ways, Jones' work was less accurate than his predecessors', as he erroneously included Egyptian, Japanese and Chinese in the Indo-European languages, while omitting Hindi.\n\nIn 1818 Rasmus Christian Rask elaborated the set of correspondences to include other Indo-European languages, such as Sanskrit and Greek, and the full range of consonants involved. In 1816 Franz Bopp published \"On the System of Conjugation in Sanskrit\" in which he investigated a common origin of Sanskrit, Persian, Greek, Latin, and German. In 1833 he began publishing the \"Comparative Grammar of Sanskrit, Zend, Greek, Latin, Lithuanian, Old Slavic, Gothic, and German\".\n\nIn 1822 Jacob Grimm formulated what became known as Grimm's law as a general rule in his \"Deutsche Grammatik\". Grimm showed correlations between the Germanic and other Indo-European languages and demonstrated that sound change systematically transforms all words of a language. From the 1870s the Neogrammarians proposed that sound laws have no exceptions, as shown in Verner's law, published in 1876, which resolved apparent exceptions to Grimm's law by exploring the role that accent (stress) had played in language change.\n\nAugust Schleicher's \"A Compendium of the Comparative Grammar of the Indo-European, Sanskrit, Greek and Latin Languages\" (1874–77) represented an early attempt to reconstruct the proto-Indo-European language.\n\nBy the early 1900s Indo-Europeanists had developed well-defined descriptions of PIE which scholars still accept today. Later, the discovery of the Anatolian and Tocharian languages added to the corpus of descendant languages. A new principle won wide acceptance in the laryngeal theory, which explained irregularities in the linguistic reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European phonology as the effects of hypothetical sounds which had disappeared from all documented languages, but which were later observed in excavated cuneiform tablets in Anatolian.\n\nJulius Pokorny's \"Indogermanisches etymologisches Wörterbuch\" (\"Indo-European Etymological Dictionary\", 1959) gave a detailed, though conservative, overview of the lexical knowledge then accumulated. Kuryłowicz's 1956 \"Apophonie\" gave a better understanding of Indo-European ablaut. From the 1960s, knowledge of Anatolian became robust enough to establish its relationship to PIE.\n\nMultiple hypotheses have been suggested about when, where, and by whom PIE was spoken. The Kurgan hypothesis, first put forward by Marija Gimbutas, is the most popular of these. It proposes that the Yamna culture of the Kurgans from the Pontic–Caspian steppe north of the Black Sea were the original speakers of PIE.\n\nAccording to the theory, PIE became widespread because its speakers, the Kurgans, were able to migrate into a vast area of Europe and Asia, thanks to technologies such as the domestication of the horse, herding, and the use of wheeled vehicles.\n\nThe people of these cultures were nomadic pastoralists, who, according to the model, by the early 3rd millennium BC had expanded throughout the Pontic–Caspian steppe and into Eastern Europe.\n\nOther theories include the Anatolian hypothesis, the Armenia hypothesis, the Paleolithic Continuity Theory, and the indigenous Aryans theory.\n\nDue to early language contact, there are some lexical similarities between the Proto-Kartvelian and Proto-Indo-European languages.\n\nAn overview map summarizes theories presented above.\n\nThe following are listed by their theoretical glottochronological development:\nCommon subgroups of Indo-European languages which are proposed include Italo-Celtic, Graeco-Aryan, Graeco-Armenian, Graeco-Phrygian, Daco-Thracian, and Thraco-Illyrian.\n\nThe Lusitanian language is a marginally attested language found in the area of modern Portugal.\n\nThe Paleo-Balkan languages, which occur in or near the Balkan peninsula, do not appear to be members of any of the subfamilies of PIE but are so poorly attested that proper classification of them is not possible. Albanian and Greek are the only surviving Indo-European languages in the group.\n\nProto-Indo-European phonology has been reconstructed in some detail. Notable features of the most widely accepted (but not uncontroversial) reconstruction include:\n\nThe Proto-Indo-European accent is reconstructed today as having had variable lexical stress, which could appear on any syllable and whose position often varied among different members of a paradigm (e.g. between singular and plural of a verbal paradigm). Stressed syllables received a higher pitch; therefore it is often said that PIE had pitch accent. The location of the stress is associated with ablaut variations, especially between normal-grade vowels (/e/ and /o/) and zero-grade (i.e. lack of a vowel), but not entirely predictable from it.\n\nThe accent is best preserved in Vedic Sanskrit and (in the case of nouns) Ancient Greek, and indirectly attested in a number of phenomena in other IE languages. To account for mismatches between the accent of Vedic Sanskrit and Ancient Greek, as well as a few other phenomena, a few historical linguists prefer to reconstruct PIE as a tone language where each morpheme had an inherent tone; the sequence of tones in a word then evolved, according to that hypothesis, into the placement of lexical stress in different ways in different IE branches.\n\nProto-Indo-European roots were affix-lacking morphemes which carried the core lexical meaning of a word and were used to derive related words (e.g., \"-\"friend\"-\" in the English words \"\"befriend\", \"friends\", and \"friend\"\" by itself). Proto-Indo-European was a fusional language, in which inflectional morphemes signalled the grammatical relationships between words. This dependence on inflectional morphemes means that roots in PIE, unlike those found in English, were rarely found by themselves. A root plus a suffix formed a word stem, and a word stem plus a desinence (usually an ending) formed a word.\n\nMany morphemes in Proto-Indo-European had short \"e\" as their inherent vowel; the Indo-European ablaut is the change of this short \"e\" to short \"o\", long \"e\" (ē), long \"o\" (\"ō\"), or no vowel. This variation in vowels occurred both within inflectional morphology (e.g., different grammatical forms of a noun or verb may have different vowels) and derivational morphology (e.g., a verb and an associated abstract verbal noun may have different vowels).\n\nCategories that PIE distinguished through ablaut were often also identifiable by contrasting endings, but the loss of these endings in some later Indo-European languages has led them to use ablaut alone to identify grammatical categories, as in the Modern English words \"sing\", \"sang\", \"sung\".\n\nProto-Indo-European nouns are declined for eight or nine cases:\nThere were three grammatical genders:\n\nProto-Indo-European pronouns are difficult to reconstruct, owing to their variety in later languages. PIE had personal pronouns in the first and second grammatical person, but not the third person, where demonstrative pronouns were used instead. The personal pronouns had their own unique forms and endings, and some had two distinct stems; this is most obvious in the first person singular where the two stems are still preserved in English \"I\" and \"me\". There were also two varieties for the accusative, genitive and dative cases, a stressed and an enclitic form.\n\nProto-Indo-European verbs, like the nouns, exhibited a system of ablaut. The most basic categorization for the Indo-European verb was grammatical aspect. Verbs were classed as:\nVerbs have at least four grammatical moods:\nVerbs had two grammatical voices:\nVerbs had three grammatical persons: (first, second and third)\n\nVerbs had three grammatical numbers:\nVerbs were also marked by a highly developed system of participles, one for each combination of tense and voice, and an assorted array of verbal nouns and adjectival formations.\n\nThe following table shows a possible reconstruction of the PIE verb endings from Sihler, which largely represents the current consensus among Indo-Europeanists.\nProto-Indo-European numerals are generally reconstructed as follows:\n\nRather than specifically 100, may originally have meant \"a large number\".\n\nProto-Indo-European particles could be used both as adverbs and postpositions, like \"under, below\". The postpositions became prepositions in most daughter languages. Other reconstructible particles include negators (), conjunctions ( \"and\", \"or\" and others) and an interjection (, an expression of woe or agony).\n\nThe syntax of the older Indo-European languages has been studied in earnest since at least the late nineteenth century, by such scholars as Hermann Hirt and Berthold Delbrück. In the second half of the twentieth century, interest in the topic increased and led to reconstructions of Proto-Indo-European syntax.\n\nSince all the early attested IE languages were inflectional, PIE is thought to have relied primarily on morphological markers, rather than word order, to signal syntactic relationships within sentences. Still, a default (unmarked) word order is thought to have existed in PIE. This was reconstructed by Jacob Wackernagel as being subject–verb–object (SVO), based on evidence in Vedic Sanskrit, and the SVO hypothesis still has some adherents, but the \"broad consensus\" among PIE scholars is that PIE would have been a subject–object–verb (SOV) language.\n\nThe SOV default word order with other orders used to express emphasis (e.g., verb–subject–object to emphasise the verb) is attested in Old Indic, Old Iranian, Old Latin and Hittite, while traces of it can be found in the enclitic personal pronouns of the Tocharian languages. A shift from OV to VO order is posited to have occurred in late PIE since many of the descendant languages have this order: modern Greek, Romance and Albanian prefer SVO, Insular Celtic has VSO as the default order, and even the Anatolian languages show some signs of this word order shift. The inconsistent order preference in Baltic, Slavic and Germanic can be attributed to contact with outside OV languages.\n\nThe Ridley Scott film \"Prometheus\" features an android named \"David\" (played by Michael Fassbender) who learns Proto-Indo-European to communicate with the \"Engineer\", an extraterrestrial whose race may have created humans. David practices PIE by reciting Schleicher's fable and goes on to attempt communication with the Engineer through PIE. Linguist Dr Anil Biltoo created the film's reconstructed dialogue and had an onscreen role teaching David Schleicher's fable.\n\n\n\n"}

The game has been mentioned in some \"Best Games Of All Time\" lists in the past.\n\n\"Rayman 2\" takes place in a world called the Glade of Dreams, and revolves around its invasion and occupation by an armada of interstellar Robo-Pirates, led by Admiral Razorbeard. Prior to the invasion, the Robo-Pirates destroyed over one hundred planets in the galaxy, with the intention of enslaving their inhabitants. Upon the invasion of the Glade of Dreams, the Robo-Pirates were battled against by Rayman, Globox, and other allies. After some battles, Rayman's capture occurs after the explosion of the Primordial Core. Ly the Fairy telepathically communicates with Rayman explaining the consequences of the damage, with the core's shattering into 1000 Yellow Lums, and the capture of many fighters. Rayman's powers are also lost due to this, and he finds himself captured by the Robo-Pirates at the beginning of the game.\n\nThe destruction of the world's core greatly weakens and disables Rayman's powers, which leads to his subsequent capture and imprisonment aboard the \"Buccaneer\", a prison ship. Globox, a friend of Rayman, is also captured and put in the same cell as Rayman aboard the \"Buccaneer\". Globox gives Rayman a Silver Lum given to him by Ly the fairy, which temporarily restores some of his powers. Rayman escapes the prison ship through a chute, however during the escape he once again separates from Globox. After falling from the ship, Rayman eventually finds himself in the Woods of Light. Rayman decides that his best chance is to find Ly, and begins his search through the forest. He comes across Murphy, a \"flying encyclopaedia\", who serves as Rayman's guide throughout the game, as well as three of Globox's children. Rayman sadly informs them of his separation with Globox, much to their dismay. The children inform Rayman that Ly has been captured by Robo-Pirates and has been taken deeper into the forest.\n\nTraversing deeper into the forest, Rayman frees a group of Teensies—small creatures with magical abilities—whom were locked in a cage. After bickering amongst themselves about who among them is their king, they inform Rayman of the Ly's location in a stronghold within the Fairy Glade. They allow Rayman access to the Hall of Doors for the cost of some Yellow Lums. Once collected, the King Teensie creates a network of portals that connect the Hall of Doors, which Rayman uses in order to access various areas throughout the Glade of Dreams. Eventually, Rayman finds Ly being held captive in a force field within the Fairy Glade. After being freed, Rayman tells Ly of his separation with Globox and his loss of powers. Due to the destruction of the Heart of the World, Ly is unable to restore Rayman's powers. However, she tells Rayman of four ancient masks, through which Polokus, the spirit of the world, must be awakened in order to defeat the Robo-Pirates. The four masks are hidden in secret sanctuaries consisting of the four elements; water/ice, earth/stone, fire, and air. Ly informs Rayman that his only hope is to find the four masks, defeat their guardians, and awaken Polokus.\n\nConcerned by Rayman's progress, Admiral Razorbeard dispatches several warships to pursue and kill him. Rayman approaches the entrance to the Sanctuary of Water and Ice, the location in which the first of the four masks is contained. He defeats its guardian, Axel, in combat and collects the first mask, which teleports him to the realm where Polokus rests eternally. Speaking to Rayman through his dreams, Polokus congratulates him on his find, and urges him to collect the three remaining masks. Rayman travels to the Menhir Hills, where he learns to tame and ride equine-like walking shells. Rayman acquaintances himself with Clark, a friendly giant, who has become terminally ill after accidentally swallowing a Robo-Pirate. He asks Rayman to retrieve the Elixir of Life from the Cave of Bad Dreams, a realm which can only be accessed if the occupant is asleep. Rayman asks a witch doctor to hypnotise him, which transports him to the Cave of Bad Dreams. Once there, Jano, the guardian of the dream world, offers Rayman the choice of eternal wealth instead of taking the elixir. If the player accepts Jano's offer, a humorous ending will play, which depicts an overweight Rayman stranded on a small island, surrounded by treasure. Declining the offer will grant Rayman the elixir, which he uses to cure Clark.\n\nAfterwards, Rayman reunites with Globox, who was captured by Robo-Pirates and brought to a remote detention facility. Globox reveals that he received another Silver Lum, which greatly enhances Rayman's offensive capabilities. After destroying a warship with his new powers, Rayman travels to Whale Bay, where he frees a benevolent whale, Carmen, who has been imprisoned by the pirates in order to use her blubber to oil the engines of their ships. Carmen informs Rayman of the second mask's location, which is situated in the Sanctuary of Stone and Fire. Its guardian, Umber, is an inanimate statue which Rayman uses to control in order to walk across lava and obtain the second mask. Once obtained and given to Polokus, Razorbeard becomes infuriated with Rayman's success and orders numerous fleets of warships to kill him. A group of warships ambush Rayman in a mountainous precipice and almost kill him, however he ultimately escapes.\n\nRayman collects the third mask at the Sanctuary of Rock and Lava, and obtains a new power from Ly which gives him the ability to fly. However the guardian of the sanctuary, Foutch, wounds Rayman which causes him to lose his ability of flight. After giving the third mask to Polokus, he teleports Rayman to the Iron Mountains, which houses a vast network of mines. Rayman encounters Uglette, wife of Globox, who is in despair after informing Rayman that dozens of her children are being used for labour in the mines, and Globox has once again been captured and sent to the \"Buccaneer\". Rayman hijacks a warship and rescues all of Globox's children from the mines. As Uglette and the children leave, one of the children passes Rayman the fourth mask, claiming that they found it in the mines. Rayman departs to see Polokus, who congratulates him on his work, and uses the power of all four masks to awaken himself. Polokus tells Rayman that he can destroy all Robo-Pirates in the Glade of Dreams, but he has no power in the air. Polokus then creates a portal which leads Rayman to the airborne \"Buccaneer\", in which he must defeat Admiral Razorbeard and save Globox.\n\nOn board the \"Buccaneer\", a general visits Razorbeard, who presents to him the Grolgoth, a large powered exoskeleton which makes the user invulnerable to damage. Razorbeard purchases it, and plans for his final confrontation with Rayman. Soon after, Rayman infiltrates the \"Buccaneer\" and finds both Razorbeard (housed inside the Grolgoth) and Globox in the crow's nest of the ship. During combat, Razorbeard accidentally collapses the floor, plunging both him and Rayman into a lava-filled furnace. During the descent, Ly telepathically saves Rayman from his fall and creates him a sentient flying shell, which he uses to knock the Grolgoth into the lava. Razorbeard escapes the ship in a small shuttlecraft, and initiates the self-destruct, which destroys the \"Buccaneer\" with Rayman still inside. Later, at Rayman's funeral, all gather for a memorial service. They could only recover Rayman's left shoe, however, the shoe suddenly appears to react to an oncoming presence, as a limping, one-footed Rayman emerges nearby, much to the joy of everyone present.\n\nThe game is played from a third-person perspective and the player has control over the camera, though in some situations this control is limited to only certain angles. At several points in the game the player loses control during cut scenes, which typically show dialogue between characters.\n\nBy collecting lums, the player unlocks more information about the game world and its back story, which can be read by standing still and pressing a specific button for some time. Some back story is also obtained through (optional) instructions from Murfy, a \"flying encyclopaedia\" who provides explanations on all kinds of gameplay elements.\n\nIn contrast to its predecessor, which was a 2D platformer, \"Rayman 2\" is a 3D platformer. The player navigates through a mostly linear sequence of levels, fighting enemy Robo-Pirates, solving puzzles and collecting \"lums\". Collecting enough lums gains the player access to new parts of the world. Part of the lums are hidden in small cages, in which other freedom fighters or Teensies are imprisoned, and can be obtained by breaking the cages.\n\nRayman starts the game with minimal abilities, and he can gain more abilities as the game progresses. The main weapon available in the game is Rayman's fist, with which energy orbs can be shot. Eventually, the orbs can be charged before shooting them, making them more powerful. Rayman can also enter a strafing stance which allows him to easily aim orbs whilst avoiding enemy attacks. Rayman later gains the ability to swing over large gaps using Purple Lums. Rayman is also able to use his helicopter hair to slow his descent while jumping, with some segments later in the game allowing him to fly with his hair. There are also various items Rayman can use throughout the game, such as explosive barrels he can throw, giant plums he can ride on to carry him across dangerous surfaces, and rockets he must ride on to access new areas.\nIn addition to the main, story-based level sequence, there are also several levels in which the player can gain bonuses in a time trial. Additionally, by collecting all lums and breaking all cages in a level, the player unlocks a bonus level in which one of Globox's children races against a robot pirate. When the player controlling the child wins the race, Rayman gains health or a powerup.\n\n\"Rayman 2\" was released on a wide variety of platforms, with several differences and name changes between the versions.\n\nThe Nintendo 64 version of \"Rayman 2: The Great Escape\" was released first, followed by a Microsoft Windows release later that year, with slight improvements to the Microsoft Windows version (including graphics and music).\n\nOn 26 May 2011, GOG.com re-released \"Rayman 2: The Great Escape\", alongside \"\" and \"Rayman Forever\", made to be compatible with Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7, along with a digital version of the game's soundtrack as bonus content. On 26 January 2012 Ubisoft announced that \"Rayman 2\" would be added as a bonus for preordering the Microsoft Windows version of \"Rayman Origins\".\n\nThe Dreamcast version has various changes from the original Nintendo 64 and Microsoft Windows versions, including several 2D sprites being replaced by 3D models, and a slightly zoomed-out camera angle. The Dreamcast version also has exclusive mini-games, playable by finding hidden crystals, and changes to the world map (the Dreamcast version uses The Isle of Doors instead of The Hall of Doors as the world map) and final battle. Many features in the Dreamcast version are retained in Rayman Revolution, such as the camera angle and the 3D models. This version has received the highest average reviews, winning 'IGN Dreamcast Game of the Year 2000', and a 9.6 score from IGN.\n\nThe PlayStation version was developed by Ubi Soft Shanghai, and is the first version to have the characters speaking real languages (English, French, German, Spanish and Italian), replacing the gibberish spoken by the characters originally. Numerous level design changes were made, and some levels and cutscenes (namely the fake ending seen if the player accepts Jano's offer) were removed altogether. There are only 800 Yellow Lums in this version, nor is it decreased to 799 at any point as the scene with Razorbeard eating one of the Yellow Lums was changed so that he would eat a Red one instead, and as they're health pickups no matter which version of Rayman 2 you play, they have no total. Characters like the Ninjaws mini-boss that first appears at the end of The Sanctuary of Stone and Fire are exclusive to this version, and characters that did not have speaking roles before, such as the guardians Axel, Umber, and Foutch, now speak to Rayman when he confronts them.\n\nThis port was later released on the PlayStation Network on 18 December 2008 in North America and on 28 July 2010 in Europe.\n\nThis version, titled \"Rayman: Revolution\" (\"Rayman 2: Revolution\" in North America), was released on 22 December 2000. It features many enhancements including new minigames and bonus challenges, upgrades to Rayman's abilities, level revisions, new music tracks, the option to switch between the gibberish from other versions and newly recorded real language voices, three new bosses, and Yellow Lum redistribution. The Hall of Doors was replaced with three central hubs, called The Minisaurus Plain, Globox's House and The Rainbow Creek, in which to walk to each level freely, play Ly's bonus challenges unlocked by freeing Revolution-exclusive prisoners called Familiar Spirits, and purchase ability upgrades or the new minigames from the Teensies with the Yellow Lums the player has collected.\n\nTo date, Revolution is the only edition of \"Rayman 2\" that lets players save when a level has been only partially completed, but like all versions of the game, it still uses manual saves. This is also the only version in which the 1,000th Yellow Lum can be obtained normally, and hence actually changes the total back to 1,000 despite Razorbeard still eating it and the total changing to 999/999. The 1,000th Lum is obtained after beating Clark and receiving the Lumz Radar, a magnet-shaped gadget exclusive to Revolution that helps players track down any missed Yellow Lums.\n\nHowever, despite the numerous improvements and enhancements to the gameplay, the frame rate is not as smooth as the near-constant 60fps of the Sega Dreamcast version,\nand certain graphical effects from that version, such as the blue ring trails that accompany a fully charged gold fist orb, are also gone.\n\nThis port was later released on the PlayStation Network on 1 May 2012 in North America.\n\nTitled \"Rayman 2 Forever\" (\"Rayman 2\" in North America), this version was developed by Ubi Soft Milan. It is a 2D side scroller, and follows the story of the other versions. It was released in June 2001 in North America and December 2001 in Europe.\nIt has two identical boss fights. The second boss is Razorbeard, even though the sprite for a common Robo Pirate is used. Ly and Globox appear only in cutscenes. Like the PS1 version, Rayman has to collect 800 Lums instead of 1000.\n\nThe Nintendo 64 version of the game was ported to the Nintendo DS by DC Studios under the title \"Rayman DS\" on 24 March 2005. Very few changes have been made to the game from the Nintendo 64 version. Parts of some music tracks have been taken out and some graphical textures have been simplified, both likely due to storage limits on the Nintendo DS cartridge. The port also added touch screen controls.\n\nUsing the engine of \"Rayman 2\" for the Dreamcast, another port was released for Apple's iOS-based portable devices on 1 March 2010. It features landscape touch-screen controls, with a figurative analogue stick on the left and two on-screen \"buttons\" on the right-hand side of the screen. The iOS game has since been removed from the App Store.\n\nAt a Nintendo event held in Europe on 19 January 2011, Ubisoft revealed several titles in development for Nintendo 3DS, which included a port of \"Rayman 2\" titled \"Rayman 3D\" to be released at the system's launch. Ubisoft confirmed that this version is a port of the Dreamcast version (and like the iOS version, the 3DS one also has no minigames nor the Globox Village) with \"major updates on key gameplay elements such as accessibility, progression and learning curve.\" With this release, versions of \"Rayman 2\" have been launch titles for two Nintendo handheld consoles.\n\n\"Rayman 2\" was originally conceptualised as a sidescrolling 2D platformer, like the first game. Development on the prototype began in early 1996 and was slated to be released on the PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and Microsoft Windows in the fourth quarter of that year. The prototype of \"Rayman 2\" featured some usage of 3D models on a 2D background, differing from the 16-bit presentation of its predecessor. The prototype is playable in the final PlayStation version of the game if the player completes a certain percentage of the game.\n\n\"Rayman 2\" computer version received a \"Silver\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom.\n\n\"Rayman 2\" received acclaim from both critics and fans, scoring a 9 on Nintendo 64, 9.2 on Microsoft Windows and PlayStation and 9.6 on Dreamcast from IGN. It also received 'IGN Dreamcast Game of the Year 2000'. It was praised in most aspects including gameplay, audio, graphics and controls, praising the colourful, vibrant worlds, the soundtrack, and the varied gameplay. IGN's Brandon Justice called it \"the most impressive feat of game design and execution the platforming genre has ever seen.\"\n\nThe reception for \"Rayman DS\" was mixed, citing graphical flaws and camera problems, While it did support controlling the game via the touchpad, this was regarded as sloppy and awkward, partly caused by the game being a direct port of the Nintendo 64 version. \"Rayman 3D\" got a similarly mixed reception due to it being a direct port of the Dreamcast release, with no true usage of the 3DS's capabilities except for stereoscopic 3D.\n"}

The phenomenon has been attributed to advertising-supported media. Examples include the Superman series. Positive examples of recombinant culture have included sampling in music. \n"}

{"id": "2653043", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2653043", "title": "Reverse chronology", "text": "Reverse chronology\n\nReverse chronology is a method of story-telling whereby the plot is revealed in reverse order.\n\nIn a story employing this technique, the first scene shown is actually the conclusion to the plot. Once that scene ends, the penultimate scene is shown, and so on, so that the final scene the viewer sees is the first chronologically.\n\nMany stories employ flashback, showing prior events, but whereas the scene order of most conventional films is A-B-C-etc., a film in reverse chronology goes Z-Y-X-etc.\n\nAs a hypothetical example, if the fairy tale \"Jack and the Beanstalk\" was told using reverse chronology, the opening scene would depict Jack chopping the beanstalk down and killing the giant. The next scene would feature Jack being discovered by the giant and climbing down the beanstalk in fear of his life. Later, we would see Jack running into the man with the infamous magic beans, then, at the end of the film, being sent off by his mother to sell the cow.\n\nThe unusual nature of this method means it is only used in stories of a specific nature. For example, \"Memento\" features a man with anterograde amnesia, meaning he is unable to form new memories. The film parallels the protagonist's perspective by unfolding in reverse chronological order, leaving the audience as ignorant of the events that occurred prior to each scene (which, played in reverse chronological order, will not be revealed until later) as the protagonist is.\n\nIn the film \"Irréversible,\" an act of homicidal violence takes place at the start of the movie (i. e., it is the final event to take place). During the remainder of the film we learn not only that the violence is an act of vengeance, but what exactly is being avenged. The film was highly controversial for its graphic nature; had the scenes been shown in chronological order, this violent content would make it a simple, and pointlessly brutal, revenge movie. However, as it is, told in reverse, the audience is made to consider the exact consequences of each action, and there is often \"more than meets the eye.\"\n\nThe epic poem \"Aeneid\", written by Virgil in the 1st century BC, uses reverse chronology within scenes. In \"The Three Apples\", a murder mystery in the \"One Thousand and One Nights\", the middle part of the story shows a flashback of events leading up to the discovery of a dead body at the beginning of the story. The action of W. R. Burnett's novel, \"Goodbye to the Past\" (1934), moves continually from 1929 to 1873. \"The Long View\" (1956) by Elizabeth Jane Howard describes a marriage in reverse chronology from 1950s London back to its beginning in 1926. Edward Lewis Wallant uses flashbacks in reverse chronology in \"The Human Season\" (1960). The novel \"Christopher Homm\" (1965), by C. H. Sisson, is also told in reverse chronology.\n\nPhilip K. Dick, in his 1967 novel \"Counter-Clock World\", describes a future in which time has started to move in reverse, resulting in the dead reviving in their own graves (\"old-birth\"), living their lives in reverse, eventually ending in returning to the womb, and splitting into an egg and a sperm during copulation between a recipient woman and a man. The novel was expanded from Dick's short story \"Your Appointment Will Be Yesterday\", first published in the August 1966 edition of Amazing Stories.\n\nMartin Amis's 1991 novel \"Time's Arrow\" tells the story of a man who, it seems, brings dead people to life. Eventually it is revealed that the story is being seen backwards, and he was a doctor at Auschwitz who brought death to live people. He escaped to the United States, and the novel starts with his death and ends with his birth. Amis writes in the Afterword that he had a \"certain paragraph\" from Kurt Vonnegut's \"Slaughterhouse Five\" (1969) in mind. As he waits to be taken by aliens to the planet Tralfamadore, the protagonist, Billy Pilgrim, watches a war movie backwards. American planes full of holes fly backwards as German planes suck bullets from them; bombers take their bombs back to base where they are returned to the States, reduced to ore and buried. The American fliers became high school kids again, and, Billy guesses, Hitler ultimately returns to babyhood.\n\nIain Banks's novel \"Use of Weapons\" interweaves two parallel stories, one told in standard chronology and one in reverse, both concluding at a critical moment in the main character's life.\n\nJulia Alvarez's novel \"How the García Girls Lost Their Accents\" opens in 1989 with one of the characters returning to her native Dominican Republic. The story of why the family left and their attempts to succeed in New York are told in reverse chronological order, with the last events happening in 1956.\n\nA number of plays have employed this technique. George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart's 1934 play, \"Merrily We Roll Along\", is told in reverse order, as is the Harold Pinter play \"Betrayal\" (1978). Kaufman and Hart's play was adapted as a musical comedy by Stephen Sondheim in 1981, and Pinter's play was made into a film in 1983.\n\nIn 1927, Jean Epstein's \"La glace à trois faces\" (\"The Three Sided Mirror\") features a sequence where the events happen in reverse, beginning with the protagonist's exit from a room until the viewer sees the entrance. The Czech comedy \"Happy End\" (1966) is a farce which starts with a guillotined man finding his head popped back on his shoulders and ends with him as a new-born being pushed back into his mother's womb. Atom Egoyan, influenced by Pinter's plays, tells the story of \"The Sweet Hereafter\" (1997) in reverse chronology, with the first scene of the film set in 1977 and the last in 1968. The technique was later employed in \"Peppermint Candy\" (2000), by South Korean director Lee Chang-dong; in \"Memento\" (2000), a mystery directed by Christopher Nolan about short term memory loss; and in Jean-Luc Godard's short film \"De l'origine du XXIe siècle pour moi\" (2000). In \"Irréversible\" (2002), the technique is used so thoroughly that the end credits are not only shown at the beginning of the movie, but they roll \"down\" the screen, rather than upwards as is familiar.\n\nThe first several scenes in 2003's film \"Identity\", starring John Cusack, occur in reverse order.\n\nThe 2004 film \"5x2\", directed by François Ozon, tells the story of a relationship between two people in five episodes using reverse chronology.\n\nIn \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" (2004), a main substory is told in reverse.\n\n\"Coup de Sang\", a French film by Jean Marboeuf (2006), uses limited reverse chronology. The film begins with the revelation that the main character will commit a murder one week from the next scene, although it is not revealed who will be killed or why.\n\nIn the 2007 movie \"P.S. I Love You\", the scenes in which Gerry Kennedy (Gerard Butler) meets and courts Holly (Hilary Swank) are shown in reverse.\n\nIn the 2010 Tamil movie, \"Manmadan Ambu\", the song \"Neela Vaanam\" (visuals inspired by Coldplay's \"The Scientist\") is shown in a reverse sequence.\n\nThe made-for-television drama \"\"Two Friends\"\" (1986), by Jane Campion, and the 1997 episode, \"The Betrayal\", of the hit sitcom \"Seinfeld\", employs the technique. The \"Seinfeld\" episode is a take-off of the Harold Pinter play \"Betrayal\" and has a character named \"Pinter.\" \"Redrum\", a 2000 episode of \"The X-Files,\" uses the technique in focusing on a character experiencing the events in reverse along with the audience. The 2002 \"ER\" episode \"Hindsight\" uses reverse chronology to illustrate the events leading to traumatic car accident. A 1997 episode, \"\", which writer Kenneth Biller claimed was based on a Martin Amis novel \"Time's Arrow\", also features a character experiencing the events in reverse along with the audience. The \"Sealab 2021\" episode \"Shrabster\" is also in reverse order. For a few seasons, the revived \"Doctor Who\" had an extensive storyline focusing on a relationship between the Doctor and his companions' daughter (River Song) from the future based on \"opposite timelines\" (i.e., as the Doctor was travelling through time on one path, River was travelling on an opposite path) causing them to interact in opposite chronological order. In 2017, the British tv mini-series \"Rellik\" (Killer backwards) tells a story about a serial killer in backwards order. In 2018, the episode \"Once Removed\", from the series \"Inside No. 9\" uses reverse chronology to tell a dark story about a family who is moving house, and the murder that subsequently begins. Also from 2018, the second installment of the FX anthology series \"American Crime Story\" focuses on , employing reverse chronology through the course of several episodes to explore the background of Versace's killer Andrew Cunanan.\n\nThe story \"The Time Eater\" from issue 40 of the comic \"Vampirella\", scripted by Jack Butterworth and published in 1975, included the concept of human lives running backwards. People were shown to be exhumed, reunited with families, separated from their spouses in order to attend school, and finally returned to the womb. Dialogue was reversed also. Alan Moore's 1983 short story \"The Reversible Man\" from issue 308 of the comic \"2000AD\" told an ordinary man's life backwards, using the same concept as Butterworth but recasting it as a first-person narrative. Brian K. Vaughan wrote an issue of the ongoing Midnighter series told in reverse chronology. The issue explored the fact that the character Midnighter has the ability to calculate millions of possible scenarios for any given situation. The issue does not have the scenes in reverse order, but rather the individual pages run backwards.\n\nIssue 43 of Bongo's \"Simpsons Comics\" is told in reverse order: the story opens with a depiction of a crane lifting a crashed car out of a lake; each subsequent scene (which lasts for one page) carries a caption informing the reader that it took place, for instance, \"20 minutes earlier\". The penultimate page jumps back thirty years and shows Homer Simpson as a child\n\nThe 2007 anime television series \"Touka Gettan\" employed entirely this narrative method. All 26 episodes were aired in chronologically reverse order, with the first episode being the ending of the story while the last episode being the beginning.\n\nThe lyrics to \"All Along the Watchtower\", written by Bob Dylan, are, he says, \"in a rather reverse order\"; indeed, the final verse begins with the words \"All along the watchtower\", and if reversed, the verses would tell the story in the correct order.\n\nThe lyrics to \"Apparition. Apparitions.\" by Trophy Scars describe the events leading up to a woman's suicide in reverse order, beginning with her death and ending with her initial romance with her boyfriend.\n\nThe song \"One Thing Leads to Another\" by the Pet Shop Boys (on a limited release of their 1993 album \"Very\") describes the events leading up to a man's death in reverse order.\n\nMultiple music videos, including Coldplay's \"The Scientist\" use reverse chronology in which a scene plays backwards while someone sings normally. This is done by filming the video chronologically but getting the actor to sing the lyrics backwards. The music video for Enigma's \"Return to Innocence\" uses reverse chronology showing a man's life, beginning with his death as an old man and ending with his baptism as an infant. The music video for Linkin Park's \"Bleed It Out\" also uses the same method, whereas the band performs normally, but everything else is reversed. In 2016, Malaysian Singer-Songwriter Yuna uses reverse chronology in her music video \"Lanes\".\n\nThe events of the song \"Reverse\" by SomeKindaWonderful, as said in the title itself, are told in reverse chronology.\n\nThe lyrics in \"Rewind\" by NaS also tell a story in reverse chronology, with some of the dialogue even being in reverse order.\n\n\"Good Mistake\" Album by Bahram Nouraei is the first Iranian concept album ever made inspired by reverse chronology as the storytelling method.\n\nThere have also been several discussions as to how the picturisation of Neela Vaanam \"Manmadan Ambu\" (sung by Kamal Haasan himself) has been slightly inspired from official video of Coldplay's The Scientist. The whole song has been depicted in such a way so as to highlight the events that led to the death of Mannar's (Kamal's character) French wife Juliet, in reverse.\n\nThe announcement trailer of 2011 video game, \"Dead Island\", also present in reverse chronological order with flash of chronological action edited into the whole video.\n\n"}

In the past, the trip was often a big-game hunt, but today, safaris are often to observe and photograph wildlife—or hiking and sightseeing, as well.\n\nThe Swahili word \"safari\" means \"journey,\" originally from the Arabic سفر (safar) meaning \"a journey\"; the verb for \"to travel\" in Swahili is \"kusafiri\". These words are used for any type of journey, e.g. by bus from Nairobi to Mombasa or by ferry from Dar es Salaam to Unguja. \"Safari\" entered the English language at the end of the 1850s thanks to explorer Richard Francis Burton.\n\nThe Regimental March of the King's African Rifles was 'Funga Safari', literally 'set out on a journey', or, in other words, pack up equipment ready for travel. \n\nWhich is, in English:\n\nOn Kenya's independence from Britain, Funga Safari was retained as the Regimental March of the Kenya Rifles, successor to the K.A.R.\n\nIn 1836 William Cornwallis Harris led an expedition purely to observe and record wildlife and landscapes by the expedition's members. Harris established the safari style of journey, starting with a not too strenuous rising at first light, an energetic day walking, an afternoon rest then concluding with a formal dinner and telling stories in the evening over drinks and tobacco. The hunting aspect traditionally associated with the safari is said to have its origins in the early 1800s in the region of Évora, Alentejo, where villagers got together to hunt wild boar and reclaim land for farming. \n\nJules Verne's first novel \"Five Weeks in a Balloon\" published in 1863 and H. Rider Haggard's first novel \"King Solomon's Mines\" published in 1885, both describe journeys of English travellers on Safari and were best sellers in their day. These two books gave rise to a genre of Safari adventure novels and films.\n\nErnest Hemingway wrote several fiction and non-fiction pieces about African safaris. His short stories \"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber\" and \"The Snows of Kilimanjaro\" are set on African safaris and were written after Hemingway's own experience on safari. His books \"Green Hills of Africa\" and \"True at First Light\" are both set on African safaris.\n\nThe safari provided countless hours of cinema entertainment in sound films from \"Trader Horn\" (1931) onwards. The safari was used in many adventure films such as the Tarzan, Jungle Jim, and Bomba the Jungle Boy film series up to \"The Naked Prey\" (1965) where Cornel Wilde, a white hunter, becomes game himself. The safari genre films were parodied in the Bob Hope comedies \"Road to Zanzibar\" and \"Call Me Bwana\". A short 15-minute helicopter safari was shown in \"Africa Addio\" where clients are armed, flown from their hotel and landed in front of an unlucky and baffled elephant. \"Out of Africa\" has Karen Blixen and famous hunter Denys Finch Hatton travelling, with Denys refusing to abandon home comforts using fine china and crystal and listening to Mozart recordings over the gramophone while on safari trip.\n\nThere is a certain theme or style associated with the word, which includes khaki clothing, belted bush jackets, pith helmets or slouch hats, and animal skin patterns. The term \"safari chic\" arose after the release of the film \"Out of Africa\". This not only included clothing but also interior design and architecture.\n\n"}

It is used as a method to bring organization to a work area. This name for a portable cabinet is common to artists. However, in the context of the Arts and Crafts Movement, a taboret is a stand for a plant or a beverage.\n\nAs a stool, it refers to a short stool without a back or arms. The name is derived from its resemblance to a drum (diminutive of Old French \"tabour\").\n\nThe tabouret acquired a more specialized meaning in 17th century France at the court of Louis XIV in Versailles. Sitting in the presence of the royal family was a much coveted honor, and the tabouret was the way to do it. The court tabouret was an elaborate, upholstered stool with curved wooden legs and tassels, carried by a liveried and wigged servant. Duchesses were automatically granted the honor of sitting in front of the queen. In fact, this stool became such a symbol of privilege that when Louis XIV's mother, the Regent Anne of Austria, granted the tabouret to two non-duchesses, such a storm of protest was raised that she had to revoke the order.\n\n"}

It was adopted as the Georgian national anthem in May 2004, along with the new national flag and coat of arms. The symbols' change was brought about upon the successful overthrow of the previous government in the bloodless Rose Revolution. The music, taken from the Georgian operas \"Abesalom da Eteri\" (\"Abesalom and Eteri\") and \"Daisi\" (\"The Nightfall\"), by the Georgian composer Zacharia Paliashvili (), was adapted to form it by Ioseb Kechakmadze (). The lyrics were composed by David Magradze ().\n\nThe current Georgian national anthem was adopted by the Parliament of Georgia on 20 May 2004, exactly 5 months after the resignation of President Eduard Shevardnadze in the Rose Revolution. A bill was introduced in the first plenary meeting of the 6th convocation of the Georgian Parliament on April 22, 2004. The bill to adopt \"Tavisupleba\" as Georgia's national anthem was presented by the Minister of Culture Giorgi Gabashvili; in which the music was played for the deputies soon afterwards. The law does not give any regulations, but refers to the corresponding Presidential Decree.\n\n\"Tavisupleba\" succeeded the old national anthem \"Dideba zetsit kurtheuls\", which was in use by the Democratic Republic of Georgia from 1918 to 1921, and again by the newly independent (from the Soviet Union) Georgia from 1990 to 2004.\n\nThe new national anthem quickly gained popularity in contrast to its predecessor, whose lyrics were somewhat archaic and difficult to memorize.\n\nDuring U.S. President George W. Bush's visit to Georgia, on May 10, 2005, when he along with President Mikheil Saakashvili was addressing tens of thousands of Georgians in Freedom Square in Tbilisi, a recording of \"Tavisupleba\" failed to play properly. Saakashvili then motioned to the choirs, and thousands in the crowd joined the singers in singing it, a moment which was described by media as \"the most powerful moment of the day\".\n\nThe music of \"Tavisupleba\" was adapted from two Georgian operas, \"Abesalom da Eteri\" (1918) and \"Daisi\" (1923), composed by Zacharia Paliashvili, the father of the Georgian classical music genre.\n\nA version of the song is sung in Abkhazian, as it is an official language of the Abkhazian AR.\n\nAccording to the Regulations for the Parliament of Georgia, Chapter 3, Article 4.5., the national anthem of Georgia is played at the opening and closing of each session. It is also performed following the signing of the Oath of the Parliamentarian after the Parliament recognizes the authority of at least two-third of its newly elected members (Chapter 25, Article 124.7). The anthem is also played prior to the annual report of the President of Georgia to the Parliament.\n\nGeorgian Public Broadcaster airs a music video version of the anthem, featuring opera singer Paata Burchuladze.\n\n"}

It engages Indigenous Australians and non-Indigenous Australians with the aim of building partnerships and celebrating youth and traditional culture. Over three fun days, primary and high school students participate in activities related to arts, education, health, careers, sports, health and reconciliation. In the evenings students stage non-competitive school dance performances under the stars.\n\nCroc Festival was created in 1998 after the former Queensland Minister for Health, Mike Horan, asked the producers of the Rock Eisteddfod Challenge to find a way to get more indigenous students to attend school. \n\nThe inaugural Croc Festival in Weipa (far-north Queensland) in July 1998 attracted 350 students from 17 schools in Cape York and Torres Strait. It was opened by the then Governor-General, Sir William Deane, who observed that the event was \"reconciliation in action\". In 2007 Croc Festival is expected to attract almost 20,000 students from 450 schools with a national audience of about 60,000 people.\n\nCroc Festival is 100% drug, alcohol and tobacco free. According to research and reports by teachers, outcomes for students include improved self-esteem and teamwork, improved tolerance of other students, awareness of personal health issues such as nutrition and mental health, and knowledge of the dangers of drugs, alcohol and tobacco. Further outcomes include increased rates of school attendance, improved literacy, numeracy and oratorical skills, and better goal setting for the future.\n\nCroc Festival in 2007 will be held on Thursday Island in Queensland, Derby and Mullewa in Western Australia, Alice Springs in the Northern Territory, Port Augusta in South Australia, Kempsey and Dubbo in New South Wales, and Shepparton in Victoria. Students travel by road, air and sea to reach the venues, often camping in tents at Croc Village during the three-day festival.\n\nThe not-for-profit Croc Festival is supported by community businesses, local, state and federal government funding, corporate and philanthropic sponsorship, and in-kind support. Croc Festival and the Rock Eisteddfod Challenge are part of the Global Rock Challenge family which engages youth in seven countries around the world.\n\nThe Croc Festival was cancelled in 2008 due to a Federal funding cut.\n\n"}

Taking place during the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR, the Time of Troubles was a cataclysmic period during which the gods of Faerûn were forced to walk the earth in their mortal avatar forms. However, unlike when a god usually sends an avatar and its true form resides usually on one of the Outer Planes, the gods were all demoted and this was the only form they had at the time, making them very vulnerable. Several major deities died during the Time of Troubles, and a handful of mortals rose to divinity.\n\nFor books and associated Dungeons and Dragons roleplaying modules see The Avatar Series which lists Shadowdale (module), Tantras (module), and Waterdeep (module).\n\nOn the fictional world of Toril, the planet on which the Dungeons and Dragons fantasy setting The Forgotten Realms is based, The Time of Troubles was precipitated by an attempt by two of the settings' deities, the gods Bane and Myrkul, to steal the Tablets of Fate from the overgod Ao. The tablets were created by Ao and delineated the areas of responsibilities given to each deity: his or her \"portfolio\" over which each of the gods of the Forgotten Realms have domain. Angry with the gods for their habitual pursuit of power and negligence toward their mortal faithful, the theft of the Tablets resulted in Ao banishing all of the gods save Helm (selected to protect the gates to the heavens) to take on avatars and live as mortals on Toril. The novels covering this event and subsequent game products take place almost exclusively on the western continent of Faerûn. \n\nThe immediate effects of this banishment were threefold. First, divine magic (spells granted to clerics by their patron deities) ceased to function altogether unless the cleric was within one mile of their deity's avatar. Second, arcane magic (a force channeled from The Weave by wizards and sorcerers) ceased to be regulated by its steward, Mystra, and became dangerously unpredictable. Third, the characteristically immortal and aloof deities were now vulnerable (though devastatingly powerful) and dwelling among the civilizations of Faerûn.\n\nThe Time of Troubles coincided with the release of the second edition of the \"Advanced Dungeons and Dragons\" game, and events in the story reflected changes in the game rules. For example, the demise of the assassin cults in Faerûn reflected the fact that the assassin player character class was discontinued in \"AD&D Second Edition\". Similarly, in the comic-book series based on Forgotten Realms, a wizard notes that after the upheavals in magic caused by the Troubles, some of his spells had changed in power and effect; and indeed, the game rules for those same spells had been revised.\n\nThe Time of Troubles was a time of significant turnover among the gods of the Faerûnian Pantheon. Several deities were \"destroyed\" during this period. The following are deities who were killed or incapacitated during the Time of Troubles:\n\n\nHowever, many of these deities have in some way circumvented their own destruction:\n\n\nFurthermore, a selection of mortals were chosen by Lord Ao to ascend to the heavens to fill the void left by those deities who died:\n\n\nFinally, Lord Ao lifted the barrier that prevented the Mulhorandi god-kings from reuniting with their divine selves on the Outer Planes. The physical incarnations of the Mulhorandi gods departed Faerun and left governance of the empire to mortal rulers under their guidance.\n"}

This look, consisting of colorful costumes, was fashionable and mainstream from the 1920s to the 1960s. Women who dressed in the Tricana poveira style became known as tricana girls.\n\nDuring tricana's heyday, a tricana girl would typically wear a shawl, an apron, a skirt, a handkerchief and glossy high-heeled slippers.\n\nThey were thought of as Povoan beauty icons. The author José de Azevedo, referring to their peculiar way of walking and dressing, called tricanas common people with the mannerisms of royalty.\n\nEven though the fashion was based on traditional fishers' clothing, the Tricanas were generally from a blue collar background, often daughters of shoemakers, carpenters or similar craftsmen, while many worked as tailors themselves. They applied their knowledge derived from their background in fashion-related industries to their own dressing style. Bairro da Matriz quarter was famed for its charming and attractive tricanas.\n\nMeanwhile, women actually working in the fishing industry would wear their traditional costumes. Though dressed similarly to the tricana girls, they were visibly poorer and wore longer skirts made of lower-quality materials and in darker colors.\n\nHair texturing techniques are also relevant to the style and follows traditional Povoan techniques, most notably the pulling of the hair called \"puxo\".\n\nDuring parades, tricanas from the six traditional quarters wear dresses in their neighborhood colors.\n\nThe tricana style's heyday was between the 1920s and the 1960s, when it had a strong impact both within Póvoa de Varzim and on outsiders visiting the city.\n\nTricana costumes were mainstream fashion amongst middle class teenagers until the appearance of ready-to-wear clothing in the 1970s. As younger people adopted more modern international fashions, tricana poveira now only appears in urban folklore groups and parades.\n\nNowadays, tricana costumes can be quite expensive depending on the preferences of the tricana girl and the materials used. Still kept as a strong tradition, tricana girls during \"Rusgas de São Pedro\" (Saint Peter Parades), play a big part in the city's festivities on June 28 and 29.\n\n\"Tricanas do Cidral\" (from Bairro da Matriz quarter), the first folklore group based on the tricana style, appeared as early as 1920. \"Tricanas da Lapa\" (from Bairro Sul quarter) banded together in 1952, \"Rancho Estrela do Norte\" in 1954 and the regional \"Tricanas Poveiras\" in 1993. Leões da Lapa F.C., the city's south quarter association, has a Miss Tricana contest.\n\n"}
