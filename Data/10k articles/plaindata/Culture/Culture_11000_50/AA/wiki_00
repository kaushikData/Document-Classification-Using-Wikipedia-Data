David Elkind's theory on adolescent egocentrism is drawn from Piaget's theory on cognitive developmental stages, which argues that formal operations enable adolescents to construct imaginary situations and abstract thinking. \n\nAccordingly, adolescents are able to conceptualize their own thoughts and conceive of other people's thoughts. However, Elkind pointed out that adolescents tend to focus mostly on their own perceptions – especially on their behaviors and appearance – because of the \"physiological metamorphosis\" they experience during this period. This leads to adolescents' belief that other people are as attentive to their behaviors and appearance as they are of themselves. According to Elkind, adolescent egocentrism results in two consequential mental constructions, namely imaginary audience and personal fable.\n\nImaginary audience is a term that Elkind used to describe the phenomenon that an adolescent anticipates the reactions of other people to him/herself in actual or impending social situations. Elkind argued that this kind of anticipation could be explained by the adolescent's preoccupation that others are as admiring or as critical of him as he is of himself. As a result, an audience is created, as the adolescent believes that he/she will be the focus of attention.\n\nHowever, more often than not the audience is imaginary because in actual social situations always being the focus of public attention is not usually the case. Elkind believed that the construction of imaginary audiences would partially account for a wide variety of typical adolescent behaviors and experiences; and imaginary audiences played a role in the self-consciousness that emerges in early adolescence. However, since the audience is usually the adolescent's own construction, it is privy to his or her own knowledge of him/herself.\n\nAccording to Elkind, the notion of imaginary audience helps to explain why adolescents usually seek privacy and feel reluctant to reveal themselves – it is a reaction to the feeling that one is constantly under the critical scrutiny of others.\n\nElkind addressed that adolescents have a complex set of beliefs that their own feelings are unique and they are special and immortal. Personal fable is the term Elkind created to describe this notion, which is the complement of the construction of imaginary audience. Since an adolescent usually fails to differentiate his focus on his own perceptions and that of others, he tends to believe that he is of importance to so many people (the imaginary audiences) that he comes to regard his feelings as something special and unique. This belief in personal uniqueness and invincibility becomes an illusion that he can be above some of the rules, disciplines and laws that apply to other people; even consequences such as death . Due to the existence of personal fable at some point, an adolescent tends to substitute the roles of an idol, a hero or even a god with his own image.\n\nElkind believed that adolescent egocentrism was a temporary phenomenon that will gradually diminish as adolescents grow older. The reason of this, Elkind argued, was because after entering the formal operational stage, no new mental systems would develop. Therefore, the mental structures formed during adolescence would continue to function for the rest of the life span. Accordingly, the two mental constructions that result from egocentrism, imaginary audience and personal fable, will gradually be overcome and disappear as formal operations become mature and stable.\n\nThe imaginary audience, Elkind said, could be regarded as \"a series of hypotheses\" that an adolescent \"tests against reality\". Because the imaginary audience is usually constructed based on an adolescent's attention on his own perception, it will be gradually modified through communicating and reacting with real audiences. Eventually, adolescents will be able to recognize the difference between his own preoccupations and concerns of others.\n\nAs to the passing of personal fable, Elkind's idea was drawn from Erikson's (1959) stages of psychosocial development. An establishment of what Erikson called \"intimacy\" could account for the elimination of personal fable, because during the process of establishing \"intimacy\", adolescents have to constantly adjust their imaginary audiences to the real ones. As a result, adolescents are able to see themselves in a more realistic way and to establish meaningful interpersonal relationships.\n\nA lot of research has examined different dimensions of Elkind's concept of adolescent egocentrism, however, the findings have not well supported the concept. According to this research, the manifestation of adolescent egocentrism is not a normative developmental phenomenon that occurs only during adolescence, but varies across different contexts. Main discussions from current literature focus on three aspects: whether adolescent egocentrism is age-related; whether adolescent egocentrism has association with formal operations; whether adolescent egocentrism weigh equally across genders.\n\nIn his 1967 work, Elkind claimed that adolescent egocentrism emerges during early adolescence (age 11–12) and gradually dissipates throughout middle and late adolescence. However, some findings from later studies indicate that this statement is not necessarily to be accurate. In 1986, Lapsley and his colleagues conducted two studies to examine the theoretical assumptions brought up by Elkind. In their first study they collected data from a sample that included 45 sixth graders, 39 eighth graders, 50 tenth graders and 49 twelfth graders. They used the Adolescent Egocentrism Scale (AES) developed by Enright et al. (1979, 1980) and paper-and-pencil battery of formal operations tasks developed by Lunzer (1965) as measuring instruments to examine the correlation between adolescent egocentrism and formal operational thought. \n\nIf Elkind's assumption were right, the correlation was supposed to change from positive to negative as the grade increased and the magnitude of the correlation should decrease with age. The results of the study obtained only significant negative correlation in late adolescence and non-significant change in the magnitude of the correlation. The results didn't support the Elkind's claim that adolescent egocentrism emerges in early adolescence and decreases linearly throughout middle and late adolescence. In other words, adolescents aged 11 or 12 could experience adolescent egocentrism of the same magnitude as those aged 15 or 16 do. Another study by Frankenberger (2000) also provides evidence that adolescent egocentrism is not age-related. \n\nIn this study, a survey was conducted for data collection from 223 adolescents and 131 adults. The survey contained measures of three aspects: adolescent egocentrism, self-consciousness, and interpersonal reactivity. The result revealed that scores of egocentrism were not, on average, significantly different between adolescents and young adults (19-30), which indicates that egocentrism in adolescence may continue into adulthood.\n\nAn important theoretical assumption in Elkind's theory is that the emergence of adolescence egocentrism is a result of the development of formal operational thoughts. Nevertheless, some studies had findings that were contrast to Elkind's position. Lapsley and his colleagues conducted two studies to examine the theoretical assumptions in 1986. In the second study, they analyzed the data obtained from two samples: a sample of 7th-, 9th-and 11th-graders and another sample of college undergraduate students. They used Adolescent Egocentrism Scale (AES) (Enright et al., 1979, 1980), Lunzer (1965) formal operations measure and Imaginary Audience Scale (IAS) (Elkind & Bowen, 1979) as the instruments. \n\nThe result of a grade-by-grade analysis of inter-correlations between adolescence egocentrism and formal operational thoughts showed modest to non-significant differences among all the measures, which implies that there is little association between adolescent egocentrism and formal operations. Some more recent studies got similar findings. Heather et al. (1993) found that formal operations were not an effective indicator of both imaginary audience and personal fable. Galanaki (2012) performed a research to investigate the association of adolescent egocentrism with age, gender, pubertal development and formal operational thoughts.\n\nA considerable amount of studies have found gender differences in egocentrism (Smetana, J.G.&VillaLobos M., 2010). Kimberly A Schonert-Reichl's (1994) study on the relationship between depressive symptomatology and adolescent egocentrism recruited 62 adolescents (30 males, 32 females) aged from 12 to 17. The study used Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale (RADS), Imaginary Audience Scale (IAS) and the New Personal Fable Scale (NPFS) as measuring tools. The results revealed significantly higher scores obtained by females compared with males in the Transient Self subscale in IAS. \n\nTransient Self, as defined by Elkind and Bowen in 1979, refers to impermanent image of self that is mainly relative to one-time behaviors and temporary appearance. Thus, adolescent females have a higher tendency to consider themselves to be different from others, and tend to be more self-conscious in situations that involve momentary embarrassments (e.g. going to a party with a bad haircut), than their male peers. Another study conducted by Goossens and Beyers (1992) using similar measuring instruments found that boys have stronger beliefs that they are unique, invulnerable and sometimes omnipotent, which are typical characteristics of personal fable.\n\n"}

It is owned and created by Afarin Neyssari. The gallery comprises two exhibitions halls for dual exhibitions based in the: Sheikh Bahaei area in northern Tehran. Aun calls itself the Iran's first commercial art space designed and built to showcase contemporary art. The building offers 120 square meters of open exhibition space, a five-meter high ceiling and a paneled roof to provide maximum natural light. The gallery's unique architectural features allow for exhibitions of various arts including painting, photography, sculpture, video, installation and performance.\n\nAun Gallery was established in September 2009 to promote young Iranian artists and support their contribution to Iran's cultural scene. The gallery holds ten to eleven solo exhibits per year, lasting approximately one month at a time. The gallery also hosted mixed media sculpture specialist Bita Fayyazi in 2009.\n\nThe Vanak area has been popular with Iranian artists since the early 2000s, at which time it was a quiet residential area with light industry. More recently it has undergone extensive redevelopment with cafes, restaurants and media businesses. Sheikh Bahaei Square is a prime site with a central area of dining areas and shopping precincts.\n\nAun's owner, Afarin Neyssari, and her husband Karan Vafadari were arrested in Tehran’s Imam Khomeini International Airport by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Intelligence Service (IRGIS) on 20 July 2016 when she was about to board a plane to travel to Italy in order to jump start an important art project, which was to prepare for Mr. Bizhan Bassiri’s solo exhibition at the Venice Biennale festival as approved and certified by the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art and the Minister of Culture. Karan was supposed to join her a few days later on their trip, and to visit his three children who live in the US. Karan received a call from Afarin, and when he went to see her he too was arrested.\n\nAfarin and Karan were held in solitary confinement for over one month, and were not allowed to speak to a lawyer for 5 months. Afarin first spoke to a lawyer when she first showed up in court, 5 months after imprisonment. The Iranian judiciary has coerced the family to dismiss their chosen lawyer multiple times, and as of May 2017, they still have not found a suitable lawyer. As a Zoroastrian, Karan could be another example in a history of confiscation of Zoroastrians' property.\n\nKaran is a US citizen, and Afarin is a Greencard holder. A wave of public support for Karan and Afarin followed, from the artistic community within Iran, as well as from customers and friends of Aun Gallery. Robert Toscano, former ambassador from Italy to Iran, refuted the authorities’ justification for their detention in an open letter, saying that “One has to be truly gullible and the easy victim of propaganda” to accept such charges. He continued, “The reason must be a different one…political blackmail toward the US (of which [she is] also citizens), envy for their success, intimidation toward the Zoroastrian community, desire to grab their properties, [and] repression of contemporary art.”\n\nAun Gallery has appeared in magazines and publications such as Bidoun, as well as other local and international publications.\n\nThe gallery also featured in international travel magazine websites and online magazine \"The Culture Trip\".\n\nAun Gallery was also instrumental in the creation of the \"Tehran Gallery Guide\", a dual English and Persian publication highlighting the upcoming month's art events in the Iranian capital.

This production laid the foundation of Azerbaijan State Theatre of Musical Comedy. By 1938, musical comedies were displayed on the stage of Azerbaijan State Academic Opera and Ballet Theater. In 1938, an independent theatre of musical comedy (with Azerbaijani and Russian departments), which acquired official status of \"Azerbaijan State Theatre of Musical Comedy\" in September of the same year, was organized. In 1939, the first Azerbaijani and Soviet musical comedies such as \"Bride for 5 manats\" (S.Rustamov), \"Husband and wife\",\"The married bachelor\", (later \"Whose wedding?\") (A.Mashadibeyov) and \"Roza\" (S.Hajibeyov) were staged.

Its primary mission is to foster a secular society based on science, reason, freedom of inquiry, and humanist values. CFI has headquarters in the United States and a number of locations around the world.\n\nCenter for Inquiry focuses on two primary subject areas:\nCFI is also active in promoting a scientific approach to medicine and health. The organization has been described as a think tank and as a non-governmental organization.\n\nIn January 2016, the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science announced that it was merging with the Center for Inquiry, with Robyn Blumner as the CEO of the combined organizations.\n\nThe Center for Inquiry was established in 1991 by philosopher and author Paul Kurtz. It brought together two organizations: the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP) and the (CSH). CSICOP and CSH had previously operated in tandem but were now formally affiliated under one umbrella.\n\nBy 1995 CFI had expanded into a new headquarters in Amherst, New York, and in 1996 opened its first branch office in Los Angeles, CFI West currently named CFI Los Angeles. In the same year, CFI founded the Campus Freethought Alliance, organizing college students around its areas of interest.\n\nBy 1997 CFI had begun expanding its efforts internationally through an association with Moscow State University.\n\nBetween 2002 and 2003 CFI opened two new branches in New York City and Tampa, Florida in addition to expanding its west coast branch into a new building in Hollywood, California. Located on Hollywood Boulevard, CFI Los Angeles also became home to the Steve Allen Theater, named after the former \"Tonight Show\" host and CFI supporter. This property was sold in 2017 and CFI Los Angeles is now located at 2535 W, Temple St. Los Angeles, CA 90026.<br>\nIn 2004, CFI continued to expand into cities across the United States with the creation of a network of community organizations called CFI Communities.\nIn 2005 CFI once again expanded its Amherst headquarters with a new research wing. Additionally, CFI was granted special consultative status with the United Nations the same year.\n\nSince 2006 CFI has been expanding rapidly with a series of new branches in cities across North America and around the world. These include new Centers for Inquiry in Toronto, London, Washington, D.C., Indianapolis, Grand Rapids, Michigan, and Austin, Texas. The branch in Washington is headquarters to CFI's Office of Public Policy, which represents CFI's interests on Capitol Hill.\n\nTheir former affiliated organizations, the Council for Secular Humanism and the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, ceased to exist as independent organizations, and have become programs of Center for Inquiry, since January 2015.\nIn January 2016, CFI announced that it was merging with the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science, with Robyn Blumner as the CEO of the combined organizations.\n\nAccording to Paul Kurtz, in June 2009, being at odds with new CEO Ronald Lindsay, Kurtz was voted out as chairman. Kurtz has described the direction of CFI under Lindsay as \"angry atheism\" in contrast to his affirmative humanist philosophical approach. According to Ronald Lindsay,\"Paul Kurtz voluntarily resigned from his positions with CFI and all its affiliates, including his position as editor-in-chief of Free Inquiry.\" The Center for Inquiry Board Statement from 2010, thanks Kurtz for his \"decades of service\" and claims that \"Much of CFI’s success is due to Paul Kurtz’s inspiration and leadership.\" The release states that with Kurtz's encouragement, new leadership was sought out, with the goal of transitioning Kurtz away from the CEO position. The Board according to CFI prior to 2010 had become concerned with Kurtz's \"day-to-day management of the organization. In June 2008, the board appointed Dr. Ronald A. Lindsay president & CEO; in June 2009, the board elected Richard Schroeder chairman, with Dr. Kurtz moving to chairman emeritus.\" In May 2010, the Board accepted Kurtz's resignation from CFI.\n\nThrough the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI), and its journal, \"Skeptical Inquirer\" magazine, published by the Center for Inquiry, CSI evaluates claims of the paranormal (phenomena allegedly beyond the range of normal scientific explanations), such as psychic phenomena, ghosts, communication with the dead, and alleged extraterrestrial visitations. It also explores the fringes and borderlands of the sciences, attempting to separate strictly evidence-based research from pseudosciences.\n\nCSICOP was, alongside magician and prominent skeptic James Randi, sued by TV celebrity Uri Geller in the 1990s over claims made in the International Herald Tribune. The case ran for several years with Geller ordered to pay costs and other charges, and was ultimately settled in 1995.\n\nThe Independent Investigations Group, a volunteer group based at CFI Los Angeles, undertakes experimental testing of fringe claims. It offers a cash prize (as of 2014 this has a value of USD 100,000) for successful demonstration of supernatural effects. The IIG Awards (known as \"Iggies\") are presented for \"scientific and critical thinking in mainstream entertainment\". IIG has investigated, amongst other things, power bracelets, psychic detectives and a 'telepathic wonder dog'.\n\nThe Center promotes critical inquiry into the foundations and social effects of the world religions. Since 1983, initially through its connection with Committee for the Scientific Examination of Religion, it has focused on such issues as fundamentalism in Christianity and Islam, humanistic alternatives to religious ethics, and religious sources of political violence. It has taken part in protests against religious persecution around the world and opposes religious privilege, for example benefits for clergy in the US Tax Code.\n\nCFI actively supports secular interests, such as secular state education. It organizes conferences, such as \"Women In Secularism\"\n\nCFI also undertakes atheist education and support activities, for example sending freethought books to prisoners as part of its \"Freethought Books Project\".\n\nCFI is active in advocating free speech, and in promoting secular government. It speaks against institutional religion in the armed forces.\n\n\"Free Inquiry\" is published by the Center for Inquiry, in association with the Council for Secular Humanism.\n\nThe results of research and activities supported by the Center and its affiliates are published and distributed to the public in seventeen separate national and international magazines, journals, and newsletters. Among them are CSH's \"Free Inquiry\" and \"Secular Humanist Bulletin\", and CSI's \"Skeptical Inquirer\", CFI's \"American Rationalist.\" The \"Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine\", The \"Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice\" and \"Philo\", a journal covering philosophical issues, are no longer being published.\n\nCFI has produced the weekly radio show and podcast, Point of Inquiry since 2005. Episodes are available free for download from iTunes. Current host, as of June 2017, is Paul Fidalgo. Notable guests have included Steven Pinker, Neil deGrasse Tyson and Richard Dawkins.\n\nCFI On Campus (originally the Campus Freethought Alliance) is a program launched by the in 1996 by Derek Araujo and others in order to reach out to university and high school students. The Center for Inquiry On Campus provides funding, speakers or debaters, literature, and other promotional and educational resources to student groups that affiliate, and supports over 200 campus groups around the world.\n\nCenter for Inquiry On Campus is directed by Debbie Goddard, who is also the director of African Americans for Humanism. CFI on Campus employs a staff of organizers who help CFI student groups to advance their aims at their respective schools.\n\nThe Skeptic's Toolbox was an annual four-day workshop at the University of Oregon, Eugene sponsored by CFI devoted to scientific skepticism. It was formed by psychologist and now-retired University of Oregon professor Ray Hyman, has been held every August since 1992. The workshop focuses on educating people to be better critical thinkers, and involves a central theme. The attendees are broken up into groups and given tasks that they must work on together and whose results they must present in front of the entire group on the last day.\n\nThe Center for Inquiry Libraries began as a small collection of books located in the offices of CSICOP in the late 1970s. When the first expansion of the Center for Inquiry building was completed in 1995, the library was prominently featured. The building opened on June 9, 1995, with such luminaries as Leon Jaroff, Herbert Hauptman, Stan Lundine, and Kendrick Frazier attending, and Steve Allen, prominent supporter of CFI, spoke at the opening ceremony.\n\nGordon Stein was the Libraries’ first director and acquired a large number of rare materials. Timothy Binga has been the Director of Libraries since 1996, and has been instrumental in the cataloging and organization of the large amount of materials acquired.\nCFI’s Libraries were created along the same lines as the organization; CSICOP and the Council for Secular Humanism had their own libraries, and there were a number of shared libraries and collections as well. Highlights of the various collections include materials from Martin Gardner (some papers and books), Steve Allen (bound notebooks of clippings, notes, letters, and tipped-in pamphlets organized by subject), Martin T. Orne collection of books, papers, and case notes, and books and papers of noted philosophers Abraham Edel, Paul Edwards, Patrick Romanell, and Joseph Blau.\n\nIt total, the books number around 70,000 volumes; this includes the world’s foremost collections on skepticism, humanism, and freethought. Also, there are world-class collections on science, philosophy, American Philosophical Naturalism, the occult and paranormal, atheism, and other items related to the mission of the Center for Inquiry. In addition, there are archives, a reference section, periodicals, microfilm, and AV materials.\n\nThe Rare Book Room contains a signed Elizabeth Cady Stanton autobiography, first editions of such works as \"The Age of Reason\" by Thomas Paine, \"Reason: The Only Oracle of Man\" by Ethan Allen, many signed works by Robert Green Ingersoll, hard copies of \"The Truth Seeker\" (the newspaper of record for the Golden Age of Freethought), and a collection of Little Blue Books.\n\nCFI Libraries are a member of OCLC, the Western New York Library Resources Council (WNYLRC), New York Heritage and the Digital Public Library of America.\n\nThe Center for Inquiry has an emergency fund called Secular Rescue, formerly known as the Freethought Emergency Fund. The fund is used to help freethought activists whose lives are under threat by Islamic radicals linked to Al Qaeda. Between 2015 and 2018, Secular Rescue, helped thirty individuals fleeing anti-secular regimes gain asylum.\n\nThe Office of Public Policy (OPP) is the Washington D.C. political arm of the Center for Inquiry. The OPP’s mandate is to lobby Congress and the Administration on issues related to science and secularism. This includes defending the separation of church and state, promoting science and reason as the basis of public policy, and advancing secular values.\n\nThe OPP publishes position statements on its subjects of interest. Examples have included acupuncture, climate change, contraception and intelligent design. The Office is an active participant in legal matters, providing experts for Congress testimony and amicus briefs in Supreme Court cases. It publishes a list of bills it considers of interest as they pass through the U.S. legislative process.\n\nIn partnership with the Graduate School of Education at the State University of New York at Buffalo, CFI offers an accredited Master of Education program in Science and the Public, available entirely online. Aimed at students preparing for careers in research, science education, public policy, science journalism, or further study in sociology, history and philosophy of science, science communication, education, or public administration, the program explores the methods and outlook of science as they intersect with public culture, scientific literacy, and public policy.\n\nThe Skeptics and Humanist Aid and Relief Effort (previously the name began with the phrase \"Secular Humanist\") provides \"an alternative for those who wish to contribute to charitable efforts without the intermediary of a religious organization in times of great need.\" As of January 2010, all funds are being directed to the group Doctors Without Borders to aid the survivors of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Previous relief efforts have included aid for survivors of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake and the October 2007 California wildfires.\n\nThe following projects and programs are no longer active.\n\nThe Center for Inquiry organized an annual summer camp for children called \"Camp Inquiry\", focusing on scientific literacy, critical thinking, naturalism, the arts, humanities, and humanist ethical development. Camp Inquiry has been described as \"a summer camp for kids with questions\" where spooky stories were followed by \"reverse engineering sessions\" as the participants were encouraged to determine the cause of an apparently supernatural experience. Camp Inquiry has been criticised as \"Jesus Camp in reverse\"; its organisers countered that the camp is not exclusive to atheist children and that campers are encouraged to draw their own conclusions based on empirical and critical thinking.\n\nThe Center for Inquiry Institute offered undergraduate level online courses, seminars, and workshops in critical thinking and the scientific outlook and its implications for religion, human values, and the borderlands of science. In addition to transferable undergraduate credit through the University at Buffalo system, CFI offered a thirty credit-hour Certificate of Proficiency in Critical Inquiry. The three-year curriculum plan offered summer sessions at the main campus at the University at Buffalo in Amherst.\n\nThe Commission for Scientific Medicine and Mental Health (CSMMH) stimulated critical scientific scrutiny of New Age medicine and the schools of psychotherapy. It supported naturalistic addiction recovery practices through Secular Organizations for Sobriety. CFI challenges the claims of alternative medicine and advocates a scientific basis for healthcare. CSMMH papers have covered topics such as pseudoscience in autism treatments and in psychiatry.\n\nCFI also ran the Naturalism Research Project, a major effort to develop the theoretical and practical applications of philosophical naturalism. As part of this project, CFI’s libraries, research facilities, and conference areas were available to scientists and scholars to advance the understanding of science’s methodologies and conclusions about naturalism.\n\nActivities of the Naturalism Research Project included lectures and seminars by visiting fellows and scholars; academic conferences; and support CFI publications of important research. Among the central issues of naturalism include the exploration of varieties of naturalism; problems in philosophy of science; the methodologies of scientific inquiry; naturalism and humanism; naturalistic ethics; planetary ethics; and naturalism and the biosciences.\n\nCFI is a nonprofit body registered as a charity in the United States. It has 17 locations in the U.S., and has 16 international branches or affiliated organizations. The organization has Centers For Inquiry in Amherst, New York (its headquarters), Los Angeles, New York City, Tampa Bay, Washington, D.C., Indiana, Austin, Chicago, San Francisco and Michigan.\n\nCFI has branches, representation or affiliated organizations in countries around the world. It organizes its international activities under the banner \"Center For Inquiry Transnational\". In addition, CFI holds consultative status to the United Nations as an NGO under the UN Economic and Social Council. The Center participates in UN Human Rights Council debates, for example a debate on the subject of female genital mutilation during 2014.\n\nCFI Moscow operates an exchange program where Russian students and scholars are able to visit CFI headquarters in Amherst and participate in a summer institute each year. Additional international programs exist in Germany (Rossdorf), France (Nice), Spain (Bilbao), Poland (Warsaw), Nigeria (Ibadan), Uganda (Kampala), Kenya (Nairobi), Nepal (Kathmandu), India (Pune) (Hyderabad), Egypt (Cairo), China (Beijing), New Zealand (Auckland), Peru (Lima), Argentina (Buenos Aires), Senegal (Dakar), Zambia (Lusaka), and Bangladesh (Dacca).\n\nCFI Canada (CFIC) is the Canadian branch of CFI Transnational, headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Justin Trottier served as National Executive Director from 2007-2011. Originally established and supported in part by CFI Transnational, CFI Canada has become an independent Canadian national organization with several provincial branches. CFI Canada has branches in Halifax, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Saskatoon, Calgary, Okanagan (Kelowna) and Vancouver.\n\n\nCFI participates in media debates on science, health, religion and its other areas of interest. Its \"Keep Healthcare Safe and Secular\" campaign promotes scientifically sound healthcare. It has been an outspoken critic of dubious and unscientific healthcare practices, and engages in public debate on the merit and legality of controversial medical techniques. In 2014, CEO Ron Lindsay publicly criticized Stanislaw Burzynski's controversial Texas cancer clinic.\n\nCFI campaigns for a secular society, for example in opposing the addition of prayer text on public property. The Center supports secular and free speech initiatives.\n\nOn November 14, 2006 the CFI opened its Office of Public Policy in Washington, DC and issued a declaration \"In Defense of Science and Secularism\", which calls for public policy to be based on science rather than faith. The next day the Washington Post ran an article about it entitled \"Think Tank Will Promote Thinking\".\n\nIn 2011, video expert James Underdown of IIG and CFI Los Angeles did an experiment for \"Miracle Detective\" Oprah Winfrey Network which replicated exactly the angelic apparition that people claim cured a 14-year-old severely disabled child at Presbyterian Hemby Children's Hospital in Charlotte, North Carolina. The \"angel\" was sunlight from a hidden window, and the girl remained handicapped.\n\nIn July 2018 CFI filed suit against CVS in the District of Columbia for consumer fraud over its sale and marketing of ineffective homeopathic medicine. The lawsuit in part accuses the country’s largest drug retailer of deceiving consumers through its misrepresentation of homeopathy’s safety and effectiveness, wasting customers’ money and putting their health at risk. Nicholas Little, CFI’s Vice President and General Counsel said, “CVS is taking cynical advantage of their customers’ confusion and trust in the CVS brand, and putting their health at risk to make a profit and they can’t claim ignorance. If the people in charge of the country’s largest pharmacy don’t know that homeopathy is bunk, they should be kept as far away from the American healthcare system as possible.”\n\nDuring Richard Dawkins' October 2011 book tour, Center for Inquiry - the tour's sponsor - signed a contract with Wyndgate Country Club in Rochester Hills, Michigan, as the venue site. After seeing an interview with Dawkins on \"The O'Reilly Factor\", an official at the club cancelled Dawkins' appearance. Dawkins said that the country club official accepted Bill O'Reilly's \"twisted\" interpretation of his book \"The Magic of Reality\" without having read it personally. Sean Faircloth said that cancelling the reading \"really violates the basic principles of America ... The Civil Rights Act ... prohibits discrimination based on race or religious viewpoint. ... [Dawkins has] published numerous books ... to explain science to the public, so it's rather an affront, to reason in general, to shun him as they did.\" CFI Michigan executive director Jeff Seaver stated that \"This action by The Wyndgate illustrates the kind of bias and bigotry that nonbelievers encounter all the time.\" Following the cancellation, protests and legal action by CFI against the Wyndgate Country Club were pursued. In 2013 this case was settled in favor of the Center For Inquiry.\n\nIn 2007, CSH sued the Florida Department of Corrections (DOC) to block the use of state funds in contracts to faith-based programs for released inmates, claiming that this use is prohibited under the \"No Aid\" provision or Blaine amendment of the Florida constitution. The initial decision found in favor of the DOC but, on appeal, the case was remanded in 2010 on just the issue of the unconstitutionality of appropriating state funds for this purpose.\n\nWhile this case was in progress, after the appellate finding, Republican legislators began an effort to amend the Florida constitution to remove the language of the Blaine amendment, succeeding in 2011 to place the measure on the 2012 ballot as amendment 8. \nThe ballot measure failed.\n\nIn 2015, CHS (now CFI) and the state (along with its co-defendants) both filed for summary judgement. The court granted the state's motion in January, 2016, allowing the contested contracting practice to continue. After consideration, CFI announced in February, 2016, that it would not appeal.\n\nCFI representative Josephine Macintosh was repeatedly interrupted and heckled whilst presenting the Center's position on censorship at the UN Human Rights Council. CFI advocated free speech, and opposed the punishment by Saudi authorities of Raif Badawi for running an Internet forum, whom they accused of atheism and liberalism. The Saudi delegation objected repeatedly to CFI's statement. CFI drew support from American, Canadian, Irish and French delegates.\n\nBlasphemy Rights Day International encourages individuals and groups to openly express their criticism of or outright contempt for religion. It was founded in 2009 by the Center for Inquiry. A student contacted the Center for Inquiry in Amherst, New York to present the idea, which CFI then supported. Ronald Lindsay, president and CEO of the Center for Inquiry said regarding Blasphemy Day, \"We think religious beliefs should be subject to examination and criticism just as political beliefs are, but we have a taboo on religion\", in an interview with CNN. It takes place every September 30 to coincide with the anniversary of the publications of the controversial Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons.\n\nBlasphemy Day and CFI's related Blasphemy Contests started (in CFI's own words) \"a firestorm of controversy\". The use of confrontational free speech has been a topic of debate within the Humanist movement \n\n"}

An important concept within Chinese social relations is the concept of face, as in many other Asian cultures. A Buddhist-related concept is \"yuanfen\" (缘分/緣分).\n\nAs articulated in the sociological works of leading Chinese academic Fei Xiaotong, the Chinese—in contrast to other societies—tend to see social relations in terms of networks rather than boxes.

This means that computers are used to model, simulate, and analyze social phenomena. Fields include computational economics, computational sociology, cliodynamics, culturomics, and the automated analysis of contents, in social and traditional media. It focuses on investigating social and behavioral relationships and interactions through social simulation, modeling, network analysis, and media analysis.\n\nThere are two terminologies that relate to each other: Social Science Computing (SSC) and Computational Social Science (CSS). In literature, CSS is referred to the field of social science that uses the computational approaches in studying the social phenomena.\nOn the other hand, SSC is the field in which computational methodologies are created to assist in explanations of social phenomena.\n\nComputational social science revolutionizes both fundamental legs of the scientific method: empirical research, especially through big data, by analyzing the digital footprint left behind through social online activities; and scientific theory, especially through computer simulation model building through social simulation. It is a multi-disciplinary and integrated approach to social survey focusing on information processing by means of advanced information technology. The computational tasks include the analysis of social networks, social geographic systems, social media content and traditional media content.\n\nComputational social science work increasingly relies on the greater availability of large databases, currently constructed and maintained by a number of interdisciplinary projects, including: \n\nThe analysis of vast quantities of historical newspaper content has been pioneered in, while other studies on similar data showed how periodic structures can be automatically discovered in historical newspapers.

In the genre pioneered by William Gibson, power is largely in the hands of megacorporations which often maintain their own private armies and security forces and wage corporate warfare against each other.\n\nSuch warfare may be part of economic warfare and cyberwarfare.\nAccording to Schwartau in corporate information warfare companies are targeted, typically by their competitors. Such warfare may include methods of industrial espionage, spreading disinformation, leaking confidential information and damaging a company's information systems.\n\nChris Rouland of the cybersecurity & cyberarms company Endgame, Inc. controversially advocated that private companies should be allowed to \"hack back\" against nations or criminals trying to steal their data. After a wave of high-profile attacks against US companies and government databases a panel of experts assembled by the George Washington University Center for Cyber and Homeland Security said policies should be eased to allow \"active defense\" measures to deter hackers and did not recommend hacking back \"because [they] don't want the cure to be worse than the disease\". Relevantly on the February 2017 RSA Conference Microsoft President Brad Smith stated that technology companies need to preserve trust and stability online by pledging neutrality in cyber conflict.\n\nThe dramatic increase in the use of the Internet for business purposes has exposed private entities to greater risks for cyber-attacks. Garcia and Horowitz propose a game theoretic approach which considers economic motivations for investment in Internet security and investigate a scenario in which firms plan for long-term security investment by considering the likelihood of cyber-attacks.\n\nBotnets may be used to knock business competitors off line. They can be hired by corporations to disrupt the operation of competitors on the networks.\n\nLow-grade corporate warfare is constantly being waged between technology giants by \"patent trolls, insider blogs and corporate talking points\".\n\nSupply chain attacks in corporate warfare can be called supply chain interdiction.\nThe term may also refer to the privatization of warfare mainly by the involvement of private military companies.\n\nIt has been speculated that the concept of \"non-international armed conflict within the meaning of Article 3 GC I to IV\" of the Fourth Geneva Convention would be wide enough to allow for covering \"a renaissance of corporate warfare\".\nIn 2016 a digital illustration series by the German Foreal design studio called \"Corporate Warfare\" visualized the power and impact of big brand corporations by branded torpedoes and atomic bombs. Dirk Schuster, cofounder of Foreal states that \"big corporations can have more power than governments, so we put them in a military context\".\n\nSam Esmail, creator of the television series \"Mr. Robot\", states that \"the next world war won't be fought with nukes, but with information, economics and corporate warfare.\n\n"}
{"id": "27714876", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27714876", "title": "Dieselpunk", "text": "Dieselpunk\n\nDieselpunk is a genre similar to steampunk that combines the aesthetics of the diesel-based technology of the interwar period through to the 1950s with retro-futuristic technology and postmodern sensibilities. Coined in 2001 by game designer Lewis Pollak to describe his role-playing game \"Children of the Sun\", the term has since been applied to a variety of visual art, music, motion pictures, fiction, and engineering.\n\nThe name \"dieselpunk\" is a derivative of the 1980s science fiction genre cyberpunk, and is used to represent the time period – or \"era\" – from the interwar period until the 1950s, when diesel-based locomotion was the main technological focus of Western culture. The \"-punk\" suffix attached to the name is representative of the counterculture nature of the genre with regards to its opposition to contemporary aesthetics. The term also refers to the tongue-in-cheek name given to a similar cyberpunk derivative, \"steampunk,\" which focuses on science fiction based on industrial steam power and which is often set within the Victorian era.\n\nAuthor Scott Westerfeld addresses the question of where to draw the line between steampunk and dieselpunk, arguing that his novel \"Leviathan\" (2009) qualifies as steampunk despite the fact that the technology it depicts includes diesel engines.\n\nI like the word \"dieselpunk\" if you are doing something like 'Weird World War II'. I think that makes perfect sense. But to me, World War I is the dividing point where modernity goes from being optimistic to being pessimistic. Because when you put the words \"machine\" and \"gun\" together, they both change. At that point, war is no longer about a sense of adventure and chivalry and a way of testing your nation's level of manhood; it's become industrial, and horrible. So playing around with that border between optimistic steampunk and a much more pessimistic dieselpunk, which is more about Nazis, was kind of interesting to me because early in the war we were definitely kind of on the steampunk side of that.\n\nJennifer McStotts, another author, considers the two genres to be close cousins. She defines steampunk as concerned with the Victorian era, and the shift in technology and energy generation that came with industrialisation. The genre is primarily concerned with steam power, Tesla, and sustainable energy, while she defines dieselpunk as the genre combining the aesthetic and genre influences of the period of both world wars.\n\nAcademic Gary K. Wolfe defines the genres by their era of setting. He defines steampunk as the genre primarily set in the Victorian era and dieselpunk as the genre primarily set in the interwar period.\n\nDieselpunk draws its inspiration from two related sources: the diesel era and a characteristic referred to by dieselpunks as \"decodence.\" According to the web site \"The Gatehouse\", decodence (a portmanteau of \"deco\" and \"decadence\"), \"embraces the styles and technologies of the era; it rejoices in a prolonged Jazz Age ambience characterized by great enthusiasm and hopes about the future.\"\n\nThe term \"diesel era\" is a period of time that begins with the start of the interbellum era, which covers the time between the end of World War I and the start of World War II. The interbellum era is central to one school of dieselpunk often labeled \"Ottensian.\" In addition to the interbellum period, World War II also plays a major role in dieselpunk, especially in the school of the genre referred to as \"Piecraftian.\" (See \"Common themes found in dieselpunk fiction\", below.) The exact ending of the diesel era is in some dispute in the dieselpunk community. Depending on the source it ends either at the conclusion of World War II or continues until the early part of the 1950s with the advent of such cultural icons as the Golden Age of Television and the replacement of Big Band and Swing music with Rock and Roll in popularity.\n\nAlthough the term \"dieselpunk\" was not coined until 2001, a large body of art significant to the development of the genre was produced before that. Artwork (including visual arts, music, literature, and architecture) created in the dieselpunk style are heavily influenced by elements of the art movements most prevalent in Western culture during the diesel era such as:\n\nAccording to Tome Wilson, owner of Dieselpunks website (www. dieselpunks.org), the term was retroactively applied to an already existing trend in literature. An alternative term was \"low-brow pop surrealism\". Writers of this trend blended traditional tropes and genres, such as Pulp Adventure, Film noir, and Weird Horror, with a contemporary aesthetic. In his words: \"They were creating a future fueled by the spirit of the Jazz Age.\" In their works, the reader could see Sam Spade in the era of smartphones and John Dillinger use a hovercar as his getaway vehicle. They were writing cyberpunk stories about the era of \"The Great Gatsby\" (1925).\n\nIn discussing punk genres, Ted Stoltz defines dieselpunk as the quasifuture from the Art Deco era. He argues that cyberpunk, steampunk, clockpunk, atompunk, and ribopunk are all defined by their connection to their respective technological element. He found this does not apply to other related genres such as elfpunk, mythpunk, and splatterpunk where technology plays a minor role.\n\nAlternative history and World War II feature prominently in dieselpunk literature. Examples of other dieselpunk novels are \"Tales of the First Occult War\" by Kevin Cooney, \"Fiends of the Eastern Front\" by David Bishop, and \"\" by New York Times bestselling novelist Larry Correia.\n\nA feature that was first identified by the online magazine \"The Flying Fortress\" is that dieselpunk can be divided into two primary themes or styles: Ottensian and Piecraftian. The dividing line between the two themes is commonly acknowledged as the start of World War II.\n\nOne theme, named \"Piecraftian\" after its proponent author \"Piecraft\", focuses on the aesthetics of the world wars and speculates on how human culture could theoretically cease to evolve due to constant, widespread warfare. According to Ottens and Piecraft this theme continues the aesthetics of the diesel era into later periods of history by describing a world where survival (largely based on a reliance on diesel power) is placed above aesthetical evolution (as seen in such dystopian movies as Mad Max).\n\nA second theme, named \"Ottensian\" after its proponent author Nick Ottens, focuses on a setting where the decadent aesthetics and utopian philosophies of the American \"Roaring Twenties\" continued to evolve unhindered by war or economic collapse. Ottensian dieselpunk fiction is primarily concerned with a positive vision of technology, where the utopian ideals predicted by the World's Fairs of the times came to light. As a result Ottensian dieselpunk incorporates \"an enthusiasm for the predictions about the future,\" and often shares elements with retro-futurism.\n\nDieselpunk features prominently in the gaming industry, in both tabletop role-playing games and computer and console video games. Dieselpunk video game titles have been extremely prominent in recent years, with the success of the popular \"Fallout\" (1997), and \"BioShock\" (2007) series of games. Sven Schmalfuss feels that \"BioShock\" can be defined as both retro-futuristic biopunk and dieselpunk.\n\nWorld War II is also a popular theme in dieselpunk games. One of the more prominent of these was Activision's \"Return to Castle Wolfenstein\", as well as the sequel game to the 2009 game \"Wolfenstein\", \"\", which takes place in an alternate 1960s Europe where the Nazis had won World War II. The game features many dieselpunk style weapons and robots, as the Nazis had focussed more on scientific and military development than social development. Other games set in dieselpunk versions of the World War II era include \"Crimson Skies\" (1998 board game, 2000 videogame), \"\" (1996), and \"Sine Mora\" (2012).\n\nWith regard to moving pictures, dieselpunk combines the tropes, character archetypes, and settings of diesel era fiction genres such as Serial Adventure, Noir, Pulp, and War with postmodern storytelling techniques and cinematography. Famous inspirations for dieselpunk cinema include \"Metropolis\" (1927) and \"Things To Come\" (1936), thanks to their period visions of utopian culture and technology. Even the popular film \"Star Wars\" (1977) has been noted as having strong dieselpunk influences, as it drew heavily on pulp and World War II iconography but mixed them with futuristic settings.\n\nSome commonly referenced examples of dieselpunk cinema include:\n\n\nAccording to an article titled \"Dieselpunk: Love Affair with a Machine\", published in the online magazine \"Dark Roasted Blend\", in dieselpunk art \"takes an interest in various bizarre machines, full of esoteric levers, cracked-glass meters – all visually intense and pretty sinister-looking, when photographed.\" The article references Japanese artist Shunya Yamashita's having created one of the definitive examples of dieselpunk art with his work \"I Can't Explain.\" The article also references Kow Yokoyama as a dieselpunk artist with his figurine series titled \"Maschinen Krieger.\"\n\nOther prominent artists in the dieselpunk movement include: Alexey Lipatov, Stefan Prohaczka, ixlrlxi, Keith Thompson, Rob Schwager, and Sam Van Olffen.\n\nA person defined as a dieselpunk draws inspiration and entertainment from the aesthetics of the diesel era to achieve independence from contemporary aesthetics by blending the literature, artwork, fashion, grooming styles, modes of personal transportation, music, and technology of the diesel era with contemporary sensibilities.\n\nPart of dieselpunk's postmodern nature can be seen in the important role that the internet as a tool of international communication plays in its development. In addition to two prominent dieselpunk online communities, \"Dieselpunks\" and \"The Gatehouse's\" \"Smoking Lounge\", there are a growing number of online magazines dedicated to the genre including \"The Flying Fortress\", \"Dizelpanki\" and several blogs which are simply titled \"Dieselpunk\". Another active online magazine covering the dieselpunk movement is \"Vintage Future: Dieselpunk\", which describes itself as \"Retro-futuristic resources from the golden era.\"\n\nWhile there are many websites dedicated to the history of the diesel era, a growing number of sites are dedicated to topics that tie directly into dieselpunk. One such website of note is \"RetroTimes Production\", which is an independent film production company dedicated to creating documentaries about \"retro living, retro design, and retro style.\" A few sites are springing up that have a retro pulp feel as well, including \"Captain Spectre and The Lightning Legion\", which is an online comic written and drawn in the classic serial pulp fiction style of the diesel era, and \"Thrilling Tales of the Downright Unusual\", an interactive Choose Your Own Adventure-style pulp serial.\n\nIn 2012, World Brews, a craft beer manufacturer in Novato, CA, began producing \"Dieselpunk Brew\", a beer line (IPA, Porter and Stout) inspired and influenced by the subculture of dieselpunk, and displaying art deco-inspired dieselpunk designs on the labels.\n\nDieselpunk fashion blends the styles commonly found during the diesel era with contemporary styles to create a fusion of both. The \"punk\" nature of the subculture comes from expressing a more complete presence in public akin to the fashion styles popular during the diesel era such as waistcoats, covered arms, hosiery, styles of shoes, and head wear. Dieselpunk emphasizes the inclusion of such accoutrements to render one's look \"complete,\" in defiance of modern custom.\n\nDieselpunk music, which has roots in the neo-swing revival, combines elements of blues, jazz, ragtime, cabaret, swing, and bluegrass commonly found during the diesel era with contemporary instrumentation, production, and composition. Some commonly referenced examples of dieselpunk bands are: Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, Royal Crown Revue, Squirrel Nut Zippers, The Brian Setzer Orchestra, Indigo Swing, Wolfgang Parker, The End Times Spasm Band, RPM Orchestra, Big Rude Jake, and Lee Press-on and the Nails.\n\nThere has been growth of a Dieselpunk music referred to as electro swing, which combines the styles of Swing music with Electronica. Prominent bands within the Electro-Swing include Caravan Palace, Good Co, and .\n\nDecopunk is a recent subset of Dieselpunk, inspired by the Art Deco and Streamline Moderne art styles of the period between the 1920s and 1950s. In an interview at CoyoteCon, steampunk author Sara M. Harvey made the distinctions \"... shinier than DieselPunk, more like DecoPunk\", and \"DieselPunk is a gritty version of Steampunk set in the 1920s–1950s. The big war eras, specifically. DecoPunk is the sleek, shiny very Art Deco version; same time period, but everything is chrome!\"\n\nA similar, related pop surrealist art movement, which overlaps with dieselpunk somewhat, is atompunk (sometimes called atomicpunk). Atompunk art relates to the pre-digital period of 1945–1965, including mid-century Modernism, the Atomic Age, Jet Age and Space Age, Communism and paranoia in the USA along with Soviet styling, underground cinema, Googie architecture, the Sputnik, Mercury and other early space programs, early Cold War espionage, superhero fiction and the rise of the US military/industrial powers.\n\n\n\n"}

The group held an annual 'Whitman Day' celebration around the 31 May which was the poet's birthday.\n\nWallace and Johnston corresponded with Whitman and Johnston visited Whitman at his home in Camden, New Jersey. Wallace visited Whitman in 1891. Wallace moved to Adlington in the early 1890s and invited Charles Sixsmith to join the group which continued until the death of Wallace in 1926 and in a more modest form after that. After Wallace moved to Adlington in the early 1890s the group continued to meet in each other's homes. Sixsmith was involved in the annual Whitman celebrations until the late 1930s.

The name comes from the Spanish verb , and literally translates as \"enbreaded\", that is, wrapped or coated in bread.\n\nEmpanadas are made by folding dough over a stuffing, which may consist of meat, cheese, corn, or other ingredients.\n\nEmpanadas trace back their origins to the northwest region of Spain, Galicia. A cookbook published in Catalan in 1520, \"Libre del Coch\" by Robert de Nola, mentions empanadas filled with seafood in the recipes for Catalan, Italian, French, and Arabian food.\n\nArgentine empanadas are often served during parties and festivals as a starter or main course. Shops specialize in freshly made empanadas, with many flavors and fillings.\n\nThe dough is made with wheat flour and beef drippings for the fillings which differs from province to province. Some places use chicken, and some places beef (cubed or ground depending on the region) spiced with cumin and paprika. Some other fillings are onion, boiled egg, olives, or raisins. Empanadas can be baked or fried. It also can contain ham, fish, \"humita\" (sweetcorn with white sauce), or spinach; a fruit filling is used to create a dessert empanada. For the interior regions, they can be spiced with peppers.\n\nIn those places (usually take-out shops) where several types are served, a \"repulgue\", or pattern, is added to the pastry fold to distinguish the varieties (although it is more common nowadays to burn a letter – an abbreviated indication of the filling – into the dough). In larger cities, empanadas are eaten more as take-away food, sourced from restaurants specializing in this dish. They usually carry dozens of different varieties, which is not the case in northern provinces, where empanadas are usually made at home, with more traditional recipes.\n\nDuring Lent and Easter, \"empanadas de Cuaresma\" fillings with fish (usually dogfish or tuna) are popular.\n\nIn Belize, empanadas are known as \"panades\". They are made with masa (corn dough) and typically stuffed with fish, chicken, or beans. They are usually deep fried and served with a cabbage or salsa topping. Panades are frequently sold as street food.\n\nCape Verde cuisine features the \"pastel\", as well. Cape Verdean \"pastéis\" are often filled with spicy tuna fish. One particular variety, the \"pastel com o diabo dentro\" (literally: Pastel with the devil within), is particularly spicy, and is made with a dough made from sweet potatoes and cornmeal.\n\nThe empanada is considered the most symbolic food of the country. Salvador Allende, the President of Chile from 1970 to 1973, emphasized the national character of his political project saying that it would be a \"revolution with the flavor of red wine, and the scent of an empanada\".\n\nEating empanadas, especially the meat ones called \"empanadas de pino\", becomes more popular during September, the month that Chile celebrates las fiestas patrias or their independence. They are eaten during meals like asados or Chilean barbeques, and are accompanied with drinks like la chicha and red wine.\n\nMeat empanadas (\"de pino\") are filled with ground beef, fried with white onion and are seasoned with garlic, hard-boiled eggs, olives, and sometimes raisins. This version is known as the typical baked Chilean empanada, although it can also be fried. \n\nSeafood empanadas are filled with crab, clams, sea snails, or special oysters called crassostrea and cheese. Different seafood can be used, and they are mixed with chopped white onion.\n\nFilipino empanadas usually contain ground beef, pork or chicken, potatoes, chopped onions, and raisins (somewhat similar to the Cuban \"picadillo\") in a somewhat sweet, wheat flour bread. There are two kinds available: the baked sort and the flaky fried type. To lower costs, potatoes are often added as an extender, while another filling is \"kutsay\", or garlic chives (\"kutsay\" in Cebuano and Tagalog; 韭菜 \"kú-chhài\" in Lan-nang).\n\nEmpanadas in the northern part of the Ilocos are different. These usually have savoury fillings of green papaya, mung beans, and sometimes chopped Ilocano sausage (\"chorizo\") and egg yolk. \n\nThe 'Mpanatigghi are stuffed, consisting of halfmoon-shaped panzarotti filled with a mixture of almonds, walnuts, chocolate, sugar, cinnamon, cloves and minced beef. These are typical of Modica, in the province of Ragusa, Sicily. They are also known as \"impanatiglie\" or \"dolce di carne\" (pasty of meat).\n\nThey were probably introduced by the Spaniards during their rule in Sicily which took place in the sixteenth century; this is suggested from the etymology of the name which comes from the Spanish \"empanadas or empadillas\" (empanada), as well as from the somewhat unusual combination of meat and chocolate, which occurs several times in the Spanish cuisine. In past centuries for the preparation of 'mpanatigghi game meat was used but today beef is used.\n\nEmpanadas, mainly based on South American recipes, are widely available in New York City and throughout New Jersey from food carts, food trucks, and restaurants. Empanadas are usually found in U.S. areas with a large Hispanic population, like Miami, San Antonio, and Los Angeles.\n\n\n"}

An example:\nSometimes the operator will mention the officer's honors, and may add other words in memoriam.\n\nIn some cases the call is made twice, once immediately after the officer's death, then more formally closer to the date of or actually at the officer's funeral. \n\nThe practice of the end of watch call began in the mid–2000s in police departments on the East Coast of the United States. By 2010 the practice had spread to the West Coast, and to firefighters, forest rangers, and game wardens in the United States and Canada.\n\nThe custom as practiced in the New York Police Department was depicted in \"End Of Watch,\" an episode of the police procedural \"Elementary\". The practice of the Los Angeles Police Department was shown in \"Reckoning,\" an episode of \"Southland\". On the soap opera \"General Hospital\", the character Jordan Ashford uses the radio to make the Last Call to Nathan West, an officer killed in the line of duty by his father, Cesar Faison. An End of Watch call also occurs in one of the final episodes of the dramatic comedy \"The Mysteries of Laura\", starring Debra Messing and Josh Lucas.\n\n"}

He was the eldest child of the mason Maurizio and his wife Elisabetta Bertoncin. Maurizio intended that his son should also be a mason, yet at a young age, Fausto showed a great ability at drawing. With his parents’ consent, he enrolled first in the Technical Institute in Lendinara, then in the Cignaroli Academy in Verona under Napoleone Nani. Fausto opened a small art school and studio in Venice, but traveled often to Naples as well. He felt no clear direction in his life at that time.\n\nHe actively displayed works in exhibition and gained respect of critics. He painted mainly genre works in oil and watercolor. In 1883 at Milan, he exhibited: \"Le rivelatrici napoletane\"; \"Da Sant'Elmo\", and \"Al Pincio\"; in Rome, the canvases \"Passa la vacca\"; \"La sofferente\"; \"Le cucitrici napoletane\", and \"Il saponaro\". In 1884, at Turin: \"Tempesta\"; \"Primo nato\"; \"Primo tuono\", and the \"Zoccolaro of Naples\"; and in 1887 at Venice: \"In attesa\"; \"Al Redentoretto\", and \"Lavoratrice di perle\". La casa Camerini of Padua once possessed a \"banditore\"; and two canvases: \"I pigiatori\" and \"In medio stat virtus\".\n\nThe turning point in Zonaro’s career occurred however in 1891, when he fell in love with Elisabetta Pante, a pupil of his in Venice, And together they traveled to Istanbul, capital of the Ottoman Empire. They were partly inspired by Edmondo de Amicis’ orientalist travel book \"Constantinopoli\".\n\nIn 1892, Zonaro and Pante married, and lived in the Istanbul neighborhood of Pera.\n\nIn Istanbul, over time he gained patronage in aristocratic circles. Munir Pasha, the Minister of Protocol, who invited him to visit Yıldız Palace and meet the prestigious local artist Osman Hamdi Bey. He was employed in teaching painting to the Pasha's wife, and in this way Zonaro and Pante got to know the important artistic figures of Istanbul of that time. In 1896 he was nominated as the court painter (Ottoman Turkish: \"Ressam-ı Hazret-i Şehriyari\") thanks to the intervention of the Russian ambassador who had presented the ruling sultan Abdulhamid II with Zonaro’s work \"Il reggimento imperiale di Ertugrul sul ponte di Galata\" (in English: \"The Imperial Regiment of the Ertugrul on the Galata Bridge\"), which Abdulhamid II had then purchased.\n\nThe Sultan later commissioned from Zonaro a series of paintings depicting events in the life of the 15th-century Ottoman sultan, Mehmed II. Holding the position of court painter, Zonaro viewed himself as the successor to the Venetian painter Gentile Bellini, who had been commissioned by Mehmed II to paint his portrait over 300 years earlier.\n\nAlso during his stay in Istanbul, Zonaro witnessed the Day of Ashura processions carried out by the Shia Muslims on the tenth of Muharram, and it was the procession of Tatbir that inspired him to paint his renowned painting \"10th of Muharram\", it was reported that Zonaro said \"After witnessing the horripilating procession (of Tatbir) I wish I were able to meet this man they mourn for\". The \"man\" Zonaro speaks of indicates to the oppressed grandson of the Muslim prophet Mohammed, Hussein ibn Ali.\n\nZonaro remained in Istanbul until 1909, when he returned to Italy following the Young Turk Revolution that overthrew his patron Abdulhamid II and the shift to constitutional monarchy. There would be no Ottoman court painter after him. He settled in Sanremo where he continued to paint small works depicting the Italian Riviera and the nearby French Riviera until his death.\n\nIn 1920 he separated from his wife and began living with his daughter. Nine years later, he died. He is buried in the Foce Cemetery in Sanremo. On his gravestone, underneath an Ottoman \"tughra\", it states that Zonaro was the court painter of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nZonaro painted portraits, landscapes and historical paintings. It is claimed that “Zonaro was one of those who made a major contribution to the development of western style art in Turkey.” He was a prolific artist who created hundreds of works, most of which are of the Ottoman Empire. An exhibition of his work in Florence in 1977 \"received wide acclaim in the art world\".\n\nToday, most of Zonaro’s works remain in Istanbul, and many of them are on display in the city’s leading museums. His pictures can be found in the state museums of Topkapı Palace, Dolmabahçe Palace and the Istanbul Military Museum. Zonaro’s works can also be found in the private Sakıp Sabancı Museum and Pera Museum. Also, a number of them belong to private collectors in Turkey.\n\nSome of Zonaro's paintings are in the Pera Art Museum in Istanbul (including \"Daughter of the English Ambassador Riding in a Palanquin\") and the Istanbul Museum of Modern Art.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "417422", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=417422", "title": "Flag of Argentina", "text": "Flag of Argentina\n\nThe flag of Argentina is a triband, composed of three equally wide horizontal bands coloured light blue and white. There are multiple interpretations on the reasons for those colors. The flag was created by Manuel Belgrano, in line with the creation of the Cockade of Argentina, and was first raised at the city of Rosario on February 27, 1812, during the Argentine War of Independence. The National Flag Memorial was later built on the site. The First Triumvirate did not approve the use of the flag, but the Asamblea del Año XIII allowed the use of the flag as a war flag. It was the Congress of Tucumán which finally designated it as the national flag, in 1816. A yellow Sun of May was added to the center in 1818.\n\nThe full flag featuring the sun is called the Official Ceremonial Flag (). The flag without the sun is considered the Ornamental Flag (). While both versions are equally considered the national flag, the ornamental version must always be hoisted below the Official Ceremony Flag. In vexillological terms, the Official Ceremonial Flag is the civil, state and war flag and ensign, while the Ornamental Flag is an alternative civil flag and ensign. \nThere is controversy of the true colour of the first flag, between scientist and the descendants of Manuel Belgrano between blue and pale blue.\n\nThe flag of Argentina was created by Manuel Belgrano during the Argentine War of Independence. While in Rosario he noticed that both the royalist and patriotic forces were using the same colors, Spain's yellow and red. After realizing this, Belgrano created the Cockade of Argentina, which was approved by the First Triumvirate on February 18, 1812. Encouraged by this success, he created a flag of the same colors nine days later. It used the colors that were used by the \"Criollos\" during the May Revolution in 1810. However, recent research and studies would indicate that the colors were chosen from the Spanish Order of Charles III symbolizing the allegiance to the rightful, and then captive King Ferdinand VII of Spain. Most portraits about the creation or first uses of the flag show the modern design of it, but the flag of Macha, a very early design kept at the House of Freedom in Sucre, Bolivia was instead a vertical triband with two white bands and a light blue one in the middle.\nThe flag was first flown for soldiers to swear allegiance to it on 27 February 1812, on the \"Batería Libertad\" (Liberty Battery), by the Paraná River.\nOn that day, Belgrano said the following words:\n\nBelgrano dispatched a letter addressed to the First Triumvirate, informing them of the newly created flag. However, unlike with the cockade, the Triumvirate did not accept the use of the flag: policy at the time was to state that the government was ruling on behalf of King Ferdinand VII of Spain who was captive of Napoleon, whereas the creation of a flag was a clear independentist act. Thus, the triumvirate sent a warning to Belgrano not to fight under the flag, but by the time the reply had arrived, Belgrano had moved to the north, following the previous orders that requested him to strengthen the patriotic position in the Upper Peru after the defeat of Juan José Castelli at the Battle of Huaqui. Meanwhile, the flag was hoisted for the first time in Buenos Aires atop the Church of Saint Nicholas of Bari on August 23, 1812; where nowadays the Obelisk of Buenos Aires is located. Still not knowing about the Triumvirate's refusal, Belgrano raised the flag at San Salvador de Jujuy and had it blessed by the local church on the second anniversary of the May Revolution. Belgrano accepted the orders from the Triumvirate by time they arrived to Salta and ceased using the flag. As soldiers had already made oaths to the new flag, Belgrano said that he was saving it for the circumstance of a great victory. \n\nThe First Triumvirate was later replaced by the Second Triumvirate, with a more liberal ideology, who called the Asamblea del Año XIII. Despite being one of its original goals, it did not declare independence, and so did not approve the use of a national flag either; nevertheless, the flag made by Belgrano was authorized to be used as a war flag. The first oath to the newly approved flag was on February 13, 1813, next to the Salado River, which became known as the \"Río Juramento\" (\"Oath River\"). The first battle fought with the approved flag was the Battle of Salta, a decisive patriotic victory that achieved the complete defeat of royalist Pío Tristán.\n\nThe flag would be finally declared the national flag by the Congress of Tucumán on July 20, 1816, shortly after the declaration of independence. The proposal was made by the deputy Juan José Paso and the text written by the deputy of Charcas, José Serrano. On February 25, 1818, the Congress (now working at Buenos Aires) included the Sun of May in the war flag, after the proposal of deputy Chorroarín. The sun was copied after the one that the first Argentine coin featured in 1813. It was subsequently decided to keep it as part of the regular flag afterwards, and thus the sun no longer represents war.\n\nJosé de San Martín was aware of the new flag, but did not employ it during the crossing of the Andes in 1817. Being a joint operation of both Argentine and Chilean forces, he thought that a new flag would be a better idea than using either the Argentine or the Chilean flag. This led to the creation of the Flag of the Andes, used in the crossing. This flag is currently used as a provincial flag by Mendoza province.\n\nOn June 8, 1938, president Roberto Ortiz sanctioned national law no. 12,361 declaring June 20 \"Flag Day\", a national holiday. The date was decided as the anniversary of Belgrano's death in 1820. In 1957 the National Flag Memorial (a 10,000 m monumental complex) was inaugurated in Rosario to commemorate the creation of the flag, and the official Flag Day ceremonies have customarily been conducted in its vicinity since then.\n\nIn 1978 it was specified, among other measurements, that the Official Ceremony Flag should be 1.4 meters wide and 0.9 meters high, and that the sun must be embroidered.\n\nAccording to the Decree 10,302/1944 the article 2 stated that the Official Flag of the Nation is the flag with sun, approved by the \"Congress of Tucumán\", reunited in Buenos Aires on 25 February 1818. The article 3 stated that the flag with the sun in its center is to be used only by the Federal and Provincial Governments; while individuals and institutions use a flag without the sun.\n\nIn 1985 the Law 23,208 repealed the article 3 of the Decree 10,302/1944, saying that the Federal and Provincial Governments, as well as individuals have the right to use the Official Flag of the Nation.\n\nPopular belief attributes the colors to those of the sky, clouds and the sun; some anthems to the flag like \"Aurora\" or \"Salute to the flag\" state so as well. However, historians usually disregard this idea, and attribute them to loyalty towards the House of Bourbon.\n\nAfter the May Revolution, the first times of the Argentine War of Independence, the Triumvirate claimed to be acting on behalf of the Spanish King Ferdinand VII, who was prisoner of Napoleon Bonaparte during the Peninsular War. Whether such loyalty was real or a trick to conceal independentism is a topic of dispute. The creation of a new flag with those colors would have been then a way to denote autonomy, while keeping the relations with the captive king alive.\n\nFrom 1978, the flag's official proportions are 9:14, and its official size is 0.9 by 1.4 meters. It features three stripes alternating sky blue, white and sky blue. Each stripe is 30 centimeters high. In the center stripe there is an emblem known as the Sun of May (), a golden sun. Historian Diego Abad de Santillán claimed that the Sun of May was a representation of the Inca sun god Inti.\n\nFlags with proportions of 1:2 and 2:3 are also in use.\n\nThe colors are officially defined using the CIE 1976 standard:\nThe following are given for computer, textile, print and plastic use:\nThe Spanish word (sky blue) is used to describe the colour of the blue stripes.\nThe sun is called the Sun of May because it is a replica of an engraving on the first Argentine coin, approved in 1813, whose value was eight \"escudos\" (one Spanish dollar). It has 16 straight and 16 waved sunbeams.\n\nIn 1978 the sun color was specified to be golden yellow (), to have an inner diameter of 10 cm, and an outer diameter of 25 cm (the diameter of the sun equals the height of the white stripe. The sun's face is of its height). It features 32 rays, alternately wavy and straight, and from 1978 it must be embroidered in the \"Official Flag Ceremony\".\n\nThe French privateer Louis-Michel Aury used the Argentine flag as a model for the blue-white-blue flag of the first independent state in Central America, which was created 1818 in Isla de Providencia, an island off the east coast of Nicaragua. This state existed until approximately 1821, before the Gran Colombia took over control of these islands. Somewhat later (1823) this flag was again used as the model for the flag of the United Provinces of Central America, a confederation of the current Central American states of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica, which existed from 1823 to 1838. After the dissolution of the Union, the five countries became independent, but even today all of these states except Costa Rica use flags of blue-white-blue stripes (the Costa Rican flag has a red stripe superimposed on the white one, added to incorporate all the colors of the French flag). The Argentine flag also inspired the flags of Uruguay and Paraguay.\n\nLyrics by Luigi Illica and Héctor Cipriano Quesada, music by Héctor Panizza, it is sung during flag raising ceremonies.\n\nAs Flag Day is celebrated on June 20, the following pledge is recited to students nationwide on this day by their respective school principals or grade level advisers. In large towns where students are gathered en masse, the pledge is taken by the local town or city executive, preceded by words of advice and honor to the memory of its creator, Manuel Belgrano, using the following or similar formulas:\n\nVersions of this include references to Belgrano and to all who fought for the country during the Argentine War of Independence and other wars that followed.\n\nThe \"Glorious Revielle\" may be sounded by a military band or a marching band at this point when available, and confetti may be or may not be showered on the students.\n\nIn the Armed Forces of the Argentine Republic and civil uniformed services the pledge is similar but with a different formula and response of \"¡Si, juro!\" (\"Yes, we pledge!\")\n\nIf in the Argentine Federal Police the words \"y su Constitution Nacional\" (and its Constitution) may be inserted.\n\n"}
{"id": "41336677", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41336677", "title": "Four Seas", "text": "Four Seas\n\nThe Four Seas () were four bodies of water that metaphorically made up the boundaries of ancient China. There is a sea for each for the four cardinal directions. The West Sea is Qinghai Lake, the East Sea is the East China Sea, the North Sea is Lake Baikal, and the South Sea is the South China Sea. Two of the seas were symbolic until they were tied to genuine locations during the Han Dynasty's wars with the Xiongnu. The lands \"within the Four Seas\", a literary name for China, are alluded to in Chinese literature and poetry.\n\nThe original Four Seas were a metaphor for the borders of pre-Han dynasty China. Only two of the Four Seas were tied to real locations, the East Sea with the East China Sea and the South Sea with the South China Sea. During the Han dynasty, wars with the Xiongnu brought them north to Lake Baikal. They recorded that the lake was a \"huge sea\" (hanhai) and designated it the mythical North Sea. They also encountered Qinghai Lake, which they called the West Sea, and the lakes Lop Nur and Bostang in Xinjiang. The Han dynasty expanded beyond the traditional West Sea and reached Lake Balkash, the westernmost boundary of the empire and the new West Sea of the dynasty. Expeditions were sent to explore the Persian Gulf, but went no further. The military expansion of the dynasty ended in 36 BC after the Battle of Zhizhi.\n\nChinese writers and artists often alluded to the Four Seas. Jia Yi, in an essay that summarized the collapse of Qin dynasty, wrote that while the state of Qin has succeeded in \"pocketing all within the Four Seas, and swallowing up everything in all Eight Directions\", its ruler \"lacked humaneness and rightness; because preserving power differs fundamentally from seizing power\". The metaphor is also referenced in the Chinese adage \"we are all brothers of the Four Seas\", a proverb with utopian undercurrents. The lyrics of a popular Han Dynasty folk song extol that \"within the Four Seas, we are all brothers, and none be taken as strangers!\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2489148", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2489148", "title": "Illyricum (Roman province)", "text": "Illyricum (Roman province)\n\nIllyricum was a Roman province that existed from 27 BC to sometime during the reign of Vespasian (69–79 AD). The province comprised Illyria/Dalmatia and Pannonia. Illyria included the area along the east coast of the Adriatic Sea and its inland mountains. With the creation of this province it came to be called Dalmatia. It was in the south, while Pannonia was in the north. Illyria/Dalmatia stretched from the River Drin (in modern northern Albania) to Istria (Croatia) and the River Sava in the north. The area roughly corresponded to modern northern Albania, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina and coastal Croatia. Pannonia was the plain which lies to its north, from the mountains of Illyria/Dalmatia to the westward bend of the River Danube, and included modern Vojvodina (in modern northern Serbia), northern Croatia and western Hungary. As the province developed, Salona (near modern Split, Croatia) became its capital.\n\nIllyricum is a Latin term derived from Greek \"Illyria\" (Ἰλλυρία) and \"Illyris\" (Ἰλλυρίς). A distinction was also made between \"Illyris Barbara\" or \"Romana\", which comprised the Adriatic coast down to today's northern Albania, and \"Illyris Greaca\", which was the rest of Albania, later called Epirus Nova. This latter area derived its name from the fact that, being close to Greece, it was influenced by the Greeks. It was part of the Roman province of Macedonia.\n\nIllyria stretched from the River Drilon (Drin) in modern northern Albania to Istria (in modern Croatia and Slovenia) and the River Savus (Sava) in the north. It comprised the coastal plain, the mountains of the Dinaric Alps which stretch along the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea for 645 kilometres (401 miles) with a width of about 150 kilometres) and, in the north-west, the Istrian Peninsula. There were numerous islands off the coast, but they lacked drinking water. The mountains were cultivated towards the coast, but for the most they were barren. Lack of water and poor or arid soil made much of Illyria poor agricultural area and this gave rise to piracy. The interior of the southern part of Illyricum (central and southern Albania) was more fertile. Illyria was inhabited by dozens of independent tribes and tribal groupings. Most of them were labelled as Illyrians. In the north there were also Celtic tribes. The Pannonian (or Carpathian) plain in the north was more fertile. Its tribes were labelled as Pannonian. Archaeological finds and toponyms show that the Pannonians differed culturally form the Illyrians and the eastern Celts who lived to their west, in what is now Austria. They were later Celticised following a Celtic invasion of the northern part of the region at the beginning of the 4th century BC. Some tribes in the area (the Eravisci, Scordisci Cotini, Boii, and Anartii) were Celtic. The Pannonians also had cultural similarities with the Illyrians. Iron mining and production was an important part of their economy in the pre-Roman days.\n\nThe Romans fought three Illyrian wars between 229 BC and 168 BC. The First Illyrian War (229–28 BC) broke out due to concerns about attacks on the ships of Rome's Italian allies in the Adriatic Sea by Illyrian pirates and the increased power of the Ardiaei (an Illyrian tribe in today's Montenegro and northern Albania). With a powerful fleet The Ardiaei had invaded the Greek cities of Epidamnos (modern Durrës, Albania) Pharos (Stari Grad, Croatia), the island of Corfu and attacked Elis and Messenia in the Peloponnese and Phoenice in Epirus, whose trade with Italy was thriving. Numerous attacks on Italian ships prompted Rome to intervene. The Roman freed the Greek cities and attacked the Ardiaei. Peace terms were agreed. In 220 BC the Ardiaei carried out attacks on the Greek coast in the west, south and southeast. They then attacked Roman allies in southern Illyria. This led to the Second Illyrian War (219–18 BC), which Rome won. In 168 BC, during the Third Macedonian War (171–168 BC) between Rome and the Kingdom of Macedon, the Ardiaei joined the fight against the Romans, but they were quickly defeated (Third Illyrian War, 168 BC). The Romans imposed a tribute which was half the amount they had been paying in taxes to their king (who was deposed) on the cities which had fought them and five neighbouring tribes which also had fought them. The cities and a tribe which had sided with the Romans were exempted from this tribute. The territory of the Ardaei and the neighbouring tribes was declared free and was divided into three cantons. Each was headed by its own council.\n\nWe only have limited and scattered information about the subsequent Roman involvement in Illyria for the next 120 years. It seems that the attention of the Romans shifted further north, to today's Dalmatia (much of the coastal part of Croatia). Most of what we know is through the work of Appian.\n\nIn 156 BC the Dalmatae made an attack of the Illyrian subjects of Rome (it is not clear what Appian meant by this) and refused to see Roman ambassadors. The consul Gaius Marcius Figulus undertook a campaign against them. While he was preparing his camp the Dalmatae overpowered his guards and drove him out of the camp. He fled through the plain as far as the river Naro. He then hoped to catch the Dalmatae unawares as they went back home for the winter, but they had assembled because they had heard of his arrival. Still, he drove them into the city of Delminium. He could not attack this strongly fortified town. Thus he attacked other towns which were partly deserted because of the Dalmatae concentrating their forces at Delminium. He then returned to Delminium and catapulted flaming projectiles. The greater part of the town was burned. Livy's Periochae recorded the campaign of Gaius Marcius Figulus and noted that in the next year, 155 BC, the consul Cornelius Nasica subdued the Dalmatae.\n\nIn 135 BC two Illyrian tribes, the Ardiaei and the Palarii, made a raid on Roman Illyria while the Romans were busy with the Numantine War in Hispania and the First Servile War in Sicily. The Romans sent ambassadors, but they refused to negotiate. The Romans levied an army of 10,000 infantry and 600 cavalry. The Illyrians sent ambassadors to plea for pardon. Rome asked for indemnities for the people who had been attacked. Since the Illyrians were slow to respond the consul Servius Fulvius Flaccus marched against them. According to Appian this was only a minor expedition. It is likely that by Roman Illyria Appian meant four coastal towns which had a large Roman population.\n\nAccording to Appian in 129 BC the consul Gaius Sempronius Tuditanus and Tiberius Pandusa waged a war with the Iapydes who lived on the Alps (in the north of Illyria), and seemed to have subjugated them. However, according to Livy, Sempronius Tuditanus was at first unsuccessful, \"but the defeat was compensated by a victory won through the qualities of Decimus Junius Brutus (the man who had subdued Lusitania).\" Tuditanus was granted a triumph. He immortalized his victories with a dedication to the river god Timavus in Aquileia which bore a victory inscription in Saturnian verse, two fragments of which were found in 1906.\n\nIn a passage Appian wrote that in 119 BC the consul Lucius Caecilius Metellus Dalmaticus waged war against the Dalmatae even though they had not done anything wrong because he wanted a triumph. They received him as a friend and he wintered among them at the town of Salona. He returned to Rome and was awarded a triumph. In another passage he noted \"Lucius Cotta (the other consul for that year) and Caecilius Metellus seemed to have subjugated the Segestani. He also noted that both the Iapydes and the Segestani revolted again shortly afterward. Caecilius Metellus was given the agnomen Dalmanticus,\n\nIn 115 BC the consul Marcus Aemilius Scaurus, conducted operations in Gallia Cisalpina against the Ligures in the west and against the Carni and Taurisci (two Gallic tribes which lived in today's Slovenia) in the east.\n\nIn 113 BC the consul Gnaeus Papirius Carbo was sent to face an invasion by the Cimbri (a Germanic tribe) which had entered into Illyricum and then into Noricum. He was defeated at the Battle of Noreia in Noricum.\n\nIn 78–76 BC a certain Gaius Cosconius was sent into Illyricum as proconsul. He fought there for two years, reduced a great part of Dalmatia and seized Salona (near today's Solin, near Split, Croatia), one of the major towns in Dalmatia. Later the Roman settlement of Colonia Martia Iulia Salona was founded, probably after the Roman civil wars.\n\nIn 59 BC the \"Lex Vatinia\" assigned to the consul Julius Caesar the proconsulship of Gallia Cisalpina (in northern Italy) and Illyricum and the command of three legions based at Aquileia. When the proconsul Gallia Narbonensis died the senate also gave him the proconsulship of that province and the command on a legion which was stationed there, also for five years. Caesar took on his proconsulships in 58 BC. Only Gallia Narbonensis was a province in the sense of a formal administrative unit. The other two were provinces in the sense of areas of military command which were assigned to high military commanders in areas where there were rebellions or threats of attacks. In the past Liguria (which often rebelled), Bruttium (today's Calabria, where there was a chance of unrest) and Gallia Cisalpina (in case of rebellions or possible invasions) had been assigned as provinces in this sense. Aquileia was a Roman town in north-eastern Italy which was founded in 180/181 BC as an outpost to defend northern Italy against hostile and warlike peoples to the east: the Carni (Gauls who lived on the mountains of Noricum), the Taurisci (a federation of Gallic tribes which lived in today's Carniola, northern Slovenia), the Histri (a Venetic tribe, with ties with Illyrians which lived in the Istrian peninsula), and the Iapydes (who lived east of Istrian Peninsula and inland from the Liburnians; the latter lived on a stretch of the Adriatic coast south of the Istrian peninsula and between the rivers Arsia (Raša) and Titius (Krka). The Carni settled in their area around 186 BC, invaded the plain on north-eastern Italy and founded the fortified town of Akileja. The Romans forced the Carni back to the mountains. They destroyed their settlement and founded Aquileia nearby, which was named after Akileja. It was also about 6 km from where an estimated 12,000 Taurisci had tried to settle in 183 BC. For the foundation of Aquileia 3,000 families were settled there. In 169 BC 1,500 more families were settled there. This settlement was grown into a sizable town and three legions were stationed there because of its strategic importance for the defence of northern Italy.\n\nThe fact that Cisalpine Gaul and Illyricum were the areas of command initially assigned to Caesar could indicate that Caesar had an eye on Illyricum to attain military glory with which he could bolster his political clout in Rome. Burebista had led the Dacians from what is today's Romania to the conquest of the Hungarian Plain west of the River Danube and close to Illyricum and Italy. However, Burebista stopped, returned to Transylvania and turned his attention eastwards. Caesar's attention turned to troubles in Gaul and then he embarked on his Gallic Wars (58–50 BC). After the defeat of the Belgae of northern Gaul in 57 BC Caesar thought that Gaul was at peace and went to Illyricum to visit the country and to acquaint himself with it. However, war broke out in Gaul again and he went back there. When he went to Gallia Cisalpina in 54 BC to winter there he heard that the Illyrian tribe of the Pirustae raided nearby territories. He went to Illyricum and levied troops from Illyrian peoples. The Pirustae claimed that none of the raids were due to public decisions and offered compensation. Caesar asked for hostages and said that if they were not handed over he would wage war. The Pirustae complied and Caesar appointed arbitrators to assess the damages done to the other peoples and set a penalty. He returned to Italy and then went to Gaul.\n\nAppian wrote that while Caesar was in Gaul the Dalmatae seized Promona from the Liburnians, who appealed to Caesar. The Dalmatae refused his request to leave the city and he sent a strong detachment. However, it was routed. Caesar did not pursue the matter further because he was occupied with his civil war. This suggests that this event occurred in late 50 BC, just before the beginning of this war.\n\nIn January 49 BC Caesar started a civil war against the forces of the senate led by Pompey. Pompey fled to Greece to gather forces to fight the war. He controlled the Roman navy. Still, in 48 BC Caesar managed to sail his troops across the Adriatic Sea and land at Palaeste (Palasë, southern Albania). Marcus Octavius, one of Pompey's admirals, went to Salona (Solin, near Split, Croatia) with his fleet. He persuaded the people of the island of Issa (Vis, Croatia) to defect to him. He failed to persuade the Romans in Salona and surrounded it with five camps to besiege it. The town was short of grain and sent envoys to Caesar to ask for help. As the siege continued the inhabitants stormed the nearest camp. Then they seized the other four and killed many of the enemy. Octavius was forced to withdraw to his ships and as the winter was approaching he sailed back to Dyrrachium (Durrës, Albania) to rejoin Pompey.\n\nIn the summer 48 BC Caesar sent Quintus Cornificius to Illyricum as a quaestor. This region had been quiet. However, now the Romans in the local towns supported Caesar while the natives supported Pompey. Caesar wrote that the area was quite poor and could barely support an army. Moreover, it was exhausted due to the fighting in the Battle of Dyrrachium between Caesar and Pompey in the south of the region (in July 48 BC) and due to rebellions. Cornificius defended Illyria and recovered it for Caesar. He stormed several mountain strongholds which were used for carrying out raids. When Marcus Octavius took refuge on the Illyrian coast after the Battle of Pharsalus (in Greece, where Caesar defeated Pompey in August 48 BC), Cornificius, with the help of the people of Iadera (Zadar (Croatia) who were loyal to Caesar, scattered his ships and added those he captured to those of his Illyrian allies, thus assembling a small fleet. Since the many Pompeian soldiers had taken refuge in Illyricum after the mentioned battle, Caesar ordered Aulus Gabinius to go to Illyricum with his force, join Cornificius and repulse any enemy operations in the region. If larger forces were needed for this, he was to go to Greece, where continued resistance was to be expected. Gabinius marched in the winter. He did not get supplies for his army because the locals were hostile and because storms in the Adriatic Sea held back supply ships. Gabinius had to storm towns and strongholds in adverse weather and suffered reverses. He had to retreat to Salona, on the coast, which had many Roman inhabitants. On his way he was attacked and routed, losing 2,000 soldiers. He went to Salona with the remnants of his force. He fell ill and died a few months later. Appian wrote that Aulus Gabinius led fifteen cohorts (which would amount to about 7,800 soldiers) and 3,000 cavalry and that, again, being busy with the civil war, Caesar did not pursue the matter further.\n\nMarcus Octavius sought to take advantage of this to seize Illyria. Cornificius asked Publius Vatinius, who was in Brundisium (Brindisi, southern Italy), to come to his aid and informed him that Octavius was making alliances with the locals and attacking Caesarian garrisons, sometimes with his fleet and sometimes with land forces, using native troops—the Caesarians were Caesar's supporters. Vatinius asked a Caesarian lieutenant in Greece to send him a fleet, but this was taking too long. He armed some civilian ships whose size was poorly suited for fighting and added them to the few warships he had and left for Illyria. He did not pursue Octavius so as not to be delayed. Instead, he recovered some coastal towns which had sided with Octavius and by-passed others, proceeding as quickly as he could. In this way he managed to force Octavius to abandon his attack on Epidaurus (Epidaurum in Latin, modern Cavtat, near Dubrovnik, Croatia) with his approach. Octavius thought that his fleet was superior to the small ships of Vatinius and sailed to the island of Tauris. Vatinius pursued him without knowing that he had gone to that island. While the sea was rough he was caught unawares when the fleet of Octavius appeared ready for battle and was superior in formation. Vatinius decided to try his luck and attacked first, charging Octavius’ flagship with one of his warships. The crush was hard and the ram of the latter was smashed away. The battle was fought at close range in narrow sea. Vatinius had the better and at nightfall the remnants of the enemy fleet fled. The next day Vatinius refitted his ships and 85 captured ships and the day after that he set off for the island of Issa (Vis, Croatia), thinking that Octavius had retreated there. When he got there the islanders surrendered and told him that Octavius had left for Sicily. Having cleared the Adriatic Sea, he returned to Brundisium.\n\nIn 45 BC Caesar was planning a war against Parthia. The Illyrians, feared punishment again (this time for routing Aulus Gabinius) because Caesar was going to cross the south of their land to reach Parthia. They sent envoys to Rome to ask Caesar for an alliance. Caesar replied that he could not make friends because of what they had done, but that he would grant pardon if they paid a tribute and handed over hostages. They agreed and Publius Vatinius was sent to impose a light tribute and receive the hostages with three legions and a large cavalry unit. After the murder of Caesar in 44 BC and the ensuing instability in Rome, the Illyrians no longer feared Roman power. They ignored Vatinius and when he tried to use force they routed five cohorts led by Baebius, one of his lieutenants, who also died. Vatinius fled to Dyrrhachium (Durrës, Albania). Once more Caesar did not pursue the matter further. In Appian's opinion, Caesar had put off dealing with the Illyrians resolutely for fourteen years because of his Gallic Wars, his civil war and his planned war with Parthia even though he had given the command over Illyria as well as the two Gauls for ten years, and despite having wintered there. This was even regardless of the fact that at times the Illyrians plundered north-eastern Italy.\n\nThe assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC led to a conflict between the leaders of the plot murder him, Marcus Junius Brutus, and Gaius Cassius Longinus, and the Caesarians led by the Second Triumvirate which took charge of Rome. This led to the Liberator's Civil War (43–42 BC). Before this civil war Brutus and Cassius fled to the east. They had been assigned the Roman provinces of Macedonia (Greece) and Syria respectively by Caesar. However, the Caesarians had the two provinces reassigned to Gaius Antonius (the brother of Mark Antony) and Publius Cornelius Dolabella respectively. They were Caesarians. Brutus and Cassius were given Creta et Cyrenaica instead. They were unhappy with being given this small province and prepared to invade Macedonia and Syria. However, the senate then voted to restore the two provinces to them. Brutus was also assigned Illyria. He arrived in Macedonia when Gaius Antonius had just arrived there to take up his propraetorship which had been assigned to him prior to the change made by the senate. His predecessor, Quintus Hortenius, joined Brutus. Vatinius marched on Dyrrachium and seized it before Brutus got there. However, the soldiers of his three legions (minus the lost cohorts), who disliked him, defected to Brutus, who then went on to engage Gaius Antonius who was in Apollonia (near Fier, Albania). He won over the troops of Antonius (his seven cohorts and a legion under his lieutenant, Lucius Piso) as well.\n\nAncient historians who wrote about this period often used the terms Dalmatians and Dalmatia in a different way from their previous usage. Here these terms did not necessarily refer to the Dalmatae tribe and its territory. It was usually used as a new and wider term to indicate the region of Illyria after it was conquered by Octavian. Octavian conquered southern Pannonia (a plain north of Illyria) as well as Illyria. When the two areas became a Roman province they were given the name Illyricum. Therefore, Illyricum indicated a wider area than previously. The Romans started to use the name Dalmatia to indicate the area formerly called Illyria to distinguish it from Pannonia. Ancient historians used this terminology for the period of the campaigns of Octavian in this area in 33–35 BC as well.\n\nCaesar's Civil War, the Liberators' Civil War and the resistance against the second triumvirate which Sextus Pompey (the son of Pompey the Great) conducted from Sicily with a powerful fleet (the Sicilian Revolt, 44–36 BC) caused instability in Illyria, neighbouring north-eastern Italy and the Adriatic Sea. The Iapydes carried out raids on north-eastern Italy. There was also a problem with piracy. After these conflicts ended Octavian undertook a series of campaigns in Illyricum. Velleius Paterculus wrote that just before the Sicilian Revolt Octavian made frequent expeditions in \"Illyricum and Dalmatia\" in order not to keep his troops idle and to battle-harden them. However, it is likely that these campaigns were also linked to the instability of the region. Cassius Dio noted in passim that in 39 BC Gaius Asinius Pollio suppressed a rebellion of the Parthini after a few battles.\n\nIn 35 BC Octavian campaigned against the Iapydes who had carried out raids against Aquileia, plundered Tergestus (Trieste) and had destroyed Pola (Pula) in the previous year. He marched along a steep and rugged road. The Iapydes hid in the woods and ambushed him. However, Octavian had sent contingents to occupy the ridges on both sides of the road. These descended on them and defeated them. They then abandoned the town of Terponus and fled to the thickets. Octavian seized the city, but did not burn it, hoping that they would surrender, which they did. He then advanced on Metulus (near Ogulin), which was the main town of the Iapydes. It was defended by 3,000 men who defeated the Romans who surrounded the walls. Octavian began a full siege. When its battered walls begun to crumble the Metulians built another one inside. The Romans burnt the abandoned wall and built a mound by the second one and threw four bridges on top of it. Octavian ordered some if his men to go to the back of the town to divert attention. The enemy destroyed three of the bridges. Since his soldiers panicked, Octavian crossed the bridge together with Agrippa and Hiero, two of his lieutenants, and one of his bodyguards. The soldiers followed suit. The bridge fell under their weight. Octavian was injured in the right leg and in both arms. He had more bridges built. This determination discouraged the Metulians, who surrendered. The next day they sent messengers who offered to give fifty hostages and promised to receive a garrison and to assign to the Romans the highest hills while they would occupy the lower ones. When the garrison entered and ordered them to lay down their arms they shut their wives and children in their council chamber and placed guards with orders to set fire to the building if they lost the fight they decided to undertake. They attacked from the lower positions and they were routed. The guards set fire to the council chamber. Many of the women killed themselves and their children while others jumped into the fire holding their children. The city burned completely. The rest of the Iapydes surrendered and came under Roman subjection for the first time. Octavian left and the Poseni rebelled. Marcus Helvius was sent against them. He conquered them, executed the leaders of the revolt and sold the rest into slavery.\n\nOctavian marched on the Segestani, a Pannonian tribe which had been defeated by the Romans twice but were not asked for hostages and rebelled. He advanced against them through Pannonian territory which was not under the subjection of the Romans. The enemy took to the woods and ambushed the stragglers of the army. Octavian spared the fields hoping for a voluntary surrender. Since this did not happen he ravaged the country for eight days until he reached their town, Segesta, on the River Sava. It was strongly protected by the river and a ditch. Octavian wanted to use it as a base for a campaign against the Dacians and the Bastarnae on the other side of the River Danube. Burebista had previously led them in an invasion across the Danube but then returned homeland (Dacia, in today's Romania) and campaigned to its east. Octavian must have thought that there was a danger of another invasion which would destabilise the area. Alternatively, they might have been launching raids across the river. Octavian built a fleet on the Sava to bring provisions to the Danube. When he approached the city he told the Segestani envoys that he wanted a garrison in the town and as much food as they could supply. The leaders acquiesced. The people were angry but consented to giving hostages from the notable families. When the troops came they shut the city gates and manned the walls. Augustus built a bridge over the river and besieged the town. He ambushed some Pannonians who were coming to its aid, killing some of them and putting the rest to flight. The siege lasted thirty days. Augustus only imposed a fine. He placed a garrison of twenty-five cohorts (roughly two and a half legions) and returned to Rome, intending to return in the spring. Later, as a Roman town, Segesta was called Siscia. It is now modern Sisak in Croatia.\n\nCassius Dio wrote that after the fall of this city the rest of Pannonia surrendered. After this Octavian left Fufius Geminus there with a small force and returned to Rome. He set out to lead an expedition into Britain and had already reached Gaul in the winter of 34 BC when some of the newly conquered peoples in Pannonia and the Dalmatians rose in revolt. Appian wrote that there was a rumour that the garrison at Segesta had been massacred and Augustus made his way back. The rumour was exaggerated. There had been an uprising and the Romans had lost many men, but the next day they suppressed the rebellion. Octavian turned on the Dalmatians instead. They had been in arms since the rout of the troops of Aulus Gabinius in 48 BC. When he marched on them they formed a federation. They had up to 12,000 troops led by Versus, who had seized Promona (south of modern Knin, Croatia) from the Liburnians) and fortified it even though it was a tough mountain stronghold. Versus placed the bulk of his forces in the city and distributed the rest on the nearby hills to obstruct the Roman advance. Octavian begun to build a wall in the plain around the town and two hills held by the enemy as a cover for contingents which were heading to the highest hills through their woods. They overpowered the guards at night and at dawn Octavian attacked the city with the bulk of his army. He sent another force to reinforce the occupied heights. The enemy thought that they were attacked from all sides. Those on the hills were afraid that they would be cut off from the water supplies and fled to the town. Octavian continued to build the wall, which reached a length of seven kilometres. Testimus, another Dalmatian commander, brought a relief army. Octavian drove him back to the mountains. He seized Promona before the circumvallation was finished. A small force made a sortie. The Romans repulsed it, pursued it and entered the town with it. The enemy took refuge in the citadel. On the fourth night they attacked a Roman cohort which was keeping watch, putting it to flight. However, the attack was repulsed and the next day the city surrendered. The cohort which had fled was punished by decimation. The spared men were forced to subsist on barley instead of wheat for that summer. Testimus disbanded his troops and told them to scatter. The Romans did not pursue them. Cassius Dio wrote that Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa had conducted a campaign against the Dalmatians prior to this campaign.\n\nStill in 34 BC, the Romans seized the town of Sunodium at the edge of the forest in which the army of Aulus Gabinius had been entrapped by the Dalmatians in a long and deep gorge between two mountains. After Octavian had burned Sunodium the Dalmatians laid an ambush. However, he was protected by soldiers he had sent to the summits of the mountains to follow him on either side while he passed through the gorge. He cut down trees and captured and burned all the towns he found on his way. In 33 BC he besieged the city of Setovia. An enemy force came to its assistance, but he prevented it from entering the place. Octavian was struck by a stone on the knee and was confined for several days. He returned to Rome to take up his consulship and got Titus Statilius to continue the siege. He then went back to Dalmatia. The Dalmatians were cut off from foreign supplies and were hungry. They met Octavian while he was on his way and surrendered. He demanded 700 of their children as hostages, and the standards of the Roman legions which had been taken from Aulus Gabinius when he was routed. They complied and also promised to pay the tribute which had been in arrears since the time of Julius Caesar. Octavian then moved on the Derbani, who also sued for peace, gave hostages, and promised to pay the tribute in arrears. Other tribes did the same on his approach. He could not reach some tribes due to sickness. These gave no hostages and made no treaties. Appian wrote that it seemed that they were subjugated later and that Octavian subdued the whole Illyrian country, including both the tribes which had rebelled and those which had never before been under Roman rule. It is likely that Appian was referring to just Illyria/Dalmatia, rather or the whole of that was to become the province of Illyricum. With regard to Pannonia, some historians think that Octavian probably conquered the southern part of Pannonia and that the northern part was conquered in the Pannonian War (see below).\n\nAppian also wrote that Octavian overcame the Oxyaei, the Perthoneatae, the Bathiatae, the Taulantii, the Cambaei, the Cinambri, the Meromenni, and the Pyrissaei, the Docleatae, the Carui, the Interphrurini, the Naresii, the Glintidiones, the Taurisci, the Hippasini and the Bessi. The Moentini and the Avendeatae, two Iapyde tribes which lived on the Alps, surrendered on Octavian's approach. He took the city of the Arrepini, the largest and most warlike of the Iapydes, who had fled to the woods. He did not burn it hoping that they would surrender, which they did. He also seized the islands of Melite (Mljet) and Melaina Corcyra (Korčula) and destroyed its settlements because its inhabitants practiced piracy. He executed the young men and sold the rest into slavery. He deprived the Liburnians of their ships because they practiced piracy.\n\nAfter his campaigns in Illyricum, Octavian fought a war against Marc Antony and Cleopatra VII of Egypt in 31/30 BC. He won and became the sole ruler of Rome. After that he spent a few years laying the foundations for his personal rule. Illyricum became a province as a formal administrative unit in 27 BC, with the first settlement with the Roman senate. This formalised his personal rule. The senate bestowed of the honorary title of Augustus on him. He became the first Roman emperor. Historians use the name Augustus for this period. The settlement also divided the provinces of the empire into senatorial and imperial provinces. The former were under the authority of the senate, which chose their governors form among the senators. The latter were under Augustus, who appointed their governors. Augustus held the frontier provinces, which hosted the bulk of the Roman troops. Initially Illyricum was a senatorial propreatorial province. Rebellions in the province showed the necessity of maintaining a strong force there and in 11 BC it became an imperial province under the governorship of Publius Cornelius Dolabella.\n\nThe administrative organisation of Illyricum was carried out late in the reign of Augustus (27 BC – 14 AD) and early in the reign of Tiberius (14–37 AD). Tiberius made initial arrangements in the last weeks of the Batonian war (see below). This work was interrupted by a mutiny of the Roman troops in 14 AD, but was then resumed. We have a fairly detailed picture of the administrative arrangements of Illyricum through Pliny the Elder. The coastal area was subdivided into three regions called \"conventus juridicus\" which were named after the towns of Scardona (Skradin), Salona and Narona (near Metković). The \"conventus Salonitanus\" was subdivided into 5 \"civitates\" and 927 decuriae. The \"conventus Naronitianus\" was subdivided into 13 \"civitates\" and 540 decuriae. The \"conventus Scardonitanus\" was subdivided into 14 \"civitates\". There is no information for its decuriae. In the more urbanised coastal area towns with large Greek-speaking populations and may inhabitants from Italy were organised as \"municipia\" (self-governing towns) or \"coloniae\" (Italian settlements) and had their own council. Some of the local communities enjoyed some privileges and some Librunian ones enjoyed Italian rights. In the less urbanised interior the administration relied exclusively on the \"civitates\". The jurisdiction of the governor of Illyricum was limited to the coastal area. The inland districts had their own governors in the form of the \"praefecti civitatum\" of the \"civitates\". Pannonia was subdivided into 14 civitates. Again, there is no information about the decuriae. It was also a military district under the prefect of Pannonia, who was in charge of the legions stationed there.\n\nDalmatia had considerable strategic and economic importance for the Romans. It possessed a number of important commercial ports along its coastline, and had gold-mines in Dalmatia with an imperial bureau in Salona. Dyrrachium (Durrës, in modern Albania) and Brundisium ( Brindisi, in southern Italy) were the ports used to cross the Adriatic Sea for the journeys from Rome to the eastern Mediterranean and vice versa. Dyrrachium also became the starting point of the Via Egnatia, the Roman road which went to Byzantium in the east, opposite Asia. There were important Roman communities in a number of towns on the central and southern part of the coast of today's Croatia, such as Iader (Zadar), Salona (Solin, on the outskirts of Split), Narona (near Metković), and Epidaurus (Epidaurum in Latin, modern Cavtat, near Dubrovnik). The capital Salona was protected by two military camps at Burnum and Delminium.\n\nFrom 14 BC to 10 BC there was a series of rebellions in southern Pannonia and northern Dalmatia which Roman writers referred to as bellum pannomicum (the Pannonian war). We have very little information about these events. Most of it comes from brief accounts by Cassius Dio and passing references by other authors. We are not told what the causes were either. The Roman sources had little interest in Illyria from the campaigns of Augustus in 35–33 BC to 16 BC. Cassius Dio wrote that in that year the governor of Illyria for 17–16 BC, Publius Silius Nerva, went to fight in the Italian Alps because there were no troops there. Taking advantage of this, some Pannonians and the Noricans entered Istria and pillaged it. Silius Nerva quickly brought the situation under control. At the same time, there was a small rebellion in Dalmatia. The Dentheletae (a Thracian tribe in eastern Moesia), together with the Scordisci (who lived in today's Serbia, at the confluence of the Rivers Savus [Sava], Dravus [Drava] and Danube) attacked the Roman province of Macedonia (Greece). At the same time a civil war broke out in Thrace. Therefore, there was instability on the eastern Alps and in the Balkan Peninsula. In 15 BC the Romans conquered the Scordisci and annexed Noricum. They also conducted other operations further west on the Alps against the Rhaeti and Vindelici. The Roman military operations in Illyricum might have been started by Marcus Vinicius the governor for 14–13 BC. The Pannonian war led to Illyricum being transferred from being a senatorial province to being an imperial province.\n\nVelleius Paterculus wrote that the Pannonian war started by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and Vinicius and that Tiberius ended it. Florus mentioned a victory of Vinicius over the Pannonians living between the rivers Sava and Drava. Cassius Dio noted in two separate passages that a rebellion by the Pannonians in 14 BC was suppressed quickly, and that in late 13 BC Augustus gave Agrippa, his most important ally, supreme command and sent him to Pannonia (this suggests that the problem was serious). Agrippa solved the situation through negotiations and personal influence. After Agrippa's sudden death the Breuci refused to observe the treaty they had made with him. Tiberius was given the command in Pannonia and defeated the Pannonians with the help of the Scordisci, who had been recently conquered by the Romans. Suetonius added that after this Tiberius subjugated the Dalmatians and the Breuci. In 11 BC Tiberius fought and defeated both the Dalmatians and the Pannonians. Later in the year, as already mentioned, Illyricum became an imperial province under the control of Augustus. In the winter 11/10 BC the Dacians crossed the frozen Danube and plundered the Pannonians. Some Dalmatian communities rebelled against the payment of a tribute. Tiberius, who was in Gaul, had to return to confront this. In 10 BC there were repeated uprisings in both Pannonia and Dalmatia which Tiberius suppressed.\n\nCassius Dio referred to all of these conflicts as rebellions. Dzino argues that it is therefore unlikely that they involved any conquests. The relations of the Romans with locals in frontier areas involved alliance treaties and treaties with client states, both of which entailed nominal independence. The breaking of these treaties was considered as a rebellion and as something which had to be suppressed. Augustus in his propagandistic writing stated that under Tiberius’ command Rome extended her sphere to Pannonian peoples where the Roman army had never been before and that Augustus extended the boundaries of Illyricum to the banks of the River Danube. However, Suetonius implied that this extension to the banks of this river occurred only after the Batonian War (see below). It is likely that in the aftermath of the Pannonian war Roman military presence in southern Pannonia increased. Dzino argues that it is likely that the local communities acted as a compact anti-Roman block and that there may have been pro- and anti-Roman factions. Some may have surrendered peacefully and some of them may have been pro-Roman all along. The communities of the region relied on kinship relationships, rather than formal state institutions. This may have led to political competition. Being friendly to the Romans or challenging them could have involved manoeuvres by local elites to strengthen their power-base. Acquiescence or opposition to the Romans could involve often unpredictable contests over political positions locally.\n\nThe Batonian War (bellum batonianum in Latin) was a large scale rebellion which was led Bato the Daesitiate and Bato the Breucian. The Romans named this war after these two leaders with the same name. It lasted four years (6–9 AD). In 6 AD the Romans were preparing to launch a second expedition against the Marcomanni in Germania. This would have involved the legions stationed in Germania and most of the legions stationed in Illyricum. The natives were asked to provide auxiliary troops. When these forces gathered they rebelled under the leadership of Bato the Daesitiate. Cassius Dio described his force as Dalmatian, which suggests that he had men who came from various tribes of Dalmatia. This is a very likely scenario as the native troops would have been recruited from a wide area. A Roman force which was sent against the rebels was defeated. Bato the Breucian, the military leader of the Breuci, the largest tribe in southern Pannonia, marched on Sirmium (Sremska Mitrovica, in today's Serbia). He was defeated by Aulus Caecina Severus, the governor of the neighbouring Roman province of Moesia. Bato the Daesitiate marched on Salona, in Dalmatia, but was defeated by Marcus Valerius Messalla Messallinus, the governor of Illyricum. Bato then went east to join the other Bato and the two of them occupied Mount Alma (Mount Fruška Gora, Serbia, just north of Sirmium). They were defeated by a Thracian cavalry detachment of Rhoemetalces (the king of the Odrysian Kingdom in Thrace) which supported the Romans. The Dalmatians overran the territory of the Roman allies and drew many more tribes into the revolt. Tiberius (the future emperor), who was in charge of the Roman army marched on them. However, they avoided pitched battles and kept moving around, causing great devastation. Facing an enemy with avoided bitched battle and used guerrilla tactics, Tiberius conducted counterinsurgency operations.\n\nAccording to Velleius Paterculus the rebels divided their forces into three parts. One was to invade Italy, which was not far from Nauportus (a Roman fort in today's Slovenia), one had already entered the Roman Province of Macedonia (Greece) and the third fought in their home territories. They executed their plan swiftly. They massacred Roman civilians and a sizable veteran contingent who were helpless in this remote area. They seized Macedonia and the pillaged everywhere. Thus, in this version the rebellion seemed to have a plan and the Dalmatians and the Breuci seemed to have acted in concert from the beginning. In Cassius Dio, instead, Bato the Daesitiate initially had a few men and his success increased his forces. After his failure to take Salona he allied with the other Bato. Tiberius divided the Roman army into several divisions to evade the united forces of the rebels. Outposts were placed to blockade them, to prevent them from breaking through and to disrupt their supplies. The situation in Illyricum, which was next to Italy, created panic in Rome and even Augustus was fearful. Levies were held all over Italy. The veterans were recalled. Rich families were ordered to supply freedmen compulsorily in proportion to their income. Augustus warned that the rebels could reach Rome in ten days if drastic action was not taken.\n\nIn 7 AD Augustus sent Germanicus to Illyricum with a force of freemen and freedmen. Some of the latter were requisitioned form their masters, who were paid a compensation. Velleius Paterculus wrote that the rebels in Pannonia who faced Tiberius were not happy with the size of their forces. They were worn down and brought to the verge of famine (presumably due to ravaging), could not withstand his offensives an avoided pitched battles. They went to the Claudian Mountains (a mountain range in Pannonia, in the Varaždin County in northern Croatia) and took a defensive position in their fortifications. The second rebel force confronted the legions which Caecina Severus and Marcus Plautius Silvanus were bringing to Illyricum (from Moesia and the Roman province of Asia, three and two legions respectively). They surrounded the five legions, their auxiliary troops and the Thracian cavalry and almost inflicted a fatal defeat. The Thracian cavalry was routed and the allied cavalry fled. The legions suffered casualties, but they then rallied and won the day. In Cassius Dio’ version, instead, the two Batos went to wait for the arrival of Caecina Severus. He did not mention Plautius Silvanus. They attacked him unexpectedly when he was encamped near the Volcaean marshes. They were defeated. After this battle the Roman army was divided into detachments to overrun many parts of the country at once. The rebels withdrew to mountain fortresses from which they launched raids whenever they could. Aulus Caecina Severus and Marcus Plautius Silvanus joined Tiberius and a huge army was assembled. As mentioned, they had five legions. Tiberius also had five legions (three in Pannonia and two in Dalmatia). Tiberius decided to send the newly arrived armies back because the army was too large to be manageable. He escorted them with his troops. He then returned to Siscia at the beginning of a very hard winter.\n\nIn 8 BC the Dalmatians and the Pannonians wanted to sue for peace due to famine and disease, but they were prevented from doing so by the rebels, who had no hope of being spared by the Romans and continued to resist. Tiberius had pursued a policy of scorched earth to starve the Pannonians. According to Cassius Dio, Bato the Breucian overthrew Pinnes, the king of the Breuci. He became suspicious of his subject tribes and demanded hostages from the Pannonian garrisons. Bato the Daesitiate defeated him in battle and pinned him in a stronghold. He was handed over to Bato the Daesitiate and he was executed. After this many Pannonians rose in revolt. Marcus Plautius Silvanus conducted a campaign against them, conquered the Breuci and won over other tribes without a battle. Bato the Daesitiate withdrew from Pannonia, occupied the passes leading to Dalmatia and ravaged Dalmatia. In Pannonia there was some brigandage. Velleius Paterculus, wrote that the harsh winter brought rewards because in the following summer all of Pannonia sought peace. The Pannonians laid down their arms at the River Bathinus. Bato was made a prisoner and Pinnes gave himself up.\n\nIn 9 BC the war was restricted to Dalmatia. Velleius Paterculus wrote that Augustus gave the chief command of all the forces to Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. In the summer Lepidus made his way to Tiberius through areas which had not been affected by the war. He was attacked by the locals who had not been weakened by fighting. Lepidus defeated them, ravaged the fields, and burnt houses. He succeeded in reaching Tiberius. This campaign ended the war. Two Dalmatian tribes, the Perustae and Daesitiate, who were almost unconquerable because of their mountain strongholds, the narrow passes in which they lived and their fighting spirit, were almost exterminated. Cassius Dio wrote Germanicus conducted some operations in Dalmatia and seized several towns. Tiberius then spilt the army into three divisions. He sent two of them to subdue areas of Dalmatia and he went in search of Bato the Daesitiate third one. Tiberius chased the fugitive Bato around the country. He finally besieged him at Adetrium, near Salona. This was on a rock and was surrounded by steep ravines. After a long siege he managed to storm the place. Bato promised to surrender if he and his followers would be pardoned. Tiberius agreed. According to Cassius Dio Tiberius asked Bato why his people had rebelled. He replied: \"You Romans are to blame for this; for you send as guardians of your flocks, not dogs or shepherds, but wolves.\" It is uncertain if this quote can be attributed to Bato, however, due to the habit of ancient writers of creating fictitious quotes and attributing them to historical figures.\n\nThe earliest writing which indicates that the province of Illyricum comprised Dalmatia and Pannonia is the mention by Velleius Pareculus of Gaius Vibius Postumus as the military commander of Dalmatia under Germanicus in 9 AD., towards the end of the Batonian War. It seems that officially the province of Illyricum comprised Upper (Superius) Illyricum and Lower (Inferius) Illyricum. A transcript of an inscription of a monument in honour of Publius Cornelius Dolabella at Epidaurum (Cavtat, near Dubrovnik) attests that Dolabella was appointed governor of Illyricum shortly before Augustus’ death and that the statue was erected by the towns of Upper Illyricum, which implies the existence of an Upper and Lower Illyricum. However, no inscriptions attesting a Lower Illyricum have been found as yet. Dalmatia was called Upper Illyricum. Whilst the names Dalmatia and Pannonia were used in common parlance, it seems that Upper Illyricum (Dalmatia) and Lower Illyricum (Pannonia) were the official names of the two regions. The provincial governor resided in Salona in Dalmatia and governed Upper Illyricum. Lower Illyricum was a military district and a military commander was in charge of this area and its three legions and performed administrative functions as something like a deputy governor.\n\nWriting in the winter of AD 57–58, the Apostle Paul refers to Illyricum in his Letter to the Romans as the westernmost point of his missionary travels so far. The letter reflects his intention in due course to travel to Rome.\n\nThe province of Illyricum was eventually dissolved and replaced by two smaller provinces: Dalmatia (the southern area) and Pannonia (the northern and Danubian area). It is unclear when this happened. Kovác noted that an inscription on the base of a statue of Nero erected between 54 and 68 AD attests that it was erected by the veteran of a legion stationed in Pannonia and argues that this is the first epigraphic evidence that a separate Pannonia existed at least since the reign of Nero. However, Šašel-Kos notes that an inscription attests a governor of Illyricum under the reign of Claudius (43–51 AD) and in a military diploma published in the late 1990s, dated July 61 AD, units of auxiliaries from the Pannonian part of the province were mentioned as being stationed in Illyricum. Some other diplomas attest the same. This was during the reign of Nero (51–68 AD). Therefore, Šašel-Kos supports the notion that the province was dissolved during the reign of Vespasian (79–89 AD)\n\nIn 293 AD the emperor Diocletian radically reformed the administrative structure of the Roman empire. He created the tetrarchy (rule by four). This was a co-emperorship with two senior emperors (Augusti), Diocletian and Maximian, and two junior emperors (Caesars), Constantius Chlorus and Galerius. The empire was subdivided into four praetorian prefectures. Each was headed by one of two co-emperors or one of two Caesars (thus, a total of two co-emperors and two Caesars). Diocletian and Maximian were also in overall charge of the eastern and the western part of the empire respectively. The number of provinces was doubled and they were grouped into fifteen dioceses which were under the praetorian prefectures. The praetorian prefectures were Galliae, Italia et Africa, Oriens and Illyricum. Thus, Illyricum became a praetorian prefecture. It included the dioceses of Pannonia, (western Hungary, a strip of land in northern Croatia along the River Sava, and Vojvodina, in northern Serbia), Dacia (modern western, central and northern Bulgaria, central and southern Serbia, Montenegro, northern Albania and the north of the Republic of Macedonia) and Macedonia (Greece). Hence, Illyricum came to cover the whole of the Balkan Peninsula, including Greece, except for the diocese of Thrace (in modern south-eastern Bulgaria, north-eastern Greece and European Turkey). It also included Crete and the Greek islands in the north and the southwest of the Aegean Sea, and Noricum. The diocese of Pannonia was subdivided into the provinces of Pannonia Prima, Secunda, Savia and Veleria (the north, southeast, southwest and west of Pannonia respectively), Dalmatia, Noricum Ripense (\"along the river\", the northern part, which was crossed by the river Danube) and Noricum Mediterraneum (the southern part). The capital of the praetorian prefecture of Illyricum was Sirmium (modern Sremska Mitrovica, northern Serbia). Under the tetrarchy it was headed by Galerius. The praetorian prefecture survived until the early 7th century.\n\nPannonia was a very valuable source of military manpower. From the 3rd to the 6th century some of the most useful troops were recruited from Pannonia, Dalmatia, Moesia and Roman Thrace. This is not entirely surprising. Pannonia and the other areas along the River Danube, the frontier of the empire in the Balkan Peninsula, were exposed to attacks on the empire from across this river. Therefore, Pannonia was very important militarily. Pat Southern sees Illyricum as holding the empire together. In the Late Roman Empire, the armies of the praetorian prefecture of Illyricum had a commander in-chief, the \"magister militum per Illyricum\", based at Naissus (Niš, southern Serbia). John Bury wrote that \"The importance of Illyricum did not lie in its revenues, but in its men.\" The region's native peoples, renowned for their military prowess, became important for the Roman army. During the Crisis of the Third Century the emperors Claudius II (reigned 268–270), Quintilius (reigned 270), Aurelian (reigned 270–275) and Probus (reigned 276–282) were born in Sirmium (Sremska Mitrovica, in today's Serbia). They have been dubbed by historians the Pannonian emperors. Diocletian (reigned 284–305) was born in Salona (Solin, Croatia). Constantine the Great and Constantius III (421AD ) were born in Naissus. His father, Constantius Chlorus, was born in Moesia Superior. The Byzantine emperor Anastasius I (reigned 491–518) was born in Dyrrhachium (Durrës, Albania). Justinian I (reigned 527–565) was born in Tauresium, in the province of Dardania in the Diocese of Dacia (20 kilometres [12 miles] southeast of Skopje in today's Republic of Macedonia). Justinian I was the last Latin emperor of this empire. From then on all the emperors were Greek.\n\n\n"}

As a result, these students lose contact with the shared basis of their education as they venture into separate abstract studies. In effect, the communication gap of collegiate students widens as they become saturated with a curriculum of abstractions that relate to a single area of study.\n\nFor instance, a college freshman chooses mathematics as his field of study while another chooses English. As they study, the two students become grossly out of touch as they adapt to new languages which will soon serve as a code in their future careers. The mathematics student becomes consumed by symbols and numbers while the English student immerses himself in a sea of classical literary styles and grammatical mechanics. Consequently, the students soon become ill-equipped to communicate with each other. The mathematics student now becomes \"illiterate\" by standards of the English major and the English major becomes \"innumerate\" by standards of the mathematics major. \n\nBecause knowledge is increasing, some fragmentation of disciplines is inevitable. The problem with fragmentation is that students are forced to live in ignorance of studies outside of their fields.\n\n\"The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution\" by C. P. Snow, 1959\n"}

He emigrated to the colony of Liberia in 1822, where he served as the United States government's agent (de facto governor) for two different terms: one from August 1822 until April 1824, and another from August 1824 until March 1828.\n\nBorn in Champlain, New York in 1794, Ashmun first studied at Middlebury College in Vermont. He spent his senior year at the University of Vermont and was ordained in Maine as a minister.\n\nAshmun married in 1818 and his wife accompanied him to Bangor, Maine, where he took his first position.\n\nAshmun was appointed as the first principal, and one of the first two professors, of the Bangor Theological Seminary in Bangor, Maine. He retained this professorship until 1827, despite leaving the country for a few years while living and working in the new colony of Monrovia, Liberia.\n\nDrawn by other opportunities, Ashmun moved to Washington, DC, where he worked as the editor of an Episcopalian monthly. Interested in the work of the American Colonization Society (ACS), he founded the newspaper \"The African Intelligencer\" and wrote about their mission. His articles about the ACS, which was committed to repatriating free blacks to a colony in Liberia, led to his political appointment as representative of the U.S. government to the colony. At the age of 26, Ashmun was the leader in 1822 of a group of settlers and missionaries to Liberia on the ship \"Elizabeth\". His wife went with him but was among the many settlers who died of malaria in Liberia.\n\nAs United States representative to Liberia as well as agent of the ACS, Ashmun effectively became governor of the colony from 1822 to 1828, from ages 28 to 34. He took a leadership role in what he found to be a demoralized colony and helped build the defenses of Monrovia, as well as developing trade. During his tenure in Liberia, Ashmun increased agricultural production, annexed more lands from neighboring tribes, and exploited commercial opportunities in the interior.\n\nHe helped create a constitution for Liberia that enabled blacks to hold positions in the government. African Americans and their descendants, known as Americo-Liberians, dominated the government into the late 20th century. This was unlike what happened in the early decades of the neighboring British colony of Sierra Leone, which was dominated by whites although also founded for the resettlement of free blacks from Britain and Upper Canada. Ashmun's letters home and his book, \"History of the American Colony in Liberia, 1821–1823\" (1826) constitute the earliest written history of the Liberia colony.\n\nIn ill health in Liberia, Ashmun returned to the United States. He died in New Haven, Connecticut soon after. He was interred in Grove Street Cemetery.\n\n"}

On occasion, they have been admitted and granted a degree, as reported in reliable sources. Animals are often used as a device to clearly demonstrate the lax standards of the awarding institutions. In one case, a cat's degree helped lead to a successful fraud prosecution against the institution that had issued it.\n\nColby Nolan is a housecat who was awarded an MBA in 2004 by Trinity Southern University, a Dallas-based diploma mill, sparking a fraud lawsuit by the Pennsylvania attorney general's office.\n\nColby Nolan lives with a deputy attorney general. In looking to expose Trinity Southern University for fraud, some undercover agents had the then six-year-old Colby Nolan obtain a bachelor's degree in business administration for $299. On the cat's application, the agents claimed that the cat had previously taken courses at a community college, worked at a fast-food restaurant, babysat, and maintained a newspaper route. Then the school informed Colby that, due to the job experience listed on his application, he was eligible for an executive MBA for $100 more. The agents then sent for Colby's transcript, which claimed that he had a GPA of 3.5.\n\nJerry Pappert, Pennsylvania's attorney general, filed a lawsuit against Trinity Southern University upon learning that the cat had received the degree. In the lawsuit, Pappert also told the diploma mill, which had used email spam to sell degrees, to provide restitution to anyone who had ordered a degree from them.\n\nIn December 2004, the Texas attorney general obtained a temporary restraining order under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act against Trinity Southern and its owners, Craig B. and Alton S. Poe. The court also ordered the school's assets frozen. In March 2005, the Poes were assessed penalties of over $100,000 by the court and were ordered not to market or promote fraudulent, substandard degree programs or to represent their university as being accredited or affiliated with legitimate universities. It was reported that the Poes were also associated with Wesleyan International University and Prixo Southern University. Trinity Southern University's website has been offline since 2005.\n\nIn 2009, George, a cat owned by Chris Jackson (presenter of the BBC show \"Inside Out North East & Cumbria\"), was registered with three professional organizations: the British Board of Neuro Linguistic Programming, the United Fellowship of Hypnotherapists, and the Professional Hypnotherapy Practitioner Association, securing George's accreditation as a hypnotherapist.\n\nBen Goldacre, a UK-based physician and science journalist, wrote in 2004 that his cat Henrietta had obtained a diploma in nutrition from the American Association of Nutritional Consultants; Goldacre had been investigating allegations about the qualifications claimed by Gillian McKeith. Goldacre said, \"it’s a particular honour since dear, sweet, little Hettie died about a year ago.\"\n\nIn 1973, the Lakeland, Florida newspaper \"The Ledger\" obtained a high school diploma from \"Washington High Academy\" for Kitty O'Malley, a cat also known as Spanky. While the diploma was deemed insufficient to gain Kitty admission to local colleges, the state attorney general's office planned to investigate the institution.\n\nOn December 10, 1967, \"The Times\" reported that Oliver Greenhalgh had been accepted as a fellow of the English Association of Estate Agents and Valuers, after a payment of eleven guineas (his two references were not verified). Oliver was a cat belonging to Michael Greenhalgh, a cameraman with Television Wales and the West, who was pursuing an investigation of bogus professional associations. \n\nOreo C. Collins (born around 2007) is a tuxedo cat who gained notoriety when she received a diploma from Jefferson High School Online in 2009, although her age was misrepresented in order to qualify.

Katze (\"Zoe the Cat\" in German) was a housecat owned by Steve K. D. Eichel. Around 2001, Eichel was able to obtain several well-known hypnotherapy certifications for his cat. The ease with which Zoe obtained these credentials became the subject of an article by the American Bar Association and a news report by CBS News. The certification of Zoe has been cited in several books and articles on credentialing scams, and has appeared in psychology and forensic curricula. Eichel also served as the consultant to the BBC investigation that ultimately led to the certification of George the cat by various UK hypnosis associations.\n\nIn 2010, Mark Howard, a member of the legal team for the claimants (BSkyB) in \"BSkyB Ltd & Anor v HP Enterprise Services UK Ltd & Anor\" [2010] obtained a degree for his dog Lulu from Concordia College in the US Virgin Islands. Lulu \"graduated\" with higher marks than the defendant's key witness, who the judge found had lied that he had attended classes for his Concordia MBA. In the legal community, the story of the witness' MBA is described as \"infamous\", and a supervisory management cautionary tale.\n\nIn February 2012, in a story on local diploma mills by Houston television station KHOU, the reporters got a high school diploma and official transcript from Lincoln Academy for their photographer's basset hound Molly for $300 after filling out a \"laughable\", \"easy take-home test\". According to a homeschooling advocate, Lincoln Academy and other schools were improperly taking advantage of a Texas law that prohibits discrimination by public colleges and universities against homeschooled students.\n\nThe American University of London offered Pete, a four-year-old male short-haired Lurcher in Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, London, an MBA for £4,500 without requiring any course work. The BBC current affairs program \"Newsnight\" reported in 2013 that the dog, named \"Peter Smith\" on the faked CV for a management consultant, was offered an MBA by the university's Accreditation of Previous Experiential Learning board based on his \"made-up work experience and a fictitious undergraduate degree\" just four days after applying for the course.\n\nIn 1984, \"Time Magazine\" reported that Sassafras, a female poodle belonging to a New York City physician, had received a diploma from the American Association of Nutrition and Dietary Consultants.

Sonny's \"work experience\" included \"significant proctology experience sniffing other dogs' bums\". Ashwood University has since been listed as a Non Accredited Degree Supplier in the states of Michigan, Oregon, and Texas. \n\nIn 2004, the Albany, New York television station WRGB ran a report in which reporter Peter Brancato applied to and received an associate degree from Almeda University on behalf of his dog, Wally. On the application, Brancato listed, \"Plays with the kids every day ... teaches them to interact better with each other ... Teaches them responsibilities like feeding the dog.\" Almeda University granted Wally a \"life experience\" associate degree in \"Childhood Development\". After the report aired, Almeda University protested that Brancato perjured himself by creating a false identity using a fabricated name and date of birth. In a public statement, an Almeda University representative wrote, \"He completed an application that included a background of the following: Eight-years tutoring pre-K children, curriculum design and development, teaching coping skills, and volunteer coaching\". In March 2008, Wally was featured in a Lake Geneva, Wisconsin mayoral campaign political cartoon, with a dialogue bubble reading, \"I graduated with Bill Chesen\", referring to candidate Chesen's Almeda University bachelor's degree.\n\nIn 2017, Mike Daube, a public health expert in Western Australia, reinvented his dog Ollie as Dr. Olivia Doll. He made up credentials including \"past associate of the Shenton Park Institute for Canine Refuge Studies\" (where she was a rescue dog) and submitted her application for posts on the editorial boards of some predatory journals. Several accepted her application, and the Global Journal of Addiction and Rehabilitation Medicine named her associate editor.\n\nIn 2009, Dr. Ben Mays, a veterinarian in Clinton, Arkansas, submitted an application to Belford University on behalf of English bulldog Maxwell Sniffingwell. The application included his work as a reproductive specialist, noting his \"natural ability in theriogenology\" and \"experimental work with felines\" and his understanding of the merits of specialization despite a desire to \"'do them all.'\" His application was accepted upon the $549 payment to the university.\n\n"}

{"id": "1570429", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1570429", "title": "Loneliness", "text": "Loneliness\n\nLoneliness is a complex and usually unpleasant emotional response to isolation. Loneliness typically includes anxious feelings about a lack of connection or communication with other beings, both in the present and extending into the future. As such, loneliness can be felt even when surrounded by other people. The causes of loneliness are varied and include social, mental, emotional, and physical factors.\n\nResearch has shown that loneliness is prevalent throughout society, including people in marriages, relationships, families, veterans, and those with successful careers. It has been a long explored theme in the literature of human beings since classical antiquity. Loneliness has also been described as social pain—a psychological mechanism meant to motivate an individual to seek social connections. Loneliness is often defined in terms of one's connectedness to others, or more specifically as \"the unpleasant experience that occurs when a person's network of social relations is deficient in some important way\".\n\nPeople can experience loneliness for many reasons, and many life events may cause it, such as a lack of friendship relations during childhood and adolescence, or the physical absence of meaningful people around a person. At the same time, loneliness may be a symptom of another social or psychological problem, such as chronic depression.\n\nMany people experience loneliness for the first time when they are left alone as infants. It is also a very common, though normally temporary, consequence of a breakup, divorce, or loss of any important long-term relationship. In these cases, it may stem both from the loss of a specific person and from the withdrawal from social circles caused by the event or the associated sadness.\n\nThe loss of a significant person in one's life will typically initiate a grief response; in this situation, one might feel lonely, even while in the company of others. Loneliness may also occur after the birth of a child (often expressed in postpartum depression), after marriage, or following any other socially disruptive event, such as moving from one's home town into an unfamiliar community, leading to homesickness. Loneliness can occur within unstable marriages or other close relationships of a similar nature, in which feelings present may include anger or resentment, or in which the feeling of love cannot be given or received. Loneliness may represent a dysfunction of communication, and can also result from places with low population densities in which there are comparatively few people to interact with. Loneliness can also be seen as a social phenomenon, capable of spreading like a disease. When one person in a group begins to feel lonely, this feeling can spread to others, increasing everybody's risk for feelings of loneliness. People can feel lonely even when they are surrounded by other people.\n\nA twin study found evidence that genetics account for approximately half of the measurable differences in loneliness among adults, which was similar to the heritability estimates found previously in children. These genes operate in a similar manner in males and females. The study found no common environmental contributions to adult loneliness.\n\nThere is a clear distinction between feeling lonely and being socially isolated (for example, a loner). In particular, one way of thinking about loneliness is as a discrepancy between one's necessary and achieved levels of social interaction, while solitude is simply the lack of contact with people. Loneliness is therefore a subjective experience; if a person thinks they are lonely, then they are lonely. People can be lonely while in solitude, or in the middle of a crowd. What makes a person lonely is the fact that they need more social interaction or a certain type of social interaction that is not currently available. A person can be in the middle of a party and feel lonely due to not talking to enough people. Conversely, one can be alone and not feel lonely; even though there is no one around that person is not lonely because there is no desire for social interaction. There have also been suggestions that each person has their own optimal level of social interaction. If a person gets too little or too much social interaction, this could lead to feelings of loneliness or over-stimulation.\n\nSolitude can have positive effects on individuals. One study found that, although time spent alone tended to depress a person's mood and increase feelings of loneliness, it also helped to improve their cognitive state, such as improving concentration. Furthermore, once the alone time was over, people's moods tended to increase significantly. Solitude is also associated with other positive growth experiences, religious experiences, and identity building such as solitary quests used in rites of passages for adolescents.\n\nLoneliness can also play an important role in the creative process. In some people, temporary or prolonged loneliness can lead to notable artistic and creative expression, for example, as was the case with poets Emily Dickinson and Isabella di Morra, and numerous musicians. This is not to imply that loneliness itself ensures this creativity, rather, it may have an influence on the subject matter of the artist and more likely be present in individuals engaged in creative activities.\n\nThe other important typology of loneliness focuses on the time perspective. In this respect, loneliness can be viewed as either transient or chronic. It has also been referred to as state and trait loneliness.\n\nTransient (state) loneliness is temporary in nature, caused by something in the environment, and is easily relieved. Chronic (trait) loneliness is more permanent, caused by the person, and is not easily relieved. For example, when a person is sick and cannot socialize with friends would be a case of transient loneliness. Once the person got better it would be easy for them to alleviate their loneliness. A person who feels lonely regardless of if they are at a family gathering, with friends, or alone is experiencing chronic loneliness. It does not matter what goes on in the surrounding environment, the experience of loneliness is always there.\n\nThe existentialist school of thought views loneliness as the essence of being human. Each human being comes into the world alone, travels through life as a separate person, and ultimately dies alone. Coping with this, accepting it, and learning how to direct our own lives with some degree of grace and satisfaction is the human condition.\n\nSome philosophers, such as Sartre, believe in an epistemic loneliness in which loneliness is a fundamental part of the human condition because of the paradox between people's consciousness desiring meaning in life and the isolation and nothingness of the universe. Conversely, other existentialist thinkers argue that human beings might be said to actively engage each other and the universe as they communicate and create, and loneliness is merely the feeling of being cut off from this process.\n\nThere are several estimates and indicators of loneliness. It has been estimated that approximately 60 million people in the United States, or 20% of the total population, feel lonely. Another study found that 12% of Americans have no one with whom to spend free time or to discuss important matters. Other research suggests that this rate has been increasing over time. The \"General Social Survey\" found that between 1985 and 2004, the number of people the average American discusses important matters with decreased from three to two. Additionally, the number of Americans with no one to discuss important matters with tripled (though this particular study may be flawed). In the UK research by Age UK shows half a million people more than 60 years old spend each day alone without social interaction and almost half a million more see and speak to no one for 5 or 6 days a week. On the other hand, the \"Community Life Survey, 2016 to 2017\", by the UK's Office for National Statistics, found that young adults in England aged 16 to 24 reported feeling lonely more often than those in older age groups.\n\nLoneliness appears to have intensified in every society in the world as modernization occurs. A certain amount of this loneliness appears to be related to greater migration, smaller household sizes, a larger degree of media consumption (all of which have positive sides as well in the form of more opportunities, more choice in family size, and better access to information), all of which relates to social capital.\n\nWithin developed nations, loneliness has shown the largest increases among two groups: seniors and people living in low-density suburbs. Seniors living in suburban areas are particularly vulnerable, for as they lose the ability to drive, they often become \"stranded\" and find it difficult to maintain interpersonal relationships.\n\nLoneliness is prevalent in vulnerable groups in society. In New Zealand the fourteen surveyed groups with the highest prevalence of loneliness most/all of the time in descending order are: disabled, recent migrants, low income households, unemployed, single parents, rural (rest of South Island), seniors aged 75+, not in the labour force, youth aged 15-24, no qualifications, not housing owner-occupier, not in a family nucleus, Māori, and low personal income.\n\nAmericans seem to report more loneliness than any other country, though this finding may simply be an effect of greater research volume. A 2006 study in the \"American Sociological Review\" found that Americans on average had only two close friends in which to confide, which was down from an average of three in 1985. The percentage of people who noted having no such confidant rose from 10% to almost 25%, and an additional 19% said they had only a single confidant, often their spouse, thus raising the risk of serious loneliness if the relationship ended. The modern office environment has been demonstrated to give rise to loneliness. This can be especially prevalent in individuals prone to social isolation who can interpret the business focus of co-workers for a deliberate ignoring of needs.\n\nWhether a correlation exists between Internet usage and loneliness is a subject of controversy, with some findings showing that Internet users are lonelier and others showing that lonely people who use the Internet to keep in touch with loved ones (especially seniors) report less loneliness, but that those trying to make friends online became lonelier. On the other hand, studies in 2002 and 2010 found that \"Internet use was found to decrease loneliness and depression significantly, while perceived social support and self-esteem increased significantly\" and that the Internet \"has an enabling and empowering role in people's lives, by increasing their sense of freedom and control, which has a positive impact on well-being or happiness.\"\nThe one apparently unequivocal finding of correlation is that long driving commutes correlate with dramatically higher reported feelings of loneliness (as well as other negative health impacts).\n\nLoneliness has been linked with depression, and is thus a risk factor for suicide. Émile Durkheim has described loneliness, specifically the inability or unwillingness to live for others, i.e. for friendships or altruistic ideas, as the main reason for what he called \"egoistic suicide\". In adults, loneliness is a major precipitant of depression and alcoholism. People who are socially isolated may report poor sleep quality, and thus have diminished restorative processes. Loneliness has also been linked with a schizoid character type in which one may see the world differently and experience social alienation, described as \"the self in exile\".\n\nIn children, a lack of social connections is directly linked to several forms of antisocial and self-destructive behavior, most notably hostile and delinquent behavior. In both children and adults, loneliness often has a negative impact on learning and memory. Its disruption of sleep patterns can have a significant impact on the ability to function in everyday life.\n\nResearch from a large-scale study published in the journal Psychological Medicine, showed that \"lonely millennials are more likely to have mental health problems, be out of work and feel pessimistic about their ability to succeed in life than their peers who feel connected to others, regardless of gender or wealth\".\n\nPain, depression, and fatigue function as a symptom cluster and thus may share common risk factors. Two longitudinal studies with different populations demonstrated that loneliness was a risk factor for the development of the pain, depression, and fatigue symptom cluster over time. These data also highlight the health risks of loneliness; pain, depression, and fatigue often accompany serious illness and place people at risk for poor health and mortality.\n\nChronic loneliness can be a serious, life-threatening health condition. It has been found to be associated with an increased risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease. Loneliness shows an increased incidence of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and obesity.\n\nLoneliness is shown to increase the concentration of cortisol levels in the body. Prolonged, high cortisol levels can cause anxiety, depression, digestive problems, heart disease, sleep problems, and weight gain.\n\n″Loneliness has been associated with impaired cellular immunity as reflected in lower natural killer (NK) cell activity and higher antibody titers to the Epstein Barr Virus and human herpes viruses\". Because of impaired cellular immunity, loneliness among young adults shows vaccines, like the flu vaccine, to be less effective. Data from studies on loneliness and HIV positive men suggests loneliness increases disease progression.\n\nThere are a number of potential physiological mechanisms linking loneliness to poor health outcomes. In 2005, results from the American \"Framingham Heart Study\" demonstrated that lonely men had raised levels of Interleukin 6 (IL-6), a blood chemical linked to heart disease. A 2006 study conducted by the \"Center for Cognitive and Social Neuroscience\" at the University of Chicago found loneliness can add thirty points to a blood pressure reading for adults over the age of fifty. Another finding, from a survey conducted by John Cacioppo from the University of Chicago, is that doctors report providing better medical care to patients who have a strong network of family and friends than they do to patients who are alone. Cacioppo states that loneliness impairs cognition and willpower, alters DNA transcription in immune cells, and leads over time to high blood pressure. Lonelier people are more likely to show evidence of viral reactivation than less lonely people. Lonelier people also have stronger inflammatory responses to acute stress compared with less lonely people; inflammation is a well known risk factor for age-related diseases.\n\nWhen someone feels left out of a situation, they feel excluded and one possible side effect is for their body temperature to decrease. When people feel excluded blood vessels at the periphery of the body may narrow, preserving core body heat. This class protective mechanism is known as vasoconstriction.\n\nThere are many different ways used to treat loneliness, social isolation, and clinical depression. The first step that most doctors recommend to patients is therapy. Therapy is a common and effective way of treating loneliness and is often successful. Short-term therapy, the most common form for lonely or depressed patients, typically occurs over a period of ten to twenty weeks. During therapy, emphasis is put on understanding the cause of the problem, reversing the negative thoughts, feelings, and attitudes resulting from the problem, and exploring ways to help the patient feel connected. Some doctors also recommend group therapy as a means to connect with other sufferers and establish a support system. Doctors also frequently prescribe anti-depressants to patients as a stand-alone treatment, or in conjunction with therapy. It may take several attempts before a suitable anti-depressant medication is found.\n\nAlternative approaches to treating depression are suggested by many doctors. These treatments include exercise, dieting, hypnosis, electro-shock therapy, acupuncture, and herbs, amongst others. Many patients find that participating in these activities fully or partially alleviates symptoms related to depression.\nAnother treatment for both loneliness and depression is pet therapy, or animal-assisted therapy, as it is more formally known. Studies and surveys, as well as anecdotal evidence provided by volunteer and community organizations, indicate that the presence of animal companions such as dogs, cats, rabbits, and guinea pigs can ease feelings of depression and loneliness among some sufferers. Beyond the companionship the animal itself provides there may also be increased opportunities for socializing with other pet owners. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention there are a number of other health benefits associated with pet ownership, including lowered blood pressure and decreased levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.\n\nNostalgia has also been found to have a restorative effect, counteracting loneliness by increasing perceived social support.\n\nA 1989 study found that the social aspect of religion had a significant negative association with loneliness among elderly people. The effect was more consistent than the effect of social relationships with family and friends, and the subjective concept of religiosity had no significant effect on loneliness.\n\nOne study compared the effectiveness of four interventions: improving social skills, enhancing social support, increasing opportunities for social interaction, addressing abnormal social cognition (faulty thoughts and patterns of thoughts). The results of the study indicated that all interventions were effective in reducing loneliness, possibly with the exception of social skill training. Results of the meta-analysis suggest that correcting maladaptive social cognition offers the best chance of reducing loneliness.\n\n"}

One of the most renowned Parisian luxury houses, Maison Maquet became official purveyor to Empress Eugénie as well as to several royal courts, winning multiple awards and medals at various World's fairs over the course of its history.\n\nThe Maquet brothers, Hector and Charles, established Maison Maquet in 1841. The eldest Maquet sibling was Auguste Maquet, the novelist, playwright and famous ghost-writer of Alexandre Dumas, for whom he co-wrote several masterpieces such as \"The Three Musketeers\", \"Queen Margot\" and \"The Count of\" \"Monte-Cristo\".\n\nThe Maquet company was created to commercialize the patent for the first machine-made envelopes, the use of which was still little known. This patent, the application for which was filed in 1841 and granted by the French Patent Office on 17 January 1842, described how to manufacture and use the \"envelope-card-letter\" (\"enveloppe-carte-lettre\", in French), also called \"a word in the Mail\" (\"un mot à la Poste\"). The invention of the envelope was the culminating point of a variety of measures taken since the 17th century to preserve correspondence confidentiality.\n\nIn 1846, Hector and Charles Maquet separated their activities: Charles managed the envelopes factory, while Hector ran the boutique shop on Rue de la Paix. In 1864, Hector Maquet registered as a trademark an elegant monogram mixing his initials.\n\nOver time, Maison Maquet changed address numbers several times but remained on Rue de la Paix in Paris: the house was first located at No. 20 from 1841 to 1846, then at No. 24 from 1847 to 1867, and finally at No. 10 from 1868, where it remained for about a century. In the early 1970s, the house moved to 45 Rue Pierre Charron, where it kept a boutique shop until 1993. Though it did not have any commercial branch in the 19th century, Maquet eventually opened one in Nice at 16 Masséna Avenue (now Avenue de Verdun) in the early 20th century.\n\nMaison Maquet soon became one of the most fashionable personal stationery houses and enjoyed great fame during the French Second Empire. It even obtained the warrant of \"official purveyor to Her Majesty the Empress\". Empress Eugénie, wife of Napoleon III regularly visited the shop on Rue de la Paix, where she was served by Madame Maquet.\n\nMaquet was also favored by French aristocratic elites, and its clients included the Princess Pauline von Metternich, as well as the Rohan-Chabot and Costa de Beauregard families.\n\nMaison Maquet's products were particularly trendy among foreign royal courts. Maquet notably supplied the Russian court, including the Great Duchess and the Great Duke Konstantin of Russia. In fact, the French daily newspaper \"Le Figaro\" reported in 1875 that the \"stationary was adorned with the Great Duke's coat of arms, embellished with gold and colors enamel; of unparalleled richness and elegance.\" The Prince Axel of Denmark was also a faithful client of Maquet.\n\nLater on, with the change of political regime and the onset of the IIIrd Republic, Maquet renewed its clientele and started to supply Republican institutions, including the Presidential Palace known as Palais de l’Elysée, Paris City Hall – the Hôtel de Ville de Paris – and French embassies, as well as financial institutions such as the French National Bank.\n\nAnother prestigious customer was the Paris Opera, for which Maquet printed several leaflets and programs.\n\nIn 1908, Maquet changed hands: it became the property of businessman and architect Léon Tissier, who rejuvenated the company through multiple artistic collaborations. Tissier, the son of a travel items manufacturer, also extended Maquet's range of leather goods products. Intent on making his way into the world of printing, he invested in new buildings and printing machinery located rue de Langhouat in the Goutte d’Or neighborhood in Paris, which he eventually yielded to the Établissements Gérault-Fouqueray in 1936.\n\nIn 1990, Maison Maquet was acquired by stationery manufacturer and engraver Cassegrain, only to cease its operations in 1994.\n\nTwenty years later, in 2014, Maquet was taken over by Luvanis, a private investment company specializing in reviving sleeping beauty brands, which was notably behind the revival of trunk maker Moynat, and of couture house Paul Poiret.\n\nMaison Maquet was long regarded as the finest luxury personal stationery in Paris.\n\nAt first, the house specialized in envelopes and luxury stationery, creating custom-made papers with coats of arms and monograms, heraldic paintings on parchment, business cards, wedding invitations, birth announcements, dinner invitations, and dance cards. It then extended its expertise to manufacture luxury leather goods, metalwork, and watches, before branching out to engraving and art printing.\n\nMaquet advertized through witty commercial catalogs, theatre programs, and fashion magazines such as the luxury magazine \"Les Modes\".\n\nMaison Maquet originally produced envelopes and various items of fine stationery. Its most famous in-house paper was known as the \"empress paper\" (\"papier impératrice\"), in an elegant shade of pearly grey between white and azure paper.\n\nMaquet also manufactured travel diaries and notebooks. The French author Prosper Mérimée notably wrote the short novel \"La Chambre Bleue\" in 1866, dedicated to Empress Eugénie, on a Maquet notebook bound with dark green Morocco leather, discreetly hand-tooled in gold leaf.\n\nAt Maquet’s, one could find all manners of writing accessories, from inkpots to blotting paper, including notepads, pencils, dip pens, and even paper knives and letter openers made of chiselled silver.\n\nWhile still producing envelopes and stationery, Maison Maquet became a leading luxury leather goods manufacturer. In addition to her personal stationery, Empress Eugénie also purchased her leather goods at Maquet.\n\nMaquet's luxury leather goods department catered to a clientele of artists such as the French comedian Jane Sabrier, who matched one of her fashionable outfits with a Maquet bag in reindeer leather in 1909.\n\nMaison Maquet proposed a wide range of leather goods, including handbags and travel bags, as well as vanity cases, wallets, cardholders and purses. Maquet also sold lawyers’ satchels (\"serviettes d’avocats\") and garnished tourist blotters (\"buvards-touriste garnis\").\n\nThe house developed a whole line of travel items. Inkpots, paper trays, as well as small leather goods, both sturdy and beautiful, were featured in the house's commercial catalogs.\n\nIn 1938, Maquet was selected to contribute pieces to the trousseau of the two dolls gifted to Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret during the official visit of their parents, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. The gift, intended to reinforce the \"Entente Cordiale\" between France and the United Kingdom, displayed French craftsmanship through a 360-piece trousseau in the tradition of Parisian haute couture. Maquet's contributions consisted in leather goods and accessories: two writing cases, one in blue, the other in red, each with its notepaper monogrammed to the dolls’ initials, and a miniature gold pen.\n\nIn the 1960s, Audrey Hepburn, Hubert de Givenchy's muse, shopped at Maquet's for her leather goods. She notably possessed five Maquet-branded wallets, all made of black leather.\n\nMaquet added watchmaking to its activities, selling bracelet watches and clocks for phaetons and automobiles.\n\nApplying the same craftsmanship to tobacco articles, the house commercialized lighters, cigar and cigarette boxes. In the early 20th century, it made many lighters from Chinese snuff boxes. Maquet became famous for combining old components into new objects in the orientalist fashion typical of decorative arts at the time.\n\nFurthermore, Maquet boxes, renowned for their refinement, were used to store letters as much as jewels.\n\nHector Maquet notably shot the portrait of his brother Auguste. Soon he sold works of other photographers in the Paris boutique, including those of Polish photographer Boleslaw Matuszewski. Frames and photo albums were now also on the shelves of Maison Maquet.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Maison Maquet diversified into engraving, and art printing.\n\nMaquet thus made artistic menus for:\n\n\nMaison Maquet printed, among others, a poster for the third French National Defense Loan, which was conceived by Albert Besnard in 1917, and that for the Peace Loan, illustrated by Henri Lebasque in 1920.\n\nMaquet created posters for Ocean liners, including for the Compagnie de Navigation Sud-Atlantique  and for the Compagnie Générale Transatlantique, commonly known as the \"French Line.”\n\nMaquet, with its experience in stationery, engraving, and printing, as well as its ties to literary men, quite naturally started to develop exclusive bookplates. The Prince of Hohenlohe, who was the Chancellor of the German Empire from 1894 to 1900, had his bookplate engraved by Maquet, as did André Kostolany, Raoul Warocqué (who ordered no less than 10,000 ex-libris from Maquet), and Thyra Seillière.\n\nMaison Maquet developed tight commercial links to other Parisian luxury houses for which it created commercial catalogues. Specifically, Maquet devised the commercial catalogues of perfumers Rigaud, L.T. Piver, and Guerlain.\n\nAdditionally, Maquet conceived ephemerals and various advertising materials for champagne houses such as Moët & Chandon. In 1910, it notably printed a commercial for Charles Heidsieck.\n\nThe house conceived and printed many commercial fans, some of which are kept in the collections of the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris. In particular, Maquet printed many illustrations on advertising fans of Maison Duvelleroy.\n\nMore importantly, Maison Maquet built fruitful partnerships with Paris haute couture houses, such as Paul Poiret, for which it created heading paper, and Jeanne Paquin, for which it created a luxury commercial catalog for \"Fans and fur at Paquin\" in 1911.\n\nMaquet printed the volume \"Les Choses de Paul Poiret vues par George Lepape\" in 1911, whose enduring success mirrors its great influence on the renewal of fashion illustration. Poiret collaborated with drawing artists, including Paul Iribe and Georges Lepape. This 1911 volume broke away from traditional fashion plates and gives both a graphic and a stylized representation of fashion.\n\nFollowing the example set by \"Les Choses de Paul Poiret vues par George Lepape\" (1911), Maison Maquet began publishing an annual luxury magazine, \"Modes et manières d’aujourd’hui,\" each issue of which was beautifully illustrated by a different artist. The first issue, out in 1912, relied once again on Georges Lepape who created 12 colored plates printed on Japanese paper. In 1913, the magazine commissioned Martin, and in 1914 George Barbier.\n\nMaison Maquet collaborated with drawing artists, lithographers, poster makers, and engravers, including:\n\n\n1842 – Patent for a machine manufacturing envelopes (application filed on 16 August 1841, and granted on 17 January 1842).\n\n1849 – Patent for a machine folding envelopes (application filed on 30 August 1848, and granted on 27 October 1849).\n\n1850 – Patent for a machine allowing to simultaneously write and hide what one is writing so as to protect confidentiality (application filed on 9 September 1850, and granted on 2 November 1850).\n\n1853 – Patent for improving envelopes (application filed on 19 July 1853, and granted on 24 August 1853).\n\n1855 – Paris World's Fair: Bronze Medal. In December 1855, \"Le Magasin Pittoresque\" reviewed the Fair, and focused on the inkpot exhibited by Maquet, which was designed by Riester and sculpted in wood by Gayonnet. This inkpot, described as a \"charming luxury piece of furniture,\" combined medieval inspirations and fabulous creatures, fighting an imaginary struggle. This object reminds of Antoine-Louis Barye’s animal sculptures in the romantic style, especially through its expressiveness and violence.\n\n1867 – Paris World's Fair: Silver Medal.\n\n1913 – Ghent World's Fair: Great Prize (Class 92, Stationery).\n\n1925 – International Exhibition of Decorative and Modern Industrial Arts: exhibited (Class 23, Perfumery).\n\n"}
{"id": "4402614", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4402614", "title": "Mass Transit incident (professional wrestling)", "text": "Mass Transit incident (professional wrestling)\n\nThe \"Mass Transit Incident\" was an infamous event in professional wrestling that occurred at an Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) house show on November 23, 1996 at the Wonderland Ballroom in Revere, Massachusetts. It involved Erich Kulas (1979 – May 12, 2002), an aspiring professional wrestler using the ring name \"Mass Transit\", being bladed too deeply by New Jack of The Gangstas during a tag-team match. Two of Kulas' arteries were severed; he bled profusely and passed out, and needed to be escorted out of the arena with medical attention. Further controversy arose when it came to light that Kulas had lied to ECW owner and booker Paul Heyman about his age and professional wrestling training. The incident led to a future ECW pay-per-view being temporarily cancelled and a lawsuit from Kulas' family.\n\nAxl Rotten had been scheduled to work a tag team match with D-Von Dudley against The Gangstas (New Jack and Mustafa Saed), but could not make the show due to a family emergency. Erich Kulas, a wrestling fan who had just turned 17, told ECW owner and booker Paul Heyman that he was 23 and convinced Heyman to allow him to fill in for Rotten by lying that he had been trained by Killer Kowalski, a retired star wrestler who ran a notable wrestling school in the Boston area. Heyman stated afterward that he was unaware of Kulas' real age. Kulas performed as Mass Transit, a Ralph Kramden-esque bus driver gimmick.\n\nBefore the match, Kulas asked New Jack to blade him since he never had done it himself, and New Jack agreed. During the match, Dudley and New Jack brawled outside the ring, while Saed and Transit fought inside the ring. The match was booked as a squash and Dudley was quickly isolated outside the ring. The Gangstas then double-teamed Kulas inside the ring, with New Jack pummeling him with crutches, toasters, and various other objects in the hardcore style ECW was known for. At the end of the match, New Jack bladed Kulas with a surgical scalpel, as the two had agreed, but cut too deeply and severed two arteries in Kulas' forehead. Kulas passed out as blood poured from his head.\n\nThe event was a house show and thus not televised; however, camcorder footage was available, which was eventually used as evidence in legal proceedings. The video showed New Jack quietly asking Kulas, after the blading, \"You alright?\" Next, The Gangstas proceeded to work Kulas over even more with elbow drops and various objects, prompting Kulas' father to scream, \"Ring the fucking bell. He's 17!\" As medics rushed into the ring to aid Kulas, New Jack grabbed the house microphone and shouted, \"I don't care if the motherfucker dies! He's white. I don't like white people. I don't like people from Boston. I'm the wrong nigger to fuck with.\"\n\nThe incident led to the cancellation of ECW's first ever pay-per-view (PPV) event, \"Barely Legal\", by pay-per-view provider Request TV on Christmas Eve, 1996. Heyman, by his own admission in \"The Rise and Fall of ECW\", \"begged and pleaded\" with Request and finally convinced the company that they had been misled. The PPV event was placed back on the schedule on Sunday, April 13, 1997, at 9:00 PM.\n\nKulas and his family later did an interview with \"Inside Edition\" that featured footage from the incident, including New Jack cutting him and berating him after the match. The segment depicted Kulas as an innocent, unprepared victim while vilifying ECW, even going as far as showing that Heyman had not asked for any state identification. The story was completed before the Kulases launched their lawsuit, so key details of how Kulas actually got himself into the match had not been made public at that point.\n\nThree years after the incident, Jerome \"New Jack\" Young was tried on charges of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, and was later sued by the Kulas family. After hearing about Erich Kulas' request to New Jack to blade him, a jury acquitted Young of all charges in the criminal trial, and he was later declared not liable in the civil trial. Performers who testified at Young's trial stated that Kulas was extremely arrogant and demanding backstage prior to the match and, when told that he would have to bleed as part of the match, Kulas had asked Young to blade him, since he had never done it. It was also testified that Kulas' father shouted \"He's only 17!\" and \"Take it easy on him, he's just a kid!\" when they isolated his son from D-Von Dudley during the match and double-teamed him.\n\nThe book \"The Rise and Fall of ECW\" also states that as the medic crew carried Kulas out, he was escorted by Tommy Dreamer, who held his hand to comfort him. Passing by the audience, Kulas began giving them the finger in an attempt to continue \"playing the bad guy\".\n\nAuthorities later determined that Kulas had lied to Heyman about his age and experience; Kulas claimed to be 23 years of age but he was actually 17 years old. He also claimed to have been trained by Killer Kowalski, and his father vouched for him, but Kulas was never trained to wrestle. In \"The Rise and Fall of ECW\", Paul Heyman states that Kulas' dubious credentials as a student of Killer Kowalski were endorsed by a then-known midget wrestler, who was with Kulas when he and his father approached the staff about getting Erich in the match.\n\nErich Kulas died on May 12, 2002 at the age of 22 due to complications from gastric bypass surgery.\n\n"}

They live a semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle in the coastal and rainforest environments of the islands. The Mentawai population is estimated to be about 64,000. The Mentawai language belongs to the Austronesian language family. The people are characterised by their heavy spirituality, body art and their tendency to sharpen their teeth, a practice they feel makes one beautiful.\n\nThe Mentawai live in the traditional dwelling called the uma which is a longhouse and is made by weaving bamboo strips together to make walls and thatching the roofs with grass, the floor is raised on stilts and is made of wood planks.\n\nThe main clothing for men is a loin cloth. Mentawai adorn themselves with necklaces and flowers in their hair and ears. Women wear a cloth wound around the waist and small sleeveless vests. Mentawai sharpen their teeth with a chisel for aesthetic reasons. Tattooing is done with a needle and wood which is hammered on the needle by a shaman called \"sikerei\".\n\nTattooing on the island was an identity and a personal or communal reflection of the people's relationship to nature, called \"arat subulungan\", although there are motivational and design differences from region to region and among clans.\n\nDuring the pre-independence era, the cultural influence of foreign colonials and other islanders had systematically displaced or obliterated indigenous customs and religions. In postcolonial times, the Indonesian government continued this policy with a 1954 decree that prohibited indigenous religions, effectively abolishing tattooing and other customs.\n\nThe traditional knife of the Mentawai people is called Palitai, while their traditional shield is called Kurabit.\n\nMen hunt wild pigs, deer and primates.

{"id": "34453811", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34453811", "title": "Moraingy", "text": "Moraingy\n\nMoraingy (Malagasy) or Moringue (French) is a weaponless, bare-fisted striking style of traditional martial art that originated during the Maroseranana dynasty (1675–1896) of the Sakalava Kingdom of western coastal Madagascar. It has since become popularized throughout Madagascar, but particularly in coastal regions, and has spread to neighboring Indian Ocean islands including Réunion, Mayotte, Comoros, Seychelles and Mauritius. Participation in this form of combat was originally limited to young men, allowing elders to judge their physical fitness and strength while providing an opportunity for the youth to gain prestige and test their abilities. Today, while the average age of participants is still between 10 and 35, young people of both genders may practice the sport. Participants are called \"kidabolahy\" (young men) or \"kidabo mpanao moraingy\" (young people who practice moraingy) and are widely respected and even feared by fellow villagers. In the North, they are called \"Fagnorolahy\", and the assistants, \"magnafo\". Moraingy matches must by tradition be accompanied by music (often \"salegy\") to induce a trance-like state in the fighters and participants, contributing to the spiritual and communal experience of the fight. As part of this experience, participants typically engage in dances during and between the matches that are meant to provoke the supporters of the opposing party, while the crowd cheers and jeers loudly.\n\nA typical moraingy competition consists of a series of matches pitting two fighters, typically from different villages, against one another. Prior to the fight, all the fighters parade around in the outdoor arena (typically a soccer field) to size up and select their potential adversaries, while the spectators who ring the field cheer, sing and attempt to provoke the fighters. The matches are announced and each clan sings its own chant in support of the fighter from its village. Each match lasts only one round and ends when one of the fighters exits the arena, faints, is no longer able to defend himself, is clearly unequal to the other, or is determined to be seriously injured. The judges of the match declare a victor and no contesting of the determination is permitted; both participants are cheered by the spectators for their efforts in the match.\n\nMoraingy is considered a half-distance or long-range fighting sport with punches predominating but with some kicks permitted. Types of punches include straight punches (\"mitso\"), hooks (\"mandraoky\"), downward slanting punches (\"vangofary\") and a punch similar to an uppercut (\"vangomioriky\"). Defenses include guarding and sidesteps, but neither the attacks nor defenses are standardized, creating higher variability among individual fighters and between regions than in international boxing.\n\nAlthough moraingy is primarily concentrated in the coastal regions of Madagascar where it was historically popularized, Malagasy migrants took the sport with them when traveling overseas. In Reunion Island, a French territory 500 kilometers east of Madagascar, where a large number of Malagasy people were brought by the French to work as slave laborers on sugar plantations, the sport took root under the name \"moringue\", or \"batay kreol\". Originally limited to the laborer's quarters of the sugar plantations, in 2005 it was recognized by the Reunion government as an official sport of the island. The popularization of the sport is in part due to a growing acknowledgement of the Malagasy and African origins of the island's Creole community. The Reunionais form of moraingy is less violent and more inspired by the choreography and acrobatics of Brazilian \"capoeira\" than the original Malagasy form. The use of jumps and stomping makes it spectacular. As in Madagascar, music is played throughout moringue matches, typically consisting of percussion or Reunionais \"maloya\" music. The government recognition of the sport was intended to foster a sense of pride and identity for the large Creole youth population of Reunion island. Moringue is now organized like other mainstream sports, with about 1000 licencees, and receives local media attention. The most celebrated Reunionais moringue athlete is Jean-Rene Dreinaza.\n"}

While some use an altitudinal difference of 300 m inside an area to define that zone as mountainous, others consider differences from 1000 m or more, depending on the areas' latitude. Additionally, some include steepness to define mountain regions, hence excluding high plateaus (e.g. the Andean Altiplano or the Tibetan Plateau), zones often seen to be mountainous. A more pragmatic but useful definition has been proposed by the Italian Statistics Office ISTAT, which classifies municipalities as mountainous\n\n\nThe United Nations Environmental Programme has produced a map of mountain areas worldwide using a combination of criteria, including regions with\n\n\nIn a broader sense, mountain research is considered any research \"in\" mountain regions: for instance disciplinary studies on Himalayan plants, Andean rocks, Alpine cities, or Carpathian people. It is comparable to research that concentrates on the Arctic and Antarctic (polar research) or coasts (coastal research).\n\nIn a narrower sense, mountain research focuses \"on\" mountain regions, their description and the explanation of the human-environment interaction in (positive) and the sustainable development of (normative) these areas. So-defined mountain research is situated at the nexus of natural sciences, social sciences and humanities. Drawing on Alexander von Humboldt's work in the Andean realm, mountain geography and ecology are considered core areas of study; nevertheless important contributions are coming from anthropology, geology, economics, history or spatial planning. In sum, a narrowly defined mountain research applies an interdisciplinary and integrative regional approach. Slaymaker summarizes:\n\nMountain research or \"orology\"—not to be confused with orography—, is sometimes denominated \"montology\". This term stems from Carl Troll's \"mountain geoecology\"—geoecology being Troll's English translation of the German \"Landschaftsökologie\"—and appeared at a meeting in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1977. Since then, scholars such as Jack D. Ives, Bruno Messerli and Robert E. Rhoades have claimed the development of montology as interdisciplinary mountain research. The term montology was included in the Oxford English Dictionary in 2002. It defines montology as:\n\nOn the one hand, the term \"montology\" received criticism due to the mix of Latin (\"mōns\", pl. \"montēs\") and Greek (\"logos\"). On the other hand, however, this is also the—well accepted—case in several, already established disciplines such as glaciology or sociology.\n\nThe following list includes peer-reviewed journals that have a focus on mountain research and are open to both the natural and the social sciences:\n\n\n\n"}

NAEYC is focused on improving the well-being of young children, with particular emphasis on the quality of educational and developmental services for children from birth through age 8.\n\nIn the 1920s, concern over the varying quality of emerging nursery school programs in the United States inspired Patty Smith Hill to gather prominent figures in the field to decide how to best ensure the existence of high-quality programs. Meeting in Washington, DC, the group negotiated the issue of a manual, called \"Minimum Essentials for Nursery Education,\" that set out standards and methods of acceptable nursery schools. Three years later, the group cemented the existence of a professional association of nursery school experts named the National Association for Nursery Education (NANE). NANE changed its name to NAEYC in 1964.\n\nThe association has existed for over 80 years. Its holds two national early childhood conferences per year, the NAEYC Annual Conference & Expo and the NAEYC National Institute for Early Childhood Professional Development. The NAEYC Annual Conference & Expo is the largest early childhood education conference in the world. The association publishes periodicals, books, professional development materials, and resources, all of which relate to the education of young children. The association is also active in public policy work. The association is well known for accrediting high-quality child care/preschool centers, and more than 10,000 centers, programs and schools have earned NAEYC Accreditation.\n\nNAEYC accredits early childhood programs according to health, safety and education standards it first launched in 1985 and reinvented and released in September 2006.\nThe new standards were intended to provide a more reliable and accountable accreditation system and to encourage the field of early childhood education to strive for a new level of excellence.\n\nNAEYC also accredits academic degree programs for early childhood educators.\n\nNAEYC has a structure of state and local Affiliates that are semi-autonomous but that are required to contribute part of the membership dues to the national organization. The Office of Affiliate Relations provides direct services to NAEYC State Affiliates, Local Affiliate Chapters, and Affiliate Alliances to support them in their efforts to build capacity and become high-performing, inclusive organizations.\n\nNAEYC provides many different programs to assist professionals who work to educate young children. They are a leading publisher of educational resources, which include books, videos and posters that can assist in the teaching of young children. NAEYC also publishes two scholarly journals to help early childhood professionals and parents stay informed about the latest research on educating children age 0-8. These journals are \"Young Children\" and \"Early Childhood Research Quarterly.\" In 2007, NAEYC also developed \"Teaching Young Children\", a magazine written for preschool teachers. The magazine provides useful, research-based ideas that teachers can use in their classrooms. Every year the NAEYC offers several conferences where participants can learn about and receive professional development in their field as well as focus on the improvements that have been made in the practices, policies and research.\n\nNAEYC goes beyond publications, conferences and videos, and offers a program called “Supporting Teachers, Strengthening Families” that is designed to assist in the fight to prevent child abuse and promote healthy social and emotional development in young children. This program works by teaching the educators how to better communicate with the families of their students. Another important program sponsored by the NAEYC is the “Week of the Young Child”. This is a week-long promotion every spring that brings public awareness to the importance of early childhood development and education.\n\nNAEYC encourages its supporters to be informed of current issues and legislation that affect the lives of young children. At the NAEYC Children's Champions Action Center, individuals can find information about the federal legislative process, learn how to contact members of Congress, and see the daily agenda for the House and the Senate.\n\nNAEYC believes that our nation is at a crossroads. An integrated system of early childhood care and education that includes comprehensive approaches that directly involve families and communities in program design, implementation, and evaluation must be developed. NAEYC believes Americans can invest now in our children and families and enjoy long-term savings, with a more vibrant nation of healthy, achieving children and more stable families. Or, they can fail to make the investment and pay the price: increased delinquency, greater educational failures, lowered productivity, less economic competitiveness, and fewer adults prepared to be effective, loving parents to the next generation of children.\n\nFederal, state and local government, communities, parents, and the private sector must share in the responsibility of ensuring the well-being of children and families.\n\nIn order to keep the programs going, NAEYC members must pay dues for funding of the programs they run. In September 2012, the NAEYC members at that time received a letter/e-mail regarding a due increase. This was the first time since 2000 that there was an increase in dues.\n\nThe following periodic publications are released and sponsored by NAEYC:\n\nYoung Children\n\n\"Young Children\" is a peer reviewed journal published bi-monthly by the National Association for the Education of Young Children. In this journal, issues are organized around topical clusters that devote special attention to issues in the field of early childhood education.\n\nTeaching Young Children\n\n\"Teaching Young Children\" is a magazine specifically designed for preschool teachers. It highlights current thinking on best practices in early childhood education, innovations in the field, research and its implications, and interesting ideas for and from preschool teachers. The articles and other features reinforce the accreditation criteria for the NAEYC Early Childhood Program Standards on Relationships and Teaching and encourage effective teaching in the preschool years.\n\nEarly Childhood Research Quarterly\n\n\"Early Childhood Research Quarterly\" is a research journal that is published four times a year, and contains current research in early childhood.\n\nIn addition to these periodicals, NAEYC produces formal position statements from time to time to \"state the Association's position on issues related to early childhood education practice, policy, and/or professional development for which there are controversial or critical opinions.\" These position statements are typically produced by NAEYC to include in-depth discussion of specific issues such as Early Learning Standards, Teacher Certification or Media Violence. In a few instances, NAEYC has issued position statements jointly with other authorities. A recent example is the 2012 position statement titled \"Technology and Interactive Media as Tools in Early Childhood Programs Serving Children from Birth through Age 8\", produced jointly with the Fred Rogers Center for Early Learning and Children's Media at Saint Vincent College.\n\nCaring for Children in Low-Income Families: A Substudy of the National Child Care Survey, 1990\n\n\"Caring for Children in Low-Income Families\" is a study that NAEYC conducted with The Urban Institute in 1990 on affordable child care facilities for low- income families. This book explores multiple different aspects of the lives of low-income children and day care. The study also examines aspects of the family lives. For example, whether a home has a single parent, two parents, unemployed parents, or other odd family situations and how that effects the children and their abilities to receive proper education. This was a very thorough and detailed study conducted by NAEYC and it helped them to better suit their own child care facilities to adapt to the needs of low-income families.\n\n\n"}

Every year St Bernadette's Primary School in Coventry, where he teaches, competes with a local private school (Oakmoor) to see who can produce the best nativity play. Paul hates Christmas because his ex-girlfriend Jennifer Lore, who attended drama school with him, left him at Christmas before he could propose to her.\n\nDespite this, the St Bernadette's headteacher Mrs Bevans tasks him with running their nativity play this year, and gives him a new class teaching assistant called Mr Poppy, who turns out to be as much of a child as the rest of Paul's class. As every year, it is one of Paul's other friends from drama school, Gordon Shakespeare, who runs the nativity plays at rival school Oakmoor.\n\nDetermined not to be seen as a failure by his old rival, Paul lies to Shakespeare about how a Hollywood producer, their old friend Jennifer, will be turning his production into a Hollywood film, though he hasn't even spoken to her in five years. Mr Poppy accidentally overhears this and is so excited that he has to spread the rumour. Soon, Paul finds his lie is out of control, and all he can do is go along with it as media attention mounts and the children get more and more excited, so Paul has to try to actually get Hollywood to turn their production to a film.\n\nDonald Peterson is an anxious teacher who has just moved to a new house with his pregnant wife Sarah. He accepts a teaching job at St. Bernadette's primary school, taking over the class formerly taught by Mr. Maddens, who by this point has left for the United States. In the interim, the enthusiastic and childlike teaching assistant Mr. Poppy has been teaching the class unaided.\n\nThe class wants to enter in a competition called \"A Song for Christmas\", in which each school produces a Christmas song, with the winning song earning its school £10,000 and the chance at being a Christmas #1. However, headteacher Mrs. Bevan refuses the class permission to enter without a qualified teacher, and worries that Mr. Poppy's behaviour is so inappropriate that no teacher will stay in the job.\n\nWhen Mr. Poppy decides St Bernadette's should enter the National 'Song for Christmas' competition, he persuades Donald to sign the entry forms, later kidnapping him for an impromptu road trip to Gastell Llawen (\"Merry Castle\", not a real place) in Wales, where the competition is being held.\n\nThis movie stars Martin Clunes, Marc Wootton, Catherine Tate with Celia Imrie and Jason Watkins.\n\nJeremy Shepherd is an Ofsted inspector who is the father of Lauren and is due to marry his fiancée Sophie in New York. However, he is hit in the forehead by Mr Poppy's pet donkey Alfie. He has amnesia, and no memory of anything that happened before.\n\nIt was confirmed on 4 December 2017 that \"Nativity 4\" had been greenlit, and will be released on Friday 23 November 2018, the film will be entitled \"Nativity Rocks! This Ain't No Silent Night\". A teaser trailer was released in July 2018.\n\nCasting includes; Simon Lipkin, Daniel Boys, Craig Revel Horwood, Bradley Walsh, Meera Syal, Helen George, Ruth Jones, Celia Imrie, Hugh Dennis and Anna Chancellor, Ramin Karimloo as well as some of the cast from the original theatre musical cast.\n\nIn an interview, Debbie Isitt said \"Nativity 4 has been developed already and so has Nativity 5 – one of them is set ‘Down Under’ in Australia\". She later added \"However, I am uncertain as to if or when they will be made as there are other projects competing for my attention. We will just have to see.\"\n\nNick revealed that they had so far \"politely declined\" offers to make American and Australian remakes.\n\nOn 17 November 2016 it was announced that the first film will be adapted into a stage musical, making its world premiere at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre in October 2017, before touring to Cliffs Pavilion, Southend, Sheffield Lyceum Theatre, Manchester Palace Theatre, Plymouth Theatre Royal, Eventim Apollo, and Leeds Grand Theatre over the Christmas season.\n\nIt was written and directed by Debbie Isitt with music by Isitt and Nicky Ager, choreography by Andrew Wright and design by David Woodhead.

The initiative followed an earlier New7Wonders of the World campaign, and attracted 100 million votes from around the world before voting finished on November 11, 2011.\n\nThe New7Wonders of Nature campaign started in 2007, immediately after the campaign to elect the man-made New7Wonders of the World, in which more than 100 million votes were cast.

Their increasingly contradictory descriptions of shared experiences contribute to the humour. This unreliable narration adds to the atmosphere around deceiving \"the marks\", but the characters' different perspectives on their mutual relationship (interspersed with Silas's day-dreams of a dishonourable wartime incident) look more like self-deception and often add a poignant note.

{"id": "8630409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8630409", "title": "Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery", "text": "Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery\n\nThe Oxford Symposium on Food & Cookery is an annual weekend conference at which academics, food writers, cooks, and others with an interest in food and culture meet to discuss current issues in food studies and food history.\n\nThe Symposium has taken place every year since 1983, with the proceedings published in an annual volume about a year later. Since 2006 the annual venue has been St Catherine's College, Oxford. The Oxford Symposium has been a Charitable Trust since January 2003. Influential in its field, the Oxford Symposium is the oldest such annual meeting in the world, though a series of scientific conferences on the anthropology and ethnology of food began in the 1970s.\nThe Oxford Symposium is a registered charity in Britain, with a group of distinguished Trustees, and there is a support group called Friends of the Oxford Symposium.\n\nThe origin of the Symposium is traced to a series of three historical seminars on science and cookery arranged in 1979 by the scholar and former diplomat Alan Davidson (who was Alistair Horne Research Fellow at St Antony's College, Oxford for 1978/79) and sponsored by Theodore Zeldin, historian of France and a fellow of St Antony's. Zeldin had asked Davidson: \"Tell me ... how do you propose to make manifest to the other members of the college your presence here?\" The seminars were the answer. About twenty people attended on each occasion. The title of the first seminar, on 4 May 1979, was that of Davidson's fellowship, \"Food and Cookery: the Impact of Science in the Kitchen\". Academic disciplines represented ranged from the history of medicine to mathematics and French literature; Nicholas Kurti, Professor Emeritus of Physics at Oxford, was among them, and some of the 21 participants were not academics at all. Elizabeth David was among them, though she was reported to be \"ambivalent at best\" about the value of this academic approach to food. Also present were David's publisher Jill Norman, Anne Willan, Paul Levy and Richard Olney.\nThe second seminar, a week later, focused on 19th century research on food chemistry, notably Friedrich Accum's \"Culinary Chemistry\" (1821) and the writings of Justus Liebig. The third meeting became a general discussion of cookery books in their historical context. On this occasion Elizabeth David enunciated the rule-of-thumb that it takes a generation (a minimum of 25 years) for a newly devised dish to pass from the kitchen to the written record. Claudia Roden joined the group on 11 May; by 18 May participants included Jane Grigson, Elizabeth Lambert Ortiz, Sri Owen and the Dutch food writers Berthe Meijer and Titia Bodon.\n\nThe next event in the series was a one-day meeting at St Antony's College in May 1980, chaired by Davidson and Zeldin. Participants, numbering nearly seventy, included many from overseas. The topic, the history of cookery books, had been prefigured in a brief article by Davidson, published in the first issue of the food history journal, \"Petits Propos Culinaires\", in 1979. Speakers included Kai Brodersen, then at St John's College, Oxford, on cookery writing in Europe before the era of the printed book, and Claudia Roden on Islamic cookery manuscripts. The event was \"best described as a symposium, since one attractive feature of it was that everyone brought food they had prepared themselves\". Culinary contributions by Sonia Blech and Josephine Bacon were noted; Nicholas Kurti served \"Bombe Allotropique (Graphite-Diamant)\", a dish he had invented 25 years earlier at the annual Diamond Conference to celebrate the production of artificial diamonds at the General Electric Research Laboratory in Schenectady. The proceedings were not published in volume form, but one paper appeared in \"Petits Propos Culinaires\" no. 5 and three more in no. 6.\n\nThe first full symposium, announced in October 1980, took place over two days in September 1981. There were nearly 150 participants, including 12 from the United States and seven from France: the latter included Jean-Louis Flandrin and . The majority were food writers, academics in food studies, publishers and journalists; there were few chefs. Plenary sessions took place on the first day, and papers had been circulated in advance. Participants split into three groups for the sessions on the second day, which were then summarized by rapporteurs in a final plenary. Maria Johnson, speaking on \"North Balkan Food Past and Present\", showed photographs of two models found in archaeological excavations in Bulgaria and claimed to be as much as 7,000 years old, one of a bread oven and one of a loaf decorated with impressions of acorns. The archaeologist Helen M. Leach spoke on \"Cooking Without Pots\" in prehistoric and traditional Polynesian cuisine; Raymond Sokolov, American cookery writer, discussed Southern cooking, describing it as \"the major surviving native cuisine in the USA\" and defending the popularity of deep frying, \"an ideal method for the restaurateur\". Speakers in Near Eastern cuisines included Charles Perry, editor on the \"Los Angeles Times\", who discussed \"Three Medieval Arabic Cook Books\". R. E. F. Smith, professor of Russian at Birmingham, was one of two speakers on the history of Russian food. There was a session in which symposiasts attempted, but failed, to devise a test for distinguishing bogus from authentic regional styles of cookery, a question that was to be taken up again in the 2005 symposium, \"Authenticity in the Kitchen\". The 1981 proceedings were published in volume form, the first occasion on which this was done.\n\nThe 1983 symposium, described by one participant as \"solemn but light-hearted\", had the catch-title \"Food In Motion\". The theme was the migration of foodstuffs and cookery techniques, including the most significant single such migration event in history, recently studied in Alfred W. Crosby's \"The Columbian Exchange\" (1972). Other major topics included the historical significance of the potato in Ireland, discussed by the social historian Jillian Strang and the food writer Joyce Toomre. There was a discussion by Raymond Sokolov and others of the origins of \"nouvelle cuisine\" (in and around 1972) and \"cuisine minceur\", the approach championed by Michel Guérard. Sokolov allocated the principal role in these innovations to Paul Bocuse, Fernand Point, Guérard's book \"La Cuisine gourmande\" and the work of the Troisgros brothers; he pointed out the close relationship between Japanese culinary tradition and \"nouvelle cuisine\". At this 1983 symposium it was agreed that the event should repeat annually.\n\nThere is no published volume of proceedings corresponding to the 1984 symposium, which took as its theme \"the ideal cookery book and recipe\". Many contributions consisted of recipes \"with comments upon their composition and their culinary possibilities\", a form unsuited to reprinting in the usual volume format; some of the others were published elsewhere. Fourteen remaining papers appeared in a two-year volume, alongside the 1985 symposium proceedings, under the section title \"Cookery Books and the Transmission of Recipes\". The 1985 proceedings have the section title \"Foodways, Science & Lore in the Kitchen\", though the original symposium title was \"Science, Tradition and Superstition in the Kitchen\". Organised by Tom Jaine, restaurateur and restaurant critic, it was the largest symposium so far, with 150 delegates from Britain, many European countries, Australia and the United States. Among them it was possible to identify \"six cooks/hoteliers, thirty-one journalists/writers, thirteen publishers/editors, nine historians, seven booksellers ... and twenty-three academics\". The archaeologist Bruce Kraig traced the history of cynophagy in the prehistoric record and in anthropological reports. Aphrodisiacs were discussed by food writers and medical specialists, and at least one traditional aphrodisiac, Chinese three penis wine, was available for tasting. Unusual foods at the regular bring-your-own lunch included \"gravad lax\" and chocolate-covered garlic. The keynote talk was \"Science and the Study of Food\" by Harold McGee, whose \"On Food and Cooking: the Science and Lore of the Kitchen\" had been published in 1984. Anthropologists Gerald and Valerie Mars offered a classification of food scholars and enthusiasts on the grid/group scales developed by Mary Douglas. Their title was \"Classifying Cuisines: Epicures, Isolates, Messmates and Cultists\".\n\nBy this time the Oxford Symposium claimed imitators elsewhere in the world: there had been four recent conferences under the aegis of the American Institute of Wine & Food, while other series of symposia were under way in Australia, Turkey and New England (the latter hosted by the Culinary Historians of Boston).\nSince 1986 the proceedings have been unvaryingly published in an annual volume (see \"List of published symposia\" below). The 1986 theme was \"The Cooking Medium\", and three data papers were circulated in advance: two by Alan Davidson, \"Edible Fats and Oils\" and \"Thickeners\", and a multilingual survey by Jenny Macarthur, \"Oils, Fats and Dairy Products: notes and lists of names\". Many less-than-universal cooking media were discussed, including sheep's tail fat (by Jill Tilsley Benham), caul fat (by Jane Grigson) and almond milk (by the medieval scholar Constance B. Hieatt). Sami Zubaida of Birkbeck College spoke on \"Oils and Fats in the Middle East\", while Barbara Santich gave a historical outline of medieval thickeners. Among the more unusual tastes explored in the 1987 symposium on \"Taste\" was pekmez (in a paper by Nevin Halici). Esther Balogh spoke on paprika, Bruce Kraig on hot dogs and Joan Morgan on apples, soon to be the subject of her definitive \"The Book of Apples\" (1993). Historical papers were given by Anna del Conte on 18th century Naples and Charles Perry on Near Eastern rotted condiments (including Murri). \"The Cooking Pot\" as the theme for 1988 was suggested by Patience Gray. It was addressed by 25 speakers including, for the first time, Sophie D. Coe, who spoke on \"The Maya Chocolate Pot and Its Descendants\". Others who addressed the symposium for the first time included Michael Abdalla, a scholar of the modern Assyrians of the Near East (and an Assyrian himself), the anthropologist Jeremy MacClancy, the medievalist Terence Scully and the Greek food writer Rena Salaman. At the 1989 symposium, which took the theme of \"Staple Foods\" and was for the first time organized by Harlan Walker, plenary sessions were addressed by the archaeologist Keith Botsford, the food historian Andrew Dalby and the nutritionist Erica F. Wheeler, who asked: \"Do Processed Societies Have Staple Foods?\"\n\nFrom 1990 onwards conferences were held in September of each year. The theme for 1990 was \"Fasts and Feasts\", and plenary sessions were addressed by Astri Riddervold, Bjorn Fjellheim and Marit Ekne Ruud. Historian Phyllis Pray Bober spoke on \"The Black or Hell Banquet\", a kind of \"jeu d'esprit\" arranged by the emperor Domitian, by Grimod de La Reynière and others through history. Robert Chenciner argued that the barbecue depicted on the Bayeux Tapestry proved that the tapestry was not an 11th-century artefact: the argument rested on \"not entirely firm grounds\" according to Paul Levy. At the 1991 symposium, on the theme of \"Public Eating\", the plenary paper, \"Utility and Symbol in Public Eating\", was given by Sami Zubaida. Richard Hosking spoke on \"Pavement Food, Packed Meals and Picnics in Japan\", Doreen Fernandez on \"Balut to Barbecue: Philippine Street Food\", Robert A. Leonard on \"Food, Drink and Swahili Public Space\", Barbara Wheaton on \"Expositions universelles\" and Sharon Hudgins on \"The Beer Taverns of Prague\". The published volume of the 1992 symposium is entitled \"Spicing Up the Palate\". Aromatics that were discussed included silphium (Alice Arndt), rosewater (Helen Saberi), chocolate (Sophie Coe and Alice Wooledge Salmon), mastic (Rena Salaman and Nevin Halici) and annatto (Elisabeth Lambert Ortiz). Margaret Visser spoke on moretum, likening it to \"ancient Roman pesto\", while Loret Lee discussed flavour water or \"lu sui\", a flavouring prominent in Chinese cuisine. \"Look and Feel\" was the subject of the 1993 symposium.\nThe 1994 theme was \"Going Today: Gone Tomorrow? Endangered Foods and Dishes\". Fat-tailed sheep recurred in Charles Perry's paper; June di Schino discussed and offered samples of the monastic confectionery of southern Italy, including (from the monastery of Santa Maria dell'Itria in Sciacca, Sicily) honey cookies made in the shape of a woman with three breasts. Gastronomic events at the 1994 symposium included the most authentic Mexican meal yet seen in Britain, featuring huitlacoche and amaranth greens flown in from Mexico. This feast was organized by Bruce Kraig and prepared by Dudley Nieto. Plenary sessions were addressed by Jeremy Cherfas of the Henry Doubleday Research Association on \"Vanishing Vegetable Varieties -- and How to Save Them\" and by Camellia Panjabi of Taj Hotels on \"The Non-Emergence of the Regional Foods of India\", the Punjabification of Indian food and the universality of tandoori chicken. The Australian food journalist Cherry Ripe had proposed the theme and gave the keynote address. Titled \"Dying of Starvation in the Supermarket\", her talk surveyed the problem of diminishing bio-diversity in domesticated animals and plants. As participants noted, \"the continued existence of many breeds ... depends on their being eaten by man\"; therefore \"it could be (and was) argued that vegetarianism is immoral\".\n\nThe 1995 symposium, on the theme of \"Cooks and Other People\", was the last to feature a Saturday do-it-yourself lunch to which symposiasts brought unusual foods from all over the world: organizers concluded this was \"no longer possible with the present rules of hygiene\". This lunch ended with two spectacular dessert, instant ice cream (Peter Barham poured liquid nitrogen into a bowl of crême anglaise) and sorbet: Robin Weir used Château d'Yquem, the \"premier cru supérieur\" Sauternes, as the basis for this costly delicacy. Gillian Riley spoke on \"Platina, Martino and Their Circle\"; cooks under discussion ranged from Mithaecus to Dorothy Hartley and from Nikolaos Tselementes to Martha Stewart, while \"other people\" who had influenced cuisine included Alexander the Great, John Calvin and Nils Gustav Dalén (Nobel laureate and inventor of the Aga). The 1996 theme was \"Food on the Move\". The title of Philip Iddison's paper was \"Arabian Travellers' Observations on Bedouin Food\"; Claudia Roden's was \"Food in the Sephardi diaspora\". Helen M. Leach traced the history of the pavlova, Layinka Swinburne the use of ship's biscuit and portable soup, and Colin Spencer the spread of the rocambole. Chef Fritz Blank spoke on \"Travelers' Diarrhea: the Science of Montezuma's Revenge\".\n\n\"Fish: Food from the Waters\" was the title of the 1997 symposium, and the papers fulfilled the promise not just of the catchword but also of the subtitle. Two American academics, both prolific food history authors, made early appearances: Ken Albala spoke on \"Fish in Renaissance Dietary Theory\", while Andrew F. Smith, traced the cultural links between garum and ketchup. Kathie Webber spoke on a South African delicacy, Pondoland oysters.Two food scientists contributed, Harold McGee with reference to snake mackerel, orange roughy and their slippery lipids, while Nicholas Kurti (one of the earliest symposiasts) discussed the freshwater carp, catfish (\"Silurus glanis\") and pike that were dietary staples in the Hungary of his childhood. \"Food in the Arts\", the 1998 topic, was also interpreted widely. There was a generous survey by Joan Alcock of food in detective novels, with due attention to the gourmand Maigret, while Barbara Haber's topic was food in American film and Andrew Coe spoke on food in Santería. Among papers relevant to painting were Robert Irwin's \"The Disgusting Dinners of Salvador Dali\" and Gillian Riley's study of the still lifes of Luis Meléndez. The 1999 symposium was heralded by Nicholas Wroe in the \"Guardian\": \"51 papers on the theme of Milk: Its Uses, Products and Substitutes, embracing history, health, chemistry and sociology will be delivered to an audience of 200 historians, scientists and writers as well as domestic and commercial cooks Ove Fosså explored the true age of Norwegian gamalost cheese, and Carolin Young revisited Marie Antoinette's dairy (\"la Laiterie de la Reine\") at Rambouillet. The title of the published symposium volume was \"Milk: Beyond the Dairy\".\n\n\"Next year it's Food and Memory,\" wrote Nicholas Wroe in the article just cited. \"Book early and don't forget your madeleines.\" Sure enough, among the speakers at the 2000 symposium, Rose Arnold took Proust as her subject and alluded to the same literary memory in her title, \"Madeleines and Other Aides-Mémoire: the importance of food references in Proust's \"Recherche\"\". Andrew Dalby looked at the meals in Suetonius's \"Lives of the Caesars\" and their sources in the collective memory. Geraldene Holt spoke on \"Memories of M. F. K. Fisher\". More uncomfortably, Andrew F. Smith spoke on \"False Memories: the invention of culinary fakelore and food fallacies\". Next year the symposium theme was \"The Meal\", for which Philip Iddison drew on his own experience with \"Perpetual Picnics: the meal in the UAE\" and Sami Zubaida also focused on the Islamic world with \"Drink in the Structure of the Meal: Middle Eastern patterns\". A joint paper by Chris Grocock and Sally Grainger looked at a Roman poetic lunch, \"Moretum: a peasant lunch revisited\". Fat was the subject for 2002. The title of the joint paper by Gerald and Valerie Mars, anthropologist and historian respectively, was \"Fat in the Victorian Kitchen: a medium for cooking, control, deviance and crime.\" Regina Sexton spoke on butter in the diet of monks and penitents in medieval Ireland. Diana Farr Louis and Linda Makris both chose topics related to fat and fasting in Greece. The published volume, under the title \"The Fat of the Land\", would be the last edited by Harlan Walker.\n\nThe theme for 2003 was \"Nurture\". This was the last symposium attended by Alan Davidson, who had founded the series of symposia in 1979. He had just been awarded the Erasmus Prize, and this was celebrated at a Sunday lunch in his honour. The published volume was edited for the first time by Richard Hosking, an academic who worked in Japan for many years, a specialist in Japanese food, and a regular symposiast. Until 2003 the symposia had continued to be hosted at St Antony's College. In 2004 they moved to Oxford Brookes University. The theme of the first symposium in this new location was \"Wild Food\".\n\"Authenticity in the Kitchen\" was the subject for 2005.\n\nSince 2006 the venue for the Oxford Food Symposium has been St Catherine's College. \n\nFrequent speakers not already mentioned include the American writer Jeffrey Steingarten. Many topics have had their first airing at the Oxford Symposium, including the expression \"molecular gastronomy.\"\n\n\n\n"}

The word 'Si' in Penang Hokkien language mean 'dead'. It reflects the nature of the card game, where the hand is dead, with no drawing of new cards or exchanging of cards throughout the whole game. It is this feature that distinguish itself from other Rummy variants.\n\nThe basic concept is the same as most Rummy games is to form melds, eliminating deadwood cards. \"Deadwood\" cards are those that do not form part of a meld. They are undesirable and counted towards players' points at the end of each game. The objective is have less points the opponents.\n\nPenang Rummy is played with 2 standard 52-card packs of playing cards plus 6 jokers as wildcards. A total of 110 cards is used. Sometimes 8 jokers are used instead of 6.\n\nThe ideal number of players is 4. Sometimes a game can commence with 3 players, in which case each player will receive more cards to begin with. A two-handed game is rarely played, and for five or more players an additional pack of cards is used.\n\nThe first dealer is determined randomly. Subsequent dealers change from game to game. Two basic systems are used to determine the dealer. In a game where points are not recorded, the player with the highest points in the last game (the worst loser) will deal. He is deemed to \"pay a small forfeit\" by doing a service for all by taking up the task of dealing the cards.\n\nIn a game where points are recorded, the player who won the last game will deal. He is deemed to have benefited from the last game, especially when money is at stake, and hence should provide a service to all by doing the task of dealing as a gesture of appreciation.\n\nThe dealer starts the dealing with the player to his left. This goes on in a clockwise manner, until each player receives 20 cards. In a 3-player game, each player will receive 25 cards instead of 20. The remaining cards are put aside and play no further role in the game.\n\nThe game starts with the player on the left of the dealer, and goes on in clockwise manner. On each turn, player must take at least 1 action of either melding or laying off. He can of course decide to do both. A player, however, \"cannot\" skip his turn.\n\nThere is no upper limit in number of actions a player can take per turn. For example, a player may decide to make 2 melds, then lay off 1 card to an existing run and lay off 2 cards to an existing set, all in a single turn. In each game, a player must first do a meld, before he/she can do any lay-offs. The first meld in a game is called a \"passport\".\n\nNote that Penang Rummy or Si Rummy does not have the action of drawing a card or discarding unwanted cards. This is the distinctive feature of this Rummy variant.\n\nIf a player has 3 or more cards that meet the criteria of a \"run\" or a \"set\" below, he may meld by laying these cards, face up, in front of him. The melds are like typical Rummy games:\n\n\nA player may also choose to \"lay off\" some cards on an existing meld. This means that if a player can add to a run or a set that is in front of them or any of the other players, they may do so.\n\nFor an existing meld of 3♥-4♥-5♥-6♥, another card of 2♥ or 7♥ can be added, thereby continuing the run in either direction. For an existing meld of 8♥-8♥-8♣-8♠, another card of 8♠ or 8♦ can be added to the set. \n\nThere is no limit in number of additional card a player can add to a run or set in a turn.\n\nAll players sum up their points for the game just ended. The point system is as shown:\n\n\nNote that the lower the points is, the better it is for the player. The player with the lowest point is the winner, while the player with the highest point is the biggest loser. Points can also be optionally recorded, so that they can be summed up at the end of a gaming session to determine overall winner.\n\nA player may substitute a wildcard on table (in a run or set) with a card in his hand, provided the card fits. He can then keep the wildcard for future use.\n\nWildcard Substitution is not counted as an action. So a player must still take one other action of either melding or laying off, after he perform a wildcard substitution, if he has not done so for that turn. \n\nThere is no limit how many wildcard a player can substitute in a turn.\n\nAt the beginning of each game, it is mandatory for a player to play a meld before anything else. This first meld is called a \"passport\". Failing to do so result in an instant \"Dead\", and sitting out for the rest of that game round. There is no point requirement for passport meld, unlike other Rummy rules. A lay-off cannot be used as a passport. In addition, wildcard substitution cannot be carried before a player has a passport.\n\nFailing to obtain a passport is a rare occurrence, given the large number of cards in hand, large number of wildcards, and relatively low requirement of a passport. Player considers oneself to be really unlucky if failing to obtain a passport.\n\nWhen a player can neither meld nor lay-off when it comes to his turn, he has to Declare \"Dead\". The game still goes on for the rest of the players, but he participates no further in the rest of that game. \n\nThe effect is that the player can no longer reduce deadwoods in his hand, and therefore stuck with all the points in the dead hand. Even subsequently when there are new melds that the player could have been able to lay off more cards, he cannot do so because he is out of the game. So it is desirable to delay declaring \"Dead\" as much as possible. In other words, players try real hard to keep his hand alive.\n\nIt is not unusual to see player laying off 3-of-a-kind of Aces in his hand one-by-one, if there is already another existing set of Aces on the table. This helps to keep the hand alive for 3 more rounds. It is also a common strategy not to meld if one does not have to. Melding helps to keep other players alive, which is not desirable for oneself.\n\nIt is worth noting that the most tragic type of \"Dead\" declaration is failing to get a \"passport\" right from the beginning. In other words, the player does not even get a chance to play in that game round.\n\nWhen a player has gotten rid of all of their cards, he declare \"Game\" and wins the hand. This is the same as \"Going Out\" or \"Knocking\" in other Rummy variants. All other players start to total up the points of their deadwoods, which may include any wildcards. They \"cannot\" play on even though they still have melds or lay-offs that they \"can\" play in hand.\n\nA player's attempt to keep his hand alive can backfire badly if another player suddenly declares \"Game\". The biggest satisfaction is to catch your opponent holding several wildcards (therefore high points) in his/her hand when one declares \"Game\".\n\nNote that in Penang Rummy, it is not unusual to have no one declares \"Game\". Instead, many games end up with 4 players declaring \"Dead\". Therefore, the more realistic strategy is to minimise points in your hand when declaring \"Dead\".\n\n"}

The sentence unfolds gradually, so that the thought contained in the subject/verb group only emerges at the sentence's conclusion. Obviously artificial, it is used mostly in what in oratory is called the grand style.\n\nIt is the opposite of the loose sentence, also continuous or running style, where the subject and verb are introduced at the beginning of the sentence. Periodic sentences often rely on hypotaxis, whereas running sentences are typified by parataxis.\n\nCicero is generally considered to be the master of the periodic sentence.\n\nIn English literature, the decline of the periodic sentence's popularity goes hand in hand with the development toward a less formal style, which some authors date to the beginning of the Romantic period, specifically the 1798 publication of the \"Lyrical Ballads\", and the prevalence in twentieth-century literature of spoken language over written language. In American literature, scholars note the explicit rejection by Henry David Thoreau of the formal style of his time, of which the periodic sentence was characteristic; in his journal, Thoreau criticized those sentences as the \"weak and flowing periods of the politician and scholar.\"\n\nAccording to William Harmon, the periodic sentence is used \"to arouse interest and curiosity, to hold an idea in suspense before its final revelation.\" In the words of William Minto, \"the effect...is to keep the mind in a state of uniform or increasing tension until the \"dénouement\".\" \n\nIn his \"Handbook to Literature\", Harmon offers an early example in American literature found in Longfellow’s \"Snowflakes\":\n\nStarting with a succession of parallel adverbial phrases (\"Out of the bosom,\" \"Out of the cloud-folds,\" \"Over the woodlands,\" \"Over the harvest-fields\"), each followed by parallel modification (\"of the air,\" \"of her garment shaken,\" \"brown and bare,\" \"forsaken\"), the sentence is left grammatically incomplete until the subject/verb group \"Descends the snow\".

A particularly long example is the opening stanza (lines 1-22) of Walt Whitman's \"Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking.\"\n\nA \"now-famous periodic sentence\" occurs in Nikolai Gogol's short story \"The Overcoat\":\n\n"}
{"id": "19329865", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19329865", "title": "Short-term effects of alcohol consumption", "text": "Short-term effects of alcohol consumption\n\nThe short-term effects of alcohol (also known formally as ethanol) consumption – due to drinking beer, wine, distilled spirits or other alcoholic beverages – range from a decrease in anxiety and motor skills and euphoria at lower doses to intoxication (drunkenness), stupor, unconsciousness, anterograde amnesia (memory \"blackouts\"), and central nervous system depression at higher doses. Cell membranes are highly permeable to alcohol, so once alcohol is in the bloodstream, it can diffuse into nearly every cell in the body.\n\nThe concentration of alcohol in blood is measured via blood alcohol content (BAC). The amount and circumstances of consumption play a large role in determining the extent of intoxication; for example, eating a heavy meal before alcohol consumption causes alcohol to absorb more slowly. The amount of alcohol consumed largely determines the extent of hangovers, although hydration also plays a role. After excessive drinking, stupor and unconsciousness both can occur. Extreme levels of consumption can cause alcohol poisoning and death; in fact, a concentration in the blood stream of 0.40% will kill half of those affected. Alcohol may also cause death indirectly, by asphyxiation from vomiting.\n\nAlcohol can greatly exacerbate sleep problems. During abstinence, residual disruptions in sleep regularity and sleep patterns are the greatest predictors of relapse.\n\nDifferent concentrations of alcohol in the human body have different effects on the subject.\n\nThe following lists the common effects of alcohol on the body, depending on the blood alcohol concentration (BAC). However, tolerance varies considerably between individuals, as does individual response to a given dosage; the effects of alcohol differ widely between people. Hence, BAC percentages are just estimates used for illustrative purposes.\n\n\n\n\nStudies suggest that a BAC of 0.01–0.04% would slightly lower the risk, referred to as the \"Grand Rapids Effect\" or \"Grand Rapids Dip\", based on a seminal research study by Borkenstein, et al. (Robert Frank Borkenstein is well known for inventing the Drunkometer in 1938, and the breathalyzer in 1954.)\n\nSome literature has attributed the \"Grand Rapids Effect\" to erroneous data or asserted (without support) that it was possibly due to drivers exerting extra caution at low BAC levels or due to \"experience\" in drinking. Other explanations are that this effect is at least in part the blocking effect of ethanol excitotoxicity and the effect of alcohol in essential tremor and other movement disorders, but this remains speculative.\n\nEthanol inhibits the ability of glutamate to open the cation channel associated with the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptors. Stimulated areas include the cortex, hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens, which are all responsible for both thinking and pleasure seeking. Another one of alcohol's agreeable effects is body relaxation, which is possibly caused by neurons transmitting electrical signals in an alpha waves-pattern; such waves are actually observed (with the aid of EEGs) whenever the body is relaxed.\n\nShort-term effects of alcohol include the risk of injuries, violence, and fetal damage. Alcohol has also been linked with lowered inhibitions, although it is unclear as to what degree this is chemical or psychological as studies with placebos can often duplicate the social effects of alcohol at either low or moderate doses. Some studies have suggested that intoxicated people have much greater control over their behavior than is generally recognized, though they have a reduced ability to evaluate the consequences of their behavior. Behavioral changes associated with drunkenness are, to some degree, contextual.\n\nAreas of the brain that are responsible for planning and motor learning are sharpened. A related effect, which is caused by even low levels of alcohol, is the tendency for people to become more animated in speech and movement. This is caused by increased metabolism in areas of the brain associated with movement, such as the nigrostriatal pathway. This causes reward systems in the brain to become more active, which may induce certain individuals to behave in an uncharacteristically loud and cheerful manner.\n\nAlcohol has been known to mitigate the production of antidiuretic hormone, which is a hormone that acts on the kidney to favor water reabsorption in the kidneys during filtration. This occurs because alcohol confuses osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus, which relay osmotic pressure information to the posterior pituitary, the site of antidiuretic hormone release. Alcohol causes the osmoreceptors to signal that there is low osmotic pressure in the blood, which triggers an inhibition of the antidiuretic hormone. As a consequence, one's kidneys are no longer able to reabsorb as much water as they should be absorbing, therefore creating excessive volumes of urine and the subsequent overall dehydration.\n\nAcute alcohol intoxication through excessive doses in general causes short- or long-term health effects. NMDA receptors become unresponsive, slowing areas of the brain for which they are responsible. Contributing to this effect is the activity that alcohol induces in the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system. The GABA system is known to inhibit activity in the brain. GABA could also be responsible for causing the memory impairment that many people experience. It has been asserted that GABA signals interfere with both the \"registration\" and the \"consolidation\" stages of memory formation. As the GABA system is found in the hippocampus (among other areas in the CNS), which is thought to play a large role in memory formation, this is thought to be possible.\n\nAnterograde amnesia, colloquially referred to as \"blacking out\", is another symptom of heavy drinking. This is the loss of memory during and after an episode of drinking. When alcohol is consumed at a rapid rate, the point at which most healthy people's long-term memory creation starts failing usually occurs at approximately 0.20% BAC, but it can be reached as low as 0.14% BAC for inexperienced drinkers.\n\nAnother classic finding of alcohol intoxication is ataxia, in its appendicular, gait, and truncal forms. Appendicular ataxia results in jerky, uncoordinated movements of the limbs, as if each muscle were working independently from the others. Truncal ataxia results in postural instability; gait instability is manifested as a disorderly, wide-based gait with inconsistent foot positioning. Ataxia causes the observation that drunk people are clumsy, sway back and forth, and often fall down. It is presumed to be due to alcohol's effect on the cerebellum.\n\nThe Mellanby effect is the phenomenon that the behavioral impairment due to alcohol is less, at the same BAC, when the BAC is decreasing than when it is increasing. In other words, at a given point on the upward slope of BAC (while drinking), impairment is greater than at a given point on the downward slope (after drinking), even though the BAC is the same at the two points. This effect was confirmed in a 2017 meta-analysis of 26 studies.\n\nHumans metabolize ethanol primarily through NAD-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) class I enzymes (i.e. ADH1A, ADH1B, and ADH1C) to acetaldehyde and then metabolize acetaldehyde primarily by NAD-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) to acetic acid. Eastern Asians reportedly have a deficiency in acetaldehyde metabolism in a surprisingly high percentage (approaching 50%) of their populations. The issue has been most thoroughly investigated in native Japanese where persons with a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variant allele of the ALDH2 gene were found; the variant allele, encodes lysine (lys) instead of glutamic acid (glu) at amino acid 487; this renders the enzyme essentially inactive in metabolizing acetaldehyde to acetic acid. The variant allele is variously termed glu487lys, ALDH2*2, and ALDH2*504lys. In the overall Japanese population, about 57% of individuals are homozygous for the normal allele (sometimes termed ALDH2*1), 40% are heterozygous for glu487lys, and 3% are homozygous for glu487lys. Since ALDH2 assembles and functions as a tetramer and since ALDH2 tetramers containing one or more glu487lys proteins are also essentially inactive (i.e. the variant allele behaves as a dominant negative), homozygote individuals for glu487lys have undetectable while heterozygote individuals for glu487lys have little ALDH2 activity. In consequence, Japanese individuals homozygous or, to only a slightly lesser extent, heterozygous for glu487lys metabolize ethanol to acetaldehyde normally but metabolize acetaldehyde poorly and are susceptible to a set of adverse responses to the ingestion of, and sometimes even the fumes from, ethanol and ethanol-containing beverages; these responses include the transient accumulation of acetaldehyde in blood and tissues; facial flushing (i.e. the \"oriental flushing syndrome\" or Alcohol flush reaction), urticaria, systemic dermatitis, and alcohol-induced respiratory reactions (i.e. rhinitis and, primarily in patients with a history of asthma, mild to moderately bronchoconstriction exacerbations of their asthmatic disease. These allergic reaction-like symptoms, which typically occur within 30–60 minutes of ingesting alcoholic beverages, do not appear to reflect the operation of classical IgE- or T cell-related allergen-induced reactions but rather are due, at least in large part, to the action of acetaldehyde in stimulating tissues to release histamine, the probable evoker of these symptoms.\n\nThe percentages of glu487lys heterozygous plus homozygous genotypes are about 35% in native Caboclo of Brazil, 30% in Chinese, 28% in Koreans, 11% in Thai people, 7% in Malaysians, 3% in natives of India, 3% in Hungarians, and 1% in Filipinos; percentages are essentially 0 in individuals of Native African descent, Caucasians of Western European descent, Turks, Australian Aborigines, Australians of Western European descent, Swedish Lapps, and Alaskan Eskimos. The prevalence of ethanol-induced allergic symptoms in 0 or low levels of glu487lys genotypes commonly ranges above 5%. These \"ethanol reactors\" may have other gene-based abnormalities that cause the accumulation of acetaldehyde following the ingestion of ethanol or ethanol-containing beverages. For example, the surveyed incidence of self-reported ethanol-induced flushing reactions in Scandinavians living in Copenhagen as well as Australians of European descent is about 16% in individuals homozygous for the \"normal\" ADH1B gene but runs to ~23% in individuals with the ADH1-Arg48His SNP variant; in vitro, this variant metabolizes ethanol rapidly and in humans, it is proposed, may form acetaldehyde at levels that exceed the capacity of ALDH2 to metabolize. Notwithstanding such considerations, experts suggest that the large proportion of alcoholic beverage-induced allergic-like symptoms in populations with a low incidence of the glu487lys genotype reflect true allergic reactions to the natural and/or contaminating allergens particularly those in wines and to a lesser extent beers.\n\nModerate alcohol consumption 30–60 minutes before sleep, although decreasing, disrupts sleep architecture. Rebound effects occur once the alcohol has been largely metabolized, causing late night disruptions in sleep maintenance. Under conditions of moderate alcohol consumption where blood alcohol levels average 0.06–0.08 percent and decrease 0.01–0.02 percent per hour, an alcohol clearance rate of 4–5 hours would coincide with disruptions in sleep maintenance in the second half of an 8-hour sleep episode. In terms of sleep architecture, moderate doses of alcohol facilitate \"rebounds\" in rapid eye movement (REM) following suppression in REM and stage 1 sleep in the first half of an 8-hour sleep episode, REM and stage 1 sleep increase well beyond baseline in the second half. Moderate doses of alcohol also very quickly increase slow wave sleep (SWS) in the first half of an 8-hour sleep episode. Enhancements in REM sleep and SWS following moderate alcohol consumption are mediated by reductions in glutamatergic activity by adenosine in the central nervous system. In addition, tolerance to changes in sleep maintenance and sleep architecture develops within 3 days of alcohol consumption before bedtime.\n\nLow doses of alcohol (one beer) appear to increase total sleep time and reduce awakening during the night. The sleep-promoting benefits of alcohol dissipate at moderate and higher doses of alcohol. Previous experience with alcohol also influences the extent to which alcohol positively or negatively affects sleep. Under free-choice conditions, in which subjects chose between drinking alcohol or water, inexperienced drinkers were sedated while experienced drinkers were stimulated following alcohol consumption. In insomniacs, moderate doses of alcohol improve sleep maintenance.\n\nConditions of fatigue correlate positively with increased alcohol consumption. \n\nHormonal imbalance and sleep disruptions following withdrawal from chronic alcohol consumption are strong predictors of relapse. During abstinence, recovering alcoholics have attenuated melatonin secretion at onset of a sleep episode, resulting in prolonged sleep onset latencies. Psychiatry and core body temperatures during the sleep period contribute to poor sleep maintenance. The effect of alcohol consumption on the circadian control of human core body temperature is time dependent.\n\nAlcohol can affect balance by altering the viscosity of the endolymph within the otolithic membrane, the fluid inside the semicircular canals inside the ear. The endolymph surrounds the ampullary cupula which contains hair cells within the semicircular canals. When the head is tilted, the endolymph flows and moves the cupula. The hair cells then bend and send signals to the brain indicating the direction in which the head is tilted. By changing the viscosity of the endolymph to become less dense when alcohol enters the system, the hair cells can move more easily within the ear, which sends the signal to the brain and results in exaggerated and overcompensated movements of body. This can also result in vertigo, or \"the spins.\"\n\nAt low or moderate doses, alcohol acts primarily as a positive allosteric modulator of GABA. Alcohol binds to several different subtypes of GABA, but not to others. The main subtypes responsible for the subjective effects of alcohol are the αβγ, αβγ, αβδ and αβδ subtypes, although other subtypes such as αβγ and αβγ are also affected. Activation of these receptors causes most of the effects of alcohol such as relaxation and relief from anxiety, sedation, ataxia and increase in appetite and lowering of inhibitions that can cause a tendency toward violence in some people.\n\nAlcohol has a powerful effect on glutamate as well. Alcohol decreases glutamate's ability to bind with NMDA and acts as an antagonist of the NMDA receptor, which plays a critical role in LTP by allowing Ca2+ to enter the cell. These inhibitory effects are thought to be responsible for the \"memory blanks\" that can occur at levels as low as 0.03% blood level. In addition, reduced glutamate release in the dorsal hippocampus has been linked to spatial memory loss. Chronic alcohol users experience an upregulation of NMDA receptors because the brain is attempting to reestablish homeostasis. When a chronic alcohol user stops drinking for more than 10 hours, apoptosis can occur due to excitotoxicity. The seizures experienced during alcohol abstinence are thought to be a result of this NMDA upregulation. Alteration of NMDA receptor numbers in chronic alcoholics is likely to be responsible for some of the symptoms seen in delirium tremens during severe alcohol withdrawal, such as delirium and hallucinations. Other targets such as sodium channels can also be affected by high doses of alcohol, and alteration in the numbers of these channels in chronic alcoholics is likely to be responsible for as well as other effects such as cardiac arrhythmia. Other targets that are affected by alcohol include cannabinoid, opioid and dopamine receptors, although it is unclear whether alcohol affects these directly or if they are affected by downstream consequences of the GABA/NMDA effects. People with a family history of alcoholism may exhibit genetic differences in the response of their NMDA glutamate receptors as well as the ratios of GABA subtypes in their brain. Alcohol inhibits sodium-potassium pumps in the cerebellum and this is likely how it corrupts cerebellar computation and body co-ordination.\n\nContrary to popular belief, research suggests that acute exposure to alcohol is not neurotoxic in adults and actually prevents NMDA antagonist-induced neurotoxicity.\n\nAnimal models using mammals and invertebrates have been informative in studying the effects of ethanol on not only pharmacokinetics of alcohol but also pharmacodynamics, in particular in the nervous system. Ethanol-induced intoxication is not uncommon in the animal kingdom, as noted here:\n\nMore recently, studies using animal models have begun to elucidate the effects of ethanol on the nervous system. Traditionally, many studies have been performed in mammals, such as mice, rats, and non-human primates. However, non-mammalian animal models have also been employed; in particular, the Ulrike Heberlein group at UC San Francisco has used \"Drosophila melanogaster\", the fruit fly, taking advantage of its facile genetics to dissect the neural circuits and molecular pathways, upon which ethanol acts. The series of studies carried in the Heberlein lab has identified insulin and its related signaling pathways as well as biogenic amines in the invertebrate nervous system as being important in alcohol tolerance. The value of antabuse (disulfiram) as a treatment for alcoholism has been tested using another invertebrate animal model, the honey bees. It is important to note that some of the analogous biochemical pathways and neural systems have been known to be important in alcohol's effects on humans, while the possibility that others may also be important remains unknown. Research of alcohol's effects on the nervous system remains a hot topic of research, as scientists inch toward understanding the problem of alcohol addiction.\n\nIn addition to the studies carried out in invertebrates, researchers have also used vertebrate animal models to study various effects of ethanol on behaviors.\n\n\n"}

Under the British Empire, imperial units became the official units of measurement and remained so until Sri Lanka adopted the metric system in the 1970s.\n\nVarious units were used in Sri Lanka at different times and some only in certain regions. Some of these remained in use well into the colonial period. The following is only a partial list.\n\nOne covid was equal to 0.464 m (18.5 in). The Bam̆ba (Fathom), still in use as of 2016, is the distance between a man's outstretched arms. It is roughly 6 feet in length. \"Bam̆ba\" is usually used to measure depth in wells and pits. Units used in measuring long distances included the \"Gavuva\", \"Yoduna\", and \"Usaba\" (plurals Gavu and Yodun - a Yoduna was 4 Gavu) and the \"hoo kiyana dura\", which was the audible distance of a shout of 'hoo' by a person. Base of these system of measuring length was the human body.\nKing Nisshankamalla have established milestones called \"Gaavutha Kanu\" from a Gavu to another. Two of such have been found in Katugahagalge and Valigaththa in Southern Province.\n\nThe smallest unit was known as \"Paramaanuwa\", which was equal to 3.3066700127072e-11 m (1.30183858768e-9 in). A typical span was taken roughly equal to 22.86 cm (9 in). These small units of measurement were used in making of statues and buildings. Following are the relationships between the units used in ancient times.\nMeasurements of area used in ancient Sri Lanka was a system derived from paddy agriculture. Area was often measured in terms of the land that could be sown with a specific amount of seed or rice, including the Pǣla, Amuna, Kiriya (4 amunas), and the Riyana. In one region, a Kiriya was about 8 acres. Following are relationships between some typical measures of area.\n\nIn an stone inscription written by King Bhathikabhaya Abhaya at Dunumadalakanda in Anuradhapura District, it is stated that he offered a land of 1 Kareesa to a temple in the area. In another stone inscription written by King Kutakannabhaya Thissa at Horiwila in Anuradhapura District, it is stated that he offered a land of 8 Kareesa to a temple named 'Thissa' in the area.\n\nJames Prinsep, writing in 1840, stated that \"at ... Ceylon ... English measures only are used, or at least a cubit based on the English measure of 18 inches.\"\n\nOne candy, or one bahar, was equal to 226.8 kg, or 500 lbs, or according to \"The Indian Trader's Guide\" 480 Dutch pounds or 520 pounds Avoirdupois. Small weights could be measured in seeds, such as the Thala (Sesame), Amu, Vee (Rice) (3 Amu), Madati (8 Vee), Majadi, Maditi, Kalanda, and Manjadi. In ancient times, there have been an accurate system to measure weights. Following are some such weight measuring units used. Units like Madati ( \"Adenanthera pavonina\" ), Vee (Rice) are based on weights of those seeds.\n\nIt is stated that frauds in weighing was a punishable offence and only weights approved by the government should be used in weighing, in Sorabora Wewa Pillar Inscription (Badulla Pillar Inscription) which was written by King Udaya IV.\n\nDifferent units were used for liquid and dry capacity.\n\nOne seer was equal to 1.2 quarts and one parrah was equal to 6.75 gallons. Another source suggests that a seer was equal to 1.86 imperial pints or 1.06 litres. These were mostly introduced in the period which coastal areas were governed by Portuguese and Dutch.\n\nUnits to measure dry capacities were mainly used in agriculture. Some of them are as following:\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> capacity of Kuruni varies from area to area\n\nOne ammonam was equal to 203.4 l. One parrah = 1/8 ammonam, oneseer = 1/288 ammonam and the chundoo was equal to nearly half a pint.\n\nMaccauly stated in 1818 that to the north of Colombo an \"Ammonam\" contained 16 \"Parahs\", and 2.5 \"Ammonams\" equalled one \"Acre\", but that to the south there were 8 \"Parahs\" to the \"Ammonam\". He describes the \"Parah\" as a measure 16.7 inches wide and 5.6 inches deep.\n\nMontgomery, writing in 1835, described the interior measurement of a \"Parrah\" as a perfect cube of 11.571 inches, and the seer as a cylinder of depth 4.35 inches and diameter 4.35 inches.\n\n"}
{"id": "7518360", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7518360", "title": "Street-level bureaucracy", "text": "Street-level bureaucracy\n\nStreet-level bureaucracy is the subset of a public agency or government institution where the civil servants work who have direct contact with members of the general public. Street-level civil servants carry out and/or enforce the actions required by a government's laws and public policies, in areas ranging from safety and security to education and social services. A few examples include police officers, border guards, social workers and public school teachers. These civil servants have direct contact with members of the general public, in contrast with civil servants who do policy analysis or economic analysis, who do not meet the public. Street-level bureaucrats act as liaisons between government policy-makers and citizens and these civil servants implement policy decisions made by senior officials in the public service and/or by elected officials.\n\nStreet-level bureaucrats interact and communicate with the general public, either in person (as with a police officer doing a random checkpoint to check for drunk driving or a civil servant in a department of transportation who helps people to register a newly purchased car and provide them with licence plates); over the phone (as with a government call center, where civil servants answer phone calls from people who are applying for or receiving unemployment insurance); or, in jurisdictions which have implemented electronic government technologies, via the Internet (e.g., a person finding out about the government's taxation laws by going onto the taxation department's official website and asking questions to a civil servant via email).\n\nStreet-level bureaucrats often have some degree of discretion on how they enforce the rules, laws and policies which they are assigned to uphold. For example, a police officer who catches a speeding motorist typically can decide whether to give the driver a warning or apply a penalty such as a fine or criminal charge; a border guard who finds undeclared rum in a border-crossing motorist's car trunk can either give the person a warning, confiscate and destroy the contraband item, or levy a fine or other penalty; a government social worker who meets with an unemployed person can decide whether or not to provide social assistance or unemployment insurance benefits; and a high school principal who finds that a student is skipping school can decide whether or not to suspend the person, taking into account the student's unique circumstances and situation. Even though front-line bureaucrats have this degree of discretion, they typically must operate within the rule of law, the system of government regulations, laws and administrative procedural rules. These regulations, laws and rules help to ensure that the street-level bureaucracy operates fairly and ethically, and that each citizen is treated fairly.\n\nThe concept of street-level bureaucracy was first coined by Michael Lipsky in 1969(), who argued that \"policy implementation in the end comes down to the people [(the street-level bureaucrats)] who actually implement it\". However, the process of street-level bureaucracy has been around for a much longer period. A \"government will be better accepted if its administrators [e.g., bureaucrats] reflect the origins [and needs] of its people\", an ideal which embodies the goals of an effective street-level bureaucracy in America. Some of the first street-level bureaucrats in the US were post office officials and administrators. The presidency of Woodrow Wilson helped to spur a large growth in public administration and government policy-making, which in turn led to larger-sized and better-funded street-level bureaucracies. However it was not until the 1950s with the baby boom that street level bureaucracy became as strong as a presence in society as it is in the 2000s.\n\nLipsky describes street level bureaucrats as the \"human face\" of policy, since these individuals interact directly with citizens. The history of street-level bureaucracy follows the history of policy development and the scope of government in America, with areas with larger populations and more government policies employing more public servants (e.g., Chicago which employs 26,680 teachers).() Due to street-level bureaucrats' close interactions with citizens, day-to-day application of discretion in their assessment of people's cases and issues, and their role as policy interpreters, Lipsky claims that \"in a sense the street-level bureaucrats implicitly mediate aspects of the constitutional relationship of citizens to the state. In short, they hold the keys to a dimension of citizenship.\"() The interpretation of the duties, scope, and responsibilities of street-level bureaucrats are still debated in the 2000s, with ongoing discussion on the roles of discretion, accountability, lack of resources, and technology and concerns raised about the risks of corruption.\n\nWhere there is population growth, there is usually growth in demand for these occupations, because there are more citizens who need public services. The demand for these occupations will vary by region but generally, the job outlook in these careers is on the rise in many countries and/or regions where there is an increase in population.\n\nIn the United States' education sector there is a strong demand for teachers in numerous regions across the country. There are currently fifty-one \"hot spots\" with a demand for educators in these regions. Amongst these fifty-one hot spots, five of the regions are with an incredible need for educators in both the primary and secondary education sector. The areas of desperate need include: Las Vegas, Nevada; the Northern region of Oklahoma; Kansas City, Missouri; the Central region of Arkansas; and the Western region of Mississippi.\n\nThe demand for police officers is another occupation that will experience growth over the next ten years. Because urbanized and metropolitan regions are amongst the fastest growing in the United States, that is generally where the demand for these individuals will be.\n\nFirefighters are another case in protective services where an increase in demand is expected over the next decade. A seven percent increase in career outlook is to be expected by the year 2022.\n\nThe demand for social workers has an average growth rate in the United States. With a general population increase social workers are needed in all areas of the career field. The demand for social workers is extremely high. The national average for growth in all careers stands at eleven percent, while a projected nineteen percent increase in social work is needed to fulfill the sectors responsibility to the general public.\n\nCorruption in street-level bureaucracy is a violation of the ethical codes of conduct, laws and regulations that have been established by the government and its agencies. An example of corruption would be cases where a police officer or border guard accepted a bribe from a member of the public in return for not enforcing a law or regulation. There are many agencies which define and interpret what is acceptable ethical behavior and what is not. Violation of these rules or ethical codes of conduct by street-level bureaucrats has repercussions that effect not only the person or agency involved, but also the general public that these street-level bureaucracies serve. Neutrality and impartiality in following policies and procedures is what is expected and most remain separate from person feelings or views. Here is a link to a social work case that let personal feelings override there ethical responsibility.\n\nAnother example for corruption in street-level bureaucracy are black market payments for doctors and nurses, as part of the shadow economy. The term \"black market medicine\" refers to a variety of illegal actions that individuals take in order to obtain healthcare services for themselves. Such actions include direct payments to doctors in government hospitals to improve one's position on the waiting list (especially for surgeries) or payments to doctors so they will treat the patient personally. \n\nAccountability is the means by which these codes are upheld and to ensure moral and ethical practices within these bureaucratic agencies. There is much debate over the methodology of how exactly these agencies should be held accountable. Accountability is divided into five categories: transparency, liability, controllability, responsibility, and responsiveness.\n\nTwo major accountability processes are compliance based and performance based. \"Traditionally, accountability has involved defining rules and procedures and then employing various means to ensure compliance with these expectations\" Performance-based practices rely on standardized processes that measure performance in terms of output and results. Yet compliance based, and performance based accountability has limitations for measuring the efficiency, effectiveness, equity, and economy of the bureaucracy. Furthermore, accountability stems from a multidimensional perspective, which includes the general public the bureaucracy serves, peers and co-workers, office managers, public administrators, and elected officials.\n\nDiscretion can be defined as a component in the decision making process that determines an individual's action or non-action. Carrington divides discretion into two major components as the freedom the decision maker has to choose between different actions; and the decision to act or not act through the rules and judgment of the decision maker. Michael Lipsky states street level bureaucrats have discretion because human judgment is in the nature of service work that machines could not replace. Street level bureaucrats are responsible for making appropriate decisions that are appropriate for clients and their situations. Lipsky states all street level bureaucrats will confront situations in which they need to depart from service ideals in order to cope with both expectations from their jobs and the public ideals. \n\nAccording to Lipsky, the exercise of discretion among street level bureaucrats is critical in how public servants interact with citizens on a daily basis. He claims to understand these acts of discretion once must analyze the outcome of agency performance the public experiences as a combined result of agency rules and street level bureaucrats responses to unsanctioned work. Lipsky said the use of discretion by street level bureaucrats can’t be removed from everyday practice due to the complexity and uncertainty of human service work. Carrington identifies the fear of power abuse as a major reason for the opposition of discretion in the arena of street level bureaucrats and its citizens. In order to control problems in discretionary action there has been a demand for control by understanding the social situations in which discretion varies. Marissa Kelly also examines the use of discretion among street level bureaucrats to assert that discretion can either enhance or inhibit street level bureaucrats’ implementation of justice. She asserts that whether discretion is appropriate or not justice theories need to be further examined.\n\nLipsky concludes that the lack of resources causes street level bureaucrat to develop simplified routines for processing cases that influence their everyday tasks. These routines for decisionmaking affect public policy. He states that street level bureaucrats are taught implementation skills instead of learning about how to find more resources, knowledge and information that would help them to implement policies more effectively. Hill identifies several implementation resources street level bureaucrats often lack such as; research resources, appropriate resources on how to shape specific policies for their specific situation, and access to expertise and skills training to better their decision-making and awareness in specific challenging situations that arise at the street level. Another key resource that front-line bureaucrats often lack is time to fully assess individual cases. In social services, social workers often have such a large caseload that they can only see social assistance recipients or applicants for a very short time each week. As a result, social workers have to make very rapid decisions as to whether to approve or deny welfare benefits.\n\nTechnological advances such as the widespread availability of the Internet and online databases have had a major impact on street-level bureaucracy and the front-line civil servants who provide services to citizens. There are two major theories on how technology has impacted this sector: curtailment theory and enablement theory. Curtailment theory holds that increasing technological advances hinder street-level bureaucrats and their ability to perform effectively; especially concerning their ability to exercise discretion on complex cases. Enablement theory holds that increasing technological advances, at best, empower the existing abilities of the street-level bureaucrat and better inform the citizen. At worst, the effects of technology are ambiguous.\n\nIt was first argued by Snellen that increasing technological advances (ITA) \"deeply challeng[e] [the street-level bureaucrat's] ability to manipulate information.\" Snellen believed it was the ability to manipulate information that gave the SLB's their power. He further argued that as more decisions are made by computers or software, SLB's will lose their discretionary powers and they will shift to other actors. For example, in the 2010, some government organizations use online application forms for programs in which the computer program, rather than a human front-line bureaucrat, will reject applications which are incomplete. In a pre-technological advances era, a front-line bureaucrat might have used his or her discretion over decisions to allow an application in which some of the information requests are not completed (e.g., due to urgent need on the part of the citizen or the existence of an emergency situation). For example, in the 1960s and 1970s, if a social worker received a hand-written, pen-and-paper application from a homeless person for social assistance, the bureaucrat might approve the application even if the applicant did not have a street address or the required identification documents, to ensure that the applicant remained housed and safe.\nHowever, there are four problems with this thesis. First, it is implied, but never proven, that with the arrival of more technology, discretion at the frontline will diminish or become non-existent. Second, Snellen's definition of the SLB's source of power is too narrow and does not take into account other sources of discretion. Third, this thesis only pertains to particular public organizations and does not apply to more common types of street-level bureaucracies such as police departments, schools, or social welfare departments. Lastly, this theory does not take into account how SLB's and other caseworkers actually utilize this new technology and how that might affect their performance.\n\nIn contrast to the curtailment theory, a 2007 study by Jorna and Wagenaar showed that ITA was able to increase the amount of work done while cutting down on inconsistencies. However, the meaning and content of this work was not able to be captured and understood by ITA. A 2004 study by Vitalis and Duhaut \nhighlighted the ambiguous nature of ITA. It was shown that the Internet or other forms of technology were utilized for simpler tasks, and more elaborate and complex matters were dealt with face-to-face with citizens. Vitalis and Duhaut come to the conclusion that a SLB has their discretionary power enhanced by ITA, and citizens benefit from ITA by being better informed of their rights when dealing with SLBs and \ntheir institutions. This theory maintains that discretion by the SLB is not hindered in anyway by ITA and will continue to do their jobs effectively. This theory also focuses more on how ITA is utilized by both citizens and state agents which puts more emphasis on the ability of ITA to further help and empower SLBs and citizens.\n\n\n"}

This traditional cloth is hand-woven made of \"Abaca\" fibers which traditionally has three primary colors, red, black and the original color of the Abaca leaves. The colorant of the materials are naturally dyed boiled in with bark, roots and leaves of plants. It is an heritage and believed that the intricate and creative patterns of the Tinalak was seen on their dreams and made it on to work.

It is ever present in significant turning points in a [Tboli] life, such as birth, marriage, and death. It is the medium which sanctifies these rites, enveloping them in the length of its fabric like a benediction. It has also often been referred to as “woven dreams”. It is exactly that, and more.

After a weaver reaches a certain degree of expertise, she becomes a “master weaver” – someone who can interpret and take inspiration from dreams, hence the term “dreamweavers”. By all accounts, this seems to be an intense personal experience for the weaver, and the moment she succeeds in doing this is the moment she becomes an artist. And then it is also social because the T’nalak binds together all that the [T’boli]people believe in. The skill of the weaver gathers in the T’nalak all the elements that make the [T’boli] social life.

{"id": "60171", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60171", "title": "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre", "text": "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\n\nThe Treasure of the Sierra Madre (originally titled Der Schatz der Sierra Madre) is a 1927 adventure novel by bilingual German author B. Traven, whose identity remains unknown., In the book, two destitute American men in Mexico of the 1920s join an older American prospector in a search for gold. John Huston adapted the book as a 1948 film of the same name.\n\nThe novel is set in the decade following the global upheavals of the First World War and social revolutions in Russia and Mexico. The United States has emerged as the dominant imperialist power globally. European and US corporations are aggressively seeking foreign markets, natural resources and cheap labor. Elements within the Catholic Church are struggling to retain their authority as liberal Mexican administrations institute social reforms, including an 8-hour day, literacy programs and health care. This is the context of the story.\n\nThe author employs a third person-omniscient in a dramatic-progressive structure, where Howard is the focal character. Three stories within a story provide historical and social significance for the outer narrative.\n\nThe story opens in the oil boomtown of Tampico, Mexico in the early 1920s. Dobbs, an expatriate who hails from “an industrial American city” is unemployed, penniless and reduced to bumming spare change from American tourists. Loitering on Tampico's main plaza, he collects a number of generous handouts from well-to-do men who wear white suits. To Dobbs’ dismay, he discovers that he has been accosting the same individual repeatedly. The irate tourist at last unbraids the panhandler, dismissing him with a half-peso tip.\n\nAt the \"Hotel Oso Negro\" (the Black Bear Hotel), a vermin-infested flophouse, Dobbs pays for a cot and a cold shower at 50 centavos per night. The hotel clientele comprises both employed and unemployed international workers, as well as a number of gamblers, thieves and tramps. The \"Oso Negro\", nevertheless, is operated efficiently by its sharp-eyed front desk clerks. The guests themselves collectively provide a degree of good order and security.\n\nIn a café, a young Mexican lottery vendor exhorts Dobbs to purchase a ticket. Dobbs insults the boy, but finally consents to risk his last 20 centavos on the drawing.\n\nDobbs lands a gig unloading agricultural machinery at four pesos per day. Desperate for better wages, he joins a rigging crew as a roughneck, run by American contractor Pat McCormick. A shrewd bidder on lucrative drilling projects, McCormick has a reputation for fast-paced operations and high productivity. He postures as an anti-capitalist and comrade to revolutionaries so as to win the loyalty of his newly arrived European laborers, who are sympathetic to Bolshevism. Americans are wise to his phony appeals to worker solidarity and McCormick avoids hiring them. The pay is $8 a day, less $1.80 for meals. The crews work 18-hour shifts, seven days a week for the duration of the project and no overtime pay. Mexican labor is never hired due to their national eight-hour day provision. When the rigging job is completed, the crew is sent back to Tampico to await payment. McCormick advances a few employees 5% of their pay. Dobbs argues for and gets 30% of his earning in cash. \n\nWeeks pass while Dobbs, along with Californian co-worker named Curtin seek the evasive contractor. The men spot McCormick in the central plaza, promenading with his meretricious mistress. When they confront him, he invites the resentful Dobbs and Curtin into a \"cantina\" for a drink. Plying the men with liquor, McCormick pleads that he has not yet been reimbursed by the oil company. Curtin curses his lie, while Dobbs thrusts him against the bar, demanding their wages. McCormick, himself a brawler, and capable of beating up the men one-on-one, mentally calculates his losses if he ends up in a hospital after a desperate bar fight against both determined workers. He pulls out the cash he owes Dobbs and Curtin and throws it on the bar top. Vowing to never hire them again, he strides out of the \"cantina\".\n\nWhen Dobbs returns to the \"Oso Negro\", he encounters the greying Howard, an old-timer who has travelled the world in search of gold. The loquacious old man is holding forth with his bunkmates on the perils of striking it rich. Discovered in quantity, he avers, gold distorts a man's estimate of vice and virtue. Invariably he succumbs to greed, and no amount of gold will satisfy him. Overhearing this, Dobbs becomes agitated, swearing that he is immune to the sinister forces of gold, that he would be happy with a $20,000 fortune, no more. Howard quietly takes the measure of Dobbs with a long look, then returns to his sermon. He assures them that, though no longer in his prime, he is ready to share expenses on a gold-prospecting expedition. Dobbs and the others feel the powerful lure of the precious metal.\n\nDobbs shares the legend of the Green Water Mine with Curtin, and has a premonition that he may be subject to a gold curse. Curtin discounts any “curse” associated with gold and holds that a person's character determines its effects; it may be used for bad or good.\n\nWith many oil fields beginning to shut down operation in Mexico and relocate to other countries, the two men are impelled to partner with Howard to seek gold. Curtin is skeptical as to the old man's fitness, but Dobbs assures him that Howard is indispensable to the success of their venture, wondering if the old timer will even entertain shouldering two greenhorn prospectors. Howard gladly consents, and offers to invest the bulk of his savings, $200, towards the endeavor. Dobbs discovers that his lottery ticket has netted 100 pesos, and Curtin, in turn, collects an outstanding loan repayment with interest to the amount of $200. With about $600 in pooled funds, the trio depart immediately by train for city of Durango, in the Mexican interior.\n\nIn Durango, Howard selects a promising region in the remote Sierra Madre Mountains to search for gold. Purchasing supplies and pack animals in local villages they begin their ascent. Dobbs and Curtin are staggered by the hardships they experience in wilderness travel. Several promising sites are tested, but show only traces of gold. The two inexperienced men begin to despair and consider quitting.\n\nHoward suddenly begins to berate his companions, disparaging their pessimism and ignorance. The old man's outburst is such that Dobbs and Curtin suspect he has gone mad. Listening to him, they begin to grasp what he is saying: the keen-eyed miner recognizes that the terrain is laden with placer gold.\n\nAn excavation site is selected and the base camp is situated over a mile away for security. The men intend to pose as professional game hunters seeking commercial hides. The approach to the diggings are carefully camouflaged with boulders and trunks. The local people take little interest in their activities and do not molest them. They establish a placer gold operation, using a sluice box, with the water hauled to the apparatus by burros from a nearby creek. Driven by entrepreneurial self-interest, Dobbs and Curtin work to the limits of their endurance. The gold accumulates slowly but surely.\n\nAs the fortune piles up, the prospectors class identity shifts. With property to defend, they adopt a bourgeois outlook, suspicious of the have-nots. They cease to be proletariats. Even as the men share the same hardships, they do not forge friendships, merely alliances for profit. Their willingness to rescue a partner in distress is self-serving: the loss of one man to death or injury could cripple the profitable enterprise.\nMonths of hard labor and privations in the wilderness begins to show on the men. They are sick of the grub, the monotony of the work regimen and, especially, of one another. Howard has constantly to intervene to diffuse fights between the younger men. In a number of violent confrontations, they pull their pistols and come close to shooting each other over trifles.\n\nThe miners begin to anticipate the end of the operation and a return to civil society. Curtin raises the question as to how much each gold share will bring in cash. Howard calculates this to be about $15,000 apiece. The claim is beginning to show signs of depletion and the men set a date of departure of 6-8 weeks. They collaborate in planning the safe transportation and conversion of their riches to currency. For the first time in months, they begin to think of their personal futures.\n\nCurtin makes a final resupply trip to the local village. He takes a few hides at usual to sell at the dry goods store; this, to keep up the pretense he is a hunter. Curtin is accosted by a friendly American newcomer visiting the store. The man insinuates that there is much gold in the nearby mountains; Curtin emphatically denies it. The stranger guesses the significance of Curtin's aloofness and trails him into the mountain wilderness.\n\nWithout warning, the intruder steps silently into their fire circle. The prospectors are momentarily taken off guard by his arrival. Dobbs recovers, and emphatically tells the man to clear out, but the stranger stands his ground. The miners cunningly ignore the unwelcome guest, and pretend to discuss “hunting” strategies. The stranger bluntly informs them the area is unfit for commercial hunting – rather, they are sitting on a gold field. The prospectors return to their tent intensely suspicious of the man's purpose. They permit him to stay the night. The stranger introduces himself as Robert W. Lacuad of Phoenix, Arizona, “Tech, Pasadena”. \n\nWhen Howard goes to check the burros, he spots mounted men in the distance approaching the encampment. They are not Mexican soldiers or police. Lacuad warns the miners that the horsemen are dangerous bandits, led by the notorious Gold Hat. Tipped off by locals, they are searching for the “hunter” (Curtin) to seize his guns and ammunition. Lacuad assures his companions that their lives are in imminent danger. As they anxiously watch the bandits slowly ascend the trail, Lacuad relates to them the story of Gold Hat, conveyed to him by a local nobleman, don Genaro Montereal, while visiting his estate the previous week.\n\nThe prospectors take up positions in a trench-like ravine with a view of the campsite, fortifying it like a military bunker. Howard assumes command with the consent of the others and holds a war council.\n\nGold Hat and his men dismount and enter the campsite on foot, expecting to encounter only a lone hunter. Failing to find him, they quarrel and consider returning to the village. The prospectors silently observe these developments from their hidden defenses. As the 20-man bandit group prepare to spend the night, one member explores the vicinity and discovers Curtin in the trench. Curtin warns him away, and the bandit alerts his companions.\nGold Hat approaches Curtin and identifies his cohorts as \"policia montada\" (mounted police), searching for outlaws who robbed a train. Curtin in turn demands that they show their police badges. Gold Hat, affronted, threatens Curtin with arrest for hunting without a license and possessing unregistered firearms. Curtin brandishes his rifle and the bandits determine to lay siege to his foxhole; they prefer to take him alive so as to torture him to death for entertainment. The methods they will use matches the iconography of Catholic Church and the practice of torture by the Inquisition. The bandits wear the icons of the Virgin Mary and Saint Joseph, believing they will protect them in their endeavors.\n\nGold Hat tries to lure Curtin from his foxhole with promises of a gold watch. Rebutted, the outlaws construct movable barriers to assault the trench. Before they can deploy them, a company of genuine mounted police, alerted by villagers, appear and pursue Gold Hat and his gang as they flee the encampment.\n\nWith the ordeal over, Howard, Dobbs and Curtin express a desire to terminate operations and return immediately to civilization, Howard confides to Dobbs and Curtin that Lacuad is an eccentric “eternal” – a prospector who becomes obsessed over a coveted diggings and will not abandoned even after decades of failure. They leave him to his fate. Howard directs the dismantling of their mine so as to leave no trace of its existence. Howard warns his cohorts that the next phase – transferring the gold dust back to civilization – may be the riskiest phase and they become preoccupied with its challenges. Howard illustrates these dangers in his tale of the Dona Maria Mine.\n\nHoward, Curtin and Dobbs take leave of Lacuad and head for Durango. The threesome avoid populated areas and refrain from acting suspicious so as not to draw attention from locals. Passing through a tiny village, they are detained by Mexican officials. Expecting the worst – that they will be fined for operating an unregistered mine – the officials turn out to be medical technicians for the Health Commission vaccinating the residents for smallpox. The prospectors gladly submit to be inoculated and go their way.\n\nSetting up camp, they are intercepted by a delegation of mounted \"indios\". The farmers request that the American accompany them to their village: the son of one of the men has been pulled from a swimming hole unconscious and cannot be revived. Howard consents to accompany them to their village and examine the boy. There, he applies basic First Aid to the child and he recovers. The villagers regard Howard's powers as those of a medicine-man or magician.\n\nHoward rejoins Dobbs and Curtin and they resume their journey, but they are shortly overtaken by the father of the boy he saved. The man and his companions insist that Howard return to the village so they can pay back the debt – a matter of etiquette and honor. The prospectors recognize that the \"indios\" are in earnest, and Howard relents. He relinquishes his possessions - including his share of gold - to the care of Dobbs and Curtin. They promise to rendezvous with him in Durango. Howard is welcome as a hero by the villagers upon his return.\n\nDobbs and Curtin, struggling to cross the high Sierra Madre, begin to quarrel in the absence of the Howard's steadying influence. Dobbs, regretting having agreed to transport Howard's gear, lashes out at Curtin. Curtin maintains his composure and shoulders most of the work. Despite this, the unstable Dobbs descends into a homicidal rage, which Curtin, though anxious, is slow to grasp. When Dobbs proposes that they abscond with Howard's share, Curtin flatly vetoes the notion. Dobbs reacts to his comrade's defense of Howard as a symptom of Bolshevism. Curtin does not deny being a socialist, but emphatically refuses to betray the old man. Though not above some unscrupulousness himself, his actions are directed toward those who have power and wealth, not against his companions. When Dobbs pulls his pistol, Curtin is thunderstruck; he realizes that Dobbs is a homicidal maniac. Curtin manages to disarm Dobbs, but cannot, on principle, bring himself to kill an unarmed man. Dobbs’ hatred and contempt for Curtin deepens when he interprets this restraint as “Bolshevik” in character.\nThe unarmed Dobbs bides his time in the ensuing days, taunting his bewildered companion. Curtin is forced to remain awake at night to fend off an assault by Dobbs. Exhausted, he finally slips into sleep. Dobbs instantly seizes his pistol and marches Curtin into the underbrush where he shoots him point blank. Returning minutes later to make sure the man is dead, he shoots into the prostrate body a second time.\n\nIn an attempt to rationalize his crime, Dobbs recalls that he killed German soldiers in combat serving in the US military in Europe. His conscience troubles him, but he finally falls into a deep sleep. He awakes and searches for Curtin's body, but cannot find it. He begins to hallucinate as his alienation and guilt take hold of him.\n\nHe departs camp and makes good progress towards Durango, in possession of all the gold. When he spots a locomotive in the distant valley, his anxiety fades and he contemplates a trip to the British Isles, the home of his ancestors. His only concern is that his crime will be discovered before he can cash in and escape. In sight of Durango, he is reassured that the law and order that protects property in civilized areas will assert itself. Dobbs gloats over his presumed killing of Curtin and his double-dealing of Howard.\n\nOn the outskirts of Durango, Dobbs and his pack train stumble onto three Mestizo desperados – Miguel, Nacho and Pablo - at a secluded site off the main road. Dobbs senses his life is in danger. The Mestizos begin to ransack the packs. Dobbs pulls his pistol, only to find it is unloaded. Miguel, the leader of the gang, quickly dispatches Dobbs with a machete. The men don his clothing, and escape with the pack train.\n\nThe outlaws, upon examining the contents of the pack, find only what appears to be sand in burlap bags. They guess that this is ballast placed in the packs to inflate the value by weight of commercial hides, or perhaps samples taken by a mining company engineer. They cannot fathom that it could be a fortune in placer gold. Frustrated at the paucity of loot, they slash the bags and contents pour out, swept away by the wind.\n\nThe desperados travel to a tiny village in the high Sierra Madre and offer the stolen burros for sale. The village elders casually examine the animals and the men's outfits. The brands on the burros are recognized as those sold to three prospectors months before. The village mayor is sent for; he engages the three Mestizos in an unassuming, yet probing interrogation regarding their acquisition of the burros and packs. The thieves are equivocal. The mayor quietly assembles the men of the village. After further cross-examination and more inconsistences in the scenario, a posse is sent to locate Dobbs and discover his decapitated remains. The local military garrison is notified, and a captain arrives with a platoon of troopers to take the Mestizos into custody. While being marched back to the garrison, the accused murderers are shot to death while trying to “escape”. Their corpses are buried where they fell, with a cynical display of decorum.\n\nCurtin, wounded and barely alive, is found crawling through the underbrush by a local woodsman. He takes Curtin to his home, and Howard is notified that a gringo needs medical care. When Howard arrives, Curtin relates his ordeal with Dobbs, and swears revenge. Howard, reflecting on the incident, and without exonerating Dobbs, does not consider him a natural killer. The old timer points to the temptation of $50,000 in gold, and declares that any person might be tempted to murder for it. The two men agree to pursue Dobbs and retrieve their fortunes – not yet knowing Dobbs’ fate.\n\nWhile Curtin convalesces, Howard embarks for Durango, but he is intercepted by the mayor who presided over the interrogation of Dobbs’ murderers and tells him the story. Howard is informed that the gold has been lost. He returns to his village and relates the tragic news to Curtin. Grasping the enormity of the disaster, Howard roars with “Homeric” laughter. Curtin is at first offended, distraught at the loss of the fortune, but finally joins the old prospector in his ironic mirth.\n\nHoward is content to remain in the village as a medicine-man and offer Curtin to accompany him as an apprentice doctor. When Howard makes a thorough examination of the recovered burros and packs, he finds two bags of placer gold overlooked by the thieves. Now possessing some capital, the two ex-prospectors consider opening a movie theatre or a grocery store in Tampico, but with the decline in the oil boom, they doubt their profitability. \n\nHoward remains enthusiastic about a life as an honored member of the Indio community. Curtin bids Howard farewell, and promises to visit his old comrade when he fully recovers.\n\n\n\n\n\"Gold Hat\" (portrayed by Alfonso Bedoya)'s line to Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) - \"I don't have to show you any stinkin' badges!\" - is a well-known and widely quoted (and often misquoted) line from the book and 1948 film. (See Stinking badges.)\n"}

Müller held a professorial degree and compiled the most popular English–Russian dictionary, which saw numerous reeditions (some containing about 70,000 words and expressions). Müller was also an expert on medieval dramaturgy, particularly on William Shakespeare. He published \"The Drama and Theatre of Shakespear's Epoch\" (1925) and lectured Shakespeariana to Dmitry Likhachov.\n\nMüller was born in Moscow, his father was a Baltic German from Riga. Upon graduation from Moscow State University, Müller continued studies in Oxford and London. In 1918, Müller became a Professor and lectured at various institutions. He was described as \"sincere opponent of German militarism\" by his student and noted scholar Igor Diakonov. Around 1915 Müller married Aleksandra Petrovna Gneusheva. In the 1920s Müller wrote multiple articles on English literature for \"Granat Encyclopedic Dictionary\", \"Great Soviet Encyclopedia\" and \"Literature Encyclopedia\". According to Diakonov, Müller saw the cause of transition from Old English to Middle English and the loss of external grammatical flexion in the plague epidemic of the 14th century. In 1926 Müller moved with his wife to Saint Petersburg. In the following year he began working on English dictionaries, together with Semyon Boyanus.\n\nThe exact date of Müller's death is unknown. It is believed that both Vladimir Müller and his wife died during the siege of Leningrad in 1941. Müller's wife was an art scholar and worked in the National Library of Russia.\n"}

In the 1990s, it was popularized by commercial publications released by shopping centers in Chiba, Japan. In 2010, water marble nail art was adapted to use acrylic artificial nails and gels.\n\nThe water marble nail technique has gained popularity across the globe through features in magazines, websites, polish makers and videos.\n\nThere are two main types of water marble nail art methods: free-dragging and free-dropping. Free-dragging is more common.\n\nDragged patterns range from simple circular shapes to complicated drawings. Patterns such as marble, hearts/peacocks, animals, flowers, leaves, parallel lines, psychedelics, spiderwebs, and random patterns in the style of designer Emilio Pucci are generally performed with nail lacquers and some kind of tool.\n\nDropped patterns range from colored shapes to complicated drawings such as spirals and geometric designs. The free patterns are created by colored drops of nail lacquer. For free-dropping, lacquer colors are dropped straight or diagonally onto the water. The pattern floats on the surface of the water.\n\nWater marble nail art requires clean water, nail lacquers for free-dropping, and a stick for drawing patterns. Before patterns are created, the nails are painted with a light-colored nail polish that establishes a good contrast with the colors chosen to create the water marble. Some techniques use a matte coat to provide contrast and maintain an even look.\n\nAfter the base coat has dried, tape is put around the fingers to gather the excess nail polish after the marbling. One or two drops of colored lacquer are chosen for the design and are added to a cup of clean water. The drops will create a circle on the water surface. The next color is added on top of the circle created by the previous drop. The resulting pattern is ready for application to the nail, but it can still be modified with a stick or toothpick to create different shapes. The nail is dipped into the pattern on the water and kept under water as a Q-tip is used to \"grab\" the remaining polish.\n"}
