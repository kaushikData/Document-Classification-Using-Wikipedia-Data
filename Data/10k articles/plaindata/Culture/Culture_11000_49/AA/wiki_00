{"id": "1597970", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1597970", "title": "An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races", "text": "An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races\n\nEssai sur l'inégalité des races humaines (Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races, 1853–1855) is the infamous work of French writer Joseph Arthur, Comte de Gobineau, which argues that there are differences between human races, that civilizations decline and fall when the races are mixed and that the white race is superior. It is today considered to be one of the earliest examples of scientific racism.\n\nExpanding upon Boulainvilliers' use of ethnography to defend the Ancien Régime against the claims of the Third Estate, Gobineau aimed for an explanatory system universal in scope: namely, that race is \"the\" primary force determining world events. Using scientific disciplines as varied as linguistics and anthropology, Gobineau divides the human species into three major groupings, white, yellow and black, claiming to demonstrate that \"history springs only from contact with the white races.\" Among the white races, he distinguishes the Aryan race as the pinnacle of human development, comprising the basis of all European aristocracies. However, inevitable miscegenation led to the \"downfall of civilizations\".\n\nGobineau was a Legitimist who despaired at France's decline into republicanism and centralization. The book was written after the 1848 revolution when Gobineau began studying the works of Xavier Bichat and Johann Blumenbach.\n\nThe book was dedicated to King George V of Hanover (1851–66), the last king of Hanover. In the dedication, Gobineau writes that he presents to His Majesty the fruits of his speculations and studies into the hidden causes of the \"revolutions, bloody wars, and lawlessness\" (\"révolutions, guerres sanglantes, renversements de lois\") of the age.\n\nIn a letter to Count Anton von Prokesch-Osten in 1856 he describes the book as based upon \"a hatred for democracy and its weapon, the Revolution, which I satisfied by showing, in a variety of ways, where revolution and democracy come from and where they are going.\"\n\nIn Vol I, chapter 11, \"Les différences ethniques sont permanentes\" (\"The ethnic differences are permanent\"), Gobineau writes that \"Adam is the originator of our white species\" (\"Adam soit l'auteur de notre espèce blanche\"), and creatures not part of the white race are not part of that species.\nBy this Gobineau refers to his division of humans into three main races: white, black, and yellow. The biblical division into Hamites, Semites, and Japhetites is for Gobineau a division \"within\" the white race. In general, Gobineau considers the Bible to be a reliable source of actual history, and he was not a supporter of the idea of polygenesis.\n\nJosiah Clark Nott hired Henry Hotze to translate the work into English. Hotze's translation was published in 1856 as The Moral and Intellectual Diversity of Races, with an added essay from Hotze and appendix from Nott. However, it \"omitted the laws of repulusion and attraction, which were at the heart of Gobineau's account of the role of race-mixing in the rise and fall of civilizations\". Gobineau was not pleased with the version; Gobineau was \"particularly concerned that Hotze had ignored his comments on 'American decay generally and upon slaveholding in particular'.\"\n\nThe German translation Versuch über die Ungleichheit der Menschenrassen first appeared in 1897 and was translated by Ludwig Schemann, a member of the Bayreuth Circle and \"one of the most important racial theorists of imperial and Weimar Germany\".\n\nA new English language version The Inequality of Human Races, translated by Adrian Collins, was published in Britain and the USA in 1915 and remains the standard English language version. It continues to be republished in the USA.\n\nSteven Kale argues that Gobineau's \"influence on the development of racial theory has been exaggerated and his ideas have been routinely misconstrued\".\n\nGobineau's ideas found an audience in the United States and in German-speaking areas more so than in France, becoming the inspiration for a host of racial theories, for example those of Houston Stewart Chamberlain. \"Gobineau was the first to theorize that race was the deciding factor in history and the precursors of Nazism repeated some of his ideas, but his principle arguments were either ignored, deformed, or taken out of context in German racial thought\".\n\nGerman historian Joachim C. Fest, who wrote a biography of Hitler, describes Gobineau, in particular his negative views on race-mixing as expressed in his essay, as an eminent influence on Adolf Hitler and Nazism. Fest writes that the influence of Gobineau on Hitler can be easily seen and that Gobineau's ideas were used by Hitler in simplified form for demagogic purposes: \"Significantly, Hitler simplified Gobineau's elaborate doctrine until it became demagogically usable and offered a set of plausible explanations for all the discontents, anxieties, and crises of the contemporary scene.\" However, Professor Steven Kale has cautioned that \"Gobineau's influence on German racism has been repeatedly overstated\".\n\nAlthough cited by groups such as the Nazi Party, the text implicitly criticizes antisemitism and describes Jews in positive terms, the Jews being seen as a superbly forged race of \"ancient Greek-like strength\" of cohesion. Implicitly, the folk of Judah merely represented a wandering, semi-austral variation of Ur-Aryan blood-stock. Gobineau stated, \"Jews... became a people that succeeded in everything it undertook, a free, strong, and intelligent people, and one which, before it lost, sword in hand, the name of an independent nation, had given as many learned men to the world as it had merchants.\" Philo-Judaic sentiment was intermixed with ethnological theories concerning the primally Indo-Iranian/Indo-Aryan archeogenetic matrix whence sprang the Jews. In these lines of speculative anthropology, the Jews were anciently (supposedly) primordially interpreted as of atypical Indo-European ethnicity: Judaic racial typology emerged from Iranid–Nordid founders, the details considered inessential, possessors of compatibly \"white\" \"Aryan\" blood being the main point. The latter-day \"Hamiticized\" Jewish folk came into existence from non-Afro-Asiatic Hurrian (or Horite), Jebusite, Amorite or early-Hittite, Mittani-affiliated racial nuclei, the \"consensus science\" of the time asserted. The blatantly, ironically almost aggressive pro-Jewish attitude of Gobineau, akin to Nietzsche in sheer admiration and lionization of the Jews as one of the \"highest races\", proved ideologically vertiginous to the Nazi propagandists and Procrustean thinkers—here Gobineau unmistakably contradicted perhaps the main pillar of Nazi political ideology, the schizoid, neo-Gnostic dualism of \"Jewish demonology\", painfully obvious as reflective of low-grade moral-intellectual barbarism. Incompatible with Nazi ideology, the Count's fervent Judaic positivity and total dearth of antisemitism the Nazis could only attempt to ignore or minimize away in the silence of hypocrisy.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "664004", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=664004", "title": "Animusic", "text": "Animusic\n\nAnimusic is an American company specializing in the 3D visualization of MIDI-based music. Founded by Wayne Lytle, it is incorporated in New York, with offices in Texas and California. The initial name of the company was Visual Music, but changed to Animusic in 1995.\n\nThe company is known for its \"Animusic\" compilations of computer-generated animations, based on MIDI events processed to simultaneously drive the music and on-screen action, leading to and corresponding to every sound. The animated short \"Pipe Dream\" showed at SIGGRAPH's Electronic Theater in 2001.\n\nUnlike many other music visualizations, the music drives the animation. While other productions may animate figures or characters to the music, the animated models in \"Animusic\" are created first, and are then programmed to follow what the music \"tells them\" to. 'Solo cams' featured on the \"Animusic\" DVD shows how each instrument plays through a piece of music from beginning to end.\n\nMany of the instruments appear to be robotic or play themselves using seemingly curious methods to produce and visualize the original compositions. The animations typically feature dramatically-lit rooms or landscapes.\n\nThe music of \"Animusic\" is principally pop-rock based, consisting of straightforward sequences of triggered samples and digital patches mostly played \"dry\" (with few ). There are no lyrics or voices, save for the occasional chorus synthesizer. According to the director's comments on \"Animusic 2\", most instrument sounds are generated with software synthesizers on a music workstation (see Software Programs for more info). Many sounds resemble stock patches available on digital keyboards, subjected to some manipulation, such as pitch or playback speed, to enhance the appeal of their timbre.\n\n, three video albums have been released:\n\n\nAll Animusic DVDs are set to Region 0, meaning they are playable in all DVD players worldwide.\n\n\"Animusic\" was released in 2001 on VHS, and later DVD, with a special edition DVD being released later, in 2004. This special edition included extra material, such as Animusic's first animation, \"Beyond the Walls\". A second album, \"Animusic 2\", was released in the United States in 2005. Later, in 2008, this volume was released in Japan through a distribution deal with Japanese company Jorudan, Co. Ltd. In a company newsletter, it was announced that the Animusic company would also be producing a high-definition version of \"Animusic 2\" on Blu-ray, to be released sometime before their third major album, \"Animusic 3\". This HD compilation was eventually released in November 2010, featuring all of the animations featured in \"Animusic 2\", as well as the animation \"Pipe Dream\" from \"Animusic\" encoded at a high bitrate. In a later newsletter, the working titles of three animations in \"Animusic 3\", “Sonic Warfare”, “Paddle Ball” and “Super Pipe Dream”, were revealed. In 2012, a Kickstarter campaign for \"Animusic 3\" was successfully launched and funded. \"Animusic 3\" has not yet been completed; however, \"The Sound of Twelve\", a music-only album made using similar harmonics as \"Animusic,\" was released in March 2015.\n\n\"Animusic\" has been promoted at SIGGRAPH since 1990, and has been promoted on Public Broadcasting Service and other television networks such as CNN. Wayne Lytle and his works have also been featured on Fox News and over 30 other local stations in January 2007. Animusic's \"Pipe Dream\" was released as a real-time demo for ATI's Radeon 9700 series graphics cards. Animusic also rendered \"Resonant Chamber\" and \"Starship Groove\" in HD resolution for Apple's QuickTime HD Gallery. A popular tourist destination located in Fredericksburg, Texas, the Rockbox Theater, often plays the \"Animusic\" DVDs either before shows or during intermission.\n\nThere was an internet rumor that suggested that the \"Pipe Dream\" video was actually a machine created at the University of Iowa from farm machinery parts. Although this has been proven false, the rumor is still considered \"pretty amusing\" to the Animusic staff. Intel later commissioned a version of the machine to be built which was demonstrated at IDF 2011.\n\nAccording to the company's FAQ, animation is created procedurally with their own proprietary MIDImotion engine. Discreet 3D Studio Max was used for modeling, lighting, cameras, and rendering. Maps were painted with Corel Painter, Deep Paint 3D, and Photoshop. They have also created their own software called ANIMUSIC|studio that is based on scene-graph technology. According to an August 2015 newsletter, Animusic has using Unreal Engine 4 for rendering since \"Animusic 3\".\n\n\n\n\nTrack listing:\n\n\n\nThere were also 3 other music pieces only available on the \"Animusic\" audio CD.\n\nSince they were never animated, it is difficult to determine the shapes of the instruments, although they may strongly resemble many seen in the two \"Animusic\" albums.\n\nTrack listing:\n\nThe bonus audio tracks on this CD consist of reduced versions of Heavy Light and Fiber Bundles:\n\n\nAnimusic is currently producing the third volume of the \"Animusic\" series; it was once intended to be released sometime in 2010, featuring animations such as \"Sonic Warfare\", \"Paddle Ball\", and \"Super Pipe Dream\". However, this release date passed with no word regarding the volume's progress. In November 2010, Animusic attributed this delay to a complete restructuring of their modeling and rendering software.\n\nOn August 6, 2012, the company began a Kickstarter campaign aimed at raising $200,000 to fund the completion of the \"Animusic 3\" DVD. This campaign was featured on several websites such as Animation World Network. A rough mix from the newly revealed album \"The Sound of 12\", titled \"Glarpedge,\" was released online on August 28, 2012. This album has been described by the company as \"the soul of \"Animusic 3\".\" On August 31, 2012, two more mixes were released: \"Emoticondria\" and \"EchoKrunch.\" The Kickstarter page was later updated to confirm that a Blu-ray edition of \"Animusic 3\" would be released shortly following the DVD's completion.\n\nOn September 5, 2012, the Kickstarter campaign ended successfully, with a final backing amount of $223,123, surpassing the goal and reportedly putting \"Animusic 3\" into its final production stages. Animusic posted expected shipping dates of October 2013 for the DVD, and February 2014 for the Blu-ray disc. However, both dates have passed without either product being released.\n\nAlthough the release of \"Animusic 3\" has been postponed for some time, others have created and released tribute animations and fan-made versions of the Animusic concept through YouTube while the third addition to the series has been anticipated. Over time, hundreds of these homemade animations have been produced and shared. The bulk of these animations have been created since shortly after the release of Animusic 2.\n\nOn a Kickstarter update in August 2015, Wayne Lytle announced some other factors that have delayed the project, including Dave Crognale's departure from the project, personal struggles, physical stress and injury, and the distribution of supplemental prizes for backers. However, he insisted on his determination to finish the project, expressing his excitement about the abilities of the newly-implemented Unreal Engine 4 and his gratitude for those who have invested in him. Lytle stated that he had withheld from posting an update until he had a completion date, but did not give one in the update.\n\nSince 2015, no further updates have been posted, and there is once again speculation as to whether Animusic 3 is still in production, and, if so, when it will be completed. Many Kickstarter backers have expressed their frustration with the company's continued lack of communication about the project, inferring that it is suffering from a lack of personnel in its production team, along with other issues.\n\nIn August 2017, the Animusic headquarters, including Animusic's office space and the Lytle residence, was sold to RP Solutions, Inc.\n\n\n"}

He has been described as 'an Irish-speaking Christy Moore, an incisive ballad singing entertainer for a totally Irish-speaking community of poor people living at or below subsistence in the early 18th century.' He was one of a school of ballad poetry that included Peadar Ó Doirnín, Art Mac Cumhaigh, and Séamas Dall Mac Cuarta.\n\nMac Giolla Ghunna was probably born in Fermanagh and, having initially studied to be a priest, settled for a career as a rake-poet. \nIt has been remarked about his poetry that 'of the handful of poems attributed to him, most are marked by a rare humanity, but none can match \"An Bonnán Buí\" \"(The Yellow Bittern)\" with its finely-judged blend of pathos and humour'. Although \"Cathal Buí\", as he is still affectionately termed in the folklore of Bréifne, is now little known in Ireland, his masterpiece \"An Bonnán Buí\" is one of the best known songs in Irish. \"An Bonnán Buí\" was based in Lough MacNean, which is situated between Fermanagh and Cavan.

Based in the Reims region of Champagne, it is one of the best-known producers for both vintage and non-vintage \"cuvée\". It is part of group since 2011. \nThe house was founded in 1851 by the French champagne maker Charles Camille Heidsieck, who became known as Champagne Charlie.\n\nCharles Heidsieck was born in 1822 into an eminent Reims family whose wine-making traditions date back to Florens-Louis Heidsieck (see Heidsieck & Co). In 1851, at age 29, he founded a wine house (Maison) bearing his own name. He began to sell his champagne abroad, starting in Belgium and in England, and in 1852 he travelled to the United States, becoming the first merchant to market his own champagne there. He was a larger than life dandy and became something of a social sensation, one New York newspaper describing him as \"Champagne Charlie\". He visited on three further occasions until the American Civil War disrupted trade. He returned to New York in an unsuccessful effort to recover debts owed by his agents and on visiting the south he became trapped by the conflict. In July 1862, Charles Heidsieck was arrested as a spy while travelling to New Orleans trying to flee back to France. He was sent to the infamous Fort Jackson in Louisiana. After many pleas, and the intercession of President Lincoln himself, Charles was released in November 1862, but he returned to France sick and bankrupt. His business was subsequently saved because a debt was repaid in deeds to land in Coronado where, shortly afterwards, there was a silver boom which turned the obscure village of Denver into valuable estate.\n\nCharles Heidsieck focused on selecting, blending and ageing wines to produce higher quality champagnes, buying grapes from individual growers. In 1867 he purchased several old chalk quarries, called crayères which dated from the Gallo-Roman era, in order to create optimal conditions for wine maturation. There cellars are now inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List along with others champagne vineyards, houses and cellars.\n\nHis showmanship and the quality of his wines earned him royal warrants from the many of the royal and imperial families of the time.\n\nFor a long period Charles Heidsieck was owned by the Henriot group. In 1985, Charles Heidsieck became part of the Rémy Cointreau wine and spirits group, and was sold in 2011 to privately owned French luxury goods group EPI (Société européenne de participations industrielles) founded by Christopher Descours.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1744532", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1744532", "title": "Creative director", "text": "Creative director\n\nA creative director is a position often found within the graphic design, film, music, video game, fashion, advertising, media, or entertainment industries, but may be useful in other creative organizations such as web development and software development firms as well.\n\nA creative director is a vital role in all of the arts and entertainment industries. In another sense, they can be seen as another element in any product development process. The creative director may also assume the roles of an art director, copywriter, or lead designer. The responsibilities of a creative director include leading the communication design, interactive design, and concept forward in any work assigned. For example, this responsibility is often seen in industries related to advertisement. The creative director is known to guide a team of employees with skills and experience related to graphic design, fine arts, motion graphics, and other creative industry fields. Some example works can include visual layout, brainstorming, and copywriting. To assume the role of a creative director, one must already have an existing set of skills and expertise in many areas. Often, these types of artists start up from the very beginning in fields that can relate to motion graphics, advertisement in television, and/or book (or magazine) publishing.\n\nIn the advertising industry, a creative director is determined to develop various marketing schemes and strategies for a company or client that he or she is hired by. Assuming one is hired by a company that is fairly well known and established, there would be some type of creative department or management that the director would work with. The creative director would also serve as the project manager that works directly with employers, and in most circumstances, they would be responsible for designing concepts for advertisements and other promotional needs for their client(s). Some examples of their duties involve copywriting and laying out chronological advertisement plans which explain the ongoing process of a project. It is important for an advertisement creative director to meet their goals at specific deadline with maximum efficiency as possible. To do so, they must be able to guide the creative department effectively from start to finish. Educational requirements of this position involve a blending of skills in business and journalism. To even be considered as a creative director, one would need to have a couple of years of experience in advertising (as little as five to as many as ten years).\n\nAdvertising creative directors are usually promoted from copy writing or art directing positions. Familiarity with film-making techniques is also common. Creative directors rise to become executive creative directors or chief creative officers, a position with executive responsibility for the entire creative department, and some progress to chairman of a firm.\n\nCreative directors usually possess a communication design or fine arts & animation degree. Copywriters may have degrees in journalism, language arts, or media innovation, or may develop more emphasis on advertising copy writing while pursuing a communication design degree.\n\nWith the increased team sizes and more specialised disciplines in the games industry, certain game designers are titled as 'creative director', 'executive designer', or 'game director'. A creative director in a video game company is usually responsible for product development across a number of titles and is generally regarded as the prime design authority across the company's product range. Some examples are Peter Molyneux, Sam Lake, Neil Druckmann, or Shigeru Miyamoto whose influence extends across more than one project.\n\nThe creative director has an important responsibility in this industry. The director must devise ideas to lead a video game project forward and many responsibilities involve working with various individuals or teams spread out within the entire project/video game production. This can include cross-functional collaboration with the various disciplines involved in games development. Academically speaking, a creative director is usually degree educated but there are some circumstances where a high school education strongly focusing on aspects such as art, graphics, computer science, and math can be acceptable and provide some valuable insight to students who hope to aspire in this field of work. Some skills that a creative director working in the video game industry may have include proficiency in computer programming and graphic development (illustrations, fine art) and have excellent interpersonal and writing skills (since they deal with many other clients and management leaders). The exact skills a game director possesses will depend on their background in the industry. Creative director, or game director, is not usually an entry level position, but in a smaller studio it can be. This is more common in start up companies for instance though normally one would have to earn that role by showing their skills and development over a period of years. The entertainment industry is not always a meritocracy, however, and sometimes people just luck into or inherit such positions. Creative directors have often done their share of lower level startup positions such as internships or assisting other directors in art related work fields. It is all about advancing through the career chain, and once one has earned the position a creative director, they may be eligible to work for larger and more popular game developing companies depending on how successful they have been with past collaborative projects.\n\nThe creative director in the film industry is referred to as the production designer. A production designer carries a large responsibility of designing the look of a movie. The job is similar to a creative director's role in the video game industry in that he or she manages a team of employees and has to consistently develop new ideas and methods of working. It is vital that designers in this field are able to produce expressive/creative ideas and translate them into something cinematic. Usually a certain sum of funds is distributed among different departments in the production of a film (in this case, the art department). Creative directors must decide on how to distribute and use the funds in the most efficient and effective way to ensure maximum quality in the films art department. An example can include the structuring of scenes and sets once a film begins to undergo the shooting process. During this process, it is important for creative directors to understand what props and effects should be used and how they should be used among various sets and scenes of the film. Some important qualifications that one should have include being able to manage teams, having expertise in design (specifically in theatre, interior sets and art design), being open minded to new ideas and methods in regards to organizing film sets, and having an understanding of coordinating among different departments in order to move a project towards success. A creative director in the film industry usually starts out in lower ranks of the chain, such as an assistant to other art directors and/or as a draughtsman.\n\nCreative directors in the field of music can be broken down into various key roles that make up the whole (it may be said that one can be known as a 'music director'). It is in this artistic field where the individual, the director, must master tasks that are relatable to one another. An orchestral conductor is a prime example (but not exclusive) of this role and how one would direct music and harmonize symphonies as well as guide/direct other musician’s in an ensemble. The three roles in this sense can consist of: the active musician, the musical art director, and the instructor that teaches and informs music for society. The main requirements one would need to have is an extensive background and knowledge of music (being able to master one or more instrument), understanding the principles and theories behind music composition, developing an understanding and connection with musicians that the director would be working with to communicate music in a harmonic and creative sense, and most importantly being able to develop leadership skills among other musicians.\n\nCreative director is the highest creative position in a fashion house. The creative director does not design clothes, but instead formulates and impresses upon the designers an overarching concept or concepts for a certain collection and the label as a whole. \nA fashion creative director's main role is to establish what designs should be created, what will appeal to the target market, and how the concepts will be applied and distributed in collaboration with fashion designers who are responsible for creating the clothing and fabrics.\n\n"}
{"id": "2106978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2106978", "title": "Culture of Ethiopia", "text": "Culture of Ethiopia\n\nThe culture of Ethiopia is diverse and generally structured along ethnolinguistic lines. The country's Afro-Asiatic-speaking majority adhere to an amalgamation of traditions that were developed independently and through interaction with neighbouring and far away civilizations, including other parts of Northeast Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, India, Italy and Malaysia. By contrast, the nation's Nilotic communities and other ethnolinguistic minorities tend to practice customs more closely linked with South Sudan and/or the African Great Lakes region.\n\nThe music of Ethiopia is extremely diverse, with each of the country's ethnic groups being associated with unique sounds. Some forms of traditional music are strongly influenced by folk music from elsewhere in the Horn of Africa, especially Somalia. However, Ethiopian religious music also has an ancient Christian element, traced to Yared, who lived during the reign of Gabra Masqal. In northeastern Ethiopia, in Wollo, a Muslim musical form called \"manzuma\" developed in 1907. Sung in Amharic, manzuma has spread to Harar and Jimma, where it is now sung in the Oromo language. In the Ethiopian Highlands, traditional secular music is played by itinerant musicians called \"azmari\" (Zageth), who are regarded with both suspicion and respect in Ethiopian society.\n\nIn the highlands, traditional string instruments include the \"masenqo\" (also known as masinko), a one-string bowed lute; the \"krar\" (also known as kirar), a six-string lyre; and the \"begena\", a large ten-string lyre. The \"dita\" (a five-string lyre) and musical bows (including an unusual three-string variant) are among the chordophones found in the south. Also \"kebero\" ( a drum) used by the religious group like Orthodox's or other Christian religious group to praise what they believe in.\n\nThe washint is a bamboo flute that is common throughout or in the highlands. Trumpet-like instruments include the ceremonial \"malakat\" used in some regions, and the \"holdudwa\" (animal horn; compare shofar) found mainly in the south. Embilta flutes have no finger holes, and produce only two tones, the fundamental and a fourth or fifth interval. These may be metal (generally found in the north) or bamboo (in the south). The Konso and other people in the south play fanta, or pan flutes.\n\nIn the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, liturgical music employs the senasel, a sistrum. Additionally, the clergy will use prayer staffs, or \"maqwamiya\", to maintain rhythm. Rural churches historically used a \"dawal\", made from stone slabs or pieces of wood, in order to call the faithful to prayer. The Beta Israel use a small gong called a \"qachel\" as liturgical accompaniment, though qachel may also refer to a small bell. The toom, a lamellophone, is used among the Nuer, Anuak, Majangir, Surma, and other Nilo-Saharan groups. Metal leg rattles are common throughout the south.\n\nThe kebero (ከበሮ) is a large hand drum used in the Orthodox Christian liturgy. Smaller kebero drums may be used in secular celebrations. The \"nagarit\" (ነጋሪት), played with a curved stick, is usually found in a secular context such as royal functions or the announcement of proclamations, though it has a liturgical function among the Beta Israel. The Gurage and other southern peoples commonly play the \"atamo\", a small hand drum sometimes made of clay.\n\nEthiopia is a musically traditional country. Popular music is played, recorded and listened to, but most musicians also sing traditional songs, and most audiences choose to listen to both popular and traditional styles. A long-standing popular musical tradition in Ethiopia was that of brass bands, imported from Jerusalem in the form of forty Armenian orphans (Arba Lijoch) during the reign of Haile Selassie. This band, which arrived in Addis Ababa on September 6, 1924, became the first official orchestra of Ethiopia. By the end of World War II, large orchestras accompanied singers; the most prominent orchestras were the Army Band, Police Band, and Imperial Bodyguard Band. Most of these bands were trained by Europeans or Armenians.\n\nFrom the 1950s to the 1970s, Ethiopian popular musicians included Bizunesh Bekele, Mahmoud Ahmed, Alemayehu Eshete, Hirut Bekele, Ali Birra, Ayalew Mesfin, Kiros Alemayehu, Muluken Melesse and Tilahun Gessesse, while popular folk musicians included Alemu Aga, Kassa Tessema, Ketema Makonnen, Asnaketch Worku, and Mary Armede. Perhaps the most influential musician of the period, however, was Ethio-jazz innovator Mulatu Astatke. Amha Records, Kaifa Records, and Philips-Ethiopia were prominent Ethiopian record labels during this era. Since 1997, Buda Musique's \"Éthiopiques\" series has compiled many of these singles and albums on compact disc.\n\nDuring the 1980s, the Derg controlled Ethiopia, and emigration became almost impossible. Musicians during this period included Ethio Stars, Wallias Band and Roha Band, though the singer Neway Debebe was most popular. He helped to popularize the use of Sem ena Worq (wax and gold, a poetic form of double entendre) in music (previously only used in qiné, or poetry) that often enabled singers to criticize the government without upsetting the censors.\n\nPopular musicians from Ethiopia include internationally renowned and recognized artists such as the Los Angeles–area expatriate Aster Aweke, The Weeknd and Teddy Afro, who is often accredited with the fusion of Rastafarian styles into mainstream Ethiopian music. More recently, music from Tigray and Eritrea has become popular in Ethiopia and among exiles, especially in Italy. One of the biggest new trends, however, has been the rise of bolel, a sort of blues-like music, played by sarcastic azmari playing in parts of Addis Ababa, especially Yohannès Sefer and Kazentchis. Bolel musicians include Tigist Assefa, Tedje and Admassou Abate.\n\nCurrently the most prominent Ethiopian singer internationally is Gigi. Through her performing with top jazz musicians such as Bill Laswell (who is also her husband) and Herbie Hancock, Gigi has brought Ethiopian music to popular attention, especially in the United States, where she now lives.\n\nOther popular performers include Tewodros Tadesse, Neway Debebe, Tadesse Alemu, Hamelmal Abate, Martha Ashagari, Yohannes Berhanu, Kuku Sebsebe, Aster Aweke, and Manalemosh Dibo. Neway was very popular among the youth of the 1980s and early 1990s with such songs as \"Yetekemt Abeba,\" \"Metekatun Ateye,\" \"Safsaf,\" and \"Gedam,\" among others. Abatte Barihun has exemplified all four main qenets on his 2005 album Ras Deshen.\n\n\"Éthiopiques\" producer Francis Falceto criticizes contemporary Ethiopian music for eschewing traditional instruments and ensemble playing in favor of one-man bands using synthesizers. Harvard University professor Kay Kaufman Shelemay, on the other hand, maintains that there is genuine creativity in the contemporary music scene. She further points out that Ethiopian music is not alone in shifting to electronically produced music, a point that Falceto acknowledges.\n\nIn some central and northern areas, women's traditional clothes are often made from cloth called \"shemma\". It is basically cotton cloth, about 90 cm wide, woven in long strips which are then sewn together. Sometimes shiny threads are woven into the fabric for an elegant effect. It takes about two to three weeks to make enough cloth for one dress. The bottom of the garment or shirt may be ornamented with patterns.\n\nMen wear pants and a knee-length shirt with a white collar, and perhaps a sweater. They also frequently wear knee-high socks, while women might not wear socks at all. Men as well as women wear shawls, the \"netela\". The shawls are worn in a different style for different occasions. When going to church, women cover their hair with them and pull the upper ends of the shawl about their shoulders reproducing a cross (\"meskelya\"), with the shiny threads appearing at the edge. During funerals, the shawl is worn so the shiny threads appear at the bottom (\"madegdeg\"). Women's dresses are called \"habesha kemis\", and are often made from the shemma cloth. The dresses are usually white with some color above the lower hem. Bracelets and necklaces of silver or gold are worn on arms and feet to complete the look. A variety of designer dinner dresses combining traditional fabric with modern style are now worn by some ladies in the cities.\n\nThese traditional clothes are still worn on a day-to-day-basis in the countryside. In cities and towns, western clothes are popular. However, on special occasions such as New Year (\"Enkutatash\"), Christmas (\"Genna\") or weddings, some wear traditional clothes.\n\nOften, a woman will cover her head with a \"shash\", a cloth that is tied at the neck. \"Shama\" and \"kuta\", gauze-like white fabrics, are often used. This is common among both Muslim and Christian women. Elderly women will wear a sash on a day-to-day basis, while other women only wear a sash also called a \"netela\" while attending church.\n\nThe Ethiopian cuisine consists of various vegetable or meat side dishes and entrees, often prepared as a \"wat\" or thick stew. One or more servings of wat are placed upon a piece of injera, a large sourdough flatbread, which is 50 cm (20 inches) in diameter and made out of fermented teff flour. One does not eat with utensils, but instead uses injera (always with the right hand) to scoop up the entrees and side dishes. Traditional Ethiopian food does not use any pork or seafood (aside from fish), as most Ethiopians have historically adhered to Islam, the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, or Judaism, all of which prohibit eating pork. Additionally, throughout a given year, Orthodox Christians observe numerous fasts (such as Lent), during which food is prepared without any meat or dairy products. Another dish served in Ethiopia is Doro wat, which is chicken stew with hard boiled eggs.\n\nTrack and field is Ethiopia's most successful sport, in which they have won many medals in the Olympic Games. Football is the most popular sport in Ethiopia. Despite lack of success by the national team, it is supported by a significant part of the population.\n\nRadio and television are under the control of the Ethiopian government. There are nine radio broadcast stations, eight AM and one shortwave, licensed to operate. The major radio broadcasting stations (all AM) are Radio Ethiopia, Radio Torch (pirate), Radio Voice of One Free Ethiopia, and the Voice of the Revolution of Tigray. The single television broadcast network is Ethiopian Television. In keeping with government policy, radio broadcasts occur in a variety of languages. Print media, because of high poverty levels, low literacy rates, and poor distribution outside of the capital, serve only a small portion of the population. Major daily newspapers include \"Addis Zemen\", the \"Daily Monitor\", and the \"Ethiopian Herald\". There is also a small but lively film industry.\n\nAccording to Ethnologue, there are ninety individual languages spoken in Ethiopia. Most people in the country speak Afro-Asiatic languages of the Cushitic or Semitic branches. The former includes Oromiffa, spoken by the Oromo people, and Somali, spoken by the Somali people; the latter includes Amharic, spoken by the Amhara people, and Tigrinya, spoken by the Tigray-Tigrinya people. Together, these four groups make up about three-quarters of Ethiopia's population. Other Afro-Asiatic languages with a significant number of speakers include the Cushitic Sidamo, Afar, Hadiyya and Agaw languages, as well as the Semitic Gurage, Harari, Silt'e and Argobba tongues.\n\nAdditionally, Omotic languages are spoken by Omotic ethnic minority groups inhabiting the southern regions. Among these idioms are Aari, Bench, Dawro, Dime, Dizi, Gamo, Gofa, Maale, Hamer and Wolaytta.\n\nLanguages from the Nilo-Saharan phylum are also spoken by the nation's Nilotic ethnic minorities, who are concentrated in the southwestern parts of the country. These tongues include Nuer, Anuak, Nyangatom, Majang, Surma, Me'en and Mursi.\n\nEnglish is the most widely spoken foreign language and is the medium of instruction in secondary schools. Amharic was the language of primary school instruction, but has been replaced in many areas by regional languages such as Oromiffa, Somali or Tigrinya. While all languages enjoy equal state recognition in the 1995 Constitution of Ethiopia, Amharic is recognized as the official working language of the Federal Government. The various regions of Ethiopia are free to determine their own working languages, with Oromiffa, Somali and Tigrinya recognized as official working languages in their respective regions.\n\nIn terms of writing systems, Ethiopia's principal orthography is Ge'ez or Ethiopic. Employed as an abugida for several of the country's languages, it first came into usage in the 6th and 5th centuries BC as an abjad to transcribe the Semitic Ge'ez language. Ge'ez now serves as the liturgical language of the Ethiopian and Eritrean Orthodox Churches. Other writing systems have also been used over the years by different Ethiopian communities. The latter include Sheikh Bakri Sapalo's script for Oromo.\n\nAbout 62% of the population adhere to Christianity, which is Ethiopia's main religion. About 30-35% of the population are Muslim, with other religions covering another 4-5%.\n\nThere are a number of public holidays in Ethiopia. Among these holidays are Meskel and Ramadan.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23033439", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23033439", "title": "Dyslexia research", "text": "Dyslexia research\n\nDyslexia is a neurological symptom wherein an individual experiences difficulty reading. The neurological nature and underlying causes of dyslexia are an active area of research, and the distinction of dyslexia as a condition is a topic of some controversy. \n\nDyslexia was first identified by Oswald Berkhan in 1881, and the term 'dyslexia' later coined in 1887 by Rudolf Berlin, an ophthalmologist practicing in Stuttgart, Germany. \n\nDuring the twentieth century, dyslexia was primarily seen as a phonological deficit (specifically phonological awareness) that resulted in a reading deficit. Dyslexia was seen as an issue with reading achievement specifically, caused by deficits in discrimination of written word sounds as opposed to a broader disorder of brain function. However, much research from the 1990s onward has focused on the potential biological bases of dyslexia and understanding dyslexia as a disorder of brain function. One of the first weaknesses of the strictly phonological deficit hypothesis for dyslexia was its inability to account for the genetic link of dyslexia. Specifically, it's been shown that \"Relatively high heritabilities were observed for both reading ability and dyslexia indicating substantial genetic influences.\" In a large twin study (sample 1031 twins), Gayan and Olson established that dyslexia was highly heritable, while a family study by Pennington (sample 1698 individuals) showed familial risk rates of 35-45%. \n\nWithout a biological explanation for dyslexia, this heritability went unexplained. Not only must the heritability be explained, but also the environmental factors that protected at-risk children from developing dyslexia. Research began to focus on potential biological causes and to center the study of dyslexia in a developmental framework. A second major weakness of the strictly phonological deficit hypothesis was its strict definition of dyslexia as a reading disorder. Consequently, the various secondary symptoms were unable to be explained, including automatization deficits of both skill and knowledge acquisition, balance impairments, motor skill/writing deficits, and muscle tone underdevelopment. New theories of dyslexia began to be a focus of research, with the most well established being the magnocellular deficit theory the automatization deficit theory, and the double-deficit hypothesis.\n\nTheories of the etiology of dyslexia have and are evolving with each new generation of dyslexia researchers, and the more recent theories of dyslexia tend to enhance one or more of the older theories as understanding of the nature of dyslexia evolves.\n\nTheories should not be viewed as competing, but as attempting to explain the underlying causes of a similar set of symptoms from a variety of research perspectives and background.\n\nThe cerebellar theory of dyslexia asserts that the cause of dyslexia is an abnormality in the cerebellum (a region in the back of the brain), which in turn cause disruption in normal development, which causes issues with motor control, balance, working memory, attention, automatization, and ultimately, reading. This theory was initially proposed by Harold Levinson and Jan Frank in 1973 and further developed by Levinson and other researchers. Angela Fawcett and Rod Nicolson later proposed that the cerebellum contributes to motor control during the articulation of speech, and that articulation problems can contribute to the phonological processing deficits that can cause dyslexia. They also reasoned that the cerebellum contributes to the automatisation of learned behaviors, which may include learning the grapheme-phoneme relationships when reading text.\nIn attempting to explain all the many known reading and non-reading dyslexic symptoms, therapies and theories as well as the presence of only cerebellar and related vestibular neurophysiological signs in dyslexics, the cerebellum was postulated to coordinate in time and space all signals (visual, auditory, tactile, proprioceptive, motion) entering and leaving the brain as well as signal interconnections. The quality and severity of the many symptoms characterizing each dyslexic was reasoned to depend on the diverse cerebral cortical and other brain processors receiving scrambled signals due to a cerebellar dysfunction. Helpful therapies were reasoned to enhance cerebellar fine tuning (e.g., the use of cerebellar-vestibular stabilizing antimotion sickness medications) and/or improve descrambling and other compensatory cognitive capabilities (e.g., tutoring, biofeedback). Most other theories equate the dyslexia disorder with impaired reading comprehension and so attempt to only explain the latter. Another cerebellar proposal indicated that articulation problems can contribute to the phonological deficits that can cause dyslexia. The cerebellum also contributes to the automitisation of learned behaviors, which can include learning the grapheme-phoneme relationships when reading texts.\n\nHowever, some have suggested that cerebellar dysfunction alone may not be a primary cause of dyslexia and that dysarticulation and phonological deficits appear unrelated.\n\nThis theory considers that reading is an unnatural act carried out for a very brief period in human evolutionary history. It has only been in the last hundred years that reading a visual form of speech has been promoted as a major form of communication, and subsequently a lack of time for reading behaviors to evolve. In many societies around the world the majority of the population do not use the visual notation of speech as a form of communication and do not use reading skills, and therefore have no dyslexia.\n\nMany developmental dyslexics significantly compensate for their cerebellar-vestibular\ndetermined symptoms and signs over time and most normal young children evidence age-appropriate \"dyslexic-like\" symptoms and cerebellar-vestibular(CV) \"immaturities.\" It was thus hypothesized that genetic dyslexia may represent an ontogenetic recapitulation of a pre-reading state in phylogeny and that ontogeny extended beyond the embryo into childhood and occasionally beyond, thus perhaps explaining late and even late-late blooming. The development of reading and related writing and spelling functioning, as well as the corresponding ontogenetic CV-cerebral developmental lag hypothesis of dyslexia, is indirectly supported by studies suggesting that \"the cerebellum has enlarged between three and fourfold in [only] the past million years of evolution [together with a corresponding spurt of the cerebrum].\"\n\nThe Magnocellular theory attempts to unify the Cerebellar Theory, the Phonological Theory, the Rapid Auditory Processing Theory, and the Visual Theory. The Magnocellular theory proposes that the magnocellular dysfunction is not only restricted to the visual pathways but also includes auditory and tactile modalities. \n\nAs of 2010, studies of visual evoked potentials have generally supported this theory. While some studies of contrast sensitivity have supported it. Subjects' age (10-46), differences in experimental design, small sample sizes (<10 dyslexic subjects in prominent studies), and the presence, absence, or failure to assess for comorbid ADHD might explain these contradictory findings.\n\nThe speed with which an individual can engage in the rapid automatized naming of familiar objects or letters is a strong predictor of dyslexia. Slow naming speed can be identified as early as kindergarten and persists in adults with dyslexia.\n\nA deficit in naming speed is hypothesized to represent a deficit that is separate from phonological processing deficit. Wolf identified four types of readers: readers with no deficits, readers with phonological processing deficit, readers with naming speed deficit, and readers with double deficit (that is, problems both with phonological processing and naming speed). Students with double deficits are most likely to have some sort of severe reading impairment.\n\nDistinguishing among these deficits has important implications for instructional intervention. If students with double deficits receive instruction only in phonological processing, they are only receiving part of what they need.\n\nThe concept of a perceptual noise exclusion deficit (impaired filtering of behaviorally irrelevant visual information in dyslexia or visual-noise) is an emerging hypothesis, supported by research showing that subjects with dyslexia experience difficulty in performing visual tasks (such as motion detection in the presence of perceptual distractions) but do not show the same impairment when the distracting factors are removed in an experimental setting. The researchers have analogized their findings concerning visual discrimination tasks to findings in other research related to auditory discrimination tasks. They assert that dyslexic symptoms arise because of an impaired ability to filter out both visual and auditory distractions, and to categorize information so as to distinguish the important sensory data from the irrelevant.\n\nThe phonological deficit theory proposes that people with dyslexia have a specific sound manipulation impairment, which affects their auditory memory, word recall, and sound association skills when processing speech. The phonological theory explains a reading impairment when using an alphabetic writing system which requires learning the grapheme/phoneme correspondence, the relationship between the graphic letter symbols and speech sounds which they represent.\n\nThe rapid auditory processing theory is an alternative to the phonological deficit theory, which specifies that the primary deficit lies in the perception of short or rapidly varying sounds. Support for this theory arises from evidence that people with dyslexia show poor performance on a number of auditory tasks, including frequency discrimination and temporal order judgment.\n\nThe visual theory represents a traditional perspective of dyslexia, as being the result of a visual impairment creating problems when processing information from letters and words from a written text. This includes visual processing problems such as binocular, poor vergence, and visual crowding. The Visual Theory does not deny the possibility of alternative causes of dyslexia\n\nVarious methods and models have been used to study dyslexia.\n\nHigh genetic concordance found in twin studies suggest a significant genetic influence on reading ability, although the degree depends on the definition of dyslexia. Linkage analysis and genetic association studies (typically quantitative trait locus association studies, which use microarrays to look at single nucleotide polymorphisms of multiple genes at once) have been used to identify candidate genes that may be implicated in dyslexia, which have then been confirmed in various knockout models.\n\nAs of 2018 the leading candidate genes included DYX1C1 on chromosome 15, DCDC2 and KIAA0319 on chromosome 6, and ROBO1 on chromosome 3. These genes appear to be involved in neuronal migration, which has led to a theory of impaired migration during development of the nervous system in humans as a cause for developmental dyslexia. Other genes associated with dyslexia have included RBFOX2, ABCC13, ZNF385D, COL4A2 and FGF18.\n\nHowever, these genes account for a small proportion of variance in reading disability, often less than 0.5%. Additionally, the findings are not always replicated nor consistently supported by genome-wide association studies. Therefore, no single gene is definitively implicated in dyslexia. A 2007 review reported that no specific cognitive processes are known to be influenced by the proposed genes and that scientists had begun to include neurophysiological (e.g., event-related potential) and imaging (e.g., functional MRI) procedures in their phenotype characterisation of people with dyslexia.\n\nIt is likely that multiple genes, as well as the environment, interact to influence reading ability. The Generalist Genes Hypothesis proposes that many of the same genes are implicated within different aspects of a learning disability as well as between different learning disabilities. Indeed, there also appear to be a large genetic influence on other learning abilities, such as language skills. The Generalist Genes Hypothesis supports the findings that many learning disabilities are comorbid, such as speech sound disorder, language impairment, and reading disability, although this is also influenced by diagnostic overlap.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are the main neuroimaging methods used to study brain structure in people with dyslexia, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) along with EEG are used to study brain function.\n\nVisual processes constitute an important part of higher cortical functioning. The encoding and interpretation of retinal stimulation occur at the neurological level upon reception of afferent input from the eyes. Reading, for example, requires the possession of both adequate vision and the neurological ability to process what is seen. In the past, many researchers have associated anomalies in the visual system as the main cause of dyslexia. While acknowledging that most such theories are untenable, visual system deficits have been shown to contribute to symptoms of dyslexia, such as word reversal and skipping words.\n\nA small subset of dyslexic individuals have been demonstrated to have deficits in the magnocellular visual system. A compromised magnocellular system, responsible for the processing of images with high temporal frequencies and high degree of movement, might be the main contributing factor to the reported \"masking\" of words reported amongst dyslexic individuals. Researchers posit that such a \"masking\" effect is due to the abnormal longevity of the visual trace produced in the magnocellular system, resulting in a lapse in acuity as effected individuals attempt to process connected text. \n\nAnomalies in saccadic movement, which are instantaneous, fast, oscillating eye movements essential for unimpaired reading have been observed in people with dyslexia. When corrected for reading ability, dyslexic individuals demonstrate below normal saccadic eye movements, suggesting that the severity reading disorders may be due to oculo-motor deficits. However, further examination of the phenomenon shows that saccadic patterns in dyslexics seem to be a result and not the cause of the disorder, as decoding and comprehension failure were isolated as the antecedent for impairments in both the speed and accuracy with which dyslexics read. Also, there is no evidence that children with oculomotor impariments are at risk of developing dyslexia.\n\nAlso suspected are convergence insufficiency and poor accommodation, both of which are uncommon in children, can interfere with the physical act of reading but not with decoding.\n\nBrain activation studies using PET to study language have found that people with dyslexia have a deficit in parts of the left hemisphere of the brain involved in reading, which includes the inferior frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, and middle and ventral temporal cortex. A neural basis for the visual lexicon and for auditory verbal short term memory components have been proposed. Wernicke's and Broca's areas are being recast in terms of localized components of phonological input and output. Some classical regions, such as the arcuate fasciculus, are having their \"classical\" roles questioned, while other regions, such as the basal temporal language zone, are growing progressively in terms of their recognized importance.\n\nPeople with dyslexia have been commonly associated with working memory deficits, along with reduced activity in the pre-frontal and parietal cortex.\n\nObserved differences in the neural pattern of people with dyslexia, namely decreased activation in the left and posterior midfrontal gyrus (LMG, PMG) and superior parietial regions of the brain further supports the view that deficits in working memory contribute to dyslexia. LMG and PMG are commonly associated with working memory processes such as memory updating and temporal order memory. Behavioral experiments in dyslexia have largely been supportive of the mediating role assumed by working memory between neurological abnormalities and dyslexic behavior.\n\nIt is difficult to control for confounders when attempting to isolate specific causes; for example, the response to instructions by children is itself confounded by a subjects' environments, genetics and socio-economic status.\n\nIn recent years there has been significant debate on the categorization of dyslexia. In particular, Elliot and Gibbs argue that \"attempts to distinguish between categories of 'dyslexia' and 'poor reader' or 'reading disabled' are scientifically unsupportable, arbitrary and thus potentially discriminatory\".\n\nWhile acknowledging that reading disability is a valid scientific curiosity, and that \"seeking greater understanding of the relationship between visual symbols and spoken language is crucial\" and that while there was \"potential of genetics and neuroscience for guiding assessment and educational practice at some stage in the future\", they conclude that \"there is a mistaken belief that current knowledge in these fields is sufficient to justify a category of dyslexia as a subset of those who encounter reading difficulties\".\n\n\"The Dyslexia Myth\" is a documentary that first aired in September 2005 as part of the \"Dispatches\" series produced by British broadcaster Channel 4. Focusing only on the reading difficulties that people with dyslexia encounter the documentary says that myths and misconceptions surround dyslexia. It argues that the common understanding of dyslexia is not only false but makes it more difficult to provide the reading help that hundreds of thousands of children desperately need. Drawing on years of intensive academic research on both sides of the Atlantic, it challenged the existence of dyslexia as a separate condition, and highlighted the many different forms of reading styles.\n\nJulian Elliot, an educational psychologist at Durham University in the United Kingdom, disputes the characterization of dyslexia as a medical condition, and believes it should be treated simply as a reading difficulty. According to Elliot, \"Parents don’t want their child to be considered lazy, thick or stupid. If they get called this medically diagnosed term, dyslexic, then it is a signal to all that it’s not to do with intelligence.” Elliot believes that children of all levels of intelligence may struggle with learning to read, and that all can be helped by educational strategies appropriate to their needs. He feels that resources are wasted on diagnosis and testing, and favors early intervention programs for all struggling readers.\nMore recently Julian Elliot has also made reference to the 28 Definitions of Dyslexia which were documented in the Appendices of the National Research and Development Centre for Adult Literacy and Numeracy report on Developmental dyslexia in adults: a research review by Michael Rice with Greg Brooks May 2004. \nJohn Everatt of the University of Surrey 2007, has suggested that:- \nand thus recommends more comprehensive evaluation and targeted interventions.\n\n\n"}

It is a nonprofit cultural institution which produces performing arts programs, publications, films, and music events. It also organizes touring shows, discussions, forums, master-classes and workshops. Important components of its work include a creation of new work and a commitment to international cooperation.\n\nMission of the East West Theatre Company Sarajevo is to raise awareness of the importance of multiculturalism in the Balkan region and around the world. It strives to serve as a platform for artists coming from different backgrounds as well as to produce the works of art of the highest standard. Their programmes and policies are based on equality and are oriented towards promoting diversity in terms of ethnicity, race, religion, gender and sexual orientation.\n\nHaris Pašović, Director of the East West Theatre Company is an internationally acclaimed multiple awarded theatre and film director who has been of a leading cultural and public figure in the Balkans for decades. His achievements include: co-founding of the Directing Department at the Performing Arts Academy in Sarajevo; managing the International Theatre and Film Festival MES during the siege of Sarajevo (during which he produced a production of Waiting for Godot directed by Susan Sontag ); founding of the Sarajevo Film Festival \"Beyond the End of the World\" during the siege of Sarajevo; founding of the East West Theatre Company in Sarajevo.\nThe East West Theatre Company has been performing extensively in the Balkan region and around the world. Some of the venues it performed at include the Edinburgh International Festival; Napoli Teatro Festival Italia, National Arts Festival of South Africa; Singapore Arts Festival; International Theatre Festival Poland as well as the festivals in St. Petersburg, Sibiu, Ljubljana, Belgrade, Zagreb, and many others.\n\nThe East West Theatre Company's repertoire consists of the following shows: W. Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\"; \"Faust\" based on Marlowe; N. Williams' \"Class Enemy\" (2007-), Michael Frayn's \"Copenhagen\"; \"Bolero, Sarajevo\" based on Maurice Ravel's work; Ibsen inspired \"Nora\"; H.C.Andersen's \"The Ugly Duckling\"; H. Pašović's \"Football, Football\"; a documentary film \"Dreamers\";\"Europe Today\" based on Miroslav Krleža's essay and \"Roses for Anne Teresa/Football Stories\".\n\nWilliam Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" was performed in several countries and it was set in the context of the Ottoman Empire. It was one of the Balkan's largest regional co-productions in the past twenty-five years and it involved artists from eight countries. British Reuters, CNN as well as many other media outlets reported about the production. Amar Selimović, as Hamlet, was awarded the Best Young Actor Award at the International Theatre Festival MES Sarajevo.\n\n\"Faust\" (produced in 2006) opened the MES Festival Sarajevo 2006 and in only two days attracted (for Bosnia and Herzegovina) record breaking 2,000 spectators. Based on Christopher Marlowe's masterpiece, this production was set in the near future and it examined the impact of the rapid development of technology on contemporary life.\n\nAs the first Balkan company ever, the East West Theatre Company participated at the Edinburgh International Festival 2008 with Nigel Williams’ play \"Class Enemy\" (produced in 2007). It is a play about juvenile violence and disillusioned youth adapted to Bosnian circumstances. \"The Times\", \"Financial Times\", \"The Guardian\", \"The Herald\", \"The Independent\", \"The Scotsman\", \"Scotland on Sunday\", BBC, BBC World Service and many other British media reported extensively about the East West Theatre Company. \"Class Enemy\" has been pronounced as the Best Contemporary Show at the International Festival Kontakt, Toruń, Poland, and as The Best Play of the Year in Singapore's leading newspaper \"Strait Times\" and the leading theatre portal The Flying Inkpot.\n\nIn 2008, East West Theatre Company toured with \"Class Enemy\" in Scotland in the small cities such as Cumbernauld, Rutherglen, and Stirling. With the same play, East West Theatre Company also toured to more than thirty Bosnia and Herzegovina towns. Most of the tour towns have not hosted a single theatre production for several decades prior to the arrival of the East West Theater Company's \"Class Enemy\".\n\nIn 2010, East West Theatre Company was invited to create an international theatre and dance production \"Football, Football\". The show was written and directed by Haris Pašović, and produced in cooperation with Napoli Teatro Festival, Singapore Arts Festival, Les Ballet C de la B, legendary contemporary dance company and Flota Institute from Slovenia. Since the May 2010 opening, the show has been performed fifteen times on three continents (Europe, Asia and Africa). The artists coming from four continents (Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia) and seven countries (Italy, Slovenia, Singapore, Burkina Faso, Bosnia and Herzegovina, China and Australia) gathered to work on the project.\n\nReuters, British Guardian, Channel News Asia, CNN Mexico, China Daily, India Times, Daily News Pakistan, ABC News and media in Italy, Spain, Australia, Singapore and Indonesia wrote extensively about the show.\n\n\"Football, Football\" was a highlight of the National Arts Festival in South Africa that was taking place during the FIFA World Cup 2010. During the Napoli Teatro Festival Italia the East West Theatre Company organised a workshop presenting the story of football to 300 kids coming from deprived areas of the region of Campania.\n\nIn February 2009, the East West Theatre Company hosted one of the highest-profile theatre companies in Europe, Schaubühne Berlin, as a central part of the project East West Fest – Berlin in Sarajevo. This was one of the events in Europe that marked the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. Schaubühne Theatre presented themselves to local audience with three of their productions:\n\nShakespeare's \"Hamlet\" directed by Thomas Osteremeir played in the Olympic Hall Zetra before more than 2,500 spectators, Arthur Miller's \"Death of a Salesman\" directed by Luk Perceval and F. Richter \"Under Ice\" in the National Theatre for more than 1,300 spectators.\n\nIn 2007 and 2008, East West organized events in the National Theatre Sarajevo celebrating April 6 – The Liberation Day of the City of Sarajevo.\n\nIn February 2011 East West Theatre Company co-produced a show called \"Europe Today\". Their co-producer was the largest Slovenian theatre – Slovene National Theatre, Maribor and European Cultural Capital 2012 Maribor. The show was written by Miroslav Krleža and directed by Haris Pašović with some of the finest artists in the region: Miki Manojlović, an actor; Edward Clug, a contemporary dancer and choreographer and the industrial, neoclassical band Laibach. The dramaturge of the production was the Zagreb Youth Theatre director, Dubravka Vrgoč. Financial Times gave it excellent reviews rated it with four stars.\n\nIn the past three years East West Theatre Company has organized master classes and workshops with some of the Europe's leading directors, producers and choreographers such as Thomas Ostermeier (artistic director of Schaubuhne), Luk Perceval (artistic director of Thalía Theatre Hamburg), Tobias Veit (chief producer of Schaubuhne), James Morrison (producer of Guthrie Theatre Minneapolis), Mark Russel (director of Under the Radar Festival New York), Steve Kirkham and Madelaine Brennan (choreographer from Mathew Bourne's New Adventures), Larisa Lipovac and Tamara Curić (directors of Contemporary Dance Center TALA, Zagreb). Haris Pašović, artistic director held workshops for Scottish theatre and film directors in Edinburgh and master classes for professionals in Belfast, Singapore, Zagreb and Subotica.\n\nIn October 2011 East West Theatre Company, in co-production with Prime Cut Productions from Belfast, the Bosnian National Theatre Zenica and the Slovenian Youth Theatre of Ljubljana organized a five-day workshop in Zenica on the theme \"Do the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Northern Ireland have the right to be happy? \". This workshop was greatly inspired by Bertrand Russell's work The Conquest of Happiness, and materials generated there will serve as a basis for a future production.\n\nEast West Theatre Company and the City of Sarajevo are the main organizers of a large-scale event called Sarajevo Red Line which in April 2012 commemorated the Siege of Sarajevo's 20th anniversary. This drama and music poem dedicated to citizens killed during the 1992-96 siege of their city consisted of 11,541 red chairs placed on the main Sarajevo street and it also included a street exhibition and a concert.\n\nEast West Theatre Company has collaborated with many partners, such as British Council, MOTT Foundation, Open Society Fond, Goethe Institut, LOTTO Foundation Berlin, Schaubuhne Berlin, US Embassy, UK Embassy, Norway Embassy, French Embassy, NATO, EUFOR, OSCE, the Council of City of Belgrade, the City of Sarajevo, the City of Zagreb, the City of Ljubljana, the Ministry of Culture of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Canton Sarajevo, the Ministry of Civil Affairs of BiH. We also collaborated with some of the most prestigious world festivals, such as Edinburgh International Festival, Singapore Arts Festival, Napoli Teatro Festival Italy, International Theatre Festival Kontakt (Poland), Sibiu International Festival (Romania), EX Ponto (Slovenia), Sterijino Pozorje (Novi Sad), International Theatre Festival MES Sarajevo, International Theatre Festival Ohrid Summer (Macedonia) and Yugoslav Drama Theatre in Belgrade, Kosztolany Theatre in Subotica, Mladinsko Gledališče in Lubljana, Zagreb Youth Theatre, TALA Centre etc.\n\nEast West Theatre Company won the 2009 Golden Wreath for Contribution to Theatre at the International Theatre Festival MES Sarajevo.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "21533922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21533922", "title": "Extensive reading", "text": "Extensive reading\n\nExtensive reading, free reading, book flood, or reading for pleasure is a way of language learning, including foreign language learning, through large amounts of reading. As well as facilitating acquisition of vocabulary, it is believed to increase motivation through positive affective benefits. It is believed that extensive reading is an important factor in education. Proponents such as Krashen (1989) claim that reading alone will increase encounters with unknown words, bringing learning opportunities by inferencing. The learner's encounters with unknown words in specific contexts will allow the learner to infer and thus learn those words' meanings. While the mechanism is commonly accepted as true, its importance in language learning is disputed. ()\n\nIn language learning, extensive reading is contrasted with \"intensive reading\", which is slow, careful reading of a small amount of difficult text – it is when one is \"focused on the language rather than the text\". Extensive and intensive reading are two approaches to language learning and instruction, and may be used concurrently; intensive reading is, however, the more common approach, and often the only one used.\n\nExtensive reading has been used and advocated in language learning since at least the 19th century (with Latin; see below). In the first language, many connections have been made between reading and vocabulary size, as well as other academic skills.\n\n\"Free voluntary reading\" refers to using extensive reading in language education. Students are free to choose a book that they like and are allowed to read it at their own pace. The aim of a free voluntary reading program is to help students to enjoy reading, so assessment is usually minimized or eliminated entirely.\n\nThe idea behind extensive reading is that a lot of reading of interesting material that is slightly below, at, or barely above the full comprehension level of the reader will foster improved language skills. Graded readers are often used. For foreign-language learners, some researchers have found that the use of glosses for \"difficult\" words is advantageous to vocabulary acquisition () but at least one study finds it has no effect (). A number of studies report significant incidental vocabulary gain in extensive reading in a foreign language (). Advocates claim it can enhance skill in speaking as well as in reading.\n\nStudents choose their own reading material and are not compelled to finish uninteresting materials. Reading material is normally for pleasure, information or general understanding; reading is its own reward with few or no follow-up exercises after reading; reading is individual and silent. Reading speed is usually faster when students read materials they can easily understand.\n\nNation(2005) suggests that learning from extensive reading should meet the following conditions: focusing on the meaning of the English text, understanding the type of learning that can occur through such reading, having interesting and engaging books, getting learners to do large quantities of reading at an appropriate level, and making sure that learning from reading is supported by other kinds of learning. In order to meet the conditions needed for learning from extensive reading at the students’ proficiency levels, it is essential to make use of simplified texts (Nation, 2005).\n\nThe teacher is a role model who also orients the students to the goals of the program, explains the idea and methodology, keeps records of what has been read, and guides students in material selection and maximizing the effect of the program.\n\nSome recent practitioners have not followed all of these traits, or have added to them, for example, requiring regular follow-up exercises such as story summaries or discussions and the use of audio materials in tandem with the readings ().\n\nA graded reader series of books that increase in difficulty from shorter texts using more common words in the first volumes, to longer texts with less common vocabulary in later volumes. cites Oxford's \"Bookworm series\", which includes the 2,500 most frequent words, The \"Longman Bridge Series\" (1945), with a systematic grading up to 8,000 words, now out of print, and the \"Penguin/Longman Active Reading\" series with its 3,000 word-family target.\n\nMany series of graded readers exist in English, and series exist also in French, German, Italian, and Spanish. , readers are notably absent or scarce in Russian, Arabic, Japanese, and Mandarin Chinese, though since 2006, an extensive reader series is available in Japanese. English readers have primarily been produced by British publishers, rather than American or other Anglophone nations. , only one small series (15 volumes) was published in the United States, and a few in Europe outside the UK, with the majority in the UK.\n\nThe following are some commercially available graded reader series in English:\n\nFor advocates of extensive reading, lack of reading selection is an acute issue in classical languages such as Latin – the main readings available being quite difficult and are perceived as dry. To increase the available literature and make more light selection available, modern literature (particularly children's literature, comics, and genre fiction) may be translated into classical languages – see list of Latin translations of modern literature for examples in Latin. As F. W. Newman writes in his introduction to a Latin translation of \"Robinson Crusoe\":\n\nLaufer suggests that 3,000 word families or 5,000 lexical items are the threshold (). Coady & Nation (1998) suggest 98% of lexical coverage and 5,000 word families or 8,000 items for a pleasurable reading (). After this threshold, the learner leaves the beginner paradox, and enters a virtuous circle (). Then, extensive reading becomes more efficient.\n\n, , and offer contrasting perspectives. All agree on the need of lexical input, but Cobb (2007; 2008) supported by denounces the sufficiency of extensive reading, the current lexical expansion pedagogy, especially for confirmed learners. According to Cobb (2007), 's Input Hypothesis states that extensive reading generates a continuous hidden learning (lexical input), eventually \"doing the entire job\" of vocabulary acquisition. This hypothesis is without empirical evidence, neither on the extent (% of global vocabulary acquisition), nor on the sufficiency of extensive reading for lexicon learning (Cobb 2007).\n\nCobb (2007) thus proposed a computer-based study to quantitatively assess the efficiency of extensive reading. Cobb estimated the reading quantity of common learners within the L2 language (~175,000 words over two years), then randomly took 10 words in each of the first thousand most frequent words, the second thousand, and the third thousand, to see how many times those words would appear. Those results should be higher than 6 to 10 encounters, the number needed for stable initial word learning to occur. Cobb (2007) summarizes as following: \"[the quantitative study] shows the extreme unlikelihood of developing an adequate L2 reading lexicon [above 2,000 words families] through reading alone, even in highly favorable circumstances\" since \"for the vast majority of L2 learners, free or wide reading alone is not a sufficient source of vocabulary knowledge for reading\". Thereafter, Cobb restated the need of lexical input, and stated the possibility to increase it using computing capabilities.\n\nMcQuillan & Krashen (2008) answer that learners may read far more than 175,000 words but rather +1,000,000 words in 2 years, but counters that view as being based on excessively successful cases of reading oversimplified texts. Experiments cited by McQuillan & Krashen use easy and fast to read texts, but not material suitable for discovering new vocabulary; unsimplified texts are far harder and slower to read.\n\nThe Extensive Reading Foundation is a not-for-profit, charitable organization whose purpose is to support and promote extensive reading. One of its initiatives is the annual Language Learner Literature Award for the best new works in English. Another is maintaining a bibliography of research on extensive reading. The Foundation is also interested in helping educational institutions set up extensive reading programs through grants that fund the purchase of books and other reading material.\n\nThe Extensive Reading Special Interest Group (ER SIG) of the Japan Association for Language Teaching is a not-for-profit organization which exists to help promote Extensive Reading in Japan. Via a website, the publications \"Extensive Reading in Japan\" and \"Journal of Extensive Reading\", presentations throughout Japan, and other activities, the ER SIG aims to help teachers set up and make the most of their ER programs and ER research projects.\n\nSimilar to extensive reading is \"extensive listening\", which is the analogous approach to listening. One issue is that listening speed is generally slower than reading speed, so simpler texts are recommended – one may be able to read a text extensively, but not be able to listen to it extensively.\n\n\n\nA series of periodic surveys of graded extensive readers in English have been undertaken by Helen C. Reid Thomas and David R. Hill, which provide a good overview of the evolving state of available readers.\n\n"}

{"id": "649481", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=649481", "title": "Film industry", "text": "Film industry\n\nThe film industry or motion picture industry, comprises the technological and commercial institutions of filmmaking, i.e., film production companies, film studios, cinematography, animation, film production, screenwriting, pre-production, post production, film festivals, distribution and actors, film directors and other film crew personnel.\n\nThough the expense involved in making films almost immediately led film production to concentrate under the auspices of standing production companies, advances in affordable film making equipment, and expansion of opportunities to acquire investment capital from outside the film industry itself, have allowed independent film production to evolve. Hollywood is the oldest film industry of the world, and the largest in terms of box office gross revenue. Indian cinema (including Bollywood) is the largest film industry in terms of the number of films produced and the number of tickets sold, with 3.5 billion tickets sold worldwide annually (compared to Hollywood's 2.6 billion tickets sold annually) and 1,986 feature films produced annually.\n\nThe worldwide theatrical market had a box office of in 2016. The top three continents/regions by box office gross were: Asia-Pacific with , the U.S. and Canada with , and Europe, the Middle East and North Africa with . , the largest markets by box office were, in decreasing order, the United States, China, Japan, India, and the United Kingdom. , the countries with the largest number of film productions were India, Nigeria, and the United States. In Europe, significant centers of movie production are France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom.\n\nDistinct from the centers are the locations where movies are filmed. Because of labor and infrastructure costs, many films are produced in countries other than the one in which the company which pays for the film is located. For example, many U.S. movies are filmed in Canada, many Nigerian movies are filmed in Ghana, while many Indian movies are filmed in the Americas, Europe, Singapore etc.\n\nThe cinema of the United States, often generally referred to as Hollywood, has had a profound effect on cinema across the world since the early 20th century. The United States cinema (Hollywood) is the oldest film industry in the world which originated more than 121 years ago and also the largest film industry in terms of revenue. Hollywood is the primary nexus of the U.S. film industry with established film study facilities such as the American Film Institute, LA Film School and NYFA being established in the area. However, four of the six major film studios are owned by East Coast companies. The major film studios of Hollywood including Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 20th Century Fox, Paramount Pictures and Lightstorm Entertainment are the primary source of the most commercially successful movies in the world, such as \"Star Wars\" (1977), and \"Titanic\" (1997).\n\nAmerican film studios today collectively generate several hundred movies every year, making the United States one of the most prolific producers of films in the world. Only The Walt Disney Company — which owns the Walt Disney Studios — is fully based in Southern California. And while Sony Pictures Entertainment is headquartered in Culver City, California, its parent company, the Sony Corporation, is headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. Most shooting now takes place in California, New York, Louisiana, Georgia and North Carolina. Hollywood is the most popular film industry with the highest number of screens, and is the highest-grossing film industry in the world. Between 2009-2015, Hollywood consistently grossed $10 billion (or more) annually. Hollywood's award ceremony, the Academy Awards, officially known as The Oscars, is held by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) every year and a total of 2,947 Oscars have been awarded since the inception of the award.\n\nThe earliest documented account of an exhibition of projected motion pictures in the United States was in June 1894 in Richmond, Indiana by Charles Francis Jenkins which makes United States cinema the earliest cinema in the whole world. Jenkins used his Phantoscope to project his film before an audience of family, friends and reporters. The film featured a vaudeville dancer performing a Butterfly Dance. Jenkins and his new partner Thomas Armat modified the Phantoscope for exhibitions in temporary theaters at the Cotton States Exposition in the fall of 1895. The Phantoscope was later sold to Thomas Edison, who changed the name of the projector to Edison's Vitascope.\n\nNestor Studios was Hollywood's first movie studio, founded on 27 October 1911. It was built by David Horsley for Nestor Motion Picture Company. It was then owned and operated by David Horsley and his brother, William Horsley. The first motion picture stage in Hollywood was built behind the tavern. Other East Coast studios had moved production to Los Angeles, prior to Nestor's move\nwest. The California weather allowed for year-round filming and the ambitious studio operated three principal divisions under its Canadian-born general manager, Al Christie. Other filmmakers began opening studios in the Hollywood area. The Horsleys operated the Nestor Studios at the Sunset and Gower location until 20 May 1912, when the Universal Studios was formed, headed by Carl Laemmle. Nestor, along with several other motion picture companies, including Laemmle's Independent Moving Pictures (IMP), was merged with Universal.\n\nThe Cinema of China is one of three distinct historical threads of Chinese-language cinema together with the cinema of Hong Kong and the cinema of Taiwan. Cinema was introduced in China in 1896 and the first Chinese film, \"The Battle of Dingjunshan\", was made in 1905, with the film industry being centered on Shanghai in the first decades. China is the home of the largest film studio in the world, the Hengdian World Studios, and in 2010 it had the third largest film industry by number of feature films produced annually. For the next decade the production companies were mainly foreign-owned, and the domestic film industry was centered on Shanghai, a thriving entrepot and the largest city in the Far East. In 1913, the first independent Chinese screenplay, \"The Difficult Couple\", was filmed in Shanghai by Zheng Zhengqiu and Zhang Shichuan.\n\nAs the Sixth Generation gained international exposure, many subsequent movies were joint ventures and projects with international backers, but remained quite resolutely low-key and low budget. Jia's \"Platform\" (2000) was funded in part by Takeshi Kitano's production house, while his \"Still Life\" was shot on HD video. \"Still Life\" was a surprise addition and Golden Lion winner of the 2006 Venice International Film Festival. \"Still Life\", which concerns provincial workers around the Three Gorges region, sharply contrasts with the works of Fifth Generation Chinese directors like Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige who were at the time producing \"House of Flying Daggers\" (2004) and \"The Promise\" (2005). It featured no star of international renown and was acted mostly by non-professionals. In 2012 the country became the second-largest market in the world by box office receipts. In 2014, the gross box office in China was ¥29.6 billion (US$4.82 billion), with domestic films having a share of 55%. The country is predicted to have the largest market in the world in 2017 or 2018. China has also become a major hub of business for Hollywood studios. In 2013, China's gross box office was ¥21.8 billion (US$3.6 billion), the second-largest film market in the world by box office receipts whereas in 2014, China's box office gross was $4.8 Billion, being the second largest box office grosser in film industry.\n\nIndia is the largest producer of films in the world and second oldest film industry in the world which originated around about 105 years ago. In 2009 India produced a total of 2,961 films on celluloid; this figure includes 1,288 feature films. Besides being the largest producer of films in the world, India also has the largest number of admissions. Indian film industry is multi-lingual and the largest in the world in terms of ticket sales but 3rd largest in terms of revenue mainly due to having amongst the lowest ticket prices in the world. The industry is viewed mainly by a vast film-going Indian public, and Indian films have been gaining increasing popularity in the rest of the world—notably in countries with large numbers of expatriate Indians. Indian film industry is also the dominant source of movies and entertainment in its neighboring countries of South Asia. The largest film and most popular industry in India is the Hindi film industry mostly concentrated in Mumbai (Bombay), and is commonly referred to as Bollywood, an amalgamation of Bombay and Hollywood.\n\nThe other largest film industries are Tamil cinema, Telugu cinema, Kannada cinema, Malayalam cinema, Bangla cinema (cinema of West Bengal) and Marathi cinema, which are located in Chennai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Kochi, Kolkata and Mumbai. The remaining majority portion is spread across northern, western, and southern India (with Gujarati, Punjabi, Oriya, Bhojpuri, Assamese Cinema). However, there are several smaller centers of Indian film industries in regional languages centered in the states where those languages are spoken. Indian films are made filled with musicals, action, romance, comedy, and an increasing number of special effects. It encloses a number of several artforms like Indian classical music, folk music of different regions throughout the country, Indian classical dance, folk dance and much more. It is even the place for number of artists from the Indian subcontinent to showcase their talent. The Indian film industry produces more than 1000 films a year. Bollywood is the largest portion of this and is viewed all over the Indian Subcontinent, and is increasingly popular in UK, United States, Australia, New Zealand, Southeast Asia, Africa, the Gulf countries, European countries and China. The largest film studio complex in the world is Ramoji Film City located at Hyderabad, India, which opened in 1996 and measures 674 ha (1,666 acres). Comprising 47 sound stages, it has permanent sets ranging from railway stations to temples.\n\nBollywood represents 43% of Indian net box office revenue, while Telugu and Tamil cinema represent 36%, and the rest of the regional cinema constitute 21%, .\n\nThe highest-grossing movie of India is Dangal which is also the 5th highest grossing non-English movie in the world.\n\nThe cinema of Nigeria, often referred to informally as Nollywood, was the second largest film industry, in terms of output, in 2009 and the third largest, in terms of overall revenues generated, in 2013. Its history dates back to as early as the late 19th century and into the colonial era in the early 20th century. The history and development of the Nigerian motion picture industry is sometimes generally classified in four main eras: the Colonial era, Golden Age, Video film era and the emerging New Nigerian cinema.\n\nFilm as a medium first arrived Nigeria in the late 19th century, in the form of peephole viewing of motion picture devices. These were soon replaced in the early 20th century with improved motion picture exhibition devices, with the first set of films screened at the Glover Memorial Hall in Lagos from 12 to 22 August 1903. The earliest feature film made in Nigeria is the 1926 \"Palaver\" produced by Geoffrey Barkas; the film was also the first film ever to feature Nigerian actors in speaking roles. The first film entirely copyrighted to the Nigerian Film unit is \"Fincho\" (1957) by Sam Zebba; which is also the first Nigerian film to be shot in colour.\n\nAfter Nigeria's independence in 1960, the cinema business rapidly expanded, with new cinema houses being established. As a result, Nigerian content in theatres increased in the late 1960s into the 1970s, especially productions from Western Nigeria, owing to former theatre practitioners such as Hubert Ogunde and Moses Olaiya transitioning into the big screen. In 1972, the \"Indigenization Decree\" was issued by Yakubu Gowon, which demands the transfer of ownership of about a total of 300 film theatres from their foreign owners to Nigerians, which resulted in more Nigerians playing active roles in the cinema and film. The oil boom of 1973 through 1978 also contributed immensely to the spontaneous boost of the cinema culture in Nigeria, as the increased purchasing power in Nigeria made a wide range of citizens to have disposable income to spend on cinema going and on home television sets.\n\nAfter the decline of the Golden era, Nigerian film industry experienced a second major boom in the 1990s, supposedly marked by the release of the direct-to-video film \"Living in Bondage\" (1992); the industry peaked in the mid 2000s to become the second largest film industry in the world in terms of the number of annual film productions, placing it ahead of the United States and behind only India. The films started dominating screens across the African continent and by extension, the Caribbeans and the diaspora, with the movies significantly influencing cultures, and the film actors becoming household names across the continent. The boom also led to a backlash against Nigerian films in several countries, bordering on theories such as the \"Nigerialization of Africa\". Since the mid-2000s, the Nigerian cinema have undergone some restructuring to promote quality and professionalism, with \"The Figurine\" (2009) widely regarded as marking the major turn around of contemporary Nigerian cinema. There has since been a resurgence in the proliferation of cinema establishments, and a steady return of the cinema culture in Nigeria.\n\nThe 2016 film The Wedding Party, directed by Kemi Adetiba, is the highest grossing Nollywood film of all time.\n\nSince 1976, Cairo has held the annual Cairo International Film Festival (CIFF), which is accredited by the International Federation of Film Producers Association. In 1996, the Egyptian Media Production City (EMPC) was inaugurated in 6th of October City south of Cairo, although by 2001, only one of 29 planned studios was operational. Censorship, formerly an obstacle to freedom of expression, has decreased remarkably by 2012, when the Egyptian cinema had begun to tackle boldly issues ranging from sexual issues to heavy government criticism.\n\nThe 1940s, 1950s and the 1960s are generally considered the golden age of Egyptian cinema. As in the West, films responded to the popular imagination, with most falling into predictable genres (happy endings being the norm), and many actors making careers out of playing strongly typed parts. In the words of one critic, \"If an Egyptian film intended for popular audiences lacked any of these prerequisites, it constituted a betrayal of the unwritten contract with the spectator, the results of which would manifest themselves in the box office.\" Since the 1990s, Egypt's cinema has gone in separate directions. Smaller art films attract some international attention but sparse attendance at home. Popular films, often broad comedies such as \"What A Lie!\", and the extremely profitable works of comedian Mohamed Saad, battle to hold audiences either drawn to Western films or, increasingly, wary of the perceived immorality of film.\n\nThe cinema of Iran (Persian: \"سینمای ایران\") or cinema of Persia refers to the cinema and film industries in Iran which produce a variety of commercial films annually. Iranian art films have garnered international fame and now enjoy a global following.\n\nAlong with China, Iran has been lauded as one of the best exporters of cinema in the 1990s. Some critics now rank Iran as the world's most important national cinema, artistically, with a significance that invites comparison to Italian neorealism and similar movements in past decades. A range of international film festivals have honored Iranian cinema in the last twenty years. Austrian filmmaker Michael Haneke and German filmmaker Werner Herzog have praised Iranian cinema as one of the world's most important artistic cinemas.\n\nSee Cinema of Japan\n\nThe term \"cinema of Korea\" (or \"Korean cinema\") encompasses the motion picture industries of North and South Korea. As with all aspects of Korean life during the past century, the film industry has often been at the mercy of political events, from the late Joseon dynasty to the Korean War to domestic governmental interference. While both countries have relatively robust film industries today, only South Korean films have achieved wide international acclaim. North Korean films tend to portray their communist or revolutionary themes.\n\nSouth Korean films enjoyed a \"Golden age\" during the late 1950s, and 1960s, but by the 1970s had become generally considered to be of low quality. Nonetheless, by 2005 South Korea had become one of few nations to watch more domestic than imported films in theatres due largely to laws placing limits on the number of foreign films able to be shown per theatre per year. In the theaters, Korean films must be played for 73 days per year since 2006. On cable TV 25% domestic film quota will be reduced to 20% after KOR-US FTA.\nThe cinema of South Korea had a total box office gross in the country in 2015 of ₩ and had 113,000,000 admissions, 52% of the total admissions.\n\nHong Kong is a filmmaking hub for the Chinese-speaking world (including the worldwide diaspora) and East Asia in general. For decades it was the third largest motion picture industry in the world (after Bollywood and Hollywood) and the second largest exporter of films. Despite an industry crisis starting in the mid-1990s and Hong Kong's return to Chinese sovereignty in July 1997 Hong Kong film has retained much of its distinctive identity and continues to play a prominent part on the world cinema stage.\nUnlike many film industries, Hong Kong has enjoyed little to no direct government support, through either subsidies or import quotas. It has always been a thoroughly commercial cinema, concentrating on crowd-pleasing genres, like comedy and action, and heavily reliant on formulas, sequels and remakes. Typically of commercial cinemas, its heart is a highly developed star system, which in this case also features substantial overlap with the pop music industry.\n\nThe Yeşilçam film industry is the second largest European theatrical growth market and the 7th largest theatrical market in terms of admissions, only superseded by the ‘big 5’ EU markets and the Russian Federation. The Turkish film market also stands out in the pan-European landscape as the only market where national films regularly outperform US films. It had 1.2 million number of admissions in film industry and 87 feature films were released in the year 2013. Because of the exceptional box office success of Turkish films on the domestic market, the estimated 12.9 million admissions generated on non-national European markets only account for 7% of total admissions to Turkish films in Europe (including Turkey) between 2004 and 2013. This is the third lowest share among the 30 European markets for which such data are available and clearly illustrates the strong dependence of Turkish films on the domestic market, a feature which is shared by Polish and Russian films.\n\nOver the past ten years an increasing number of Turkish films and filmmakers have been selected for international film festivals and received a large number of awards, like Kış Uykusu (Winter's Sleep) won Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Film in 2014. In terms of box office Turkey still ranks behind the Netherlands with just over EUR 200 million as Europe's eight largest box office market ahead of Sweden and Switzerland with a clear gap to the top 6 markets all of which registered GBO between EUR 504 million (Spain) up to over EUR 1 billion in France, the UK, Germany and the Russian Federation. Cinema going is comparatively cheap in Turkey. In 2013 a cinema ticket cost on average EUR 4.0 in Turkey, and this is estimated to be the lowest average ticket price - measured in Euro - in Europe, marginally cheaper than in several Central and Eastern European markets like Croatia, Romania, Lithuania or Bulgaria. When comparing ticket prices in Euro, one of course has to take into consideration that these comparisons are significantly affected by fluctuations in the exchange rates of the various currencies. Because of devaluation of the Turkish Lira against the Euro, average ticket prices measured in Euro remained fairly stable over the past 10 years.\n\nThe cinema of Pakistan, or simply, Pakistani cinema () refers to Pakistan's film industry. Most of the feature films shot in Pakistan are in Urdu, the national language, but may also include films in English, the official language, and regional languages such as Punjabi, Pashto, Balochi, and Sindhi. Lahore has been described as the epicentre of Pakistani cinema, giving rise to the term \"Lollywood.\"\n\nBefore the separation of Bangladesh, Pakistan had three main film production centres: Lahore, Karachi and Dhaka. The regime of Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, VCRs, film piracy, the introduction of entertainment taxes, strict laws based upon ultra-conservative jurisprudence, was an obstacle to the industry's growth. Once thriving, the cinema in Pakistan had a sudden collapse in the 1980s and by the 2000s \"an industry that once produced an average of 80 films annually was now struggling to even churn out more than two films a year.\". However, the industry has recently made a dramatic and remarkable comeback, evident from the fact that 18 of the 21 highest grossing Pakistani movies were released from 2013 through to the present, with Pakistani films frequently outcompeting Bollywood movies for the Pakistani audience, the industry is supported by Pakistani channels such as ARY and Geo whose entertainment divisions have invested significantly in Pakistani cinema when expanding from providing news and entertainment on TV channels, the lifting of strict regulations on production of films and reduction of taxes on cinemas helped to fuel an expansion across the industry from which the film industry has seen a revival.\n\nThe cinema of Bangladesh is the Bengali language film industry based in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The industry often has been a significant film industry since the early 1970s. The word \"Dhallywood\" is a portmanteau of the words Dhaka and Hollywood. The dominant style of Bangladeshi cinema is Melodramatic cinema, which developed from 1947 to 1990 and characterizes most films to this day. Cinema was introduced in Bangladesh in 1898 by Bradford Bioscope Company, credited to have arranged the first film release in Bangladesh. Between 1913 and 1914, the first production company named Picture House was opened. A short silent film titled \"Sukumari\" (\"The Good Girl\") was the first produced film in the region during 1928. The first full-length film \"The Last Kiss\", was released in 1931. From the separation of Bangladesh from Pakistan, Dhaka is the center of Bangladeshi film industry, and generated the majority share of revenue, production and audiences. The 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and the first half of the 1990s were the golden years for Bangladeshi films as the industry produced many successful films. \"The Face and the Mask\", the first Bengali language Bangladeshi full-length feature film was produced in 1956.\n\nDirectors such as Fateh Lohani, Zahir Raihan, Alamgir Kabir, Khan Ataur Rahman, Subhash Dutta, Ritwik Ghatak, Ehtesham, Chashi Nazrul Islam, Abdullah al Mamun, Sheikh Niamat Ali, Gazi Mazharul Anwar, Tanvir Mokammel, Tareque Masud, Morshedul Islam, Humayun Ahmed, Gias Uddin Selim, Amitabh Reza Chowdhury and others have made significant contributions to Bangladeshi mainstream cinema, parallel cinema, art films and won global acclaim.\n\nThe biggest film studios in Southeast Asia has been soft opened on 5 November 2011 on 10 hectares of land in Nongsa, Batam Island, Indonesia. Infinite Frameworks (IFW) is a Singapore-based company (closed to Batam Island) which is owned by a consortium with 90 percent of it hold by Indonesian businessman and movie producer, Mike Wiluan. In 2010-2011, due to the substantial increase in value added tax applied to foreign films, cinemas no longer had access to many foreign films, including Oscar-winning films. Foreign films include major box offices from the west, and other major film producers of the world. This has caused a massive ripple effect on the country's economy. It is assumed that this increases the purchase of unlicensed DVDs. However, even copyright violating DVDs took longer to obtain. The minimum cost to view a foreign film not screened locally, was 1 million Rupiah. This is equivalent to US$100, as it includes a plane ticket to Singapore.\n\nTrinidad and Tobago's film sector began emerging in the late fifties to early sixties and by the late seventies, there were a handful of local productions, both feature film and television. The first full-length feature film to be produced in Trinidad and Tobago was “The Right and the Wrong” (1970) by Indian director/writer/producer, Harbance Kumar. The screenplay was written by the Trinidadian playwright, Freddie Kissoon. The rest of the 20th century saw a couple more feature films being made in the country, with “Bim” (1974), being singled out by Bruce Paddington as \"one of the most important films to be produced in Trinidad and Tobago….and one of the classics of Caribbean cinema.” It was one of the first films to feature an almost entirely Trinidadian cast and crew. There was a rise in Trinidadian film production in the 2000s. Movies such as “Ivan the Terrible” (2004), “SistaGod” (2006), “I’m Santana: The Movie” (2012) and “God Loves the Fighter” (2013) were released both locally and internationally. “SistaGod” had its world premiere at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nThe Trinidad and Tobago Film Company is the national agency that was established in 2006 to further development of the film industry. Trinidad and Tobago puts on a number of film festivals which are organized by different committees and organizations. These include the Secondary Schools Short Film Festival and Smartphone Film Festival organized by Trinidad and Tobago Film Company. There is also an annual Trinidad and Tobago Film Festival which runs for two weeks in the latter half of September.\n\nNepali film does not have a very long movie history, but the industry has its own place in the cultural heritage of the country. It is often referred to as 'Nepali Chalchitra' (which translates to \"Nepali movies\" in English). The terms Kollywood and Kallywood are also used, as a portmanteau of \"Kathmandu\" and \"Hollywood\"; \"Kollywood\" however is more frequently used to refer to Tamil cinema.[1] Chhakka Panja has been considered the highest-grossing movie of all time in Nepali Movie Industry and Kohinoor the second highest. Nepali movies has recently begun receiving international acclaim with films such as The Black Hen (2015), Kagbeni (2006) and others. Nepali feature film White Sun (Seto Surya) has bagged the Best Film award at the 27th Singapore International Film Festival (SGIFF)(2016).\n\nThe Film Development Board (FDB) was established by the Government of Nepal for the development and promotion of the Nepali film industry. The Board is a liaison to facilitate the conceptualization, making, distribution and exhibition of Nepali films nationally. The Board attempts to bridge the gap between film entrepreneurship and government bureaucracy. The Board is a balance between the people at large, the government, and the process of film making. It is intended to act as the safeguard of the interests of the people, the watchdog of the government, and the advocate of filmmakers.\n\nThe first feature film to be made was the 1906 Australian silent \"The Story of the Kelly Gang\", an account of the notorious gang led by Ned Kelly that was directed and produced by the Melburnians Dan Barry and Charles Tait. It ran, continuously, for eighty minutes.\n\nIn the early 1910s, the film industry had fully emerged with D.W. Griffith's \"The Birth of a Nation\". Also in the early 1900s motion picture production companies from New York and New Jersey started moving to California because of the good weather and longer days. Although electric lights existed at that time, none were powerful enough to adequately expose film; the best source of illumination for movie production was natural sunlight. Besides the moderate, dry climate, they were also drawn to the state because of its open spaces and wide variety of natural scenery.\n\nThe earliest documented account of an exhibition of projected motion pictures in the United States was in June 1894 in Richmond, Indiana by Charles Francis Jenkins. The first movie studio in the Hollywood area, Nestor Studios, was founded in 1911 by Al Christie for David Horsley in an old building on the northwest corner of Sunset Boulevard and Gower Street. In the same year, another fifteen Independents settled in Hollywood. Hollywood came to be so strongly associated with the film industry that the word \"Hollywood\" came to be used colloquially to refer to the entire industry.\n\nIn 1913 Cecil B. DeMille, in association with Jesse Lasky, leased a barn with studio facilities on the southeast corner of Selma and Vine Streets from the Burns and Revier Studio and Laboratory, which had been established there. DeMille then began production of \"The Squaw Man\" (1914). It became known as the Lasky-DeMille Barn and is currently the location of the Hollywood Heritage Museum.\n\nThe Charlie Chaplin Studios, on the northeast corner of La Brea and De Longpre Avenues just south of Sunset Boulevard, was built in 1917. It has had many owners after 1953, including Kling Studios, which housed production for the \"Superman\" TV series with George Reeves; Red Skelton, who used the sound stages for his CBS TV variety show; and CBS, who filmed the TV series \"Perry Mason\" with Raymond Burr there. It has also been owned by Herb Alpert's A&M Records and Tijuana Brass Enterprises. It is currently The Jim Henson Company, home of the Muppets. In 1969 The Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Board named the studio a historical cultural monument.\n\nThe famous Hollywood Sign originally read \"Hollywoodland.\" It was erected in 1923 to advertise a new housing development in the hills above Hollywood. For several years the sign was left to deteriorate. In 1949 the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce stepped in and offered to remove the last four letters and repair the rest.\n\nThe sign, located at the top of Mount Lee, is now a registered trademark and cannot be used without the permission of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, which also manages the venerable Walk of Fame.\n\nThe first Academy Awards presentation ceremony took place on 16 May 1929, during a banquet held in the Blossom Room of the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel on Hollywood Boulevard. Tickets were USD $10.00 and there were 250 people in attendance.\n\nFrom about 1930 five major Hollywood movie studios from all over the Los Angeles area, Paramount, RKO, 20th Century Fox, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Warner Bros., owned large, grand theaters throughout the country for the exhibition of their movies. The period between the years 1927 (the effective end of the silent era) to 1948 is considered the age of the \"Hollywood studio system\", or, in a more common term, the \"Golden Age of Hollywood\". In a landmark 1948 court decision, the Supreme Court ruled that movie studios could not own theaters and play only the movies of their studio and movie stars, thus an era of Hollywood history had unofficially ended. By the mid-1950s, when television proved a profitable enterprise that was here to stay, movie studios started also being used for the production of programming in that medium, which is still the norm today.\n\nBollywood is the Hindi-language film industry based in Mumbai (formerly known as Bombay), Maharashtra, India. The term is often incorrectly used to refer to the whole of Indian cinema; however, it is only a part of the total Indian film industry, which includes other production centres producing films in multiple languages. Bollywood is the largest film producer in India and one of the largest centres of film production in the world.\n\nBollywood is formally referred to as Hindi cinema. Linguistically, Bollywood films tend to use a colloquial dialect of Hindi-Urdu, or Hindustani, mutually intelligible to both Hindi and Urdu speakers, while modern Bollywood films also increasingly incorporate elements of Hinglish.\n\n\"The Wrestlers\" (1899) and \"The Man and His Monkeys\" (1899), directed and produced by Harischandra Sakharam Bhatawdekar (H. S. Bhatavdekar), were the first two films made by Indian filmmakers, which were both short films. He was also the first Indian filmmaker to direct and produce the first documentary and news related film, titled \"The Landing of Sir M.M. Bhownuggree\".\n\n\"Pundalik\" (\"Shree Pundalik\") (1912), by Dadasaheb Torne alias Rama Chandra Gopal, and \"Raja Harishchandra\" (1913), by Dadasaheb Phalke, were the first and second silent feature films respectively made in India. By the 1930s the industry was producing more than 200 films per annum. The first Indian sound film, Ardeshir Irani's \"Alam Ara\" (1931), was a major commercial success. There was clearly a huge market for talkies and musicals; Bollywood and all the regional film industries quickly switched to sound filming. \"Joymoti (1935 film)\" by Jyoti Prasad Agarwalla was the first Indian dubbed film, released in Calcutta on 10 March 1935. Till then, all dialogues of all talkies were had to be recorded at locations during the shooting of the film. Through \"Joymoti (1935 film)\", dubbing technology was successfully introduced to Indian cinema by Assamese filmmaker Jyoti Prasad Agarwalla.\n\nThe 1930s and 1940s were tumultuous times: India was buffeted by the Great Depression, World War II, the Indian independence movement, and the violence of the Partition. Most Bollywood films were unabashedly escapist, but there were also a number of filmmakers who tackled tough social issues, or used the struggle for Indian independence as a backdrop for their plots.\n\nIn 1937 Ardeshir Irani, of \"Alam Ara\" fame, made the first colour film in Hindi, \"Kisan Kanya\". The next year, he made another colour film, a version of \"Mother India\". However, colour did not become a popular feature until the late 1950s. At this time, lavish romantic musicals and melodramas were the staple fare at the cinema.\n\nFollowing India's independence, the period from the late 1940s to the early 1960s is regarded by film historians as the \"Golden Age\" of Hindi cinema. Defining key figures during this time included Raj Kapoor, Guru Dutt, Mehboob Khan, and Dilip Kumar.\n\nThe 1970s was when the name \"Bollywood\" was coined, and when the quintessential conventions of commercial Bollywood films were established. Key to this was the emergence of the masala film genre, which combines elements of multiple genres (action, comedy, romance, drama, melodrama, musical). The masala film was pioneered in the early 1970s by filmmaker Nasir Hussain, along with screenwriter duo Salim-Javed, pioneering the Bollywood blockbuster format.\n\nProfitability of a film studio is crucially dependent on picking the right film projects and involving the right management and creative teams (cast, direction, visual design, score, photography, costume, set design, editing, and many additional specialties), but it also depends heavily on choosing the right scale and approach to film promotion, control over receipts through technologies such as digital rights management (DRM), sophisticated accounting practices, and management of ancillary revenue streams; in the extreme, for a major media franchise centered on film, the film might itself be only one large component of many large contributions to total franchise revenue.\n\nSubstantial revenues might also derive from licensing efforts and other activities centered around the management of intellectual property; for this reason, various national film industries are heavily invested in the politics and legal specifics of multilateral trade agreements. Hollywood is a large enough industry to impact America's net balance of trade, offsetting some of the decline of employment in the manufacturing sector of the American economy since the early 1980s; typical of recent economic trends in first world economies, a large number of manufacturing jobs paying moderate wages are offset by a smaller number of creating jobs paying high wages. As an intellectual property industry, the film industry (along with the software industry) are central to modern globalization.\n\nThe film industry differs from software, however, in functioning primarily as a cultural export. English-language culture is the most globalized of all cultures, despite China and India having internal populations to rival the global English footprint. For this reason, Hollywood is the dominant film industry in globalism and trade. India has both a large film industry and a large, internal English-language culture, though Bollywood has not yet become a center for English-language film exports on a major scale. Films designed for global export tend to be films centered on action rather than dialogue, especially nuanced dialogue which is not fully available to people speaking English as a second language (ESL). Unusually, Japanese Anime has a global audience, though these are sometimes dubbed into English by star-power Hollywood voice actors.\n\nOn the creative side, picking the right projects has traditionally been regarded as high risk. Increasingly the risk is being mitigated with approaches drawn from advanced data analytics, such as using models derived from machine learning (sometimes glorified as AI) to estimate the future revenue of a proposed project.\n\nThe following is a list of the top 15 countries by the number of feature films (fiction, animation and documentary) produced, as determined by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics , unless otherwise noted.\n\n"}

{"id": "1291560", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1291560", "title": "Indo-Persian culture", "text": "Indo-Persian culture\n\nIndo-Persian culture refers to those Persian aspects that have been integrated into or absorbed into the cultures of the Indian subcontinent.\n\nPersian influence was first introduced to the Indian subcontinent by Muslim rulers of Turkic and Afghan origin, especially with the Delhi Sultanate from the 13th century, and in the 16th to 19th century by the Mughal Empire. In general, from its earliest days, aspects of the culture and language were brought to the Indian subcontinent by various Persianized Central Asian Turkic and Afghan rulers, such as Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi in the 11th century.\n\nPersian was the official language of the Delhi Sultanate, the Bahamani Sultanate, the Mughal Empire, and their successor states, as well as the cultured language of poetry and literature. Many of the Sultans and nobility in the Sultanate period were Persianised Turks from Central Asia who spoke Turkic languages as their mother tongues. The Mughals were also culturally Persianized Central Asians (of Turco-Mongol origin on their paternal side), but spoke Chagatai Turkic as their first language at the beginning, before eventually adopting Persian. Persian became the preferred language of the Muslim elite of north India. Muzaffar Alam, a noted scholar of Mughal and Indo-Persian history, suggests that Persian became the official \"lingua franca\" of the empire under Akbar for various political and social factors due to its non-sectarian and fluid nature. The influence of these languages led to a vernacular called Hindustani that is the ancestor of today's Urdu and Hindi.\n\nIndo-Persian culture has helped produce certain composite traditions within the Indian subcontinent that survive to this day, of which the Urdu language and literature is notable. The legacy of Indo-Persianate culture moreover can also be seen in much of the Mughal architecture within Lahore, Delhi and Agra, latterly of which the Taj Mahal is world-renowned. Hindustani classical music also received some influence from the Persian culture, but the nature of these influences remain unclear. In many ways, the absorption and assimilation of Persian or Persianate culture within India may be compared to the gradual (if sometimes problematic) absorption of English, British or Western culture generally of which the English language is perhaps the most notable and controversial within both India and Pakistan today. The influence of Persian language moreover may be seen in the considerable proportion of loanwords absorbed into the vernaculars of the north and north-west of the Indian subcontinent including Punjabi, Gujarati, Urdu, Hindi, Kashmiri and Pashto.\n\nWith the presence of Muslim culture in the region in the Ghaznavid period, Lahore and Uch were established as centers of Persian literature. Abu-al-Faraj Runi and Masud Sa'd Salman (d. 1121) were the two earliest major Indo-Persian poets based in Lahore. The earliest of the \"great\" Indo-Persian poets was Amir Khusrow (d. 1325) of Delhi, who has since attained iconic status within the Urdu speakers of the Indian subcontinent as, among other things, the \"father\" of Urdu literature.\n\nIndo-Persian culture and to varying degrees also Turkic culture flourished side-by-side during the period of the Delhi Sultanate (1206–1526). The invasion of Babur in 1526, the end of the Delhi Sultanate, and the establishment of what would become the Mughal Empire would usher the golden age of Indo-Persian culture with particular reference to the art and architecture of the Mughal era.\n\nThe Mughal Era to the British Raj: Persian persisted as the language of the Mughals up to and including the year 1707 which marked the death of the Emperor Aurangzeb, generally considered the last of the \"Great Mughals\". Thereafter, with the decline of the Mughal empire, the 1739 invasion of Delhi by Nader Shah and the gradual growth initially of the Hindu Marathas and later the European power within the Indian subcontinent, Persian or Persian culture commenced a period of decline although it nevertheless enjoyed patronage and may even have flourished within the many regional empires or kingdoms of the Indian subcontinent including that of the Sikh Maharaja Ranjit Singh (r. 1799–1837).\n\nPersian as a language of governance and education was abolished in 1839 by the British and the last Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar, even if his rule was purely symbolic or ceremonial, was overthrown in 1857 by the British.\n\nFurther, C.E. Bosworth wrote about the Central Asian's Persian (Tajiks→Ghurids) influence on India:\n\"...The sultans were generous patrons of the Persian literary traditions of Khorasan, and latterly fulfilled a valuable role as transmitters of this heritage to the newly conquered lands of northern India, laying the foundations for the essentially Persian culture which was to prevail in Muslim India until the 19th century...\"\n\nThe medieval Bahamani Sultanate and its successor Deccan sultanates of Central India had heavy Persian influence. The Bahamani sultans actively recruited Persian or Persianized men in their administration. Sultan Firuz (1397-1422) would send ships from his ports in Goa and Chaulto the Persian Gulf to bring back talented men of letters, administrators, jurists, soldiers and artisans. The high born Iranian Mahmud Gawan (1411-1481) who rose to become a powerful a powerful minister of that state during the reign of another Bahamani Sultan.\n\nAccording to Richard Eaton, even the Hindu Vijayanagara empire from the same period was highly Persianized in its Culture. The royal quarters of the capital had many Persian architectural elements such as domes and vaulted arches\n\nThe Bahmani Sultanate disintegrated into five Deccan Sultanates, similar in culture. Hyderabad, built by the Golconda Sultanate in the 16th century, was inspired from Isfahan. The use of Persian as a court language in Hyderabad continued under the Nizams of Hyderabad, and was only replaced by Urdu in 1886.\n\nThe court language during the Deccan sultanate period was Persian or Arabic, however, the local Marathi language was widely used during the period especially by Adil Shahi of Bijapur and the Ahmadnagar Sultanate. Although the rulers were Muslims, the local feudal landlords and the revenue collectors were Hindus and so was the majority of the population. Political expediency made it important for the sultans to make use of Marathi. Nevertheless, Marathi in official documents from the era is totally Persianised in its vocabulary. The Persian influence continues to this day with many Persian derived words used in every day speech such as bagh (Garden), karkhana (factory), Shahar (city), bāzār (market), dukān (shop), hoshiār (clever), kāḡhaz (paper), khurchi (< khurchi (chair), zamin (land), zahirāt (advertisement), and hazār (thousand).\n\nGiven that the Mughals had historically symbolized Indo-Persian culture to one degree or another, the overthrow of Bahadhur Shah Zafar and the institution of the British Raj in 1858 may be considered as marking the end of the Indo-Persian era, even if, after First War of Independence in 1857, Persian would still retain an audience and even produce commendable literature such as the philosophical poetry of Muhammad Iqbal (d. 1938). In Pakistan, Urdu and other regional languages retain extensive Persian vocabulary.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8479134", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8479134", "title": "Institute of Religion", "text": "Institute of Religion\n\nInstitutes of Religion are local organizations that provide religious education for young adults (ages 18–30) who are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Local institutes may function in church meetinghouses, but may also have a stand-alone building situated adjacent to colleges or universities (especially those found in the Mormon Corridor areas in the Western United States and Canada). The LDS Church describes the purpose of the Institute program as \"weekday religious instruction for single and married postsecondary students.\" Institutes of Religion are professionally directed as part of the Church Educational System, with responsibility for the seminary program and the church's higher education institutions, including Brigham Young University (BYU).\n\nIn addition to offering classes, Institutes often sponsor activities, such as dances, aimed at the needs of postsecondary students between 18–30 years old. Young adult church members are encouraged, although not required, to be enrolled in an Institute class whenever possible. In areas with a large LDS population, there are often special-needs Institutes that serve adults who have mental or physical handicaps. These Institutes adapt their curricula to meet individual student needs. \n\nAmong the standard Institute course offerings are classes on the Book of Mormon, Old Testament, New Testament, the Doctrine and Covenants, and other modern revelation. Institute classes are offered on campus at LDS higher education institutions, such as BYU. However, BYU students are required to take religion classes offered by the university. Students can transfer Institute course credit to BYU for a nominal charge and can graduate from the Institute program after completing 14 course credit hours.\n\nThe first Institute of Religion was established in 1926 in Moscow, Idaho, adjacent to the University of Idaho. Its first director was J. Wyley Sessions. There are currently 350,000 students in over 2,700 locations.\n\nEach institute has an Institute Director who is hired by Seminaries and Institutes of Religion (S&I). An Institute Council consists of students appointed by the local bishop or branch president. The Institute Council is a non-paid, voluntary position. Ultimate responsibility for the Institute program falls on the Church Board of Education, which is composed of the church's First Presidency, three members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and other leaders of the LDS Church.\n\nInstitute directors often cover large areas. At times Institute directors may be based at a large university with many LDS students and multiple classes where other teachers assist them, but they may also teach an institute class once a week at one or more other universities in the same general area with fewer LDS students. For example, as of fall 2009, the director of the LDS Institute of Religion in Ann Arbor, Michigan, taught one class a week at Eastern Michigan University and another weekly class at Wayne State University. These were each held on campus under the sponsorship of the LDS Student Association. The director also taught multiple classes at the institute building adjacent to the University of Michigan, while other classes were taught by an S&I missionary couple and part-time, volunteer instructors.\n\nBy the early 1990s, it was realized that young adults, especially young single adults, who did not attend college or were not currently in college could benefit from Institute. This included the fact that many schools had few LDS students attending them, and the nature of community colleges meant that there was not an easy concentration of LDS Students. In 1992, the church launched the expanded institute program, with the goal of having virtually every stake offer at least one institute class. These new institute classes were generally taught by volunteer instructors under the same lines of supervision as seminary teachers. The rule for attending institute was either being a young single adult or being a student. All single members of the LDS Church under the age of 31 were encouraged to attend institute where possible.\n\nStarting in the first years of the 21st century, and accelerating under the leadership of L. Tom Perry while he served as president of the Europe Central Area, the church developed a program called the \"Institute Outreach Center\", later renamed the \"Center for Young Adults\". This center focused on four aspects, including institute courses. The others included an activity council that would plan activities geared towards outreach, full-time missionaries who focused on reaching out to men and women of their own age group, and a senior missionary couple that would provide practical and spiritual guidance for the endeavor.\n\n\n"}

It offers four educational programmes: the IB Diploma Programme and the IB Career-related Programme for students aged 16 to 19, the IB Middle Years Programme for students aged 11 to 16, and the IB Primary Years Programme for children aged 3 to 12. To teach these programmes, schools must be authorized by the International Baccalaureate. \n\nThe organisation's name and logo were changed in 2007 to reflect a reorganisation. Consequently, \"IB\" may now refer to the organisation itself, any of the four programmes, or the diploma or certificates awarded at the end of a programme.\n\nWhen Marie-Thérèse Maurette wrote \"Educational Techniques for Peace. Do They Exist?\" in 1948, she created the framework for what would eventually become the IB Diploma Programme (IBDP). In the mid-1960s, a group of teachers from the International School of Geneva (Ecolint) created the International Schools Examinations Syndicate (ISES), which would later become the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO) and then the International Baccalaureate (IB).\n\nThe IB headquarters were officially established in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1968 for the development and maintenance of the IB Diploma Programme. The objective of this programme was to \"provide an internationally acceptable university admissions qualification suitable for the growing mobile population of young people whose parents were part of the world of diplomacy, international and multi-national organizations\" by offering standardized courses and assessments for students aged 16 to 19.\n\nInternational Baccalaureate North America (IBNA) was established in 1975 by Peter Nehr, International Baccalaureate Africa, Europe and Middle-East (IBAEM) in 1986, and International Baccalaureate Asia Pacific (IBAP) during the same period.\n\nThe IB Middle Years Programme (MYP) was first offered in 1994. Within five years, 51 countries had MYP schools. A revised MYP programme was introduced in September 2014.\n\nThe IB Primary Years Programme (PYP) was piloted in 1996 in 30 primary schools on different continents, and the first PYP school was authorised in 1997, with 87 authorised schools in 43 countries within five years.\n\nThe IB Career-related Programme (formerly IB Career-related Certificate) was first offered in 2012.\n\nAlec Peterson was IB's first director general (1968–1977), followed by Gérard Renaud (1977–1983), Roger Peel (1983–1998), Derek Blackman (1998–1999), George Walker (1999–2005), Jeffrey Beard (2006–2013) and Dr. Siva Kumari (appointed 2013, incumbent from 2014).\n\nAs the IB's mission in action, the learner profile concisely describes the aspirations of a global community that shares the values underlying the IB's educational philosophy. The IB learner profile describes the attributes and outcomes of education for international-mindedness. IB learners strive to be:\nThe learner profile is the basis for all four programmes.\n\nAge Range: 15–19\n\nDP Core\n\nSubject areas\n\nAge Range: 16–19\n\nThree-part framework\n\nCP Core\n\nAge range: 11–16\n\nSix global contexts\n\nEight subject areas\n\nCulminating activity for schools offering a 3- to 5-year program\n\nAge range: 3–12\n\nSix transdisciplinary themes\n\nSix subject areas\n\nFive essential elements\n\nThe IB is a not-for-profit educational foundation. The IB maintains its Foundation Office in Geneva, Switzerland. The Assessment Centre is located in Cardiff, Wales and the curriculum centre moved in 2011 to The Hague, Netherlands. Three Global Centres have been opened: Bethesda, Maryland (within the metropolitan area of Washington, DC) in the United States, Singapore and The Hague.\n\nThe organisation is divided into three regional centres: IB Africa, Europe and Middle East (IBAEM), administered from The Hague; IB Americas (IBA), administered from Bethesda; and IB Asia-Pacific (IBAP), administered from Singapore.\n\nSub-regional associations \"are groups formed by and for IB school practitioners to assist IB schools, teachers and students in their communities—from implementing IB programmes to providing a forum for dialogue.\" There are currently fifty-six (56) sub-regional associations, including:\n\nIn 2003, the IB established the IB Fund, incorporated in the United States, for the purpose of enhancing fundraising and keeping funds raised separate from operational funds. In 2004, the IB approved a strategic plan to \"ensure that programmes and services are of the highest quality\" and \"to provide access to people who are socio-economically disadvantaged.\" In 2010 and 2015 the strategic plans were updated after substantial consultation. The vision for the next 5 years was to more consciously establish the IB as a leader in international education and the Board outlined a vision and four strategic goals with key strategic objectives.\n\nAccess remains fundamental to the mission of the IB and a variety of initiatives and projects are helping to take it forward in Ecuador, Poland, Romania, the Czech Republic, South Africa, Kazakhstan, Spain, Malaysia, and Japan\n\nThe United States has the largest number of IB programmes (2,010 out of 5,586) offered in both private and public schools.\n\nThe IB works with governments and non-governmental organizations across the world and has consultative status as a non-governmental organisation (NGO) at United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and has collaborative relationships with the Council of Europe and the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie (OIF).\n\nThe IB governance is composed of an IB Board of Governors and six committees (access and advancement, audit, education, finance, human resources and governance). The Board of Governors appoints the Director General, sets the strategic direction of the organisation, adopts a mission statement, makes policy, oversees the IB's financial management, and ensures autonomy and integrity of the IB Diploma Programme examinations and other student assessment. The structure of its different committees are based on respect, representation and collaboration.\n\nThe Board of Governors can comprise between 15 and 25 members. Members are elected by the Board on the recommendation of the governance committee, and from nominations presented from the Heads Council, Regional Councils and the Board. To encourage diversity of gender, culture and geography, there are only three ex officio positions: Director General (non-voting), the chair of the Examining Board and the chair of the Heads Council.\n\nAdvisory bodies include the Heads Council and Regional Councils\n\n Some schools in the United States have eliminated the IBDP due to budgetary reasons and low student participation. In Utah in 2008, funding for the IBDP was reduced from $300,000 to $100,000 after State Senator Margaret Dayton objected to the program, stating, \"First, I have never espoused eliminating IB ... I don't want to create 'world citizens' nearly as much as I want to help cultivate American citizens who function well in the world.\" Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, meanwhile, believes that IB should be an option for students in Chicago Public Schools. Elizabeth Brackett reports on the IB in Chicago. A report by the University of Chicago concluded that Chicago Public School students who completed the IB programme were 40% more likely to attend a four-year college, 50% more likely to attend a selective four-year college, and significantly more likely to persist in college than their matched peers outside the program.\" The City of Miami Beach Commission entered into an education compact with Miami-Dade County Public Schools with one of the initiatives of the compact to implement the IB program throughout Miami Beach feeder schools.\n\nIn other parts of the world, IB programs have been well received, too. In 2013, The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan and the IB announced a plan that will expand the opportunities for Japanese students to complete the IB curriculum in Japanese. In Malaysia a project has been developed in response to interest expressed by the Malaysia Ministry of Education (MoE) in working with the IB to implement the IB Middle Years Programme (MYP) in select secondary state schools.\nThe Abu Dhabi Education Council (ADEC) signed an agreement with the IB in efforts to widen the options offered for parents and to meet the different needs of students in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). In April 2014 The King Faisal Foundation in Saudi Arabia and the IB signed a memorandum of understanding to develop IB programs, including the IBDP, in up to 40 primary and secondary schools, with the goal of developing these schools as centres of excellence as IB World Schools. In Peru President Ollanta Humala has committed to building a high performing schools network (COAR) made up of IB World Schools. In early 2016 13 new schools were authorized by the IB as part of this programme. In Ecuador, President Rafael Correa has also committed to improving education in state schools by implementing IB programmes and by January 2016 there were over 200 state schools. With support from local organisations, there are 13 state IB schools in Russia. In Spain, various models have been implemented (3 types of schools in Spain: public schools, private schools and state funded-private or ‘concerted’ schools) and led to extensive growth with 140 schools.\n\nInternationally the IB continues to be recognised as innovative, and in 2014 The World Innovation Summit for Education (WISE) announced the IB Career-related Certificate as a finalist for their annual WISE Awards.\n\nAccording to The IB's \"Find a World School\" list, as of July 2017 there are over 4900 schools offering one or more IB programmes.\nNotable schools include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe IB conducts its own research or commissions research from renowned universities or research institutions around the globe. Research is used to understand and track the implementation and impact of the IB's programmes or to support development of the programmes. There is also a wealth of third party research available:\n\nJeffrey Beard, a past director-general of International Baccalaureate, gave a talk on \"Education for a Better World\" on 5 August 2010 at the Chautauqua Institution in New York State. The institution issued a statement the next day in which it expressed \"genuine disappointment\" with the talk, noting that it \"drew heavily upon and quoted extensively from a speech given earlier in the year by Sir Ken Robinson\", while adding that he \"neglected to cite his source or reveal the quotations for what they were\". Ken Robinson is a renowned British educationist who lives in the United States. Through an IB spokesperson, Beard admitted that \"he could have been more explicit about the sources and authors that inspired him for the content of this speech\". In a letter sent to heads of schools that offer the IB curricula, he described this as an \"unfortunate incident\" due to an \"oversight\".\n\nIn an apparently unrelated development, the \"Times Educational Supplement\" revealed on 8 October 2010, that significant portions of one of IB's marking guides for the IB Diploma Programme was lifted wholesale from unattributed websites, including Wikipedia. In a letter to schools, IB director-general Beard wrote: \"We have and always will take immediate and appropriate action when we discover any violation of our policies or standards.\" The examiner responsible for the plagiarism resigned from the examination board five weeks after the issue came to light.\n\n"}
{"id": "43307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43307", "title": "K-19: The Widowmaker", "text": "K-19: The Widowmaker\n\nK-19: The Widowmaker is a 2002 historical submarine film about the first of many disasters that befell the Soviet submarine \"K-19\".\n\n\"K-19: The Widowmaker\" was directed by Kathryn Bigelow, and stars Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson. The screenplay was adapted by Christopher Kyle, with the story written by Louis Nowra, based on real-life events depicted in a book by Peter Huchthausen. The film is an international co-production between the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Canada.\n\nIn 1961, the Soviet Union launches its first ballistic missile nuclear submarine, the \"K-19\", commanded by Captain Alexei Vostrikov (Harrison Ford), aided by executive officer Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson). Polenin was the crew's original captain, and they have served together for some time; Vostrikov's appointment is alleged to have been aided by his wife's political connections, as well as Polenin's tendency to put the crew's morale and safety before the pride of the Soviet Union. During his first inspection, Vostrikov discovers the reactor officer to be drunk and asleep on duty and sacks him, ordering Polenin to request a replacement.\n\nThe replacement reactor officer, Vadim Radtchenko (Peter Sarsgaard), is fresh from the naval academy's nuclear program. Before the launch, the medical officer is killed when struck by an oncoming truck, and is replaced by command's foremost medical officer, who hails from the army and has never been out to sea. During the official launch of the \"K-19\", the bottle of champagne fails to break when it strikes the bow, considered to be a sign of ill fortune (according to some naval traditions, a young woman is supposed to break a bottle of alcoholic/celebratory beverage against a ship's hull at its christening/maiden launch; if the bottle did not break, it was taken to be an ill omen).\n\nWith Captain Vostrikov's constant drilling, the crew's performance improves. The first mission of the \"K-19\" is to surface in the Arctic to fire an unarmed intercontinental ballistic missile as a test, then to patrol a zone in the Atlantic within striking range of New York City and Washington, D.C. as a Soviet deterrent to American ambitions. To test the submarine's limits, Vostrikov orders the \"K-19\" to submerge past its maximum operational depth of 250 meters to a depth closer to its \"crush depth\" (300 meters), then surface rapidly at full-speed to break through the Arctic pack-ice, estimated at no more than one meter thick. Polenin regards this maneuver as dangerous and storms off the bridge. Scraping along the underside of the ice, the \"K-19\" breaks through with little difficulty. The test missile is launched successfully.\n\nEn route to the patrolling area, a pipe for the reactor cooling system springs a leak and then bursts completely. Control rods are inserted to stop the reactor, but without coolant the reactor temperature continues to rise rapidly. During an officers' review of emergency protocols, it is revealed that back-up coolant systems were not installed; without these, the protocols are useless (they are based on the assumption that back-up systems are in place). The \"K-19\" surfaces to contact fleet command about the accident and await orders. The cable for the long-range transmitter antenna on the conning tower, however, is damaged, possibly due to the earlier surfacing maneuver in the Arctic.\n\nAn engineering team conceives a plan to rig a makeshift coolant system; because Polenin has discovered that the submarine was supplied with chemical, not nuclear, suits, teams are instructed to work in 10-minute shifts to limit radiation exposure. The first group emerges vomiting and heavily blistered; the second and third teams succeed in cooling the reactor, but all are severely ill with radiation poisoning. As radiation levels slowly rise inside the ship, the submarine surfaces and most of the crewmen are ordered topside. Radtchenko, the reactor officer, is initially assigned to go as part of the third team to finish the operation, but his fear upon witnessing the first team's radiation injuries overtakes him, and the crew chief joins the third team in his place.\n\nA United States Navy helicopter from a nearby destroyer approaches the \"K-19\"; the destroyer and asks if the \"K-19\" requires assistance. Vostrikov tells the destroyer \"no\" and refuses to allow the Americans anywhere near \"K-19\". Back in the Soviet Union, the government worries about the condition of the \"K-19\" because it has ceased contact with fleet command (due to its disabled long-range communicator) but has been spotted by Soviet spy aircraft in the vicinity of the American destroyer.\n\nWith the hope that fleet command will send some diesel submarines to tow the \"K-19\" back to port, Vostrikov ceases the mission and orders a heading that would return to port, but at a pace that could kill the entire crew with radiation sickness if rescue is not forthcoming. Shortly thereafter, the repair crews' pipework springs leaks and the reactor temperature begins to rise once again. This incites unrest among some of the crew, and in an accident, fuel that had been previously removed from a torpedo ignites, causing a fire in that compartment. Initially ordering the emergency fire suppression system to be activated (which would deprive the fire of oxygen, but suffocate anyone inside that area), Vostrikov is talked down by Polenin, who personally goes to assist the fire crew in putting out the fire. This leaves Vostrikov facing some hostile crew and officers who no longer have Polenin present to moderate them, and two officers enact a pre-planned mutiny to remove Vostrikov from command. Radtchenko, who earlier panicked and backed out from joining the repair crews, this time enters the reactor area alone and commences a second repair attempt.\n\nPolenin returns to the command deck after helping put out the torpedo room fire; upon seeing Vostrikov handcuffed to a ladder, he deceives the mutineers into handing over their weapons, places them under arrest, and then frees Vostrikov. Believing the repairs to have failed and unaware that Radtchenko had gone in alone to patch up the new leaks, Vostrikov, at the behest of Polenin, tells the crew what has happened, and his rationale for a subsequent dive to attempt another repair; he is afraid that if the reactor were to overheat, it could set off the actual nuclear warheads carried by the \"K-19\" and the accident would destroy not just the \"K-19\" but also the nearby American ship, provoking an American retaliatory attack and possibly inciting nuclear war. Vostrikov then waits for the crew to respond to his recommendation; the crew subsequently responds in the affirmative, and the \"K-19\" dives. Vostrikov then goes back to the reactor section after hailing Radtchenko and receiving no reply. Radtchenko's repairs were successful, but he received a heavier dose of radiation than earlier teams, having stayed in 18 minutes to complete his repair. Unable to see and too weak to properly extricate himself from the reactor chamber, Radtchenko is dragged out personally by Captain Vostrikov. The repairs prevent a reactor meltdown, but radiation is leaking throughout the submarine due to irradiated steam leakage from the reactor's damage.\n\nA Soviet diesel submarine finally reaches the \"K-19\"; it relays orders from fleet command to confine the crew on the submarine until a freighter can pick them up. Knowing it would be too dangerous to stay, Vostrikov orders the crew to be evacuated to the diesel submarine, despite knowing he will most likely lose his command and be sent to a gulag for countermanding a direct order. The crew is evacuated and returns to the Soviet Union, without having to receive assistance from the nearby Americans. After the incident, Captain Vostrikov is tried for endangering the mission and disobeying a direct order, but Polenin and the other officers and crew of the \"K-19\" come to his defense.\n\nEpilogue lead-in text indicates that charges against Captain Vostrikov were dropped, but that the former crew of the \"K-19\" is ordered to maintain silence regarding the incident, and Vostrikov is never given command of a submarine again. All seven men who went into the reactor chamber to effect repairs died of radiation poisoning days after returning home, and twenty other crew members later died from radiation sickness acquired during the incident. It is not until the fall of Communism nearly three decades later that the members of the \"K-19\" crew could openly discuss what happened.\n\nLater in 1989, an aged Captain Vostrikov meets Polenin on the anniversary of the day they were rescued. The commanders enter a cemetery where \"K-19\" survivors have met since the incident. Vostrikov is visibly moved as he greets the men and informs them that he nominated the crewmen who died from radiation poisoning—28 in total—for the Hero of the Soviet Union award, but was told the honor was reserved for combat veterans. Remarking that \"what good are honors from such people,\" referring to the committee that turned down his recommendation, Vostrikov toasts the survivors and the deceased crew who sacrificed their lives to honor their duty to their crewmates.\n\n\"The Widowmaker\" nickname was used only in the film. In real life, the submarine had no nickname until the nuclear accident on July 3, 1961, when she got her actual nickname \"Hiroshima\".\n\n\"K-19: The Widowmaker\" cost $100 million to produce, but gross returns were only $35 million in the United States and $30.5 million internationally. The film was not financed by a major studio (\"National Geographic\" was owned by National Geographic Partners, a joint venture with 21st Century Fox and The National Geographic Society), making it one of the most expensive independent films to-date. \"K-19: The Widowmaker\" was filmed in Canada, specifically Toronto, Ontario; Gimli, Manitoba; and Halifax, Nova Scotia.\n\nThe producers made some efforts to work with the original crew of \"K-19\", who took exception to the first version of the script available to them. The submarine's captain presented an open letter to the actors and production team, and a group of officers and crew members presented another. In a later script, several scenes were cut, and the names of the crew changed at the request of the crew members and their families.\n\nThe most significant difference between the plot and the historical events is the scene that replaces an incident where the captain threw almost all the submarine's small arms overboard out of concern about the possibility of a mutiny; the film instead portrays an actual attempt at mutiny.\n\nThe \"\"K-19\"\" was portrayed in the film by the \"Juliett\"-class \"K-77\", which was significantly modified for the role. Her Majesty's Canadian Submarine \"Ojibwa\" portrayed the Soviet \"S-270\". portrayed . The Canadian Halifax Shipyard stood in for the Sevmash shipyard of northern Russia.\n\nKlaus Badelt wrote the film's late-Romantic-styled score.\n\n\"K-19: The Widowmaker\" received mixed reviews with a total of 60% positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. It is summarized as being \"A gripping drama even though the filmmakers have taken liberties with the facts.\"\n\nWhen \"K-19: The Widowmaker\" was premiered in Russia in October 2002, fifty-two veterans of the \"K-19\" submarine accepted flights to the Saint Petersburg premiere; despite what they saw as technical as well as historical compromises, they praised the film and, in particular, the performance of Harrison Ford.\n\nIn his review, film critic Roger Ebert compared \"K-19: The Widowmaker\" to other classic films of the genre, \"Movies involving submarines have the logic of chess: The longer the game goes, the fewer the possible remaining moves. 'K-19: The Widowmaker' joins a tradition that includes \"Das Boot\" and \"The Hunt for Red October\" and goes all the way back to \"Run Silent, Run Deep\". The variables are always oxygen, water pressure and the enemy. Can the men breathe, will the sub implode, will depth charges destroy it?\"\n\n"}

Most of the hoard is now in the British Museum's collection, although a few items can be found in museums in Paris and Istanbul too.\n\nThe Lampsacus Treasure was accidentally found in 1847 by famers digging in a field near the village of Lapseki (ancient Lampsacus) in north-west Turkey. Dating to 6th and 7th centuries AD, the hoard of largely silver objects provides a significant catalogue of design and fashion from the early Byzantine period. Soon after its discovery, the bulk of the treasure came into the possession of Henry Richard Charles Wellesley, Earl of Cowley, who donated it to the British Museum in 1848. Two other institutions also have objects from the treasure: the Istanbul Archaeological Museum possess two bowls; the Louvre a further two spoons.\n\nThe hoard includes a wide range of ecclesiastical objects that may have originally belonged to a church or a wealthy individual connected with the church. It includes a silver tripod lamp-stand with five imperial control stamps that date from the reign of Justinian I (527-65AD). In the British Museum there are also twelve pear-shaped spoons, six of which bear inscriptions and verse in Greek and/or Latin, a (slightly damaged) silver chalice, two silver dishes with nielloed monograms in the centre, an ornate silver polycandelon, part of a folding stool, and various jewellery and furniture/vessel fittings.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20747733", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20747733", "title": "Language exchange", "text": "Language exchange\n\nLanguage exchange is a method of language learning based on mutual language practicing by learning partners who are speakers of different languages. This is usually done by two native speakers teaching each other their native language. Language exchange is different from other Language learning methods as there is usually no set syllabus or activities. Language exchange is sometimes called Tandem language learning.\n\nIn modern contexts, \"language exchange\" most often refers to the mutual teaching of partners' first languages. Language exchanges are generally considered helpful for developing language proficiency, especially in speaking fluency and listening comprehension. Language exchanges that take place through writing or text chats also improve reading comprehension and writing ability. The aim of language exchange is to develop and increase language knowledge and intercultural skills. This is usually done through social interaction with the native speaker. Given that language exchanges generally take place between native speakers of different languages, there is also the side benefit of improving cross-cultural communication.\n\nThis practice has long been used by individuals to exchange knowledge of foreign languages. For example, John Milton gave Roger Williams an opportunity to practice Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and French, while receiving lessons in Dutch in exchange. Language exchange first came about in the early 1800s where school aged children in England were introduced to the newly set up program. Countries such as Belgium and Switzerland found the language exchange program very easy to run as there were many languages spoken in the one country. French and German youth picked up language exchange in 1968 which then spread to Turkey and Madrid.\n\nUniversities are increasingly experimenting with language exchanges as part of the language learning curriculum. In this respect, language exchanges have a similar role as study abroad programs and language immersion programs in creating an environment where the language student must use the foreign language for genuine communication outside of a classroom setting. Language Travelling has increased significantly over the last three years, with an increase of 67%. However, there are also concerns that language exchanges cannot be used as a substitute for formal language education, given the difficulty of using language exchanges in learning formal grammar and writing skills.\n\nIn addition, various offline organizations exist to facilitate language exchanges, such as Tandem language learning and Unilang, as well as mobile apps like uTandem, Bilingua, Hello Pal and Tandem.\nBy using the mobile apps, users from all over the world can connect with new language partners to share connections and passions. \nSome of the apps will connect you based on interests, location or just with a native speaker of the language you are searching for.\n\nInstitutional programs\nIn Europe, the Erasmus programme (established in 1987 by the European Union and incorporated in the Socrates programme in 1994) allows students to do part of their studies in another European institution. The students will be studying for a minimum of three months, up to one year.\n\nIn Canada, the Katimavik programme is addressed to young volunteers aged 17 to 21; This program has cultural aims and allows them to practice the second official language in three Canadian provinces.\n\nIn Spain, the fields of education and training have increased language tourism by more than 20% between 2007 and 2009.\n\nLAOTSE (Links to Asia by Organizing Traineeship and Student Exchange) is an international network of technical universities from Europe to Asia.\n\nLanguage exchanges have been viewed as a helpful tool to aid language learning at language schools. Language exchanges tend to benefit oral proficiency, fluency, colloquial vocabulary acquisition, and vernacular usage. A major benefit of language exchange is the exposure to the native speaker's culture. Understanding the culture of native speaker will help with understanding why and how the language is used. Another benefit is that you are in an friendly and informal environment, this means there is no pressure to get everything right as both speakers are trying to learn and understand. This also gives the learning environment a fun and productive atmosphere. By learning with native speakers each person will get a better understanding of the language as they are learning from someone who has knowledge and background in the language, whereas, learning from someone who has learnt the language later on in their life may not be correct in what they are teaching.\nAnother benefit is that people are learning faster when they have a one-on-one connection with the \"teacher\". Many people choose to learn one-on-one but struggle try to find a teacher. People like this are highly motivated to learn a new language. The native speakers whom are helping these people may feel a new sense of motivation since they are now responsible for teaching this person. \n\nWith the growth of the internet, language exchanges using social networks and voice-over-IP technologies have become increasingly popular. Language learning social networks now offer students the ability to find language partners around the world, and speak, text chat or video through instant messengers. This has allowed students who previously could not find foreign language partners to search online for native speakers of that language.\nAnother perk of this technology is that users can verify their texts with native speakers. This way there will be less grammar mistakes and bigger improvements in languages. There are now over 24 different online language exchange groups that can be joined.\n\n"}

It runs for eleven days, incorporating over 100 events across Greater Manchester for families and adults. Siemens has been the Festival’s headline sponsor since 2014, as part of its Curiosity Project.\n\nThe festival launched at the Museum of Science and Industry in 2007. With over 100,000 visits to the festival in 2015, Manchester Science Festival is England's largest science festival. The Manchester Evening News describe the festival as “one of the most fun things to happen to the region in recent years, taking practical science into places you never imagined possible all over the city”.\n\nEach year, the programme features hands-on activities, immersive experiences, exhibitions, talks and tours. Events reflect the festival ethos of ‘part laboratory, part playground’, and aim to bring science to audiences at the Museum and at venues across Greater Manchester.\n\nThe programme for Manchester Science Festival is created and produced collaboratively with partners across the North West. Over the years, this has included University of Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan University, University of Salford, Chester Zoo, Cancer Research UK, HackManchester, Jodrell Bank Discovery Centre, Manchester Cathedral, John Rylands Library and Manchester Central Library.\n\nThe programme encourages audiences to actively participate in science. This includes science busking activities and since 2014 has included the Museum of Science and Industry’s Platform for Investigation (Pi). The Pi is sponsored by Siemens and is part of the museum’s monthly live event programme. Pi gives audiences the opportunity to meet scientists and hear about their research whilst getting involved with experiments and activities.\n\nExhibitions are a feature of the festival programme, including contemporary science exhibitions at the Museum of Science and Industry. Since 2014, Cape Farewell, UK have partnered with the festival to commission an exhibition inspired by James Lovelock’s Gaia Theory. Notable exhibitions include Marcus Coates’ \"The Sounds of Others\" and Tania Kovats’ \"Evaporation\".\n\nThe ninth annual science festival highlights included an adult only ball pool, artist Tania Kovats premiering \"Evaporation\", Brian Cox, Robin Ince and Jon Culshaw recording \"The Infinite Monkey Cage\", exhibition \"Kinetic Flux\" by Paul Miller and Griet Beyart and a two-day drone expo with the University of Salford’s Andy Miah. Manchester Evening News wrote that “The Manchester Science Festival – supported by Siemens – gives people the chance to get up close and hands-on with all things loud, lively, explosive and experimental”. The ball pool won Manchester Evening News’ City Life Awards Special Events Category 2015.\n\nFestival Director: Marieke Navin\n\nThe eighth Manchester Science Festival showcased Marcus Coates’ exhibition \"The Sounds of Others\", a 3D printing exhibition, a debate over the future of fracking with Bez from Happy Mondays, and the building of a Mega Menger. The website Creative Tourist wrote about Manchester Science Festival’s programme, saying that, “The delight in such a diversity of diversions is being able to wander according to one’s own fancy; being cartographer to your own map. The book of Manchester is open: choose your own adventure”.\n\nFestival Director: Marieke Navin\n\nIn its seventh year, Manchester Science Festival brought the exhibition \"Brains: the Mind as Matter\" and a supporting events programme, launched its second citizen science project, Hooked On Music and built a giant Rube Goldberg Machine. The Festival also won the Manchester Tourism Award for Large Tourism Event of the Year.\n\nFestival Director: Marieke Navin\n\nManchester Science Festival has been involved with two citizen science projects since 2007. The first was \"Turing’s Sunflowers\" in 2012 and #HookedOnMusic, part of the festival programme since 2013.\n\nThe experiment was conceived by Jonathan Swinton and led by Erinma Ochu at the Museum of Science and Industry, who said that “we hope to provide the missing evidence to test Turing's little-known theories about Fibonacci numbers in sunflowers. It would be a fitting celebration of the work of Alan Turing”.\n\nCitizen scientists from seven countries participated, growing over 500 sunflowers, over 450 of which conformed to the Fibonacci sequence, thereby proving Alan Turing’s theory.\n\nLaunched at the 2013 Manchester Science Festival with Ashley Burgoyne from the University of Amsterdam, audiences were encouraged to play a free, online game that produced results for scientific research. Researchers were looking for the hooks in music to help future research on Alzheimer’s disease. By using catchy music, researchers hope to find ways to trigger therapeutic benefits for patients.\n\nResults presented at the 2014 Manchester Science Festival revealed the UK’s top ten catchiest tunes, looking at just how memorable parts of songs can be. The number one catchiest song was the Spice Girls’ 'Wannabe'.\n\nSince 2014, Siemens has been the headline sponsor for the festival. Other major sponsors include the University of Salford, Electricity North West and the Waters Corporation.\n\n"}

Such music is generally composed by a process of centonization, either freely (i.e. improvised) or in a fixed pattern.\n\n\"Melody type\" as used by the ethmnomusicologist Mark is defined as a \"group of melodies that are related, in that they all contain similar modal procedures and characteristic rhythmic and melodic contours or patterns\".\n\nMost cultures which compose music in this way organize the patterns into distinct melody types. These are often compared to modern Western scales, but they in fact represent much more information than a sequence of permissible pitches, since they include how those pitches should function in the music, and indicate basic formulas which serve as a basis for improvisation. In non-improvised music, such as codified liturgical music, it is still usually clear how the melody developed from set patterns.\n\n\n\nIn most cases, these melody types are associated with extra-musical implications, particularly emotions (see Indian rasa, for instance). They are also often associated with certain times. For example, most ragas are associated with a certain time of day, or a wayang performance in Java implies a certain succession of pathets.\n\nMany of these traditions have a corresponding rhythmic framework. These include:\n\n"}

Metopes often had painted or sculptural decoration; the most famous example are the 92 metopes of the Parthenon marbles some of which depict the battle between the Centaurs and the Lapiths. The painting on most metopes has been lost, but sufficient traces remain to allow a close idea of their original appearance. \n\nIn terms of structure, metopes may be carved from a single block with a triglyph (or triglyphs), or they may be cut separately and slide into slots in the triglyph blocks as at the Temple of Aphaea. Sometimes the metopes and friezes were cut from different stone, so as to provide color contrast. Although they tend to be close to square in shape, some metopes are noticeably larger in height or in width. They may also vary in width within a single structure to allow for corner contraction, an adjustment of the column spacing and arrangement of the Doric frieze in a temple to make the design appear more harmonious.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1044528", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1044528", "title": "National Lampoon's Doon", "text": "National Lampoon's Doon\n\nNational Lampoon's Doon is a parody of Frank Herbert's 1965 science fiction novel \"Dune\", written by Ellis Weiner and published in 1984 by Pocket Books for \"National Lampoon\". It was reprinted by Grafton Books () in 1985. In 1988 William F. Touponce called the book \"something of a tribute to Herbert's success on college campuses\", noting that \"the only other book to have been so honored is Tolkien's \"Lord of the Rings\",\" which was parodied by \"The Harvard Lampoon\" in 1969.\n\n\"Dune\" is set on the dangerous, sandworm-ridden desert planet Arrakis, sole source of the spice melange, the most valuable substance in the universe. The parody follows a similar storyline, wherein rival restaurant-owning families battle for control of Arruckus, which is overrun by giant pretzels and the source of valuable beer.\n\nWithin the Galactic Empire, a change of fief is occurring. Led by the verbose Baron Vladimir, House Hardchargin, the Great Big House given charge of Arruckus, has been displaced by Shaddap IV, the Padedbrah Emperor, in favor of the up-and-coming House Agamemnides, with Duke Lotto at its head.\n\nArruckus is also known as \"Doon\", and is additionally known as the Dessert Planet. Covered entirely in sugars, it is a harsh unforgiving environment, where not an entree can be found; the natives live entirely on whatever they can import, produce from the sugars, or produce from soy protein (the native food experiments known as the \"Mahn t'Vani\")\n\nDuke Lotto accepts the fief, aware that it may well be a death trap but also conscious of the importance of Arruckus's only export, the wide-spectrum intoxicant known as beer. Found naturally on Arruckus as a result of natural processes and nowhere else, it is the engine on which commerce runs; the Schlepping Guild, who has a monopoly on space travel in the Imperium, will not run without it. Who controls the beer controls commerce.\n\nBut soon after arriving on Doon, with his heir and son Pall and his concubine the Lady Jazzica, an adept of the galaxy-spanning sisterhood of chefs and event planners known as the Boni Maroni, Duke Lotto and House Agamemnides fall victim to a scheme originated by Baron Vladimir Hardchargin and implemented by the Duke's own accountant Oyeah, who, without the Duke's knowledge, kept a secret second ledger. When the Emperor called for an audit of the fief, the duplicate ledger made it appear as though House Agamemnides had been cooking the books. In return for this act, Oyeah hoped the Baron would give him a start as a stand-up comic–which he did, but on the Imperial prison planet, Salacia Simplicissimus. Ruined, Duke Lotto's brief reign over Doon is ended and House Hardchargin is reinstated as fief-holders.\n\nBanished to the sugared wilderness, Pall (now head of House Agamemnides) and Lady Jazzica meet with and are eventually accepted by the planet's native population, the Freedmenmen, a process made easier by previous prophecy-seeding by the Missionaria Phonibalonica, via the Great Prophet Phyllis. The natives are receptive to the fulfillment of the prophecies even after the revelation that Phyllis's decanonization resulted in her prophecies being discredited. Pall, given the Freedmenmen name Assol and taking the secret name Mauve'Bib (after the purple napkin that all Freedmenmen wear about their necks), begins to ascend the power structure of the tribe and takes the Freedmenmen girl Loni as his lover. He realizes that he could use the Freedmenmen to return to a position of power, taking control of not only Doon but the Imperium itself. He also realizes what the planet's Imperial Planetologist and liberal economist, Keynes, had puzzled out some time before: the rampaging Giant Pretzels (known as Schmai-gunug) actually produces the beer as a byproduct of its very life-cycle. The Lady Jazzica ascends to the status of Revved-Up Mother of Hootch Grabr, becoming known as Jazzica-of-the-Weirdness. During her ascension, while getting drunk on the beer, she realizes that she carries Lotto's daughter. Her intoxication opens her foetal daughter to the thousands of years of Boni Maroni culinary history; the result is Nailya-the-Truly-Weird, a toddler who spouts recipes as though she were an adult.\n\nPall positions himself as the Kumquat Haagendasz (the result of a generations-long breeding program so secret that the Boni Maroni have actually forgotten the point) and the Mahdl-t, the long hoped-for Freedmenmen messiah, \"he who will drive us to Paradise and Back\", who will finally bring the entrees the Freedmenmen have hungered for. By this route, he assumes and consolidates his power over the natives, not only making them his allies, but his fanatic followers.\n\nMeanwhile, Baron Vladimir Hardchargin has his own problems. Converting the fief into the Shadvlad Rendezvous, the galaxy's premier lounge planet, is a relative success, even though the Freedmenmen remain a chronic problem and the Giant Pretzels remain at large. He is hungry for more success, and has plans to muscle out his silent partner (the Emperor) and play the Imperial House against the Boni Moroni, the Schlepping Guild, and the interstellar development cooperative NOAMCHOMSKI using his control of beer as leverage, thereby becoming the true power in the galaxy, and franchising the Shadvlad across the Imperium.\n\nEvents come to a head when Pall, gone completely native and acquiring the \"Eye of the Egad\" (the telltale red-on-red eyes, indicating severe beer addiction) challenges the Baron to a bake-off, with a new ingredient: peanut butter, rendered from the naturally occurring snack mix's peanuts, and debuting his secret weapon – a liqueur made from beer – Drambrewski. With the support of the Boni Moroni, the promise of an assured supply of beer to the Schlepping Guild (who had been influenced to believe that the Hardchargins have been watering the beer, and are revealed to have the red-on-red eyes of beer addiction), and after dispatching the ShaNaNa-Baron Flip-Rotha Hardchargin in rankout (single insult-combat), Pall assumes Imperial control, banishing the Emperor's house to the prison plant Simplicissima Secundus, acquiring the hand of the Emperor's daughter Serutan in a marriage of convenience, and the Freedmenmen woman Loni as his concubine.\n\nThe story uses a style typical to many parodies and spoofs of the genre, most notably \"Bored of the Rings\", encompassing not only high and sometimes abstruse humor but middle and low as well, through punning references and plays on words designed to either make light of the original characters' names or referencing pop-culture touchpoints.\n\nFor example, the galactic development combine CHOAM in the original \"Dune\" story becomes NOAMCHOMSKI, an acronym which expands to the name \"Neutralis Organizational Abba Mercantile Condominium Havatampa Orthonovum Minnehaha Shostakovich Kategorial Imperative\" – a name whose style mocks that of the equally-impenetrable \"Combine Honnete Ober Advancer Mercantiles\" – and is mentioned and expanded on by some characters to the point of compulsion. The Bene Gesserit litany against fear becomes the litany against fun: \"I must not have fun. Fun is the time-killer.\"\n\nAnother example is the repeated use of the name Jonzun Fillup, the acclaimed architect from whose designs the Baron Hardchargin cribs liberally to create the Shadvlad. This is a reference to Philip Johnson, the influential 20th Century American architect whose controversial postmodern design for the then-AT&T Building (latterly, the Sony Building in New York) included a top reminiscent of a Chippendale bookcase. This too is transferred to the story, as Baron Hardchargin lavishly praises Fillup's Gothic entablature at the north pole of the Antares Teleport and Telepath's headquarters planet.\n\nOther references, such as the word Mahn-t'vani (a play on the easy-listening music composer Mantovani) and the name Serutan (with reference to its famous \"Natures spelled backwards\" tagline) may seem a bit dated, but there are references to such things as the hokey-pokey and Tito Puente which still hold currency in modern culture.\n\nOverall, the arc of the story is respected and held closely to throughout. In the style of the original, quotes from the Princess Serutan's works (amongst them, \"The Portable Mauve'Bib\", \"In My Father's House, In His Room, And Especially Rummaging Through His Junk Drawer\", and \"No More Princess Nice Guy: The Princess Serutan Diaries\") lead off each chapter. \"Dune\" was a story about spice power; Doon is a story about beer power. Most notable is the successful transition of Herbert's style into comedy, as can be referenced by Pall Agamemnides as he surveys his situation prior to the relocation:\nThis realization focused within him in a sudden sparkflash computation, and in the clear brilliance of that illumination, the boy Pall understood a profoundness. His life, hitherto a child's plaything, devoid of direction–seemingly! Or had there in fact always been a plan–a plan within a plan within a plan (whatever that meant (whatever that meant (whatever that meant)))?–was now encompassed by a terrible purpose. He knew the meaning of the word terrible, and he knew the meaning of the word purpose. And therefore he understood deeply the meaning of \"terrible purpose\". Unless he, in the solitude of his deeply brain-filled mind, misunderstood this revelation, and was in fact confronted with a \"terrible papoose.\"\n\nWhat could that mean?\nThe native population of Doon, the Freedmenmen, are characterized as intense, somewhat overweight beer addicts, steeped in tradition, mysticism, and ritual, with a language of their own–\"Varietese\", a direct play on the signature style of headlinese of the entertainment-industry newspaper \"Variety\" (the magazine's famous headline, Sticks Nix Hick Pix, is rendered as an expression of resignation, along the lines of \"What can one do?\"). The stillsuit of the original story becomes the Freedmenmen sweatsuit, meant to induce sweating to reduce the accumulation of excess body weight brought on by constant beer consumption. The sandworms (also known as Maker and Shai-Hulud in the original) become giant pretzels, also known by the natives as Brewer and Schmai-gunug, a term the glossary claims is rendered from a Yiddish phrase meaning \"to browse and fiddle around and window-shop enough\".\n\nAn advertisement in the back of the book promised conceptual sequels, including \"Doon Meshugganah; Men, Women, Children, Pets of Doon; Lord God Help Us, Another Sequel to Doon; The Doon Reference Book, Atlas, and Rhyming Dictionary;\" and \"The Doon Catalogue of Quality Menswear for Dad 'n' Lad.\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

While the 3,000 mile buffer between it and Xerox headquarters in Rochester, New York afforded scientists at the new lab great freedom to undertake their work, the distance also served as an impediment in persuading management of the promise of some of their greatest achievements.\n\nPARC's West Coast location proved to be advantageous in the mid-1970s, when the lab was able to hire many employees of the nearby SRI Augmentation Research Center (ARC) as that facility's funding began falling, from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and U.S. Air Force (USAF). Being situated on Stanford Research Park land leased from Stanford Universityallowed Stanford graduate students to be involved in PARC research projects and PARC scientists to collaborate with academic seminars and projects.\n\nMuch of PARC's early success in the computer field was under the leadership of its Computer Science Laboratory manager Bob Taylor, who guided the lab as associate manager from 1970 to 1977 and as manager from 1977 to 1983.\n\nAfter three decades as a division of Xerox, PARC was transformed in 2002 into an independent, wholly owned subsidiary company dedicated to developing and maturing advances in science and business concepts with the support of commercial partners and clients.\n\nXerox remains the company's largest customer (50%), but PARC has many other corporate and venture clients in different fields of use than Xerox including: VMware, Fujitsu, Dai Nippon Printing (DNP), Samsung, NEC, SolFocus, Powerset, Thin Film Electronics ASA and many more.\n\nPARC currently conducts research into clean technology, metamaterials, user interface design, sensemaking, ubiquitous computing and context-aware systems, large-area electronics, digital manufacturing, and model-based control and optimization in embedded, intelligent systems.\n\nXerox PARC has been the inventor and incubator of many elements of modern computing in the contemporary office work place:\n\n\nMost of these developments were included in the Alto, which added the now familiar Stanford Research Institute (SRI) developed mouse, unifying into a single model most aspects of now-standard personal computer use. The integration of Ethernet prompted the development of the PARC Universal Packet architecture, much like today's Internet.\n\nXerox has been heavily criticized (particularly by business historians) for failing to properly commercialize and profitably exploit PARC's innovations. A favorite example is the graphical user interface (GUI), initially developed at PARC for the Alto and then commercialized as the Xerox Star by the Xerox Systems Development Department. Although very significant in terms of its influence on future system design, it is deemed a failure because it only sold approximately 25,000 units. A small group from PARC led by David Liddle and Charles Irby formed Metaphor Computer Systems. They extended the Star desktop concept into an animated graphic and communicating office-automation model and sold the company to IBM.\n\nAmong PARC's distinguished researchers were three Turing Award winners: Butler W. Lampson (1992), Alan Kay (2003), and Charles P. Thacker (2009). The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Software System Award recognized the Alto system in 1984, Smalltalk in 1987, InterLisp in 1992, and the remote procedure call in 1994. Lampson, Kay, Bob Taylor, and Charles P. Thacker received the National Academy of Engineering's prestigious Charles Stark Draper Prize in 2004 for their work on the Alto.\n\nPARC's developments in information technology served for a long time as standards for much of the computing industry. Many advances were not equalled or surpassed for two decades, enormous timespans in the fast-paced high-tech world.\n\nWhile there is some truth that Xerox management failed to see the potential of many of PARC's inventions, this was mostly a problem with its computing research, a relatively small part of PARC's operations. A number of GUI engineers left to join Apple Computer. Technologies pioneered by its materials scientists such as liquid-crystal display (LCD), optical disc innovations, and laser printing were actively and successfully introduced by Xerox to the business and consumer markets.\n\nWork at PARC since the early 1980s includes advances in ubiquitous computing, aspect-oriented programming, and IPv6.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7949664", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7949664", "title": "Participatory media", "text": "Participatory media\n\nParticipatory media is media where the audience can play an active role in the process of collecting, reporting, analyzing and disseminating content. Citizen / Participatory journalism, citizen media and democratic media are related principles.\n\nParticipatory media includes community media, blogs, wikis, RSS, tagging and social bookmarking, music-photo-video sharing, mashups, podcasts, participatory video projects and videoblogs. All together they can be described as \"e-services, which involve end-users as active participants in the value creation process\". However, \"active [...] uses of media are not exclusive to our times\". \"In the history of mediated communication we can find many variations of participatory practices. For instance, the initial phase of the radio knew many examples of non-professional broadcasters\".\n\nMarshall MacLuhan discussed the participatory potential of media already in the 1970s but in the era of digital and social media, the theory of participatory culture becomes even more acute as the borders between audiences and media producers are blurring.\n\nThese distinctly different media share three common, interrelated characteristics:\n\n\nFull-fledged participatory news sites include NowPublic, OhmyNews, DigitalJournal.com, On the Ground News Reports and GroundReport.\n\nWith participatory media, the boundaries between audiences and creators become blurred and often invisible. In the words of David Sifry, the founder of Technorati, a search engine for blogs, one-to-many \"lectures\" (i.e., from media companies to their audiences) are transformed into \"conversations\" among \"the people formerly known as the audience\". This changes the tone of public discussions. The mainstream media, says David Weinberger, a blogger, author and fellow at Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet & Society, \"don't get how subversive it is to take institutions and turn them into conversations\". That is because institutions are closed, assume a hierarchy and have trouble admitting fallibility, he says, whereas conversations are open-ended, assume equality and eagerly concede fallibility.\n\nSome proposed that journalism can be more \"participatory\" because the World Wide Web has evolved from \"read-only\" to \"read-write\". In other words, in the past only a small proportion of people had the means (in terms of time, money, and skills) to create content that could reach large audiences. Now the gap between the resources and skills needed to consume online content versus the means necessary to produce it have narrowed significantly to the point that nearly anyone with a web-connected device can create media. As Dan Gillmor, founder of the Center for Citizen Media declared in his 2004 book We the Media, journalism is evolving from a lecture into a conversation. He also points out that new interactive forms of media have blurred the distinction between producers of news and their audience. In fact, some view the term \"audience\" to be obsolete in the new world of interactive participatory media. New York University professor and blogger Jay Rosen refers to them as \"the people formerly known as the audience.\" In \"We Media\", a treatise on participatory journalism, Shayne Bowman and Chris Willis suggest that the \"audience\" should be renamed \"participants\". One of the first projects encompassing participatory media prior to the advent of social media was The September 11 Photo Project. The exhibit was a not-for-profit community based photo project in response to the September 11 attacks and their aftermath. It provided a venue for the display of photographs accompanied by captions by anyone who wished to participate. The Project aimed to preserve a record of the spontaneous outdoor shrines that were being swept away by rain or wind or collected by the city for historical preservation.\n\nSome even proposed that \"all mass media should be abandoned\", extending upon one of the four main arguments given by Jerry Mander in his case against television: Corporate domination of television used to mould humans for a commercial environment, and all mass media involve centralized power. Blogger Robin Good wrote, \"With participatory media instead of mass media, governments and corporations would be far less able to control information and maintain their legitimacy... To bring about true participatory media (and society), it is also necessary to bring about participatory alternatives to present economic and political structures... In order for withdrawal from using the mass media to become more popular, participatory media must become more attractive: cheaper, more accessible, more fun, more relevant. In such an atmosphere, nonviolent action campaigns against the mass media and in support of participatory media become more feasible.\"\n\nAlthough 'participatory media' has been viewed uncritically by many writers, others, such as Daniel Palmer, have argued that media participation must also \"be understood in relation to defining characteristics of contemporary capitalism – namely its user-focused, customised and individuated orientation.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "33154613", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33154613", "title": "Persecution of Hazara people", "text": "Persecution of Hazara people\n\nThe persecution of Hazara people refers to the discrimination of the Hazaras, who are primarily from the central highland region of Hazarajat in Afghanistan. Significant populations of the Hazara people are also found in Quetta, Pakistan and Mashad, Iran as part of the Hazara and Afghan diasporas. The persecution of Hazara people dates back to the 16th century, with Babur from Kabulistan. It is reported that during the reign of Emir Abdur Rahman (1880–1901), thousands of Hazaras were killed, expelled and enslaved. Syed Askar Mousavi, a contemporary Hazara writer, claims that half the population of Hazarajat was displaced, shipped to neighbouring Balochistan in British India and Khorasan Province in Iran. This led to Pashtuns and other groups occupying parts of Hazarajat. The Hazara people have also been the victims of massacres committed by the Taliban and al-Qaeda. , conditions have not improved for the Hazaras in Afghanistan and thousands continue to be persecuted in neighboring Pakistan by Sunni extremist groups.\n\nHazaras are historically the most restrained ethnic minority group in the state and have witnessed slight improvements in the circumstances even with the setup of modern Afghanistan. The discrimination against this ethnic group has continued for centuries, instigated by Pashtuns and other ethnic groups. Syed Askar Mousavi, a contemporary Hazara writer, estimates that more than half of the entire population of Hazarajat was driven out of their villages, including many who were massacred. \"It is difficult to verify such an estimate, but the memory of the conquest of the Hazārajāt by ʿAbd-al-Raḥmān Khan certainly remains vivid among the Hazāras themselves, and has heavily influenced their relations with the Afghan state throughout the 20th century.\" \nThe British from neighboring British India, who were heavily involved in Afghanistan, did not document such a large figure. Others claim that Hazaras began leaving their hometown of Hazarajat due to poverty and in search of employment mostly in the 20th century. Most of these Hazaras immigrated to neighbouring Balochistan, where they were provided permanent settlement by the government of British India. Others settled in and around Mashad, in the Khorasan Province of Iran.\n\nThe Hazaras of Afghanistan faced severe political, social and economic tyranny and denial of basic civil rights. In the late 19th century, the Hazaras along with their Shia counterpart Qizilbash sided with the invading British-led Indians against the Sunni Ethnic groups of Afghanistan. In 1933, Abdul Khaliq Hazara, a Hazara student assassinated Afghan King Nadir Khan.\n\nNotably, after the Second Anglo-Afghan War, Shah Abdur conducted a campaign of repression in Hazarajat, but it was met with fierce opposition by Hazara tribal leaders. The first uprising was conducted in correlation with Shah Adbur's cousin, Mohammad Eshaq who sought to overthrow the Shah. This revolt of Hazara nationalists and anti-Shah partisans was brief, because Shah Adbur astutely used sectarian strife to divide the Hazara Shias and the Sunni partisans, thus allowing him to easily defeat his foes.\n\nThe defeat of the Hazaras in their first revolt allowed Shah Adbur to impose taxes on Hazarajat for the first time, and they severely impeded the autonomy of Hazarajat, because numerous Pashtun soldiers and government officials were garrisoned in Hazarajat in order to ensure its compliance with the Pashtun-run state. Subsequently, the Pashtuns garrisoned in Hazarajat, treated the local Hazaras inferiorly and often committed arbitrary acts of cruelty and brutality against them. This caused great unrest and a deepening hatred between the Hazaras and their Pashtun rulers, causing the Hazaras to reach their tipping point in 1892. When a local Pashtun garrison searched the home of a Hazara chieftain for arms, but the pretext was false, the garrison subsequently tied the chieftain up and made him watch while they raped his wife.\n\nThe outrage that followed allowed the Hazaras to unite once again in order to overthrow most of the local Pashtun garrisons in Hazarajat. This newfound zealous fever fermented fierce resistance against Shah Adbur and his forces. Witnessing the rising tide, Shah Adbur felt he had no choice but to wage a jihad against the Shia Hazaras, and under this casus belli Shah Adbur was able to muster around 150,000 troops. The resulting conflict was brutal and led to a great loss of life on both sides. The Hazaras fought with vigour but the attrition they faced due to lack of rations, led to their demise at the uprising's epicenter of Oruzgan. The aftermath of the uprising was a genocide at the hands of Shah Adbur, who wiped out more than half of the entire Hazara population, and caused a myriad of people to be driven out of their villages. Prior to the genocide, Hazaras made up more than half of Afghanistan's total population. Although once the largest ethnicity, they were now a minority, constituting roughly 9% of Afghanistan's total population. Accordingly, in order to stifle Hazara influence Shah Adbur fragmented Hazarajat and demarcated it so that it would encompass numerous other provinces, where the Hazara are now a minority.\n\nIn February 1993, a two-day military operation was conducted by the Islamic State of Afghanistan government and the Saudi-backed Sunni Wahhabi Ittihad-i Islami militia led by Abdul Rasul Sayyaf. At that time Ittihad-i Islami was allied with the government of Burhanuddin Rabbani. The military operation was conducted in order to seize control of the Afshar district in west Kabul where the Shia Hezb-e Wahdat militia (which was allied to Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Sunni Hezb-i Islami and backed by Pakistan) was based and from where it was shelling civilian areas in northern Kabul. The operation also intended to capture Wahdat leader Abdul Ali Mazari. The Afshar district, situated on the slopes of Mount Afshar west of Kabul, is a densely populated district. The area is predominantly inhabited by Shia Hazara people. The Afshar military operation escalated into what became known as the Afshar massacre when the Saudi backed Wahhabi militia of Ittihad-e-Islami went on a rampage through Afshar, killing, raping, looting and burning houses. Two out of nine Islamic State sub-commanders, Anwar Dangar (later joined the Taliban) and Mullah Izzat, were also reported as leading troops that carried out abuses. The Islamic State government in collaboration with the then enemy militia of Hezb-e Wahdat as well as in cooperation with Afshar civilians established a commission to investigate the crimes that had taken place in Afshar. The commission found that around 70 people died during the street fighting and between 700 and 750 people were abducted and never returned by Abdul Rasul Sayyaf's men. These abducted victims were most likely killed or died in captivity. Dozens of women were abducted during the operation as well.\n\nFollowing the 1997 massacre of 3,000 Taliban prisoners by Abdul Malik Pahlawan in Mazar-i-Sharif thousands of Hazara men and boys were massacred by other Taliban members in the same city in August 1998. Human rights organizations reported that the dead were lying on the streets for weeks before the Taliban allowed their burial due to stench and fear of epidemics.\n\nThe pass connecting the settlements of Tashkurgan and Pule Khumri is known as Robatak Pass. A mass murder was carried out there by Taliban in May 2000 in which 31 people were reported dead. Twenty-six of the victims were Ismaili Hazara from Baghalan province. Their remains were found to the northeast of the pass, in a neighborhood known as Hazara Mazari, on the border between Baghlan and Samngan provinces. The victims were detained four months before their execution by Taliban troops between January 5 and January 14, 2000.\n\nIn January 2001 the Taliban committed a mass execution of Hazara people in Yakawlang District of Bamyan province, Afghanistan. This started on January 8 and lasted for four days; it took the lives of 170 men. Taliban apprehended about 300 people, including employees of local humanitarian organizations. They were grouped to various assemblage points where they were shot dead in public view. Around 73 women, children and elderly were taking shelter in a local mosque when Taliban fired rockets at the mosque.\n\nIn June 2010, at least nine Hazara men were killed in an ambush in Khas Urozgan District. The Taliban took responsibility for the attack.\n\nIn November 2015, Afghan militants claiming loyalty to the Islamic State beheaded seven ethnic Hazara civilians who had been abducted in the southern Afghan province of Zabul. Their throats were cut with metal wire. The victims were four men, two women, and a 9-year-old girl.\n\nOn July 23, 2016 two Islamic State suicide bombers blow themselves during the peaceful protest 'Junbish Roshnaye' in Kabul killing 160 and wounded over 200 people. The attackers were reportedly from the local affiliate of the so-called Islamic State, known as the \"Khurasan Province\" (IS-Khurasan).\n\n18 people were killed and 54 were injured in July 2016 at Kabul's landmark Sakhi Shrine by a gunman wearing an Afghan National Security Forces uniform. The attack took place on the eve of Ashura, the Shia mourning day. Responsibility for the attack was claimed by the Islamic State, or ISIS.\nThe next morning, an improvised electronic device(IED) killed at least 15 Hazara people in the Balkh province of northern Afghanistan. ISIS claimed responsibility for this attack as well. These attacks show the growing threat of the IS to the Hazara people.\n\nThere has been a significant improvement in the status and treatment of Hazaras in Afghanistan. The new Afghan constitution now recognizes them as one of the country's ethnic minorities, and they now have the full right to Afghan citizenship. In Afghanistan's recent parliamentary election, Hazaras won around 25 per cent of the seats. Hazara have also pursued higher education, enrolled in the army, and many have top government positions. For example, Mohammad Mohaqiq, a Hazara from the Hizb-i-Wahdat party, ran in the 2004 presidential election in Afghanistan, and Karim Khalili became the Vice President of Afghanistan. Since ousting the Taliban in late 2001, billions of dollars have been poured into Afghanistan for several large-scale reconstruction projects that took place from August 2012. For example, there have been more than 5000 kilometers of road pavement completed across Afghanistan, of which little was done in central Afghanistan Hazarajat. On the other hand, the Band-e Amir in the Bamyan Province became the first national park of Afghanistan. The road from Kabul to Bamyan was also built, along with new police stations, government institutions, hospitals, and schools in the Bamyan Province, Daykundi Province, and others. The first ski resort of Afghanistan was also established in the Bamyan Province.\n\nThere is still a large degree of discrimination against Hazaras, however. A new danger in the form of ISIS has become especially prominent in recent years, and they have carried out abductions, extortions and violent killings against Hazaras. The rising power of warlords, who the Hazara people perceive as a direct threat, has also been a matter of concern. There have been ethnic tensions and violent clashes with nomadic Kuchis over land access issues. Taliban fighters continue to abduct and execute Hazaras travelling in vehicles. Furthermore, anti-Hazara sentiments became stronger when the former director of the National Directorate of Security, Amrullah Saleh, accused Iran of interfering in Afghan affairs through Shias. Hazara activists still believe that the government does not serve their people's security needs sufficiently. Parts of central Afghanistan, like the unofficial Hazara capital Bamiyan, are among the country's poorest and often lack even basic necessities like water and electricity. Hazara people held a protest in March 2016 against the government's decision to move a proposed power line project out of Bamiyan, seeing it as another form of ethnic discrimination.\n\nThe history of Hazara people in Pakistan dates back to the 1840s, when Hazara tribesmen from Hazarajat began migration to colonial India because of persecution by Pashtuns and Tajiks. Many Hazaras were enlisted in the British Indian Army during the first Anglo-Afghan War (1838-1840). The mass-migration and permanent settlements started in the 1890s when Emir Abdul Rahman Khan started persecuting the Hazaras of Afghanistan. The majority of Hazara are Shi'a Muslims with a sizable Sunni minority. Pakistan is home to an estimated 20% Shia Muslim population. Sectarian violence in Pakistan started in 1980s.\n\nIn 2011 the persecution of Hazaras in Quetta has left at least 1300 dead and more than 1500 wounded. The victims include high-profile community members, laborers, women and children. One third of the victims are children. The major attacks included assassinations of Hussain Ali Yousafi, Olympia Abrar Hussain, bombing of a Hazara mosque, Ashura massacre, Quds Day bombing, Play ground massacre, Mastung massacre, January 2013 Quetta bombings, February 2013 Quetta bombing, Hazara Pilgrims carnage, Akhtarabad massacre & other terrorist attacks on Hazara People in Quetta.\n\nThe Al-Qaeda affiliated Pakistani Sunni Muslim extremist militant group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, has claimed responsibility for most of these attacks.\n\nIn response to these killings, worldwide demonstrations were held to condemn the persecution of Hazaras in Quetta. The Hazara diaspora all over the world, namely in Australia, Western Europe, North America as well as the Hazara in Afghanistan, have protested against these killings and against the silence of international community. Haji Mohammad Mohaqiq, the political leader of the Hazara in Afghanistan, has also expressed solidarity with the Hazara community in Quetta. The persecutions have been documented by the United Nations, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Asian Human Rights Commission, Human Rights Commission of Pakistan and Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission. EU parliamentarian Rita Borsellino has urged the international community to address the plight of Hazara people in Quetta. The members of British Parliament, Alistair Burt, Mark Lancaster, Alan Johnson, and Iain Stewart asked the government to pressure Pakistani authorities concerning the absence of justice for Hazara community in Pakistan\n\nAs a consequence of the attacks there has been a recent exodus of Hazaras trying to flee the violence. They are headed mainly to Australia & other Western Countries, where thousands of them have taken shelter and successfully relocated after obtaining refugee status. To get there, they complete an illegal and treacherous journey across Southeast Asia through air, land and sea that has already left hundreds of them dead.\n\nThe most recent attack occurred on October 10, 2017, when two unidentified attackers on a motorcycle opened fire on a van heading for a nearby vegetable market, killing the driver and four others, continuing the trend of attacks against Hazaras in Quetta. This series of bombings, attacks and assassinations have forced them to retreat to two heavily protected enclaves on either side of the city: Marriabad and Hazara Town.\n\nSo far Hundreds of Hazara individuals have been killed in Karachi, but none of the killers has never been brought to Justice. Among the dead were social workers & intellectuals.\nIn Karachi terrorists shot dead Agha Abbas, owner of famous fruit juice outlet \"Agha Juice\". Sindh police announced the arrest of Akram Lahori, chief of a banned religious group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (lej) along with his four accomplices, for their alleged involvement in sectarian killings, including the murder of Agha Abbas.\n\nIn response, many members and leaders of Lashkar-e Jhangvi (LeJ) have been killed in military operations conducted by the army and the police.\n\nThe main character in Khaled Hosseini's novel \"The Kite Runner\" is Amir, a Pashtun boy who has a Hazara friend, Hassan, in 1970s Afghanistan. They are bullied by an older Pashtun who expresses scorn for the Hazara people and rapes Hassan.\n\nIn the book \"In The Sea There Are Crocodiles\", Eniatollah Akbari, a Hazara boy, details his journey to escape persecution in Afghanistan.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46185063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46185063", "title": "Shadowrun", "text": "Shadowrun\n\nShadowrun is a science fantasy tabletop role-playing game set in a near-future fictional universe in which cybernetics, magic and fantasy creatures co-exist. It combines genres of cyberpunk, urban fantasy and crime, with occasional elements of conspiracy, horror and detective fiction. From its inception in 1989, \"Shadowrun\" has remained among the most popular role-playing games. It has spawned a vast franchise that includes a series of novels, a collectible card game, two miniature-based tabletop wargames, and multiple video games.\n\nThe title is taken from the game's main premise – that industrial espionage runs rampant in a near-future setting. A \"shadowrun\" – a successful data theft or physical break-in at a rival corporation or organization – is one of the main tools employed by both corporate rivals and underworld figures. Deckers (futuristic hackers) who can tap into an immersive, three-dimensional cyberspace are opposed by rival deckers and lethal, potentially brain-destroying artificial intelligences called \"Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics\" – \"ICE\" for short –, who are protected by street fighters and/or mercenaries, often with cyborg implants (called \"cyberware\"), magicians, and other exotic figures, on such missions as they seek access, physical or remote, to the power structures of rival groups. Magic has also returned to the world after a series of dystopian plagues; dragons who can take human form have returned as well, and are commonly found in high positions of corporate power.\n\n\"Shadowrun\" takes place several decades in the future (2050 in the first edition, currently 2080). The end of the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar ushered in the \"Sixth World\", with once-mythological beings (e.g. dragons) appearing and forms of magic suddenly emerging. Large numbers of humans have \"Goblinized\" into orks and trolls, while many human children are born as elves, dwarves, and even more exotic creatures. In North America, indigenous peoples discovered that their traditional ceremonies allow them to command powerful spirits, and rituals associated with a new Ghost Dance movement let them take control of much of the western U.S. and Canada, where they formed a federation of Native American Nations. Seattle remains under U.S. control by treaty as a city-state enclave, and most game materials are set there and assume campaigns will use it as their setting.\n\nIn parallel with these magical developments, the setting's 21st century features technological and social developments associated with cyberpunk science fiction.\nMegacorporations control the lives of their employees and command their own armies; the ten largest have extraterritoriality, such as currently enjoyed by foreign heads of state. Technological advances make cyberware (mechanical replacement body parts) and bioware (augmented vat-grown body parts implanted in place of natural organs) common. The Computer Crash of 2029 led to the creation of the Matrix, a worldwide computer network that users interact with via direct neural interface. When conflicts arise, corporations, governments, organized crime syndicates, and even wealthy individuals subcontract their dirty work to specialists, who then perform \"shadowruns\" or missions undertaken by deniable assets without identities or those that wish to remain unknown. The most skilled of these specialists, called shadowrunners, have earned a reputation for getting the job done. They have developed a knack for staying alive, and prospering, in the world of \"Shadowrun\".\n\n\"Shadowrun\" was developed and published by FASA from 1989 until early 2001, when FASA closed its doors and the property was transferred to WizKids (a company founded by former FASA employees). WizKids licensed the RPG rights to Fantasy Productions (who were already publishing for the German version) until they were acquired by Topps in 2003. Catalyst Game Labs (a publishing imprint of InMediaRes Productions) licensed the rights from Topps to publish new products. WizKids itself produced an unsuccessful collectible action figure game based on the property, called \"Shadowrun Duels\".\n\n\"Shadowrun\" Fifth Edition was announced in December 2012. It was released as a PDF in July 2013, with a limited-edition softcover version of the Fifth Edition core rulebook sold at the Origins Game Fair in June 2013. The hardcover version was released in August 2013. It is generally similar to the system that was unveiled in Fourth Edition and modified in the Twentieth Anniversary Edition.\n\nSince 2004, \"Shadowrun Missions\" (\"SRM\") has offered fans \"living campaigns\" that allow for persistent character advancement. \"SRM\" is broken down into \"seasons\" which are made up of up to 24 individual missions that can be played at home, with special missions available to play exclusively at conventions. Each \"SRM\" season develops an overarching plot focused on a specific city from the \"Shadowrun\" setting. Missions settings have included the divided city of Denver, the corporate city-state of Manhattan, and the Seattle Metroplex city-state, and the formerly walled-off wastelands of Chicago.\n\nThe \"Shadowrun\" role-playing game has spawned several properties, including \"\", eight video games, an action figure game (\"Shadowrun Duels\"), two magazines, an art book and more than 50 novels, starting with the \"Secrets of Power\" series which introduces some of the original characters of \"Shadowrun\" and provides an introduction to this fictional universe. In addition to the main rule book (now in its fifth edition) there have been over 100 supplemental books published with adventures and expansions to both the rules and the game settings. Catalyst Game Labs announced that 2013 would be \"The Year of Shadowrun,\" and in addition to the release of Shadowrun Fifth Edition that it has collaborated with publishers on the following properties: \"Shadowrun: Crossfire, The Adventure Deck-building Game\"; \"Shadowrun: Sprawl Gangers\", a tactical miniatures wargame; and \"Shadowrun: Hostile Takeover\", a board game designed by Bryan C.P. Steele is planned for release in late 2014/early 2015. In addition, Catalyst has been in collaboration with Nordic Games and Cliffhanger Studios to create \"\" online RPG, as well as teasing the release of future novels and other \"Shadowrun\" fiction.\n\nThe \"Shadowrun\" world is cross-genre, incorporating elements of both cyberpunk and urban fantasy. Unlike in a purely cyberpunk game, in the \"Shadowrun\" world, magic exists and has \"worked\" since 2011. Among other things, this split humankind into subtypes, also known as metatypes/metahumans. Some of these metatypes take the form of common fantasy races. Likewise, some animals have turned into familiar monsters of past fantasy and lore and both monsters and human magicians have regained magical powers. By the second half of the 21st century, in the time the game is set, these events are accepted as commonplace. Man, machine, and magic exist in a world where the amazing is among the most common and technology has entered into every facet of human (and metahuman) life.\n\nCharacters in \"Shadowrun\" can be humans, orks, trolls, elves, dwarves, as well as certain diverging subspecies (known as metavariants) such as gnomes, giants, minotaurs, etc. In the early days, when magic returned to the world, humans began to either change into, or give birth to elf and dwarf infants, a phenomenon called Unexplained Genetic Expression (UGE). Later, some juvenile and adult humans \"goblinized\" into other races (mostly orks, but also some trolls). The term \"metahuman\" is used either to refer to humanity as a whole, including all races, or to refer specifically to non-human races, depending on context. With the return of Halley's Comet new human variants called \"changelings\" arose. Two of the metahuman races have fictional languages.\n\nAdditionally, a virus known as the Human Meta-Human Vampiric Virus (HMHVV), with many variant strains, has been known to cause further change, far beyond that of traditional vampirism, frequently resulting in fierce abominations that are no longer human and sometimes no longer even sentient: bandersnatches, banshees, dzoo-noo-quas, goblins, ghouls, nosferatus, vampires, wendigos, wild fomorians, and others. Most of these species do not consider human/metahuman types as more than victims, and are generally treated as dangerous subjects by society. They are not normally available as player characters. Dragons are also present in the awakened world, though not as player characters. Dragons are very powerful physically, magically, and in some situations, financially; some dragons found the riches they hoarded and hid during the last Awakening. Their great intelligence allowed them to gain a great deal of influence and power quickly and a few have risen to high political and economical posts, running entire corporations or even as heads of state.\n\nThe game is set 62 years in the future, following a great change that has returned magic to the world. The emergence of magic, the outbreak of the VITAS plagues, the Computer Crash of 2029, the Euro-Wars, and the fevers for independence of Amerindian tribes, Chinese provinces, and everything else that came with the many struggles that ravaged Europe and Asia left the world's governments tumbling and falling. The United States was broken into substates. Monetary value was lost. The world had to rebuild, and rebuild they did, this time in the image of the megacorporations that seized power. Taking advantage of the laws that had been passed years ago, and using their newfound freedom, the megacorps began impressing their power on the failing governments. Before long the world was transformed. Boundaries were redrawn, and the political landscape was changed forever.\n\nA basic premise of the setting is that as the world endured the string of state-changing events and conflicts, the political landscape fragmented and reformed. In North America, for example, some nations broke apart and reformed, as was the case with the Confederation of American States and the United Canadian and American States, while others became havens for specific racial or ethnic groups, like Native American Nations (the Native Americans having used their newfound magical abilities to regain massive tracts of land) or the Elvish principality of Tír Tairngire, which encompasses all of the state of Oregon. Some, like the California Free State, simply declared independence, while yet others became \"de facto\" corporate subsidiaries like Aztlan (the former Mexico), the headquarters of the Aztechnology megacorp. Despite the new role of megacorporations, many nations still hold considerable sway through economic, social and military means. For most people, “getting by” means taking advantage of whatever the corps or the government might bring their way.\n\nThe monolithic \"enemies\" of the \"Shadowrun\" world (borrowing heavily from cyberpunk mythos) are the corporations, dubbed \"megacorporations\", \"megacorps\", or simply \"megas\" or \"corps\" for short. Megacorporations in the 21st-century are global, with all but the smallest corps owning multiple subsidiaries and divisions around the world. They are the superpowers of the \"Shadowrun\" universe, with the largest corporations having far more political, economic, and military power than even the most powerful nation-states.\n\nIn \"Shadowrun\", corporations are effectively \"ranked\" by the amount of assets under their control, including material, personnel, and property, as well as profit. These ranks are A, AA, and AAA; AAA corporations are top tier. Most corporations in the AA and AAA level are immune to domestic law, responsible only to themselves, and regulated only by the Corporate Court, an assembly of the ten AAA-rated corporations. All AAA-rated and most AA-rated corporations exhibit a privilege known as \"extraterritoriality\", meaning that any land owned by the corp is sovereign territory only to the corp and immune to any laws of the country within. Corporate territory is not foreign soil but corporate soil, just like its employees are corporate citizens, though dual citizenship in a corporation and a nation is common. The AAA corps, as well as numerous minor corporations, fight each other not only in the boardroom or during high-level business negotiations but also with physical destruction, clandestine operations, hostile extraction or elimination of vital personnel, and other means of sabotage. Because no corporation wants to be held liable for damages, it has to be done by deniable assets, or shadowrunners, invisible to the system where every citizen is tagged with a System Identification Number (SIN).\n\nDespite the Crash which caused much data corruption, technology in the game is advanced. Cyberware (technical implants) and Bioware (genetically engineered implants which enhance a person's abilities) emerged. Characters can also augment their bodies with nanotechnology implants.\n\nIn earlier editions, direct neural interface technology enabled humans and metahumans to directly access computers and the Matrix, the ingame global computer network restructured after the 2029 Crash. Access to the Matrix was accomplished by \"deckers\": individuals that have \"cyberdecks\". These interface machines are connected to the brain through a brain–computer interface called a \"datajack\" that is generally located at the temple or behind the ear.\n\nIn \"Shadowrun, Fourth Edition\", the Matrix rules have changed, thanks to the setting's constant evolution and a drive to match real world technological developments. After the second Matrix crash in 2064, Matrix technology was moved away from the wired network and led into a wireless technology. The most noticeable difference between the Matrix in the 2070s and the earlier editions is that wireless technology has become completely ubiquitous. Communications and Matrix access is provided through Wi-Fi nodes placed throughout the infrastructure of just about every city on Earth, fulfilling a service similar to contemporary cell sites—but as these nodes are as numerous as telephone poles, only a tiny percentage of their range is necessary. The nodes of all electronic devices a person carries are connected in a similar manner, creating a Personal Area Network (PAN). People access their PAN with their Commlink, a combination personal computer/cell phone/PDA/wireless device available either as a brain implant or a head-mounted display. This access can be the total sensory immersion common to cyberpunk fiction, or a sensory enhancement by which the virtual features of one's physical surroundings can be perceived and manipulated. The Matrix of the 2070s is thus not only a virtual reality, but an augmented or mixed reality. Cyberdecks are obsolete, so \"deckers\" have once again become \"hackers\". In turn, the otaku of previous versions (deckers who did not need decks to access the Matrix) have been reworked into technomancers, who possess an innate connection to the Matrix that permits them to access the wireless network without hardware.\n\nIn \"Shadowrun Fifth Edition\", corporations have cracked down on hacking, reforming the matrix into Grids for better control and creating the Grid Overwatch Division (GOD). Hackers were thus forced to acquire specialized, larger variants of commlinks, which were swiftly named cyberdecks after the devices of old. This has resulted in the return of the term \"decker\" of earlier editions.\n\nIn the sixth world, riggers are people who use datajacks and in most cases a special type of cyberware - called the \"control rig\" - to interface with vehicles and drones. Often they also use a remote control deck called the \"rigger command console\". The term \"rigger\" may also be applied to others using these machines.\n\nRiggers jump in to machines to control them with their mind. While jumped in they feel like they are the machine, using the vehicle or drone's sensors to replace their own. This allows the rigger to control the machine at Matrix speeds and with greater precision. The downside is if the machine takes damage the rigger will have to deal with dangerous levels of biofeedback. Likewise the rigger may have to engage in cybercombat with other hackers that are attempting to hijack their devices.\n\nThose able to actively interact with the magical energies of the Sixth World are known as \"awakened\". An awakened character's power in magic is linked to their Magic attribute. A magic user's approach to working with mystic energy is called their Path. The Awakened fall into three general Paths: magicians, adepts and mystic adepts. Broadly speaking, magicians focus their magic outward, actively affecting the world around them, while adepts focus their magic inward, passively enhancing their bodies and minds.\n\nMagicians are able to cast spells, summon spirits, and create magical artifacts called \"foci\". All magicians follow traditions that determine their understanding of magic, including hermetic mages (whose control of magic comes through study and manipulation of magical energy or mana, and who summon and bind elementals in lengthy and expensive rituals to be called on later) and shamans (whose magic derives from a connection to nature via a totem spirit, and who can summon the nature spirits associated with a particular place). Adepts use magic internally in order to accentuate their natural physical abilities. Adepts can run on walls, use mundane objects as deadly thrown projectiles, shatter hard objects with a single unarmed blow, and perform similar feats of incredible ability. All adepts follow a very personal path (Path of the Warrior, Path of the Artist, etc.) that normally determines their abilities which might be very different for any two adepts (while one might demonstrate increased reflexes and facility with firearms, a second might possess unparalleled mastery of the katana, and a third might be able to pull off incredible vehicular stunts). Mystic adepts, also known as physical mages, are part magician and part adept who distribute their magic power between the abilities of both aspects.\n\nThe \"Shadowrun\" game mechanics are based entirely on a 6-sided dice system. The game is skill-based rather than class-based, but archetypes are presented in the main book to give players and gamemasters an idea of what is possible with the system.\n\nBefore the fourth edition, skill and ability checks worked as follows: all actions in the game, from the use of skills to making attacks in combat, are first given a target number that reflects the difficulty of the action which is then raised or lowered by various modifying factors, such as environmental conditions, the condition of the character, the use of mechanical aids, and so forth. The player then rolls a number of dice equal to their level in the relevant skill, and the number of dice rolled that meet or exceed the target number determines if the character is successful performing the action and the degree of success the character has. As an example, a character with a high firearms skill not only has a better chance at hitting a target than someone with a lower ranked skill, but also is more likely to cause more damage to the target. Target numbers may exceed 6, in which case any dice that show a 6 have to be re-rolled (a target number of, e.g., 9 is reached by rolling a 6 followed by at least a 3; thus, a target number of 6 and one of 7 are identical, except extra dice rolls are not allowed for target number 7 or greater). For even higher target numbers, this procedure has to be repeated; thus, an action with a target number of 20 (like attempting to procure military-grade weaponry) will only succeed if three successive dice rolls result in sixes, and the fourth gives at least a 2. For any dice-roll a roll of 1 always counts as a failure. This system allows great flexibility in setting the difficulty of an action.\n\nIn addition to this basic mechanic, players can use several task-specific dice pools to add bonus dice to certain tests, though dice that are used do not refresh until the end of a turn. This adds an extra tactical element, as the player must decide where best to spend these bonus dice. For example, combat pool dice could be spent to improve attacks or to improve defense, or some of each. Players also have Karma Pool that can be used to reroll any dice that failed to reach the target number. Karma Pool refreshes rarely, typically once per scene or less, at the GM's discretion. The combination of Karma Pool and dice pools gives players a considerable amount of freedom to decide how important a task is to their character. Two characters with identical statistics could perform very differently on the same tasks depending on their priorities (and thus, allocation of dice pools and Karma Pool).\n\nIn the fourth edition, things have changed substantially. The game still runs on six-sided dice, but now each task is given a threshold. The player then rolls dice equal to their skill plus the relevant attribute modified by applicable modifiers. The number of fives and sixes is equal to the number of hits. Hits above the threshold indicate extraordinary performance. Furthermore, if more than half the dice rolled are ones, then the player has made a glitch. Glitches cause bad things to happen to the player and game masters are encouraged to be inventive and funny.\n\nAlthough the skill system is freeform, certain combinations of skills and equipment work well together. This combination of specialization in skill and equipment is known as an archetype. The most notable archetypes are street samurai, characters who have heavily augmented their bodies with cyberware and bioware and focus on physical combat; adepts, characters who have magical abilities that increase their physical (and sometimes mental) combat abilities; faces, highly charismatic characters who specialize in negotiations and social manipulation; hackers (deckers), experts in electronic surveillance, security, and augmented/virtual reality monitoring, combat and response; riggers, who augment their brains to achieve fine control over vehicles and drones; and magicians, who cast spells and can view emotions and call spirits from astral space. In \"Fourth Edition\", with the setting change, deckers are replaced by hackers, who manipulate computer networks with augmented reality via ubiquitous commlinks; they also tend to take over the rigger's role.\n\nHowever, the archetypes are not character classes: the player is allowed to cross boundaries. Restrictions are not imposed by the system itself, but by the player's specializations. Because character-building resources are limited, the player has to weigh which game resource he wants to specialize in and which he has to neglect. This allows high character customization while still ensuring that characters are viable in the setting.\n\nThe fourth edition of \"Shadowrun\" uses a point-based character creation system. Earlier editions and later in the fifth edition, used a priority-based system with point-based character creation as an advanced option. Priorities are divided into race, magic, attributes, skills, and resources. All things that do not explicitly fall under the first four classifications, including contacts in third and earlier editions of \"Shadowrun\", are given cash-equivalent values to be bought with resources.\n\n\"Shadowrun\" characters are created with contacts, friends and acquaintances who serve as key nodes in the character's social network and who will often help the character out. Through the contacts system, players may uncover information that their characters cannot independently acquire. Additionally, players can often negotiate for the use of skills that their characters do not themselves have, a radical departure from most role-playing games.\n\nEssence is a measure of a living being's lifeforce. All humans and metahumans start with a value of six (although critters may start with a higher or lower Essence). It powers magic, and as essence fades, so does magical aptitude. Cyberware, bioware, nanotech implants, extreme cases of substance addiction, and other major changes to a being's body can damage its essence as well. Generally, if a being's essence ever reaches zero, it dies. Cybermancy allows metahumans to survive with an essence rating of zero or less.\n\nPlayers are awarded Karma points as a game progresses. In third edition and earlier, these points are usually added to a total called Good Karma, which can be used to boost attributes and skills. Skills that are already well-developed cost more Good Karma than skills which are undeveloped, which helps encourage specialized characters to become more flexible by spending Good Karma on weaker attributes. Karma also makes characters more powerful in general because every tenth (or twentieth for metahumans) point is added to the Karma Pool instead of Good Karma. The Karma Pool allows players to re-roll dice or \"purchase\" additional dice in certain situations. Karma can even be used to avoid certain death, at the cost of all Good Karma and Karma Pool points. In fourth edition, Karma Pool is replaced by a new attribute called Edge which can be used in most of the same ways as the third edition Karma Pool. Experience and character advancement is still tracked with Karma, although Good was dropped from the name as it no longer needs to be distinguished from the old Karma Pool.\n\n\"Shadowrun\" is linked to \"Earthdawn\", and is set in the \"Sixth World\", where \"Earthdawn\" is the \"Fourth World\" and modern-day Earth is at the tail end of the \"Fifth World\". Such links are not necessary for play, but they allow crossover potential. The concept of the \"Worlds\" is linked to the ancient Aztec belief that the world is renewed every five thousand years—a period called a \"Sun\" (currently we live in the fifth Sun). The date of the beginning of the \"Sixth World\" is based on the ancient Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, which when \"Shadowrun\" was developed was correlated as finishing a 5,200-year-long cycle on 24 December 2011. The understanding of the Maya that resulted in the use of the 2011 date and the use of the \"worlds\" concept is due to the influence of Frank Waters's 1975 book \"Mexico Mystique: The Coming Sixth World of Consciousness\", whose elaborate cosmology is selectively utilized in the framework of the \"Shadowrun\" universe. Waters took his information about the date of the end of the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar from the 1966 edition of Michael D. Coe's \"The Maya\".\n\n\"Shadowrun\" is also influenced by the writings of William Gibson (particularly \"Neuromancer\"). Gibson, who gave no permission and expressed strong aversion for mixing his ideas with \"spare me, *elves*,\" reacted as follows to its release:\nIn 2007, Robert Boyd from Carrickfergus, Northern Ireland, robbed a Belfast lingerie shop at knifepoint while wearing a blonde lady's wig. During his trial, Boyd stated he was playing \"Shadowrun\", specifically the role of criminal elf Buho, at the time and may have \"blurred reality and fantasy\". This claim convinced only two members of the jury and Boyd was jailed for two years.\n\nFASA released 40 \"Shadowrun\" novels in collaboration with Roc publishing between 1991 and 2001. \"Shadowrun\" novels went out of production between 2001 and 2005, making the books produced towards the end of FASA's ownership of the license hard to find. Another (41st) novel was announced, but never released.\n\nIn 2005, WizKids began publishing new \"Shadowrun\" novels, again through the Roc imprint of the New American Library. Six novels were released in the new series. In 2008, Catalyst Game Labs announced the return of novels for \"Classic BattleTech\", \"MechWarrior\" and \"Shadowrun\". The announcement states that the first of the all-new \"Shadowrun\" novels would appear tentatively by early 2009, but the novels were not released due to unexplained delays in production of the novels for all three franchises. A collection of short stories titled \"Spells and Chrome\" was published in 2010. In 2012, Catalyst Game Labs published a standalone electronic novella, \"Neat\", written by Russell Zimmerman. Catalyst later announced plans to release further fiction and eventually novels to be released in collaboration with Barnes & Noble in Winter 2013.\n\nSeveral additional novels were published in other languages. More than 30 novels have been written in German, by German and Austrian authors published by Heyne (since 1991) and FanPro (since 1997).\n\nEight video games have been developed based on the \"Shadowrun\" franchise; the first in 1993 was an action role-playing game titled \"Shadowrun\" and developed by Beam Software for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The second, also titled \"Shadowrun\", was released for the Sega Genesis in 1994, developed by BlueSky Software. The third game was an interactive fiction adventure game developed by Japanese company Group SNE in 1995 for the Sega CD, again titled \"Shadowrun\". A fourth game, titled \"Shadowrun: Assassin\", was planned to be released in 1998 by FASA Interactive Technologies for the PC, but was cancelled. The next game released was a first-person shooter for the Xbox 360 and Windows Vista, entitled \"Shadowrun\". It was developed by FASA Interactive, owned by Microsoft, which also produced the title. It was the very first game that allows cross-platform play on the Games for Windows – Live service. As the publishers of the \"Shadowrun\" role-playing game stated at the time of the video game's release: \"Microsoft rewrote the timeline and setting for this game, so it is not in continuity with the tabletop RPG. It may be more accurately described as a game loosely based on \"Shadowrun\".\"\n\nIn September 2007, Microsoft closed FASA Studios and licensed the \"Shadowrun\" electronic entertainment rights to Smith & Tinker, a company owned by Jordan Weisman, one of the original creators of \"Shadowrun\". In 2012, Weisman's company Harebrained Schemes launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the development of \"Shadowrun Returns\", a 3D turn-based single player role-playing video game. Approximately 1.8 million US dollars were pledged, four times more than the $400,000 goal. \"Shadowrun Returns\" was released on July 25, 2013. An expansion for \"Shadowrun Returns\" named \"\" was created as a stretch goal, and then later re-released as a standalone game called \"Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut\". In January 2015, Harebrained Schemes launched another Kickstarter to fund , which was released August 2015. Jan Wagner's Cliffhanger Productions also ran a successful Kickstarter campaign for an online 3D turn-based strategy role-playing video game that can be played either alone or with other players. On 14 August 2012, the campaign was funded at $558,863. The game was due to be released at the end of 2013 as \"Shadowrun Online\", but was actually released in April 2015 as \"\".\n\nChronology of \"Shadowrun\" video games:\n\n\"Shadowrun\" was ranked 8th in the 1996 reader poll of \"Arcane\" magazine to determine the 50 most popular roleplaying games of all time. The UK magazine's editor Paul Pettengale commented: \"\"Shadowrun\"'s strength lies in the cleverly designed background, which creates a unique setting that actually works and is continually evolving. It also ties in with FASA's other main system, \"Earthdawn\" - while \"Shadowrun\" is the future, \"Earthdawn\" is the past of the same world. Between the two a fascinating universe has been created, offering a great deal of potential for all styles of play.\"\n\nSteven S. Long comments: \"\"Shadowrun\" second edition belongs on the list of best hobby games because it so superbly integrates the gaming-specific material with the setting information. In doing so it satisfies what many gamers see as their twin needs: hard-and-fast rules that make gameplay fun; and an immersive setting that enhances the gaming experience, rather than detracting from it.\"\n\nThe \"Shadowrun\" role-playing game, various expansions, the short story anthology \"Spells & Chrome\", and a have won Origins Awards. The 4th edition also won the ENnie Awards for Best Rules as well as for Best Product in 2006. In 2010, \"Shadowrun – 20th Anniversary Edition\" won three silver ENnies: Best Interior Art, Best Production Values and Best Game.\n\n"}

The poem chronicles a rural New England family as a snowstorm rages outside for three days. Stuck in their home for a week, the family members exchange stories by their roaring fire.\n\nWhittier began the poem originally as a personal gift to his niece Elizabeth as a method of remembering the family. Nevertheless, he told publisher James Thomas Fields about it, referring to it as \"a homely picture of old New England homes\". The poem was written in Whittier's home in Amesbury, Massachusetts, though it is set at his ancestral home in Haverhill. \"Snow-Bound\" was first published as a book-length poem on February 17, 1866.\n\n\"Snow-Bound\" was financially successful, much to Whittier's surprise. By the summer after its first publication, sales had reached 20,000, earning Whittier royalties of ten cents per copy. He ultimately collected $10,000 for it. Its popularity also led to the home depicted in the poem being preserved as a museum in 1892.\n\nThe first important critical response to \"Snow-Bound\" came from James Russell Lowell. Published in the \"North American Review\", the review emphasized the poem as a record of a vanishing era. \"It describes scenes and manners which the rapid changes of our national habits will soon have made as remote from us as if they were foreign or ancient,\" he wrote. \"Already are the railroads displacing the companionable cheer of crackling walnut with the dogged self-complacency and sullen virtue of anthracite.\" The poem was second in popularity only to Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's \"The Song of Hiawatha\" and was published well into the twentieth century. Though it remains in many common anthologies today, it is not as widely read as it once was.\n\nThe poem attempts to make the ideal past retrievable. By the time it was published, homes like the Whittier family homestead were examples of the fading rural past of the United States. The use of storytelling by the fireplace was a metaphor against modernity in a post-Civil War United States, without acknowledging any of the specific forces modernizing the country. The raging snowstorm also suggests impending death, which is combated against through the family's nostalgic memories. Scholar Angela Sorby suggests the poem focuses on whiteness and its definition, ultimately signaling a vision of a biracial America after the Civil War. \n\n"}
{"id": "1187874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1187874", "title": "Speech balloon", "text": "Speech balloon\n\nSpeech balloons (also speech bubbles, dialogue balloons or word balloons) are a graphic convention used most commonly in comic books, comics and cartoons to allow words (and much less often, pictures) to be understood as representing the speech or thoughts of a given character in the comic. There is often a formal distinction between the balloon that indicates thoughts and the one that indicates words spoken aloud: the balloon that conveys thoughts is often referred to as a thought bubble.\n\nOne of the earliest antecedents to the modern speech bubble were the \"speech scrolls\", wispy lines that connected first person speech to the mouths of the speakers in Mesoamerican art between 600 and 900 AD.\n\nIn Western graphic art, labels that reveal what a pictured figure is saying have appeared since at least the 13th century. These were in common European use by the early 16th century. Word balloons (also known as \"banderoles\") began appearing in 18th-century printed broadsides, and political cartoons from the American Revolution (including some published by Benjamin Franklin) often used them. They later fell out of fashion, but by 1904 had regained their popularity, although they were still considered novel enough to require explanation. With the development of the comics industry in the 20th century, the appearance of speech balloons has become increasingly standardized, though the formal conventions that have evolved in different cultures (USA as opposed to Japan, for example), can be quite distinct.\n\nRichard F. Outcault's Yellow Kid is generally credited as the first American comic strip character. His words initially appeared on his yellow shirt, but word balloons very much like those in use today were added almost immediately, as early as 1896. By the start of the 20th century, word balloons were ubiquitous, and since that time only a very few American comic strips and comic books have relied on captions, notably Hal Foster's \"Prince Valiant\" and the early \"Tarzan\" comic strip in the 1930s. In Europe, where text comics were more common, speech balloons slowly caught on with well known examples like Alain Saint-Ogan's \"Zig et Puce\" (1925), Hergé's \"The Adventures of Tintin\" (1929) and Rob-Vel's \"Spirou\" (1938).\n\nThe most common is the speech bubble. It comes in two forms for two circumstances: an in-panel character and an off-panel character. An in-panel character (one who is fully or mostly visible in the panel of the strip of comic that the reader is viewing) uses a bubble with a pointer, called a tail, directed towards the speaker.\n\nWhen one character has multiple balloons within a panel, often only the balloon nearest to the speaker's head has a tail, and the others are connected to it in sequence by narrow bands. This style is often used in Mad Magazine, due to its \"call-and-response\" dialogue-based humor.\n\nAn off-panel character (the comic book equivalent of being \"off screen\") has several options, some of them rather unconventional. The first is a standard speech bubble with a tail pointing toward the speaker's position. The second option, which originated in manga, has the tail pointing \"into\" the bubble, instead of out. (This tail is still pointing towards the speaker.) The third option replaces the tail with a sort of bottleneck that connects with the side of the panel. It can be seen in the works of Marjane Satrapi (author of \"Persepolis\").\n\nIn American comics, a bubble without a tail means that the speaker is not merely outside the reader's field of view but invisible to the viewpoint character, often as an unspecified member of a crowd.\n\nCharacters distant (in space or time) from the scene of the panel can still speak, in squared bubbles without a tail; this usage, equivalent to voice-over in film, is not uncommon in American comics for dramatic contrast. In contrast to captions, the corners of such balloons never coincide with those of the panel; for further distinction they often have a double outline, a different background color, or quotation marks.\n\nThought bubbles come in two forms: the chain thought bubble and the \"fuzzy\" bubble.\n\nThe chain thought bubble is the almost universal symbol for thinking in cartoons. It consists of a large, cloud-like bubble containing the text of the thought, with a chain of increasingly smaller circular bubbles leading to the character. Some artists use an elliptical bubble instead of a cloud-shaped one.\n\nOften animal characters like Snoopy and Garfield \"talk\" using thought bubbles. Thought bubbles may also be used in circumstances when a character is gagged or otherwise unable to speak.\n\nAnother, less conventional thought bubble has emerged: the \"fuzzy\" thought bubble. Used in manga (by such artists as Ken Akamatsu), the fuzzy bubble is roughly circular in shape (generally), but the edge of the bubble is not a line but a collection of spikes close to each other, creating the impression of fuzziness. Fuzzy thought bubbles do not use tails, and are placed near the character who is thinking. This has the advantage of reflecting the TV equivalent effect: something said with an echo.\n\nWriters and artists can refuse to use thought bubbles, expressing the action through spoken dialogue and drawing; they are sometimes seen as an inefficient method of expressing thought because they are attached directly to the head of the thinker, unlike methods such as caption boxes, which can be used both as an expression of thought and narration while existing in an entirely different panel from the character thinking. However, they are restricted to the current viewpoint character. An example is Alan Moore and David Lloyd's \"V for Vendetta\", wherein during one chapter, a monologue expressed in captions serves not only to express the thoughts of a character but also the mood, status and actions of three others.\n\nThe shape of a speech balloon can be used to convey further information. Common ones include the following:\n\nCaptions are generally used for narration purposes, such as showing location and time, or conveying editorial commentary. They are generally rectangular and positioned near the edge of the panel. Often they are also colored to indicate the difference between themselves and the word balloons used by the characters, which are almost always white. Increasingly in modern comics, captions are frequently used to convey an internal monologue or typical speech.\n\nSome characters and strips use highly unconventional methods of communication. Perhaps the most notable is the Yellow Kid, an early American comic strip. His (but not the other characters') words would appear on his large, smock-like shirt. A short-run American animated TV series of the early 1980s used this same concept, but with changing phrases on the \"T-shirts\" worn by the animal-based characters, depending on the characters' thoughts. \n\nAlso noteworthy are the many variations on the form created by Dave Sim for his comic \"Cerebus the Aardvark\". Depending on the shape, size, and position of the bubble, as well as the texture and shape of the letters within it, Sim could convey large amounts of information about the speaker. This included separate bubbles for different states of mind (drunkenness, etc.), for echoes, and a special class of bubbles for one single floating apparition.\n\nAn early pioneer in experimenting with many different types of speech balloons and lettering for different types of speech was Walt Kelly, in his \"Pogo\" strip. Deacon Mushrat speaks in blackletter, P.T. Bridgeport speaks in circus posters, Sarcophagus MacAbre speaks in condolence cards, \"Mr. Pig\" (a take on Nikita Khrushchev) speaks in faux Cyrillic, etc.\n\nIn the famous French comic series \"Asterix\", Goscinny and Uderzo use bubbles without tails to indicate a distant or unseen speaker. They have also experimented with using different types of lettering for characters of different nationalities to indicate they speak a different language that Asterix may not understand; Goths speak in blackletter, Greeks in angular lettering (though always understood by the Gaulish main characters, so it is more of an accent than a language), Norse with \"Nørdic åccents\", Egyptians in faux hieroglyphs (depictive illustrations and rebuses), etc. Another experiment with speech bubbles was exclusive to one book, \"Asterix and the Roman Agent\". The agent in question is a vile manipulator who creates discord in a group of people with a single innocent-sounding comment. His victims start quarreling and ultimately fighting each other while speaking in green-colored speech bubbles.\n\nFont variation is a common tactic in comics. \"The Sandman\" series, written by Neil Gaiman and lettered by Todd Klein, features many characters whose speech bubbles are written with a font that is exclusive to them. For examples, the main character, the gloomy Dream, speaks in wavy-edged bubbles, completely black, with similarly wavy white lettering. His sister, the scatterbrained and whimsical Delirium speaks in bubbles in a many-colored explosive background with uneven lettering, and the irreverent raven Matthew speaks in a shaky angular kind of bubble with scratchy lettering. Other characters, such as John Dee, have special shapes of bubbles for their own.\n\nIn \"Mad\"'s recurring \"Monroe\" comic strip, certain words are written larger or in unusual fonts for emphasis.\n\nIn manga, there is a tendency to include the speech necessary for the storyline in balloons, while small scribbles outside the balloons add side comments, often used for irony or to show that they're said in a much smaller voice. Satsuki Yotsuba in the manga series Negima is notable because she speaks almost \"entirely\" in side scribble.\n\nSpeech bubbles are used not only to include a character's words, but also emotions, voice inflections and unspecified language.\n\nOne of the universal emblems of the art of comics is the use of a single punctuation mark to depict a character's emotions, much more efficiently than any possible sentence. A speech bubble with a single big question mark (?) (often drawn by hand, not counted as part of the lettering) denotes confusion or ignorance. An exclamation mark (!) indicates surprise or terror. This device is broadly used in the European comic tradition, the Belgian artist Hergé's \"The Adventures of Tintin\" series being a good example. Sometimes, the punctuation marks stand alone above the character's head, with no bubble needed.\n\nIn manga, the ellipsis (i.e. three dots) is also used to express silence in a much more significant way than the mere absence of bubbles. This is specially seen when a character is supposed to say something, to indicate a stunned silence or when a sarcastic comment is expected by the reader. The ellipsis, along with the big drop of sweat on the character's temple—usually depicting shame, confusion, or embarrassment caused by other people's actions—is one of the Japanese graphic symbols that have taken root in comics all around the world, although they are still rare in Western tradition. Japanese even has a sound effect for \"deafening silence\", .\n\nIn many comic books, words that would be foreign to the narration but are displayed in translation for the reader are surrounded by angle brackets or chevrons .\n\nGilbert Hernandez's series about Palomar is written in English, but supposed to take place mainly in a Hispanic country. Thus, what's supposed to be representations of Spanish speech is written without brackets, but occasional actual English speech is written within brackets, to indicate that it is unintelligible to the main Hispanophone characters in the series.\n\nSome comics will have the actual foreign language in the speech balloon, with the translation as a footnote; this is done with Latin aphorisms in \"Asterix\".\n\nAnother convention is to put the foreign speech in a distinctive lettering style; for example, \"Asterix\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Goths speak in blackletter.\n\nSince the Japanese language uses two writing directionalities (vertical, which is the traditional direction; and horizontal, as most other languages), manga has a convention of representing translated foreign speech as horizontal text.\n\nIt is a convention in American comics that the sound of a snore is represented as a series of Z's, dating back at least to Rudolph Dirks' early 20th-century strip \"The Katzenjammer Kids\". This practice has even been reduced to a single letter Z, so that a speech bubble with this letter standing all alone (again, drawn by hand rather than a font type) means the character is sleeping in most humorous comics. This can be seen, for instance, in Charles Schulz's \"Peanuts\" comic strips.\n\nOriginally, the resemblance between the 'z' sound and that of a snore seemed exclusive to the English language, but the spread of American comics has made it a frequent feature in other countries. An exception to this is in Japanese manga, where the usual symbol for sleep is a large bubble coming out of the character's nose.\n\nSinging characters usually have musical notes drawn into their word balloons. Archie Comics' Melody Valentine, a character in their \"Josie and the Pussycats\" comic, has musical notes drawn into her word balloons at all times, to convey that she speaks in a sing-song voice.\n\nThe above-mentioned Albert Uderzo in the \"Asterix\" series decorates speech bubbles with beautiful flowers depicting an extremely soft, sweet voice (usually preceding a violent outburst by the same character).\n\nA stormy cloud with a rough lightning sticking out of it, either in a bubble or just floating above the character's head as a modified 'cloudy' thought bubble, depicts anger, not always verbally expressed.\n\nLight bulbs are sometimes used when the character comes up with an idea or solution to a problem.\n\nIn the Western world, it is common to replace profanity with a string of nonsense symbols (&%$@*$#), sometimes called grawlixes. In comics that are usually addressed to children or teenagers, bad language is censored by replacing it with more or less elaborate drawings and expressionistic symbols. For example, instead of calling someone a swine, a pig is drawn in the speech bubble.\n\nOne example is the Spanish \"Mortadelo\" series, created by Francisco Ibáñez. Although not specifically addressed to children, \"Mortadelo\" was born during Francisco Franco's dictatorship, when censorship was the order of the day and the slightest attempt of rough language was prohibited. When Ibáñez's characters are angry, donkey heads, lightning, lavatories, billy goats and even faux Japanese characters are often seen in their bubbles.\n\nWhen \"Mortadelo\" was portrayed on film by Spanish director Javier Fesser in 2003, one of the critiques made to his otherwise successful adaptation was the character's use of words that never appeared in the comics. Fesser claimed: \"When you see a bubble speech containing a lightning falling on a pig, what do you imagine the character's saying?\"\n\nIn order for comic strip and graphic novel dialogue to make sense, it has to be read in order. Thus, conventions have evolved in the order in which the communication bubbles are read. The individual bubbles are read in the order of the language. For example, in English, the bubbles are read from left to right in a panel, while in Japanese, it is the other way around. Sometimes the bubbles are \"stacked\", with two characters having multiple bubbles, one above the other. Such stacks are read from the top down. Poor use of speech balloons can unintentionally make the proper reading order ambiguous, confusing the reader.\n\nTraditionally, a cartoonist or occupational letterer would draw in all the individual letters in the balloons and sound effects by hand. A modern alternative, used by most comics today and universal in English-translated manga, is to letter with computer programs. The fonts used usually emulate the style of hand-lettering.\n\nTraditionally, most mainstream comic books are lettered entirely in upper-case, with a few exceptions:\n\nWhen hand-lettering, upper-case lettering saves time and effort because it requires drawing only three guidelines, while mixed-case lettering requires five.\n\nIn a few comics, uppercase and lowercase are used as in ordinary writing. Since the mid-1980s, mixed case lettering has gradually become more widely used in mainstream books. Some comics, such as \"Pearls Before Swine\", also use lowercase speech to mark a distinctive accent (in this case, the male crocodiles’ accented speech, opposed to all other characters who use standard uppercase speech).\n\nFrom 2002–2004, Marvel Comics experimented with mixed-case lettering in all its books. Most mainstream titles have since returned to traditional all upper-case lettering.\n\nIn many comics, although the lettering is entirely in capital letters, serif versions of \"I\" are used exclusively where a capital I would appear in normal print text, and a sanserif (i.e., a simple vertical line) is used in all other places. This reduces confusion with the number one, and also serves to indicate when the personal pronoun \"I\" is meant. This lettering convention can be seen in computer fonts such as Blambot's \"DigitalStrip.ttf\" and \"AnimeAce.ttf\" fonts, which make no other distinction between lower- and uppercase letters.\n\nIn several occasions, comics artists have used balloons (or similar narrative devices) as if they have true substance, usually for humorous meta-like purposes. In \"Peanuts\", for example, the notes played by Schroeder occasionally take substance and are used in various ways, including Christmas decorations or perches for birds. Sometimes balloons can be influenced by the strip's environment: in the Italian strip \"Sturmtruppen\" they freeze and crack when the temperature is very low, or an Archie comic strip where two men from Alaska remarked on how cold it was, by saying the speech balloons froze as they said them, and the words had to be thawed out to be heard.\n\nIn the Flemish \"Suske en Wiske\" series, on one occasion a thought bubble full of mathematical formulas is cut open with scissors and its contents emptied in a bag, to be saved for later (in a manner not unlike the pensieve in the Harry Potter series). In the same series, speech balloons are occasionally even held and blown up to function as actual balloons or the words of the speech bubble are occasionally shown coming out the side of the speech bubble, to signify that the speaker is moving so fast that their words can't keep up with them, i.e. at supersonic speed.\n\nIn the novel \"Who Censored Roger Rabbit?\", the last words of a murdered Toon (cartoon character) are found under his body in the form of a speech balloon.\n\nMany digital artists generate speech balloons with general-purpose illustration software. Products like Comic Book Creator for Microsoft Windows, Comic Life for Mac OS X and Windows target the non-professional end of the market.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11130358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11130358", "title": "Taua", "text": "Taua\n\nA taua is a war party in the tradition of the Maori, the indigenous people of New Zealand. Contemporary knowledge of taua is gleaned from missionary observations and writings during the Musket Wars of the early 19th century and the later New Zealand wars. The reason to engage gather a taua may be for reasons of seeking revenge (utu) or seeking compensation for an offence against an individual, community or society (muru).\n\nA taua was typically composed of males, although there were occasions when women fought as well. The party was led by a chief (rangatira), and would be made up of around 70 warriors. This number was the general capacity of a “waka taua” (a war canoe), however sometimes waka would be designed to carry up to 140 warriors, and such canoes were called \"Te Hokwhitu a Tu\". During the height of the musket wars the number of warriors rose to about 2,000 and the group travelled mainly on foot around the North Island coast.\n\nThe most comprehensive written account of a war expedition was written by missionary Henry Williams. This heke was a consequence of the so-called Girls’ War, which was a fight that occurred on the beach at Kororareka, Bay of Islands in March 1830 between northern and southern hapū within the Ngāpuhi iwi. Hengi, a chief of Whangaroa, was shot and killed while he attempted to stop the fighting. The duty of seeking revenge had passed to Mango and Kakaha, the sons of Hengi; they took the view that the death of their father should be acknowledged through a muru (war expedition to honour the death of an important chief), against tribes to the south.\n\nMango, Kakaha and Tītore (a war leader of the Ngāpuhi) did not commence the muru until January 1832. The warrriors were successful in fights on the Mercury Islands and Tauranga, with the muru continuing until late July 1832. In February 1833 Tītore consulted the Tohunga, Tohitapu to foresee the success of a second war expedition; then Tītore led a party of Te Rarawa, allies of the Ngāpuhi, back to Tauranga. Williams also accompanied the second expedition.\n\nMuru is the negative or revenge side of the Maori cultural practice of utu, carried out by taua, which can be either positive or negative. It was within Māori traditions for a taua to conduct muru against hapu who had no involvement in the events that caused the death of the chief. Often muru was preceded by a tribal or hapu discussion as to what action should take place. Normally muru was an act by taua to balance an act of violence or theft. In the early days of European settlers muru was practiced against settlers who had transgressed against Maori lore. Often settlers were bewildered by apparent random thefts or acts of violence. Sometimes, especially in the north, chiefs would intercede to give a cultural explanation to settlers and arrange a suitable payment of goods in compensation. In Maori society it was accepted that muru could be carried out against strangers. This had the appearance of arbitrary attacks on innocent parties. This led to a direct conflict with New Zealand law where only the guilty could be punished. In 1847 in Whanganui a Maori chief was accidentally shot in the face on a ship. He accepted that his wound was an accident. His wound was tended to by a doctor and the man recovered but a taua decided to take muru for the accident by attacking a local farmer /artist. He escaped, but the taua killed four members of the family and wounded two more. When five of the taua were caught by Maori the taua were found to be 14 and 19 year olds. All, apart from the 14 year old were found guilty of murder and hanged. The 14 year old was banished.\n\nTaua would typically restrict their activity to the fighting season, between late November and early April, when food and fishing was plentiful. During the height of the musket wars Taua were away from their turangawaiwai for up to a year. By 1830 they were no longer dependent on traditional crops such as kumara which only grew well in the north most part of North Island, the Iwi now grew large quantities of more easily grown potatoes.\n\nThe taua would usually attack at dawn in the form of an ambush or a surprise raid. Their intimate knowledge of New Zealand’s natural environment enabled them to appear and disappear swiftly and noiselessly and successfully complete their mission. As Maori at the time were strongly committed to the idea of \"utu\" (revenge), the aim would be to kill all members of the enemy war party and leave no survivors. There were, however, occasions when warring taua would come to a truce. This would be typically settled through the arrangement of an intertribal marriage.\n\nThe haka was a central feature to the life and culture of each taua. Other customs and rites included abstinence of certain foods and practices, dedication to Tumatauenga, the god of war, and rites that would place a \"tapu\" around the warrior, and lift the tapu when the warrior returned home. It was customary to eat the vanquished or to take slaves which could be eaten later or used as slave labour. Heads of defeated chiefs were kept as trophies and displayed on palisades of the home \"pa\".\n\n\"Taua\" (aka \"War Party\") is a 2007 short film written and directed by Te Arepa Kahi.\n\n"}

{"id": "163174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=163174", "title": "Turkestan", "text": "Turkestan\n\nTurkestan, also spelt Turkistan (literally \"Land of the Turks\" in Persian), refers to an area in Central Asia between Siberia to the north and Iran, Afghanistan, Kashmir, and Tibet to the south, the Caspian Sea to the west and the Gobi Desert to the east. \n\nOf Persian origin (see -stan), the term \"Turkestan\" (ترکستان) has never referred to a single national state. Iranian geographers first used the word to describe the place of Turkic peoples.\n\n\"Turkestan\" was used to describe any place where Turkic peoples lived.\n\nOn their way southward during the conquest of Central Asia in the course of the 19th century, the Russians under took the city of Turkistan (in present-day Kazakhstan) in 1864. Mistaking its name for that of the entire region, they adopted the name of \"Turkestan\" () for their new territory. \n\n, the term labels a region in Central Asia which is inhabited mainly by Turkic peoples, but the regions also contained peoples who were not Turkic, such as the Tajiks, and excluded some who were. It includes present-day Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and parts of Xinjiang (also known as East Turkestan). Often, the Turkic regions of Afghanistan and Russia (Tatarstan and parts of Siberia) are included as well.\n\nThe history of Turkestan dates back to at least the third millennium BC. Many artifacts were produced in that period, and much trade was conducted. The region was a focal point for cultural diffusion, as the Silk Road traversed it. Turkestan covers the area of Central Asia and acquired its \"Turkic\" character from the 4th to 6th centuries AD with the incipient Turkic expansion.\n\nTurkic sagas, such as the \"Ergenekon\" legend, and written sources such as the Orkhon Inscriptions state that Turkic peoples originated in the nearby Altai Mountains, and, through nomadic settlement, started their long journey westwards. Huns conquered the area after they conquered Kashgaria in the early 2nd century BC. With the dissolution of the Huns' empire, Chinese rulers took over Eastern Turkestan. Arab forces captured it in the 8th century. The Persian Samanid dynasty subsequently conquered it and the area experienced economic success. The entire territory was held at various times by Turkic forces, such as the Göktürks until the conquest by Genghis Khan and the Mongols in 1220. Genghis Khan gave the territory to his son, Chagatai and the area became the Chagatai Khanate. Timur took over the western portion of Turkestan in 1369 and the area became part of the Timurid Empire. The eastern portion of Turkestan was also called Mogulistan, and continued to be ruled by descendants of Genghis Khan.\n\nKnown as Turan to the Persians, western Turkestan has also been known historically as Sogdiana, \"Ma wara'u'n-nahr\" (by its Arab conquerors), and Transoxiana by Western travellers. The latter two names refer to its position beyond the River Oxus when approached from the south, emphasizing Turkestan's long-standing relationship with Iran, the Persian Empires and the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates.\n\nTurkestan is roughly within the regions of Central Asia lying between Siberia on the north; Tibet, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran on the south; the Gobi Desert on the east; and the Caspian Sea on the west. Oghuz Turks (also known as Turkmens), Uzbeks, Kazakhs, Khazars, Kyrgyz, Hazara and Uyghurs are some of the Turkic inhabitants of the region who, as history progressed, have spread further into Eurasia forming such Turkic nations as Turkey and Azerbaijan, and subnational regions like Tatarstan in Russia and Crimea in Ukraine. Tajiks and Russians form sizable non-Turkic minorities.\n\nIt is subdivided into Afghan Turkestan and Russian Turkestan in the West, and Xinjiang in the East.\n\nA summary of Classical sources, largely Pliny and Ptolemy, on the Seres, the Greek and Roman name of China, gives the following account:\n\nIn the Persian epic Shahnameh, China and Turkestan are regarded as the same, and the Khan of Turkestan is called the Khan of Chin.\n\nAladdin, an Arabic Islamic story which is set in China, may have been referring to Turkestan.\n\nMuslim writers like Marwazī wrote that Transoxania was a former part of China, retaining the legacy of Tang Dynasty's rule over Transoxania:\n\nMuslim writers viewed the Khitai, the Gansu Uyghur kingdom and Kashgar as all part of \"China\" culturally and geographically, with the Muslims in Central Asia retaining the legacy of Chinese rule in Central Asia by using titles such as \"Khan of China\" (تمغاج خان) (Tamghaj Khan or Tawgach) in Turkic and \"the King of the East in China\" (ملك المشرق (أو الشرق) والصين) (malik al-mashriq (or al-sharq) wa'l-ṣīn) in Arabic, which were titles of the Muslim Qarakhanid rulers and their Qarluq ancestors.\n\nThe title Malik al-Mashriq wa'l-Ṣīn was bestowed by the 'Abbāsid Caliph upon the Tamghaj Khan, the Samarqand Khaqan Yūsuf b. Ḥasan. Afterwards, coins and literature had the title Tamghaj Khan appear on them, which continued to be used by the Qarakhanids, the Transoxania-based Western Qarakhanids and some Eastern Qarakhanid monarchs. Therefore, the Kara-Khitan (Western Liao)'s usage of Chinese things such as Chinese coins, the Chinese writing system, tablets, seals, Chinese art and other items from Chinese culture such as porcelein, mirrors, and jade was designed to appeal to the local Central Asian Muslim population, since the Muslims in the area regarded Central Asia as former Chinese territories and viewed connections with China as prestigious. Western Liao's rule over Muslim Central Asia reinforced these Muslims' view that Central Asia was a Chinese territory. For example, Turkestan and Chīn (China) were identified with each other by Fakhr al-Dīn Mubārak Shāh, with China being identified as the country where the cities of Balāsāghūn and Kashghar were located.\n\nThe Liao Chinese traditions and the Qara Khitai's clinging helped the Qara Khitai avoid Islamization and conversion to Islam. The Qara Khitai used Chinese and Central Asian features in their administrative system.\n\nAlthough in modern Urdu Chin means China, Chin referred to Central Asia in Muhammad Iqbal's time, which is why Iqbal wrote that \"Chin is ours\" (referring to the Muslims) in his song Tarana-e-Milli.\n\nThe Tang Chinese reign over Qocho and Turfan and the Buddhist religion left a lasting legacy upon the Buddhist Uyghur Kingdom of Qocho with the Tang presented names remaining on the more than 50 Buddhist temples with Emperor Tang Taizong's edicts stored in the \"Imperial Writings Tower \" and Chinese dictionaries like Jingyun, Yuian, Tang yun, and da zang jing (Buddhist scriptures) stored inside the Buddhist temples and Persian monks also maintained a Manichaean temple in the Kingdom., the Persian Hudud al-'Alam uses the name \"Chinese town\" to call Qocho, the capital of the Uyghur kingdom.\n\nThe Turfan Buddhist Uighurs of the Kingdom of Qocho continued to produce the Chinese Qieyun rime dictionary and developed their own pronunciations of Chinese characters, left over from the Tang influence over the area.\n\nThe modern Uyghur linguist Abdurishid Yakup pointed out that the Turfan Uyghur Buddhists studied the Chinese language and had Chinese books such as Qianziwen (the thousand character classic) and Qieyun *(a rhyme dictionary) and it was written that \"In Qocho city were more than fifty monasteries, all titles of which are granted by the emperors of the Tang dynasty, which keep many Buddhist texts as Tripitaka, Tangyun, Yupuan, Jingyin etc.\"\nIn Central Asia the Uighurs viewed the Chinese script as \"very prestigious\" so when they developed the Old Uyghur alphabet, based on the Syriac script, they deliberately switched it to vertical like Chinese writing from its original horizontal position in Syriac.\n\nThe last major victory of Arabs in Central Asia occurred at the Battle of Talas (751). The Tibetan Empire was allied to the Arabs during the battle. Because the Arabs did not proceed to Xinjiang at all, the battle was of no importance strategically, and it was An Lushan's rebellion which ended up forcing the Tang Chinese out of Central Asia. Despite the conversion of some Karluk Turks after the Battle of Talas, the majority of Karluks did not convert to Islam until the mid 10th century, when they established the Kara-Khanid Khanate. This was long after the Tang dynasty was gone from Central Asia. \n\nBarthold states that the Islamic rule over Transoxiana was secured at the Battle of Talas. Turks had to wait two and a half centuries before reconquering Transoxiana when the Karakhanids reconquered the city of Bukhara in 999. Professor Denis Sinor said that it was interference in the internal affairs of the Western Turkic Khaganate which ended Chinese supremacy in Central Asia, since the destruction of the Western Khaganate rid the Muslims of their greatest opponent, and it was not the Battle of Talas which ended the Chinese presence.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "51962", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51962", "title": "Vulgar Latin", "text": "Vulgar Latin\n\nVulgar Latin or Sermo Vulgaris (\"common speech\"), also Colloquial Latin, or Common Romance (particularly in the late stage), was a range of non-standard sociolects of Latin (as opposed to Classical Latin, the standard and literary version of the language) spoken in the Mediterranean region during and after the classical period of the Roman Empire.\n\nThe Romance languages, such as French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Romanian were all derived from Vulgar Latin. Compared to Classical Latin, Vulgar Latin is less standardized and was spoken as a living language until the 8th century.\n\nWorks written in Latin during classical times and the earlier Middle Ages used prescribed Classical Latin rather than Vulgar Latin, with very few exceptions (most notably sections of Gaius Petronius' \"Satyricon\"), thus Vulgar Latin had no official orthography of its own. In Renaissance Latin, Vulgar Latin was called \"vulgare Latinum\" or \"Latinum vulgare.\"\n\nBy its nature Vulgar Latin varied greatly by region and by time period, though several major divisions can be seen. Vulgar Latin dialects began to significantly diverge from Classical Latin by the third century during the classical period of the Roman Empire. Nevertheless, throughout the sixth century the most widely spoken dialects were still similar to and mostly mutually intelligible with Classical Latin. \n\nLatin changed from being a \"living natural mother tongue\"...\" to being a language foreign to all, which could not even be used or understood even by Romance-speakers except as a result of deliberate and systematic study, Herman op. cit. p. 110. If a date is wanted \"we could say Latin 'died' in the first part of the eighth century,\" Herman. p 115 and after a long period 650–800 A.D. of rapidly accelerating changes, Herman p. 119. Even after the end of Classical Latin people had no other names for the languages they spoke than Latin or lingua romana or lingua romana rustica (to distinguish it from the formal Latin) for 200-300 years. Modern people call these languages proto-Romance. \n\nThe flaw in the death metaphor for Latin is summarized in the first line of Wright's essay, \"Did Latin die?\": \"Latin isn't dead, you know.\" Wright explains that the hundreds of millions of people whose first language is one of Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, Rumanian, Catalan, etc., speak evolved Latin as surely as English speakers use the evolved continuation of Old English. While traditional Classical Latin was eventually reduced in use as a written code and abandoned as a useful secondary \"roof language\" (Dachsprache), naturally spoken Latin changed as all languages do. \n\nIn terms of regional differences for the whole Latin period \"we can only glimpse a tiny amount of divergence with the actual written data. In texts of all kinds, literary, technical, and all others, the written Latin of the first five or six centuries A.D. looks as if it were territorially homogeneous, even in its \"vulgar\" register. It is only in the later texts, of the seventh and eighth centuries, that we are able to see in the texts geographical differences that seem to be the precursors of similar differences in the subsequent Romance languages.\" Herman, op. cit. p. 117.\n\nIn the Eastern Roman Empire Latin faded as the Court language in the course of the 5th century. The Vulgar Latin spoken in the Balkans north of Greece became heavily influenced by Greek and Slavic (Vulgar Latin already had Greek loanwords before the Roman Empire) and also became radically different from Classical Latin and from the proto-Romance of Western Europe.\n\nThe term \"common speech\" (\"sermo vulgaris\"), which later became \"Vulgar Latin\", was used by inhabitants of the Roman Empire. Subsequently it became a technical term from Latin and Romance-language philology referring to the unwritten varieties of a Latinised language spoken mainly by Italo-Celtic populations governed by the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire.\n\nTraces of their language appear in some inscriptions, such as graffiti or advertisements. The educated population mainly responsible for Classical Latin may also have spoken Vulgar Latin in certain contexts depending on their socioeconomic background. The term was first used improperly in that sense by the pioneers of Romance-language philology: François Juste Marie Raynouard (1761–1836) and Friedrich Christian Diez (1794–1876).\n\nIn the course of his studies on the lyrics of songs written by the troubadours of Provence, which had already been studied by Dante Alighieri and published in \"De vulgari eloquentia\", Raynouard noticed that the Romance languages derived in part from lexical, morphological, and syntactic features that were Latin, but were not preferred in Classical Latin. He hypothesized an intermediate phase and identified it with the \"Romana lingua\", a term that in countries speaking Romance languages meant \"nothing more or less than the vulgar speech as opposed to literary or grammatical Latin\".\n\nDiez, the principal founder of Romance-language philology, impressed by the comparative methods of Jakob Grimm in \"Deutsche Grammatik\", which came out in 1819 and was the first to use such methods in philology, decided to apply them to the Romance languages and discovered Raynouard's work, \"Grammaire comparée des langues de l'Europe latine dans leurs rapports avec la langue des troubadours\", published in 1821. Describing himself as a pupil of Raynouard, he went on to expand the concept to all Romance languages, not just the speech of the troubadours, on a systematic basis, thereby becoming the originator of a new field of scholarly inquiry.\n\nDiez, in his signal work on the topic, \"Grammar of the Romance Languages,\" after enumerating six Romance languages that he compared: Italian and Wallachian (\"i.e.\", Romanian) (east); Spanish and Portuguese (southwest); and Provençal and French (northwest), asserts that they had their origin in Latin – but \"not from classical Latin,\" rather \"from the Roman popular language or popular dialect\". These terms, as he points out later in the work, are a translation into German of Dante's \"vulgare latinum\" and \"Latinum vulgare\", and the Italian of Boccaccio, \"latino volgare\". These names in turn are at the end of a tradition extending to the Roman republic.\n\nThe concepts and vocabulary from which \"vulgare latinum\" descend were known in the classical period and are to be found amply represented in the unabridged Latin dictionary, starting in the late Roman republic. Marcus Tullius Cicero was a prolific writer. His works have survived in large quantity, and serve as a standard of Latin. He and his contemporaries recognized the \"lingua Latina\"; but they also knew varieties of \"speech\" under the name '. Latin could be \"sermo Latinus\", but there was also a variety known as \"sermo vulgaris\", \"sermo vulgi\", \"sermo plebeius\" and \"sermo quotidianus\". These modifiers inform post-classical readers that a conversational Latin existed, which was used by the masses (') in daily speaking (') and was perceived as lower-class (').\n\nThese vocabulary items manifest no opposition to the written language. There was an opposition to higher-class, or family Latin (good family) in \"sermo familiaris\" and very rarely literature might be termed \"sermo nobilis\". The supposed \"sermo classicus\" is a scholarly fiction unattested in the dictionary. All kinds of \"sermo\" were spoken only, not written. If one wanted to refer to what in post-classical times was called classical Latin one resorted to the concept of ' (\"latinity\") or ' (adverb). \n\nIf one spoke in the \"lingua\" or \"sermo Latinus\" one merely spoke Latin, but if one spoke ' or ' (\"more Latinish\") one spoke good Latin, and formal Latin had \"\", the quality of good Latin, about it. After the fall of the empire and the transformation of spoken Latin into the early Romance languages the only representative of the Latin language was written Latin, which became known as \"classicus\", \"classy\" Latin. The original opposition was between formal or implied good Latin and informal or Vulgar Latin. The spoken/written dichotomy is entirely philological.\n\nVulgar Latin is a blanket term covering the popular dialects and sociolects of the Latin language throughout its range, from the hypothetical \"prisca latinitas\" of unknown or poorly remembered times in early Latium, to the language spoken around the fall of the empire. Although making it clear that \"sermo vulgaris\" existed, ancient writers said very little about it. Because it was not transcribed, it can only be studied indirectly. Knowledge comes from these chief sources:\n\nThe original written Latin language (what is today referred to as \"Classical Latin\") was adapted from the actual spoken language of the Latins, with some minor modifications, long before the rise of the Roman Empire. As with many languages, over time the spoken \"vulgar\" language diverged from the written language, with the written language remaining somewhat static. During the classical period spoken (Vulgar) Latin still remained largely common across the Empire, some minor dialectal differences notwithstanding. \n\nThe collapse of the Western Roman Empire rapidly began to change this. The former western provinces became increasingly isolated from the Eastern Roman Empire, leading to a rapid divergence between the Latin spoken on either side of the Adriatic north of line that ran from northern Albania mid-way through Bulgaria but stopped short of the Black Sea coast which was Greek-speaking. In the West an even more complex transformation was occurring. A blending of cultures was occurring between the former Roman citizens who were fluent in the \"proper\" Latin speech (which was already substantially different from Classical Latin), and many of the Gothic rulers who, though largely Latinised, tended to speak Latin poorly, speaking what could be considered a pidgin of Latin and their Germanic mother tongue, though this changed over time. Notable among those who spoke Latin well is Theodoric the Great, imperial regent of Italy (493–526) who is reputed to have been illiterate based on his use of stamp to sign documents. Since he lived as a hostage of Emperor Leo I at the Great Palace of Constantinople from 461 to 471 (from age 7 to 17) and was well-educated by Constantinople's best teachers, it difficult to believe he did not know Greek and Latin.\n\nThe vulgar Latin language that continued to evolve after the establishment of the successor kingdoms of the Roman State incorporated Germanic vocabulary, but with minimal influences from Germanic grammar (Germanic languages did not displace Latin except in northern Belgium, England, the Rhineland Moselle region and north of the Alps). For a few centuries this language remained relatively common across most of Western Europe (as a result, Italian, Spanish, French, etc. are far more similar to each other than to Classical Latin), though regional dialects were already developing. As early as 722, in a face to face meeting between Pope Gregory II, born and raised in Rome, and Saint Boniface, an Anglo-Saxon, Boniface complained that he found Pope Gregory's Latin speech difficult to understand, a clear sign of the transformation of Vulgar Latin in two regions of western Europe.\n\nAlthough diverging Classical Latin and Vulgar Latin were still viewed as the same language, although increasingly divergent, Latin and the Romance Languages in the Early Middle Ages. At the third Council of Tours in 813, priests were ordered to preach in the vernacular language – either in the \"rustica lingua romanica\" (Vulgar Latin), or in the Germanic vernaculars – since the common people could no longer understand formal Latin. Within a generation, the Oaths of Strasbourg (842), a treaty between Charlemagne's grandsons Charles the Bald and Louis the German, was proffered and recorded in a language that was already distinct from Latin. József Herman states: \n\nBy the end of the first millennium, local speech had diverged to the point that distinct languages are recognizable; names were emerging for these; and some of the more geographically distant ones may have become mutually unintelligible. With the evolved Latin vernaculars viewed as different languages with local norms, specific orthographies were duly developed for some. Since all modern Romance varieties are continuations of this evolution, Vulgar Latin is not extinct but survives in variously evolved forms as today's Romance languages and dialects. In Romance-speaking Europe, recognition of the common origin of Romance varieties was replaced by labels recognizing and implicitly accentuating local differences in linguistic features. Some Romance languages evolved more than others. In terms of phonological structures, for example, a clear hierarchy from conservative to innovative is found in a comparison of modern Italian, Spanish and French (e.g. Latin \"amica\" > Italian \"amica\", Spanish \"amiga\", French \"amie\"; Latin \"caput\" > Italian \"capo\", Spanish \"cabo\", French \"chef\").\n\nThe Oaths of Strasbourg offer indications of the state of Gallo-Romance toward the middle of the 9th century. While the language cannot be said with any degree of certainty to be Old French in the sense of the linear precursor to today's standard French, the abundance of Gallo-Romance features provides a glimpse of some particulars of Vulgar Latin's evolution on French soil.\n\nVulgar Latin featured a large vocabulary of words that were productive in Romance.\n\nThere was no single pronunciation of Vulgar Latin, and the pronunciation of Vulgar Latin in the various Latin-speaking areas is indistinguishable from the earlier history of the phonology of the Romance languages. See the article on Romance languages for more information.\n\nEvidence of phonological changes can be seen in the late 3rd-century Appendix Probi, a collection of glosses prescribing correct classical Latin forms for certain vulgar forms. These glosses describe:\n\nMany of the forms castigated in the \"Appendix Probi\" proved to be the forms accepted in Romance; e.g., \"oricla\" (evolved from the Classical Latin marked diminutive \"auricula\") is the source of French \"oreille\", Catalan \"orella\", Spanish \"oreja\", Italian \"orecchia\", Romanian \"ureche\", Portuguese \"orelha\", Sardinian \"origra\" 'ear', not the prescribed \"auris\". Development of yod from the post-nasal unstressed /e/ of \"vinea\" enabled the palatalization of /n/ that would produce French \"vigne\", Italian \"vigna\", Spanish \"viña\", Portuguese \"vinha\", Catalan \"vinya\", Occitan \"vinha\", Friulan \"vigne\", etc., 'vineyard'.\n\nThe most significant consonant changes affecting Vulgar Latin were palatalization (except in Sardinia); lenition, including simplification of geminate consonants (in areas north and west of the La Spezia–Rimini Line, e.g. Spanish \"digo\" vs. Italian \"dico\" 'I say', Spanish \"boca\" vs. Italian \"bocca\" 'mouth'); and loss of final consonants.\n\nThe loss of final consonants was already under way by the 1st century AD in some areas. A graffito at Pompeii reads , which in Classical Latin would read (\"may whoever loves be strong/do well\"). (The change from to is also an early indicator of the development of (yod), which played such an important part in the development of palatalization.) On the other hand, this loss of final was not general. Old Spanish and Old French preserved a reflex of final up through 1100 AD or so, and modern French still maintains final in some liaison environments.\n\nAreas north and west of the La Spezia–Rimini Line lenited intervocalic to . This phenomenon is occasionally attested during the imperial period, but it became frequent by the 7th century. For example, in Merovingian documents, > \"rodatico\" (\"wheel tax\").\n\nReduction of bisyllabic clusters of identical consonants to a single syllable-initial consonant also typifies Romance north and west of La Spezia-Rimini. The results in Italian and Spanish provide clear illustrations: > Italian \"secco\", Spanish \"seco\"; > Italian \"ceppo\", Spanish \"cepo\"; > Italian \"mettere\", Spanish \"meter\". \n\nThe loss of the final \"m\" was a process which seems to have begun by the time of the earliest monuments of the Latin language. The epitaph of Lucius Cornelius Scipio Barbatus, who died around 150 BC, reads , which in Classical Latin would be (\"He captured Taurasia, Cisauna, and Samnium\"). This however can be explained in a different way, that the inscription simply fails to note the nasality of the final vowels (just as \"consul\" was customarily abbreviated as )\n\nConfusions between \"b\" and \"v\" show that the Classical semivowel , and intervocalic partially merged to become a bilabial fricative (Classical semivowel became in Vulgar Latin, while became an allophone of in intervocalic position). Already by the 1st century AD, a document by one Eunus writes for and for . In most of the Romance varieties, this sound would further develop into , with the notable exception of the betacist varieties of Hispano-Romance: \"b\" and \"v\" represent the same phoneme /b/ (with allophone [β]) in Modern Spanish, as well as in Galician, northern Portuguese and the northern dialects of Catalan.\n\nIn general, many clusters were simplified in Vulgar Latin. For example, reduced to , reflecting the fact that syllable-final was no longer phonetically consonantal. In some inscriptions, > \"mesis\" (\"month\"), or > \"cosul\" (\"consul\"). Descendants of include Portuguese \"mês\", Spanish and Catalan \"mes\", Old French \"meis\" (Modern French \"mois\"), Italian \"mese\". In some areas (including much of Italy), the clusters , , were assimilated to the second element: , , . Thus, some inscriptions have > \"onibus\" (\"all [dative plural]\"), > \"inditione\" (\"indiction\"), > \"bissit\" (\"lived\"). Also, three-consonant clusters usually lost the middle element. For example: > \"imtores\" (\"buyers\") \n\nNot all areas show the same development of these clusters, however. In the East, Italian has > , as in > \"otto\" (\"eight\") or > \"notte\" (\"night\"); while Romanian has > (\"opt\", \"noapte\"). By contrast, in the West, the weakened to . In French and Portuguese, this came to form a diphthong with the previous vowel (\"huit\", \"oito\"; \"nuit\", \"noite\"), while in Spanish, the [i] brought about palatalization of , which produced (\"*oito\" > \"ocho\", \"*noite\" > \"noche\") \n\nAlso, many clusters including were simplified. Several of these groups seem to have never been fully stable (e.g. \"facunt\" for ). This dropping has resulted in the word (\"wall\") developing as Italian \"parete\", Romanian \"părete>perete\", Portuguese \"parede\", Spanish \"pared\", or French \"paroi\" (Old French \"pareid\").\n\nThe cluster was simplified to in most instances before /i/ and /e/. In 435, one can find the hypercorrective spelling \"quisquentis\" for (\"of the person who rests here\"). Modern languages have followed this trend, for example Latin (\"who\") has become Italian \"chi\" and French \"qui\" (both ); while (\"whom\") became \"quien\" () in Spanish and \"quem\" () in Portuguese. However, has survived in front of in most areas, although not in French; hence Latin yields Spanish \"cuatro\" (), Portuguese \"quatro\" (), and Italian \"quattro\" (), but French \"quatre\" (), where the \"qu-\" spelling is purely etymological.\n\nIn Spanish, most words with consonant clusters in syllable-final position are loanwords from Classical Latin, examples are: \"transporte\" , \"transmitir\" , \"instalar\" , \"constante\" , \"obstante\" , \"obstruir\" , \"perspectiva\" , \"istmo\" . A syllable-final position cannot be more than one consonant (one of n, r, l, s or z) in most (or all) dialects in colloquial speech, reflecting Vulgar Latin background. Realizations like , , , , , , and are very common, and in many cases, they are considered acceptable even in formal speech.\n\nIn general, the ten-vowel system of Classical Latin, which relied on phonemic vowel length, was newly modelled into one in which vowel length distinctions lost phonemic importance, and qualitative distinctions of height became more prominent.\n\nClassical Latin had 10 different vowel phonemes, grouped into five pairs of short-long, . It also had four diphthongs, , and the rare diphthong . Finally, there were also long and short , representing , in Greek borrowings, which, however, probably came to be pronounced , even before Romance vowel changes started.\n\nAt least since the 1st century AD, short vowels (except \"a\") differed by quality as well as by length from their long counterparts, the short vowels being lower. Thus the vowel inventory is usually reconstructed as , , , , .\n\nMany diphthongs had begun their monophthongization very early. It is presumed that by Republican times, had become in unstressed syllables, a phenomenon that would spread to stressed positions around the 1st century AD. From the 2nd century AD, there are instances of spellings with instead of . was always a rare diphthong in Classical Latin (in Old Latin, \"oinos\" regularly became (\"one\") and became during early Imperial times. Thus, one can find \"penam\" for .\n\nHowever, lasted much longer. While it was monophthongized to in areas of north and central Italy (including Rome), it was retained in most Vulgar Latin, and it survives in modern Romanian (for example, \"aur\" < ). There is evidence in French and Spanish that the monophthongization of \"au\" occurred independently in those languages.\n\nLength confusions seem to have begun in unstressed vowels, but they were soon generalized. In the 3rd century AD, Sacerdos mentions people's tendency to shorten vowels at the end of a word, while some poets (like Commodian) show inconsistencies between long and short vowels in versification. However, the loss of contrastive length caused only the merger of and while the rest of pairs remained distinct in quality: , , , , .\n\nAlso, the near-close vowels and became more open in most varieties and merged with and respectively. As a result, the reflexes of Latin \"pira\" \"pear\" and \"vēra\" \"true\" rhyme in most Romance languages: Italian and Spanish \"pera\", \"vera\". Similarly, Latin \"nucem\" \"walnut\" and \"vōcem\" \"voice\" become Italian \"noce, voce\", Portuguese \"noz, voz\".\n\nThere was likely some regional variation in pronunciation, as the Romanian languages and Sardinian evolved differently. In Sardinian, all corresponding short and long vowels simply merged with each other, creating a 5-vowel system: . In Romanian, the front vowels \"ĕ, ĭ, ē, ī\" evolved like the Western languages, but the back vowels \"ŏ, ŭ, ō, ū\" evolved as in Sardinian. A few Southern Italian languages, such as southern Corsican, northernmost Calabrian and southern Lucanian, behave like Sardinian with its penta-vowel system or, in case of Vegliote (even if only partially) and western Lucanian, like Romanian.\n\nThe placement of stress did not change from Classical to Vulgar Latin, and words continued to be stressed on the same syllable they were before. However, the loss of distinctive length disrupted the correlation between syllable weight and stress placement that existed in Classical Latin. Where in Classical Latin the place of the accent was predictable from the structure of the word, it was no longer so in Vulgar Latin. Stress had become a phonological property and could serve to distinguish forms that were otherwise homophones.\n\nAfter the Classical Latin vowel length distinctions were lost in favor of vowel quality, a new system of allophonic vowel quantity appeared sometime between the 4th and 5th centuries. Around then, stressed vowels in open syllables came to be pronounced long (but still keeping height contrasts), and all the rest became short. For example, long \"venis\" , \"fori\" , \"cathedra\" ; but short \"vendo\" , \"formas\" . (This allophonic length distinction persists to this day in Italian.) However, in some regions of Iberia and Gaul, all stressed vowels came to be pronounced long: for example, \"porta\" , \"tempus\" . In many descendents, several of the long vowels underwent some form of diphthongization, most extensively in Old French where five of the seven long vowels were affected by breaking.\n\nIt is difficult to place the point in which the definite article, absent in Latin but present in all Romance languages, arose, largely because the highly colloquial speech in which it arose was seldom written down until the daughter languages had strongly diverged; most surviving texts in early Romance show the articles fully developed.\n\nDefinite articles evolved from demonstrative pronouns or adjectives (an analogous development is found in many Indo-European languages, including Greek, Celtic and Germanic); compare the fate of the Latin demonstrative adjective \", , \" \"that\", in the Romance languages, becoming French ' and ' (Old French \"li\", \"lo\", \"la\"), Catalan and Spanish ', ' and ', Portuguese ' and ' (elision of -l- is a common feature of Portuguese), and Italian ', ' and '. Sardinian went its own way here also, forming its article from \", \" \"this\" (\"su, sa\"); some Catalan and Occitan dialects have articles from the same source. While most of the Romance languages put the article before the noun, Romanian has its own way, by putting the article after the noun, e.g. \"lupul\" (\"the wolf\" – from *\"lupum illum\") and \"omul\" (\"the man\" – \"*homo illum\"), possibly a result of its membership in the Balkan sprachbund.\n\nThis demonstrative is used in a number of contexts in some early texts in ways that suggest that the Latin demonstrative was losing its force. The Vetus Latina Bible contains a passage \"Est tamen ille daemon sodalis peccati\" (\"The devil is a companion of sin\"), in a context that suggests that the word meant little more than an article. The need to translate sacred texts that were originally in Koine Greek, which had a definite article, may have given Christian Latin an incentive to choose a substitute. Aetheria uses \"ipse\" similarly: \"per mediam vallem ipsam\" (\"through the middle of the valley\"), suggesting that it too was weakening in force.\n\nAnother indication of the weakening of the demonstratives can be inferred from the fact that at this time, legal and similar texts begin to swarm with ', ', and so forth (all meaning, essentially, \"aforesaid\"), which seem to mean little more than \"this\" or \"that\". Gregory of Tours writes, \"Erat autem... beatissimus Anianus in supradicta civitate episcopus\" (\"Blessed Anianus was bishop in that city.\") The original Latin demonstrative adjectives were no longer felt to be strong or specific enough. \n\nIn less formal speech, reconstructed forms suggest that the inherited Latin demonstratives were made more forceful by being compounded with ' (originally an interjection: \"behold!\"), which also spawned Italian ' through ', a contracted form of \"ecce eum\". This is the origin of Old French ' (*\"ecce ille\"), ' (*\"ecce iste\") and ' (*\"ecce hic\"); Italian ' (*\"eccum istum\"), ' (*\"eccum illum\") and (now mainly Tuscan) ' (*\"eccum tibi istum\"), as well as ' (*\"eccu hic\"), ' (*\"eccum hac\"); Spanish ' and Portuguese ' (*\"eccum ille\"); Spanish ' and Portuguese ' (*\"eccum hac\"); Spanish ' and Portuguese ' (*\"eccum hic\"); Portuguese ' (*\"eccum illac\") and ' (*\"eccum inde\"); Romanian ' (*\"ecce iste\") and \"\" (*\"ecce ille\"), and many other forms.\n\nOn the other hand, even in the Oaths of Strasbourg, no demonstrative appears even in places where one would clearly be called for in all the later languages (\"pro christian poblo\" – \"for the Christian people\"). Using the demonstratives as articles may have still been considered overly informal for a royal oath in the 9th century. Considerable variation exists in all of the Romance vernaculars as to their actual use: in Romanian, the articles are suffixed to the noun (or an adjective preceding it), as in other members of the Balkan sprachbund and the North Germanic languages.\n\nThe numeral \", una\" (one) supplies the indefinite article in all cases (again, this is a common semantic development across Europe). This is anticipated in Classical Latin; Cicero writes \"cum uno gladiatore nequissimo\" (\"with a most immoral gladiator\"). This suggests that \"unus\" was beginning to supplant \"\" in the meaning of \"a certain\" or \"some\" by the 1st century BC.\n\nThe three grammatical genders of Classical Latin were replaced by a two-gender system in most Romance languages.\n\nThe neuter gender of classical Latin was in most cases identical with the masculine both syntactically and morphologically. The confusion starts already in Pompeian graffiti, e.g., \"cadaver mortuus\" for \"cadaver mortuum\" (\"dead body\"), and \"hoc locum\" for \"hunc locum\" (\"this place\"). The morphological confusion shows primarily in the adoption of the nominative ending \"-us\" (\"-Ø\" after \"-r\") in the \"o\"-declension. \n\nIn Petronius' work, one can find \"balneus\" for (\"bath\"), \"fatus\" for ' (\"fate\"), \"caelus\" for ' (\"heaven\"), \"amphitheater\" for ' (\"amphitheatre\"), \"vinus\" for ' (\"wine\"), and conversely, \"thesaurum\" for \"\" (\"treasure\"). Most of these forms occur in the speech of one man: Trimalchion, an uneducated Greek (i.e., foreign) freedman.\n\nIn modern Romance languages, the nominative \"s\"-ending has been largely abandoned, and all substantives of the \"o\"-declension have an ending derived from \"-um\": \"-u\", \"-o\", or \"-Ø\". E.g., masculine ' (\"wall\"), and neuter ' (\"sky\") have evolved to: Italian ', '; Portuguese ', '; Spanish ', ', Catalan ', '; Romanian ', \"cieru>\"; French ', \"\". However, Old French still had \"-s\" in the nominative and \"-Ø\" in the accusative in both words: \"murs\", \"ciels\" [nominative] – \"mur\", \"ciel\" [oblique].\nFor some neuter nouns of the third declension, the oblique stem became the productive; for others, the nominative/accusative form, which was identical in Classical Latin. Evidence suggests that the neuter gender was under pressure well back into the imperial period. French \"(le) \", Catalan \"(la) \", Spanish \"(la) \", Portuguese \"(o) \", Italian language \"(il) \", Leonese \"(el) lleche\" and Romanian \"(le)\" (\"milk\"), all derive from the non-standard but attested Latin nominative/accusative neuter ' or accusative masculine '.\n\nNote also that in Spanish the word became feminine, while in French, Portuguese and Italian it became masculine (in Romanian it remained neuter, \"/lăpturi\"). Other neuter forms, however, were preserved in Romance; Catalan and French ', Leonese, Portuguese and Italian ', Romanian ' (\"name\") all preserve the Latin nominative/accusative \"nomen\", rather than the oblique stem form *\"nominem\" (which nevertheless produced Spanish ').\n\nMost neuter nouns had plural forms ending in or ; some of these were reanalysed as feminine singulars, such as ' (\"joy\"), plural \"gaudia\"; the plural form lies at the root of the French feminine singular \"(la) \", as well as of Catalan and Occitan \"(la) \" (Italian \"la \" is a borrowing from French); the same for ' (\"wood stick\"), plural \"ligna\", that originated the Catalan feminine singular noun \"(la) \", and Spanish \"(la) \". Some Romance languages still have a special form derived from the ancient neuter plural which is treated grammatically as feminine: e.g., \"arm(s)\" → Italian \"(il) \" : \"(le) braccia\", Romanian \"\" : \"brațe(le)\". Cf. also Merovingian Latin \"ipsa animalia aliquas mortas fuerant\".\n\nAlternations in Italian heteroclitic nouns such as \"l'uovo fresco\" (\"the fresh egg\") / \"le uova fresche\" (\"the fresh eggs\") are usually analysed as masculine in the singular and feminine in the plural, with an irregular plural in \"-a\". However, it is also consistent with their historical development to say that ' is simply a regular neuter noun (', plural \"ova\") and that the characteristic ending for words agreeing with these nouns is \"-o\" in the singular and \"-e\" in the plural. The same alternation in gender exists in certain Romanian nouns, but is considered regular as it is more common than in Italian. Thus, a relict neuter gender can arguably be said to persist in Italian and Romanian.\n\nIn Portuguese, traces of the neuter plural can be found in collective formations and words meant to inform a bigger size or sturdiness. Thus, one can use \"/ovos\" (\"egg/eggs\") and \"/ovas\" (\"roe\", \"a collection of eggs\"), \"/bordos\" (\"section(s) of an edge\") and \"/bordas\" (\"edge/edges\"), \"/sacos\" (\"bag/bags\") and \"/sacas\" (\"sack/sacks\"), \"/mantos\" (\"cloak/cloaks\") and \"/mantas\" (\"blanket/blankets\"). Other times, it resulted in words whose gender may be changed more or less arbitrarily, like \"/\" (\"fruit\"), \"/\" (broth\"), etc.\n\nThese formations were especially common when they could be used to avoid irregular forms. In Latin, the names of trees were usually feminine, but many were declined in the second declension paradigm, which was dominated by masculine or neuter nouns. Latin ' (\"pear tree\"), a feminine noun with a masculine-looking ending, became masculine in Italian \"(il) \" and Romanian '; in French and Spanish it was replaced by the masculine derivations \"(le) \", \"(el) \"; and in Portuguese and Catalan by the feminine derivations \"(a) \", \"(la) \". \n\nAs usual, irregularities persisted longest in frequently used forms. From the fourth declension noun \"manus\" (\"hand\"), another feminine noun with the ending \"-us\", Italian and Spanish derived \"(la) \", Romanian \"mânu>\" pl (reg.)\"mânule/\", Catalan \"(la) \", and Portuguese \"(a) \", which preserve the feminine gender along with the masculine appearance.\n\nExcept for the Italian and Romanian heteroclitic nouns, other major Romance languages have no trace of neuter nouns, but still have neuter pronouns. French \" / / \" (\"this\"), Spanish \" / / \" (\"this\"), Italian: \" / / \" (\"to him\" /\"to her\" / \"to it\"), Catalan: ', ', ', ' (\"it\" / \"this\" / \"this-that\" / \"that over there\"); Portuguese: \" / / \" (\"all of him\" / \"all of her\" / \"all of it\").\n\nIn Spanish, a three-way contrast is also made with the definite articles ', ', and '. The last is used with nouns denoting abstract categories: \"lo bueno\", literally \"that which is good\", from ': good.\n\nThe Vulgar Latin vowel shifts caused the merger of several case endings in the nominal and adjectival declensions. Some of the causes include: the loss of final \"m\", the merger of \"ă\" with \"ā\", and the merger of \"ŭ\" with \"ō\" (see tables). Thus, by the 5th century, the number of case contrasts had been drastically reduced.\n\nThere also seems to be a marked tendency to confuse different forms even when they have not become homophonous (like in the generally more distinct plurals), which indicates nominal declension was not only shaped by phonetic mergers, but also by structural factors. As a result of the untenability of the noun case system after these phonetic changes, Vulgar Latin shifted from a markedly synthetic language to a more analytic one.\nThe genitive case died out around the 3rd century AD, according to Meyer-Lübke, and began to be replaced by + noun (which originally meant \"about/concerning\", weakened to \"of\") as early as the 2nd century BC . Exceptions of remaining genitive forms are some pronouns, many fossilized combinations like sayings, some proper names, and certain terms related to the church. For example, French ' (\"Thursday\") < Old French \"juesdi\" < Vulgar Latin ; Spanish \"es \" (\"it is necessary\") < ; terms like , ; and Italian ' (\"earthquake\") < as well as names like \"Paoli\", \"Pieri\".\n\nThe dative case lasted longer than the genitive, even though Plautus, in the 2nd century BC, already shows some instances of substitution by the construction + accusative. For example, .\n\nThe accusative case developed as a prepositional case, displacing many instances of the ablative. Towards the end of the imperial period, the accusative came to be used more and more as a general oblique case. \n\nDespite increasing case mergers, nominative and accusative forms seem to have remained distinct for much longer, since they are rarely confused in inscriptions. Even though Gaulish texts from the 7th century rarely confuse both forms, it is believed that both cases began to merge in Africa by the end of the empire, and a bit later in parts of Italy and Iberia. Nowadays, Romanian maintains a two-case system, while Old French and Old Occitan had a two-case subject-oblique system. \n\nThis Old French system was based largely on whether or not the Latin case ending contained an \"s\" or not, with the \"s\" being retained but all vowels in the ending being lost (as with \"veisin\" below). But since this meant that it was easy to confuse the singular nominative with the plural oblique, and the plural nominative with the singular oblique, along with the final \"s\" becoming silent, this case system ultimately collapsed as well, and French adopted one case (usually the oblique) for all purposes, leaving the Romanian the only one to survive to the present day.\nLoss of a productive noun case system meant that the syntactic purposes it formerly served now had to be performed by prepositions and other paraphrases. These particles increased in number, and many new ones were formed by compounding old ones. The descendant Romance languages are full of grammatical particles such as Spanish ', \"where\", from Latin ' + ', or French ', \"since\", from ' + ', while the equivalent Spanish and Portuguese ' is \"de\" + \"ex\" + \"de\". Spanish ' and Portuguese ', \"after\", represent \"de\" + \"ex\" + '.\n\nSome of these new compounds appear in literary texts during the late empire; French ', Spanish \"de \" and Portuguese \"de \" (\"outside\") all represent \"de\" + ' (Romanian ' – \"ad\" + \"foris\"), and we find Jerome writing \"stulti, nonne qui fecit, quod de foris est, etiam id, quod de intus est fecit?\" (Luke 11.40: \"ye fools, did not he, that made which is without, make that which is within also?\"). In some cases, compounds were created by combining a large number of particles, such as the Romanian ' (\"just recently\") from \"ad\" + \"de\" + \"in\" + \"illa\" + \"hora\".\n\nAs Latin was losing its case system, prepositions started to move in to fill the void. In colloquial Latin, the preposition \"ad\" followed by the accusative was sometimes used as a substitute for the dative case.\n\nClassical Latin:\n\nVulgar Latin:\n\nJust as in the disappearing dative case, colloquial Latin sometimes replaced the disappearing genitive case with the preposition \"de\" followed by the ablative, then eventually the accusative (oblique).\n\nClassical Latin:\n\nVulgar Latin:\n\nUnlike in the nominal and adjectival inflections, pronouns kept great part of the case distinctions. However, many changes happened. For example, the of \"ego\" was lost by the end of the empire, and \"eo\" appears in manuscripts from the 6th century.\nClassical Latin had a number of different suffixes that made adverbs from adjectives: ', \"dear\", formed ', \"dearly\"; ', \"fiercely\", from '; ', \"often\", from '. All of these derivational suffixes were lost in Vulgar Latin, where adverbs were invariably formed by a feminine ablative form modifying ', which was originally the ablative of \"mēns\", and so meant \"with a ... mind\". So ' (\"quick\") instead of \"\" (\"quickly\") gave \"veloci mente\" (originally \"with a quick mind\", \"quick-mindedly\")\nThis explains the widespread rule for forming adverbs in many Romance languages: add the suffix -\"ment(e)\" to the feminine form of the adjective. The development illustrates a textbook case of grammaticalization in which an autonomous form, the noun meaning 'mind', while still in free lexical use in e.g. Italian \"venire in mente\" 'come to mind', becomes a productive suffix for forming adverbs in Romance such as Italian ', Spanish ' 'clearly', with both its source and its meaning opaque in that usage other than as adverb formant.\n\nIn general, the verbal system in the Romance languages changed less from Classical Latin than did the nominal system.\n\nThe four conjugational classes generally survived. The second and third conjugations already had identical imperfect tense forms in Latin, and also shared a common present participle. Because of the merging of short \"i\" with long \"ē\" in most of Vulgar Latin, these two conjugations grew even closer together. Several of the most frequently-used forms became indistinguishable, while others became distinguished only by stress placement:\nThese two conjugations came to be conflated in many of the Romance languages, often by merging them into a single class while taking endings from each of the original two conjugations. Which endings survived was different for each language, although most tended to favour second conjugation endings over the third conjugation. Spanish, for example, mostly eliminated the third conjugation forms in favour of second conjugation forms. \n\nFrench and Catalan did the same, but tended to generalise the third conjugation infinitive instead. Catalan in particular almost completely eliminated the second conjugation ending over time, reducing it to a small relic class. In Italian, the two infinitive endings remained separate (but spelled identically), while the conjugations merged in most other respects much as in the other languages. However, the third-conjugation third-person plural present ending survived in favour of the second conjugation version, and was even extended to the fourth conjugation. Romanian also maintained the distinction between the second and third conjugation endings.\n\nIn the perfect, many languages generalized the \"-aui\" ending most frequently found in the first conjugation. This led to an unusual development; phonetically, the ending was treated as the diphthong rather than containing a semivowel , and in other cases the sound was simply dropped. We know this because it did not participate in the sound shift from to . Thus Latin \"amaui\", \"amauit\" (\"I loved; he/she loved\") in many areas became proto-Romance *\"amai\" and *\"amaut\", yielding for example Portuguese \"amei\", \"amou\". This suggests that in the spoken language, these changes in conjugation preceded the loss of .\n\nAnother major systemic change was to the future tense, remodelled in Vulgar Latin with auxiliary verbs. A new future was originally formed with the auxiliary verb \"\", *\"amare habeo\", literally \"to love I have\" (cf. English \"I have to love\", which has shades of a future meaning). This was contracted into a new future suffix in Western Romance forms, which can be seen in the following modern examples of \"I will love\":\n\nA periphrastic construction of the form 'to have to' (late Latin \"habere ad\") used as future is characteristic of Sardinian: \n\nAn innovative conditional (distinct from the subjunctive) also developed in the same way (infinitive + conjugated form of \"habere\"). The fact that the future and conditional endings were originally independent words is still evident in literary Portuguese, which in these tenses allows clitic object pronouns to be incorporated between the root of the verb and its ending: \"I will love\" (\"eu\") \"amarei\", but \"I will love you\" \"amar-te-ei\", from \"amar\" + \"te\" [\"you\"] + (\"eu\") \"hei\" = \"amar\" + \"te\" + [\"h\"]\"ei\" = \"amar-te-ei\".\n\nIn Spanish, Italian and Portuguese, personal pronouns can still be omitted from verb phrases as in Latin, as the endings are still distinct enough to convey that information: \"venio\" > Sp \"vengo\" (\"I come\"). In French, however, all the endings are typically homophonous except the first and second person (and occasionally also third person) plural, so the pronouns are always used (\"je viens\") except in the imperative. \n\nContrary to the millennia-long continuity of much of the active verb system, which has now survived 6000 years of known evolution, the synthetic passive voice was utterly lost in Romance, being replaced with periphrastic verb forms—composed of the verb \"to be\" plus a passive participle—or impersonal reflexive forms—composed of a verb and a passivizing pronoun.\n\nApart from the grammatical and phonetic developments there were many cases of verbs merging as complex subtleties in Latin were reduced to simplified verbs in Romance. A classic example of this are the verbs expressing the concept \"to go\". Consider three particular verbs in Classical Latin expressing concepts of \"going\": ', ', and *\"ambitare\". In Spanish and Portuguese \"ire\" and \"vadere\" merged into the verb \"ir\", which derives some conjugated forms from \"ire\" and some from \"vadere\". \"andar\" was maintained as a separate verb derived from \"ambitare\". \n\nItalian instead merged \"vadere\" and \"ambitare\" into the verb \"\". At the extreme French merged three Latin verbs with, for example, the present tense deriving from \"vadere\" and another verb \"ambulare\" (or something like it) and the future tense deriving from \"ire\". \nSimilarly the Romance distinction between the Romance verbs for \"to be\", ' and ', was lost in French as these merged into the verb '. In Italian, the verb ' inherited both Romance meanings of \"being essentially\" and \"being temporarily of the quality of\", while \"\" specialized into a verb denoting location or dwelling, or state of health.\n\nThe copula (that is, the verb signifying \"to be\") of Classical Latin was '. This evolved to *\"essere\" in Vulgar Latin by attaching the common infinitive suffix \"-re\" to the classical infinitive; this produced Italian ' and French ' through Proto-Gallo-Romance *\"essre\" and Old French ' as well as Spanish and Portuguese \"\" (Romanian \"a \" derives from \"fieri\", which means \"to become\"). \n\nIn Vulgar Latin a second copula developed utilizing the verb ', which originally meant (and is cognate with) \"to stand\", to denote a more temporary meaning. That is, *\"essere\" signified the \"esse\"nce, while \"stare\" signified the \"state.\" \"Stare\" evolved to Spanish and Portuguese ' and Old French \"\" (both through *\"estare\"), while Italian and Romanian retained the original form.\n\nThe semantic shift that underlies this evolution is more or less as follows: A speaker of Classical Latin might have said: \"vir est in foro\", meaning \"the man is in/at the marketplace\". The same sentence in Vulgar Latin could have been *\"(h)omo stat in foro\", \"the man stands in/at the marketplace\", replacing the \"est\" (from \"esse\") with \"stat\" (from \"stare\"), because \"standing\" was what was perceived as what the man was actually doing. \n\nThe use of \"stare\" in this case was still semantically transparent assuming that it meant \"to stand\", but soon the shift from \"esse\" to \"stare\" became more widespread. In the Iberian peninsula \"esse\" ended up only denoting natural qualities that would not change, while \"stare\" was applied to transient qualities and location. In Italian, \"stare\" is used mainly for location, transitory state of health (\"sta male\" 's/he is ill' but \"è gracile\" 's/he is puny') and, as in Spanish, for the eminently transient quality implied in a verb's progressive form, such as \"sto scrivendo\" to express 'I am writing'. \n\nThe historical development of the \"stare\" + gerund progressive in those Romance languages that have it seems to have been a passage from a usage such as \"sto pensando\" 'I stand/stay (here) thinking', in which the \"stare\" form carries the full semantic load of 'stand, stay' to grammaticalization of the construction as expression of progressive aspect (Similar in concept to the English verbal construction of \"I am still thinking\"). The process of reanalysis that took place over time bleached the semantics of \"stare\" so that when used in combination with the gerund the form became solely a grammatical marker of subject and tense (e.g. \"sto\" = subject first person singular, present; \"stavo\" = subject first person singular, past), no longer a lexical verb with the semantics of 'stand' (not unlike the auxiliary in compound tenses that once meant 'have, possess', but is now semantically empty: \"j'ai écrit\", ho scritto\", he escrito\", etc.). Whereas \"sto scappando\" would once have been semantically strange at best (?'I stay escaping'), once grammaticalization was achieved, collocation with a verb of inherent mobility was no longer contradictory, and \"sto scappando\" could and did become the normal way to express 'I am escaping'. (Although it might be objected that in sentences like Spanish \"la catedral está en la ciudad\", \"the cathedral is in the city\" this is also unlikely to change, but all locations are expressed through \"estar\" in Spanish, as this usage originally conveyed the sense of \"the cathedral \"stands\" in the city\").\n\nClassical Latin in most cases adopted an SOV word order in ordinary prose, however other word orders were allowed, such as in poetry, due to its inflectional nature.\nHowever, word order in the modern Romance languages generally adopted a standard SVO word order. This change may have been attributed from the Germanic peoples' influence in the late Imperial period, since they spoke in the SVO word order, or perhaps SVO was the ordinary Roman's way of speaking with SOV being considered more formal. \nFragments of SOV word order still survive through object pronouns (te amo – \"I love you\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
