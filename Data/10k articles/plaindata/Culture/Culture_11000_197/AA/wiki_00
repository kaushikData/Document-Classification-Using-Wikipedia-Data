The film was produced by Ánima Estudios and Porchlight Entertainment. The film was directed by José Alejandro García Muñoz.\n\nAlthough it was described as a \"television movie\", there is currently no further information about the film's air date or network.\n\nA Martian boy, Kip, was caught up in an intergalactic race to save both Christmas and Earth.\n\n\nOn 6 October 2008, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" reported that \"A Martian Christmas\" is in development from Porchlight Entertainment and Ánima Estudios. Post-production services was handled by Telegael.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews. IMDB reported the film received a 7.1 audience rating out of 10. Sierra Filucci of Common Sense Media gave this film 2 out of 5 stars and said, \"Unfortunately the build-up to the main part of the story -- the journey to Earth -- takes so long and is packed with so much backstory that kids and even adults might get lost, or just bored. Once the trip begins, things pick up and it's sort of interesting to see humans and Christmas from outsiders' eyes.\"\n\nThis film was released on DVD on 11 November 2009 by PorchLight Home Entertainment. Due to its obscurity, it remains one of the rarest films to this day, most likely due to lack of promotion, and the fact that this film was primarily produced in Mexico, as it is difficult for a Mexican animated production to get into the United States market, according to producer Fernando de Fuentes. The DVD of the film is only available on online shopping sites, such as eBay and Amazon.com.\n\n"}

Some excavation has been considered as a man-made over 100,000 years ago. After the Ice Age, area of Finland was resettled at around 9,000 years ago and first known sculpture Elk's Head of Huittinen (picture in stamp) has been dated about 5–7000 BCE.\n\nThe most important products of medieval architecture in Finland are the medieval stone churches. More than a hundred of them were built during 15th and 16th centuries. Neoclassical architecture arrived in late 18th century, but important building projects started after 1808 when Finland was an autonomic part of Russia. Alexander II of Russia commissioned Carl Ludvig Engel to plan the new Senate and University for Helsinki.\n\nThe Finnish academic drawing tradition began at Royal Academy of Turku in 1707 when first instructions of drawing was given. In 1824 The School moves with the University to Helsinki and first Finland’s art exhibition was organised at the Drawing School in the autumn of 1845. Painting was rising in Golden era of Finnish art in 1880s, when romantic nationalism was the spirit of art. Akseli Gallen-Kallela started in naturalism but moved to national romanticism.\n\nIn 1950s the Finnish artists looked for foreign influence: first in Paris, then in United States but also in Stockholm, where modern art exhibitions were organized in Moderna museet. Abstract art made its breakthrough first in concrete art. Early concretists included Birger Carlstedt and Sam Vanni. When Vanni's monumental painting \"Contrapunctus\" (1959) won competition for mural in Helsinki, abstract art was considered to be accepted and established in Finland.\n\nInformalism spread quickly in 1950s and 1960s, when it was considered a new approach to landscape painting. It was also building on strong tradition of expressionism. It spread even outside of large cities.\n\nThe Finnish contemporary art scene became much more visible than before with the establishment of Kiasma, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Helsinki in 1998.\n\n\n"}

The role of the teacher is therefore to provide feedback on students' performance as part of coaching them in the movements of the vocal tract articulators (tongue, jaw, lips, etc.) which create speech sounds.\n\nThe Articulatory approach is an alternative to the imitative-intuitive and analytic-linguistic approaches, both of which involve the teacher providing a model for her students to imitate. The model might be her own voice or a recording. In the articulatory approach, the students are not asked to match a model but instead to experiment with making sounds, with the teacher acting as a source of ideas, encouragement and feedback on how close the students are getting to the target.\n\nWhen learning a new language, students are not in a position to compare L1 and L2 sounds competently because the L2 sounds are evaluated using the categorical perception developed for L1. Trubetzkoy described the process as follows: \"The phonological system of a language is like a sieve through which everything that is said passes ... Each person acquires the system of his mother tongue. But when he hears another language spoken, he intuitively uses the familiar 'phonological sieve' of his mother tongue to analyze what has been said. However, since this sieve is not suited for the foreign language, numerous mistakes and misinterpretations are the result. The sounds of the foreign language receive an incorrect phonological interpretation since they are strained through the 'phonological sieve' of one's own mother tongue.\"\n\nUsers of the imitative-intuitive approach, who simply give their students a model to imitate ('Listen and Repeat') believe that this problem will resolve itself with exposure to L2 over the course of time. Users of the analytic-linguistic approach address the problem explicitly through listening exercises, recently including high variability phonetic training. In both approaches, it is believed that as students improve their perception of L2 sounds, they will be better able to match their production of L2 sounds to the models provided.\n\nProponents of the articulatory approach argue that it is more efficient to begin by working on the production of L2 sounds directly (as a motor skill rather than an imitative task) and that this leads to improved L2 perception.\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, Henry Sweet argued for the coaching of students in the use of their articulators: \"Those who try to learn new sounds by ear alone, without any systematic training in the use of their vocal organs, generally succeed only partially. ... In the case of those who have only an average ear, and still more of those who have a defective ear, organic training is indispensable. There can be no question that flexible organs well trained together with only an average ear, will yield better results than even an exceptionally good ear without organic training. Nor must it be forgotten that fineness of ear is not necessarily accompanied by flexibility of the vocal organs.\"\n\nSimilarly, the phonetician J. C. Catford presented readers with \"a series of simple introspective experiments [to be] carried out inside their own vocal tracts, their own throats and mouths. By actually making sounds (very often silently) and attending to the muscular sensations that accompany their production one can discover how they are produced ...\"\n\nCatford and Pisoni undertook a small scale experiment in which they found that students learnt both the pronunciation and discrimination of foreign sounds better when they were explicitly taught how to produce them than when they were taught how to discriminate them by ear.\n\nWithin foreign language teaching, the best known proponent of an articulatory approach was Caleb Gattegno. In his Silent Way, the teacher does not model sounds, but encourages experimentation on the part of students, and gives them feedback on how closely they are approaching their targets.\n\nThe work of Adrian Underhill, and Piers Messum & Roslyn Young are developments of Gattegno's work.\n"}

It is the sequel to 2012's \"The Avengers\" and 2015's \"\", and the nineteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, and features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Don Cheadle, Tom Holland, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright, Dave Bautista, Zoe Saldana, Josh Brolin, and Chris Pratt. In the film, the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy attempt to stop Thanos from amassing the all-powerful Infinity Stones.\n\nThe film was announced in October 2014 as \"Avengers: Infinity War – Part 1\". The Russo brothers came on board to direct in April 2015 and by May, Markus and McFeely had signed on to write the script for the film, which drew inspiration from Jim Starlin's 1991 \"The Infinity Gauntlet\" comic and Jonathan Hickman's 2013 \"Infinity\" comic. In 2016, Marvel shortened the title to \"Avengers: Infinity War\". Filming began in January 2017 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, with a large cast consisting mostly of actors reprising their roles from previous MCU films, including Brolin as Thanos. The production lasted until July 2017, shooting back-to-back with an untitled direct sequel. Additional filming took place in Scotland, England, the Downtown Atlanta area, and New York City. With an estimated budget in the range of $316–400 million, it is one of the most expensive films ever made.\n\n\"Avengers: Infinity War\" held its world premiere on April 23, 2018 in Los Angeles and was released in the United States on April 27, 2018, in IMAX and 3D. The film received praise for the performances of the cast (particularly Brolin's) and the emotional weight of the story, as well as the visual effects and action sequences. It was the fourth film and the first superhero film to gross over $2 billion worldwide, breaking numerous and becoming the highest-grossing film of 2018, as well as the fourth-highest-grossing film of all time and in the United States and Canada. The currently untitled sequel is set to be released on May 3, 2019.\n\nHaving acquired the Power Stone, one of the six Infinity Stones, from the planet Xandar, Thanos and his lieutenants—Ebony Maw, Cull Obsidian, Proxima Midnight, and Corvus Glaive—intercept a spaceship carrying the last survivors of Asgard. As they extract the Space Stone from the Tesseract, Thanos subdues Thor, overpowers Hulk, and kills Loki. Heimdall sends Hulk to Earth using the Bifröst before being killed. Thanos departs with his lieutenants and obliterates the ship.\n\nHulk crash-lands at the Sanctum Sanctorum in New York City, reverting to Bruce Banner. He warns Stephen Strange and Wong about Thanos' plan to kill half of all life in the universe; in response, Strange recruits Tony Stark. Maw and Obsidian arrive to retrieve the Time Stone from Strange, drawing the attention of Peter Parker. Maw captures Strange, but fails to take the Time Stone due to an enchantment. Stark and Parker pursue Maw's spaceship, Banner contacts Steve Rogers, and Wong stays behind to guard the Sanctum.\n\nIn Edinburgh, Midnight and Glaive ambush Wanda Maximoff and Vision in order to retrieve the Mind Stone in Vision's forehead. Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, and Sam Wilson rescue them and take shelter with James Rhodes and Banner at the Avengers Facility. Vision offers to sacrifice himself by having Maximoff destroy the Mind Stone to keep Thanos from retrieving it. Rogers suggests they travel to Wakanda, which he believes has the resources to remove the stone without destroying Vision.\n\nThe Guardians of the Galaxy respond to a distress call from the Asgardian ship and rescue Thor, who surmises Thanos seeks the Reality Stone, which is in the possession of the Collector on Knowhere. Rocket and Groot accompany Thor to Nidavellir, where they and Eitri create Stormbreaker, a battle-axe capable of killing Thanos. On Knowhere, Peter Quill, Gamora, Drax, and Mantis find Thanos with the Reality Stone already in his possession. Thanos kidnaps Gamora, his adopted daughter, who reveals the location of the Soul Stone to save her captive adopted sister Nebula from torture. Thanos and Gamora travel to Vormir, where Red Skull, keeper of the Soul Stone, informs him the stone can only be retrieved by sacrificing someone he loves. Thanos reluctantly kills Gamora, earning the stone.\n\nNebula escapes captivity and asks the remaining Guardians to meet her on Thanos' destroyed homeworld, Titan. Stark and Parker kill Maw and rescue Strange. Landing on Titan, they meet Quill, Drax, and Mantis. The group forms a plan to remove Thanos' Infinity Gauntlet after Strange uses the Time Stone to view millions of possible futures, seeing only one in which Thanos loses. Thanos arrives, justifying his plans as necessary to ensure the survival of a universe threatened by overpopulation. The group subdues him until Nebula deduces that Thanos has killed Gamora. Enraged, Quill attacks him, allowing Thanos to break the group's hold and overpower them. Stark is seriously wounded by Thanos, but is spared after Strange surrenders the Time Stone to Thanos.\n\nIn Wakanda, Rogers reunites with Bucky Barnes before Thanos' army invades. The Avengers, alongside T'Challa and the Wakandan forces, mount a defense while Shuri works to extract the Mind Stone from Vision. Banner, unable to transform into the Hulk, fights in Stark's Hulkbuster armor. Thor, Rocket, and Groot arrive to reinforce the Avengers; Midnight, Obsidian, and Glaive are killed and their army is routed. Thanos arrives and despite Maximoff's attempt to destroy the Mind Stone, removes it from Vision's head, killing him.\n\nThor severely wounds Thanos, but Thanos activates the completed Infinity Gauntlet and teleports away. Half of all life across the universe disintegrates, including Barnes, T'Challa, Groot, Maximoff, Wilson, Mantis, Drax, Quill, Strange, and Parker, as well as Maria Hill and Nick Fury, although Fury is able to transmit a signal first. Stark and Nebula remain on Titan while Banner, M'Baku, Okoye, Rhodes, Rocket, Rogers, Romanoff, and Thor are left on the Wakandan battlefield. Meanwhile, Thanos watches a sunrise on another planet.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, several other actors reprise their MCU roles: Danai Gurira as Okoye, the head of the Dora Milaje; Letitia Wright as T'Challa's sister Shuri; William Hurt as Thaddeus Ross, the U.S. Secretary of State; Kerry Condon as the voice of Stark's A.I. F.R.I.D.A.Y.; Winston Duke as M'Baku, the leader of Wakanda's mountain tribe the Jabari; Florence Kasumba as Ayo, a member of the Dora Milaje; Jacob Batalon as Parker's friend Ned; Isabella Amara as Parker's classmate Sally; Tiffany Espensen as Parker's classmate Cindy; and Ethan Dizon as Parker's classmate Tiny. Samuel L. Jackson and Cobie Smulders make uncredited cameos as Nick Fury and Maria Hill, the former director and deputy director of S.H.I.E.L.D, respectively, in the film's post-credits scene.\n\nThanos' henchmen, known collectively in the comics as the Black Order and in the film as the \"Children of Thanos\", include Terry Notary as Cull Obsidian, Tom Vaughan-Lawlor as Ebony Maw, Carrie Coon as Proxima Midnight, and Michael James Shaw as Corvus Glaive. The foursome provided voices and motion-capture performances on set for their characters. As Coon was pregnant during filming, she mainly did facial capture for Proxima Midnight with some motion-capture, with stuntwoman Monique Ganderton standing-in and providing the rest on set. Ebony Maw's look was inspired by the Marvel Comics character Mephisto, who appeared in the \"Infinity Gauntlet\" storyline.\n\nRoss Marquand portrays Johann Schmidt / Red Skull, the \"Stonekeeper\" and former Nazi commander of Hydra during World War II. Marquand replaces Hugo Weaving, who had expressed reluctance to reprise the character from \"\" (2011). Avengers co-creator Stan Lee makes a cameo appearance in the film as Parker's school bus driver, while screenwriter Stephen McFeely cameos as Secretary Ross's aide. Kenneth Branagh, the director of \"Thor\" (2011), voices an Asgardian distress caller in an uncredited cameo. David Cross was invited to make a cameo appearance as Tobias Fünke, his character from the television sitcom \"Arrested Development\", which the Russo brothers had previously worked on; this was prevented by a scheduling conflict, but Fünke still appears in the film as a specimen in the Collector's collection, played by an uncredited extra. Jon Favreau was to reprise his role as Happy Hogan, while co-director Joe Russo had a cameo appearance as a paparazzi photographer, but this scene did not make the theatrical cut of the film.\n\nIn October 2014, Marvel announced a two-part sequel to \"\" (2015), titled \"Avengers: Infinity War\". \"Part 1\" was scheduled to be released on May 4, 2018, with \"Part 2\" scheduled for May 3, 2019. In April 2015, Marvel announced that Anthony and Joe Russo would direct both parts of \"Avengers: Infinity War\", with back-to-back filming expected to begin in 2016. The next month, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely had signed on to write the screenplays for both parts of the film, which draws inspiration from Jim Starlin's 1991 \"The Infinity Gauntlet\" comic and Jonathan Hickman's 2013 \"Infinity\" comic. Anthony Russo added the film was inspired by 1990s heist films, with Thanos \"on a smash-and-grab [to acquire the Infinity Stones<nowiki>]</nowiki>, and everybody's trying to catch up the whole movie\". Producer Kevin Feige said that the \"Infinity War\" films were subtitled \"Part 1\" and \"Part 2\" \"because they [have] such shared elements, it felt appropriate... But I wouldn't call it one story that's cut in half. I would say it's going to be two distinct movies.\" In May 2016, the Russos revealed that they would retitle the two films, to further remove the misconception that they were one large film split in two, with Joe stating, \"The intention is we will change [the titles], we just haven't come up with [them] yet.\" That July, Marvel revealed \"Part 1\"s title would be shortened to simply \"Avengers: Infinity War\".\n\nPrincipal photography began on January 23, 2017, under the working title \"Mary Lou\", at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, with Trent Opaloch as director of photography. \"Infinity War\", along with its sequel, were shot using IMAX/Arri 2D cameras, thus marking the first time that a Hollywood feature film was shot entirely with IMAX digital cameras. In early February, Marvel confirmed the involvement of Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man, Chris Pratt as Peter Quill / Star-Lord, and Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man in the film. Additional filming took place in Scotland beginning in February 2017. The filming occurred in Edinburgh, Glasgow and the Scottish Highlands, with studio work taking place at Wardpark Studios in Cumbernauld. Filming also began at Durham Cathedral in Durham, England in early May 2017. In late June 2017, filming occurred in Downtown Atlanta, as well as Atlanta's Central Park in early July, before moving to Queens, New York in the middle of the month. Filming concluded on July 14, 2017. For the film's final scene, where Thanos emerges healed in a nipa hut, the filmmakers partnered with Indochina Productions, a studio based in Thailand, to acquire footage of the Banaue Rice Terraces at Ifugao, Philippines.\n\nLater in July 2017, Joe Russo stated there were a couple of unfinished scenes for \"Infinity War\" that would be shot \"in the next few months\". In early March 2018, Disney moved the release of \"Infinity War\" in the United States to April 27, 2018, to have it be released the same weekend as some of its international markets. Visual effects for the film were created by Industrial Light & Magic, Framestore, Method Studios, Weta Digital, Double Negative, Cinesite, Digital Domain, Rise, Lola VFX, and Perception. With an estimated budget in the range of $316–400 million, it is one of the most expensive films ever made. Evans and Hemsworth both earned $15 million for the film.\n\nIn June 2016, Alan Silvestri, who composed the score for \"The Avengers\" (2012), was revealed to be returning to score both \"Infinity War\" and its sequel. Silvestri started to record his score in January 2018, and concluded in late March. Silvestri felt working on the film \"was a really different experience than anything I'd done before, especially in regard to the approach and balancing quick shifts in tone\". Ludwig Göransson's theme from \"Black Panther\" is also used in the film. Hollywood Records and Marvel Music released the soundtrack album digitally on April 27, 2018, with a release on physical formats following on May 18. Two versions were released, a regular and deluxe edition, with the deluxe edition featuring some extended and additional tracks.\n\nIn May 2017, Robert Downey Jr. and his philanthropic organization Random Act Funding partnered with Omaze to initiate a contest to benefit the organization. A randomly chosen winner from those that donated would receive an \"Infinity War\" set visit. A life-sized statue of Thanos, created by Legacy Effects, was on display at D23 Expo 2017, alongside statues of the Black Order / \"Children of Thanos\": Corvus Glaive, Proxima Midnight, Ebony Maw, and Cull Obsidian. Additionally, Feige, Joe Russo, Downey, Brolin, Bettany, Olsen, Klementieff, Gillan, Bautista, Cheadle, Mackie, Cumberbatch, Stan, Holland, Boseman, Ruffalo, and Hemsworth appeared at D23 Expo to present a clip highlighting the 10 years of MCU films, along with footage from \"Infinity War\". The footage, which was screened exclusively for the panel, received strong audience reaction, with fans \"literally on their feet and jumping as the footage played\". Julia Alexander of \"Polygon\" commented, \"to say that there was quite a bit happening in the trailer would be one hell of an understatement.\" She was excited that the film would deliver on the character interactions in one film and that \"Infinity War\" \"finally feels like Marvel has made the movie it always wanted to—and the one we've always wanted to see. For nearly ten years we dreamt of this reality and to see it play across a massive screen... it was impossible to not feel emotional.\" CinemaBlend's Eric Eisenberg said the footage left him \"literally shaking\", with the film looking \"like it could be one of the most epic blockbusters ever created\", concluding \"the hype [for the film] most definitely feels very, very real\". Haleigh Foutch for Collider said, \"It looks dark and dramatic, and utterly epic. It's clear Marvel is trying to do something different here... to pay off a decade's worth of narrative and world-building. While it's impossible to tell from two minutes work of footage, it certainly looks like that gamble paid off.\" The D23 footage was also shown at the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con International. Due to the two convention presentations, \"Avengers: Infinity War\" generated over 90,000 new conversations on social media from July 17 to 23, the third-most during that time period behind \"Thor: Ragnarok\" and \"Justice League\" (2017), according to comScore and its PreAct service. \"Infinity War\" stayed in third the following week, with over 41,000 new social media conversations, behind \"Ragnarok\" and \"It\" (2017). By the week of October 16, \"Infinity War\" had generated over 679,000 total social media conversations.\n\nTo promote the release of the film's first trailer, Marvel released \"a retrospective video looking back at some of its best trailers\" since \"Iron Man\" (2008), \"paired with fan reaction videos to those trailers\". The first trailer for \"Avengers: Infinity War\" debuted on \"Good Morning America\" on November 29, 2017. Josh Spiegel of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" said, \"The trailer promises, in many ways, exactly what anyone with a passing familiarity with superhero movies would expect...\" but \"the most important part of the trailer is how it carefully, deliberately introduces the notion that the \"Infinity War\" films are going to function as a passing of the torch, from one set of Avengers to a newer group.\" Scott Mendelson, writing for \"Forbes\", noted that even though the trailer was not much different from the convention footage screened earlier in the year, it was \"damn impressive. Moreover, it uses Nick Fury's big 'Avengers Initiative' speech, along with Alan Silvestri's Avengers theme, to excellent effect.\" Conversely to Mendelson, Alexander commented on the different marketing strategy for the film between the convention footage scenes and the trailer scenes, feeling the \"two couldn't be more different\". She noted how the convention footage (\"meant to please a crowd running on little sleep and jittery with anticipation\") was released between \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\" (2017) and \"Thor: Ragnarok\", and \"[i]t made sense to use Thor and the Guardians to hype up [\"Infinity War\"]\" because \"Marvel relied on the anticipation of \"Thor: Ragnarok\" and \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\"s success to excite fans, and footage of older movies set to classic Marvel scores as a way to drive home how this movie is an event in itself.\" Conversely, the trailer (\"designed to explain what's about to happen, teasing it out with additional background\") heavily featured Black Panther and Wakanda, which Alexander said could not have been done earlier, without the additional marketing for \"Black Panther\" that happened after the conventions to provide additional context. Gael Cooper of CNET observed that the trailer was viewed nearly 500,000 times in its first 15 minutes after it was posted on YouTube, but questioned if the trailer broke the site after the view counter appeared to be stuck at 467,331. The trailer was viewed 230 million times in its first 24 hours, becoming the most viewed trailer in that time period, surpassing the record of \"It\".\n\nIn January 2018, Marvel Comics published a two-issue prequel comic titled \"Avengers: Infinity War Prelude\", which serves as a bridge between \"Captain America: Civil War\" and \"Avengers: Infinity War\". A commercial for \"Infinity War\" aired during Super Bowl LII. The ad generated the most social media buzz out of all the films advertised during the Super Bowl, according to comScore and United Talent Agency; it was viewed 17.6 million times across YouTube and Facebook. On February 27, 2018, Disney and Marvel announced the Marvel: The Universe Unites charity campaign leading to the release of merchandise for the film on March 3. The week-long event saw stars from the film create social media challenges to provide funds and raise awareness for charities that support children and families impacted by serious illness. If their collective posts reached 1 million likes, Marvel said they would make a $250,000 donation to Starlight Children's Foundation. Additionally, Disney planned to donate 10% of sales of all Marvel products purchased at Disney Stores in the United States and online on the weekend of March 3 to the Make-A-Wish Foundation, up to $50,000. Hasbro donated $1 million worth of cash and products to Give Kids the World Village and Funko made a $1 million toy donation to Starlight.\n\nA second trailer was released on March 16, 2018, which earned over 1 million views on YouTube in less than three hours after it was released. Alyssa Rosenberg of \"The Washington Post\" was not overly enthused about another superhero film having \"special-effects-heavy villains, or the sight of yet mysterious object hanging over the Manhattan skyline\", but felt the trailer made her realize \"that I'm actually looking forward to seeing [the characters of the MCU] get to know each other\". Spiegel agreed with Rosenberg about the potential for character interactions, noting the trailer \"suggests that some of these meetings are going to keep up the playful tone of recent MCU movies\". While conceding it was \"gimmicky\" to have so many \"crossover-style introductions or combinations of heroes in a movie like this\", he noted \"the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe is built on a foundation of these heroes existing within the same space, so their eventual meetings have a level of anticipation that exceeds that of watching them face off against Thanos.\" The second trailer was viewed 179 million times in the first 24 hours, the third-most viewed trailer in that time period, behind the first trailer for the film and \"It\", while also becoming the biggest release for a second trailer, surpassing \"Beauty and the Beast\" (2017) (128 million views).\n\nA week before the film's release, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai was lit up each night for the film, counting down to its release. Marvel also featured tie-in events across seven of their mobile games to promote the film. In early May 2018, Marvel and Epic Games announced the \"Infinity Gauntlet Limited Time Mashup\" mode for \"Fortnite Battle Royale\", where players could find the Infinity Gauntlet hidden on the game map and become Thanos with added abilities. The Russo brothers were fans of \"Fortnite\" and approached Donald Mustard, the worldwide creative director of Epic Games, about the potential for a crossover between the properties. On November 20, 2018, Little, Brown and Company published \"Marvel's Avengers: Infinity War: Thanos – Titan Consumed\", written by Barry Lyga. Despite not existing within Marvel Studios' MCU canon, the novel explores the origins of Thanos before the events of the film. Lyga noted he spoke with Marvel Studios to get an \"outline of who Thanos is and what he means to the movies\", and \"was given great latitude and a free hand [in some areas of the story], while in others I had to tip-toe very carefully through the MCU\".\n\nAdditional marketing partners for the film included Coca-Cola, Quicken Loans and their Rocket Mortgage service, the Infiniti QX50 (which is also featured in the film), Ziploc, Go-Gurt, Yoplait, Synchrony Bank, American Airlines, and Stand Up to Cancer. The partners created television commercials \"inspired by or featuring the film's characters and themes\", interactive digital initiatives, and robust in-store presences at numerous retailers. Duracell, Unilever, Quaker Oats Company, Chevron, and Samsung ran promotions in smaller markets. Coca-Cola, Ziploc, Go-Gurt, and Yoplait created special packaging in support of the film, with Synchrony implementing a \"Save Like a Hero\" campaign, and Stand Up to Cancer and American Airlines launching a national campaign with a PSA starring Johansson and Hemsworth. In the United Kingdom, OnePlus released an \"Infinity War\" edition for one of their smartphones. \"Deadline Hollywood\" estimated the media value was $150 million, the largest for any Marvel film, with Coca-Cola contributing an estimated $40 million.\n\n\"Avengers: Infinity War\" held its world premiere at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles on April 23, 2018, screening also at the adjacent El Capitan Theatre and Grauman's Chinese Theatre. It was released in most countries worldwide, including the United States, on April 27, 2018, with a few debuts beginning as early as April 25, and was shown in IMAX and 3D on select screens. In the United States, the film opened in 4,474 theaters, 408 of which were IMAX; this was the widest release for a Disney title ever and the second-widest ever after \"Despicable Me 3\"s 4,529 theaters. Three of AMC Theatres' locations screened the film for 24 hours straight, with 53 of their locations having showtimes at either 2 am or 3 am to accommodate demand. In India, the film had the biggest release ever for a Hollywood film, opening on nearly 2,000 screens in four languages. The film also screened in 515 4DX theaters in 59 countries. \"Avengers: Infinity War\" was originally scheduled to be released on May 4, 2018 in the United States. The Chinese release of the film, which opened on May 11, 2018, was originally scheduled to end on June 10, 2018, but was granted a \"rare\" extension of 30 days, to end on July 9, 2018.\n\nSelect footage from the film was screened around various cities during the film's press tour in early April, ahead of the film's Los Angeles premiere. The Russos noted that only a limited amount of the film would be shown at these screenings to reduce the chance of spoilers being leaked. Adam Chitwood of Collider commented that this was \"highly unusual as most Marvel movies are screened in their entirety for press about a month before they hit theaters\". Ahead of the United States release, AMC Theatres in New York City and Orlando, Florida aired an eleven-MCU film marathon beginning on April 25, leading to a screening of \"Infinity War\". The El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles also had a similar marathon ahead of the film's release.\n\n\"Avengers: Infinity War\" was released on digital download by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on July 31, 2018, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on August 14. The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, and a blooper reel. The digital release also features a roundtable discussion between MCU directors the Russos, Jon Favreau, Joss Whedon, James Gunn, Ryan Coogler, Peyton Reed, and Taika Waititi. In terms of home media sales, the physical versions of the film were collectively the top home media release of the week in which they were first released.\n\nDespite being shot with IMAX cameras and releasing in IMAX theaters in that aspect ratio, the IMAX version of the film was not released on the home media, instead including a cropped 2.39:1 aspect ratio. Joe Russo said they \"spent a long time trying to\" have the IMAX version on the home media, but since the IMAX Corporation has \"agency over that format\", the situation was \"complicated\". He did not rule out the possibility that this version could be available at a later point.\n\n\"Avengers: Infinity War\" grossed $678.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $1.368 billion in other territories, for a worldwide total of $2.047 billion. It became the fourth highest-grossing film of all time, as well as the highest-grossing film of 2018, the highest-grossing MCU film, and the highest-grossing superhero film.\n\nIts worldwide opening weekend of $640.5 million is the biggest of all time, beating \"The Fate of the Furious\" (2017) $541.9 million. It was the fastest film to make $1 billion at the worldwide box office, doing so in 11 days to eclipse \"\" (2015) record of 12 days. Also in its second weekend, \"Infinity War\" passed $13.5 million from 4DX screens, which was the all-time record for the format. On June 12, 2018, \"Avengers: Infinity War\" passed the $2 billion mark at the worldwide box office, becoming the fourth film to cross that milestone after \"Avatar\" (2009), \"Titanic\" (1997), and \"The Force Awakens\". Crossing the mark in 48 days was the second fastest to that point, after \"Avatar\"s 47-day record. With $140 million worldwide from IMAX, the film is the third-largest worldwide in the format, behind \"Avatar\" and \"The Force Awakens\", and the largest for a Marvel film. In May 2018, two weeks after its release, \"Deadline Hollywood\" deduced the film had already broken even and estimated its net profit would be around $600 million. This value took into account production budgets, P&A, talent participations, and other costs, with box office grosses and ancillary revenues from home media.\n\nIn December 2017, a survey from Fandango indicated that \"Infinity War\" was the most anticipated film of 2018. Fandango later reported that \"Infinity War\" achieved the largest initial 24-hour ticket pre-sales for a superhero film, taking just 6 hours to surpass the previous 24-hour record set by \"Black Panther\". Atom Tickets reported that \"Infinity War\" sold more tickets in its first pre-sales day than \"Black Panther\" sold in its first month. Within 72 hours, the film generated the largest pre-sales for any superhero film at AMC Theatres, with its advance ticket sales being 257.6% ahead of \"Black Panther\"s, 751.5% ahead of \"Captain America: Civil War\", and 1,106.5% ahead of \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" during the same time frame. Two weeks before its release, Fandango revealed that advance ticket sales for \"Infinity War\" were outpacing the last seven MCU films combined in the same timeframe, and had become the company's top April release. It was also on pace to become the top superhero film. A week before the film released, \"The Wall Street Journal\" said the film had sold more than $50 million worth of advance tickets, behind only \"The Force Awakens\" and \"\" (2017), with Fandango reporting that more than 2,500 showtimes had sold out. On Atom Tickets, \"Infinity War\" had the most pre-sale volume, selling 7% higher than \"The Last Jedi\" and 250% higher than \"Black Panther\" at the same point in their sales. Atom also reported that ticket sales for \"Infinity War\" were doubling daily the week of its release, the fastest rate of increase the service has seen for any MCU title.\n\n\"Avengers: Infinity War\" earned $106.7 million on its opening day in the United States and Canada (including $39 million from Thursday night previews), for an opening weekend total of $258.2 million. The Thursday night preview earning was the best for an MCU film (beating \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\"s $27.6 million) and the fourth-best of all time, behind \"The Force Awakens\" ($57 million), \"The Last Jedi\" ($45 million) and \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2\" (2011) ($43.5 million). Fandango reported that $14 million of the $39 million came from ticket pre-sales from the company. The opening day gross was the second-best ever, behind \"The Force Awakens\" $119.1 million; its Saturday gross of $83 million was the best-ever Saturday gross, beating \"Jurassic World\"s (2015) $69.6 million; and its Sunday gross of $69.2 million was the best-ever, beating \"The Force Awakens\" $60.5 million. The total weekend gross became the highest-grossing opening weekend, beating \"The Force Awakens\" $248 million. IMAX contributed $22.5 million to the opening weekend gross, which was the best opening for a Marvel film in the format and the third-biggest opening, behind \"The Force Awakens\" ($30 million) and \"The Last Jedi\" ($24.7 million). AMC reported that the film had the highest Friday and Saturday box office gross for a single title in the company's history, while Fandango reported that approximately $84 million worth of tickets were sold through the service, approximately 30%, which was the largest share of the weekend box office for any film in the company's history. \"Avengers: Infinity War\" earned an additional $25 million the Monday after its opening weekend, which was the highest grossing Monday in April, beating \"Furious 7\" (2015) ($14 million), and the second-best Monday gross for an MCU film, after \"Black Panther\" ($40.1 million). The next day, it earned $23.5 million, which was the highest grossing Tuesday for an MCU film, beating \"Black Panther\" ($20.8 million), and the highest grossing Tuesday in May, beating \"The Avengers\" ($17.6 million). It also tied \"The Force Awakens\" for the fastest to reach $300 million at five days.\n\nThe film remained number one in its second weekend, earning $115.5 million, which was the second-best second weekend ever after \"The Force Awakens\" ($149.2 million). \"Infinity War\" also surpassed $400 million in the weekend, doing so in nine days, becoming the second fastest film to reach that mark, again after \"The Force Awakens\"s eight days. In its third weekend, \"Infinity War\" remained number one at the box office, and became the second-fastest film to surpass $500 million, doing so in 15 days (behind \"The Force Awakens\"s 10 days). The weekend also saw its total domestic IMAX gross become $48.1 million, which was the highest for any MCU film. The film's fourth weekend saw it come in second, behind \"Deadpool 2\", and in its fifth it finished third behind \"\" and \"Deadpool 2\". By May 23, \"Infinity War\" surpassed $600 million, becoming the second-fastest film to do so in 26 days, after \"The Force Awakens\" (12 days). It remained in the top ten through its ninth weekend. In the United States and Canada, it went on to become the fourth highest-grossing film of all time, and the second highest-grossing superhero film, behind \"Black Panther\".\n\nOutside the United States and Canada, the film earned $382.7 million from 52 markets, opening number one in all, and became the number two opening internationally, behind \"The Fate of the Furious\" ($444.2 million). IMAX contributed $18.5 million, which was the best opening outside of the US, Canada, and China, surpassing \"The Force Awakens\" ($17.5 million).

Many other European countries and the Middle East also broke superhero film records. Japan had the second-biggest opening for an MCU film with $9 million, and Australia had the second-highest opening weekend ever, with $23.2 million.\n\n\"Avengers: Infinity War\" remained number one in its 54 markets in its second weekend. The $4.9 million opening day in Russia was the biggest of all time. \"Infinity War\" was also the first film in Russia to sell more than 1 million tickets in a single day, and went on to gross $17.6 million in the market, a new opening weekend record. IMAX contributed $2.2 million in the market, which was also an opening weekend record. In its third weekend, the film remained number one in a majority of its markets. \"Infinity War\" opened in China to $200 million (RMB 1.266 billion), which was the second highest opening weekend in local currency behind \"The Fate of the Furious\" ($184 million and RMB 1.352 million).

The film is the third highest-grossing film of all time in territories outside the United States and Canada.\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an 84% approval rating based on 397 reviews, and an average rating of 7.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"Avengers: Infinity War\" ably juggles a dizzying array of MCU heroes in the fight against their gravest threat yet, and the result is a thrilling, emotionally resonant blockbuster that (mostly) realizes its gargantuan ambitions.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 68 out of 100, based on 53 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it an 87% overall positive score and a 68% \"definite recommend\".\n\nTodd McCarthy of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" praised the writers' and directors' ability to balance the large cast of characters, saying, \"...writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely and directors Anthony and Joe Russo, under the supervision of Marvel Films maestro Kevin Feige, acknowledge the traffic jam of egos and play it for laughs\". Owen Gleiberman of \"Variety\" concurred, stating, \"\"Infinity War\" is a brashly entertaining jamboree, structured to show off each hero or heroine and give them just enough to do, and to update their mythologies without making it all feel like homework.\" \"Rolling Stone\"s Peter Travers said the film is \"too much of a good thing\" and wrote, \"The Russo brothers have clearly never learned the concept that less is more. They've used the premise of an Avengers reunion to put on a fireworks explosion of action and laughs that won't quit.\" Richard Roeper of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" called it Marvel's \"biggest and most ambitious movie yet\", but concluded \"it's certainly not the best. However, there's plenty of action, humor and heart—and some genuinely effective dramatic moments.\" Roeper went on to praise the film's cast and Josh Brolin in particular, whom he called \"the film's most interesting performance\". Gleiberman called Brolin's motion capture performance \"supremely effective\" and said, \"Brolin infuses Thanos with his slit-eyed manipulative glower, so that the evil in this movie never feels less than personal.\" McCarthy wrote, \"Brolin's calm, considered reading of the character bestows this conquering beast with an unexpectedly resonant emotional dimension, making him much more than a thick stick figure of a supervillain.\" McCarthy also praised the film's action sequences, saying \"\"Infinity War\" brims with tensely spectacular combat sequences, even if the question of who's going to win each one has that extravagantly arbitrary could-Mighty-Mouse-beat-up-Superman? quality.\" Gleiberman called the scale of the action, \"astonishing\", and Travers wrote, \"\"Avengers: Infinity War\" leaves viewers up in the air, feeling exhilarated and cheated at the same time, aching for a closure that never comes...at least not yet.\" Josh Spiegel, also of \"The Hollywood Reporter\", said the film takes \"a cue from the ending of \"The Empire Strikes Back\" in its super-sized finale; this is the equivalent of Han Solo frozen in the carbonite, on steroids.\"\n\nA. O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" criticized the film's reliance on other films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, saying, \"Considered on its own, as a single, nearly 2-hour-40-minute movie, \"Avengers: Infinity War\" makes very little sense\", but conceded that it \"was never meant to be viewed or judged in isolation\". Richard Brody of \"The New Yorker\" agreed, stating, \"The insubstantiality of the film isn't due to the infinite yet flimsy malleability of C.G.I. gimmickry but, instead, to the dispersion of its drama throughout the many cinematic installations set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\" Stephanie Zacharek of \"Time\" said, \"[It] isn't really a beginning, but more of a middle or an end with a new piece of yarn attached. You need to have seen and internalized every one of the previous 18 Marvel Cinematic Universe movies to fully get it.\" Justin Chang of the \"Los Angeles Times\" called it a \"brisk, propulsive, occasionally rousing and borderline-gutsy continuation of a saga that finally and sensibly seems to be drawing to a close\", but called its ultimate bid for catharsis \"unsuccessful\", saying, \"Not even the threat of universal annihilation, it seems, will keep this assembly line from chugging ahead with its signature polished, mechanized efficiency.\" Scott also criticized the action sequences, calling them \"tedious and predictable\" and writing, \"The noisy, bloated spectacles of combat were surely the most expensive parts of the movie, but the money seems less like an imaginative tool than a substitute for genuine imagination.\" Likewise, Zacharek said, \"There's no pacing in \"Avengers: Infinity War\". It's all sensation and no pulse. Everything is big, all of the time.\"\n\nAmerican YouTube personality Tony \"Nem\" Mitchell watched the film 103 times in theaters, a world record. When Mitchell's streak was gaining media awareness around his 44th viewing, he noted that IMAX reached out to give him 50 free tickets to continue the streak, and the Russo brothers invited him to the sequel's premiere. Mitchell said this was the way he \"want[ed] to support Marvel and the Russo brothers.\" Seventeen-year-old Kieran Harvey from Staffordshire also watched the film in theaters 100 times. Harvey stated that he \"didn't plan on seeing it this many times it just sort of happened\" adding that \"Infinity War\" \"just felt so different to anything I've ever seen before, and I just love it so much so have been going as much as I can!\"\n\nThe ending of the film sparked various Internet meme reactions, particularly one related to Spider-Man saying he does not feel good as he disintegrates, which was applied to other aspects of pop culture. The website, \"DidThanosKill.Me\" was created for fans to see if they would have been spared by Thanos or not. The ending also spawned the creation of the Reddit subreddit, /r/thanosdidnothingwrong. A user within the subreddit suggested that half of the approximately 20,000 subscribers at the time be banned from the subreddit, in order to mimic the events of the film. After the community agreed to the measure, the moderators approached Reddit's administrators to see if the mass ban would even be possible. Once the administrators agreed to the random ban of half the subscribers, it was set to occur on July 9, 2018. Notice of the impending ban made the subreddit's subscribers increase to over 700,000, including both of the Russos who subscribed. Ahead of the ban, Brolin posted a video saying \"Here we go, Reddit users,\" and ending it with a snap. Over 60,000 people watched a live Twitch stream of the ban occurring, which lasted a couple hours. The ban of over 300,000 accounts, which included Anthony Russo, was the largest in Reddit's history. Those banned then gathered in the new subreddit, /r/inthesoulstone. One Reddit user who participated felt the ban \"embodie[d] the spirit of the Internet\" with people \"banding together, en masse, around something relatively meaningless but somehow decidedly awesome and hilarious.\" Andrew Tigani of Screen Rant spoke of the ban and how /r/thanosdidnothingwrong \"only speaks to how impactful the film has already become to pop culture. It is also a testament to how valuable fan interaction can be via social media.\"\n\nAn untitled sequel is scheduled to be released on May 3, 2019, with the Russos returning to direct, and Markus and McFeely once again writing the screenplay.\n\n\n"}

This practice is neither new nor outdated and can be associated with religious beliefs, medication or as part of a regular diet. This act can expose the consumer to toxic substances and parasites found in the ingested earth.\n\nCalabash chalk is identified by different names such as: calabar stone (English), \"la craie\" or \"argile\" (French), \"mabele\" (Lingala in Congo), \"nzu\" (Igbo of Nigeria), \"ndom\" (Efik/Ibibio Nigeria) \"eko\" (Bini/Edo Nigeria). In addition it is also known as \"ebumba\", \"poto\" and \"ulo\". In Ghana it is known as \"shilè\".\n\nCalabash chalk is found predominantly in Nigeria and other West African communities. Although this geophagic material is native to Africa, as a result of migration of West African's to other nations, it can also be found in ethnic stores in the UK, Canada and the US. Calabash chalk is also eaten amongst women of African descent in the US state of Georgia.\n\nCalabash chalk is a naturally occurring material composed of fossilized sea shells. However it can also be prepared artificially by combining clay, sand, wood ash and even salt. By molding and heating this mixture, the calabash chalk is obtained. It is available as a powder, a molded shape or a block.\n\nThere are different views concerning the components of calabash chalk, the consensus being that the major component is aluminum silicate hydroxide. This comes from the kaolin clay group, making Al2Si2O5(OH)4 a possible formula for calabash chalk. Aside from aluminum silicate hydroxide, calabash chalk is also known to have very high concentrations of lead. The European Union recommends (Commission Regulation, 2001) the amount of lead in food should not exceed 1 mg/kg, however the amount of lead contained in calabash chalk has been reported (Codex Committee of Food Additives and Contaminants, 2003) to be between 10–50 mg/kg.\nIn addition, other reports of its composition include: aluminum, persistent organic pollutants, silicon, alpha lindane, endrin, endosulfan 11, arsenic, and chromium.\n\nThe practice of eating calabash chalk is observed by both sexes and different age groups of people of African descent, for the purpose of pleasure. However, it is prevalent among women, predominantly during pregnancy, who claim it prevents vomiting, over-salivation and nausea. Calabash chalk is also used to make facial masks and soaps.\n\nWhen geophagical materials are consumed and come in contact with digestive fluids, they have the potential of releasing clinical or sub-clinical toxic effects on an individual.\nThere are several reports regarding the health risks of consuming calabash chalk including; the alteration of the normal concentration of hemoglobin, red blood cell counts and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Another possible side effect of eating this geophagia is the alteration of growth rate and de-mineralization in the femur bone. Other reports suggest that calabash chalk also causes numerous gastrointestinal disorders such as nausea, ulcers and gastritis. This stems from histomorphological changes that calabash chalk causes to the stomach and oesophagus.\n"}

They are sometimes referred to as \"bodysuits\", especially in reference to a full-body suit worn by a man (although \"bodysuit\" usually refers to a legless garment); \"catsuit\" is typically used only in reference to women.\n\nThe catsuit has been identified as a film-maker's costume of choice for stealth. In films like \"Irma Vep\", \"Les Vampires\" and \"Heroic Trio\", crime and catsuits are featured together, as well as its major original use in Alfred Hitchcock's \"To Catch a Thief\".\n\nA trend of bodysuits was observed by film reviewer Alan Farrell in his book \"High Cheekbones, Pouty Lips, Tight Jeans\", and a number or occurrences of the garb in films were mentioned - Charlize Theron in \"Aeon Flux\", Milla Jovovich in the and film of the \"Resident Evil\" franchise, Carrie-Anne Moss in \"The Matrix\", Angelina Jolie in \"\", Kate Beckinsale in \"Underworld\", and Raquel Welch in \"Fantastic Voyage\". The trend of leather and vinyl catsuits were identified as an attempt to redefine the gender role of women through films. Theresa L.

The cat suits that adorn the feline hybrid characters in this genre are firstly illustrating their connection to felines. On the ideological level, the costumes signify the attributes that our society has projected onto cats and that the characters embody.\" In another post-modern thesis on sadomasochism in cinema Andrea Beckmann wrote, \"Cinematic SM is twisted into the non-consenting, violent realm of the unhinged that we know it is not. Fetishism is used as an excuse for a bit of titillatory semi-nudity, or to identify the villain – the man in black leather. Horror films, in particular, will happily throw in a leather catsuit or a gratuitous bondage scene to spice up a mediocre script (M Olley, \"Pam Hogg: Warrior queen of the catwalk\").\"\n\n"}

It premiered on HBO in July 2000.\n\nNew Secret Service agent Mike Connelly, assigned to protect President-elect Jack Cahill, becomes uneasy having to protect a person who is having an affair with a friend's wife. Connelly feels even worse about it after preventing an assassination attempt aboard Cahill's plane where a flight attendant is accidentally killed in the process. Sensing Connelly's discomfort around Cahill, his boss reassigns him to the team that protects the \"nuclear football\" as soon as Cahill becomes president.\n\nIn the film, the \"nuclear football\" briefcase contains a high-tech laptop computer, which can only be operated through a two key system (one key operated by the president and the other by the agent on \"football duty\") along with thumbprint and eye retina scans from the president.\n\nAfter the newly inaugurated president has been planning a meeting with Fung, the President of Taiwan to discuss the strained relationship between Taiwan and the People's Republic of China, one of the Secret Service agents returns home to find that his family is being held hostage by some men who are later revealed to be Fung's henchmen. They force him to participate in a plot to steal \"the football\". When President Cahill and President Fung are at Taiwan aboard Fung's ship, Fung insists that he feels that peaceful co-existence with mainland China may no longer be possible and that drastic action must be taken to ensure China does not invade Taiwan. Soon afterwards, Fung's henchmen begin killing all the other agents, leaving Mike Connelly as the only loyal Secret Service agent left.\n\nFung's men, along with Fung's girlfriend Iris, are successful in stealing the football, and Fung forces Cahill to activate it (by knocking him unconscious to get his thumbprint and eye retina scans), explaining that he will use the US's ICBMs to launch a nuclear strike on China, hoping that this will lead a revolution among his people towards \"a new beginning\" of Taiwanese freedom and pointing out that since he alone controls all of the US's missiles, he would not have to worry about mutually assured destruction of both China and the United States, just the United States when China retaliates.\n\nMeanwhile, Vice President Valdez is informed of the situation and Fung makes a phone call to her explaining that he has seized control of the United States' nuclear missiles and will launch one against Beijing unless both China and the United States within 24 hours recognize Taiwan's independence and that the United States promises to use its full military might against China if it tries to invade Taiwan. Valdez insists that this would never be possible and later Fung follows through with his threat, launching a first strike against Beijing using an ICBM from Nebraska.\n\nValdez first contacts the President of Russia to assure that the missile is not targeted towards Russia. Then Valdez contacts Chairman Tzu of China to explain the situation and that the United States did not launch the missile and is therefore not responsible. She also offers to give Tzu the chance to shoot the missile out of the sky but Tzu angrily points out that this would be impossible. It is then that he gives the order to launch a retaliatory strike against the United States using one of China's ICBMs, which he calls \"an eye for an eye\". True to his word, the missile is targeted for Washington, D.C.\n\nAfter Beijing and later Washington are destroyed, Tzu launches a second strike using several of China's missiles as further retaliation for the destruction of China's capital. Meanwhile, Iris is revealed to Agent Connelly to be an undercover Chinese agent whose assignment was to recover the football and return it to Beijing. But even she had no idea Fung would actually launch missiles against her country, and points out that China would no doubt retaliate against the US in response to the attack, thus she points out now they both have a common interest. Together they are able to escape Fung's ship and follow Fung and the still kidnapped President to Hong Kong. They are both ultimately successful in taking out all but one of Fung's henchmen. The last remaining one strangles Iris to death however and continues his search for Agent Connelly.\n\nMeanwhile, Connelly finds President Cahill held at gunpoint by Fung who still has the football. Fung along with Agent Thornton orders Connelly to surrender or else either Fung or Thornton will kill the President. It is then Cahill says for Connelly to \"remember your duty\". Fung at first thinks he means the duty of protecting the President, but then Connelly points out that he is on football duty and that it's \"some other guy's job\" to protect the President. Connelly shoots the President in the leg which shocks Fung and distracts him just long enough to allow Connelly to take him and Agent Thornton out. Connelly and President Cahill now are in control of the football and begin the process of deactivating it. The last of Fung's henchmen however, is able to fatally wound the President before Connelly can take him out. But not before President Cahill is successfully able to deactivate the football. By doing so, Vice President Valdez and NORAD have regained control of the United States' nuclear arsenal.\n\nValdez gives this news to Chairman Tzu and says that he may now order the destruction of his missiles. Tzu refuses, thinking Valdez is bluffing. Valdez then gives the order to NORAD that \"Stage One is a go\", which Tzu is horrified to find out is in fact a launch of several of the US' ICBMs. Valdez warns Tzu has one minute to destroy his missiles, and if he does, Valdez will destroy her missiles and points out to Tzu that he does not want to know what \"Stage Two\" is. Just when it seems all hope is lost however, Tzu complies with Valdez's instructions and destroys all his missiles which soon afterwards Valdez does the same with hers. Thus a major nuclear war was narrowly averted.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "194072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=194072", "title": "Collective action", "text": "Collective action\n\nCollective action refers to action taken together by a group of people whose goal is to enhance their status and achieve a common objective. It is a term that has formulations and theories in many areas of the social sciences including psychology, sociology, anthropology, political science and economics.\n\nResearchers Martijn van Zomeren, Tom Postmes, and Russell Spears conducted a meta-analysis of over 180 studies of collective action, in an attempt to integrate three dominant socio-psychological perspectives explaining antecedent conditions to this phenomenon – injustice, efficacy, and identity. In their resultant 2008 review article, an integrative Social Identity Model of Collective Action (SIMCA) was proposed which accounts for interrelationships among the three predictors as well as their predictive capacities for collective action. An important assumption of this approach is that people tend to respond to subjective states of disadvantage, which may or may not flow from objective physical and social reality.\n\nExamining collective action through perceived injustice was initially guided by relative deprivation theory (RDT). RDT focuses on a subjective state of unjust disadvantage, proposing that engaging in fraternal (group-based) social comparisons with others may result in feelings of relative deprivation that foster collective action. Group-based emotions resulting from perceived injustice, such as anger, are thought to motivate collective action in an attempt to rectify the state of unfair deprivation. The extent to which individuals respond to this deprivation involves several different factors and varies from extremely high to extremely low across different settings. Meta-analysis results confirm that effects of injustice causally predict collective action, highlighting the theoretical importance of this variable.\n\nMoving beyond RDT, scholars suggested that in addition to a sense of injustice, people must also have the objective, structural resources necessary to mobilize change through social protest. An important psychological development saw this research instead directed towards subjective expectations and beliefs that unified effort (collective action) is a viable option for achieving group-based goals – this is referred to as perceived collective efficacy. Empirically, collective efficacy is shown to causally affect collective action among a number of populations across varied contexts.\n\nSocial identity theory (SIT) suggests that people strive to achieve and maintain positive social identities associated with their group memberships. Where a group membership is disadvantaged (for example, low status), SIT implicates three variables in the evocation of collective action to improve conditions for the group – permeability of group boundaries, legitimacy of the intergroup structures, and the stability of these relationships. For example, when disadvantaged groups perceive intergroup status relationships as illegitimate and unstable, collective action is predicted to occur, in an attempt to change status structures for the betterment of the disadvantaged group.\n\nMeta-analysis results also confirm that social identity causally predicts collective action across a number of diverse contexts. Additionally, the integrated SIMCA affords another important role to social identity – that of a psychological bridge forming the collective base from which both collective efficacy and group injustice may be conceived.\n\nWhile there is sound empirical support for the causal importance of SIMCA’s key theoretical variables on collective action, more recent literature has addressed the issue of reverse causation, finding support for a related, yet distinct, encapsulation model of social identity in collective action (EMSICA). This model suggests that perceived group efficacy and perceived injustice provide the basis from which social identity emerges, highlighting an alternative causal pathway to collective action. Recent research has sought to integrate SIMCA with intergroup contact theory (see Cakal, Hewstone, Schwär, & Heath) and others have extended SIMCA through bridging morality research with the collective action literature (see van Zomeren, Postmes, & Spears for a review).\n\nThe economic theory of collective action is concerned with the provision of public goods (and other collective consumption) through the collaboration of two or more individuals, and the impact of externalities on group behavior. It is more commonly referred to as Public Choice. Mancur Olson's 1965 book \"The Logic of Collective Action: Public Goods and the Theory of Groups,\" is an important early analysis of the problems of public good cost.\n\nBesides economics, the theory has found many applications in political science, sociology, communication, anthropology and environmentalism.\n\nThe term collective action problem describes the situation in which multiple individuals would all benefit from a certain action, but has an associated cost making it implausible that any individual can or will undertake and solve it alone. The ideal solution is then to undertake this as a collective action, the cost of which is shared. Situations like this include the prisoner's dilemma, a collective action problem in which no communication is allowed, the free rider problem, and the tragedy of the commons, also known as the problem with open access. An allegorical metaphor often used to describe the problem is \"belling the cat\".\n\nSolutions to collective action problems include mutually binding agreements, government regulation, privatisation, and assurance contracts, also known as crowdacting.\n\nMancur Olson made the claim that individual rational choice leads to situations where individuals with more resources will carry a higher burden in the provision of the public good than poorer ones. Poorer individuals will usually have little choice but to opt for the free rider strategy, i.e., they will attempt to benefit from the public good without contributing to its provision. This may also encourage the under-production (inefficient production) of the public good.\n\nWhile public goods are often provided by governments, this is not always the case. Various institutional designs have been studied with the aim of reducing the collaborative failure. The best design for a given situation depends on the production costs, the utility function, and the collaborative effects, amongst other things. Here are only some examples:\n\nA joint-product model analyzes the collaborative effect of joining a private good to a public good. For example, a tax deduction (private good) can be tied to a donation to a charity (public good).\n\nIt can be shown that the provision of the public good increases when tied to the private good, as long as the private good is provided by a monopoly (otherwise the private good would be provided by competitors without the link to the public good).\n\nSome institutional design, e.g., intellectual property rights, can introduce an exclusion mechanism and turn a pure public good into an impure public good artificially.\n\nIf the costs of the exclusion mechanism are not higher than the gain from the collaboration, clubs can emerge. James M. Buchanan showed in his seminal paper that clubs can be an efficient alternative to government interventions.\n\nA nation can be seen as a club whose members are its citizens. Government would then be the manager of this club.\n\nIn some cases, theory shows that collaboration emerges spontaneously in smaller groups rather than in large ones (see e.g. Dunbar's number). This explains why labor unions or charities often have a federated structure.\n\nSince the late 20th century, analytic philosophers have been exploring the nature of collective action in the sense of acting together, as when people paint a house together, go for a walk together, or together execute a pass play. These particular examples have been central for three of the philosophers who have made well known contributions to this literature: Michael Bratman, Margaret Gilbert, and John Searle, respectively.\n\nIn and subsequent articles and book chapters including Gilbert (2006, chapter 7) Gilbert argues for an account of collective action according to which this rests on a special kind of interpersonal commitment, what Gilbert calls a \"joint commitment\". A joint commitment in Gilbert's sense is not a matter of a set of personal commitments independently created by each of the participants, as when each makes a personal decision to do something. Rather, it is a single commitment to whose creation each participant makes a contribution. Thus suppose that one person says \"Shall we go for a walk?\" and the other says \"Yes, let's\". Gilbert proposes that as a result of this exchange the parties are jointly committed to go for a walk, and thereby obligated to one another to act as if they were parts of a single person taking a walk. Joint commitments can be created less explicitly and through processes that are more extended in time. One merit of a joint commitment account of collective action, in Gilbert's view, is that it explains the fact that those who are out on a walk together, for instance, understand that each of them is in a position to demand corrective action of the other if he or she acts in ways that affect negatively the completion of their walk. In she discusses the pertinence of joint commitment to collective actions in the sense of the theory of rational choice.\n\nIn Searle (1990) Searle argues that what lies at the heart of a collective action is the presence in the mind of each participant of a \"we-intention\". Searle does not give an account of we-intentions or, as he also puts it, \"collective intentionality\", but insists that they are distinct from the \"I-intentions\" that animate the actions of persons acting alone.\n\nIn Bratman (1993) Bratman proposed that, roughly, two people \"share an intention\" to paint a house together when each intends that the house is painted by virtue of the activity of each, and also intends that it is so painted by virtue of the intention of each that it is so painted. That these conditions obtain must also be \"common knowledge\" between the participants.\n\nDiscussion in this area continues to expand, and has influenced discussions in other disciplines including anthropology, developmental psychology, and economics. One general question is whether it is necessary to think in terms that go beyond the personal intentions of individual human beings properly to characterize what it is to act together. Bratman's account does not go beyond such personal intentions. Gilbert's account, with its invocation of joint commitment, does go beyond them. Searle's account does also, with its invocation of collective intentionality. The question of whether and how one must account for the existence of mutual obligations when there is a collective intention is another of the issues in this area of inquiry.\n\nIn addition to the psychological mechanisms of collective action as explained by the social identity model, researchers have developed sociological models of why collective action exists and have studied under what conditions collective action emerges. Along this social dimension, a special case of the general collective action problem is one of collective agreement: how does a group of agents (humans, animals, robots, etc.) reach consensus about a decision or belief in the absence of central organization? Common examples can be found from domains as diverse as biology (flocking, shoaling and schooling, and general collective animal behavior), economics (stock market bubbles), and sociology (social conventions and norms) among others.\n\nConsensus is distinct from the collective action problem in that there often is not an explicit goal, benefit, or cost of action but rather it concerns itself with a social equilibrium of the individuals involved (and their beliefs). And it can be considered spontaneous when it emerges without the presence of a centralized institution among self-interested individuals.\n\nSpontaneous consensus can be considered along 4 dimensions involving the social structure of the individuals participating (local versus global) in the consensus as well as the processes (competitive vs cooperative) involved in reaching consensus:\n\n\nThe underlying processes of spontaneous consensus can be viewed either as \"cooperation\" among individuals trying to coordinate themselves through their interactions or as \"competition\" between the alternatives or choices to be decided upon. Depending on the dynamics of the individuals involved as well as the context of the alternatives considered for consensus, the process can be wholly cooperative, wholly competitive, or a mix of the two.\n\nThe distinction between local and global consensus can be viewed in terms of the social structure underlying the network of individuals participating in the consensus making process. \"Local consensus\" occurs when there is agreement between groups of neighboring nodes while \"global consensus\" refers to the state in which most of the population has reached an agreement. How and why consensus is reached is dependent on both the structure of the social network of individuals as well as the presence (or lack) of centralized institutions.\n\nThere are many mechanisms (social and psychological) that have been identified to underlie the consensus making process. They have been used to both explain the emergence of spontaneous consensus and understand how to facilitate an equilibrium between individuals and can be grouped according to their role in the process.\n\n\nDue to the interdisciplinary nature of both the mechanisms as well as the applications of spontaneous consensus, a variety of techniques have been developed to study the emergence and evolution of spontaneous cooperation. Two of the most widely used are game theory and social network analysis.\n\nTraditionally game theory has been used to study zero-sum games but has been extended to many different types of games. Relevant to the study of spontaneous consensus are cooperative and non-cooperative games. Since a consensus must be reached without the presence of any external authoritative institution for it to be considered \"spontaneous\", non-cooperative games and nash equilibrium have been the dominant paradigm for which to study its emergence.\n\nIn the context of non-cooperative games, a consensus is a formal nash equilibrium that all players tend towards through self-enforcing alliances or agreements.\n\nAn alternative approach to studying the emergence of spontaneous consensus—that avoids many of the unnatural or overly constrained assumptions of game theoretic models—is the use of network based methods and social network analysis (SNA). These SNA models are theoretically grounded in the communication mechanism of facilitating consensus and describe its emergence through the information propagation processes of the network (behavioral contagion). Through the spread of influence (and ideas) between agents participating in the consensus, local and global consensus can emerge if the agents in the network achieve a shared equilibrium state. Leveraging this model of consensus, researchers have shown that local peer influence can be used to reach a global consensus and cooperation across the entire network. While this model of consensus and cooperation has been shown to be successful in certain contexts, research suggest that communication and social influence cannot be fully captured by simple contagion models and as such a pure contagion based model of consensus may have limits.\n\n\n"}

Young artists would study the latest trends and integrate them into their own work. Many strove to bring a native cultural identity into their art, for example themes of national history and legends, and some of the artwork following the First World War contained a strong political message against the ruling Austro-Hungarian state. A change was noticeable in 1919 with a move to flatter forms, and signs of cubism and expressionism were evident. In the 1920s, the Earth Group sought to reflect reality and social issues in their art, a movement that also saw the development of naive art. By the 1930s there was a return to more simple, classical styles.\n\nFollowing the Second World War, artists everywhere were searching for meaning and identity, leading to abstract expressionism in the U.S. and art informel in Europe. In the new Yugoslavia, the communist socialist realism style never took hold, but bauhaus ideas led to geometric abstraction in paintings and simplified spaces in architecture. In the 1960s, non-conventional forms of visual expression took hold along with a more analytical approach to art, and a move towards new media, such as photography, video, computer art, performance art and installations, focusing more on the artists' process. Art of the 1970s was more conceptual, figurative and expressionist. However, the 1980s brought a return to more traditional painting and images.\n\nThe term Modern Art in Europe covers roughly the period from the 1860s to the Second World War, and denotes a move away from academic art with its classical mythology themes and stylised landscapes. In Croatia, the change was marked by the Croatia salon (\"Hrvatski salon\") exhibit of 1898 in the new Art Pavilion in Zagreb. One of the prime movers of that exhibition, and in the construction of the Art Pavilion itself was the artist Vlaho Bukovac. Together with Bela Čikoš Sesija, Oton Iveković, Ivan Tišov, Robert Frangeš-Mihanović, Rudolf Valdec and Robert Auer he established a breakaway Croatian Society of Artists, who were to become known as the Zagreb Colourful School (\"Zagrebačka šarena škola\").\n\nThis set the scene in the beginning years of the 20th century, for young Croatian artists studying in Munich and Vienna, bringing back the ideas of the new Secessionist movements. Impressionism and post-Impressionism ideas spreading from Paris would also influence the new generation of artists. In sculpture and in painting, new ideas of individual artistic expression were taking hold, leading to a new direction of art in Croatia.\n\nThe Academy of Fine Arts in Zagreb was established in 1907, teaching a new generation of Croatian artists modern techniques and ideas.\n\nMunich Circle (\"Münchenski krug\") is the term given by art historians to a group of Croatian painters at the beginning of the 20th century at the start of Croatian Modernism. The painters were Josip Račić, Miroslav Kraljević, Vladimir Becić, and Oskar Herman. Together they attended the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, and were at the time known by their classmates as \"Die Kroatische Schule\" (The Croatian School). Račić and Herman had previously studied with Anton Ažbe at his famous private school in Munich, who insisted on studying the model, plasticity and drawing clear, clean volumes. The Munich painters achieved strong tonal forms in their work by studying the classical painting of Spanish and French masters. Their joint identity of style, with concise artistic expression, without literary, historical or moralistic framework, puts them in direct contact with French impressionism, particularly with Manet and Cézanne as role models. Each of them separately has influenced Croatian Modernism, and together they form an important category in Croatian art. The term \"Munich Circle\" was coined in the 1950s.\n\nIn 1908, a breakaway group of young Dalmatian artists in Split, founded the Medulić Society. Led by the artist Emanuel Vidović, they used themes from national legends, poetry and history in their art. Exhibitions were held in Split (1908), Ljubljana (1909), Zagreb (1910), Rome (1911), Belgrade (1912) and Split (1919). The Medulić group had an ideological orientation and an underlying political message. Its aim was not simply to develop a national artistic style, but rather to increase political awareness of the south Slavic identity, and promote the idea of independence from Austria-Hungary.\n\nThe Medulić Society's best known representative was the sculptor Ivan Meštrović, who by then was already receiving international recognition for his work. Within Croatia, his best known work includes the powerful “Well of Life”, and statues of Grgur Ninski, and Bishop Strossmayer. Other sculptors in the group include Toma Rosandić, Ivo Kerdić (best known for medallions), and Branislav Dešković (known for animal sculptures). Painters in the group included Mirko Rački best known for his powerful illustrations of Dante and his posters, Tomislav Krizman and Jerolim Miše.\n\nTwo strong images from the time are \"The Austro-Hungarian Monarchy\" by Mirko Rački (1916) and \"Black Flag\" by Ljubo Babić (1919), both portraying the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian state. Rački used the secessionist decorative style in a powerful statement: a soldier stands to attention against an empty grey field, while behind him sways a black and yellow snake (the colours of the Austrian flag). In Babic's painting, the subject is the funeral of Emperor Francis Joseph portrayed with a large elongated black flag hanging like a guillotine over a company of people dressed in gay, sumptuous colours.\n\nDuring 1916-28, the Spring salon exhibits in Zagreb brought together painters, sculptures and graphical artists. At the first exhibit in the Ulrich Gallery (1916), artists included Ljubo Babić, Jerolim Miše, Tomislav Krizman, Zlatko Šulentić, and sculptors Ferdo Ćus, Hinko Juhn and Joza Turkalj. During the First World War, many artists went abroad, and the salon became the only organized art-related activity at the time. The paintings exhibited showed strong use of form, and restricted colour palettes. The move to flatter forms, in the manner of Cézanne, came in the 1919 Spring Salon exhibition, with the next generation of artists such as the Prague Four (\"Praška četvorka\") Vilko Gecan, Milivoj Uzelac, Marijan Trepše, and Vladimir Varlaj. Expressionism, cubism and secessionism ideas spread, and new directions also came from Đuro Tiljak who had studied with Kandinsky, while Marino Tartaglia bought back the ideas of the Futurists from Rome and Florence. By the 1920s, elements of neoclassicism were creeping in, with its simpler forms.\n\nThe incoming ideas from the rest of Europe were balanced by artists who wanted to integrate the new artistic directions with their native cultural identity. The journal Zenit (Zenith), was an avant-garde review of new arts and culture that played a key role in this movement. Founded in 1921 by the poet and critic Ljubomir Micić, despite criticism and controversy, Zenit continued for 6 years to promote the cause for international modernism consistent with a Yugoslav cultural identity.\n\nOne of contributors to Zenit was the architect and artist Josip Seissel, who under the pseudonym of Jo Klek is considered to be the first in Croatia (1922) to produce abstract paintings: geometric collages with linguistic motifs and Surrealist compositions.\n\nBy the 1930s, the sculptor Ivan Meštrović, whose work was by then well-known internationally, moved into Classicism and encouraged a new \"Mediterranean tradition\" in his students' art.\nOther artists of time were Sergej Glumac and Vinko Foretić Sculptor Frano Kršinić created motifs of motherhood and music in marble, while Marin Studin created large works in wood, bronze and stone. Cubist influences can be found in works of Vlado Gecan, Sonja Kovačević Taljević, and surrealism in the works of Krsto Hegedušić, Vanja Radauš, and Anto Motika. On the island of Brač, Ignjat Job painted colourful landscapes in a personal Expressionist style.\n\nNaïve, or primitive art is a distinct segment of the art of the 20th century. In Croatia, naïve art was at first connected with the works of peasants and working men, ordinary men and women, of whom the most successful, over the course of time, became professional artists. Naïve art assumes the work of artists who are more or less self-taught, painters and sculptors with no formal art training, but who have achieved their own creative style and a high level of art. An identifiably individual style and poetic nature distinguishes the Naïve from other \"amateur\" painters and sculptors, and from the general self-taught artist. The view of a Naïve artist will usually display unusual proportions and perspective, and certain illogicalities of form and space. Such characteristics are the expression of a free creative imagination, in a similar way to other 20th-century art movements such as Symbolism, Expressionism, Cubism, and Surrealism.\n\nIn Croatia, Naïve art is also seen as a democratic movement, as the movement proves anyone can create worthwhile art regardless of formal training. Within these art forms various the emotive qualities of works are often more visible than any reigning form of logic or reason. Common themes include: \"the joy of life,\" \"forgotten nature,\" \"lost childhood,\" and \"wonder at the world.\" However, Naïve art does not only reflect positive aspects of life, and dark and tragic themes can also be found within the genre.\n\nNaïve art first appeared in Croatia at the beginning of the 1930s when the Zagreb Art Pavilion showcased an exhibition of the artists' association entitled Country (\"Zemlja\") on 13 September 1931. Of the artists exhibited, two particularly stood out: Ivan Generalić, who showed three drawings and nine watercolors, and Franjo Mraz, who exhibited three watercolors. The artists sought to show that talent does not only reside in certain social classes or privilege and started the association with naïve art and paintings of villages or by artists from the countryside rather than cities. Themes in Croatian naïve art branched out in the 1950s from villages to \"personal classics,\" which included architectural monuments and objects and opened a period known as \"modern primitive art.\"\n\nThe Earth Group (\"Grupa Zemlja\") were Croatian artists, architects and intellectuals active in Zagreb from 1929 to 1935. The group was Marxist in orientation and was partly modelled on \"Neue Sachlichkeit\", leading to more stylized forms, and the emergence of Naive painting. The group included the painters Krsto Hegedušić, Edo Kovačević, Omer Mujadžić, Kamilo Ružička, Ivan Tabaković, and Oton Postružnik, the sculptors Antun Augustinčić, Frano Kršinić, and the architect Drago Ibler. The Earth group searched for answers to social issues. Their program emphasised the importance of independent creative expression, and opposed the uncritical copying of foreign styles. Rather than producing art for art's sake, they felt it ought to reflect the reality of life and the needs of the modern community. Activities at the group's exhibitions were increasingly provocative to the government of the day, and in 1935 the group was banned.\n\nThe Hlebine School is the term applied to a group of naive painters working in or around the village of Hlebine, near the Hungarian border, from about 1930. The school developed from the encouragement given by Krsto Hegedušić to the young painter Ivan Generalić, whom he met in 1930. Generalić and his friends Franjo Mraz (also a native of Hlebine) and Mirko Virius (from the nearby village of Đelekovec) formed the nucleus of the group. In 1931, they were invited to exhibit with the Earth group, which brought public recognition and naive art became a popular form of artistic expression in Croatia, making a strong social statement about the harshness of rural life. Generalić was the first master of the Hlebine School, and the first to develop a distinctive personal style, achieving a high standard in his art.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the next generation of Hlebine painters tended to focus more on stylized depictions of country life taken from imagination. Generalić continued to be the dominant figure, and encouraged younger artists, including his son Josip Generalić. By the 1950s the school had become well-known internationally, and showed their work at leading exhibitions such as the São Paulo Art Biennial in 1955. The Croatian Museum of Naive Art in Zagreb has a comprehensive display of the works of the Hlebine School and other naive artists.\n\nSome of the best known naive artists are Dragan Gaži, Ivan Generalić, Josip Generalić, Krsto Hegedušić, Mijo Kovačić, Ivan Lacković-Croata, Franjo Mraz, Ivan Večenaj and Mirko Virius.\n\nDuring the Second World War, many artists left the country, while others joined the partisans and worked on applied art such as posters and prints supporting the war effort. In the years immediately following the war, the new communist regime in Yugoslavia brought in the Soviet model of socialist realism and refusal to participate in exhibitions became a popular means of resistance among artists. However, after Tito's break with Stalin and the Soviet Union in 1948 there was a return to more artistic freedom.\n\nIdentifying the characteristics of contemporary or postmodern art within Croatia can be hard to specify. Some common features are geometrizing and symbolic-metaphoric paintings, sculptures and installations. Some of the best known contemporary artists are painters Julije Knifer, Edo Murtić, Oton Gliha, and sculptor Ivan Kožarić.\n\nEXAT 51 (the name stands for \"Experimental Atelier\") was a group of artists and architects (1951–56) whose program was geometric abstraction in painting, new ways of handling of space in architecture, and the abolition of the distinction between fine and applied arts. Their ideas owed much to the Russian Constructivist avant-garde and the German Bauhaus experience, and Exat wanted to involve artists in the shaping of the environment with an experimental and creative approach. Members of the group included architects Bernardo Bernardi, Zdravko Bregovac, Zvonimir Radić, Božidar Rašica, Vjenceslav Richter, Vladimir Zarahović, and painters Vlado Kristl, Ivan Picelj, Božidar Rašica, and Aleksandar Srnec.\n\nExat's first manifesto in 1951 was fiercely attacked by the traditional art establishment. However, an exhibit of paintings by the group in 1952 in Zagreb was well attended, and in that same year, they participated in the VII Salon des Réalités Nouvelles in Paris. In 1953, an exhibition of paintings was held in the Society of Croatian Architects and there the group issued a second manifesto in response to their critics. Other exhibits followed in Belgrade (1953), Rijeka (1954,1956), Dubrovnik (1956) and finally in Belgrade (1956). Under their influence, Croatian artists moved to more creative and personal forms of expression, to surrealism and lyrical abstraction.\n\nEXAT 51 was instrumental in setting up the Zagreb Triennial of Applied Arts, and in establishing a Studio for Industrial Design in 1955. The forerunner of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Zagreb was founded in 1954 as a direct result of their efforts.\n\nGorgona was a group of artists active in Zagreb between 1959 and 1966, that advocated non-conventional forms of visual art expression. It included the painters Josip Vaništa, Julije Knifer, Marijan Jevšovar, Đuro Seder, sculptor Ivan Kožarić, art theoreticians and critics Radoslav Putar, Matko Meštrović, Dimitrije Bašičević (Mangelos), and architect Miljenko Horvat. Individually they were significant representatives of their own artistic fields, and together they had a major impact on the direction of contemporary art in Croatia. Besides working in more traditional techniques, they pioneered radical forms of artistic expression related to existentialism, neo-dadaism and proto-conceptualism. Their anti-magazine Gorgona (11 issues published 1961-1966) was simply designed, each edition intended to showcase the work and views of a single artist and was in itself a printed work of art. The group was preoccupied by the absurd, sent people invitations for events that never took place, placed ads for the sale of trivial objects, planned unfeasible projects, and even went so far as to exclude the audience to have the whole place for themselves. The Gorgona publication, and the group's activities raised interest in international art circles - and they had frequent contact with such artists as Dieter Roth, Victor Vasarely, Piero Manzoni, Lucio Fontana and Robert Rauschenberg.\n\nDuring the period 1961-1973, five international exhibitions were organized under the title New Tendencies. They continued the development of ideas raised by Exat 51 during the 1950s, and formed part of the broader European post-informel art movement in the 1960s and 70s. They were the initiative of art historians and critics Dimitrije Bašičević, Božo Bek, Boris Kelemen, Radoslav Putar, Matko Meštrović and the artists Ivan Picelj, Vjenceslav Richter, Julije Knifer, Aleksandar Srnec, later by a group of younger artists: Juraj Dobrović, Miroslav Šutej, Mladen Galić, Ljerka Šibenik and Ante Kuduz.\n\nThe exhibitions focused mainly on neo-Constructivism, presenting artistic achievements in a wide variety of media, such as computer graphics, conceptual art, performance art and environmental art, as well as an examination of the theory and practice of connecting art with society. The exhibitions were held in a number of museums and galleries across Zagreb presenting the latest work from internationally known artists.\n\nAt the first exhibition in 1961, a common theme was the investigation of the relationship between structure and surface, and the beginnings of programmed and kinetic art, a topic that was to be developed further in the following exhibition of 1963. Experiments in visual perception gave a scientific dimension, and by the third exhibition in 1965, artists were examining the relations between cybernetics and art, and events included a symposium on the topic. The 1968/69 exhibition and colloquium dealt further with ideas of information theory and aesthetics, called \"Computers & Visual Research\". Two new sections appeared at the exhibition of 1973 - one on conceptual art, and another entitled \"Canvas\". There was also a symposium on \"The Rational and the Irrational in Contemporary Art\". A 6th New Tendencies exhibition was planned, but never took place. An international symposium was held in 1978, along with an exhibit reviewing the artistic changes of 1966-1978.\n\nAmong the most significant works are the sculptures of Vojin Bakić, the reliefs, paintings and graphic books of Juraj Dobrović, and the paintings, sculptures, and mobile graphics of Miroslav Šutej.\n\nBetween the years 1966 and 1974, the visual arts scene in Croatia expanded, as in the rest of the world, to include new media art. Minimal art, Pop-art and the geometric forms of New Tendencies combined in a new generation of artists characterized by the free spirit of 1968 and ideas about changing the world. They used mass media as a means to express their individual observations and views. Within Croatia, the movement was known as \"new art practice\", stressing the importance of the artist's part in the process. The very notion of art was called into question, along with its function. Analyzing the concepts of culture, society, politics and economics led to new media as forms of expression such as photography, video, performance art, spatial interventions, and installation art. The works were most frequently conceptual or environmental, and emphasis shifted from aesthetic to ethical principles. By the mid-seventies disillusionment had set in, groups broke up, and some artists left the country.\n\nAmong the artists who made most impression in the \"new art practice\" with individual exhibitions or group actions and urban interventions were Željko Borčić, Boris Bućan, Vlasta Delimar, Slavomir Drinković, Braco Dimitrijević, Ladislav Galeta, Tomislav Gotovac, Sanja Iveković, Dean Jokanović, Jagoda Kaloper, Željko Kipke, Dalibor Martinis, Marijan Molnar, Goran Petercol, Ante Rašić, Josip Stošić, Davor Tomičić, Goran Trbuljak, Gorki Žuvela, the Group of Six Artists (Vlado Martek, Željko Jerman, Boris Demur, Mladen Stilinović, Sven Stilinović, Fedor Vučemilović), and the Group Flow (Vladimir Gudac, Dubravko Budić, Davor Lončarić, Ivan Šimunović, Gustav Zechel, Darko Zubčević).\n\nBiafra (1970–1978) was a group of Croatian artists that rebelled against the artistic, social and cultural conventions of the day, and engaged with real problems through their art. Individual members ranged in style from pop-art and minimalism to new figuration. The sculptors of the group used new materials in their work, such as polyester, plastic, jute, aluminum, and glass wool, while the painters engaged with imaginative, expressive, rich colors. The content of their art was expressionist, clear and direct. Exhibitions and activities were organized on the streets, presenting their ideas directly to the public. The group originally consisted of the young sculptors Branko Bunić, Stjepan Gračan, Ratko Petrić and Miro Vuco. Membership expanded over the years to include Ivan Lesiak, Zlatko Kauzlarić Atač, Rudolf Labaš, Vlado Jakelić, Stanko Jančić, Ratko Janjić-Jobo, Đurđica Zanoški-Gudlin, Emil Robert Tanay.\n\nAt the Art Pavilion in 1981, the Youth Salon showed the work of 12 young painters who presented a return to painting and images. The trend became known as New Image (\"Nova Slika\"), and it was also evident at the Gallery of Contemporary Art's exhibition of 'Italian Trans-Avantgarde', showing the works of Italian and Yugoslav artists. New image brought new ways of expression and a new sensitivity towards intimacy and symbolism. The traces of new image can be found in the late 1970s in Zagreb, and in major exhibitions in New York, London, the Venice Biennale (1980), the Biennale of young people in Paris 1980. Individual artists: Nina Ivančić, Star Fio, Đuro Seder\n\nThe 1980s brought a rejection of restrictions, and more varied individual approaches to art and explorations of painting and sculpture appeared. Some concentrated on the meaning and content of the work, while for others the narrative was more important and in conceptual art the medium increasingly defined the work. The avant-garde trends of the previous decades were giving way to a reintroduction of more traditional media in a more personal style, but at the same time, there was a more refined sense of conceptualism - leading to more materialized forms.\n\nSeveral of the older Croatian artists had already turned again towards painting and more traditional media during the 1970s. For example, the work of Ferdinand Kulmer and Đuro Seder brought significant changes to Croatian painting, and the sculptor Ivan Kožarić reviewed his work in relation to his artistic past. At the same time Dimitrije Bašičević organized the \"Confrontations\" exhibition which juxtaposed avant-garde and traditional approaches to art and compared their value and significance.\n\nThe 1990s was again a time of war, as Croatia gained its independence from the former Yugoslavia. Edo Murtić's \"War\" cycle stands as powerful, poignant statement, while his large scale paintings of near abstract landscapes, such as his \"Montraker\" cycle of the 1990s point the way to the future.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Roughly 20,000 are native Caymanian, with the remainder born elsewhere in the world.\n\nIn the past, most of the people of the Cayman Islands got their livelihood from the sea through fishing, turtle harvesting, and as merchant seamen. Cayman Sea Salt and Cayman Logwood products are now locally made and exported.\n\nThe influences of American and European culture are most evident in the religion of the Cayman Islands, where Christianity is the most practiced religion. Within the island group, Christian denominations include Anglican, Baptist, Catholicism, Church of God, Presbyterian, and United Church, among others. Because religion is an important aspect of the culture of the Cayman Islands, most of the local businesses as well as the harbors and ports are closed on Sundays. The same establishments are closed on Christmas days. The Cayman Islands also hosts a growing Jewish community.\n\nBritish English is the most commonly spoken language in the Cayman Islands, albeit with a distinctive Caymanian dialect. Jamaican patois is also commonly spoken in the Cayman Islands, and younger Caymanian generations had adopted certain Jamaican terms and expressions. \n\nThe food of the Cayman Islands includes traditional Afro-Caribbean fare such as cassava, johnny cake, bread fruit, plantain, and meat pie. Jamaican cuisine has also been an influence in the Cayman Islands, and jerk seasoning has become popular for use on meat dishes such as chicken, fish and pork. Curry is also used frequently in rice, chicken, and fish dishes. Traditional Caymanian fare includes dishes made from turtle meat, conch, goat, and fish such as grouper and snapper, with locally made Cayman Sea Salt.\n\n"}

{"id": "569398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=569398", "title": "Fanfare", "text": "Fanfare\n\nA fanfare (or fanfarade or flourish) is a short musical flourish that is typically played by trumpets or other brass instruments, often accompanied by percussion . It is a \"brief improvised introduction to an instrumental performance\" . A fanfare has also been defined as \"a musical announcement played on brass instruments before the arrival of an important person\", such as heralding the entrance of a monarch . Historically, fanfares were usually played by trumpet players, as the trumpet was associated with royalty . Bugles are also mentioned . The melody notes of a fanfare are often based around the major triad, often using \"[h]eroic dotted rhythms\" .\n\nBy extension, the term may also designate a short, prominent passage for brass instruments in an orchestral composition. Fanfares are widely used in opera orchestral parts, notably in Wagner's \"Tannhauser\" and \"Lohengrin\" and in Beethoven's \"Fidelio\". In \"Fidelio\", the dramatic use of the fanfare is heightened by having the trumpet player perform offstage, which creates a muted effect.\n\nThe word has been traced to a 15th-century Spanish root, \"fanfa\" (\"vaunting\"). Though the word may be onomatopoeic, it is also possible that it is derived from the Arabic word \"anfár\" (\"trumpets\"). The word is first found in 1546 in French, and in English in 1605, but it was not until the 19th century that it acquired its present meaning of a brief ceremonial flourish for brass . Indeed, an alternative term for the fanfare is \"flourish\", as in the \"Ruffles and Flourishes\" played by military bands in the US to announce the arrival of the President, a general, or other high-ranking dignitary . \"In the England of Shakespeare's time\", fanfares \"were often known as flourishes and sometimes as \"tuckets\" (a word related to toccata) .\n\nIn French usage, \"fanfare\" also may refer to a hunting signal (given either on \"starting\" a stag, or after the kill when the hounds are given their share of the animal). In both France and Italy, \"fanfare\" was the name given in the 19th century to a military or civilian brass band . In French, this usage continues to the present, and distinguishes the all-brass band from bands of mixed brass and woodwind, which is called \"Harmonie\" . Fanfares have been imitated in art music as early as the 14th century. Examples in opera include a fanfare for the governor's arrival in Beethoven's \"Fidelio\", act 2. In the 20th century, well-known composed fanfares include Aaron Copland's \"Fanfare for the Common Man\" (1942), for brass and percussion, and Igor Stravinsky's \"Fanfare for a New Theatre\" (1964), for two trumpets (; ).\n\nCopland's Fanfare is one of a series of 18 commissioned by Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra conductor Eugene Goossens in 1942–43, each to open a concert. Each was to salute an aspect of the war effort; the U.S. had entered World War II the previous year. The only one of these fanfares to become well known is Copland's; the others are rarely if ever performed or recorded.

Today, gaiters for walking are commonly made of plasticized synthetic cloth such as polyester. Gaiters for use on horseback continue to be made of leather.\n\nIn army parlance, a gaiter covers leg and bootlacing; a legging covers only the leg. In RAF parlance, gaiter includes legging. The American Army during World War I and World War II had leggings, which were gaiters. Above the knee spatterdashes were cotton or canvas, as were many gaiters of varying lengths thereafter. Leather gaiters were rare in military, though sometimes a calf-length cotton gaiter had leather kneecaps added. Leggings, however, were very often made of leather, but also canvas.\n\nGaiters are a type of protective clothing for a person's ankles and legs below the knee. Gaiters are worn when walking, hiking, running (especially orienteering and rogaining) outdoors amongst dense underbrush or in snow, with or without snowshoes. Heavy gaiters are often worn when using crampons, to protect the leg and ankle from the spikes of the opposite foot. Gaiters strap over the hiking boot and around the person's leg to provide protection from branches and thorns and to prevent mud, snow, etc. from entering the top of the boot. Gaiters may also be worn as protection against snake bites.\n\nGaiters are similar to puttees, a part of numerous military uniforms. Gaiters known as \"jambieres\" (derived from the French word \"jambe\" for legs, hence leggings) were part of the uniform of Zouave infantry regiments.\n\nDuring the 19th century gaiters for riding typically were known as \"riding gaiters\", distinguishing them from the other gaiters that were in general use. Today, half chaps are a type of gaiter worn by equestrians. Most forms fit over the calf. These are intended to protect the rider's leg from wear by the stirrup leathers and other saddle parts. Modern styles usually have a zipper or hook and loop fasteners on the outside of the leg.\n\nGaiters formed a part of the everyday clerical clothing of bishops and archdeacons of the Church of England until the middle part of the twentieth century. They were also worn by some cathedral deans. They were made of black cotton, wool, or silk, and buttoned up the sides, reaching to just below the knee where they would join with black breeches. Gaiters would be worn with a clerical apron, a type of short cassock reaching to just above the knee. The purpose of this vesture was originally practical, since archdeacons and bishops were presumed to be mobile, riding horses to various parts of a diocese or archdeaconry. In latter years, the clothing took on a more symbolic dimension.\n\n\n"}

The agency he worked for, a high-tech government think tank called Intersect (\"International Security Techniques\"), found a way to return him to visibility and control his new power by the use of a special wristwatch referred to as a \"DNA stabilizer,\" which was invented by scientist Abby Lawrence (Katherine Crawford).

Richard Dysart played Casey's boss, Leonard Driscoll, in the pilot and William Sylvester played Driscoll during the series.\n\n\nThe two-hour pilot episode of the series, \"The Gemini Man\" (aka \"Code Name: Minus One\"), originally aired on May 10, 1976.\n\n\nTwo episodes, \"Smithereens\" and the unaired \"Buffalo Bill Rides Again\", were re-edited into one 90-minute television movie titled \"Riding With Death\", which was released in 1981.\n\n\"Riding with Death\" used scenes from \"\" as establishing shots for sweeping computer room scenes. The \"Guardian\" logo (\"Guardian\" was the Russian version of \"Colossus\") appears in at least one segment. Though not immediately verifiable, at least one segment uses the \"Colossus\" speaker/microphone.\n\nThe film dealt clumsily with the dropping of Katherine Crawford from the cast by the latter episode, the length of time between filming (William Sylvester had grown a thick bushy mustache in the interim), and the appearance of an arch-villain in the second \"half\" who did not exist in the opening of the series (save for a clumsy overdub referring to the villain's elusiveness in the final minutes of the first segment). Both parts feature singer Jim Stafford as a trucker named \"Buffalo Bill\" who befriends and helps Sam.\n\nIn 1997, \"Riding With Death\" was featured in an episode of movie-mocking television show \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\". Mike Nelson and his robot friends highlighted the thin connection between the two halves of the \"movie\", and the general incoherence of the plot.\n\nThe complete TV series was released as a region-free DVD in the French territory in November 2013 by Elephant Films with two language tracks, French and English. The episodes are uncut.\n\n"}

{"id": "20983202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20983202", "title": "Hebraization of surnames", "text": "Hebraization of surnames\n\nThe Hebraization of surnames (also Hebraicization) (, \"Ivrut\", \"Hebraization\") is the act of adopting a Hebrew surname in exchange for their diaspora names. For many diaspora Jews who migrated to the Land of Israel, taking a Hebrew surname was a way to erase remnants of their diaspora experience and to assimilate into a new shared identity as Mizrahi Jews and Palestinian Jews (Jewish residents of Ottoman Palestine and Mandatory Palestine) and later as Israeli Jews (Jewish citizens of the independent State of Israel.)\n\nThis name-change typically did not apply to Mizrahi Jews who came from neighboring countries such as Iran, Iraq, and Egypt. Mizrahis usually kept their surnames.\n\nThis phenomenon was especially common among Ashkenazi Jews, because many such families only acquired permanent surnames (rather than patronyms) when surnames were made compulsory by the November 12, 1787 decree by the Habsburg emperor Joseph II. By way of contrast, Sephardi Jews from the Iberian peninsula often had hereditary family names since well before the Spanish Expulsion (e.g., Cordovero, Abrabanel, Shaltiel, de Leon, Alcalai, Toledano...) Very few Hebrew surnames existed before Hebraization, such as \"Cohen\" (priest), \"Moss\" (Moses) and \"Levi\" (Levite). In America, names ending with \"-berg\", \"-stein\" or \"-man\" are often thought of as Jewish, but are of German origin, while suffixes such as \"-sky\" and \"-vitz\" are Slavic. Similarly, a few Hebrew surnames, such as \"Katz\", \"Bogoraz\", \"Ohl\" and \"Pak\" are in fact Hebrew acronyms, even though they sound and are often perceived as being of foreign origin (in these cases, from German, Russian, Polish and Korean, respectively).\n\nThe Hebraization of surnames is a unique phenomenon to the Hebrew language. This process began as early as the days of the First and Second \"Aliyot\" and continued after the establishment of the State of Israel. The widespread trend towards Hebraization of surnames in the days of the Yishuv and immediately after the establishment of the State of Israel was based on the claim that a Hebrew name provided a feeling of belonging to the new state. There was also the wish to distance from the lost and dead past, and from the forced imposition of foreign (e.g. German) names in the previous centuries.\n\nThis process has not ended: among the thousands of Israelis who currently apply for legal name changes each year, many do it to adopt Hebrew names.\n\nAmong the Yishuv (the first to return to Eretz Yisrael—the Land of Israel), there was a strong feeling of \"sh'lilat ha'gola\" (Hebrew: \"negation of the diaspora/Exile\"), which often included the exchange of Diaspora surnames for purely Hebrew ones. Part of the Zionist movement was not only Aliyah it was also wanting to create an image of an Israeli Jew that would be different than the Yiddish speaking, \"shtetl\" living, and perceived weak Diaspora Jews, and these things were a significant part of the people of the First and Second \"Aliyot\". Some of the immigrants of the First Aliyah (1882–1903) Hebraized their surnames, and the practice became widespread during the Second Aliyah (1904–1914). \n\nThis process started with individuals like Eliezer Ben-Yehuda (Perelman) and was adopted by the New Yishuv. Before the founding of the State of Israel, in 1944, the Zionist leadership and the Jewish National Council proclaimed it the \"Year of naturalization and the Hebrew name\". A special committee under the chairmanship of Mordechai Nemzabi, the Jewish Agency advisor on matters of civilian defense, published a booklet which contained guidelines on the creation on new Hebrew surnames.\n\n\nAfter the Israeli Declaration of Independence, there was still the attitude that the hebraization of family names should continue, in order to get rid of names with a diaspora sound. Hebraization of names became a typical part of the integration process for new immigrants among Ashkenazi Jews, but also among Sephardi and Mizrahi Jewish immigrants from Arab and Muslim lands; Sephardi and Mizrahi children were typically given new Hebrew names in school, often without permission from their parents.\n\nDavid Ben-Gurion, the first Prime Minister of Israel, was committed to the use of the Hebrew language (he changed his surname from Grün to Ben-Gurion). He tried to convince as many people to change their surnames into \"real\" Hebrew ones. Ben-Gurion got Herzl Rosenblum to sign the Israeli Declaration of Independence as Herzl Vardi, his pen name (later changed to his legal name), as Ben-Gurion wanted more Hebrew names on the document. Nine more of the signatories of the document would then go on to Hebraize their name, as well.\n\nBen-Gurion, in an order to the Israel Defense Forces soldiers, wrote, \"It is desirable that every commanding officer (from Squadron Commander to Chief of Staff) should change his surname, whether German, English, Slavic, French or foreign in general, to a Hebrew surname, in order to be a role model for his soldiers. The Israel Defense Forces must be Hebrew in spirit, vision, and in all internal and external expressions.\"\n\nA binding order of the same issue was issued to the officials of the state in 1950, and particularly to those who represented the State abroad. A \"Committee for Hebrew Names\" was established to supervise the implementation of the order, whose task was to assist and advise the choice of a Hebrew name.\n\nIn addition to pressure from the state, tensions between Jewish ethnic groups caused some people to Hebraize their names to dis-identify with a \"stigmatized\" ethnic group or to merge into a \"collective Israeli identity\" and therefore created a desire to Hebraize.\n\nThe Hebraization of surnames provoked sharp controversy in the days of the Yishuv and also after the establishment of the State of Israel.\n\nAmong the most significant supporters was Yitzhak Ben Zvi (Shimshelevich), leader of the Labor movement, historian and second President of the State of Israel. He was born in Ukraine on 24 November 1884. He studied law in Istanbul together with David Ben Gurion. In 1906 he attended the founding conference of the Poalei Zion and in 1907 he settled in the Land of Israel. He belonged to the founders of the Ahdut ha-Avodah Party, was active in the Haganah, a member of the Jewish National Council, and signed the Israeli Declaration of Independence. Ben Zvi died in 1963.\n\nBen Zvi wrote:\nAll rabbinic authorities encourage hebraizing first names (VaYikra Rabba 32, and Kor'ei Sh'mo, pp. 173–181), and some actively encourage last names, as well (Rabbi Shlomo Aviner (Resp. She'elat Shlomo VIII, 67-68), and even did so themselves: among them: Rabbis Menashe HaKatan (Klein), Maharam Schick, Shlomo Goren (Goronchick), Shaul Yisraeli (Israelite), Moshe Zvi Neria (Menkin), Shlomo Aviner (Langenauer).\n\nOne of the opponents of the Hebraization of surnames was Moses Calvary, a writer and teacher. Born in Germany 1883, he received a traditional, general, and rabbinical education. He was a member of Ahdut Ha'avodah, an educator in the Meir Shafia youth village, principal of the Hebrew Gymnasium (High School) in Jerusalem, and educator in the \"Ahava\" youth village in Kiryat Bialik.\n\nSome people were emotionally attached to their diaspora last name, for reasons such as it having noble origins (Hebrew: יִחוּס \"Yichus\"), or for a desire to continue to identify with their ethnic group. There is story of an Israeli diplomat who told David Ben-Gurion, \"I will change my name if you can find me one non-Jew named Lifshitz.\" Others had names that were entirely Hebrew to begin with.\n\nThe disagreement about the Hebraization of surnames continued. Many people preserved their foreign surname, such as first President of Israel Chaim Weizmann, President of the Supreme Court of Israel Shimon Agranat, and others.\n\nThis trend moderated with time. By the time of the wave of immigration from the former Soviet Union in the 1990s, the practice was waning. The Soviet immigration wave clearly had the effect of weakening the practice of Hebraizing names—as part of the marked general tendency of these immigrants to cling to their specific Russian linguistic and cultural identity. A conspicuous example is the former (2009–2013) Israeli Minister of Tourism, Stas Misezhnikov. Though an outspoken Israeli nationalist on other issues, Misezhnikov did not feel impelled to change his clearly Slavic surname (nor his equally Slavic first name), and there was no public pressure on him to do so—as there would have been on an Israeli minister during the country's first decades.\n\nHowever, even today, people continue to Hebraize their surname, especially those serving in the IDF and Israel's diplomatic missions, representing the State of Israel. The number of those who do is small but significant; about 15% of American and British immigrants to Israel who come on Nefesh B'Nefesh flights Hebraize their names on arrival.\n\nThere is also a trend of reverting to ancestral, non-Hebrew names to return to one's roots and preserve traditions unique to each ethnic group. There are people who re-adopt the name their family previously abandoned for the sake of \"Israeliness\", such as Israeli writer Yitzhak Orpaz who restored his family's original family name of \"Averbuch\".\n\nThere were several ways people Hebraized their names.\n\nSome names were words that were directly translated from the corresponding Diaspora name.\n\nOthers were direct translations of patronymic names or names based off biblical figures.\nOther names were translated from toponyms.\nOther names were the negation of so-called \"Ekelnamen\" (literally \"Disgusting names\" in German, deliberately insulting or demeaning last names forced upon ancestors by non-Jewish officials).\nOther names were Hebraized on their similar sounding to a Hebrew word or name, though sometimes their phonetic similarity was far-fetched.\nSometimes, there were prevalent options between either translating it, or choosing a name based on similar sound (homophone).\nIn some cases, a false cognate could satisfy both options at once.\nOthers chose completely newly chosen names, many times symbolic in nature.\nOthers kept their name for several reasons. Sometimes, the reason it was kept was because of its religious nature. For examples, names connected with the Kohen (priesthood) such as Cohen, Kohn, Kaplan, Sacerdoti, Katz, Azoulai, etc. Other times it indicated Levite descent such as Levi, Levy, Weil (anagram), and Segal (Hebrew acronym). Other times it was synagogue or Jewish community functions such as Gabbai, Chazan, or Rabin. Sometimes the surname was already Hebrew (Sarfati).\n\nOthers kept their name for its \"yichus\",(meaning that the person descends from something akin to \"good stock\") which gave the bearer more reason not to Hebraize it. For example, Horowitz (famous rabbinical dynasty), Rothschild (famous Jewish banking dynasty), Einstein (famous bearer), or Shaltiel (ancient Sephardic family tracing its origins to King David—and it is already Hebrew).\n\nOthers kept their name but the name underwent some mutation because they contained sounds that do not exist in Hebrew. Examples include Lando (from \"Landau\"), and Glober (from \"Glauber\").\n\nOther \"Diaspora\" Jewish names are Hebrew to begin with (such as Ashkenazi and Yerushalmi), corruptions of Hebrew words (such as Heifetz (from Chafetz)), Hebrew acronyms (such as Shalit (from \"\"Sheyihye le'orekh yamim tovim\")), or of Aramaic origin (such as Kahane, or Raban).\n\n"}
{"id": "52466311", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52466311", "title": "Impacts of tourism", "text": "Impacts of tourism\n\nThe study of the effect that tourism has on environment and communities involved is relatively new. Impacts are not easily categorized, having direct and indirect components. Also tourism is often seasonal, and impacts only become apparent after time, with varying effects, and at different stages of development. There are three main categories.\n1. Environmental impacts: impacts that affect the carrying capacity of the area, vegetation, air quality, bodies of water, the water table, wildlife, and natural phenomena.\n2. Sociocultural impacts: associated with interactions between peoples and culture background, attitudes and behaviors, and their relationships to material goods. The introduction of tourists to sensitive areas can be detrimental, cause a loss of culture, or, alternatively, contribute to the preservation of culture and cultural sites through increased resources.\n\n3. Economic impacts: usually seen as positive, contributing to employment, better services, and social stability. Also it may improve in terms of cultural education which one may have not considered. Yet these impacts can also contribute to high living costs within the community, pushing local business out of the areas, and raising costs for locals \n\nEcotourism, nature tourism, wildlife tourism, and adventure tourism take place in environments such as rain forests, high alpine, wilderness, lakes and rivers, coastlines and marine environments, as well as rural villages and coastline resorts. Peoples' desire for more authentic and challenging experiences results in their destinations becoming more remote, to the few remaining pristine and natural environments left on the planet. The positive impact of this can be an increased awareness of environmental stewardship. The negative impact can be a destruction of the very experience that people are seeking. There are direct and indirect impacts, immediate and long-term impacts, and there are impacts that are both proximal and distal to the tourist destination. These impacts can be separated into three categories: facility impacts, tourist activities, and the transit effect.\n\nFacility impacts occur when a regional area evolves from \"exploration\" to \"involvement\" and then into the \"development\" stage of the tourist area life cycle. During the latter phase there can be both direct and indirect environmental impacts through the construction of superstructure such as hotels, restaurants, and shops, and infrastructure such as roads and power supply. As the destination develops, more tourists seek out the experience. Their impacts increase accordingly. The requirement for water for washing, waste disposal, and drinking increases. Rivers can be altered, excessively extracted, and polluted by the demands of tourists. Noise pollution has the capacity to disturb wildlife and alter behavior, and light pollution can disrupt the feeding and reproductive behaviour of many creatures. When power is supplied by diesel or gasoline generators there is additional noise and pollution. General waste and garbage are also a result of the facilities. As more tourists arrive there is an increase in food and beverages consumed, which in turn creates waste plastic and non-biodegradable products.\n\nFor many tourists the main reason for their vacation is to engage in various types of physical activities, and enjoy interacting with nature in a way that they would not ordinarily be able to do. These activities, such as hiking, trekking, kayaking, bird watching, wildlife safaris, surfing, snorkelling, and scuba-diving all affect the local ecology.\nThere are a range of impacts from hiking, trekking, and camping that directly affect the activity area. The most obvious is the erosion and compaction of the trail itself. The daily use of the trail by hikers the trail wears the trail down and compacts it. If there are any obstacles such as fallen trees or puddles of mud, then the trail becomes widened or informal trails are created to bypass the obstacle. There are a number of other direct impacts on the treaded area, such as damage or removal of vegetation, loss of vegetation height, reduction in foliage cover, exposure of tree root systems, migration of trampled vegetation, and introduction of non-native species.\n\nAs well as the direct impacts, there are indirect impacts on the trails, such as a change in soil porosity, changes to microflora composition, problems with seed dispersion and germination, and degradation of soil nutrient composition. As many hikers and trekkers take multi-day trips, a large number will camp overnight either in formal or random campgrounds. There are similar impacts on campgrounds such as soil compaction, erosion and composition, loss of vegetation and foliage, plus the additional issues of campfires for cooking and warmth. Informal trails are created around the campsite in order to collect firewood and water, and trees and saplings can be trampled, damaged, or cut-down for fuel. The heat of campfires may damage tree-root systems. In formal campgrounds, tent pad areas are normally devoid of any vegetation while random camping can damage sensitive plants and grasses during a single overnight stay.\n\nAs with most recreation activities, including hiking and camping, there will be waste generated, food scraps, and human waste. This can cause human-wildlife interactions, such as the habituation of wildlife to human contact and unusual food sources. This can have a detrimental effect on the wildlife and pose dangers for the human. Provision for deposit, collection, and removal of all waste will also have a direct impact on the local environment.\n\nTourism can act as a vector in the spread of non-native species. With tourism comes an increase and concentration of human activity in specific localized regions of the landscape especially protected wildernesses and parks. Because of the increase in human visitation from many different geographical regions, non-native species are observed at a higher propagation rate in these areas. Typical recreation activities such as hiking, biking, and off-road driving can act as habitat disturbances which may increase the spread of aggressive invasive species, harming the natural ecosystem. Nature-based tourism (i.e., wildlife viewing and outdoor recreation) are thought to be increasing and often happen in more pristine habitats. With the disturbance from human activities, open niches may become available giving opportunity for aggressive non-native species to become established and take advantage of new resource availability. This can have dire consequences on local flora and fauna as invasives tend to be particularly successful in colonizing disturbed areas where the local biotic communities have been affected and potentially harmed.\n\nExamples of invasive species spread by tourism:\n-Bigheaded ant (Pheidole megacephala): Is one of the worst invasives and classified under the “worlds 100 worst” invasive species. Originally found in the Galapagos islands in 2007 within ship cargo for tourist supplies. Ants can be spread with the movement of people from one island to another. \n-Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum): Spread fast, don’t allow native species to grow, can cause forest fires to spread rapidly. Can be carried by people through shoes and gear, pets and other animals can spread the seeds through their travel as well. \n-Zebra Mussels (Dreissena polymorpha): These are believed to have come from the Caspian Sea in Europe in a ships ballast water. They are spread by uncleansed boats from one body of water to another as tourists move to different locations. \n\nThere are ways to decrease the spread of non-native species such as taking care in removing seeds from shoes and pants after hiking or biking. Thoroughly cleaning boats when moving from one body of water to another and creating designated pathway management plans are other ways in which one can decrease the impacts of invasive species on local habitats.\n\nAnother activity that can have severe direct and indirect impacts on the environment is wildlife viewing. This happens in a range of formats, on land and in the ocean. Wildlife safaris in African countries such as Kenya, Botswana, and Tanzania have been popular for many years. Their focus are the big five game megafauna: the African lion, African elephant, African leopard, cape buffalo, and rhinoceros. As with every human-wildlife interaction, there is a change in the natural interaction of the species. The mere presence of humans can increase the heart rate and stress hormones of even the largest animal. Other changes in behavior have been recognized. For example, baboons and hyenas have learnt to track tourist safari vehicles to lead them to cheetah kills, which they then steal. This direct impact of can severely damage the delicate balance of the food webs and keystone species.\n\nThere is a small but significant number of tourists who pay considerable sums of money in order to trophy hunt lions, rhino, leopards, and even giraffes. It has been argued that there is a positive and negative, direct and indirect, environmental impact caused by trophy hunting. There is a continued discussion at federal and international government level as to the ethics of funding conservation efforts through hunting activities.\n\nAnother tourism destination activity is scuba diving. There are many negative direct environmental impacts caused by recreational diving. The most apparent is the damage caused by poorly skilled divers standing on the reef itself or by accidentally hitting the fragile coral with their fins. Studies have shown that \"naïve\" divers who engage in underwater photography are considerably more likely to accidentally damage the reef. As the cost of underwater photography equipment has declined and its availability increased, it is inevitable that there will be an increase of direct damage to reefs by divers. Other direct impacts include over-fishing for \"marine curios\", sedimentation, and in-fill. There is also direct environmental impact due to disturbed and altered species behaviour from fish feeding, as well as import of invasive species and pollution caused by dive-boats. There are also indirect impacts such as shoreline construction of superstructure and infrastructure.\n\nSince 2009 there has been a steady yearly increase in the number of tourist arrivals worldwide of approximately 4.4 percent. In 2015 there were 1.186 billion tourist arrivals worldwide, of which 54 percent arrived by air (640 million), 39 percent (462 million) by motor vehicle, 5 percent by water (59 million), and 2 percent by rail (23.7 million). A seven-hour flight on a Boeing 747 produces 220 tonnes of CO, which is the equivalent of driving an average size family saloon car for a year, or the energy requirement of an average family home for nearly 17 years. With the ever-increasing number of tourist arrivals, there is an ever-increasing quantity of global greenhouse gasses (GHG) being produced by the tourism industry. In 2015 it is estimated that 5 percent of global GHG emissions was attributable to air travel alone.\n\nAs more eco-tourists seek remote, pristine, undeveloped regions, and practise low-impact, \"leave no trace\" adventure vacations, their GHG contributions have increased exponentially. As a result of the accumulation of GHGs the annual average global temperature is rising each year. New records were set in 2014, 2015 and it is predicted that 2016 will yet again exceed the previous highest average global temperature. It is causing the oceans to warm and causing increased frequency of abnormal weather events such as floods and hurricanes. The increase in the amount of CO dissolved into the oceans is changing its chemical composition, leading to acidification of the oceans, which in turn has led to bleaching of coral reefs worldwide.\n\nIn 2016 it was determined that the world's largest coral reef, the Great Barrier Reef, is so badly affected by bleaching that only 10 percent remained unspoiled and the remaining 90 percent has varying degrees of degradation A recently discovered issue in the Pacific Northwest caused by acidification, is the decreased survival of pteropods, a key source of food for salmon. These microscopic invertebrates, known as sea butterflies, are unable to form their outer shells and die. These tiny creatures make up a significant portion of the salmon diet. Without this nutrition available to the salmon, they may not grow to maturity to return to their spawning grounds to reproduce and provide food for bears. Bears cycle nutrients through the forest, where tourists come to view or hunt the bears. Thus the food web is disturbed. Anthropogenic climate change has both a direct and indirect impact on tourism.\n\nAn inherent aspect of tourism is the seeking of authenticity, the desire to experience a different cultural setting in its natural environment. Although cultural tourism provides opportunities for understanding and education, there are serious impacts that arise as a result. It is not only the volume of tourism at work, but the types of social interactions that occur between tourist and host. There are three broad effects at the local level: the commodification of culture, the demonstration effect, and the acculturation of another culture.\n\nCommodification of culture refers to the use of a cultural traditions and artifacts in order to sell and profit for the local economy. With the rise of tourism, authors argue that commodification is inevitable. There are both positive and negative sociocultural impacts of commodification on a culture. One positive is the creation of business and jobs for local craftsmen, who are able to sell their goods to tourists. Rural tourism is seen as a “cure” for poverty and leads to the improvement of transportation and development of telecommunications in an area. For the tourist, commodification creates an interest for traditional arts and social practices. However, critics of commodification believe that tourists are not interested in cultural beliefs and traditions of the locals, but are rather obsessed with owning a part of it. The argument that by monetizing cultural artifacts locals lose the value to their culture also exists. It then leads to the belief that tours are no longer authentic experiences. However, development economists will argue that culture can be utilized just as any other natural resource.\n\nResearchers look at the impact of tourists on a culture and in short, many argue that the contact with the secular West leads to the destruction of pre-tourist cultures. In addition, the “development cure”, the idea that increasing tourism will spur economic change while strengthening local culture, is claimed to lead to new diseases, such as “drug addiction, crime, pollution, prostitution, and a decline in social stability” as well as growth of capitalist values and a consumer culture.\n\nThe demonstration effect was introduced to tourism when researchers were looking into the effects of social influences from tourism on local communities. The demonstration effect argues that local inhabitants copy the behavioral patterns of tourists. There are a number of social, economic and behavioral reasons as to why the demonstration effect comes into play. One economic and social reason is that locals copy the consumption patterns of those higher up the social scale in order to improve their social status. Tourism has also been accused of affecting social behavior of the younger members of a host community, who may imitate what tourists do, impacting traditional value systems.\n\nThere are many criticisms to the demonstration effect in tourism. Firstly, tourism is seen as only one aspect of change in a society. Local people will also see examples of foreign lifestyles and consumption in advertisements, magazines, on television, and in films, and therefore tourism is not the only influence on local culture. In addition, the demonstration effect implies that a culture is “weak” and needs to be protected by outside influences. In many cases, the demonstrative effect is seen as a negative consequence, but it is argued that “all cultures are in a continual process of change”, therefore tourism should not be considered destructive.\n\nCommunity participation refers to the collaboration between community members for the purposes of achieving common goals, improving their local community and pursuing individual benefits. Local community members are actively involved in tourism, rather than passively benefiting from it. Community participation strengthens communities and help to create a sense of belonging, trust and credibility among members. By involving local community members, tourism can become more authentic. The community and the tourists both benefit from community participation, as it boosts their respect for the traditional lifestyle and values of the destination community. Most destination community members are also the ones most impacted by tourism, therefore there is an importance in their involvement in tourism planning. Some researchers will argue that some of the negative impacts of tourism might be avoided and the positive impacts maximized through community participation in the planning process.\n\nAcculturation is the process of modifying an existing culture through borrowing from the more dominant of cultures. Typically in tourism, the community being acculturated is the destination community, which then experiences dramatic shifts in social structure and world view. Societies adapt to acculturation in one of two ways. Innovation diffusion is when the community adopts practices that are developed by another group; whereas cultural adaptation is less adoption of a new culture and more the process of changing when the existing culture is changed. Acculturation is often seen as a method of modernizing a community and there are many opposing views to the concept of modernization. One argument against modernization is that it contributes to the “homogenization of cultural differences and the decline of traditional societies”. This means that communities will advertise their modernity to attract tourists, and will disregard their traditional customs and values. On the other hand, others argue that acculturation and modernization will help traditional communities adjust in a modern world. The idea being that teaching people to adapt will save the community from future extinction.\n\nThere are number of benefits for the host community as a result of tourism. This includes economic benefits such as opportunities for local businesses which allows for increased trade among the increased number of visitors and then develops a variety of local businesses. In addition, tourism also brings employment opportunities, enhances the economy of the region, and creates revenue for the local government. Tourists also use public services, creating funding for public services, such as health, the police and the fire department, as well as increasing the demand for public transport. Other public facilities, such as parks and benches are also well kept by the community for the tourists, improving the overall aesthetics of the host community. On a more social level, tourism leads to intercultural interaction. Tourists often engage and learn from the locals. Tourism can also increase pride in locals. They want to show off their community that tourists have chosen to visit. The increase in people also leads to creating more social venues and experiences where locals and tourists can interact in. Entertainment and recreational facilities will allow for more opportunity to socialize and engage with each other. Tourism can be beneficial for the host community as it provides the financial means and the incentive to preserve cultural histories, local heritage sites, and customs. It stimulates interest in local crafts, traditional activities, songs, dance, and oral histories. It also opens up the community to the wider world, new ideas, new experiences, and new ways of thinking.\n\nThere can be negative effects from cultural interactions. In terms of economic disadvantages, local communities need to be able to fund the tourist demands, which leads to an increase of taxes. The overall price of living increases in tourist destinations in terms of rent and rates, as well as property values going up. This can be problematic for locals looking to buy property or others on a fixed income. In addition, to balance out tourist destinations, the number of locals to tourists must be relatively equal. This can be more problematic for tourists as their access could be denied. Other negative sociocultural impacts are differences in social and moral values among the local host community and the visiting tourist. Outside of affecting the relationship between tourist and local, it can also cause friction between groups of the local population. In addition, it can cause drifts in the dynamics between the old and new generations. Tourism has also correlated to the rise of delinquent behaviors in local host communities. Crime rates have been seen to rise with the increase of tourists. Crimes are typically those of rowdy behavior, alcohol and illegal drug use, and loud noise. In addition, gambling and prostitution is increased due to tourists looking for a “good time”. Tourism has also caused more disruption in host communities. Crowding of locals and tourists may create a vibrant ambiance, it also causes frustration and leads to the withdrawal of local residents in many places. Increased tourists also results in increased traffic which can hinder daily life of the local residents.\n\nGlobal tourism in 2014 contributed 3.7 percent (US$2.5 billion) to the world's GDP, with its total contribution rising to almost 10 percent of world GDP. The GDP increase comes from the over one billion international tourists worldwide, a number that has been growing by 5 percent annually since 2012. Visits and boosts to GDP are expected to continue to rise in the near future as falling oil prices contribute to reduced living costs and increased available income for households, as well as reduced costs for air travel.\n\nTourism can be divided into subcategories into which impacts fall: spending from visitors on tourism experiences like beach holidays and theme parks (domestic and international), spending on leisure items like bicycles, business spending, and capital investment.\n\nThe economic contribution of tourism is felt in both direct and indirect ways, where direct economic impacts are created when commodities like the following are sold: accommodation and entertainment, food and beverages services, and retail opportunities. Residents, visitors, businesses, and various levels of governments (municipal to federal) all influence direct tourism impacts through their spending in or near a given tourism area. The key component of direct economic impacts of tourism is that they occur within a country's borders and are implemented by \"residents and non-residents for business and leisure purposes\".\n\nIn contrast, indirect economic impacts of tourism can be found in investment spending surrounding a tourism offering from private and governmental interests. This investment may not explicitly be related to tourism, but benefits the tourist and local stakeholders all the same. Indirect impacts of tourism are exemplified by the purchase and sale of intermediary items like additional supplies for restaurants during the high tourism season, or widened sidewalks in busy downtown centres. Indirect economic impacts (the supply chain, investment, and government collective) account for 50.7 percent of the total GDP contribution from travel and tourism in 2014.\n\nInduced spending, the re-circulation of a tourist dollar within a community, is another way that tourism indirectly has an impact on a community. For example, a foreign tourist injects money into the local economy when he spends a dollar on a souvenir made by a local at the tourism destination. That individual goes on to spend that dollar on lunch from a local vendor, and that vendor goes on to spend it locally.\n\nThere are both positive and negative effects on communities related to the economic impacts of tourism in their communities. A positive impact can refer to the increase in jobs, a higher quality of life for locals, and an increase in wealth of an area. Tourism also has the advantage of rebuilding and restoring historic sites and encouraging the revitalization of cultures. A positive impact is to increase or to make better either for the tourist, the host community and residence and/or the tourist destination. Positive impacts are related more to the materialistic well-being, rather than to the happiness of a host community or tourist.\n\nThe tourist destination enjoys positive impacts, if there have been improvements to the natural environment such as protection, national parks, or man-made infrastructure, waste-treatment plants. Tourism provides the economic stimulus to allow for diversification of employment and income potential, and develop resources within the community. Improvements in infrastructure and services can benefit both the locals and the tourists. Whereas, heritage tourism focuses on local history or historical events that occurred in the area, and tends to promote education. Positive impacts begin when there is an increase in job opportunities for locals as the tourism industry becomes more developed. There is also an increase in average income that spreads throughout the community when tourism is capitalized on. In addition, the local economy is stimulated and diversified, goods are manufactured more locally, and new markets open for local business owners to expand to. Unfortunately, these benefits are not universal nor invulnerable. While more employment may be available, tourism-related jobs are often seasonal and low-paying. Prices are known to fluctuate throughout the year. They rise in the high tourist season to take advantage of more tourist dollars, but have the side effect of pricing goods above the economic reach of local residents, effectively starving them out of a place that was once their home.\n\nNegative impacts are the effects, that are caused in most cases, at the tourist destination site with detrimental impacts to the social and cultural area, as well as the natural environment. As the population increases so do the impacts, resources become unsustainable and exhausted, the carrying capacity for tourists in a destination site may become depleted. Often, when negative impacts occur, it is too late to impose restrictions and regulations. Tourist destinations seem to discover that many of the negative impacts are found in the development stage of the tourism area life cycle (TALC).\n\nAdditionally, the economics of tourism have been shown to push out local tourism business owners in favour of strangers to the region. Foreign ownership creates leakage (revenues leaving the host community for another nation or multinational business) which strips away the opportunity for locals to make meaningful profits. Foreign companies are also known to hire non-resident seasonal workers because they can pay those individuals lower wages, which further contributes to economic leakage. Tourism can raise property values near the tourism area, effectively pushing out locals and encouraging businesses to migrate inwards to encourage and take advantage of more tourist spending.\n\nEmployment, and both its availability and exclusivity, are subsets of economic impacts of tourism. Travel and tourism create 10.7 percent of the total available jobs worldwide, in both the direct and indirect tourism sectors. Direct tourism jobs, those that provide the visitor with their tourism experience include, but are not limited to: accommodation (building, cleaning, managing), food and drink services, entertainment, manufacturing, and shopping Indirect tourism employment opportunities include the manufacturing of aircraft, boats, and other transportation, as well as the construction of additional superstructure and infrastructure necessary to accommodate these travel products (airports, harbours, etc.)\n\nThe World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) tourism satellite account (TSA) is a system of measurement recognized by the United Nations to define the extent of an economic sector that is not so easily defined as industries like forestry or oil and gas Tourism does not fit neatly into a statistical model; because it is not so much dependent on the physical movement of products and services, as it is on the position of the consumer. Therefore, TSAs were designed to standardize these many offerings for an international scale to facilitate better understanding of current tourism circumstances locally and abroad. The standardization includes concepts, classifications, and definitions, and is meant to enable researchers, industry professionals, and the average tourism business owner to view international comparisons.\nBefore TSAs were widely implemented, a gap existed in the available knowledge about tourism as an economic driver for GDP, employment, investment, and industry consumption; indicators were primarily approximations and therefore lacking in scientific and analytical viewpoints. This gap meant missed opportunities for development, as tourism stakeholders were unable to understand where they might be able to better establish themselves in the tourism economy. For example, a TSA can measure tax revenues related to tourism, which is a key contributor to the level of enthusiasm any level of government might have towards potential tourism investment. In addition, Tyrrell and Johnston suggest that stakeholders in tourism benefit from the TSA because it:\n\nThrough collection of more qualitative data and translating it into a more concise and effective form for tourism providers, TSAs are able to fill the previous knowledge gap. Information delivered and measured by a TSA includes tax revenues, economic impact on national balances, human resources, employment, and \"tourism's contribution to gross domestic product\".\n\nPredictions for the extent to which impacts of tourism will impact the world's economic system appear to agree that the number of international tourist arrivals will reach approximately 1.6 billion by the year 2020. Of those tourists, 1.18 billion are expected to be intra-regional, and 377 million to be long-haul. Of these travelers, arrivals in developing countries are expected to continue growing from the recorded 47% of total arrivals recorded in 2011 as access to these more remote locations becomes easier\nDirect contributions of travel and tourism to the world economy and GDP are expected to rise from 3.09 percent in 2015 to 3.3 percent in 2025, with most impacts found in the investment and supply chain sectors. Employment is anticipated to rise parallel to GDP contributions; reaching 3.9 percent of world employment in 2025 (up from 3.6 percent in 2015). Direct tourism employment in 2025 will be an estimated 3.9 percent of total world employment (up from approximately 3.6 percent in 2015), while indirect tourism employment will be at approximately 4.5 percent (up from 3.6 percent in 2015).\n\n"}

It was originally published in two parts in the June/July and August 2012 issues of \"Esquire\" magazine. This is King and Hill's second collaboration since \"Throttle\", published in 2009. On October 9, 2012, \"In the Tall Grass\" was released in e-book and audiobook formats, the latter read by Stephen Lang.\n\nCal and Becky Demuth are inseparable siblings (being called Irish-twins by their parents, although they are 19 months apart). Becky finds out during her sophomore year of college that she is pregnant, leading the twins' parents to suggest she go live with her aunt and uncle until the baby is born. Since it is spring break, Cal decides to accompany her on her cross-country trip. They stop at numerous tourist locations along the way, including the biggest ball of twine.\n\nAfter driving for about three days, they stop at a field of tall grass after they hear a little boy named Tobin calling for help. The twins stand outside the field, listening to Tobin screaming for help, and his mother Natalie yelling at him to stop yelling, saying that \"he will hear you\". Cal thinks he hears Tobin just a few feet inside the field. Cal walks into it to rescue the boy, Natalie's cries having mysteriously gone silent. At first, Tobin's voice sounds so close, Cal dives for him, only to end up lying in a puddle of gritty water. Tobin's voice now sounds about twenty feet away.\n\nBecky, scared of being left alone, calls 911 as she follows Cal into the field, but the signal is cut off when she is just a few feet in. While trudging along looking for Tobin (and Becky), Cal stumbles across a golden retriever's dead body, having died of dehydration. An hour and a half of cat-and-mouse calling, running, and chasing later, none of the three have located each other.\n\nBecky continues to call for Cal and Tobin, but has no luck and recites limericks to comfort herself, as she is dehydrated and tired. She spies someone ahead, and a man steps out of the grass in front of her. He introduces himself as Ross, saying that he is the father of Tobin and the husband of Natalie. He begs Becky to follow him, saying that she will be safe with him. Despite not trusting Ross, she follows him anyway. He lures her to a stamped-down circle of grass, where Becky finds Natalie's bloody, dismembered body. Ross explains that he found \"the rock\" and that \"the dancing men have shown him the secrets of the tall grass\". He then attacks her, trying to kill the baby, but Becky stabs him to death with her house key.\n\nCal, now severely dehydrated and exhausted in his attempts to look for Becky, feverishly drinks the gritty water that the long grass grows in. Now half-crazed, he attempts to burn down the field, but the grass is so wet that none of his matches burn for more than a few seconds. He then finally runs into Tobin, who is eating a dead, rotting crow. Tobin explains that the rotting dog was his, and that \"the tall grass doesn't move dead things.\" Tobin leads Cal into a clearing in the middle of the grass, where a large rock (with strange drawings of dancing men and words written all over it) stands in the middle of it. Tobin says that the rock will help Cal find Becky like the rock helped Tobin and Ross find each other. Cal, despite his fear of the rock and the strange, seemingly-moving drawings, gives in and touches it.\n\nMeanwhile, Becky gives premature birth. Cal and Tobin then appear and wrap the baby in a shirt. Becky then passes out to \"slurping sounds.\" When she wakes up, her baby is nowhere in sight. Cal and Tobin drag a half-conscious Becky to the rock and throw her on it.\n\nAn unspecified amount of time later, an RV full of hippies pulls into a parking lot across the street to have a barbeque and smoke marijuana. They hear Tobin's calls for help, and the whole group walks into the tall grass to help.\n\nDirector Vincenzo Natali wanted to do a film adaption of \"In The Tall Grass\" as early as 2015 when he announced:\"Who would think that grass could be frightening? Trust Stephen King and Joe Hill to find a way. They have transformed an otherwise innocuous Kansas field into a stage for some of the most disturbing horror fiction I have ever read.\" but the project failed to start. Then in May 2018 the video streaming site Netflix announced that it has purchased the film rights with Vincenzo Natali as director, who also wrote the adapted screenplay. Actor James Marsden is in talks to star. Filming will begin in the Summer of 2018 in Toronto. \n\nOn May 28, 2018. Vincenzo Natali announced via Twitter that manga artist Shintaro Kago will be the concept art designer for the film adaption.\n\nOn July 23, 2018. A construction crew was spotted building an abandoned church in Perth South, Ontario for the film.\n\n"}

The existence of this linguistic border led to differentiate the Celtic-speaking Lower Brittany (West) from the Romance-speaking Upper Brittany (East).\n\nThe farthest eastern extension of the Breton language was in the ninth century, when the linguistic border was located near Nantes and Rennes. Breton declined inexorably in favor of the Gallo gradually moving westward along a Binic-Guérande line. The border can now be traced along a line from Plouha to Rhuys. The linguistic unification of France, completed after World War II, made somewhat obsolete the linguistic aspect of the distinction between Upper and Lower Brittany, although many people still consider it valid in terms of toponymy, culture and identity.\n\nPlace-names are one form of evidence for the linguistic boundary during the Early Middle Ages, suggesting that it was much farther to the east than it is now, near Nantes and Rennes. For example, Pleugueneuc, in Ille-et-Vilaine, combines the Breton element \"plou\" (parish) with the name 'Guehenoc'.\n\nThe distinction of two Brittanys was made at least as early as the 15th century, when the names used were \"Britannia gallicana\" (Gallic Brittany) and \"Britannia britonizans\" (Brittonic Brittany). At that time, it appears that Lower Brittany had a separate fiscal status. Since then, the boundary between them has changed slowly as a result of the long retreat of the Breton language.\n\nUnder the \"ancien régime\", the boundary between the two was generally in line with the province's division into nine bishoprics, with those of Rennes, Dol, Nantes, St Malo and St Brieuc considered to form Upper Brittany, while Tréguier, Vannes, Quimper and Saint-Pol-de-Léon formed Lower Brittany.\n\nIn 1588, the historian Bertrand d'Argentré defined the boundary as running from the outskirts of Binic southwards to Guérande, leaving the towns of Loudéac, Josselin, and Malestroit in Upper Brittany. In 1886, Paul Sébillot noted that the boundary was deeper into what had been Breton territory, the line then running from Plouha on the north coast to Batz-sur-Mer in the south, on the Bay of Biscay.\n\nThe boundary between 'Upper' and 'Lower' Brittany is now a purely imaginary line and has no administrative or other status. However, having been based on linguistic areas, the boundary does correspond very roughly to administrative borders. The town of Ploërmel is one point where the two meet.\n\nIn area, Upper Brittany now takes in something over half of the 35,000 square kilometres of the whole of Brittany, but it has some 2.5 million people, compared with Lower Brittany's 1.6 million. In the early 20th century, about 60% of the population had lived in the Breton-speaking areas.\n\n"}

{"id": "1608006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1608006", "title": "Mansaf", "text": "Mansaf\n\nMansaf () is a traditional Arab dish made of lamb cooked in a sauce of fermented dried yogurt and served with rice or bulgur. \n\nIt is the national dish of Jordan, and can also be found in Palestine, Iraq, Southern Syria and Saudi Arabia. The name of the dish comes from the term \"large tray\" or \"large dish\".\n\nThe original pastoralist Bedouin mansaf underwent significant changes in the 20th century. The dish is said to originally have been made with simply meat (camel or lamb), meat broth or ghee (clarified butter) and bread. Following the popularization of rice in northern Jordan in the 1920s, rice gradually was introduced into the dish, at first mixed with bulgur, and later on its own, until the dish reached its modern incarnation of being based on white rice. Similarly, the jamid sauce is a recent development, as the Bedouins did not historically feature jamid in their cooked dishes until their modern sedentarization.\n\nJameed is a hard dry yogurt that is prepared by the boiling of sheep or goat's milk, which is then left to dry and ferment. The mixture is later kept in a fine woven cheesecloth to make a thick yogurt. Salt is added daily to thicken the yogurt even more for a few days, which then becomes very dense and is shaped into round balls. The city of Al-Karak in Jordan has a reputation for producing the highest quality of jameed.\n\nA jameed broth is prepared and the pieces of lamb are cooked in it. The dish is served on a large platter with a layer of flatbread (markook or shrak) topped with rice and then meat, garnished with almonds and pine nuts, and then the creamy jameed sauce is poured on top of the dish.\n\nMansaf is associated with a traditional Jordanian culture based on an agro-pastoral lifestyle in which meat and yogurt are readily available. Mansaf is served on special occasions such as weddings, births and graduations, or to honor a guest, and on major holidays such as Eid ul-Fitr, Eid ul-Adha, Christmas, Easter and Jordan's Independence Day. It is traditionally eaten collectively from a large platter in the Bedouin and rural style, standing around the platter with the left hand behind the back and using the right hand instead of utensils.\n\nSince mansaf was originally popular among Bedouins, much of the traditions that they used with the dish still exist today. The tray containing mansaf is placed on a table where people gather around it while standing. Mansaf should be eaten with the use of a person's right hand only while the left is behind the person's back. The hand is used to create balls of rice and then the ball is placed in the mouth through the use of three fingers. It is frowned upon to blow on the ball of rice, no matter how hot. Many of these traditions are still used; however, it can also be eaten with spoons and plates.\n\nThough mansaf is frequently referred to as Jordan's \"national dish\", Massad states that mansaf is not a truly \"traditional\" dish, but is rather a more recent dish which was developed during the Hashemite-Mandatory era of the early 20th century, and then promulgated as a \"national\" dish following independence. Massad notes that the current form of mansaf differs from the independence-era and Mandate-era recipes, but is portrayed by the state as a dish that is both national and a Bedouin tradition, despite it also historically being a dish of the peasants and Bedouins of the neighboring regions of Palestine and Syria.\n\nThe inhabitants of Al-Salt and Al-Karak are reputed to make the best mansaf in Jordan. Other variants of the dish also exist and are adapted to the regional tastes and circumstances. These include fish mansaf, found in the south around the port city of Aqaba. An urban, less ceremonial adaptation of mansaf using non-dried yogurt is called \"shakreyyeh\". It is sometimes cooked with poultry instead of lamb and is common in the northern part of Jordan.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27316857", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27316857", "title": "Michael Edwards (academic)", "text": "Michael Edwards (academic)\n\nMichael Aubrey \"Mike\" Edwards (born Liverpool, England, 1957) is a writer and activist who has worked in various positions in foundations, think-tanks and international development institutions and who has written widely on civil society, philanthropy and social transformation. He has been a Distinguished Senior Fellow at Demos in New York and has worked in senior management positions for Oxfam (as Regional Director for Southern Africa), Voluntary Service Overseas (as Head of Development Education), Save the Children (as Director of Research, Evaluation and Advocacy), the World Bank (as a Senior Civil Society Specialist) and the Ford Foundation (as director of its Governance and Civil Society Program). He also co-founded the Seasons Fund for Social Transformation which made grants to organizations that link their work for social justice with spiritual principles and contemplative practices before it closed in 2010. His writings examine the global role of civil society and its institutions, the purpose and impact of philanthropy and the not-for-profit sector, the role of business in solving social problems, and the links between personal and social transformation.\n\nAfter completing his undergraduate education at Oxford University and his PhD in geography at University College London (UCL), Edwards left academia to join the NGO sector. He first came to prominence in the 1980s during his work with Oxfam when he criticized the “Irrelevance of Development Studies” in an article that sparked many years of debate about the extractive nature of social science research, a theme that he has continued to pursue ever since. In the 1990s he and David Hulme from Manchester University turned their attention to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and hosted a series of influential conferences on scaling-up their impact, strengthening their performance and accountability, assessing the costs and benefits of closer ties between NGOs, governments and international donor agencies, and exploring how NGOs could adapt to globalization and the increasing diversity of the “North” and the “South.” More recently he has been critical of trends in the NGO sector towards growth and bureaucracy, which he argues may dilute their commitment to radical social change. These views are summarized in a piece entitled \"What's to be done with Oxfam?\" which appeared on openDemocracy in 2016.\n\nIn the 2000s Edwards began to write about civil society more broadly than NGOs, and published an influential introductory text called “Civil Society” which was updated in 2009 and again in 2014 to take account of changing developments in the field. By disaggregating the concept of civil society into theories of associational life, the good society and the public sphere and then analyzing the links that exist between them, Edwards’ work has helped to clarify the confusion that has surrounded these ideas. His conceptual framework has been used by many others including The Carnegie Inquiry into the Future of Civil Society in the UK and Ireland and the Oxford Handbook of Civil Society that was published in 2011.\n\nIn 1997 Edwards left the NGO sector to join the World Bank, and then moved to the Ford Foundation in 1999 where for nine years he directed the Governance and Civil Society Program. Just before leaving the Foundation in 2008 he wrote a controversial pamphlet for Demos and the Young Foundation called “Just Another Emperor: The Myths and Realities of Philanthrocapitalism,” which challenged the trend to introduce business thinking into philanthropy and the not-for-profit sector, later expanded into a book called \"Small Change: Why Business Won’t Save the World\". Since then Edwards has continued to oppose this trend in his writing, arguing that \"business should become more like civil society, not the other way around.\"\n\nEdwards has also pushed back against closer ties between philanthropic foundations and the corporate sector, arguing that they need to be separate in order for foundations to retain their independence. He criticized the decision of Ford Foundation president Darren Walker to accept a paid position on the board of Pepsico Inc in a series of articles published in 2016. More broadly his work shows why even high and rising levels of philanthropy have failed to have any measurable effect on inequality and injustice at a national scale.\n\nThe final theme in Edwards’ work is the need to connect personal with social transformation, taking up ideas that were developed by Gandhi in India (“we must be the change we want to see in the world”) and by Martin Luther King and the Civil Rights Movement (\"building the beloved community” through “the love that does justice”). Writing with colleagues such as Gita Sen and Stephen G. Post, Edwards is a member of an emerging movement for social and spiritual change called “spiritual activism.” \n\nIn recognition of this work, Edwards received the Gandhi, King, Ikeda Award from Morehouse College in 2011 at a ceremony held at the Coady International Institute in Canada.\n\nIn 2013 Edwards launched a new section of the web-magazine openDemocracy called \"Transformation\" \"to tell the stories of those who are exploring boundary-breaking solutions in politics, economics and social activism by bringing personal and social change together into one integrated process.\" He introduced this project in an article that explores the relationships between love and social justice in the modern world, followed up in a series of essays on mysticism and social change, religion and progressive politics, the need for harmony amid increasing polarization, and the \"virtues of a many-sided life.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "586081", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=586081", "title": "Only Unity Saves the Serbs", "text": "Only Unity Saves the Serbs\n\nOnly Unity Saves the Serb (/\"samo sloga Srbina spasava\") is a popular motto and slogan in Serbia and among Serbs, often used as a rallying call against foreign domination and during times of national crisis. The phrase is an interpretation of what is taken to be four Cyrillic letters for \"S\" (written С) on the Serbian cross, itself originally a Byzantine symbol. Popular tradition attributes the motto to Saint Sava, the founder of the Serbian Orthodox Church.\n\nThe Serbian cross is based on the Palaiologos symbol, a cross with four β for the motto \"King of Kings, Ruling Over Kings\" (\"Basileus Basileōn, Basileuōn Basileuontōn\"). In the Middle Ages, both the \"Greek style\", with closed fire-steels (β - B), and the \"Serbian syle\", with open fire-steels (C - S), were used in Serbia. It has been argued that the Serbian cross was used as a national symbol already in the 14th century. The symbol was used in the Illyrian Armorials for Serbia. The Serbian cross reappeared during the First Serbian Uprising against the Ottoman Empire, from 1804 to 1813, and has since been used in state insignia. It served as a reference to the medieval Serbian Empire and professed the part which Serbs played in defending Christendom against the Ottoman Empire in the 14th century.\n\nAccording to legend, the origin of the C-shaped Serbian cross lies with Saint Sava, the first Archbishop of the autocephalous Serbian Church and the patron saint of Serbs, who based his design on the Byzantine original. The phrase \"Only Unity Saves the Serbs\" is traditionally attributed to him. He is said to have uttered it to urge the Serbian people to declare national autonomy and resist domination by the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nThe motto represents the \"idea of betrayal\", one of the main themes in the Kosovo Myth – the antithesis of Miloš Obilić's heroism embodied in the figure of Vuk Branković, which legend holds fled the battlefield, the moral of the story being that discord and betrayal among the Serbs had doomed the nation to fall. The slogan became a catch phrase.\n\nThe popular interpretation of the four \"C\" as 'Само Слога Србина Спасава' on the Serbian coat of arms dates to the 19th century, created due to nationalistic and political reasons. Jovan Sterija Popović in his dramatic historical allegory \"San Kraljevića Marka\" (1847) was the first to state that the firesteels were four \"C\" letters to be read that way, which \"pious patriotic souls have already took for sure\" as said by Đorđe Petrović in the \"Srbadija\" magazine for 1881.\n\nAuthor Biljana Vankovska argues that the first interpretation of the acronym CCCC was \"Serbia Alone Saved Herself\" (\"Sama Srbija sebe spasila\"), which then changed to \"Only Unity Saves the Serbs\" (\"Samo sloga Srbe spasava\"), reflecting the growing Serb fear of internal enemies. In the poem \"Jeka od gusala\" (\"echoes of gusles\", 1860), general and writer Jovan Dragašević (1836–1915) wrote \"Only concord saves the Serb, so it is written for the Serb on the coat of arms\" (Само Слога Србина Спасава, тако Србу пише и на грбу). Serbian poet and Orthodox priest Jovan Sundečić (1825–1900) in \"Osvetnici, ili nevina žrtva\" (1868) used \"Only Unity saves Slavdom\" (Samo sloga Slavenstvo spašava). In \"Pesme i običai\" (1869), a collection of poetry and traditions collected by M. S. Milojević, several interpretations are made. The same phrase as earlier used by Dragašević was used in the poem \"Smrt svetog Save\" (\"Death of St. Sava\", 1882) by Milorad Šimić. The phrase is found in written on towels and engraved on \"gusle\" dating to the 1880s and 1890s. Allegedly, the motto \"Samo sloga Srbina spasava\" was acronymed on the Montenegrin cap. It is used, acronymed, in Easter egg decorating.\n\nThe phrase was used in songs of the Serbian Sokol movement. In Vladan Đorđević's \"Car Dušan: Mladi kralj\" (1919), in the introduction, it is said \"Because only unity saves, not only the Serb, but the Croat and Slovene, Orthodox, Catholics and Muslims\".\n\nDuring World War II, the Main Staff of Chetnik Detachments in Bosnia and Herzegovina used it as an appeal in their struggle.\n\nThe acronym began appearing in Serbian nationalist graffiti during the 1980s. In 1989, Serbian President Slobodan Milošević delivered his infamous Gazimestan speech before a large, stone Orthodox cross bearing the acronym. In the early 1990s, as Yugoslavia began to disintegrate, Milošević's propaganda apparatus adopted the phrase \"Only Unity Saves the Serbs\". The acronym form of the phrase was featured with the Serbian cross on the insignia of the Army of the Republic of Serb Krajina during the Croatian War and on the insignia of the Army of Republika Srpska during the Bosnian War. The Serbian cross with the CCCC acronym was also used as a wing and fuselage marking on aircraft used by the Republika Srpska Air Force. The phrase was often scrawled on the walls of abandoned houses in towns captured by Serb forces, usually followed alongside the acronym JNA (for Yugoslav People's Army) and the names of individual soldiers. In the immediate aftermath of the Yugoslav Wars, license plates throughout the Republika Srpska featured the acronym. These were replaced several years later, following the introduction of nationwide license plates.\n\nSerbian singer-songwriter Bora Đorđević adapted the motto as the title to his song \"Samo sloga Srbina spasava\", written during the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.\n\nIn 2010, on the anniversary of the Battle of Loznica, Patriarch Irinej said that only unity could save the Serb people, and nonunity could ruin it.\n\nIn 2013, Slovenian politician and EP member Jelko Kacin congratulated that Kosovo Serb representatives had united despite political differences, in a delegation to the EP, with the words \"Bravo, Serbs, only unity saves the Serbs\".\n\nAn international conference of Serbian Orthodox youth with the name has been held in 2015 and 2016 in Republika Srpska.\n\n \n"}

Pom-poms are shaken by cheerleaders, pom or dance teams, and sports fans during spectator sports.\n\n\n\"Pom-pom\" is derived from the French word \"pompon\", which refers to a small decorative ball made of fabric or feathers. It also means an \"ornamental round tuft\" and originally refers to its use on a hat, or an \"ornamental tuft; tuft-like flower head.\"\n\nCheerleaders use pom-poms at sports events for six reasons:\n\n\nMost often, pom-poms are used in pairs (one in each hand), but this may vary with the particular requirements of the choreography of a dance or cheer.\n\nCheerleading pom-poms come in a variety of shapes, styles, colors, color combinations, and sizes. Shiny metallic pom-poms have become very popular in recent years.\n\nPom-poms are also waved by sports fans, primarily at college and high school sports events in the United States, Cheap, light-weight \"faux\" pom-poms in team colors are sometimes given or sold to spectators at such events.\n\nMany schools and universities have dance teams in addition to their cheerleading groups. The dance teams may also use pom-poms occasionally, but many high school dance teams are now referred to as \"Poms\" squads. These squads are similar to drill teams, but usually have several routines that they strictly use pom-poms. Pom-poms have also come to be included in dance competitions in the United States. In many states, \"Pom\" or \"Open Pom\" is considered its own style of dance during competitions. For this style dancers use pom-poms and moves that are specifically choreographed to include pom-poms, but usually incorporate hip-hop and jazz choreography as well. When judging a routine in the Pom or Open Pom category, judges typically look for clean, sharp movements and complete synchronization of the team. These dances occasionally use different colored pom-poms and outfits to convey a theme and the dance team will create pictures from their pom-poms that relate to this theme.\n\nSmall pom-poms may be used to adorn hats (such as Tam o' Shanters and some styles of the tuque), socks, fringed dresses, and other kinds of clothing.\n\nPom-poms form a conspicuous part of the uniform of French naval personnel, being sewn onto the crown of their round cap. Belgian sailors wear a light blue version.\n\nTraditional Italian wedding shoes have small pom-poms, as do some Turkish dancing shoes.\n\nRoman Catholic clergy wear the biretta. The colour of its pom-pom denotes the wearer's rank. Priests wear a black biretta with a black pom. Protonotaries and domestic prelates (now prelates of honour) have a scarlet pom on their black birettas, and Papal Chamberlains (now Chaplains to His Holiness) wear a Roman purple pom on their black birettas.\n\nBishops and archbishops wear a Roman purple biretta with matching pom. The scarlet birettas of the cardinals have no pom, only a red loop. There is no papal biretta.\n\nSome religious orders and congregations have unique birettas, such as the Norbertines who wear a white biretta with a white pom. Some St. Francis fathers wear a brown biretta with a black pom. Other orders may wear a black biretta with a white, green, or blue pom, or the black biretta of the secular priesthood.\n\nIn reference to Scottish Highland dress and Scottish military uniforms, the small pom-pom on the crown of such hats as the Balmoral, the Glengarry, and the Tam o' Shanter is called a \"toorie.\"\n\nThe toorie is generally made of yarn and is traditionally red on both Balmorals and Glengarries (although specific units have used other colours). It has evolved into the smaller pom-pom found on older-style golf caps and the button atop baseball caps.\n\nScots refer to any such hat decoration as a toorie, irrespective of the headgear.\n\nIn Australia, the term \"flogger\" is sometimes used rather than \"pom-pom\". Floggers are very large, heavy pom-poms in the team's colours. They sometimes require more than one person to lift them, and they are waved about when a goal is scored.\n\nFloggers are an important part of Australian rules football culture and cheer-squads.\n\nPom-poms are sometimes used as children's toys. They are a common feature at the ends of the handlebars of children's tricycles and bicycles. They are also used in children's artistic crafts to add texture and color.\n"}

It was founded in 1957 by Joseph Rotblat and Bertrand Russell in Pugwash, Nova Scotia, Canada, following the release of the Russell–Einstein Manifesto in 1955.\n\nRotblat and the Pugwash Conference jointly won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1995 for their efforts on nuclear disarmament. International Student/Young Pugwash groups have existed since founder Cyrus Eaton's death in 1979.\n\nThe Russell–Einstein Manifesto, released July 9, 1955, called for a conference for scientists to assess the dangers of weapons of mass destruction (then only considered to be nuclear weapons). Cyrus Eaton, an industrialist and philanthropist, offered on July 13 to finance and host the conference in the town of his birth, Pugwash, Nova Scotia. This was not taken up at the time because a meeting was planned for India, at the invitation of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. With the outbreak of the Suez Crisis the Indian conference was postponed. Aristotle Onassis offered to finance a meeting in Monaco instead, but this was rejected. Eaton's former invitation was taken up.\n\nThe first conference was held at what became known as Thinkers' Lodge in July 1957 in Pugwash, Nova Scotia. Twenty-two scientists attended the first conference:\nCyrus Eaton, Eric Burhop, Ruth Adams, Anne Kinder Jones, and Vladimir Pavlichenko also were present. Many others were unable to attend, including co-founder Bertrand Russell, for health reasons.\n\nPugwash's \"main objective is the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction (nuclear, chemical and biological) and of war as a social institution to settle international disputes. To that extent, peaceful resolution of conflicts through dialogue and mutual understanding is an essential part of Pugwash activities, that is particularly relevant when and where nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction are deployed or could be used.\"\n\n\"The various Pugwash activities (general conferences, workshops, study groups, consultations and special projects) provide a channel of communication between scientists, scholars, and individuals experienced in government, diplomacy, and the military for in-depth discussion and analysis of the problems and opportunities at the intersection of science and world affairs. To ensure a free and frank exchange of views, conducive to the emergence of original ideas and an effective communication between different or antagonistic governments, countries and groups, Pugwash meetings as a rule are held in private. This is the main modus operandi of Pugwash. In addition to influencing governments by the transmission of the results of these discussions and meetings, Pugwash also may seek to make an impact on the scientific community and on public opinion through the holding of special types of meetings and through its publications.\"\n\nOfficers include the president and secretary-general. Formal governance is provided by the Pugwash Council, which serves for five years. There is also an executive committee that assists the secretary-general. Jayantha Dhanapala is the current president. Paolo Cotta-Ramusino is the current Secretary General.\n\nThe four Pugwash offices, in Rome (international secretariat), London, Geneva, and Washington D.C., provide support for Pugwash activities and serve as liaisons to the United Nations and other international organizations.\n\nThere are approximately fifty national Pugwash groups, organized as independent entities and often supported or administered by national academies of science.\n\nThe International Student/Young Pugwash groups works with, but are independent from, the international Pugwash group.\n\nPugwash's first fifteen years coincided with the Berlin Crisis, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, and the Vietnam War. Pugwash played a useful role in opening communication channels during a time of otherwise-strained official and unofficial relations. It provided background work to the Partial Test Ban Treaty (1963), the Non-Proliferation Treaty (1968), the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (1972), the Biological Weapons Convention (1972), and the Chemical Weapons Convention (1993). Former US Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara has credited a backchannel Pugwash initiative (code named PENNSYLVANIA) with laying the groundwork for the negotiations that ended the Vietnam War. Mikhail Gorbachev admitted the influence of the organisation on him when he was leader of the Soviet Union. In addition, Pugwash has been credited with being a groundbreaking and innovative \"transnational\" organization and a leading example of the effectiveness of Track II diplomacy.\n\nDuring the Cold War, it was claimed that the Pugwash Conference became a front conference for the Soviet Union, whose agents often managed to weaken Pugwash critique of USSR and instead concentrate on blaming the United States and the West. In 1980, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence received a report that the Pugwash Conference was used by Soviet delegates to promote Soviet propaganda. Joseph Rotblat said in his 1998 Bertrand Russell Peace Lecture that there were a few participants in the conferences from the Soviet Union \"who were obviously sent to push the party line, but the majority were genuine scientists and behaved as such\".\n\nFollowing the end of the Cold War, the traditional Pugwash focus on decreasing the salience of nuclear weapons and promoting a world free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction addresses the following issue areas:\n\n\nThe Pugwash movement has also been concerned with environmental issues and as a result of its 1988 meeting in Dagomys it issued the Dagomys Declaration on Environmental Degradation (https://pugwash.org/1988/09/03/dagomys-declaration-of-the-pugwash-council/).\n\nIn 1995, fifty years after the bombing of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, and forty years after the signing of the Russell–Einstein Manifesto, the Pugwash Conferences and Joseph Rotblat were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize jointly\n\nThe Norwegian Nobel committee hoped that awarding the prize to Rotblat and Pugwash would\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Rotblat quoted a key phrase from the Manifesto:\n\nFrom the 1965 Pugwash conference came a recommendation to establish the International Foundation for Science \"in order to address the stultifying conditions under which younger faculty members in the universities of developing countries were attempting to do research\". The organization gives grants to early-career scientists in low-income countries for work on local water resources and biology.\n\n\n\nPugwash does not have formal membership. All participants take part in their individual capacities and not as representatives of any organization, institution or government. Anyone who has attended a meeting is considered a \"Pugwashite\". There are more than 3,500 \"Pugwashites\" worldwide.\n\n\n\nAs the birthplace of the Pugwash movement, the Thinkers' Lodge was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 2008.\n\nThe Jubilee 62nd Pugwash Conference devoted to nuclear disarmament will be held in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, in 2017. The conference will celebrate the 60th anniversary of the first Pugwash Conference, held in Pugwash, Nova Scotia in 1957. The theme of the conference is \"Confronting New Nuclear Dangers.\" The conference agenda will focus on strengthening the nuclear test ban and combating terrorism.\n\nThe Astana conference working groups include:\n\n"}

The editor-in-chief was Timothy Don. It was established in 1970 as \"Socialist Revolution\", was renamed as \"Socialist Review\" in 1978, and obtained its final title at the end of 2002.\n\n\"Socialist Revolution\", under its founding editor James Weinstein, began with a revolutionary perspective which was, however, very critical of the existing Marxist left (including the New Communist Movement as well as established organizations), which it saw as undemocratic both in its way of operating and in its political aspirations. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the magazine was strongly associated with the New American Movement and its politics in this period developed in a similar direction towards a more Social Democratic perspective. In the course of this development the magazine was renamed \"Socialist Review\" in 1978, meanwhile absorbing the short-lived \"Marxist Perspectives\". \n\nAmong the magazine's editors have been Eli Zaretsky, David Plotke, Jeffrey Escoffier, Leslie Kauffman, and David Trend.\n\nBecause the magazine had been founded in San Francisco with an editorial collective that included many University of California at Berkeley graduate students, it showed an openness to theory that was not universally shared by magazines on the left in the 1970s. As some of the original collective graduated and got teaching jobs in the Boston area, a second editorial collective was founded in nearby Somerville (and later a short-lived New York collective also came into existence for similar reasons). As the members of the Boston collective began to get tenure, the nature of the two main editorial collectives began to diverge, with the Boston Collective attracting junior faculty, while the Bay Area collective continued well into the 1980s to be composed primarily of graduate students and community activists. The Boston Collective was notable for the quality of its economic analysis, while the West Coast Collective was active in producing articles out of the various identity movements of the 1980s, always with an eye toward theory. During this period, a careful reader could tell exactly which collective was responsible for which articles in the magazine, but to most observers it meant that \"Socialist Review\" reflected the diversity of positions available on the left. \n\n\"Socialist Review\" came to be strongly associated with postmodern critical theory and evolved into a magazine with a strong cultural element. In 1991, \"Unfinished Business: 20 Years of Socialist Review\", containing a collection of 20 articles was published. \n\nIn 2002 the magazine's name was changed again, to \"Radical Society: A Review of Culture and Politics\". From 2002 to 2003 it was published by Routledge. , an independent publisher, Radical Society Ltd., took over publishing and relaunched its website, making past issues available online. \n\nAs of the end of 2006, the editor-in-chief of \"Radical Society\" was Timothy Don. The magazine has since ceased publication.\n\nA substantial archive of Socialist Review's editorial correspondence, manuscripts, and records was acquired by the Paley Library of Temple University in the 1990s. It is housed in the library's Contemporary Culture Collection.\n\nIn the first issue or \"Radical Society\", the editors wrote that the inspirations for the journal were \"both old and new--from \"The Masses\" and Emma Goldman's \"Mother Earth\" to the Harlem Renaissance and the Paris Commune, from the end of the cold war to the beginnings of a new global justice movement\".\n\n"}

Though they are similar, catchphrases are not considered running gags.\n\nRunning gags can begin with an instance of unintentional humor that is repeated in variations as the joke grows familiar and audiences anticipate reappearances of the gag. The humor in a running gag may derive entirely from how often it is repeated, however the underlying statement or situation will always require some form of jocularity. Therefore, a statement which is merely trivial in nature will not turn into a running gag simply by being repeated over and over again. A running gag may also derive its humor from the (in)appropriateness of the situation in which the gag occurs, or setting up the audience to expect another occurrence of the joke and then substituting something else (\"bait and switch\"). Running gags are found mostly in television shows, but also appear in other places, such as video games, films, books, and comic strips.\n\nA running gag can be verbal or visual and may \"convey social values by echoing belligerent speakers with a barrage of caricatured threats.\" For example, a character may present others with a proposition that is so ridiculous or outrageous it is likely to be self-mocking to the point where the original request has little or no chance of actually being carried out and results in a humorous effect. Occasionally, the characters themselves may be aware of the running gag and make humorous mention of it.\n\n"}

Tentacles is a fictional character voiced by actor Rodger Bumpass in the American animated television series \"SpongeBob SquarePants\". Squidward was created and designed by marine biologist and animator Stephen Hillenburg. He first appeared on television in the series' pilot episode \"Help Wanted\" on May 1, 1999.\n\nAlthough his name has the word \"squid\" in it and he has six arms, Squidward is an anthropomorphic octopus. He lives in a moai between SpongeBob SquarePants' and Patrick Star's houses. The character is portrayed as ill-tempered, manipulative, pretentious, cynical and incredibly hostile, and he strongly despises his neighbors for their constant annoying, noisy behavior. However, the pair are unaware of Squidward's antipathy towards them and see him as a friend. Squidward works as a cashier at the Krusty Krab restaurant, a job that he is apathetic towards.\n\nThe character's critical reception from professionals and fans has been positive. Squidward has appeared in many \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" publications, toys, and other merchandise. He appears in the 2004 full-length feature film \"The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie\" and , which was released in 2015.\n\nSquidward is depicted as a bitter, very unfortunate, desperate, somewhat depressed, curt, arrogant, occasionally selfish, turquoise octopus. He lives in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom in a moai situated between SpongeBob SquarePants' pineapple house and Patrick Star's rock. Squidward detests his neighbors for their perpetual laughter and boisterous behavior, though SpongeBob and Patrick are oblivious to Squidward's animosity towards them and regard him as a friend.\n\nSquidward lives in a constant state of self-pity and misery; he is unhappy with his humdrum lifestyle and yearns for celebrity status, wealth, hair, and a glamorous and distinguished career as a musician or painter with a passion for art and playing the clarinet. However, he is left to endure the lowly status as a fast-food cashier at the Krusty Krab restaurant. Squidward resents his job and is irritated by his greedy employer Mr. Krabs and by having his own resented neighbor SpongeBob as a colleague.\n\nSquidward longs for peace but his wishes remain unsatisfied. He believes he is talented and deserves a higher social status, but despite having a love for music, Squidward has no talent for playing the clarinet.\n\nStephen Hillenburg first became fascinated with the ocean and began developing his artistic abilities as a child. During college, he majored in marine biology and minored in art. After graduating in 1984, he joined the Ocean Institute, an ocean education organization, where he had the idea to create a comic book titled \"The Intertidal Zone\", which led to the creation of \"SpongeBob SquarePants\". In 1987, Hillenburg left the Institute to pursue a career in animation.\nSeveral years after studying experimental animation at the California Institute of the Arts, Hillenburg met Joe Murray, creator of \"Rocko's Modern Life\", at an animation festival. Murray offered Hillenburg a job as a director of the series. Martin Olson, one of the writers for \"Rocko's Modern Life\", read \"The Intertidal Zone\" and encouraged Hillenburg to create a television series with a similar concept. At that point, Hillenburg had not considered creating his own series, but soon realized that this was his chance. Shortly after production on \"Rocko's Modern Life\" ended in 1996, Hillenburg began working on \"SpongeBob SquarePants\".\n\nHillenburg used some character designs from his comic book. He designed \"SpongeBob's grumpy next door neighbor\" as an octopus because the species' large head; octopuses, he said, \"have such a large bulbous head and Squidward thinks he's an intellectual so of course, he's gonna have a large bulbous head.\" Hillenburg drew Squidward with six tentacles because \"it was really just simpler for animation to draw him with six legs instead of eight\". Show writer and storyboard artist Vincent Waller said: Squidward is hard to drawhe has a very odd-shaped head. Fortunately, his emotions are pretty even, but to get a whole lot of big emoting out of him is a challenge. His nose splits everything in half, so it's always like, 'OK, how am I going to work this and still make it read?' Hillenburg thought of making jokes with Squidward ejecting ink but retired it because, according to him, \"it always looks like he's pooping his pants\". However, it occurs in \"\" and the sixth season episode, \"Giant Squidward\".\n\nConflicting statements from Hillenburg and Nickelodeon's official website have led to some doubt over whether the character is an octopus or a squid. Hillenburg named him Squidward because the name Octowardin the words of Squidward's voice actor Rodger Bumpass\"just didn't work\". The sound of Squidward's footsteps is produced by rubbing hot water bottles. The footsteps, and those of the rest of the main characters, are recorded by the show's foley crew. Sound designer Jeff Hutchins said that footstep sounds \"[help] tell which character it is and what surface they're stepping on\". Bumpass inspired the idea of having Squidward ride a recumbent bicycle; Bumpass owns one of these bicycles, which he rides around Burbank, California. Bumpass described it as his \"little inside joke\".\n\nSquidward's voice is provided by actor Rodger Bumpass, who voices several other \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" characters, including Squidward's mother. While creating the show and writing its pilot episode in 1997, Hillenburg and the show's then-creative director Derek Drymon were also conducting voice auditions. Mr. Lawrence, who had worked with Hillenburg and Drymon on \"Rocko's Modern Life\", was Hillenburg's first choice for the role. Hillenburg had invited Lawrence to audition for all the show's characters. Instead of Squidward, Hillenburg decided to give Lawrence the part of Plankton, the series' villain.\n\nAccording to Bumpass, Squidward was \"a very nasally, monotone kind of guy\". He said the character became interesting to perform because of \"his sarcasm, and then his frustration, and then his apoplexy, and so he became a wide spectrum of emotions\". Tom Kenny, the voice of SpongeBob, describes Bumpass recording his lines in the studio, saying, \"I love watching Rodger ... He's right next to me\". According to Kenny, when Bumpass \"goes apoplectic\" as Squidward while recording, his head turns red, \"and you're afraid he's going to have an embolism\".\n\nSeveral of the show's crew praise Bumpass for his performance and similitude to the character. Kenny called Bumpass \"brilliant\" and said, \"[he] is sort of like Squidward\". Staff writer Kent Osborne said, \"I remember thinking about how much Rodger talks and acts like Squidward. That's why it's such a good voice—he's so connected to it\". However, Bumpass said, \"I'm not him and he's not me, but what I'm required to do for him and what I am enabled to do for him is what makes it like me. It fits my particular talents and skills very well. So in that respect, yeah, he is me, but I am not the cranky, sarcastic, underachieving kind of guy that he is. He's easy to fall in, I will say that.\"\n\nSquidward's voice has been compared to that of Jack Benny's. Kenny said, \"To me, there's something just so funny about that Jack-Benny-loyal-to-nobody character that Rodger Bumpass does such a great job of playing [...] Squidward\". Arthur Brown, author of \"Everything I Need to Know, I Learned from Cartoons!\", said that Squidward \"sounds a lot like Jack Benny\". Bumpass repudiated the relationship, saying \"Jack Benny, no. Although he does have this observational sarcasm he occasionally brought out.\"\n\nSquidward has received positive reception from critics and fans. SpongeBob's voice actor Tom Kenny named Squidward his favorite character on the show. He said, \"He has an extra dimension where SpongeBob and Patrick's capacity of play mystifies him, but he's also jealous of it. When he tries to participate, he just fails utterly because he doesn't believe in it.\" Staff writer Casey Alexander said, \"Squidward is the character I relate to the most. In an exaggerated way, he's the most human character. If I knew a human like SpongeBob, I probably would react to him like Squidward does\". American singer Pharrell Williams, who says he is a fan of the show, said that \"Squidward is my favorite, though. If he was a human, I would hang out with him.\"\n\nBill Treadway of DVD Verdict said that Squidward is \"a cross between Bert [of \"Sesame Street\"], Woody Allen, and Roger Addison [of \"Mr. Ed\"] ... but he has some heart, if you can find it\". Treadway called him \"the straight man for his neighbor's antics\". Film critic A. O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" said, in his review of \"The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie\", that Squidward is one of his favorite secondary characters on the show, along with Sandy Cheeks and Mrs. Puff. He wrote, \"I was sorry to see [them] pushed to the margins\". Also from the same publication, television critic Joyce Millman said that Squidward has \"the nasal bitchiness of Paul Lynde and the artistic pretensions of Felix Unger.\" Millman further wrote, \"Hmmm, Squidward is one gay squid, I think.\"\n\n\"Band Geeks\", a second season episode that focuses on Squidward, is often considered by many critics and fans alike as one of the show's best episodes. Writing for \"The Washington Post\", Michael Cavna ranked \"Band Geeks\" as the fifth best episode of \"SpongeBob SquarePants\". In his review, Cavna said, \"Squidward's mix of artistic aspiration in the face of goading, humiliation and unrelenting sub-mediocrity made this a kids' episode that adults can experience on a whole 'nother level.\" On a less positive note, Squidward was listed among Common Sense Media's \"10 Worst TV Role Models of 2012\". Author Sierra Filucci said that the character's selfishness is his \"worst offense\", called Squidward \"the mean and nasty cashier at the Krusty Krab\" and said that \"[he] is nice only when he wants something\".\n\nAt the 39th Daytime Emmy Awards in 2012, Bumpass was nominated for his vocal performance as Squidward in the Outstanding Performer in the Animated Program categorythe first cast member to be nominated in this category. The award was won by June Foray of \"The Garfield Show\". Bumpass has said he was proud of the certificate he received for the nomination, but \"there wasn't really a competition because one of the other nominees was June Foray and she is royalty in the animation world ... There was no way any of the other three guys had a chance. In fact, if any of us had one, there would have been a riot in that studio .\" He said he was \"happy to lose to June Foray\" and \"very pleased and grateful to get a nomination\".\n\nSquidward has been included in various \"SpongeBob SquarePants\"-related merchandise, including board games, books, plush toys, and trading cards. Alongside the television series, Squidward appears in issues of \"SpongeBob Comics\" (which were first published in February 2011), in many \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" video games, and in various theme parks and theme park parades (including Sea World and Universal's Superstar Parade, respectively). In 2004, Squidward appeared in the first feature-length film adaptation of the show, \"The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie\", which was released on November 19, 2004, and was financially successful, grossing over worldwide. He also appears in , which was released in theaters on February 6, 2015.\n\nThe episode \"The Sponge Who Could Fly\" was adapted in 2009 as a stage musical at the Liverpool Empire Theatre, and later in South Africa. Actor Charles Brunton originated the role of Squidward, later recalling that he loved the character, and the \"fun [of] trying to re-create a well established cartoon character into a live performance on stage.\" Brunton prepared for the role by buying nine DVDs of the series, acting out Squidward's part in each episode, in his bedroom. He said, \"it took ages to perfect the voice and the way he used his arms\". Brunton's performance and the musical were well received by most critics. A critic from \"The Public Reviews\" wrote, \"Charles Brunton as Squidward really stole the show for us, his character was nailed to perfection, from his comic acting, voice and mannerisms this was a faultless performance\". In his review for \"The Northern Echo\", Viv Hardwick said, \"Charles Brunton makes a convincing Squidward\". The role was played by Chris van Rensburg in South Africa.\n"}
{"id": "26342598", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26342598", "title": "The Autobiography of Malcolm X", "text": "The Autobiography of Malcolm X\n\nThe Autobiography of Malcolm X was published in 1965, the result of a collaboration between human rights activist Malcolm X and journalist Alex Haley. Haley coauthored the autobiography based on a series of in-depth interviews he conducted between 1963 and Malcolm X's 1965 assassination. The \"Autobiography\" is a spiritual conversion narrative that outlines Malcolm X's philosophy of black pride, black nationalism, and pan-Africanism. After the leader was killed, Haley wrote the book's epilogue. He described their collaborative process and the events at the end of Malcolm X's life.\n\nWhile Malcolm X and scholars contemporary to the book's publication regarded Haley as the book's ghostwriter, modern scholars tend to regard him as an essential collaborator. They say he intentionally muted his authorial voice to create the effect of Malcolm X speaking directly to readers. Haley influenced some of Malcolm X's literary choices. For example, Malcolm X left the Nation of Islam during the period when he was working on the book with Haley. Rather than rewriting earlier chapters as a polemic against the Nation which Malcolm X had rejected, Haley persuaded him to favor a style of \"suspense and drama\". According to Manning Marable, \"Haley was particularly worried about what he viewed as Malcolm X's anti-Semitism\" and he rewrote material to eliminate it.\n\nWhen the \"Autobiography\" was published, \"The New York Times\" reviewer described it as a \"brilliant, painful, important book\". In 1967, historian John William Ward wrote that it would become a classic American autobiography. In 1998, \"Time\" named \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\" as one of ten \"required reading\" nonfiction books. James Baldwin and Arnold Perl adapted the book as a film; their screenplay provided the source material for Spike Lee's 1992 film \"Malcolm X\".\n\nPublished posthumously, \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\" is an account of the life of Malcolm X, born Malcolm Little (1925–1965), who became a human rights activist. Beginning with his mother's pregnancy, the book describes Malcolm's childhood in Michigan, the death of his father under questionable circumstances, and his mother's deteriorating mental health that resulted in her commitment to a psychiatric hospital. Little's young adulthood in Boston and New York City is covered, as well as his involvement in organized crime. This led to his arrest and subsequent eight- to ten-year prison sentence, of which he served six-and-a-half years (1946–1952). The book addresses his ministry with Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam (1952–1963) and his emergence as the organization's national spokesman. It documents his disillusionment with and departure from the Nation of Islam in March 1964, his pilgrimage to Mecca, which catalyzed his conversion to orthodox Sunni Islam, and his travels in Africa. Malcolm X was assassinated in New York's Audubon Ballroom in February 1965, before they finished the book. His co-author, journalist Alex Haley, summarizes the last days of Malcolm X's life, and describes in detail their working agreement, including Haley's personal views on his subject, in the \"Autobiography\"s epilogue.\n\nThe \"Autobiography\" is a spiritual conversion narrative that outlines Malcolm X's philosophy of black pride, black nationalism, and pan-Africanism. Literary critic Arnold Rampersad and Malcolm X biographer Michael Eric Dyson agree that the narrative of the \"Autobiography\" resembles the Augustinian approach to confessional narrative. Augustine's \"Confessions\" and \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\" both relate the early hedonistic lives of their subjects, document deep philosophical change for spiritual reasons, and describe later disillusionment with religious groups their subjects had once revered. Haley and autobiographical scholar Albert E. Stone compare the narrative to the Icarus myth. Author Paul John Eakin and writer Alex Gillespie suggest that part of the \"Autobiography\"s rhetorical power comes from \"the vision of a man whose swiftly unfolding career had outstripped the possibilities of the traditional autobiography he had meant to write\", thus destroying \"the illusion of the finished and unified personality\".\n\nIn addition to functioning as a spiritual conversion narrative, \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\" also reflects generic elements from other distinctly American literary forms, from the Puritan conversion narrative of Jonathan Edwards and the secular self-analyses of Benjamin Franklin, to the African American slave narratives. This aesthetic decision on the part of Malcolm X and Haley also has profound implications for the thematic content of the work, as the progressive movement between forms that is evidenced in the text reflects the personal progression of its subject. Considering this, the editors of the \"Norton Anthology of African American Literature\" assert that, \"Malcolm's \"Autobiography\" takes pains to interrogate the very models through which his persona achieves gradual self-understanding...his story's inner logic defines his life as a quest for an authentic mode of being, a quest that demands a constant openness to new ideas requiring fresh kinds of expression.\"\n\nHaley coauthored \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\", and also performed the basic functions of a ghostwriter and biographical amanuensis, writing, compiling, and editing the \"Autobiography\" based on more than 50 in-depth interviews he conducted with Malcolm X between 1963 and his subject's 1965 assassination. The two first met in 1959, when Haley wrote an article about the Nation of Islam for \"Reader's Digest\", and again when Haley interviewed Malcolm X for \"Playboy\" in 1962.\n\nIn 1963 the Doubleday publishing company asked Haley to write a book about the life of Malcolm X. American writer and literary critic Harold Bloom writes, \"When Haley approached Malcolm with the idea, Malcolm gave him a startled look ...\" Haley recalls, \"It was one of the few times I have ever seen him uncertain.\" After Malcolm X was granted permission from Elijah Muhammad, he and Haley commenced work on the \"Autobiography\", a process which began as two-and three-hour interview sessions at Haley's studio in Greenwich Village. Bloom writes, \"Malcolm was critical of Haley's middle-class status, as well as his Christian beliefs and twenty years of service in the U.S. Military.\"\n\nWhen work on the \"Autobiography\" began in early 1963, Haley grew frustrated with Malcolm X's tendency to speak only about Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam. Haley reminded him that the book was supposed to be about Malcolm X, not Muhammad or the Nation of Islam, a comment which angered Malcolm X. Haley eventually shifted the focus of the interviews toward the life of his subject when he asked Malcolm X about his mother:\nI said, 'Mr. Malcolm, could you tell me something about your mother?' And I will never, ever forget how he stopped almost as if he was suspended like a marionette. And he said, 'I remember the kind of dresses she used to wear. They were old and faded and gray.' And then he walked some more. And he said, 'I remember how she was always bent over the stove, trying to stretch what little we had.' And that was the beginning, that night, of his walk. And he walked that floor until just about daybreak.\nThough Haley is ostensibly a ghostwriter on the \"Autobiography\", modern scholars tend to treat him as an essential and core collaborator who acted as an invisible figure in the composition of the work. He minimized his own voice, and signed a contract to limit his authorial discretion in favor of producing what looked like verbatim copy. However, Malcolm X biographer Manning Marable considers this view of Haley as simply a ghostwriter as a deliberate narrative construction of black scholars of the day who wanted to see the book as a singular creation of a dynamic leader and martyr. Marable argues that a critical analysis of the \"Autobiography\", or the full relationship between Malcolm X and Haley, does not support this view; he describes it instead as a collaboration.\n\nHaley's contribution to the work is notable, and several scholars discuss how it should be characterized. In a view shared by Eakin, Stone and Dyson, psychobiographical writer Eugene Victor Wolfenstein writes that Haley performed the duties of a quasi-psychoanalytic Freudian psychiatrist and spiritual confessor. Gillespie suggests, and Wolfenstein agrees, that the act of self-narration was itself a transformative process that spurred significant introspection and personal change in the life of its subject.\n\nHaley exercised discretion over content, guided Malcolm X in critical stylistic and rhetorical choices, and compiled the work. In the epilogue to the \"Autobiography\", Haley describes an agreement he made with Malcolm X, who demanded that: \"Nothing can be in this book's manuscript that I didn't say and nothing can be left out that I want in it.\" As such, Haley wrote an addendum to the contract specifically referring to the book as an \"as told to\" account. In the agreement, Haley gained an \"important concession\": \"I asked for—and he gave—his permission that at the end of the book I could write comments of my own about him which would not be subject to his review.\" These comments became the epilogue to the \"Autobiography\", which Haley wrote after the death of his subject.\n\nIn \"Malcolm X: The Art of Autobiography\", writer and professor John Edgar Wideman examines in detail the narrative landscapes found in biography. Wideman suggests that as a writer, Haley was attempting to satisfy \"multiple allegiances\": to his subject, to his publisher, to his \"editor's agenda\", and to himself. Haley was an important contributor to the \"Autobiography\"s popular appeal, writes Wideman. Wideman expounds upon the \"inevitable compromise\" of biographers, and argues that in order to allow readers to insert themselves into the broader socio-psychological narrative, neither coauthor's voice is as strong as it could have been. Wideman details some of the specific pitfalls Haley encountered while coauthoring the \"Autobiography\":\nYou are serving many masters, and inevitably you are compromised. The man speaks and you listen but you do not take notes, the first compromise and perhaps betrayal. You may attempt through various stylistic conventions and devices to reconstitute for the reader your experience of hearing face to face the man's words. The sound of the man's narration may be represented by vocabulary, syntax, imagery, graphic devices of various sorts—quotation marks, punctuation, line breaks, visual patterning of white space and black space, markers that encode print analogs to speech—vernacular interjections, parentheses, ellipses, asterisks, footnotes, italics, dashes ...\nIn the body of the \"Autobiography\", Wideman writes, Haley's authorial agency is seemingly absent: \"Haley does so much with so little fuss ... an approach that appears so rudimentary in fact conceals sophisticated choices, quiet mastery of a medium\". Wideman argues that Haley wrote the body of the \"Autobiography\" in a manner of Malcolm X's choosing and the epilogue as an extension of the biography itself, his subject having given him carte blanche for the chapter. Haley's voice in the body of the book is a tactic, Wideman writes, producing a text nominally written by Malcolm X but seemingly written by no author. The subsumption of Haley's own voice in the narrative allows the reader to feel as though the voice of Malcolm X is speaking directly and continuously, a stylistic tactic that, in Wideman's view, was a matter of Haley's authorial choice: \"Haley grants Malcolm the tyrannical authority of an author, a disembodied speaker whose implied presence blends into the reader's imagining of the tale being told.\"\n\nIn \"Two Create One: The Act of Collaboration in Recent Black Autobiography: Ossie Guffy, Nate Shaw, and Malcolm X\", Stone argues that Haley played an \"essential role\" in \"recovering the historical identity\" of Malcolm X. Stone also reminds the reader that collaboration is a cooperative endeavor, requiring more than Haley's prose alone can provide, \"convincing and coherent\" as it may be:\nThough a writer's skill and imagination have combined words and voice into a more or less convincing and coherent narrative, the actual writer [Haley] has no large fund of memories to draw upon: the subject's [Malcolm X] memory and imagination are the original sources of the arranged story and have also come into play critically as the text takes final shape. Thus \"where\" material comes from, and \"what\" has been done to it are separable and of equal significance in collaborations.\nIn Stone's estimation, supported by Wideman, the source of autobiographical material and the efforts made to shape them into a workable narrative are distinct, and of equal value in a critical assessment of the collaboration that produced the \"Autobiography\". While Haley's skills as writer have significant influence on the narrative's shape, Stone writes, they require a \"subject possessed of a powerful memory and imagination\" to produce a workable narrative.\n\nThe collaboration between Malcolm X and Haley took on many dimensions; editing, revising and composing the \"Autobiography\" was a power struggle between two men with sometimes competing ideas of the final shape for the book. Haley \"took pains to show how Malcolm dominated their relationship and tried to control the composition of the book\", writes Rampersad. Rampersad also writes that Haley was aware that memory is selective and that autobiographies are \"almost by definition projects in fiction\", and that it was his responsibility as biographer to select material based on his authorial discretion. The narrative shape crafted by Haley and Malcolm X is the result of a life account \"distorted and diminished\" by the \"process of selection\", Rampersad suggests, yet the narrative's shape may in actuality be more revealing than the narrative itself. In the epilogue Haley describes the process used to edit the manuscript, giving specific examples of how Malcolm X controlled the language.\n\nWhile Haley ultimately deferred to Malcolm X's specific choice of words when composing the manuscript, Wideman writes, \"the nature of writing biography or autobiography ... means that Haley's promise to Malcolm, his intent to be a 'dispassionate chronicler', is a matter of disguising, not removing, his authorial presence.\" Haley played an important role in persuading Malcolm X not to re-edit the book as a polemic against Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam at a time when Haley already had most of the material needed to complete the book, and asserted his authorial agency when the \"Autobiography\"s \"fractured construction\", caused by Malcolm X's rift with Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam, \"overturned the design\" of the manuscript and created a narrative crisis. In the \"Autobiography\"s epilogue, Haley describes the incident:\nI sent Malcolm X some rough chapters to read. I was appalled when they were soon returned, red-inked in many places where he had told of his almost father-and-son relationship with Elijah Muhammad. Telephoning Malcolm X, I reminded him of his previous decisions, and I stressed that if those chapters contained such telegraphing to readers of what was to lie ahead, then the book would automatically be robbed of some of its building suspense and drama. Malcolm X said, gruffly, 'Whose book is this?' I told him 'yours, of course,' and that I only made the objection in my position as a writer. But late that night Malcolm X telephoned. 'I'm sorry. You're right. I was upset about something. Forget what I wanted changed, let what you already had stand.' I never again gave him chapters to review unless I was with him. Several times I would covertly watch him frown and wince as he read, but he never again asked for any change in what he had originally said.\n\nHaley's warning to avoid \"telegraphing to readers\" and his advice about \"building suspense and drama\" demonstrate his efforts to influence the narrative's content and assert his authorial agency while ultimately deferring final discretion to Malcolm X. In the above passage Haley asserts his authorial presence, reminding his subject that as a writer he has concerns about narrative direction and focus, but presenting himself in such a way as to give no doubt that he deferred final approval to his subject. In the words of Eakin, \"Because this complex vision of his existence is clearly not that of the early sections of the \"Autobiography\", Alex Haley and Malcolm X were forced to confront the consequences of this discontinuity in perspective for the narrative, already a year old.\" Malcolm X, after giving the matter some thought, later accepted Haley's suggestion.\n\nWhile Marable argues that Malcolm X was his own best revisionist, he also points out that Haley's collaborative role in shaping the \"Autobiography\" was notable. Haley influenced the narrative's direction and tone while remaining faithful to his subject's syntax and diction. Marable writes that Haley worked \"hundreds of sentences into paragraphs\", and organized them into \"subject areas\". Author William L. Andrews writes:\n[T]he narrative evolved out of Haley's interviews with Malcolm, but Malcolm had read Haley's typescript, and had made interlineated notes and often stipulated substantive changes, at least in the earlier parts of the text. As the work progressed, however, according to Haley, Malcolm yielded more and more to the authority of his ghostwriter, partly because Haley never let Malcolm read the manuscript unless he was present to defend it, partly because in his last months Malcolm had less and less opportunity to reflect on the text of his life because he was so busy living it, and partly because Malcolm had eventually resigned himself to letting Haley's ideas about effective storytelling take precedence over his own desire to denounce straightaway those whom he had once revered.\n\nAndrews suggests that Haley's role expanded because the book's subject became less available to micro-manage the manuscript, and \"Malcolm had eventually resigned himself\" to allowing \"Haley's ideas about effective storytelling\" to shape the narrative.\n\nMarable studied the \"Autobiography\" manuscript \"raw materials\" archived by Haley's biographer, Anne Romaine, and described a critical element of the collaboration, Haley's writing tactic to capture the voice of his subject accurately, a disjoint system of data mining that included notes on scrap paper, in-depth interviews, and long \"free style\" discussions. Marable writes, \"Malcolm also had a habit of scribbling notes to himself as he spoke.\" Haley would secretly \"pocket these sketchy notes\" and reassemble them in a sub rosa attempt to integrate Malcolm X's \"subconscious reflections\" into the \"workable narrative\". This is an example of Haley asserting authorial agency during the writing of the \"Autobiography\", indicating that their relationship was fraught with minor power struggles. Wideman and Rampersad agree with Marable's description of Haley's book-writing process.\n\nThe timing of the collaboration meant that Haley occupied an advantageous position to document the multiple conversion experiences of Malcolm X and his challenge was to form them, however incongruent, into a cohesive workable narrative. Dyson suggests that \"profound personal, intellectual, and ideological changes ... led him to order events of his life to support a mythology of metamorphosis and transformation\". Marable addresses the confounding factors of the publisher and Haley's authorial influence, passages that support the argument that while Malcolm X may have considered Haley a ghostwriter, he acted in actuality as a coauthor, at times without Malcolm X's direct knowledge or expressed consent:\nAlthough Malcolm X retained final approval of their hybrid text, he was not privy to the actual editorial processes superimposed from Haley's side. The Library of Congress held the answers. This collection includes the papers of Doubleday's then-executive editor, Kenneth McCormick, who had worked closely with Haley for several years as the Autobiography had been constructed. As in the Romaine papers, I found more evidence of Haley's sometimes-weekly private commentary with McCormick about the laborious process of composing the book. They also revealed how several attorneys retained by Doubleday closely monitored and vetted entire sections of the controversial text in 1964, demanding numerous name changes, the reworking and deletion of blocks of paragraphs, and so forth. In late 1963, Haley was particularly worried about what he viewed as Malcolm X's anti-Semitism. He therefore rewrote material to eliminate a number of negative statements about Jews in the book manuscript, with the explicit covert goal of 'getting them past Malcolm X,' without his coauthor's knowledge or consent. Thus, the censorship of Malcolm X had begun well \"prior\" to his assassination.\nMarable says the resulting text was stylistically and ideologically distinct from what Marable believes Malcolm X would have written without Haley's influence, and it also differs from what may have actually been said in the interviews between Haley and Malcolm X.\n\nIn \"Making Malcolm: The Myth and Meaning of Malcolm X\", Dyson criticizes historians and biographers of the time for re-purposing the \"Autobiography\" as a transcendent narrative by a \"mythological\" Malcolm X without being critical enough of the underlying ideas. Further, because much of the available biographical studies of Malcolm X have been written by white authors, Dyson suggests their ability to \"interpret black experience\" is suspect. \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\", Dyson says, reflects both Malcolm X's goal of narrating his life story for public consumption and Haley's political ideologies. Dyson writes, \"\"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\" ... has been criticized for avoiding or distorting certain facts. Indeed, the autobiography is as much a testament to Haley's ingenuity in shaping the manuscript as it is a record of Malcolm's attempt to tell his story.\"\nRampersad suggests that Haley understood autobiographies as \"almost fiction\". In \"The Color of His Eyes: Bruce Perry's \"Malcolm\" and Malcolm's Malcolm\", Rampersad criticizes Perry's biography, \"Malcolm: The Life of a Man Who Changed Black America\", and makes the general point that the writing of the \"Autobiography\" is part of the narrative of blackness in the 20th century and consequently should \"not be held utterly beyond inquiry\". To Rampersad, the \"Autobiography\" is about psychology, ideology, a conversion narrative, and the myth-making process. \"Malcolm inscribed in it the terms of his understanding of the form even as the unstable, even treacherous form concealed and distorted particular aspects of his quest. But there is no Malcolm untouched by doubt or fiction. Malcolm's Malcolm is in itself a fabrication; the 'truth' about him is impossible to know.\" Rampersad suggests that since his 1965 assassination, Malcolm X has \"become the desires of his admirers, who have reshaped memory, historical record and the autobiography according to their wishes, which is to say, according to their needs as they perceive them.\" Further, Rampersad says, many admirers of Malcolm X perceive \"accomplished and admirable\" figures like Martin Luther King, Jr., and W. E. B. Du Bois inadequate to fully express black humanity as it struggles with oppression, \"while Malcolm is seen as the apotheosis of black individual greatness ... he is a perfect hero—his wisdom is surpassing, his courage definitive, his sacrifice messianic\". Rampersad suggests that devotees have helped shape the myth of Malcolm X.\n\nAuthor Joe Wood writes:\n[T]he autobiography iconizes Malcolm twice, not once. Its second Malcolm—the El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz finale—is a mask with no distinct ideology, it is not particularly Islamic, not particularly nationalist, not particularly humanist. Like any well crafted icon or story, the mask is evidence of its subject's humanity, of Malcolm's strong human spirit. But both masks hide as much character as they show. The first mask served a nationalism Malcolm had rejected before the book was finished; the second is mostly empty and available.\nTo Eakin, a significant portion of the \"Autobiography\" involves Haley and Malcolm X shaping the fiction of the completed self. Stone writes that Haley's description of the \"Autobiography\"s composition makes clear that this fiction is \"especially misleading in the case of Malcolm X\"; both Haley and the \"Autobiography\" itself are \"out of phase\" with its subject's \"life and identity\". Dyson writes, \"[Louis] Lomax says that Malcolm became a 'lukewarm integrationist'. [Peter] Goldman suggests that Malcolm was 'improvising', that he embraced and discarded ideological options as he went along. [Albert] Cleage and [Oba] T'Shaka hold that he remained a revolutionary black nationalist. And [James Hal] Cone asserts that he became an internationalist with a humanist bent.\" Marable writes that Malcolm X was a \"committed internationalist\" and \"black nationalist\" at the end of his life, not an \"integrationist\", noting, \"what I find in my own research is greater continuity than discontinuity\".\n\nMarable, in \"Rediscovering Malcolm's Life: A Historian's Adventures in Living History\", critically analyzes the collaboration that produced the \"Autobiography\". Marable argues autobiographical \"memoirs\" are \"inherently biased\", representing the subject as he would appear with certain facts privileged, others deliberately omitted. Autobiographical narratives self-censor, reorder event chronology, and alter names. According to Marable, \"nearly everyone writing about Malcolm X\" has failed to critically and objectively analyze and research the subject properly. Marable suggests that most historians have assumed that the \"Autobiography\" is veritable truth, devoid of any ideological influence or stylistic embellishment by Malcolm X or Haley. Further, Marable believes the \"most talented revisionist of Malcolm X, was Malcolm X\", who actively fashioned and reinvented his public image and verbiage so as to increase favor with diverse groups of people in various situations.\n\nHaley writes that during the last months of Malcolm X's life \"uncertainty and confusion\" about his views were widespread in Harlem, his base of operations. In an interview four days before his death Malcolm X said, \"I'm man enough to tell you that I can't put my finger on exactly what my philosophy is now, but I'm flexible.\" Malcolm X had not yet formulated a cohesive Black ideology at the time of his assassination and, Dyson writes, was \"experiencing a radical shift\" in his core \"personal and political understandings\".\n\nEliot Fremont-Smith, reviewing \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\" for \"The New York Times\" in 1965, described it as \"extraordinary\" and said it is a \"brilliant, painful, important book\". Two years later, historian John William Ward wrote that the book \"will surely become one of the classics in American autobiography\". Bayard Rustin argued the book suffered from a lack of critical analysis, which he attributed to Malcolm X's expectation that Haley be a \"chronicler, not an interpreter.\" \"Newsweek\" also highlighted the limited insight and criticism in \"The Autobiography\" but praised it for power and poignance. However, Truman Nelson in \"The Nation\" lauded the epilogue as revelatory and described Haley as a \"skillful amanuensis\". \"Variety\" called it a \"mesmerizing page-turner\" in 1992, and in 1998, \"Time\" named \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\" one of ten \"required reading\" nonfiction books.\n\n\"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\" has influenced generations of readers. In 1990, Charles Solomon writes in the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"Unlike many '60s icons, \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\", with its double message of anger and love, remains an inspiring document.\" Cultural historian Howard Bruce Franklin describes it as \"one of the most influential books in late-twentieth-century American culture\", and the \"Concise Oxford Companion to African American Literature\" credits Haley with shaping \"what has undoubtedly become the most influential twentieth-century African American autobiography\".\n\nConsidering the literary impact of Malcolm X's \"Autobiography\", we may note the tremendous influence of the book, as well as its subject generally, on the development of the Black Arts Movement. Indeed, it was the day after Malcolm's assassination that the poet and playwright, Amiri Baraka, established the Black Arts Repertory Theater, which would serve to catalyze the aesthetic progression of the movement. Writers and thinkers associated with the Black Arts movement found in the \"Autobiography\" an aesthetic embodiment of his profoundly influential qualities, namely, \"the vibrancy of his public voice, the clarity of his analyses of oppression's hidden history and inner logic, the fearlessness of his opposition to white supremacy, and the unconstrained ardor of his advocacy for revolution 'by any means necessary.'\"\n\nbell hooks writes \"When I was a young college student in the early seventies, the book I read which revolutionized my thinking about race and politics was \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\".\" David Bradley adds:\n\nShe [hooks] is not alone. Ask any middle-aged socially conscious intellectual to list the books that influenced his or her youthful thinking, and he or she will most likely mention \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\". Some will do more than mention it. Some will say that ... they picked it up—by accident, or maybe by assignment, or because a friend pressed it on them—and that they approached the reading of it without great expectations, but somehow that book ... took hold of them. Got \"inside\" them. Altered their vision, their outlook, their insight. Changed their lives.\n\nMax Elbaum concurs, writing that \"\"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\" was without question the single most widely read and influential book among young people of all racial backgrounds who went to their first demonstration sometime between 1965 and 1968.\"\n\nAt the end of his tenure as the first African-American U.S. Attorney General, Eric Holder selected \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\" when asked what book he would recommend to a young person coming to Washington, D.C.\n\nDoubleday had contracted to publish \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\" and paid a $30,000 advance to Malcolm X and Haley in 1963. In March 1965, three weeks after Malcolm X's assassination, Nelson Doubleday, Jr., canceled its contract out of fear for the safety of his employees. Grove Press then published the book later that year. Since \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\" has sold millions of copies, Marable described Doubleday's choice as the \"most disastrous decision in corporate publishing history\".\n\n\"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\" has sold well since its 1965 publication. According to \"The New York Times\", the paperback edition sold 400,000 copies in 1967 and 800,000 copies the following year. The \"Autobiography\" entered its 18th printing by 1970. \"The New York Times\" reported that six million copies of the book had been sold by 1977. The book experienced increased readership and returned to the best-seller list in the 1990s, helped in part by the publicity surrounding Spike Lee's 1992 film \"Malcolm X\". Between 1989 and 1992, sales of the book increased by 300%.\n\nIn 1968 film producer Marvin Worth hired novelist James Baldwin to write a screenplay based on \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\"; Baldwin was joined by screenwriter Arnold Perl, who died in 1971 before the screenplay could be finished. Baldwin developed his work on the screenplay into the book \"One Day, When I Was Lost: A Scenario Based on Alex Haley's \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\"\", published in 1972. Other authors who attempted to draft screenplays include playwright David Mamet, novelist David Bradley, author Charles Fuller, and screenwriter Calder Willingham. Director Spike Lee revised the Baldwin-Perl script for his 1992 film \"Malcolm X\".\n\nIn 1992, attorney Gregory Reed bought the original manuscripts of \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\" for $100,000 at the sale of the Haley Estate. The manuscripts included three \"missing chapters\", titled \"The Negro\", \"The End of Christianity\", and \"Twenty Million Black Muslims\", that were omitted from the original text. In a 1964 letter to his publisher, Haley had described these chapters as, \"the most material of the book, some of it rather lava-like\". Marable writes that the missing chapters were \"dictated and written\" during Malcolm X's final months in the Nation of Islam. In them, Marable says, Malcolm X proposed the establishment of a union of African American civic and political organizations. Marable wonders whether this project might have led some within the Nation of Islam and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to try to silence Malcolm X. In April 2010, the \"New York Post\" reported that the missing chapters would be published with a foreword by Malcolm X's daughter Ilyasah Shabazz.\n\nThe book has been published in more than 45 editions and in many languages, including Arabic, German, French, Indonesian. Important editions include:\n\n\n\n"}

Ross is also a senior fellow at Columbia University, a former night-shift janitor, and a Baltimore teacher. Ross launched a campaign for the Governor of Maryland in 2017. The book explores the forces that will change the world in robotics, genetics, digital currency, coding and big data.\n\nThe Industries of the Future by Senior Policy Advisor Alec Ross explores the geopolitical, cultural and generational changes that will be driven by the key industries over the next twenty years. Ross is a Distinguished Visiting Fellow at Johns Hopkins University and was the Senior Advisor for Innovation to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. During his time as Senior Advisor for Innovation he visited forty-one countries looking at the technological advances. He has been a guest lecturer at a number of institutions including the United Nations, University of Oxford, Harvard Law School, and Stanford Business School. Ross started his career as a teacher through Teach for America and in 2000 he co-founded a technology-focused nonprofit organization called One Economy.\n\nThe book explores several industries including robotics, genetics, coding and big data. Ross explores how advances in robotics and life sciences will change the way we live—robots, artificial intelligence and machine learning will have impact on our lives. According to Ross, dramatic advances in life sciences will increase our life expectancy—but not all will benefit from such changes. Ross spends time exploring \"Code\" and how the codefication of money and also weapons (computer security) will both benefit and potentially disrupt our international economies. Ross also looks at how data will be \"the raw material of the information age.\"\n\nRoss also focuses on globalization and geopolitical economics. He explores how competitiveness and how societies, families and individuals will need to thrive. Ross gives attention to the importance of women stating that \"the states and societies that do the most for women are those that will be best positioned to compete and succeed in the industries of the future.\" The book also touches on how to prepare children for \"success in a world of increasing change and competition.\"\n\nRoss discusses the shift of robotics from being manual and repetitive to cognitive and non-repetitive. He believes that breakthroughs in mathematical modeling and cloud robotics (machine learning and Artificial Intelligence) make robotics acceptable. In the book Ross describes how other cultures have different reactions to robotics and he uses Japan's use of robotics in elder-care as an example. He also expects that less developed countries may be able to leapfrog technologies in robotics much like they did with cell and mobile technologies.\n\nAccording to Ross, the last trillion dollar industry was created out of computer code; the next trillion dollar industry will be created out of genome code. In the book Ross describes how genome code is already being used to fix humans from curing cancer to hacking the brain to growing organs. He also describes the difference between the United States investment in genome research with that of China.\n\nRoss then turns to the \"code-ification\" of money, markets and trust. He describes the transition from cash to mobile and online banking. He also discusses the sharing economy from eBay to AirBnB and then gives an overview of BitCoin and blockchain technology. Ross also focuses on cybersecurity and the weaponization of code with a focus on a move from cold war to \"code war.\" Ross states that he expects the total market size of the cyberindustry to reach $175 billion by the end of 2017.\n\nAlec Ross has said that he intended to give a balanced point of view with the book that it is neither a Utopian or Dystopian vision of the future which is why he opened the book with the struggles he witnessed growing up in West Virginia. On writing the book Ross said that he knows his parents would have wanted a book like this in the sixties that would describe what globalization would do and he wished that he had a book like this when he graduated from college that would have explored the Internet and digitization on the economy.\n\nThe editors for the book were Jonathan Karp and Jonathan Cox of Simon & Schuster.\n\n\"The Industries of the Future\" has received mainly positive reviews from the likes of \"Forbes\", \"New York Journal of Books\", and \"Financial Times\". \"Forbes\" contributor Peter Decherney said the book \"reads like a portable TED conference at which you've been seated next to the smartest guy in the room.\" The book was also listed on the Forbes list—\"16 New Books for Leaders to Begin in 2016\". Tara D. Sonenshine in the \"New York Journal of Books\" called the book a good place to start \"if you want to know how to survive and thrive in the fast-paced world of today and how to anticipate the opportunities of tomorrow's information age.\" Sonenshine also called out the book for focusing on women and multiculturalism. In an article titled \"Is predicting the future futile or necessary?\" by Stephen Cave in the \"Financial Times\" is more critical, saying that Ross focuses on industries with already considerable coverage and investment but Cave points out that \"rarely can the future be predicted by extending current trajectories.\"\n\nThe following trends are covered in the book:\n"}

(including the formation of Section 28 Local Government Act.) Declaring it a homophobic and repressive totalitarian state. In 1986, Jarman was also diagnosed with AIDS and had just finished his 'masterpiece', \"Caravaggio\", so the film is a confluence of angry imagination.\nIt is named after a painting by the artist Ford Madox Brown. The painting and the film, share themes of escape and the changing of place.\n\nHe uses a shaky hand-held camera to cause anxiety and paranoia, and the ever-present melancholy is expressed in the extracts from poems, including T.S. Eliot's \"The Hollow Men\" and Allen Ginsberg's \"Howl\", which are monotonously read by narrator Nigel Terry.\n\nIn one of the film’s most famous scenes, is of Tilda Swinton, dressed not unlike the woman from Brown’s painting, as a bride mourning her executed husband, screaming and letting out a primal cry whilst rubbish burns around her and it was shot near the director’s home on the beach of Dungeness, Kent.\n\nOther images in the film, are counterpointed by Bach violin sonatas and 1980s disco. Skulls, fire and ashes embody death and destruction, while scenes of sex on a Union Jack flag and 'Spring' masturbating show a disregard for social conventions and suggest a country in a state of chaos and sordid decadence.\n\n\nDerek Jarman received the 1988 Teddy Award in Berlin for the film. Also Tilda Swinton received the jury prize for her performance in the film.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, it has an average score of 68%, based on 3 reviews.\n\n'What proof do you need the world's curling up like an autumn leaf?' is \"Time Out\" magazine's review.\n\n\"Terrible\" is David Bezanson's review, \"Impressionistic\" doesn't have to mean \"bad\" and \"It's graphic and disorienting, yet also totally trite\".\n\nJarman wrote a book to accompany the film, which deals more explicitly with the relationship he had with his father, who was a Lancaster bomber pilot in the Second World War. Jarman used the impact of his father's despair, depression and violence on his own artistic vision. The depression that his father suffered is attributed to the high number of fatalities that bomber crews experienced and the carpet-bombing of civilians. \n\nThe book and to a lesser extent the film are very much in the tradition of Roland Barthes \"Camera Lucida\", Susan Sontag's \"On Photography\", Jeanette Winterson's 'Art Objects' and to a lesser extent John Berger's \"Ways of Seeing\" in that he has used the deeply familiar and personal as a vehicle for dialogue about art and contemporary culture.\n\n"}

Wallis would later characterise this as \"one of the most controversial papers\" in rock art research.\n\nLewis-Williams opens \"The Mind in the Cave\" with a preface, in which he outlines the methodology that he is working with, and emphasises his position that \"we do not have to explain everything to explain something\". what he calls \"Three Caves: Three Time-Bytes\", brief page-long narratives set in the Upper Palaeolithic sites of the Volp Caves, the Niaux Cave and Chauvet Cave.\n\nIn the first chapter, entitled \"Discovering Human Antiquity\", Lewis-Williams explores the early scholarly understanding of Upper Palaeolithic art, stemming from the increased interest in the origins of the human species sparked by the publication of Charles Darwin's \"On the Origin of Species\". He proceeds to discuss early attempts to analyse both portable and parietal art, and the early belief that cave paintings were forgeries, being too sophisticated to have been produced by \"primitive\" humans, before scholars eventually came to accept their authenticity. Finally, he notes the developments in radiocarbon dating, which enabled far more accurate dating of archaeological sites, allowing scholars to appreciate the exact antiquity of the Upper Palaeolithic.\n\nChapter two, \"Seeking Answers\", proceeds to examine the various different interpretative approaches that scholars have taken to the Upper Palaeolithic cave art of Europe. Noting the problems innate with using the term \"art\", he nevertheless believes it can still be used in this context with caution. From there, he looks at the early claims that rejected symbolic-religious explanations, instead adopting an \"art for art's sake\" approach, and then its fall from academic credibility. He then discusses the claims that the artworks did have symbolic meanings, being either totemic or representative of sympathetic magic, both arguments made from ethnographic parallels with modern hunter-gatherer communities such as those of Australia. Lewis-Williams goes on to discuss structuralist interpretations of the artworks, such as those first advocated by Giambattista Vico and Ferdinand de Saussure, and later reformulated by the likes of Max Raphael, Annette Laming-Emperaire and André Leroi-Gourhan.\n\nArchaeologist Robert J. Wallis reviewed \"The Mind in the Cave\" for the \"Journal for the Academic Study of Magic\". Proclaiming it to be \"a timely introduction\" to a shamanistic interpretation of Upper Palaeolithic rock art, Wallis believed that Lewis-Davidson puts forward \"a compelling case\" for the nature of such cave paintings. Although he had some reservations, he noted that the book established the shamanistic interpretation as being the \"forefront\" of rock art research. He ended his review by mentioning the manner in which Lewis-Williams ended the book by emphasising that there is no reason for contemporary people to be shamans; himself a Neoshaman, Wallis noted that Lewis-Williams might be concerned that \"his work will inspire neo-Shamanism rather than rational materialism\", but proceeded to express his opinion that even if it did so, it would \"be none the worse for that.\"\n\nWriting in his opening paper, \"Agency, Intellect and the Archaeological Agenda\", published in the academic anthology \"Signals of Belief in Early England: Anglo-Saxon Paganism Revisited\" (2010), the archaeologist Martin Carver praised Lewis-Williams' book, describing it as \"stimulating\" and remarking that it had \"redefined the world of early spirituality for archaeologists\". Considering Lewis-Williams' case to be \"persuasive\", Carver felt that the theories contained within it could be used to shine light on the world of Anglo-Saxon paganism.\n\n\n"}

Rowling's Wizarding World) is a fantasy media franchise and shared fictional universe centred on a series of films, based on the \"Harry Potter\" novels by British author J. K. Rowling. The films have been in production since 2000, and in that time ten films have been produced—eight are adaptations of the \"Harry Potter\" novels and two are part of the \"Fantastic Beasts\" franchise. The films are owned and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, and three more are in various stages of production. The series has collectively grossed over $9 billion at the global box office, making it the third-highest-grossing film franchise of all-time.\n\nDavid Heyman and his company Heyday Films have produced every film in the Wizarding World. Chris Columbus and Mark Radcliffe served as producers on \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\", David Barron began producing the films with the 2007 film \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" and ending with \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2\" in 2011, and Rowling produced the final two films in the \"Harry Potter\" series. Heyman, Rowling, Steve Kloves and Lionel Wigram have produced both films in the \"Fantastic Beasts\" series. The films are written and directed by several individuals and feature large, often ensemble, casts. Many of the actors, including Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and Eddie Redmayne, star in numerous films. Soundtrack albums have been released for each of the films. The franchise also includes a stage production, a digital publication, a video game label and The Wizarding World of Harry Potter–themed areas at several Universal Parks & Resorts amusement parks around the world.\n\nThe first film in the Wizarding World was \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" (2001), which was followed by seven \"Harry Potter\" sequels, beginning with \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\" in 2002, and ending with \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2\" in 2011, nearly ten years after the first film's release. \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\" (2016) is the first film in the spin-off prequel \"Fantastic Beasts\" series. A sequel, titled \"\", has been released in November 2018, while three additional instalments have been announced, including one scheduled for 2020.\n\nHarry Potter, a seemingly ordinary eleven-year-old boy, is actually a wizard and survivor of Lord Voldemort's attempted rise to power. Harry is rescued from his unkind Muggle relatives and takes his place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger become entangled in the mystery of the Philosopher's Stone, which is being kept within the school.\n\nIn October 1998, Warner Bros. purchased the film rights to the first four novels of the \"Harry Potter\" fantasy series by J. K. Rowling for a seven-figure sum, after a pitch from producer David Heyman. Warner Bros. took particular notice of Rowling's wishes and thoughts about the films when drafting her contract. One of her principal stipulations was that they be shot in Britain with an all-British cast, which has been generally adhered to. On 8 August 2000, the virtually unknown Daniel Radcliffe and newcomers Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were selected to play Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Chris Columbus was hired to direct the film adaptation of \"Philosopher's Stone,\" with Steve Kloves selected to write the screenplay. Filming began on 29 September 2000 at Leavesden Film Studios and concluded on 23 March 2001, with final work being done in July. Principal photography took place on 2 October 2000 at North Yorkshire's Goathland railway station. Warner Bros. had initially planned to release the film over 4 July 2001 weekend, making for such a short production window that several proposed directors removed themselves from consideration. Because of time constraints, the date was put back, and \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" was released in the United Kingdom and the United States on 16 November 2001.\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione return to Hogwarts for their second year, but a mysterious chamber, hidden in the school, is opened leaving students and ghosts petrified by an unknown agent. They must solve the mystery of the chamber, and discover its entrance to find and defeat the true culprit.\n\nColumbus and Kloves returned as director, and screenwriter for the film adaptation of \"Chamber of Secrets\". Just three days after the wide release of the first film, production began on 19 November 2001 in Surrey, England, with filming continuing on location on the Isle of Man and at several other locations in Great Britain. Leavesden Film Studios in London made several scenes for Hogwarts. Principal photography concluded in the summer of 2002. The film spent until early October in post-production. \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\" premiered in the United Kingdom on 3 November 2002 before its wide release on 15 November, one year after the \"Philosopher's Stone\".\n\nA mysterious convict, Sirius Black, escapes from Azkaban and sets his sights on Hogwarts, where dementors are stationed to protect Harry and his peers. Harry learns more about his past and his connection with the escaped prisoner.\n\nColumbus, the director of the two previous films, decided not to return to helm the third instalment, but remained as a producer alongside Heyman. Warner Bros. then drew up a three-name, short list for Columbus' replacement, which comprised Callie Khouri, Kenneth Branagh (who played Gilderoy Lockhart in \"Chamber of Secrets\") and the eventual director Alfonso Cuarón. Cuarón was initially nervous about accepting the job having not read any of the books, or seen the films, but later signed on after reading the series and connecting immediately with the story. Michael Gambon replaced Richard Harris, who played Albus Dumbledore in the previous two films, after Harris's death in October 2002. Gambon was unconcerned with bettering or copying Harris, instead provided his own interpretation, including using a slight Irish accent for the role. He completed his scenes in three weeks. Gary Oldman was cast in the key role of Sirius Black in February 2003. Principal photography began on 24 February 2003, at Leavesden Film Studios, and concluded in October 2003. \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\" premiered on 23 May 2004 in New York. It was released in the United Kingdom on 31 May, and in the United States on 4 June. It was the first film in the series to be released in both conventional and IMAX theatres.\n\nAfter the Quidditch World Cup, Harry arrives back at Hogwarts and finds himself entered in the Triwizard Tournament, a challenging competition involving completing three dangerous tasks. Harry is forced to compete with three other wizards chosen by the Goblet of Fire Fleur Delacour, Viktor Krum, and Cedric Diggory.\n\nIn August 2003, British film director Mike Newell was chosen to direct the film after \"Prisoner of Azkaban\" director Alfonso Cuarón announced that he would not direct the sequel. Heyman returned to produce, and Kloves again wrote the screenplay. Principal photography began on 4 May 2004. Scenes involving the film's principal actors began shooting on 25 June 2004 at England's Leavesden Film Studios. \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" premiered on 6 November 2005 in London, and was released in the United Kingdom and the United States on 18 November. \"Goblet of Fire\" was the first film in the series to receive a PG-13 rating by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) for \"sequences of fantasy violence and frightening images,\" M by the Australian Classification Board (ACB), and a 12A by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) for its dark themes, fantasy violence, threat and frightening images.\n\nHarry returns for his fifth year at Hogwarts and discovers that the Wizarding World is in denial of Voldemort's return. He takes matters into his own hands and starts a secret organisation to stand up against the regime of Hogwarts' \"High Inquisitor\" Dolores Umbridge, as well as to learn practical Defence Against the Dark Arts (D.A.D.A) for the forthcoming battle.\n\nDaniel Radcliffe confirmed he would return as Harry Potter in May 2005, with Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Matthew Lewis (Neville Longbottom), and Bonnie Wright (Ginny Weasley) confirmed to return in November 2005. In February 2006, Helen McCrory was cast as Bellatrix Lestrange, but dropped out due to her pregnancy. In May 2006, Helena Bonham Carter was cast in her place. Ralph Fiennes reprises his role as Lord Voldemort. British television director David Yates was chosen to direct the film after \"Goblet of Fire\" director Newell, as well as Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Guillermo del Toro, Matthew Vaughn and Mira Nair, turned down offers. Kloves, the screenwriter of the first four Harry \"Potter\" films, had other commitments and Michael Goldenberg, who had been considered for screenwriter of the series' first film, filled in to write the script. Principal photography began on 7 February 2006, and concluded at the start of December 2006. Filming was put on a two-month hiatus starting in May 2006 so Radcliffe could sit his A/S Levels and Watson could sit her GCSE exams. Live-action filming took place in England and Scotland for exterior locations and at Leavesden Film Studios for interior locations. \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" had its world premiere on 28 June 2007 in Tokyo, Japan, and a UK premiere on 3 July 2007 at the Odeon Leicester Square in London. The film was released in the United Kingdom on 12 July, and the United States on 11 July.\n\nVoldemort and his Death Eaters are increasing their terror upon the Wizarding and Muggle worlds. Needing him for an important reason, Headmaster Dumbledore persuades his old friend Horace Slughorn to return to his prior post at Hogwarts. During Slughorn's Potions class, Harry takes possession of a strangely annotated school textbook, previously owned by the \"Half-Blood Prince\".\n\nIn July 2007, it was announced that Yates would return as director. Kloves returned to write the screenplay after skipping out of the fifth film, with Heyman and David Barron back as producers. Watson considered not returning for the film, but eventually signed on after Warner Bros. moved the production schedule to accommodate her exam dates. Principal photography began on 24 September 2007, and concluded on 17 May 2008. Though Radcliffe, Gambon and Jim Broadbent (Slughorn) started shooting in late September 2007, other cast members started much later: Watson did not begin until December 2007, Alan Rickman (Severus Snape) until January 2008, and Bonham Carter until February 2008. \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" had its world premiere on 6 July 2009 in Tokyo, Japan, and was released in the United Kingdom and the United States on 15 July.\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione leave Hogwarts behind and set out to find and destroy Lord Voldemort's secret to immortality – the Horcruxes. The trio undergo a long journey with many obstacles in their path including Death Eaters, Snatchers, the mysterious Deathly Hallows, and Harry's connection with the Dark Lord's mind becoming ever stronger.\n\nOriginally scheduled for a single theatrical release, on 13 March 2008, Warner Bros. announced that the film adaptation of \"Deathly Hallows\" would be split into two parts to do justice to the book and out of respect for its fans. Yates, director of the previous two films, was confirmed to return as director, and Kloves was confirmed as screenwriter. For the first time in the series, Rowling was credited as a producer alongside Heyman and Barron, however Yates noted that her participation in the filmmaking process did not change from the previous films. Pre-production began on 26 January 2009, while principal photography began on 19 February at Leavesden Studios, where the previous six instalments were filmed. Pinewood Studios became the second studio location for shooting the seventh film. The premiere of \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1\" was held on 11 November 2010, at the Empire, Leicester Square in London, and the film was released in the United Kingdom and the United States on 19 November.\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione continue their search to find and destroy the remaining Horcruxes, as Harry prepares for the final battle against Voldemort.\n\nThe film was announced in March 2008 as \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2\", the second of two cinematic parts.
