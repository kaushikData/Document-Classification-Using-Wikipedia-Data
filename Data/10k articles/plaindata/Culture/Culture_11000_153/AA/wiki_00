This is part of a growing international movement focusing on the skills required for students to master in preparation for success in a rapidly changing, digital society. Many of these skills are also associated with deeper learning, which is based on mastering skills such as analytic reasoning, complex problem solving, and teamwork. These skills differ from traditional academic skills in that they are not primarily content knowledge-based.\n\nDuring the latter decades of the 20th century and into the 21st century, society has undergone an accelerating pace of change in economy and technology. Its effects on the workplace, and thus on the demands on the educational system preparing students for the workforce, have been significant in several ways. Beginning in the 1980s, government, educators, and major employers issued a series of reports identifying key skills and implementation strategies to steer students and workers towards meeting the demands of the changing workplace and society.\n\nThe current workforce is significantly more likely to change career fields or jobs. Those in the Baby Boom generation entered the workforce with a goal of stability; subsequent generations are more concerned with finding happiness and fulfillment in their work lives. Young workers in North America are now likely to change jobs at a much higher rate than previously, as much as once every 4.4 years on average. With this employment mobility comes a demand for different skills, ones that enable people to be flexible and adaptable in different roles or in different career fields.\n\nAs western economies have transformed from industrial-based to service-based, trades and vocations have smaller roles. However, specific hard skills and mastery of particular skill sets, with a focus on digital literacy, are in increasingly high demand. People skills that involve interaction, collaboration, and managing others are increasingly important. Skills that enable people to be flexible and adaptable in different roles or in different fields, those that involve processing information and managing people more than manipulating equipment—in an office or a factory—are in greater demand. These are also referred to as \"applied skills\" or \"soft skills\", including personal, interpersonal, or learning-based skills, such as life skills (problem-solving behaviors), people skills, and social skills. The skills have been grouped into three main areas: \n\nMany of these skills are also identified as key qualities of progressive education, a pedagogical movement that began in the late nineteenth century and continues in various forms to the present.\n\nSince the early 1980s, a variety of governmental, academic, non-profit, and corporate entities have conducted considerable research to identify key personal and academic skills and competencies they determined were needed for the current and next generation. The identification and implementation of 21st century skills into education and workplaces began in the United States but has spread to Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and through national and international organizations such as APEC and the OECD.\n\nIn 1981, the US Secretary of Education created the National Commission on Excellence in Education to examine the quality of education in the United States.\" The commission issued its report \"A Nation at Risk: The Imperative for Educational Reform\" in 1983. A key finding was that \"educational reform should focus on the goal of creating a Learning Society.\" The report's recommendations included instructional content and skills:\n\nFive New Basics: English, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, Computer Science\nOther Curriculum Matters: Develop proficiency, rigor, and skills in Foreign Languages, Performing Arts, Fine Arts, Vocational Studies, and the pursuit of higher level education.\nSkills and abilities (consolidated):\n\nUntil the dawn of the 21st century, education systems across the world focussed on preparing their students to accumulate content and knowledge. As a result, schools focussed on providing literacy and numeracy skills to their students, as these skills were perceived as necessary to gain content and knowledge. Recent developments in technology and telecommunication have made information and knowledge ubiquitous and easily accessible in the 21st century. Therefore, while skills such as literacy and numeracy are still relevant and necessary, they are no longer sufficient. In order to respond to technological, demographic and socio-economic changes, education systems began to make the shift toward providing their students with a range of skills that relied not only on cognition but also on the interdependencies of cognitive, social, and emotional characteristics. \n\nNotable efforts were conducted by the US Secretary of Labor's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS), a national coalition called the Partnership for 21st Century Skills (P21), the international Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the American Association of College and Universities, researchers at MIT and other institutions of higher learning, and private organizations.\n\nAdditional research has found that the top skills demanded by U.S. Fortune 500 companies by the year 2000 had shifted from traditional reading, writing and arithmetic to teamwork, problem solving, and interpersonal skills. A 2006 Conference Board survey of some 400 employers revealed that the most important skills for new workforce entrants included oral and written communications and critical thinking/problem solving, ahead of basic knowledge and skills, such as the reading comprehension and mathematics. While the ‘three Rs’ were still considered foundational to new workforce entrants’ abilities, employers emphasized that applied skills like collaboration/teamwork and critical thinking were ‘very important’ to success at work.\"\n\nA 2006 report from MIT researchers countered the suggestion that students acquire critical skills and competencies independently by interacting with popular culture, noting three continuing trends that suggest the need for policy and pedagogical interventions:\"\n\nAccording to labor economists at MIT and Harvard’s Graduate School of Education, the economic changes brought about over the past four decades by emerging technology and globalization, employers’ demands for people with competencies like complex thinking and communications skills has increased greatly. They argue that the success of the U.S. economy will rely on the nation’s ability to give students the \"foundational skills in problem-solving and communications that computers don’t have.\"\n\nIn 2010, the Common Core State Standards Initiative, an effort sponsored by the National Governors Association (NGA) and the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO), issued the Common Core Standards, calling for the integration of 21st century skills into K-12 curricula across the United States.\n\nThe skills and competencies that are generally considered \"21st Century skills\" are varied but share some common themes. They are based on the premise that effective learning, or deeper learning, a set of student educational outcomes including acquisition of robust core academic content, higher-order thinking skills, and learning dispositions. This pedagogy involves creating, working with others, analyzing, and presenting and sharing both the learning experience and the learned knowledge or wisdom, including to peers and mentors as well as teachers. This contrasts with more traditional learning methodology that involves learning by rote and regurgitating info/knowledge back to the teacher for a grade. The skills are geared towards students and workers to foster engagement; seeking, forging, and facilitating connections to knowledge, ideas, peers, instructors, and wider audiences; creating/producing; and presenting/publishing. The classification or grouping has been undertaken to encourage and promote pedagogies that facilitate deeper learning through both traditional instruction as well as active learning, project-based learning, problem based learning, and others. A 2012 survey conducted by the American Management Association (AMA) identified three top skills necessary for their employees: critical thinking, communication and collaboration. Below are some of the more readily identifiable lists of 21st century skills.\n\nThe Common Core Standards issued in 2010 were intended to support the \"application of knowledge through higher-order thinking skills.\" The initiative's stated goals are to promote the skills and concepts required for college and career readiness in multiple disciplines and life in the global economy. Skills identified for success in the areas of literacy and mathematics:\n\nFollowing the release of \"A Nation at Risk\", the U.S. Secretary of Labor appointed the Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS) to determine the skills needed for young people to succeed in the workplace to foster a high-performance economy. SCANS focused on what they called \"learning a living\" system. In 1991, they issued their initial report, \"What Work Requires of Schools\". The report concluded that a high-performance workplace requires workers who have key fundamental skills: basic skills and knowledge, thinking skills to apply that knowledge, personal skills to manage and perform; and five key workplace competencies.\n\nFundamental Skills\n\nWorkplace Competencies\n\nIn 2002 the Partnership for 21st Century Skills (now the Partnership for 21st Century Learning, or P21) was founded as a non-profit organization by a coalition that included members of the national business community, education leaders, and policymakers: the National Education Association (NEA), United States Department of Education, AOL Time Warner Foundation, Apple Computer, Inc., Cable in the Classroom, Cisco Systems, Inc., Dell Computer Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, SAP, Ken Kay (President and Co-Founder), and Dins Golder-Dardis. To foster a national conversation on \"the importance of 21st century skills for all students\" and \"position 21st century readiness at the center of US K-12 education\", P21 identified six key skills:\n\n7C Skills have been identified by P21 senior fellows at P21, Bernie Trilling and Charles Fadel:\n\nThe P21 organization also conducted research that identified deeper learning competencies and skills they called the Four Cs of 21st century learning:\n\nThe University of Southern California's Project New Literacies website list four different \"C\" skills: \n\nIn 2008, author and Harvard Graduate School of Education researcher Tony Wagner identified what he termed the \"7 Survival Skills\" needed for the modern workplace:\n\n\nResearchers at MIT, led by Henry Jenkins, Director of the Comparative Media Studies Program, in 2006 issued a white paper (\"Confronting the Challenges of a Participatory Culture: Media Education for the 21st Century\"), that examined digital media and learning. To address this Digital Divide, they recommended an effort be made to develop the cultural competencies and social skills required to participate fully in modern society instead of merely advocating for installing computers in each classroom. What they term participatory culture shifts this literacy from the individual level to a broader connection and involvement, with the premise that networking and collaboration develop social skills that are vital to new literacies. These in turn build on traditional foundation skills and knowledge taught in school: traditional literacy, research, technical, and critical analysis skills.\n\nParticipatory culture is defined by this study as having: low barriers to artistic expression and civic engagement, strong support for creating and sharing one’s creations, informal mentorship, belief that members' own contributions matter, and social connection (caring what other people think about their creations).\nForms of participatory culture include:\n\nThe skills identified were:\n\nA 2005 study (Lenhardt & Madden) found that more than one-half of all teens have created media content, and roughly one third of teens who use the Internet have shared content they produced, indicating a high degree of involvement in participatory cultures. Such digital literacies emphasize the intellectual activities of a person working with sophisticated information communications technology, not on proficiency with the tool.\n\nIn 2003 the North Central Regional Educational Laboratory and the Metiri Group issued a report entitled \"enGauge® 21st Century Skills: Literacy in the Digital Age\" based on two years of research. The report called for policymakers and educators to define 21st century skills, highlight the relationship of those skills to conventional academic standards, and recognize the need for multiple assessments to measure and evaluate these skills within the context of academic standards and the current technological and global society. To provide a common understanding of, and language for discussing, the needs of students, citizens, and workers in a modern digital society, the report identified four \"skill clusters\":\n\nIn 1997, member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development launched the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) to monitor \"the extent to which students near the end of compulsory schooling have acquired the knowledge and skills essential for full participation in society\". In 2005 they identified three \"Competency Categories:\" \n\nThe AAC&U conducted several studies and surveys of their members. In 2007 they recommended that graduates of higher education attain four skills - The Essential Learning Outcomes:\n\nThey found that skills most widely addressed in college and university goals are:\n\nA 2015 survey of AAC&U member institutions added the following goals:\n\nThe ISTE Educational Technology Standards (formerly National Educational Technology Standards (NETS)) are a set of standards published by the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) to leverage the use of technology in K-12 education. These are sometimes intermixed with information and communication technologies (ICT) skills. In 2007 NETS issued a series of six performance indicators (only the first four are on their website as of 2016):\n\n\nIn 2007 the Educational Testing Service (ETS) ICT Literacy Panel released its digital literacy standards:\nInformation and Communication Technologies (ICT) proficiencies:\n\nA person possessing these skills would be expected to perform these tasks for a particular set of information: access, manage, integrate, evaluate, create/publish/present. The emphasis is on proficiency with digital tools.\n\nIn 2005, Chris Dede of the Harvard Graduate School of Education developed a framework based on new digital literacies entitled\nNeomillennial Learning Styles:\n\nDede category system\nWith the exponential expansion of personal access to Internet resources, including social media, information and content on the Internet has evolved from being created by website providers to individuals and communities of contributors. The 21st century Internet centered on material created by a small number of people, Web 2.0 tools (e.g. Wikipedia) foster online communication, collaboration, and creation of content by large numbers of people (individually or in groups) in online communities.\n\nIn 2009, Dede created a category system for Web 2.0 tools: \n\nIn 2015, the World Economic Forum published a report titled ‘New Vision for Education: Unlocking the Potential of Technology’ that focused on the pressing issue of the 21st-century skills gap and ways to address it through technology. In the report, they defined a set of 16 crucial proficiencies for education in the 21st century. Those skills include six “foundational literacies”, four “competencies” and six “character qualities” listed below.\n\nFoundation Literacies\n\nCompetencies\n\n\nCharacter Qualities\n\nIn a paper titled ‘Education for Life and Work: Developing Transferable Knowledge and Skills in the 21st Century’ produced by the National Research Council of National Academies, the National Research defines 21st century skills, describes how the skills relate to each other and summaries the evidence regarding 21st century skills. \n\nAs a first step toward describing “21st century skills,” the National Research Council identified three domains of competence: cognitive, interpersonal, and intrapersonal while recognizing that the three domains while different, are intertwined in human development and learning. These three domains represent distinct facets of human thinking and build on previous efforts to identify and organize dimensions of human behaviour. The committee produced the following cluster of 21st century skills in the above mentioned 3 domains. \n\nCognitive Competencies\n\n\nIntrapersonal Competencies\n\n\nInterpersonal Competencies\n\n\nMultiple agencies and organizations have issued guides and recommendation for implementation of 21st century skills in a variety of learning environments and learning spaces. These include five separate educational areas: standards, assessment, professional development, curriculum & instruction, and learning environments.\n\nThe designs of learning environments and curricula have been impacted by the initiatives and efforts to implement and support 21st century skills with a move away from the factory model school model and into a variety of different organizational models. Hands-on learning project-based learning have resulted in the development of programs and spaces such as STEM and makerspaces. Collaborative learning environments have fostered flexibility in furniture and classroom layout as well as differentiated spaces, such as small seminar rooms near classrooms. Literacy with, and access to, digital technology has impacted the design of furniture and fixed components as students and teachers use tablets, interactive whiteboards and interactive projectors. Classroom sizes have grown to accommodate a variety of furniture arrangements and grouping, many of which are less space-efficient than traditional configurations of desks in rows.\n\n\nBellanca, J.

Open to Enlightenment ideas, and noted for his interest in hydrological engineering, Mourouzis was forced to deal with the intrusions of Osman Pazvantoğlu's rebellious troops. In a rare gesture for his period, he renounced the throne in Wallachia, and his second rule in Moldavia was cut short by the intrigues of French diplomat Horace Sébastiani. Through his mother, he was a member of the Ghica family an Orthodox Phanariote family of Albanian origin.\n\nA member of the Mourouzis family of Phanariotes and the son of Constantine Mourouzis (one of the few Ottoman-appointed Princes to die in office), he was educated to speak six languages in addition to his native Greek. Alexander was Grand Dragoman of the Porte under Sultan Selim III, in which capacity he helped mediate the 1791 Treaty of Jassy, ending the Russo-Turkish War of 1787–1792. Selim rewarded his service by appointing him to the throne in Iași (Moldavia) in January 1792, and transferred a year later to the throne of Bucharest (1793–1796), where his first year in office coincided with a bubonic plague outbreak (which he dealt with by quarantining and confining the ill to the village of Dudești).\n\nDismissed owing to intrigues at the Ottoman court, he was reinstated in Bucharest (1798–1801). In 1799, he passed a resolution ending the labor conflict at the cloth factory in Pociovaliște (presently part of Bucharest). After reforming its system of worker employment and payment, as well as hiring Saxon experts from Transylvania to manage the industry, he denied the workers' request to institute two weeks off for each week of labor, and ordered activities to be resumed, while stressing that it was imperative to respect the Ottoman demand for textiles (\"see Labor movement in Romania\"). At the time, the employees did not receive payment, but worked in exchange for tax exemptions.\n\nOver the following year, Mourouzis had to deal with the incursion of Pazvantoğlu's rebellious troops in Oltenia, which resulted in the plundering and burning down much of the city of Craiova. News of the Craiova's destruction reached Bucharest and Mourouzis forbade fleeing the city; however, this did not prevent the boyars from sending their wealth into Habsburg lands for safekeeping. Mourouzis built fortifications on the road to Craiova and on the banks of Olt River; he attacked Pazvantoğlu's troops, who used the city's ruins as barricades — after several days of fighting, Pazvantoğlu and his troops fled Craiova and returned to Vidin. Powerless against the latter's destructive attacks, he asked to be relieved of his position, and, in a highly unusual gesture, paid off Ottoman authorities in exchange for his own replacement.\n\nAt the insistence of the French Empire, he was again appointed Prince of Moldavia (1802–1806 and 1806–1807), but was ultimately dismissed through another French intervention at the Porte - on August 12, 1806, Horace Sébastiani, the French Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, called on Selim III to punish Constantine Ypsilantis' pro-Russian activities in Wallachia, and to prevent a Moldavian-Wallachian-Russian alliance. This last event constituted one of the causes for the Russo-Turkish War of 1806–1812.\n\nMustafa IV ordered Mourouzis to be sent to the galleys, but he was pardoned soon after. He died at his home in Constantinople, and rumor had it that he was poisoned.\n\nMourouzis was an Enlightenment prince, whose time on the two thrones was connected with modernization. The prince belonged to the Freemasonry, having affiliated with two separate Lodges: in 1773, he was a member of the one active in the Transylvanian city of Hermannstadt, and, after 1803, belonged to the Moldavian Freemason branch in Galați. His Western contacts and his political ideals were probably connected with the goal of uniting the two Danubian Principalities under a single prince, as a symbolic legacy of Dacia: an 1800 atlas published in Vienna referred to his two rules as a single leadership of \"the two Dacias\". As local legislation was primarily based on Byzantine law, he acknowledged the importance given to the \"Hexabiblos\" of 14th century Byzantine jurist Konstantinos Armenopoulos, and ordered it to be translated into Romanian — although it failed to become official law in Wallachia, the \"Hexabiblos\" was widely used for reference by the Bucharest Divan.\n\nDuring his rules in Bucharest, Mourouzis notably rebuilt the princely residence of Curtea Nouă, instituted a boyar office as centralized tax collection in the capital city, and increased the water supply by tapping sources in the Cotroceni area. His interest in waterworks was also manifested during his stay in Moldavia, where he tapped water and built a reservoir for the capital Iași (through a system leading up to Golia Monastery) and provided Focșani with water from over the Milcov River (achieved following an understanding with Wallachia's Alexander Ypsilantis). It was in 1793 that the first modern retailing firm was inaugurated in Wallachia, maintained by the Frenchman Hortolan.\n\nUnder his rules, Wallachian and Moldavian ships for navigation on the Danube were built at newly created shipyards. He also organized the first mail delivery system in Moldavia. Like his father before him, Alexander Mourouzis founded schools and donated six-year scholarships for disadvantaged children. Among the educational institutions he created was the Orthodox seminary in Iași's Socola Monastery. He took a personal interest in scientific education, and attended experiments in physics at the Moldavian capital's Princely School.\n\nDuring his first reign over Moldavia, Mourouzis notably passed a resolution clarifying the surface of land which boyars were required to allocate to peasants working on their estates. It is the first document to divide agricultural workers into the three traditional categories, based on the number of oxen owned, of \"fruntași\" (\"foremost people\"), \"mijlocași\" (\"middle people\") and \"codași\" (\"backward people\"). At the time, it was recorded that associations of \"fruntași\" could function as estate leaseholders in the service of boyars or Orthodox monasteries. This right was suppressed in 1815.\n\nMourouzis was the recipient of a panegyric authored by the Moldavian boyar poet Costache Conachi, who praised the prince's achievements in hydrotechnics. Comments made on the poem, published by the Romantic nationalist Gheorghe Sion, were the subject of an 1873 disagreement between him and literary critic Titu Maiorescu. The latter placed Sion's essay among his examples of \"inebriation with words\" (a term which he and the \"Junimea\" society had coined as a definition for incoherent and needlessly subjective criticism).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6583979", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6583979", "title": "Angelica (character)", "text": "Angelica (character)\n\nAngelica is a princess in the epic poem \"Orlando innamorato\" by Matteo Maria Boiardo. She reappears in the saga's continuation, \"Orlando furioso\" by Ludovico Ariosto, and in various later works based on the two original \"Orlando\" pieces. The narratives are part of the Matter of France, a cycle of legendary history stories based on the adventures of Charlemagne and his paladins.\n\nIn \"Orlando Innamorato\", Angelica is introduced as the daughter of Galafrone, the king of \"Cathay\", or \"China\". But this seeming inconsistency can be resolved.\nBoiardo considered Cathay to be a city, and \"Cathay was a city in India inferior or Serica\" according to the Mappamondo Borgiano. She comes to Charlemagne's court with her brother Argalia (who assumes the identity of a knight named Uberto dal Leòne). All the knights are smitten with her, especially the cousins Orlando (Roland) and Rinaldo (Renaud), but the protective Argalia will only allow her to marry a man who can best him in a joust. When Argalia eventually falls to the Saracen knight Ferraù, Orlando and Rinaldo threaten to destroy each other over her. As the Saracens lay siege to Duke Naimon's estate, Charlemagne promises Angelica's hand to whichever cousin fights best for him. The battle is lost, however, and the characters go on to further adventure: Rinaldo and Angelica drink from magic fountains twice, each time leaving one madly in love and the other indifferent, while Orlando loses his wits to his passion.\n\nBoiardo left his epic unfinished, but the action was taken up in \"Orlando furioso\". Angelica is continually sought throughout the world by Orlando, Rinaldo, and the best knights from various countries. She eventually finds herself naked and chained to a rock in the sea, offered as a sacrifice to a sea monster called the orc (a situation identical to the perils of Andromeda). She is rescued by the African knight Ruggiero, who gives her a ring of invisibility. Later, pursued by the maddened Orlando, she uses the ring and vanishes. She ultimately falls in love with an ordinary Moor soldier Medoro and returns with him to Cathay; the lovesick Orlando requires the aid of his cousin Astolpho to recover his senses.\n\n"}

At that time a circular temenos, an open air religious space, was used by holders of high imperial positions in the territory.\n\nLittle is known about the intervening years, although a Moorish settlement occupied the lands sometime in the 12th century. The group eventually disappeared, and the area was abandoned. Much of the stonework was used by locals to build their own residences or used in public construction.\n\nThe re-discovery of these ruins date back to Valentim Fernandes in 1505; and Francisco d'Ollanda, around 1541, with the latter including designs and observations of the structures, which he observed were a Roman sanctuary. The identification of these ruins, corresponded to the first archeological discovery in Portugal. Its importance was largely recognized by the number of local, national and international visitors during the Renaissance. Among the illustrious visitors were members of the Portuguese Royal Family, namely King D. Manuel, and later, the Infante D. Luís, brother of King D. John III. \n\nThese descriptions suggest that the site was visitable during the 16th century, at a time when the structures were largely submerged in the sand. Yet, local memory helped the stories to continue, and the existence of a Roman sanctuary along the Sintrense beach remained in the minds of locals, even as its specific location could not be identified. Various studies and scientific work finally identified its presence on a small hilltop escarpment overlooking the Praia das Maçãs, known locally as the \"Alto da Vigia\" and \"Alconchel\". A team from the Archaeological Museum of São Miguel de Odrinhas began excavations in 2008, alongside a tower structure, unearthing a monumental Roman sanctuary.\n\nThe site is situated above cliffs overlooking the beach of Praia das Maçãs, on barren lands. The complex includes a Roman sanctuary and a tower dating from the 16th century. In addition, there were also identified vestiges from the Islamic epoch, totally unknown until their discovery, although the toponymy \"Alconchel\" (\"al-concilium\") may have alluded to its presence. \nArchitectural artefacts from the Moorish period correspond to a ribat (or \"convent\") that included various halls, with a mirhab oriented towards the southwest (in the direction of Mecca). The remaining materials associated with the Moors are residual, and include ceramics from the 12th century (likely associated the final phase of occupation), as well as shells and fires (suggesting a link between the coastal activities and food for these locals. In addition to the buildings, an area of graves were identified without any artefacts linked to the Islamic presence. The structures of the ribat also reused many of the architectural elements of the Roman epoch, that identifiable by the inscriptions, already identified by Fernandes and d'Ollanda during their excavations in the 16th century. \n\nThe importance of the sanctuary during the Roman period is reflected in the votive inscriptions, expressing health to the Emperor and long life to the Empire. These wishes are not normally associated with particular devotees, nor by local or provincial elites, but suggest that they were contracted by members of the Imperial class, namely governors of Lusitania or Imperial legates, by way of the Senate of Olissipo. The inscriptions were dedicated by Sextus Tigidius Perennis, governor of Lusitania, to the \"Soli et Lunae\" in 185 AD; between 200 and 209 by Junius Celanius, a governor, to the \"Soli aeterno Lunae\" and by Caius Julius Celsus, \"procurator province Lusitaniae\" in the late 2nd century.\n\nDuring excavations an inscription was recovered that attests to the importance of the local, since it was dedicated to the Sun and the Ocean, by a procurator of Agustus Cesear, and his family. In addition to the altar and funerary inscription, there were other Roman architectural elements discovered on the site, including a framed pots, fragments of columns and altars and large blocks for construction.\n"}

It follows the lives of the titular characters--respectively, a pampered-yet-spunky dog and a hyperactive rabbit--who get stuck in the Amazon Rainforest together. The show originally aired from August 21, 2004 to August 25, 2006 and reruns continued until June 21, 2010.\n\nA pampered dog (Brandy) and an easily excited rabbit (Mr. Whiskers) face a new life of challenges together when they fall out of an airplane and become stranded in the Amazon Rain Forest. They make new friends: Loa, the boa constrictor; toucan sisters Cheryl and Meryl; and Ed the otter. Stories follow the titular duo as they attempt to adapt to their new surroundings.\n\nBrandy and Mr. Whiskers start getting acquainted as they begin their new lives in the Rainforest. They build a tree house to live in, using debris that fell out of the plane's cargo compartment. A big part of the series is Brandy's desperation to getting back to her home in Palm Beach, Florida. In the meantime, both she and Mr. Whiskers work together and build an unlikely but genuine friendship despite having a lot of differences, adapt by exploring the environment, and making friends with the native animals. Brandy makes attempts to get the jungle to become a civilized society by introducing elements such as fashion, hygiene, and shiny rocks, their type of currency. Mr. Whiskers prefers to mix things up by using the powers of invention and imagination to occupy his time, but it usually causes havoc in the jungle and affects his popularity.\n\nAs Brandy and Mr. Whiskers get more settled in the jungle, a lot of changes are put in order. They redecorate the tree house by giving the interior a more \"homey environment\", which includes flowery wallpaper, tasteful decor and an indoor bathroom (this was after Mr. Whiskers' new \"dream house\" was destroyed). The native animals also become more anthropomorphic as they have now established a new market economy in the Amazon. Brandy and Mr. Whiskers discover the mall in the first episode of season 2, \"Get a Job\". They develop clothing, consumer products, restaurants, theme parks, TV commercials, a boy band called \"Sugartoad\" and a shopping mall. The adaptation has also lowered Brandy's desire to getting back home as she grows to truly accept her new life in the Amazon.\n\n\nBrandy and Whiskers have a friends relationship. They often get into fights. However, she is always on the lookout for escape opportunities. She is prone to act like a drama queen, and can be more annoying than Whiskers at times because of her spoiled upbringing. Brandy thinks she is a spaniel with a pedigree, but in the episode \"Pedigree, Schmedigree\", it is revealed that she is an unspecified mutt from a dog pound. She has blonde colored and straight dog ears (similar to pigtails), darker blonde skin and blue eyes. She usually wears a pink short-sleeved shirt, red jeans and purple platform sandals. She also wears what appears to be a collar on her neck. She usually acts mean to Whiskers, but deep down she cares about him.\n\n\n\nThe episode \"To the Moon Whiskers\" is found available in Disney Channel Collection Volume 2 for Game Boy Advance Video, along with \"Kim Possible\" and \"Lilo and Stitch\".\n\n"}

{"id": "55931", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55931", "title": "Chronology", "text": "Chronology\n\nChronology (from Latin \"chronologia\", from Ancient Greek , \"chrónos\", \"time\"; and , \"-logia\") is the science of arranging events in their order of occurrence in time. Consider, for example, the use of a timeline or sequence of events. It is also \"the determination of the actual temporal sequence of past events\".\n\nChronology is part of periodization. It is also part of the discipline of history, including earth history, the earth sciences, and study of the geologic time scale.\n\nChronology is the science of locating historical events in time. It relies upon chronometry, which is also known as timekeeping, and historiography, which examines the writing of history and the use of historical methods. Radiocarbon dating estimates the age of formerly living things by measuring the proportion of carbon-14 isotope in their carbon content. Dendrochronology estimates the age of trees by correlation of the various growth rings in their wood to known year-by-year reference sequences in the region to reflect year-to-year climatic variation. Dendrochronology is used in turn as a calibration reference for radiocarbon dating curves.\n\nThe familiar terms \"calendar\" and \"era\" (within the meaning of a coherent system of numbered calendar years) concern two complementary fundamental concepts of chronology. For example, during eight centuries the calendar belonging to the Christian era, which era was taken in use in the 8th century by Bede, was the Julian calendar, but after the year 1582 it was the Gregorian calendar. Dionysius Exiguus (about the year 500) was the founder of that era, which is nowadays the most widespread dating system on earth. An epoch is the date (year usually) when an era begins.\n\n\"Ab Urbe condita\" is Latin for \"from the founding of the City (Rome)\", traditionally set in 753 BC. It was used to identify the Roman year by a few Roman historians. Modern historians use it much more frequently than the Romans themselves did; the dominant method of identifying Roman years was to name the two consuls who held office that year. Before the advent of the modern critical edition of historical Roman works, AUC was indiscriminately added to them by earlier editors, making it appear more widely used than it actually was.\n\nIt was used systematically for the first time only about the year 400, by the Iberian historian Orosius. Pope Boniface IV, in about the year 600, seems to have been the first who made a connection between these this era and Anno Domini. (AD 1 = AUC 754.)\n\nDionysius Exiguus’ Anno Domini era (which contains only calendar years \"AD\") was extended by Bede to the complete Christian era (which contains, in addition all calendar years \"BC\", but no \"year zero\"). Ten centuries after Bede, the French astronomers Philippe de la Hire (in the year 1702) and Jacques Cassini (in the year 1740), purely to simplify certain calculations, put the Julian Dating System (proposed in the year 1583 by Joseph Scaliger) and with it an astronomical era into use, which contains a leap year zero, which precedes the year 1 (AD).\n\nWhile of critical importance to the historian, methods of determining chronology are used in most disciplines of science, especially astronomy, geology, paleontology and archaeology.\n\nIn the absence of written history, with its chronicles and , late 19th century archaeologists found that they could develop relative chronologies based on pottery techniques and styles. In the field of Egyptology, William Flinders Petrie pioneered sequence dating to penetrate pre-dynastic Neolithic times, using groups of contemporary artefacts deposited together at a single time in graves and working backwards methodically from the earliest historical phases of Egypt. This method of dating is known as seriation.\n\nKnown wares discovered at strata in sometimes quite distant sites, the product of trade, helped extend the network of chronologies. Some cultures have retained the name applied to them in reference to characteristic forms, for lack of an idea of what they called themselves: \"The Beaker People\" in northern Europe during the 3rd millennium BCE, for example. The study of the means of placing pottery and other cultural artifacts into some kind of order proceeds in two phases, classification and typology: Classification creates categories for the purposes of description, and typology seeks to identify and analyse changes that allow artifacts to be placed into sequences.\n\nLaboratory techniques developed particularly after mid-20th century helped constantly revise and refine the chronologies developed for specific cultural areas. Unrelated dating methods help reinforce a chronology, an axiom of corroborative evidence. Ideally, archaeological materials used for dating a site should complement each other and provide a means of cross-checking. Conclusions drawn from just one unsupported technique are usually regarded as unreliable.\n\nThe fundamental problem of chronology is to synchronize events. By synchronizing an event it becomes possible to relate it to the current time and to compare the event to other events. Among historians, a typical need to is to synchronize the reigns of kings and leaders in order to relate the history of one country or region to that of another. For example, the Chronicon of Eusebius (325 A.D.) is one of the major works of historical synchronism. This work has two sections. The first contains narrative chronicles of nine different kingdoms: Chaldean, Assyrian, Median, Lydian, Persian, Hebrew, Greek, Peloponnesian, Asian, and Roman. The second part is a long table synchronizing the events from each of the nine kingdoms in parallel columns. The adjacent image shows two pages from the second section.\n\nBy comparing the parallel columns, the reader can determine which events were contemporaneous, or how many years separated two different events. To place all the events on the same time scale, Eusebius used an Anno Mundi (A.M.) era, meaning that events were dated from the supposed beginning of the world as computed from the Book of Genesis in the Hebrew Pentateuch. According to the computation Eusebius used, this occurred in 5199 B.C. The Chronicon of Eusebius was widely used in the medieval world to establish the dates and times of historical events. Subsequent chronographers, such as George Syncellus (died circa 811), analyzed and elaborated on the Chronicon by comparing with other chronologies. The last great chronographer was Joseph Justus Scaliger (1540-1609) who reconstructed the lost Chronicon and synchronized all of ancient history in his two major works, \"De emendatione temporum\" (1583) and \"Thesaurus temporum\" (1606). Much of modern historical datings and chronology of the ancient world ultimately derives from these two works. Scaliger invented the concept of the Julian Day which is still used as the standard unified scale of time for both historians and astronomers.\n\nIn addition to the literary methods of synchronism used by traditional chronographers such as Eusebius, Syncellus and Scaliger, it is possible to synchronize events by archaeological or astronomical means. For example, the Eclipse of Thales, described in the first book of Herodotus can potentially be used to date the Lydian War because the eclipse took place during the middle of an important battle in that war. Likewise, various eclipses and other astronomical events described in ancient records can be used to astronomically synchronize historical events. Another method to synchronize events is the use of archaeological findings, such as pottery, to do sequence dating.\n\n\n\nAspects and examples of non-chronological story-telling:\n\n\n\n\n"}

This leads to a limited number of \"the usual suspects\" who will say expected ideas that will not require extensive explanation such as mainstream political ones.\nThe beauty of concision, you know, saying a couple sentences between two commercials, the beauty of that is you can only repeat conventional thoughts. Suppose I go on Nightline, whatever it is, two minutes, and I say Gaddafi is a terrorist, Khomeini is a murderer etcetera etcetera…I don’t need any evidence, everyone just nods. On the other hand, suppose you’re saying something that isn’t just regurgitating conventional pieties, suppose you say something that’s the least bit unexpected or controversial, people will quite reasonably expect to know what you mean. If you said that you’d better have a reason, better have some evidence. You can’t give evidence if you’re stuck with concision. That’s the genius of this structural constraint.\n\nFurthermore, introducing controversial or unexpected statements that do not conform to those conventional ideas are discouraged as time inefficient because the person will be required to explain and support them in detail. Since this can often take considerable time in itself and digress from the primary discussion topic of the broadcast, this is discouraged. Alternatively, the explanation could be subject to extensive editing for time which could lead to an inadequate presentation of the subject's thoughts.\n\nThis media control idea is illustrated in the film documentary, \"\", where journalist Jeff Greenfield explains why a person like Chomsky may be excluded from being interviewed on air because he takes too long to warm up. The film then follows up with Chomsky himself explaining the concept while the film gives examples of controversial statements he has made in the past that would require extensive explanation in an interview.\n\nThe 1999 feature film \"The Insider\" has a dramatization of the media concept where journalist Mike Wallace goes public on a news show about the censoring of a controversial story on \"60 Minutes\". When Wallace sees his interview broadcast, he is furious that his testimony is limited to a curt statement that does not adequately explain his position and the only excuse from the producers he receives is that it had to be cut for time.\n\n"}
{"id": "20324344", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20324344", "title": "Constructed language", "text": "Constructed language\n\nA constructed language (sometimes called a conlang) is a language whose phonology, grammar, and vocabulary are, instead of having developed naturally, consciously devised for communication between intelligent beings, most commonly for use by humanoids. Constructed languages may also be referred to as artificial, planned or invented languages and in some cases fictional languages. There are many possible reasons to create a constructed language, such as to ease human communication (see international auxiliary language and code), to give fiction or an associated constructed setting an added layer of realism, for experimentation in the fields of linguistics, cognitive science, and machine learning, for artistic creation, and for language games. \n\nThe expression \"planned language\" is sometimes used to indicate international auxiliary languages and other languages designed for actual use in human communication. Some prefer it to the adjective \"artificial\", as this term may be perceived as pejorative. Outside Esperanto culture, the term language planning means the prescriptions given to a natural language to standardize it; in this regard, even a \"natural language\" may be artificial in some respects, meaning some of its words have been crafted by conscious decision. Prescriptive grammars, which date to ancient times for classical languages such as Latin and Sanskrit, are rule-based codifications of natural languages, such codifications being a middle ground between naïve natural selection and development of language and its explicit construction. The term \"glossopoeia\" is also used to mean language construction, particularly construction of artistic languages.\n\nConlang speakers are rare. For example, the Hungarian census of 2001 found 4570 speakers of Esperanto, 10 of Romanid, two each of Interlingua and Ido and one each of Idiom Neutral and Mundolinco. The Russian census of 2010 found 992 speakers of Esperanto, nine of Ido, one of Edo and no speakers of Slovio or Interlingua.\n\nThe terms \"planned\", \"constructed\", and \"artificial\" are used differently in some traditions. For example, few speakers of Interlingua consider their language artificial, since they assert that it has no invented content: Interlingua's vocabulary is taken from a small set of natural languages, and its grammar is based closely on these source languages, even including some degree of irregularity; its proponents prefer to describe its vocabulary and grammar as standardized rather than artificial or constructed. Similarly, Latino sine flexione (LsF) is a simplification of Latin from which the inflections have been removed. As with Interlingua, some prefer to describe its development as \"planning\" rather than \"constructing\". Some speakers of Esperanto and Esperantidos also avoid the term \"artificial language\" because they deny that there is anything \"unnatural\" about the use of their language in human communication.\n\nBy contrast, some philosophers have argued that all human languages are conventional or artificial. François Rabelais, for instance, stated: \"C'est abus de dire que nous avons une langue naturelle; les langues sont par institution arbitraires et conventions des peuples.\" (\"It's an abuse to say that we have a natural language; languages are arbitrary and conventions of peoples by institution.\")\n\nAn artificial language can also refer to a language that emerges naturally out of experimental studies within the framework of artificial language evolution.\n\nFurthermore, fictional and experimental languages can be naturalistic in that they are meant to sound natural and have realistic amounts of irregularity. If a naturalistic conlang is derived \"a posteriori\" from a real-world natural language, a real-world reconstructed proto-language (such as Vulgar Latin or Proto-Indo-European) or a fictional proto-language, it should imitate natural processes of phonological, lexical, and grammatical change. In contrast with Interlingua, they are not usually intended for easy learning or communication, and most artlangers do not consider Interlingua to be naturalistic in the sense in which this term is used in artlang criticism. Thus, a naturalistic fictional language tends to be more difficult and complex. While Interlingua has simpler grammar, syntax, and orthography than its source languages (though more complex and irregular than Esperanto or its descendants), naturalistic fictional languages typically mimic behaviors of natural languages like irregular verbs and nouns and complicated phonological processes.\n\nIn terms of purpose, most constructed languages can broadly be divided into:\n\n\nThe boundaries between these categories are by no means clear. A constructed language could easily fall into more than one of the above categories. A logical language created for aesthetic reasons would also be classifiable as an artistic language, which might be created by someone with philosophical motives intending for said conlang to be used as an auxiliary language. There are no rules, either inherent in the process of language construction or externally imposed, that would limit a constructed language to fitting only one of the above categories.\n\nA constructed language can have native speakers if young children learn it from parents who speak it fluently. According to \"Ethnologue\", there are \"200–2000 who speak Esperanto as a first language\". A member of the Klingon Language Institute, d'Armond Speers, attempted to raise his son as a native (bilingual with English) Klingon speaker.\n\nAs soon as a constructed language has a community of fluent speakers, especially if it has numerous native speakers, it begins to evolve and hence loses its constructed status. For example, Modern Hebrew and its pronunciation norms were developed from existing traditions of Hebrew, such as Mishnaic Hebrew and Biblical Hebrew following a general Sephardic pronunciation, rather than engineered from scratch, and has undergone considerable changes since the state of Israel was founded in 1948 (Hetzron 1990:693). However, linguist Ghil'ad Zuckermann argues that Modern Hebrew, which he terms \"Israeli\", is a Semito-European hybrid based not only on Hebrew but also on Yiddish and other languages spoken by revivalists. Zuckermann therefore endorses the translation of the Hebrew Bible into what he calls \"Israeli\". Esperanto as a living spoken language has evolved significantly from the prescriptive blueprint published in 1887, so that modern editions of the \"Fundamenta Krestomatio\", a 1903 collection of early texts in the language, require many footnotes on the syntactic and lexical differences between early and modern Esperanto.\n\nProponents of constructed languages often have many reasons for using them. The famous but disputed Sapir–Whorf hypothesis is sometimes cited; this claims that the language one speaks influences the way one thinks. Thus, a \"better\" language should allow the speaker to think more clearly or intelligently or to encompass more points of view; this was the intention of Suzette Haden Elgin in creating Láadan, a feminist language embodied in her feminist science fiction series \"Native Tongue\". A constructed language could also be used to \"restrict\" thought, as in George Orwell's Newspeak, or to \"simplify\" thought, as in Toki Pona. In contrast, linguists such as Steven Pinker argue that ideas exist independently of language. For example, in the book \"The Language Instinct\", Pinker states that children spontaneously re-invent slang and even grammar with each generation. These linguists argue that attempts to control the range of human thought through the reform of language would fail, as concepts like \"freedom\" will reappear in new words if the old words vanish.\n\nProponents claim a particular language makes it easier to express and understand concepts in one area, and more difficult in others. An example can be taken from the way various programming languages make it easier to write certain kinds of programs and harder to write others.\n\nAnother reason cited for using a constructed language is the telescope rule, which claims that it takes less time to first learn a simple constructed language and then a natural language, than to learn only a natural language. Thus, if someone wants to learn English, some suggest learning Basic English first. Constructed languages like Esperanto and Interlingua are in fact often simpler due to the typical lack of irregular verbs and other grammatical quirks. Some studies have found that learning Esperanto helps in learning a non-constructed language later (see propaedeutic value of Esperanto).\n\nCodes for constructed languages include the ISO 639-2 \"art\" for conlangs; however, some constructed languages have their own ISO 639 language codes (e.g. \"eo\" and \"epo\" for Esperanto, \"jbo\" for Lojban, \"ia\" and \"ina\" for Interlingua, \"tlh\" for Klingon and \"io\" and \"ido\" for Ido).\n\nAn \"a priori\" constructed language is one whose features (including vocabulary, grammar, etc.) are not based on an existing language, and an \"a posteriori\" language is the opposite. This categorization, however, is not absolute, as many constructed languages may be both \"a priori\" and \"a posteriori\" depending on which linguistic factors of them are observed.\n\nAn \"a priori\" language (from Latin \"a priori\", \"from the former\") is any constructed language of which all or a number of features are not based on existing languages, but rather invented or elaborated as to work in a different way or to allude different purposes. Some \"a priori\" languages are designed to be international auxiliary languages that remove what could be considered an unfair learning advantage for native speakers of a source language that would otherwise exist for \"a posteriori\" languages. Others, known as philosophical or taxonomic languages, try to categorize their vocabulary, either to express an underlying philosophy or to make it easier to recognize new vocabulary.\n\nThere have been many languages constructed to test linguistic hypotheses (such as the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis) and/or to explore innovative or invented linguistic features. They are therefore necessarily designed with \"a priori\" features. Examples include Ithkuil, Kotava, Lojban (and its predecessor Loglan, both of which are also schematic), and even the fictional-setting Láadan.\n\nMost artistic languages, i.e. those created for amusement or to serve as natural languages of fictional worlds, are largely \"a priori\" in both vocabulary and grammar. Among classical \"fictional natural languages\" are Klingon from the science-fiction franchise \"Star Trek\" and the languages created by fantasy writer J. R. R. Tolkien. Other examples include Dothraki and Valyrian from \"Game of Thrones', 'Trigedasleng from The 100, Atlantean from \"\", Kēlen by Sylvia Sotomayor and aUI by W. John Weilgart. Láadan is both experimental and artistic.\n\nAn \"a posteriori\" language (from Latin \"a posteriori\", \"from the latter\"), according to Louis Couturat, is any constructed language whose elements are borrowed from or based on existing languages. The term can also be extended to controlled versions of existing languages, and is most commonly used to refer to vocabulary despite other features. In distinguishing whether the language is \"a priori\" or \"a posteriori\", the prevalence and distribution of respectable traits is often the key. They may be controlled, naturalistic or schematic.\n\nA controlled language is a version of a natural language with improvements intended to make it easier to learn and to use, such as reduced vocabulary, simplified grammar, etc. These include:\n\nNaturalistic languages are constructed languages which largely imitate the grammar and vocabulary of a particular group of related languages within a family, thus being potentially zonal, i.e. auxiliary between speakers of these languages.\n\nA constructed language is considered schematic when it features a more original grammar, which is usually precise and regular to avoid ambiguities and other obstacles to an easy study, and a vocabulary coming from languages of different families, to make it as recognizable as possible for potential international auxiliary purposes. For that they can be described as half \"a priori\", half \"a posteriori\". There have been many attempts of developing languages with these characteristics, including:\n\nGrammatical speculation dates from Classical Antiquity, appearing for instance in Plato's \"Cratylus\" in Hermogenes's contention that words are not inherently linked to what they refer to; that people apply \"a piece of their own voice ... to the thing\". Athenaeus of Naucratis, in Book III of Deipnosophistae, tells the story of two figures: Dionysius of Sicily and Alexarchus. Dionysius of Sicily created neologisms like \"menandros\" \"virgin\" (from \"menei\" \"waiting\" and \"andra\" \"husband\"), \"menekratēs\" \"pillar\" (from \"menei\" \"it remains in one place\" and \"kratei\" \"it is strong\"), and \"ballantion\" \"javelin\" (from \"balletai enantion\" \"thrown against someone\"). Incidentally, the more common Greek words for those three are \"parthenos\", \"stulos\", and \"akon\". Alexarchus of Macedon, the brother of King Cassander of Macedon, was the founder of the city of Ouranopolis. Athenaeus recounts a story told by Heracleides of Lembos that Alexarchus \"introduced a peculiar vocabulary, referring to a rooster as a \"dawn-crier,\" a barber as a \"mortal-shaver,\" a drachma as \"worked silver\"...and a herald as an \"aputēs\" [from \"ēputa\" \"loud-voiced\"]. \"He once wrote something...to the public authorities in Casandreia...As for what this letter says, in my opinion not even the Pythian god could make sense of it.\" While the mechanisms of grammar suggested by classical philosophers were designed to explain existing languages (Latin, Greek, Sanskrit), they were not used to construct new grammars. Roughly contemporary to Plato, in his descriptive grammar of Sanskrit, Pāṇini constructed a set of rules for explaining language, so that the text of his grammar may be considered a mixture of natural and constructed language.\n\nA legend recorded in the seventh-century Irish work Auraicept na n-Éces claims that Fénius Farsaid visited Shinar after the confusion of tongues, and he and his scholars studied the various languages for ten years, taking the best features of each to create \"in Bérla tóbaide\" (\"the selected language\"), which he named \"Goídelc\"—the Irish language. This appears to be the first mention of the concept of a constructed language in literature.\n\nThe earliest non-natural languages were considered less \"constructed\" than \"super-natural\", mystical, or divinely inspired. The Lingua Ignota, recorded in the 12th century by St. Hildegard of Bingen is an example, and apparently the first entirely artificial language. It is a form of private mystical cant (see also language of angels). An important example from Middle-Eastern culture is Balaibalan, invented in the 16th century. Kabbalistic grammatical speculation was directed at recovering the original language spoken by Adam and Eve in Paradise, lost in the confusion of tongues. The first Christian project for an ideal language is outlined in Dante Alighieri's \"De vulgari eloquentia\", where he searches for the ideal Italian vernacular suited for literature. Ramon Llull's \"Ars Magna\" was a project of a perfect language with which the infidels could be convinced of the truth of the Christian faith. It was basically an application of combinatorics on a given set of concepts. During the Renaissance, Lullian and Kabbalistic ideas were drawn upon in a magical context, resulting in cryptographic applications. The Voynich manuscript may be an example of this.\n\nRenaissance interest in Ancient Egypt, notably the discovery of the \"Hieroglyphica\" of Horapollo, and first encounters with the Chinese script directed efforts towards a perfect written language. Johannes Trithemius, in \"Steganographia\" and \"Polygraphia\", attempted to show how all languages can be reduced to one. In the 17th century, interest in magical languages was continued by the Rosicrucians and Alchemists (like John Dee and his Enochian). Jakob Boehme in 1623 spoke of a \"natural language\" (\"Natursprache\") of the senses.\n\nMusical languages from the Renaissance were tied up with mysticism, magic and alchemy, sometimes also referred to as the language of the birds. The Solresol project of 1817 re-invented the concept in a more pragmatic context.\n\nThe 17th century saw the rise of projects for \"philosophical\" or \"a priori\" languages, such as:\n\n\nThese early taxonomic conlangs produced systems of hierarchical classification that were intended to result in both spoken and written expression. Leibniz had a similar purpose for his \"lingua generalis\" of 1678, aiming at a lexicon of characters upon which the user might perform calculations that would yield true propositions automatically, as a side-effect developing binary calculus. These projects were not only occupied with reducing or modelling grammar, but also with the arrangement of all human knowledge into \"characters\" or hierarchies, an idea that with the Enlightenment would ultimately lead to the \"Encyclopédie\". Many of these 17th−18th centuries conlangs were pasigraphies, or purely written languages with no spoken form or a spoken form that would vary greatly according to the native language of the reader.\n\nLeibniz and the encyclopedists realized that it is impossible to organize human knowledge unequivocally in a tree diagram, and consequently to construct an \"a priori\" language based on such a classification of concepts. Under the entry \"Charactère\", D'Alembert critically reviewed the projects of philosophical languages of the preceding century. After the \"Encyclopédie\", projects for \"a priori\" languages moved more and more to the lunatic fringe. Individual authors, typically unaware of the history of the idea, continued to propose taxonomic philosophical languages until the early 20th century (e.g. Ro), but most recent engineered languages have had more modest goals; some are limited to a specific field, like mathematical formalism or calculus (e.g. Lincos and programming languages), others are designed for eliminating syntactical ambiguity (e.g., Loglan and Lojban) or maximizing conciseness (e.g., Ithkuil).\n\nAlready in the \"Encyclopédie\" attention began to focus on \"a posteriori\" auxiliary languages. Joachim Faiguet de Villeneuve in the article on \"Langue\" wrote a short proposition of a \"laconic\" or regularized grammar of French. During the 19th century, a bewildering variety of such International Auxiliary Languages (IALs) were proposed, so that Louis Couturat and Léopold Leau in \"Histoire de la langue universelle\" (1903) reviewed 38 projects.\n\nThe first of these that made any international impact was Volapük, proposed in 1879 by Johann Martin Schleyer; within a decade, 283 Volapükist clubs were counted all over the globe. However, disagreements between Schleyer and some prominent users of the language led to schism, and by the mid-1890s it fell into obscurity, making way for Esperanto, proposed in 1887 by Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof, and its descendants. Interlingua, the most recent auxlang to gain a significant number of speakers, emerged in 1951, when the International Auxiliary Language Association published its Interlingua–English Dictionary and an accompanying . The success of Esperanto did not stop others from trying to construct new auxiliary languages, such as Leslie Jones' Eurolengo, which mixes elements of English and Spanish.\n\nLoglan (1955) and its descendants constitute a pragmatic return to the aims of the \"a priori\" languages, tempered by the requirement of usability of an auxiliary language. Thus far, these modern \"a priori\" languages have garnered only small groups of speakers.\n\nRobot Interaction Language (2010) is a spoken language that is optimized for communication between machines and humans. The major goals of ROILA are that it should be easily learnable by the human user, and optimized for efficient recognition by computer speech recognition algorithms.\n\nLanguage can be artistic to the extent that artists use language as a source of creativity in art, poetry, calligraphy or as a metaphor to address themes as cultural diversity and the vulnerability of the individual in a globalizing world. \n\nSome people prefer however to take pleasure in constructing, crafting a language by a conscious decision for reasons of literary enjoyment or aesthetic reasons without any claim of usefulness. Such artistic languages begin to appear in Early Modern literature (in Pantagruel, and in Utopian contexts), but they only seem to gain notability as serious projects beginning in the 20th century. \"A Princess of Mars\" (1912) by Edgar Rice Burroughs was possibly the first fiction of that century to feature a constructed language. J. R. R. Tolkien developed a family of related fictional languages and discussed artistic languages publicly, giving a lecture entitled \"A Secret Vice\" in 1931 at a congress. (Orwell's Newspeak is considered a satire of an IAL rather than an artistic language proper.)\n\nBy the beginning of the first decade of the 21st century, it had become common for science-fiction and fantasy works set in other worlds to feature constructed languages, or more commonly, an extremely limited but defined vocabulary which \"suggests\" the existence of a complete language, and constructed languages are a regular part of the genre, appearing in \"Star Wars\", \"Star Trek\", \"Lord of the Rings (Elvish)\", \"Stargate SG-1\", \"\", \"Game of Thrones (Dothraki language and Valyrian languages)\", \"Avatar\", \"Dune\" and the \"Myst\" series of computer adventure games.\n\nVarious paper zines on constructed languages were published from the 1970s through the 1990s, such as \"Glossopoeic Quarterly\", \"Taboo Jadoo\", and \"The Journal of Planned Languages\".\nThe Conlang Mailing List was founded in 1991, and later split off an AUXLANG mailing list dedicated to international auxiliary languages. In the early to mid-1990s a few conlang-related zines were published as email or websites, such as \"Vortpunoj\" and \"Model Languages\". The Conlang mailing list has developed a community of conlangers with its own customs, such as translation challenges and translation relays, and its own terminology. Sarah Higley reports from results of her surveys that the demographics of the Conlang list are primarily men from North America and western Europe, with a smaller number from Oceania, Asia, the Middle East, and South America, with an age range from thirteen to over sixty; the number of women participating has increased over time.\n\nMore recently founded online communities include the Zompist Bulletin Board (ZBB; since 2001) and the Conlanger Bulletin Board. Discussion on these forums includes presentation of members' conlangs and feedback from other members, discussion of natural languages, whether particular conlang features have natural language precedents, and how interesting features of natural languages can be repurposed for conlangs, posting of interesting short texts as translation challenges, and meta-discussion about the philosophy of conlanging, conlangers' purposes, and whether conlanging is an art or a hobby. Another 2001 survey by Patrick Jarrett showed an average age of 30.65, with the average time since starting to invent languages 11.83 years. A more recent thread on the ZBB showed that many conlangers spend a relatively small amount of time on any one conlang, moving from one project to another; about a third spend years on developing the same language.\n\n"}

These costumes show their social status and background.\n\nPantalone typically wore tight red pants and a matching shirt, a long black cape, black or red pointed shoes, and a belt that had a purse attached. Pantalone also carried a knife and handkerchief, and wore glasses. His hat sat very close to his head, and did not have a brim – very much like a skullcap. He might also wear a codpiece.\n\nIl Dottore was dressed almost entirely in black – shoes, pants, shirt, robe, belt, and hat – broken only by a white handkerchief, white ruffled collar, white cuffs on his sleeves, or maybe white socks. The pants came to his knees, as did the full cloak that stood out, like a dress with a petticoat. His hat could either be small and look like a skullcap, or larger and floppy with a wide brim.\n\nIl Capitano did not have a consistent dress code, but he did have a consistent costume theme. He wore the current soldiers' outfit from a foreign country. Sometimes his clothes were slashed to show that he had been in battle. His hat was overdone and typically had large feathers sticking out of it. Ribbons and shiny buttons often cluttered his clothes. He always carried a sword, and in the seventeenth century the sword upgraded to a gun. Every Il Capitano costume also included a coat or cloak, that he could fling off in a moment of rage or passion.\n\nThe Lovers wore whatever was the latest fashion. They wore a lot of makeup, but tastefully done to match the elaborate outfits. They never wore masks.\n\nPulcinella always had white baggy pants and shirt, large buttons on the shirt, and a piece under his garments that made his belly appear very large. His clothes were held on by a rope belt, where a dagger and purse would hang. A humpback piece was sometimes used. He also wore a mask that depicted a large, sometimes broken nose. His hat was short and fluffy.\n\nHarlequin's costume has varied over time. At first, in the mid sixteen century, his clothes were light colored and baggy, with red, yellow, and green patches with no particular pattern. His facial hair suggested a younger man for a few years, but then a fuller beard was worn later. He had a black mask and a feathered white hat. About a hundred years later, his signature outfit changed to include white stripes and colored diamonds, or triangles instead of patches. For the next 200 years, the suit got tighter, and a black belt was added. He wore a hat with two points, and his clothes had lots of sparkles. By the twentieth century, all the sparkles, collar ruffles, and large fancy hats were gone. Arlecchino wore a very small hat, the mask was sometimes swapped out for a face-painted diamond, and the costume pattern became entirely made up of diamonds with a small bow or collar.\n\nBrighella wore a servant's suit of rough off-white fabric, trimmed with green on the sides of his pants and down the front of his long shirt. His mask had a hooked nose, beard, and mustache. His dagger was worn at his belt.\n\nCoviello had a lighter beige mask with a large nose, and his white costume had bells attached.\n\nMezzettino wore servant's clothes with red stripes, but without the common servant's mask.\n\nZanni was the main servant, who wore large loose pants and a shirt that had a hood.\n\nScapino wore outfits with white and green stripes, and his mask had a hooked nose and pointed beard.\n\nPierrot had loose white clothing, with a large matching collar. He painted his face white instead of wearing a mask.\n\nPedrolino's costume was essentially like Pierrot's – white, big buttons, short hat, and white face – but it was way too big for him, and the sleeves covered his hands, to emphasize that Pedrolino was a little person in hand-me-downs.\n\nColumbina's costume reflected her current master's, but included an apron. She wore no mask, but instead a bonnet, and her skirts were of different colors.\n\nScaramouche wore black clothes without a mask. Defiant eyebrows and a powdered face accompanied the large black mustache. He had a white collar, and a large loose hat that hung down over his neck.\n\nTartaglia wore a black hat and very thick glasses.\n\nRosetta was Pulcinella's maid or wife, who wore a dress with patches, like the early Arrlechino.\n\nTrivelino was a Zanni who dressed in the Arlecchino fashion.\n"}

Books of his song lyrics, diaries and letters also have been published. Some of his plays, such as \"Hay Fever\", \"Private Lives\", \"Design for Living\", \"Present Laughter\" and \"Blithe Spirit\", have entered the regular theatre repertoire. His stage and film acting and directing career spanned six decades, and his cabaret performances were very popular in the 1950s and 1960s. Coward won an Academy Honorary Award in 1943 for his naval film drama \"In Which We Serve\". Many of Coward's plays were adapted for film.\n\nCoward was knighted in 1969 and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. A statue of Coward was unveiled by the Queen Mother in the foyer of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in 1998. The Noël Coward Theatre in St Martin's Lane, originally called the New Theatre, was renamed in his honour in 2006.\n\nThe playwright John Osborne said, \"Mr Coward is his own invention and contribution to this century. Anyone who cannot see that should keep well away from the theatre.\" Kenneth Tynan wrote in 1964, \"Even the youngest of us will know, in fifty years' time, exactly what we mean by 'a very Noel Coward sort of person'.\" \"The Times\" said of him, \"None of the great figures of the English theatre has been more versatile than he,\" and the paper ranked his plays in \"the classical tradition of Congreve, Sheridan, Wilde and Shaw\". In praise of his versatility, another admirer said, \"There are probably greater painters than Noël, greater novelists than Noël, greater librettists, greater composers of music, greater singers, greater dancers, greater comedians, greater tragedians, greater stage producers, greater film directors, greater cabaret artists, greater TV stars. If there are, they are fourteen different people. Only one man combined all fourteen different labels – The Master.\"\n\nA symposium published in 1999 marked the centenary of Coward's birth and listed some major productions of Coward shows scheduled for the year in Britain and North America, including \"Ace of Clubs, After the Ball, Blithe Spirit, Cavalcade, Easy Virtue, Hay Fever, Present Laughter, Private Lives, Sail Away, Song at Twilight, The Young Idea\" and \"Waiting in the Wings\", with stars including Lauren Bacall, Wendy Craig, Fenella Fielding, Derek Griffiths, Rosemary Harris, Michael Jayston, Penelope Keith, Anton Lesser, Geraldine McEwan, Ian McKellen, Marie McLaughlin, Corin Redgrave, Greta Scacchi, Juliet Stevenson and Elaine Stritch. Tim Rice said of Coward's songs: \"The wit and wisdom of Noël Coward's lyrics will be as lively and contemporary in 100 years' time as they are today,\" and many have been recorded by Paul McCartney, Sting, Elton John, Robbie Williams, Pet Shop Boys, The Divine Comedy, Vic Reeves, Ian Bostridge, Damon Albarn, Michael Nyman, and others.\n\nCoward is depicted in several plays. He was played by Guy Henry in the Afternoon Play of 4 May 2007, \"The Master and Mrs Tucker\", by Roy Apps, which told of Coward's friendship with Edith Nesbit (played by Ann Bell). \"Marvellous Party\", a comic play about a middle-age reunion in Las Vegas of Coward and his collaborator Esmé Wynne-Tyson, by her son Jon Wynne-Tyson, was broadcast by the BBC World Service in May 1994, starring Stanley Baxter as Coward and Dorothy Tutin as Wynne-Tyson. Coward is the leading figure in Jeremy Kingston's comedy, \"Making Dickie Happy\", also featuring Agatha Christie and Louis Mountbatten (the 'Dickie' of the title), first staged at the Rosemary Branch Theatre in London in September 2004. \"Two Old Queens\", by John Senczuk, is a musical comic duologue between Coward (or his spirit) and the Queen Mother at the unveiling of the statue of Coward in Poets' Corner. The piece has been touring in Australia since 2007. A play about the friendship between Coward and Marlene Dietrich, called \"Lunch with Marlene\", by Chris Burgess, ran at the New End Theatre in 2008. The second act presents a musical revue, including Coward songs such as \"Don't Let's Be Beastly to the Germans\".\n\nHe is also portrayed in several films and in television and radio shows. He was played by his godson Daniel Massey in the 1969 film \"Star!\" and by David Benson) as a regular character in the fifth and sixth series of the award-winning BBC sitcom \"Goodnight Sweetheart\". In the episode \"Meltdown\" of the BBC comedy \"Red Dwarf\", Coward appears as a wax-droid on a theme park planet. In a 1989 TV film about James Bond creator Ian Fleming, Coward was played by Julian Fellowes. Coward is portrayed by Guy Siner in the 1991 episode \"Royal Flush\" of the BBC comedy \"You Rang, M'Lord?\". Marcy Kahan's Noël Coward quintet for BBC Radio 4 dramatises Coward as a detective in \"Design For Murder\" (2000), \"A Bullet at Balmain's\" (2003) and \"Death at the Desert Inn\" (2004), and as a spy in \"Blithe Spy\" (2002) and \"Our Man in Jamaica\" (2007). The cast of the quintet includes Malcolm Sinclair as Coward, Eleanor Bron as his secretary and Tam Williams as Cole Lesley.\n\nThe 2002 \"Doctor Who\" novel \"Mad Dogs and Englishmen\" features a version of Coward who has allied himself with alien poodles and gained time travel technology. Other characters based on Coward include Beverly Carlton in the 1939 Broadway play \"The Man Who Came to Dinner\". Reginald Gardiner played the same character in the 1942 film of the play). In the 1982 film \"Better Late than Never\", David Niven played Nick Cartland, an ageing cabaret artiste, whose showpiece is \"I've Been to a Marvellous Party\".\n\nUses, homages and parodies of Coward's music and writings include a Monty Python parody, \"Penis Song\", used in their 1983 movie, \"The Meaning of Life\" and in their album \"Monty Python Sings\", sung in the persona of a Noel Coward-style lounge singer. Coward's dialogue style was lampooned in the recurring sketch \"Fiona and Charles\" in the radio show \"Round the Horne\". Coward's play \"Private Lives\" is parodied in the off-Broadway musical revue \"Secrets Every Smart Traveler Should Know\" in a short scene entitled \"Private Wives\". The 2007 video game BioShock features three of Coward's recordings: \"Twentieth Century Blues\", \"World Weary\" and \"The Party's Over Now\".\n\nThe opening to the song \"The Lady Is a Tramp\" includes the line \"Alas, I missed the Beaux Arts Ball, and what is twice as sad I was never at a party where they honored Noël Ca-ad (Coward)\". In the Ian Dury song \"There Ain't Half Been Some Clever Bastards\", the lyrics include: \"Noël Coward was a charmer/ As a writer he was brahma /Velvet jackets and pyjamas/ \"The Gay Divorce\" and other dramas.\" In the episode \"Back in the Red\" of \"Red Dwarf\", Lister refers to Kryten as sounding \"like Noël Coward's elocution teacher\". In the episode \"Spin\" of \"House M.D.\", Stacy comments on an argument between House and Mark by saying: \"My goodness, it's like watching Oscar Wilde and Noël Coward in the third grade.\" In the (1969) English film \"Kes\", a man inquires about his interest in Coward's autobiography, \"Present Indicative\". The name of the men's clothing line 'Godspeed the Well-Dressed Man' came from the closing of one of Coward's letters.\n\n\n"}

Jamdanis are 100% hand woven and originate from the Mughal era. Jamdanis are produced by a traditional high quality cottage industry, which is slowly dying out due to the slow production process. A single medium-range Jamdani saree may take as long as 3 months to complete.\n\nThe Old City of Dhaka is home to over 2000 buildings built between the 16th and 19th centuries, which form an integral part of Dhaka's cultural heritage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

With only the sparest of plots, these tales often depend upon repetition and rhythm for their effect, and can require a skilled storyteller to negotiate their tongue-twisting repetitions in performance. The climax is sometimes abrupt and sobering as in \"The Gingerbread Man.\" The device often takes the form of a cumulative song or nursery rhyme. Many cumulative tales feature a series of animals or forces of nature each more powerful than the last.\n\nCumulative tales have a long pedigree. In an early Jewish Midrash, considered to date from the sixth century AD, Abraham is brought before King Nimrod, who commands him to worship fire. Abraham replies that it would be more reasonable to worship water, which can quench fire and is therefore more powerful. When this premise is granted, he points out that the clouds, as sustainers of water, are more worthy of worship, and then that the wind that disperses them is more powerful still. Finally he confronts Nimrod with the observation that \"man can stand up against the wind or shield himself behind the walls of his house\" (Genesis Rabba xxxviii).\n\nThere is a similar tale, The Mouse Turned into a Maid, in the Panchatantra, in which the mouse-maid is successively introduced to the sun, the cloud, the wind and the mountain. She prefers each in turn as stronger than the last, but finally a mouse is found to be stronger than even the mountain, and so she marries the mouse. Stories of this type, such as the Japanese The Husband of the Rat's Daughter, are widely diffused.\n\nIn the Aarne-Thompson classification system, types 2000-2100 are all cumulative tales, including:\n\n\n\n"}

The headquarters are located at Thanikachalam Road, T. Nagar, Chennai.\n\nThe organisation was established by Annie Besant with support from Mahatma Gandhi, who became the founder president of the Sabha, who held the post till his death. In 1964, the institution was recognised by the Indian Government as one of the Institutes of National Importance.\n\nThe Hindi movement in South India was started in the year 1918 by Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi saw the need to unite the northern and southern states of the country in the greatest interest of integration of the nation, as Hindi was spoken by the largest section of the people of India. Therefore, he founded the Dakshin Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha at Madras to propagate the study of Hindi in the then Madras Presidency and princely states of Banganapalle, Cochin, Hyderabad, Mysore, Pudukkottai, Sanduru and Travancore. The Sabha was inaugurated by Annie Besant on 17 June 1918.\n\nThe movement was inaugurated by the Annie Besant under the presidency at Gokhale Hall in Madras. The first Hindi class was taken by Gandhi's son Devdas Gandhi. Hindi training schools were started in Andhra and Tamil Nadu. The number of students increased from 80 in 1919 to hundreds of thousands in subsequent years. Today the movement can claim more than 7000 workers working in 6000 centres, covering the entire area of the five states, viz. Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, with an area of 650,000 square kilometers with a population of about 120 million.\n\nBy 1927, the Hindi Prachar Sabha emerged as an independent organization, and Mahatma Gandhi remained its president until his death in 1948. During the silver jubilee celebrations of the Sabha, Gandhi stayed for nearly 10 days on the Sabha's premises.\n\nGandhiji desired that the ‘Hindi Prachar‘ in the south should be carried on by involving the local people of the respective area. Until 1920, this Sabha had its office at George Town in Madras and after some years shifted to Mylapore and then to Triplicane where it functioned till 1936. In 1936, the Sabha shifted to its present headquarters at T. Nagar. Preliminary examinations were held regularly from 1922. The first degree-level examination ‘Rashtrabasha Visharad’ was conducted and convocation held in 1931, which was addressed by Kaka Kalelkar. The Sabha celebrated its silver jubilee in 1946 after the Second World War and Gandhiji presided over the celebrations. To commemorate his presence during the silver jubilee celebrations in the sabha and mark that historic occasion, it was decided to build a Gandhi Mantap at the celebration spot. Accordingly, a mantap was built and it was inaugurated in June 1963 by Morarji Desai.\n\nA landmark in the recent history of the Sabha was the establishment of the National Hindi Research Library built at a cost of 8.5 million, with financial assistance from the Government of India. Another important landmark is the building of ‘Mahatma Gandhi Convocation Hall’ (Mahatma Gandhi Padavidan Mantap) exclusively for the use of holding the annual convocation and other functions of the Sabha.\n\n\nThe Sabha is divided into four divisions, one each for the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.

These masses were written between about 1100 to 1700 by clerici vagantes (\"wandering clerics\"), with the first example being the gamblers mass (\"officium lusorum\"), found in the Carmina Burana. The genre is somewhat related to other medieval ecclesiastic parody, such as the Feast of Fools and the Feast of the Ass.\n\nThese parody masses generally follow line for line the words of the Latin Mass, as well as quotations from the Latin Vulgate. They are carefully reworded to create a parody of the Mass, with themes such as Bacchus, the god of wine, and Decius, the god of dice (Decius was also the name of a Roman emperor), replacing the \"Dominus\" and \"Deus\" (Lord and God) of the Mass. There is much imagery of dice being used in gambling, and of drinking cups, wine, and taverns, ending with losing all of one’s possessions, including clothes, through drinking and gambling.\n\n"}
{"id": "8378864", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8378864", "title": "Eskayan language", "text": "Eskayan language\n\nEskayan is an artificial auxiliary language of the Eskaya clan of Bohol, an island province of the Philippines. It is grammatically Boholano, the native language of Bohol, with a substituted lexicon. While Eskayan has no mother-tongue speakers, it is taught by volunteers in at least three cultural schools in the southeast interior of the province.\nEskayan has a number of idiosyncrasies that have attracted wide interest. One of its most immediately remarkable features is its unique writing system of over 1,000 syllabic characters, said to be modeled on parts of the human body, and its non-Philippine lexicon.\n\nThe earliest attested document in Eskayan provisionally dates from 1908, and was on display at the Bohol Museum until September 2006.\n\nAccording to speakers, the Eskaya language and script were creations of Pinay, the ancestor of the Eskaya clan, who was inspired by human anatomy. Pinay’s language was \"rediscovered\" in the early 20th century by Mariano Datahan (born Mariano Sumatra, ca. 1875–1949), a Messianic rebel soldier who transmitted it to his followers. Datahan had founded a utopian community in southeast Bohol in the aftermath of the Philippine–American War, in order to resist imperial claims and establish an indigenous nation in Bohol, and the Eskayan language and script were seen as the embodiment of this incipient national culture.\n\nRecent research strongly suggests that the Eskayan language was created in the period after Spanish contact had been established. Evidence of this includes the presence of \"native\" terms (i.e., not borrowed or calqued) for post-contact cultural categories such as \"pope\" and \"aeroplane\". Further, the language makes semantic distinctions that are made in Spanish and English but not in Visayan (such as between \"moon\" and \"month\"). It is highly plausible that Eskayan vocabulary was created by taking parallel Spanish-English-Visayan wordlists from textbooks, and replacing the Visayan layer with Eskayan. Finally, the Eskayan script bears strong similarities to 19th-century Copperplate handwriting.\n\nIndigenous auxiliary languages with accompanying creation myths are attested elsewhere in the world. One notable case is the Damin ceremonial language of the Gulf of Carpentaria which is said to have been the creation of the ancestor Kalthad; another are the pandanus languages of the Medan region of Papua New Guinea.\n\nEskayan is a \"sophisticated encryption\" of the Cebuano language. It shows no lexical similarity to any of the indigenous languages of the Philippines, apart from a very few Cebuano words. Grammatically, however, it is Cebuano. Most of the words were invented, though with inspiration from Spanish and English vocabulary and phonotactics. Some Spanish words had their meanings changed, such as \"astro\" 'sun' (from 'star') and \"tre\" 'two' (from 'three').\n\nDr. Ernie Constantino (Professor of the Linguistics Department of the University of the Philippines) argued that the Visayan-Eskaya ethnolanguage is only a constructed language whose phonology, grammar, and/or vocabulary have been consciously devised by an individual or group, instead of having evolved naturally. This ethnolanguage would then be comparable to Esperanto and Ido in origin, though not in purpose.\n\nThe Eskayan script has both alphabetic and syllabic components. A basic 'alphabet' of 46 characters accounts for most of the common sounds and syllables used in Eskayan while a broader subset totalling over 1000 is used to represent the remaining syllables. The unusual diversity of consonant and vowel clusters accounts for this relatively large number of composite characters, which even includes superfluous symbols.\nThe symbols are said to be based on parts of the human anatomy, though many are clearly based on the cursive Roman alphabet.\n\nA romanised form of Eskayan is used in the cultural schools for the purpose of exposition. Although not strictly standardised, this orthography has elements in common with the Spanish system once used for transliterating Cebuano. E.g., the letters and are interchangeable symbols representing the sound ; the ‘ll’ combination is pronounced and the letter will be pronounced when it precedes a front vowel, as in Spanish. A notable innovation in Eskayan romanised orthography is the letter combination ‘chd’ which represents the sound .\n\nEskayan shares all the same phonemes as Boholano-Visayan (the particular variety of Cebuano spoken on Bohol) and even includes the distinctive Boholano voiced palatal affricate that appears in Visayan words such as \"maayo\" (‘good’). With the exception of this phoneme, Eskayan shares the same basic phonology as Cebuano-Visayan, Tagalog and many other Philippine languages.\n\nThe phonotactics of Eskayan, on the other hand, are quite different from those of Boholano-Visayan and Philippine languages generally. This can be seen in Eskayan words such as \"bosdipir\" (‘eel’), \"guinposlan\" (‘face’), \"ilcdo\" (‘knee’) and \"estrapirado\" (‘flower’) that contain consonant sequences like , , , and which do not feature in Philippine languages. Furthermore, a significant number of Eskayan words have phonemic sequences that are common in Spanish or in Spanish loans into Boholano-Visayan but appear rarely, if ever, in non-borrowed words.\n\nEskayan conforms to the same syntactic and morphological structure as Cebuano. Accordingly, Eskayan nouns are uninflected but may be marked for case with one of several preceding case markers.\n\nThe table below shows the basic case system of Eskayan, with Cebuano equivalents in brackets.\n\"Kon\" and \"esto\" parallel Spanish \"con\" 'with' and \"esto\" 'that', approximate Spanish glosses for Cebuano \"ni\" and \"ang\".\n\nEskayan and Cebuano texts, which are always written face-to-face in the bilingual Eskayan books, generally have a one-to-one correspondence. For example:\n\nEskayan personal pronouns are also marked by case. In the table below, the Cebuano equivalents are indicated in brackets. (These pronouns are drawn from a limited corpus; omissions are indicated by [] and uncertainties with an asterisk.)\n\nDespite its structural equivalence to Eskayan, Cebuano has had a very limited lexical influence on the language. In a comparison of core Swadesh vocabulary, there are eight identifiable cognates.\nEskayan words have a one-to-one correspondence with Cebuano, so that when two words are homophones in Cebuano, they are homophones in Eskayan as well. However, the verbal morphology is quite different: Cebuano has twenty-four verbal affixes which indicate grammatical aspect and other feature, whereas Eskayan has just five \"(muy-, dil-, pur-, yu-, yi-)\", each of which can substitute for any of the Cebuano affixes. This often makes Eskayan grammar ambiguous, and dependent on the parallel Cebuano text. In addition, some Eskayan verbs are equivalent to specific inflections of Cebuano verbs despite not having any morphology. For example, Eskayan \"imprus\" 'was taken on', which is basic root, translates Cebuano \"gipuslan\", where \"gi-\" indicates that the action is completed and performed on the grammatical agent. This is likely because the prototype for many Eskayan words was an early English–Spanish–Visayan trilingual, with the Visayan (Cebuano) glosses crossed out and replaced with Eskayan.\n\nAlthough the Eskayan lexicon bears a marked Spanish influence, the loan-patterns are hard to map. Some Spanish words appear to have been directly borrowed into Eskayan with virtually no semantic or phonetic alterations. E.g., the Eskayan word \"merido\", meaning ‘husband’, is evidently loaned from the Spanish \"marido\", also meaning ‘husband’. Others retain only a few of the semantic properties of the original. E.g., the word \"astro\" means ‘sun’ in Eskayan but ‘star’ in Spanish. In some interesting cases Eskayan lexical items appear to be borrowed but are assigned new meanings entirely. E.g., the Eskayan \"memorya\" (‘sky’) does not coincide semantically with the Spanish \"memoria\" (‘memory’). One of the most intriguing examples of such an ‘interrupted loan’ is that of the Eskayan \"tre\" (‘two’) seemingly derived from the Spanish \"tres\" (‘three’). Here the semantic property of ‘number’ was retained but the actual quantity it represented was reassigned.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the Eskaya community attracted the interest of local mystics who promoted the notion that their language was of exotic origin. Today, the few linguists who have examined Eskayan generally concur that it is structurally Cebuano but lexically innovative, suggesting that Eskayan is an auxiliary language or a highly sophisticated form of disguised speech encoded from Cebuano.\n\n"}

{"id": "31868765", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31868765", "title": "Focusrite", "text": "Focusrite\n\nFocusrite plc (formerly Focusrite Audio Engineering Ltd.) is an English audio equipment manufacturer based in High Wycombe, England. Focusrite designs and markets audio interfaces, microphone preamps, consoles, analogue EQs and Channel strips, and digital audio processing hardware and software. Many, but not all, Focusrite products are manufactured for the company in China.\n\nFounded in 1985 by Rupert Neve, Focusrite's first contracts included a commission from Sir George Martin to build extensions to Air studios' custom Neve consoles, initially the vintage recording console in Martin's Air Montserrat studio in the Caribbean – specifically a no-compromise microphone preamplifier and equaliser.\n\nThe resulting module, named the Input Signal Amplifier (ISA) 110, consisted of a transformer-coupled microphone preamplifier, 4-band equaliser and high- and low-pass filters. The initial modules were delivered to Air Montserrat in 1987 and were very well received – as a result, Air London ordered several the following year. The ISA 110 was subsequently sold as an outboard system. The ISA130 was added to the range in 1988, a single-channel Comp/Limiter, De-Esser and Expander/Gate developed by Rupert Neve and Trevor Stride.\n\nFocusrite decided to use these designs as the basis of a complete recording console, and the Focusrite Forte console was developed as a result in 1988. The concept was simply to produce the highest-quality recording console available at the time, regardless of cost. The prohibitively expensive design limited the production to just two units, however, after which Focusrite fell into financial difficulties. One console was delivered to Master Rock studios in London and the other to Electric Lady in New York, remaining in use for many years. The original Focusrite logo with its musically inspired italic \"“ff”\" is actually that of the console, standing for \"Focusrite Forte\" (as well as the musical term \"fortissimo\", or \"very loud\").\n\nAudio industry veteran and co-founder of Soundcraft Electronics Ltd, Phil Dudderidge purchased the company's assets in April 1989, establishing Focusrite Audio Engineering Ltd and reissuing the original modules along with some new designs. The company also designed a new console, the Focusrite Studio Console, released in 1990.\n\nFocusrite saw a growing interest in the microphone preamplifier, EQ and dynamics capability of the console, and decided to spin those out into a new range of outboard modules so that the technology could be made available independently of the console itself. This became the Red Range, with distinctive red milled aluminium front panels, launched in 1993. Over subsequent years Focusrite introduced several ranges of outboard audio processors. The Blue range, aimed at mastering engineers, followed, then in 1996 the Green range, a series of lower-priced processors was launched, aimed at musicians and home and artist-owned recording facilities.\n\nThe Platinum range followed in 1998, with characteristic silver-fronted rack cases that combined more effective production design, lowering prices, with more advanced circuitry providing additional features, including not only mic pres and processing, but also a range of effects. The company also co-developed plugins and hardware for the popular Pro Tools range of digital audio workstation (DAW) systems.\n\nAt the same time, new derivatives of the original ISA range were developed, providing new features such as variable mic input impedances. The ISA range is still in production, now with the additional of digital conversion as well as analogue signal processing. The ISA design originally included both input and output transformers, the latter to allow driving long studio lines, but with the advent of on-board analogue to digital (A/D) conversion, this was dropped from the design.\n\nLate 2003 saw the introduction of the Liquid Channel. This unit combines analogue and digital technologies to emulate virtually any combination of classic mic preamp and compressor. At the same time, Focusrite launched another plug-in for Pro Tools, the Forte. This emulated the sound of the two key modules from Focusrite's beginnings, the ISA 110 EQ and ISA130 compressor from the original Forte console.\n\nIn August 2004, Focusrite acquired electronic instrument manufacturer Novation which became a subsidiary called Novation Digital Music Systems Ltd.\n\nA significant step for the company was the addition of the Saffire Firewire range of audio interfaces, the first being announced at NAMM in early 2005. This range has continued to expand, offering mic/line/instrument preamps and conversion in a number of configurations, and has more recently been joined by the Scarlett range of USB interfaces. Saffire is also available with real-time DSP-powered tracking and mixing capability designed for the home studio environment, providing compression and EQ for tracking, plus monitor reverb; it also includes VRM: Virtual Reference Monitoring technology. VRM allows a mix to be auditioned in a several different emulated environments – such as living room, bedroom studio and professional studio control room – with a selection of monitoring and other loudspeakers, by listening on headphones. The VRM Box is also available, a USB headphone amplifier with DSP software for monitor emulation.\nLate 2010 saw Focusrite return to the plug-in arena with the release of the Midnight plug-in suite. This utilizes powerful DSP technology to exactly model the classic Focusrite ISA110 equaliser and ISA130 compressor, even including high-resolution front-panel emulations reminiscent of the hardware units. The ISA110 and 130 modules were created for the Forté console in the 1980s.\n\nOn 12 December 2014, Focusrite was floated on the AIM market as Focusrite plc.\n\nISA 110 Mic Pre & Equalizer (1987/89) The original ISA 110 module was designed by Rupert Neve to be vertically mounted and fit into the existing rack format of the Neve console at George Martin’s Air Montserrat studio. It consisted of a transformer-coupled microphone preamplifier based around a transformer supplied by Lundahl of Sweden, 4-band equaliser and high- and low-pass filters and was named the Input Signal Amplifier (ISA) 110. The design was based on the 31106 EQ module designed for the A7971 console by Rupert Neve, incorporating suggestions from Sir George Martin and engineer Geoff Emerick. The first modules were delivered in 1987. The ISA 110 was subsequently made publicly available as an outboard system consisting of rack, external power supply and ISA module, which sold for approximately $7,000 US.\n\nISA 130 VCA Comp/Limiter, De-Esser & Expander Gate (1987/89) The ISA 130 was introduced in 1988 for George Martin’s Air Montserrat console. It was again a vertical unit designed to fit into the original ISA rack or into a console. Developed by Rupert Neve and Trevor Stride, it comprised a single-channel, VCA-based Comp/Limiter, De-Esser and Expander/Gate.\n\nFocusrite Forté Console (1988) The Focusrite Forté console was developed in 1988 as a result of interest in the ISA modules. The concept was simply to produce the highest-quality recording console available at the time, regardless of cost, based around the signal path of the existing modular units.\n\nFocusrite Studio Console (1990–6) Following Phil Dudderidge’s acquisition of Focusrite in 1989 and the reissue of the original modules, the company re-examined the concept of a recording console, determined to maintain the original signal path of the Forté but employing a revised mechanical design and construction that made it easier to manufacture and install, reducing the cost. The result was the Focusrite Studio Console, released in 1990. Ten Studio Consoles were built, and several are still in use today.\n\nISA 215 Dual Mic Pre & Equaliser (1993) Launched in 1993, the ISA 215 Dual Mono mic pre and equaliser replaced the ISA115, and included two horizontal ISA 110 modules (with transformer-coupled microphone preamplifier, 4-band equaliser and high- and low-pass filters) mounted in a case with an internal power supply.\n\nThe Red Range (1993) The Red Range was based on the successful ISA 110 and ISA 130 products and retained the original Focusrite Ltd circuit designs. With two exceptions, the range consisted of combinations of these basic building blocks. The products featured transformer-balanced I/O, and aluminium cases to limit RFI sensitivity. In addition, the range featured solid, milled, red-anodised aluminium front panels that gave them a very distinctive appearance. Red 3 received a TEC Award in 1995 and Red 7 following it in 1996.\n\nThe Blue Range (1995) In 1995, Focusrite launched a special new range aimed exclusively at mastering facilities, with features such as switched-position, easily resettable controls that could be annotated easily. The Blue range, as it was called, was developed in conjunction with leading mastering engineers.\n\nd2 and d3 Plugins – Equaliser and Comp/Limiter (1995) In 1995, Focusrite moved into a new area for the company, in the form of a collaboration with Digidesign (now Avid Audio) on the development of two software plugins for the market-leading Pro Tools digital audio workstation environment. These were the first software plugins to not only emulate the processing capabilities of a piece of hardware, but also their look and feel: Focusrite d2 is a high-quality digital equaliser based on the Focusrite Red 2 Equaliser, whose design can be traced back to Rupert Neve; while d3 emulates the Red 3 Compressor/limiter. Both are still available at the time of writing (April 2013). These plugins included modelling of a suitably red front-panel with controls like those on the physical products, plus a large graph display showing how the plugin was configured – not something that would have been possible to do on the hardware.\n\nThe Green Range (1996) Introduced in 1996, the idea behind the range was to make high quality audio processors available to the project studio owner, with lower price-points than previous Focusrite products. It also employed distinctive sculpted green front panels. Cost reductions were achieved primarily by re-evaluating construction techniques, using a single circuit board and surface-mount components, the latter allowing automated production. Some less-used features were omitted; expensive display components such as analogue meters were replaced by LEDs, while in the mic pre area, Focusrite moved away from the transformer-based approach for these units to offer a transformerless, electronically balanced design.\n\nThe Platinum Range (1998) The Platinum range, with its silver-fronted rack cases, managed to reduce price points still further as a result of extensive production engineering, and while it retained the Focusrite transparency and purity, it also provided functionality to allow a range of effects too – adding a radical new dimension to Focusrite products. Designer Rob Jenkins stated that while previous Focusrite products had been aimed at studio engineers, the Platinum range targeted the recording musician, describing them as \"results-orientated\", with controls named after their effects rather than their engineering function.\n\nISA 430 (1999) The ISA 430 brought together the circuitry of the original ISA110, with its transformer-based mic and line inputs, HPF/LPF and parametric EQ section, with the ISA 130 compressor/limiter and expander/gate, designed by Trevor Stride and Rupert Neve, which later appeared in the Red 3. In addition to uniting these two units in the same 2U enclosure, ISA 430 introduced additional features such as an optional 24/96 A/D converter with synch to Pro Tools’ Superclock and other sources. A dedicated insert could be placed in three locations in the signal path (after the preamp, pre-EQ; between EQ and dynamics; and after EQ and dynamics but before the main output). EQ and dynamics sections could be swapped, and the unit could run as a single channel path nor be split into two independent processors with separate EQ and dynamics. An upgraded Class A VCA design was used in the compressor, though the sidechain was identical to that in the original ISA 130. Both a VU Meter and LED bar metering was included, the latter for use with the A/D. An improved de-esser design was included and a \"frequency adaptive\" optical limiter.\n\nControl|24 (2000) The year 2000 saw the launch of a second joint project with Digidesign: the Control|24 hardware control surface for Pro Tools. This ergonomically designed control surface aimed to include the vast majority of functionality of Digidesign's flagship ProControl, but at a significantly lower price. It also included 16 Focusrite mic pres, allowing it to be used for tracking with no additional hardware, a built-in stereo submixer and flexible surround-capable monitoring.\n\nPlatinum Penta (2001) March 2001 saw the release of the Platinum Penta. Designed specifically to complement a digital audio workstation, the Penta provided front-panel mic and instrument inputs, a Class A mic pre, and a stereo compressor featuring 16 presets accessed by buttons for different common applications, both for individual instruments and the entire mix. It also included a \"Tube Sound\" emulator and spatial enhancer. At the end of that year, another product in the high-end ISA range was introduced, the ISA220 \"Session Pack\". This 2U unit included many of the features of the ISA430, including mic pre, mic/line/instrument inputs, parametric EQ, dynamics and optical de-esser, plus an optional A/D. It also included a \"Blend\" control, which allowed the compressor's input signal to be mixed with the compressor output.\n\nMbox (2001) Launched in 2001 was another collaboration between Focusrite and Digidesign, in the form of the Mbox. Digidesign had approached Focusrite to develop a low-cost USB-based audio interface designed to complement the Pro Tools LE entry-level DAW. The dual-channel, USB-powered Mbox featured Focusrite mic pres with phantom capability, line/instrument ins and outs and headphone out, and 24-bit conversion. It featured zero-latency monitoring via a control to listen to a mix of input and playback.\n\nLiquid Channel (2003) Unveiled at the 115th Audio Engineering Society Convention in November 2003 was the Liquid Channel. This unit combines analogue and digital technologies to emulate virtually any combination of classic mic preamp and compressor. At the front end is an extensive analogue microphone preamplifier, which allows the relationship between mic and preamp to be precisely defined: the first step in emulation. Then a DSP-based sampling/emulation system, licensed from Sintefex Audio, comes into play, which uses ‘Dynamic Convolution’ techniques based on actual measurements of classic compressors, to re-synthesise their behaviour. In addition there is a control to vary the amount of second harmonic distortion. The front panel is entirely digital, and as a result all the unit’s settings can be saved in the unit’s 99 memories. Additional emulations can be added to the 40 on-board sets, and existing sets archived, via USB. The output side includes a 192 kHz A/D.\n\nSaffire Firewire Audio Interface (2005) The Saffire Firewire range of audio interfaces marked a major step forward for Focusrite, the first being announced at NAMM in early 2005. The original Saffire, designed as a compact, portable desktop unit with vertical form factor, included a Firewire 400 interface with on-board digital signal processing, and was based around a 24-bit, 192 kHz A/D-D/A. Four inputs were provided, two Focusrite mic preamps and S/PDIF I/O. Eight balanced outputs enabled the creation of separate headphone and monitor mixes or surround-sound monitoring. MIDI I/O was also included. Along with the hardware came SaffireControl, a suite of plug-ins delivering compression, EQ, amplifier modelling, and reverb for the monitor path, along with multiple stereo mix capability, also available on playback in VST or AU format for use with the host DAW system.\n\nSaffire PRO 24 DSP Audio Interface (2009) In July 2009, a new member of the Saffire range of interfaces was released, with the addition of a completely new feature. The Focusrite Saffire PRO 24 DSP is a 16 in / 8 out FireWire audio interface, featuring real-time DSP-powered tracking and mixing capability designed for the home studio environment. The unit provides DSP-powered compression and EQ for ultra-low-latency tracking, plus monitor reverb; it also includes VRM: Virtual Reference Monitoring technology. This uses dynamic convolution technology, as included in the Liquid series of products, but this time it is used to emulate monitoring systems. As a result, VRM allows a mix to be auditioned in a several different environments – such as living room, bedroom studio and professional studio control room – with a wide selection of monitoring and other loudspeakers, all by listening on headphones.\n\nSaffire 6 USB Audio Interface (2009) September 2009 saw the Saffire range extend from Firewire to USB, with the introduction of the Focusrite Saffire 6 USB, a two-in/four-out USB audio interface. It includes dual award-winning Focusrite mic preamps as in the rest of the Saffire range. The two-in, four-out configuration is also perfect for laptop DJs who need to be able to cue up material, or send two different signals to either side of a DJ mixer. It also includes MIDI I/O. Saffire 6 USB is supplied with a range of software, including Ableton Live Lite 8, Focusrite sister company Novation's Bass Station synthesizer and over a gigabyte of samples. In addition the package includes the Focusrite FX Suite, which includes a compressor, gate, reverb and EQ for AU/VST operation.\n\nISA One Single-channel microphone preamplifier with independent DI (2010) The ISA One included the traditional Focusrite ISA transformer-based preamp from the ISA 110, now with four switchable impedances, in a rugged and portable chassis. The preamp is complemented by a line input and an independent D.I. channel, complete with dedicated gain control, active or passive impedance switch, a TRS Jack output for routing to an amp and an independent XLR output on the rear. Its ideal for both vocal and instrument recording. An optional 24/192 A/D converter card can be added. The unit is also available with the card pre-installed, as the ISA One Digital.\n\nForte is a 2 in, 4 out portable USB audio interface for Mac and Windows, designed to deliver analogue sources to DAWs. It features two remote-controlled mic preamps with digital conversion at up to 24-bit/192 kHz resolution. Built into a solid aluminium case, Forte features a colour OLED display, touch controls and a single large control knob, with DAW control integration.\n\nVRM Box is a small square box containing a USB-based bus-powered headphone monitoring amplifier allowing mixes to be monitored at high quality. In addition, software is provided that runs on the host computer to provide the ability to emulate a wide range of monitor loudspeakers in various room environments from studio monitoring to consumer listening. VRM is the same technology as available in the Saffire PRO 24 interface.\n\nRedNet is Focusrite’s flagship range of modular Ethernet-networked audio interfaces that harnesses the power of Audinate's tried and tested Dante digital audio networking system to bring studio quality sound to any modern audio application. Fundamentally RedNet is an extremely scalable, near zero latency audio distribution system that can be used to expand I/O channel count, interface digital components, and/or bridge between Pro Tools|HD or MADI and the Dante audio network. The technology enables a single link on the network to handle up to 512 input and output channels at 48 kHz.\n\niTrack Solo is an interface for recording instruments and vocals using an Apple iPad. Featuring a Focusrite microphone pre-amplifier and an input to record directly from electric and bass guitars, iTrack Solo is compatible with iOS-based music-making app. It is also fully compatible with PC or Macintosh computers and is supplied with music making software including Ableton Live Lite and the Focusrite Scarlett Plug-in Suite.\nPhil Dudderidge\n\nhttp://audiotechgear.net\n\n"}
{"id": "11478", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11478", "title": "Free verse", "text": "Free verse\n\nFree verse is an open form of poetry. It does not use consistent meter patterns, rhyme, or any musical pattern.\n\nPoets have explained that free verse is not totally free: \"Its only freedom is from the tyrant demands of the metered line.\" Free verse displays some elements of form. Most free verse maintains the poetic convention of the poetic line to some degree, at least in written representations, Donald Hall goes as far as to say that \"the \"form\" of free verse is as binding and as liberating as the \"form\" of a rondeau,\" and T. S. Eliot wrote, \"No verse is free for the man who wants to do a good job.\" \n\nKenneth Allott, the poet and critic, said the adoption by some poets of \"vers libre\" arose from \"mere desire for novelty, the imitation of Whitman, the study of Jacobean dramatic blank verse, and the awareness of what French poets had already done to the alexandrine in France.\" The American critic John Livingston Lowes in 1916 observed \"Free verse may be written as very beautiful prose; prose may be written as very beautiful free verse. Which is which?\"\n\nSome poets have considered free verse restrictive in its own way. In 1922, Robert Bridges voiced his reservations in the essay \"Humdrum and Harum-Scarum.\" William Carlos Williams said, \"Being an art form, verse cannot be free in the sense of having no limitations or guiding principles.\" Yvor Winters, the poet and critic, said, \"The free verse that is really verse, the best that is, of W.C. Williams, H. D., Marianne Moore, Wallace Stevens, and Ezra Pound is the antithesis of free.\"\n\nAs the French-language term \"vers libre\" suggests, this technique of using more irregular cadences is often said to have its origin in the practices of 19th-century French poets such as Gustave Kahn and Jules Laforgue in his \"Derniers vers\" of 1890. Taupin, the US-based French poet and critic, concluded that free verse and \"vers libre\" are not synonymous, since \"the French language tends to give equal weight to each spoken syllable, whereas English syllables vary in quantity according to whether stressed or unstressed.\"\n\nThe sort of cadencing that we now recognize in free verse can be traced back at least as far as the Biblical Hebrew psalmist poetry of the Bible. By referring to the , it is possible to argue that free verse in English first appeared in the 1380s in the John Wycliffe translation of the Psalms and was repeated in different form in most biblical translations ever since. \n\nWalt Whitman, who based his long lines in his poetry collection \"Leaves of Grass\" on the phrasing of the King James Bible, influenced later American free verse composers, notably Allen Ginsberg. One form of free verse was employed by Christopher Smart in his long poem \"Jubilate Agno\" (Latin: \"Rejoice in the Lamb\") , written some time between 1759 and 1763 but not published until 1939.\n\nMany poets of the Victorian era experimented with free verse. Christina Rossetti, Coventry Patmore, and T. E. Brown all wrote examples of rhymed but unmetered verse, poems such as W. E. Henley's \"Discharged\" (from his \"In Hospital\" sequence). \n\nFree verse in English was persuasively advocated by critic T. E. Hulme in his \"A Lecture on Modern Poetry\" (1908). Later in the preface to \"Some Imagist Poets\" 1916, he comments, \"Only the name is new, you will find something much like \"vers libre\" in Dryden's \"Threnodia Augustalis\"; a great deal of Milton's \"Samson Agonistes\", and the oldest in Chaucer's \"House of Fame\".\"\n\nIn France, a few pieces in Arthur Rimbaud's prose poem collection \"Illuminations\" were arranged in manuscript in lines, rather than prose, and in the Netherlands, tachtiger (i.e., a member of the 1880s generation of innovative poets) Frederik van Eeden employed the form at least once' in his poem \"Waterlelie\" (\"Water Lily\").\n\nGoethe—particularly in some early poems, such as \"Prometheus\"—and Hölderlin used free verse occasionally, due in part to a misinterpretation of the meter used in Pindar's poetry; in Hölderlin's case, he also continued to write unmetered poems after discovering this error. \n\nThe German poet Heinrich Heine made an important contribution to the development of free verse with 22 poems, written in two-poem cycles, called \"Die Nordsee\" (\"The North Sea\") (written 1825-1826). These were first published in \"Buch der Lieder\" (\"Book of Songs\") in 1827.\n\nAlthough free verse requires no meter, rhyme, or other traditional poetic techniques, a poet can still use them to create some sense of structure. A clear example of this can be found in Walt Whitman's poems, where he repeats certain phrases and uses commas to create both a rhythm and structure. \n\nPattern and discipline is to be found in good free verse: the internal pattern of sounds, the choice of exact words, and the effect of associations give free verse its beauty. With the Imagists free verse became a discipline and acquired status as a legitimate poetic form. Herbert Read, however, noted that \"the Imagist Ezra Pound gave free verse its musical structure to an extent that parodoxically it was no longer free.\"\n\nUnrestrained by traditional boundaries, Yvor Winters described this as \"attempts to widen experience by establishing 'abnormal' conventions,\" the poet possesses more license to express, and has more control over the development of the poem. This can allow for a more spontaneous and individualized poetic art product.\n\nTechnically, free verse has been described as spaced prose, a mosaic of verse and prose experience.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "36092394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36092394", "title": "Grand Festivities Square", "text": "Grand Festivities Square\n\nGreat Celebrations square is the main square for public celebrations in Baghdad with a stadium for the heads of the state in the center of the Parade avenue. The square is home to three important public monuments created by leading mid-20th century sculptors. \n\nIn 1986 (two years before the war's end) the Iraqi Ba'athist government began construction of a festival and parade ground in Zawra Park, near the extensive presidential complex in the center of Baghdad. \nThe square is located near the Harthiya and in the fortified Green Zone, and the site was specifically selected for its symbolic value. Iraqis generally believe it is the same location where the Muslim Arabs defeated the Persians in 636 CE and this historic event is seen to be the beginning of Islamic domination of the region. The site was intended to become the place where military parades and national events would be held. Known as \"Grand Festivities Square\", it comprised a large parade ground, an extensive review pavilion and a large reflecting pool. The surrounding grassy areas hosted Iraqis during military parades. Adding to the festive appeal of the grounds were three refreshments booths that sold ice cream, cold beverages, and candy.\n\nThe then leader of Iraq, Saddam Hussein commissioned three major public artworks for the area. These artworks were to be memorials to Iraq's fallen soldiers, a remembrance of Iraq's pain and suffering as a consequence of the Iran-Iraq war and symbols of Iraq's victory in the war. The \"Monument to the Unknown Soldier,\" based on a concept by Iraqi sculptor, Khaled al-Rahal, and situated just beyond the perimeter of the Square, had already opened in 1982. Another major work, the colossal, \"Al-Shaheed Monument\" designed by Iraqi sculptor, Ismail Fatah Al Turk, and situated on the river bank had been inaugurated in 1983. Hussein commissioned a third monument, the \"Victory Arches,\" another concept by the sculptor, Khaled Al-Rahal, to be built in the same vicinity and it was inaugurated in 1989. \n\nThe Victory Arches mark the entrances to the Square. On the day the Arches were dedicated (8 August, 1989), Saddam rode under the arches astride a white horse. It is generally acknowledged that Hussein intended to cast an allusion to the slain Shiite martyr Hussein, killed in Karbala in 680 CE, whose death caused the rift between Shiite and Sunni Muslims. The monument, although presenting a triumphalist narrative in relation to the Iran-Iraq war, has assumed a broader symbolism and represents those Iraqis who fell in any war throughout the country's history.\n\nThe three monuments in the vicinity of the square form a visual and symbolic unit. The construction of the three artworks was part of a broader Ba'athist government program to beautify Baghdad, instil a sense of national pride, and at the same time immortalise Sadam Hussein's reputation as a powerful leader. \n\nThe Square has become a place for public demonstrations and protests. In April-May, 2016, following a protracted political struggle between to end sectarianism in politics, a large crowd gathered at Grand Festivities Square in a non-violent protest. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "1232022", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1232022", "title": "Green Knight", "text": "Green Knight\n\nThe Green Knight is a character of the 14th-century Arthurian poem \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\" and the related medieval work \"The Greene Knight\". His true name is revealed to be Bertilak de Hautdesert (an alternate spelling in some translations is \"Bercilak\" or \"Bernlak\") in \"Sir Gawain\", while \"The Greene Knight\" names him \"Bredbeddle\". The Green Knight later features as one of Arthur's greatest champions in the fragmentary ballad \"King Arthur and King Cornwall\", again with the name \"Bredbeddle\". In \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\", Bercilak is transformed into the Green Knight by Morgan le Fay, a traditional adversary of King Arthur, in order to test his court. In \"The Green Knight\" he is transformed by a different woman for the same purpose. In both stories he sends his wife to seduce Gawain as a further test. \"King Arthur and King Cornwall\" portrays him as an exorcist and one of the most powerful knights of Arthur's court.\n\nIn \"Sir Gawain\", the Green Knight is so called because his skin and clothes are green. The meaning of his greenness has puzzled scholars since the discovery of the poem, who identify him variously as the Green Man, a vegetation being of medieval art; a recollection of a figure from Celtic mythology; a Christian symbol; or the Devil himself. The medieval scholar C. S. Lewis said the character was \"as vivid and concrete as any image in literature.\" J. R. R. Tolkien called him the \"most difficult character\" to interpret in the introduction to his edition of \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\". His major role in Arthurian literature includes being a judge and tester of knights, and as such the other characters consider him as friendly but terrifying and somewhat mysterious.\n\nThe earliest appearance of the Green Knight is in the late 14th century alliterative poem \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\", which survives in only one manuscript along with other poems by the same author, the so-called Pearl Poet. This poet was a contemporary of Geoffrey Chaucer, writer of \"The Canterbury Tales\", although the two wrote in different parts of England. The later poem, \"The Greene Knight\", is a late medieval rhyming romance that likely predates its only surviving copy: the 17th-century Percy Folio. The other work featuring the Green Knight, the later ballad \"King Arthur and King Cornwall\", also survives only in the Percy Folio manuscript. Its date of composition is conjectural; it may be a version of an earlier story, though it is also possibly a product of the 17th century.\n\nIn \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\", the Green Knight appears before Arthur's court during a Christmas feast, holding a bough of holly in one hand and a battle axe in the other. Despite disclaim of war, the knight issues a challenge: he will allow one man to strike him once with his axe, with the condition that he return the blow the next year. At first, Arthur accepts the challenge, but Gawain takes his place and decapitates the Green Knight, who retrieves his head, reattaches it and tells Gawain to meet him at the Green Chapel at the stipulated time.\n\nThe Knight features next as Bercilak de Hautedesert, lord of a large castle, Gawain's host before his arrival at the Green Chapel. At Bercilak's castle, Gawain is submitted to tests of his loyalty and chastity, wherein Bercilak sends his wife to seduce Gawain and arranges that each time Bercilak gains prey in hunting, or Gawain any gift in the castle, each shall exchange his gain for the other's. At New Year's Day, Gawain departs to the Green Chapel, and bends to receive his blow, only to have the Green Knight feint two blows, then barely nick him on the third. He then reveals that he is Bercilak, and that Morgan le Fay had given him the double identity to test Gawain and Arthur.\n\n\"The Greene Knight\" tells the same story as \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\", with a few differences. Notably, the knight, here named \"Bredbeddle\", is only wearing green, not green-skinned himself. The poem also states the knight has been asked by his wife's mother (not Morgan in this version) to trick Gawain. He agrees because he knows his wife is secretly in love with Gawain, and hopes to deceive both. Gawain falters in accepting a girdle from her, and the Green Knight's purpose is fulfilled in a small sense. In the end, he acknowledges Gawain's ability and asks to accompany him to Arthur's court.\n\nIn \"King Arthur and King Cornwall\", the Green Knight again features as Bredbeddle, and is depicted as one of Arthur's knights. He offers to help Arthur fight a mysterious sprite (controlled by the magician, King Cornwall) which has entered his chamber. When physical attacks fail, Bredbeddle uses a sacred text to subdue it. The Green Knight eventually gains so much control over the sprite through this text that he convinces it to take a sword and strike off its master's head.\n\nThe name \"Bertilak\" may derive from \"bachlach\", a Celtic word meaning \"churl\" (i.e. rogueish, unmannerly), or from \"bresalak\", meaning \"contentious\". The Old French word \"bertolais\" translates as \"Bertilak\" in the Arthurian tale \"Merlin\" from the Lancelot-Grail Cycle of Arthurian legend. Notably, the 'Bert-' prefix means 'bright', and the '-lak' can mean either 'lake' or \"play, sport, fun, etc\". \"Hautdesert\" probably comes from a mix of both Old French and Celtic words meaning \"High Wasteland\" or \"High Hermitage\". It may also have an association with \"desirete\" meaning \"disinherited\" (i.e. from the Round Table).\n\nCharacters similar to the Green Knight appear in several other works. In Thomas Malory's \"Le Morte d'Arthur\", for example, Gawain's brother Gareth defeats four brothers in different coloured armour, including a \"Grene Knyght\", Sir Partolope. The three who survive the encounter eventually join the Round Table and appear several further times in the text. The stories of Saladin feature a certain \"Green Knight\"; a Sicilian warrior in a shield vert and a helmet adorned with stag horns. Saladin tries to make him part of his personal guard.\nSimilarly, a \"Chevalier Vert\" appears in the Chronicle of Ernoul during the recollection of events following the capture of Jerusalem in 1187; here, he is identified as a Spanish knight who earned this nickname from the Muslims due to his eccentric apparel.\n\nTaking this into consideration, scientists have considered an association with Islamic tales. The figure of Al-Khidr () in the Qur'an is called the \"Green Man\" because he obtain immortality as the only man to have drunk the water of life which in some versions of the story turns him green. He tests Moses three times by doing seemingly evil acts, which are eventually revealed to be noble deeds to prevent greater evils or reveal great goods. Both the Arthurian Green Knight and Al-Khidr serve as teachers to holy and upright men (Gawain/Moses), who thrice tested their faith and obedience. It has been suggested that the character of the Green Knight may be a literary descendant of Al-Khidr, brought to Europe with the Crusaders and blended with Celtic and Arthurian imagery.\n\nThe beheading game appears in a number of tales, the earliest being the Middle Irish tale \"Bricriu's Feast\". The challenger in this story is named \"Fear\", a \"bachlach\" (churl), and is identified as Cú Roí (a superhuman king of Munster in the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology) in disguise. He challenges three warriors to his game, only to have them run from the return blow, until the hero Cú Chulainn accepts the challenge. With Cú Chulainn under his axe, this antagonist also feints three blows before letting the hero go. In the Irish version, the cloak of the churl is described as grey (glas), which may also mean green. In the \"Life of Caradoc\", a Middle French narrative embedded in the anonymous First Continuation of Chrétien de Troyes' \"Perceval, the Story of the Grail\", another similar challenge is issued. In this story, a notable difference is that Caradoc's challenger is his father in disguise, come to test his honour. The French romances \"La Mule sans Frein\" and \"Hunbaut\" and the Middle High German epic poem \"Diu Crone\" feature Gawain in beheading game situations. \"Hunbaut\" furnishes an interesting twist: Gawain cuts off the man's head, and then pulls off his magic cloak before he can replace it, causing his death. A similar story, this time attributed to Lancelot, appears in the 13th century French work \"Perlesvaus\".\n\nThe 15th-century \"The Turke and Gowin\" begins with a Turk entering Arthur's court and asking, \"Is there any will, as a brother, To give a buffett and take another?\" Gawain accepts the challenge, and is then forced to follow the Turk until he decides to return the blow. Through the many adventures they have together, the Turk, out of respect, asks the knight to cut off the Turk's head, which Gawain does. The Turk, surviving, then praises Gawain and showers him with gifts. \"Sir Gawain and the Carle of Carlisle\" contains a scene in which the Carl, a lord, orders Gawain to strike him with his spear, and bends over to receive the blow. Gawain obliges, the Carl rises, laughing and unharmed, and, unlike in \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\", no return blow is demanded or given. Among all these stories, \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\" is the only one with a completely green character, and the only one tying Morgan le Fay to his transformation.\n\nSeveral stories also feature knights struggling to stave off the advances of voluptuous women, including \"Yder\", the Lancelot-Grail Cycle, \"Hunbaut\", and \"The Knight of the Sword\". The Green Knight parallel in these stories is a King testing a knight as to whether or not he will remain chaste in extreme circumstances. The woman he sends is sometimes his wife (as in \"Yder\"), if he knows that she is unfaithful and will tempt other men; in \"The Knight of the Sword\" the king sends his beautiful daughter. All characters playing the Green Knight's role kill unfaithful knights who fail their tests.\n\nIn English folklore and literature, green has traditionally been used to symbolize nature and its embodied attributes, namely those of fertility and rebirth. Critics have claimed that the Green Knight's role emphasizes the environment outside of human habitation. With his alternate identity as Bertilak, the Green Knight can also be seen as a compromise between both humanity and the environment as opposed to Gawain's representation of human civilization. Oftentimes it is used to embody the supernatural or spiritual other world. In British folklore, the devil was sometimes considered to be green which may or may not play into the concept of the Green Man/ Wild Man dichotomy of the Green Knight. Stories of the medieval period also portray the colour as representing love and the amorous in life, and the base, natural desires of man. Green is also known to have signified witchcraft, devilry and evil for its association with the fairies and spirits of early English folklore and for its association with decay and toxicity. The colour, when combined with gold, is sometimes seen as representing the fading of youth. In the Celtic tradition, green was avoided in clothing for its superstitious association with misfortune and death. Green can be considered in \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\" as signifying a transformation from good to evil and back again; displaying both the spoiling and regenerative connotations of the colour. Given these varied and even contradictory interpretations of the colour green, its precise meaning in the poem remains ambiguous.\n\nOf the many characters similar to him, the Green Knight of \"Sir Gawain\" is the first to be green. Because of his strange colour, some scholars believe him to be a manifestation of the Green Man figure of medieval art, or as a representation of both the vitality and fearful unpredictability of nature. That he carries a green holly branch, and the comparison of his beard to a bush, has guided many scholars to this interpretation. The gold entwined in the cloth wrapped around his axe, combined with the green, gives him both a wild and an aristocratic air. Others consider him as being an incarnation of the Devil. In one interpretation, it is thought that the Green Knight, as the \"Lord of Hades\", has come to challenge the noble knights of King Arthur's court. Sir Gawain, the bravest of the knights, therefore proves himself equal to Hercules in challenging the Knight, tying the story to ancient Greek mythology. Scholars like Curely claim the descriptive features of the Green Knight suggest a servitude to Satan such as the beaver-hued beard alluding to the allegorical significance of beavers for the Christian audience of the time who believed that they renounced the world and paid \"tribute to the devil for spiritual freedom.\" Another possible interpretation of the Green Knight views him as combining elements from the Greek Hades and the Christian Messiah, at once representing both good and evil and life and death as self-proliferating cycles. This interpretation embraces the positive and negative attributes of the colour green and relates to the enigmatic motif of the poem. The description of the Green Knight upon his entrance to Arthur's Court as \"from neck to loin… strong and thickly made\" is considered by some scholars as homoerotic.\n\nC.S. Lewis declared the Green Knight \"as vivid and concrete as any image in literature\" and further described him as:\n\na living \"coincidentia oppositorum\"; half giant, yet wholly a \"lovely\" knight\"; as full of demoniac energy as old Karamazov, yet in his own house, as jolly as a Dickensian Christmas host; now exhibiting a ferocity so gleeful that it is almost genial, and now a geniality so outrageous that it borders on the ferocious; half boy or buffoon in his shouts and laughter and jumpings; yet at the end judging Gawain with the tranquil superiority of an angelic being \nThe Green Knight could also be interpreted as a blend of two traditional figures in romance and medieval narratives, namely, \"the literary green man\" and the \"literary wild man.\" \"The literary green man\" signifies \"youth, natural vitality, and love,\" whereas the \"literary wild man\" represents the \"hostility to knighthood,\" \"the demonic\" and \"death.\" The Knight's green skin connects the green of the costume to the green of the hair and beard, thus connecting the green man's pleasant manners and significance into the wild man's grotesque qualities.\n\nThe Green Knight is also compared to the English holiday figure Jack in the green. Jack is part of a May Day holiday tradition in some parts of England, but his connection to the Knight is found mainly in the Derbyshire tradition of Castleton Garland. In this tradition, a kind of Jack in the green known as the Garland King is led through the town on a horse, wearing a bell-shaped garland of flowers that covers his entire upper body, and followed by young girls dressed in white, who dance at various points along the route (formerly the town's bellringers, who still make the garland, also performed this role). On the top of the King's garland is the \"queen\", a posy of bright flowers. The King is also accompanied by his elegantly dressed female consort (nowadays, confusingly, also known as the Queen); played by a woman during recent times, until 1956 \"the Woman\" was always a man in woman's clothing. At the end of the ceremony, the queen posy is taken off the garland, to be placed on the town's war memorial. The Garland King then rides to the church tower where the garland is hauled up the side of the tower and impaled upon a pinnacle. Due to the nature imagery associated with the Green Knight, the ceremony has been interpreted as possibly deriving from his famous beheading in the \"Gawain\" poem. In this case, the posy's removal would symbolise the loss of the knight's head.\n\nIn the poem \"Gawain\", when the Knight is beheaded, he tells Gawain to meet him at the Green Chapel, saying that all nearby know where it is. Indeed, the guide which is to bring Gawain there from Bertilak's castle grows very fearful as they near it and begs Gawain to turn back. The final meeting at the Green Chapel has caused many scholars to draw religious connections, with the Knight fulfilling a priestly role with Gawain as a penitent. The Green Knight ultimately, in this interpretation, judges Gawain to be a worthy knight, and lets him live, playing a priest, God, and judge all at once.\n\nThe Chapel is considered by Gawain as an evil place: foreboding, \"the most accursed church\", \"the place for the Devil to recite matins\"; but when the mysterious Knight allows Gawain to live, Gawain immediately assumes the role of penitent to a priest or judge, as in a genuine church. The Green Chapel may also be related to tales of fairy hills or knolls of earlier Celtic literature. Some scholars have wondered whether \"Hautdesert\" refers to the Green Chapel, as it means \"High Hermitage\"; but such a connection is doubted by most scholars. As to the location of the Chapel, in the \"Greene Knight\" poem, Sir Bredbeddle's living place is described as \"the castle of hutton\", causing some scholars to suggest a connection with Hutton Manor House in Somerset. Gawain's journey leads him directly into the centre of the Pearl Poet's dialect region, where the candidates for the locations of the Castle at Hautdesert and the Green Chapel stand. Hautdesert is thought to be in the area of Swythamley in northwest Midland, as it is in the writer's dialect area, and matches the land features described in the poem. The area is also known to have housed all of the animals hunted by Bertilak (deer, boar, fox) in the 14th century. The Green Chapel is thought to be in either Lud's Church or Wetton Mill, as these areas closely match the descriptions given by the author. Ralph Elliott for example located the chapel the knight searches for near (\"two myle henne\" v1078) the old manor house at Swythamley Park at the bottom of a valley (\"bothm of the brem valay\" v2145) on a hillside (\"loke a littel on the launde, on thi lyfte honde\" v2147) in a large fissure (\"an olde caue,/or a creuisse of an olde cragge\" v2182-83).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "187273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=187273", "title": "Han unification", "text": "Han unification\n\nHan unification is an effort by the authors of Unicode and the Universal Character Set to map multiple character sets of the so-called CJK languages into a single set of unified characters. Han characters are a common feature of written Chinese (hanzi), Japanese (kanji), and Korean (hanja).\n\nModern Chinese, Japanese and Korean typefaces typically use regional or historical variants of a given Han character. In the formulation of Unicode, an attempt was made to unify these variants by considering them different glyphs representing the same \"grapheme\", or orthographic unit, hence, \"Han unification\", with the resulting character repertoire sometimes contracted to Unihan.\n\nUnihan can also refer to the Unihan Database maintained by the Unicode Consortium, which provides information about all of the unified Han characters encoded in the Unicode Standard, including mappings to various national and industry standards, indices into standard dictionaries, encoded variants, pronunciations in various languages, and an English definition. The database is available to the public as text files and via an interactive website.\nThe latter also includes representative glyphs and definitions for compound words drawn from the free Japanese EDICT and Chinese CEDICT dictionary projects (which are provided for convenience and are not a formal part of the Unicode Standard).\n\nThe Unicode Standard details the principles of Han unification.\nThe Ideographic Rapporteur Group (IRG), made up of experts from the Chinese-speaking countries, North and South Korea, Japan, Vietnam, and other countries, is responsible for the process.\n\nOne possible rationale is the desire to limit the size of the full Unicode character set, where CJK characters as represented by discrete ideograms may approach or exceed 100,000 (while those required for ordinary literacy in any language are probably under 3,000). Version 1 of Unicode was designed to fit into 16 bits and only 20,940 characters (32%) out of the possible 65,536 were reserved for these CJK Unified Ideographs. Later Unicode has been extended to 21 bits allowing many more CJK characters (87,887 are assigned, with room for more).\n\nThe article \"The secret life of Unicode\", located on IBM DeveloperWorks attempts to illustrate part of the motivation for Han unification:\n\nIn fact, the three ideographs for \"one\" are encoded separately in Unicode, as they are not considered national variants. The first and second are used on financial instruments to prevent tampering (they may be considered variants), while the third is the common form in all three countries.\n\nHowever, Han unification has also caused considerable controversy, particularly among the Japanese public, who, with the nation's literati, have a history of protesting the culling of historically and culturally significant variants. (See . Today, the list of characters officially recognized for use in proper names continues to expand at a modest pace.)\n\nIn 1993, the Japan Electronic Industries Development Association (JEIDA) published a pamphlet titled \"\" (We are feeling anxious for the future character encoding system ), summarizing major criticism against the Han Unification approach adopted by Unicode.\n\nA grapheme is the smallest abstract unit of meaning in a writing system. Any grapheme has many possible glyph expressions, but all are recognized as the same grapheme by those with reading and writing knowledge of a particular writing system. Although Unicode typically assigns characters to code points to express the graphemes within a system of writing, the Unicode Standard (section 3.4 \"D7\") does with caution:\n\nHowever, this quote refers to the fact that some graphemes are composed of several characters. So, for example, the character\n\nFor a grapheme to be represented by various glyphs means that the grapheme has glyph variations that are usually determined by selecting one font or another or using glyph substitution features where multiple glyphs are included in a single font. Such glyph variations are considered by Unicode a feature of rich text protocols and not properly handled by the plain text goals of Unicode. However, when the change from one glyph to another constitutes a change from one grapheme to another—where a glyph cannot possibly still, for example, mean the same grapheme understood as the small letter \"a\"—Unicode separates those into separate code points. For Unihan the same thing is done whenever the abstract meaning changes, however rather than speaking of the abstract meaning of a grapheme (the letter \"a\"), the unification of Han ideographs assigns a new code point for each different meaning—even if that meaning is expressed by distinct graphemes in different languages. Although a grapheme such as \"ö\" might mean something different in English (as used in the word \"coördinated\") than it does in German, it is still the same grapheme and can be easily unified so that English and German can share a common abstract Latin writing system (along with Latin itself). This example also points to another reason that \"abstract character\" and grapheme as an abstract unit in a written language do not necessarily map one-to-one. In English the combining diaeresis, \"¨\", and the \"o\" it modifies may be seen as two separate graphemes, whereas in languages such as Swedish, the letter \"ö\" may be seen as a single grapheme. Similarly in English the dot on an \"i\" is understood as a part of the \"i\" grapheme whereas in other languages, such as Turkish, the dot may be seen as a separate grapheme added to the dotless \"ı\".\n\nTo deal with the use of different graphemes for the same Unihan sememe, Unicode has relied on several mechanisms: especially as it relates to rendering text. One has been to treat it as simply a font issue so that different fonts might be used to render Chinese, Japanese or Korean. Also font formats such as OpenType allow for the mapping of alternate glyphs according to language so that a text rendering system can look to the user's environmental settings to determine which glyph to use. The problem with these approaches is that they fail to meet the goals of Unicode to define a consistent way of encoding multilingual text.\n\nSo rather than treat the issue as a rich text problem of glyph alternates, Unicode added the concept of variation selectors, first introduced in version 3.2 and supplemented in version 4.0. While variation selectors are treated as combining characters, they have no associated diacritic or mark. Instead, by combining with a base character, they signal the two character sequence selects a variation (typically in terms of grapheme, but also in terms of underlying meaning as in the case of a location name or other proper noun) of the base character. This then is not a selection of an alternate glyph, but the selection of a grapheme variation or a variation of the base abstract character. Such a two-character sequence however can be easily mapped to a separate single glyph in modern fonts. Since Unicode has assigned 256 separate variation selectors, it is capable of assigning 256 variations for any Han ideograph. Such variations can be specific to one language or another and enable the encoding of plain text that includes such grapheme variations.\n\nSince the Unihan standard encodes \"abstract characters\", not \"glyphs\", the graphical artifacts produced by Unicode have been considered temporary technical hurdles, and at most, cosmetic. However, again, particularly in Japan, due in part to the way in which Chinese characters were incorporated into Japanese writing systems historically, the inability to specify a particular variant was considered a significant obstacle to the use of Unicode in scholarly work. For example, the unification of \"grass\" (explained above), means that a historical text cannot be encoded so as to preserve its peculiar orthography. Instead, for example, the scholar would be required to locate the desired glyph in a specific typeface in order to convey the text as written, defeating the purpose of a unified character set. Unicode has responded to these needs by assigning variation selectors so that authors can select grapheme variations of particular ideographs (or even other characters).\n\nSmall differences in graphical representation are also problematic when they affect legibility or belong to the wrong cultural tradition. Besides making some Unicode fonts unusable for texts involving multiple \"Unihan languages\", names or other orthographically sensitive terminology might be displayed incorrectly. (Proper names tend to be especially orthographically conservative—compare this to changing the spelling of one's name to suit a language reform in the US or UK.) While this may be considered primarily a graphical representation or rendering problem to be overcome by more artful fonts, the widespread use of Unicode would make it difficult to preserve such distinctions. The problem of one character representing semantically different concepts is also present in the Latin part of Unicode. The Unicode character for an apostrophe is the same as the character for a right single quote (’). On the other hand, the capital Latin letter \"A\" is not unified with the Greek letter \"Α\" (Alpha). This is, of course, desirable for reasons of compatibility, and deals with a much smaller alphabetic character set.\n\nWhile the unification aspect of Unicode is controversial in some quarters for the reasons given above, Unicode itself does now encode a vast number of seldom-used characters of a more-or-less antiquarian nature.\n\nSome of the controversy stems from the fact that the very decision of performing Han unification was made by the initial Unicode Consortium, which at the time was a consortium of North American companies and organizations (most of them in California), but included no East Asian government representatives. The initial design goal was to create a 16-bit standard, and Han unification was therefore a critical step for avoiding tens of thousands of character duplications. This 16-bit requirement was later abandoned, making the size of the character set less an issue today.\n\nThe controversy later extended to the internationally representative ISO: the initial CJK-JRG group favored a proposal (DIS 10646) for a non-unified character set, \"which was thrown out in favor of unification with the Unicode Consortium's unified character set by the votes of American and European ISO members\" (even though the Japanese position was unclear). Endorsing the Unicode Han unification was a necessary step for the heated ISO 10646/Unicode merger.\n\nMuch of the controversy surrounding Han unification is based on the distinction between glyphs, as defined in Unicode, and the related but distinct idea of graphemes. Unicode assigns abstract characters (graphemes), as opposed to glyphs, which are a particular visual representations of a character in a specific typeface. One character may be represented by many distinct glyphs, for example a \"g\" or an \"a\", both of which may have one loop (\"a\", g) or two (a, g). Yet for a reader of Latin script based languages the two variations of the \"a\" character are both recognized as the same grapheme. Graphemes present in national character code standards have been added to Unicode, as required by Unicode's Source Separation rule, even where they can be composed of characters already available. The national character code standards existing in CJK languages are considerably more involved, given the technological limitations under which they evolved, and so the official CJK participants in Han unification may well have been amenable to reform.\n\nUnlike European versions, CJK Unicode fonts, due to Han unification, have large but irregular patterns of overlap, requiring language-specific fonts. Unfortunately, language-specific fonts also make it difficult to access a variant which, as with the \"grass\" example, happens to appear more typically in another language style. (That is to say, it would be difficult to access \"grass\" with the four-stroke radical more typical of Traditional Chinese in a Japanese environment, which fonts would typically depict the three-stroke radical.) Unihan proponents tend to favor markup languages for defining language strings, but this would not ensure the use of a specific variant in the case given, only the language-specific font more likely to depict a character as that variant. (At this point, merely stylistic differences do enter in, as a selection of Japanese and Chinese fonts are not likely to be visually compatible.)\n\nChinese users seem to have fewer objections to Han unification, largely because Unicode did not attempt to unify Simplified Chinese characters with Traditional Chinese characters. (Simplified Chinese characters are an invention of the People's Republic of China and they are used among Chinese speakers in the PRC, Singapore, and Malaysia. Traditional Chinese characters are used in Hong Kong and Taiwan (Big5) and they are, with some differences, more familiar to Korean and Japanese users.) Unicode is seen as neutral with regards to this politically charged issue, and has encoded Simplified and Traditional Chinese glyphs separately (e.g. the ideograph for \"discard\" is 丟 U+4E1F for Traditional Chinese Big5 #A5E1 and 丢 U+4E22 for Simplified Chinese GB #2210). It is also noted that Traditional and Simplified characters should be encoded separately according to Unicode Han Unification rules, because they are distinguished in pre-existing PRC character sets. Furthermore, as with other variants, Traditional to Simplified characters is not a one-to-one relationship.\n\nThere are several alternative character sets that are not encoding according to the principle of Han Unification, and thus free from its restrictions:\nThese region-dependent character sets are also seen as not affected by Han Unification because of their region-specific nature:\nHowever, none of these alternative standards has been as widely adopted as Unicode, which is now the base character set for many new standards and protocols, internationally adopted, and is built into the architecture of operating systems (Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS, and many Unix-like systems), programming languages (Perl, Python, C#, Java, Common Lisp, APL, C, C++), and libraries (IBM International Components for Unicode (ICU) along with the Pango, Graphite, Scribe, Uniscribe, and ATSUI rendering engines), font formats (TrueType and OpenType) and so on.\n\nIn March 1989, a (B)TRON-based system was adopted by Japanese government organizations \"Center for Educational Computing\" as the system of choice for school education including compulsory education. However, in April, a report titled \"1989 National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers\" from Office of the United States Trade Representative have specifically listed the system as a trade barrier in Japan. The report claimed that the adoption of the TRON-based system by the Japanese government is advantageous to Japanese manufacturers, and thus excluding US operating systems from the huge new market; specifically the report lists MS-DOS, OS/2 and UNIX as examples. The Office of USTR was allegedly under Microsoft's influence as its former officer Tom Robertson was then offered a lucrative position by Microsoft. While the TRON system itself was subsequently removed from the list of sanction by Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 after protests by the organization in May 1989, the trade dispute caused the Ministry of International Trade and Industry to accept a request from Masayoshi Son to cancel the Center of Educational Computing's selection of the TRON-based system for the use of educational computers. The incident is regarded as a symbolic event for the loss of momentum and eventual demise of the BTRON system, which led to the widespread adoption of MS-DOS in Japan and the eventual adoption of Unicode with its successor Windows.\n\nThere has not been any push for full semantic unification of all semantically-linked characters, though the idea would treat the respective users of East Asian languages the same, whether they write in Korean, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Kyūjitai Japanese, Shinjitai Japanese or Vietnamese. Instead of some variants getting unique code points while other groups of variants have to share single code points, all variants could be reliably expressed only with metadata tags (e.g., CSS formatting in webpages). The burden would be on all those who use differing versions of 直, 別, 兩, 兔, whether that difference be due to simplification, international variance or intra-national variance. However, for some platforms (e.g., smartphones), a device may come with only one font pre-installed. The system font must make a decision for the default glyph for each code point and these glyphs can differ greatly, indicating different underlying graphemes.\n\nConsequently, relying on language markup across the board as an approach is beset with two major issues. First, there are contexts where language markup is not available (code commits, plain text). Second, any solution would require every operating system to come pre-installed with many glyphs for semantically identical characters that have many variants. In addition to the standard character sets in Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Kyūjitai Japanese and Shinjitai Japanese, there also exist \"ancient\" forms of characters that are of interest to historians, linguists and philologists.\n\nUnicode's Unihan database has already drawn connections between many characters. The Unicode database catalogs the connections between variant characters with unique code points already. However, for characters with a shared code point, the reference glyph image is usually biased toward the Traditional Chinese version. Also, the decision of whether to classify pairs as semantic variants or z-variants is not always consistent or clear, despite rationalizations in the handbook.\n\nSo-called semantic variants of 丟 (U+4E1F) and 丢 (U+4E22) are examples that Unicode gives as differing in a significant way in their abstract shapes, while Unicode lists 佛 and 仏 as z-variants, differing only in font styling. Paradoxically, Unicode considers 兩 and 両 to be near identical z-variants while at the same time classifying them as significantly different semantic variants. There are also cases of some pairs of characters being simultaneously semantic variants and specialized semantic variants and simplified variants: 個 (U+500B) and 个 (U+4E2A). There are cases of non-mutual equivalence. For example, the Unihan database entry for 亀 (U+4E80) considers 龜 (U+9F9C) to be its z-variant, but the entry for 龜 does not list 亀 as a z-variant, even though 龜 was obviously already in the database at the time that the entry for 亀 was written.\n\nSome clerical errors led to doubling of completely identical characters such as 﨣 (U+FA23) and 𧺯 (U+27EAF). If a font has glyphs encoded to both points so that one font is used for both, they should appear identical. These cases are listed as z-variants despite having no variance at all. Intentionally duplicated characters were added to facilitate bit-for-bit round-trip conversion. Because round-trip conversion was an early selling point of Unicode, this meant that if a national standard in use unnecessarily duplicated a character, Unicode had to do the same. Unicode calls these intentional duplications \"compatibility variants\" as with 漢 (U+FA9A) which calls 漢 (U+6F22) its compatibility variant. As long as an application uses the same font for both, they should appear identical. Sometimes, as in the case of 車 with U+8ECA and U+F902, the added compatibility character lists the already present version of 車 as both its compatibility variant and its z-variant. The compatibility variant field overrides the z-variant field, forcing normalization under all forms, including canonical equivalence. Despite the name, compatibility variants are actually canonically equivalent and are united in any Unicode normalization scheme and not only under compatibility normalization. This is similar to how is canonically equivalent to a pre-composed . Much software (such as the MediaWiki software that hosts Wikipedia) will replace all canonically equivalent characters that are discouraged (e.g. the angstrom symbol) with the recommended equivalent. Despite the name, CJK \"compatibility variants\" are canonically equivalent characters and not compatibility characters.\n\n漢 (U+FA9A) was added to the database later than 漢 (U+6F22) was and its entry informs the user of the compatibility information. On the other hand, 漢 (U+6F22) does not have this equivalence listed in this entry. Unicode demands that all entries, once admitted, cannot change compatibility or equivalence so that normalization rules for already existing characters do not change.\n\nSome pairs of Traditional and Simplified are also considered to be semantic variants. According to Unicode's definitions, it makes sense that all simplifications (that do not result in wholly different characters being merged for their homophony) will be a form of semantic variant. Unicode classifies 丟 and 丢 as each other's respective traditional and simplified variants and also as each other's semantic variants. However, while Unicode classifies 億 (U+5104) and 亿 (U+4EBF) as each other's respective traditional and simplified variants, Unicode does not consider 億 and 亿 to be semantic variants of each other.\n\nUnicode claims that \"Ideally, there would be no pairs of z-variants in the Unicode Standard.\" This would make it seem that the goal is to at least unify all minor variants, compatibility redundancies and accidental redundancies, leaving the differentiation to fonts and to language tags. This conflicts with the stated goal of Unicode to take away that overhead, and to allow any number of any of the world's scripts to be on the same document with one encoding system. Chapter One of the handbook states that \"With Unicode, the information technology industry has replaced proliferating character sets with data stability, global interoperability and data interchange, simplified software, and reduced development costs. While taking the ASCII character set as its starting point, the Unicode Standard goes far beyond ASCII's limited ability to encode only the upper- and lowercase letters A through Z. It provides the capacity to encode all characters used for the written languages of the world – more than 1 million characters can be encoded. No escape sequence or control code is required to specify any character in any language. The Unicode character encoding treats alphabetic characters, ideographic characters, and symbols equivalently, which means they can be used in any mixture and with equal facility.\"\n\nThat leaves us with settling on one unified reference grapheme for all z-variants, which is contentious since few outside of Japan would recognize 佛 and 仏 as equivalent. Even within Japan, the variants are on different sides of a major simplification called Shinjitai. Unicode would effectively make the PRC's simplification of 侣 (U+4FA3) and 侶 (U+4FB6) a monumental difference by comparison. Such a plan would also eliminate the very visually distinct variations for characters like 直 (U+76F4) and 雇 (U+96C7).\n\nOne would expect that all simplified characters would simultaneously also be z-variants or semantic variants with their traditional counterparts, but many are neither. It is easier to explain the strange case that semantic variants can be simultaneously both semantic variants and specialized variants when Unicode's definition is that specialized semantic variants have the same meaning only in certain contexts. Languages use them differently. A pair whose characters are 100% drop-in replacements for each other in Japanese may not be so flexible in Chinese. Thus, any comprehensive merger of recommended code points would have to maintain some variants that differ only slightly in appearance even if the meaning is 100% the same for all contexts in one language, because in another language the two characters may not be 100% drop-in replacements.\n\nIn each row of the following table, the same character is repeated in all five columns. However, each column is marked (by the lang attribute) as being in a different language: Chinese (two varieties: simplified and traditional), Japanese, Korean, or Vietnamese. The browser should select, for each character, a glyph (from a font) suitable to the specified language. (Besides actual character variation—look for differences in stroke order, number, or direction—the typefaces may also reflect different typographical styles, as with serif and non-serif alphabets.) This only works for fallback glyph selection if you have CJK fonts installed on your system and the font selected to display this article does not include glyphs for these characters.\n\nNo character variant that is exclusive to Korean or Vietnamese has received a unique code point, whereas almost all Shinjitai Japanese variants or Simplified Chinese variants each have unique code points and unambiguous reference glyphs in the Unicode standard.\n\nIn the twentieth century, East Asian countries made their own respective encoding standards. Within each standard, there coexisted variants with unique code points, hence the unique code points in Unicode for certain sets of variants. Taking Simplified Chinese as an example, the two character variants of 內 (U+5167) and 内 (U+5185) differ in exactly the same way as do the Korean and non-Korean variants of 全 (U+5168). Each respective variant of the first character has either 入 (U+5165) or 人 (U+4EBA). Each respective variant of the second character has either 入 (U+5165) or 人 (U+4EBA). Both variants of the first character got their own unique code points. However, the two variants of the second character had to share the same code point.\n\nThe justification Unicode gives is that the national standards body in the PRC made unique code points for the two variations of the first character 內/内, whereas Korea never made separate code points for the unique variants of 全. There is a reason for this that has nothing to do with how the domestic bodies view the characters themselves. China went through a process in the twentieth century that changed (if not simplified) several characters. During this transition, there was a need to be able encode both variants within the same document. Korean has always used the variant of with the 入 (U+5165) radical on top. Therefore, it had no reason to encode both variants. Korean language documents made in the twentieth century had little reason to represent both versions in the same document.\n\nAlmost all of the variants that the PRC developed or standardized got unique code points owing simply to the fortune of the Simplified Chinese transition carrying through into the computing age. This privilege however, seems to apply inconsistently, whereas most simplifications performed in Japan and mainland China with code points in national standards, including characters simplified differently in each country, did make it into Unicode as unique code points.\n\n62 Shinjitai \"simplified\" characters with unique code points in Japan got merged with their Kyūjitai traditional equivalents, like 海. This can cause problems for the language tagging strategy. There is no universal tag for the traditional and \"simplified\" versions of Japanese as there are for Chinese. Thus, any Japanese writer wanting to display the Kyūjitai form of 海 may have to tag the character as \"Traditional Chinese\" or trust that the recipient's Japanese font uses only the Kyūjitai glyphs, but tags of Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese may be necessary to show the two forms side-by-side in a Japanese textbook. This would preclude one from using the same font for an entire document, however. There are two unique code points for 海 in Unicode, but only for \"compatibility reasons\". Any Unicode-conformant font must display the Kyūjitai and Shinjitai versions' equivalent code points in Unicode as the same. Unofficially, a font may display 海 differently with U+6D77 as the Shinjitai version and U+FA45 as the Kyūjitai version (which is identical to the traditional version in written Chinese and Korean).\n\nThe radical 糸 (U+7CF8) is used in characters like 紅/红, with two variants, the second form being simply the cursive form. The radical components of 紅 (U+7D05) and 红 (U+7EA2) are semantically identical and the glyphs differ only in the latter using a cursive version of the 糸 component. However, in mainland China, the standards bodies wanted to standardize the cursive form when used in characters like 红. Because this change happened relatively recently, there was a transition period. Both 紅 (U+7D05) and 红 (U+7EA2) got separate code points in the PRC's text encoding standards bodies so Chinese-language documents could use both version. The two variants each received unique code points in Unicode as well.\n\nThe case of the radical 艸 (U+8278) proves how arbitrary the state of affairs is. When used to compose characters like 草 (U+8349), the radical was placed at the top, but had two different forms. Traditional Chinese and Korean use a four-stroke version. At the top of should be something that looks like two plus signs (). Simplified Chinese, Kyūjitai Japanese and Shinjitai Japanese use a three-stroke version, like two plus signs sharing their horizontal strokes (, i.e. ). The PRC's text encoding bodies did not encode the two variants differently. The fact that almost every other change brought about by the PRC, no matter how minor, did warrant a unique code point suggests that this exception may have been unintentional. Unicode copied the existing standards as is, preserving such irregularities.\n\nThe Unicode Consortium has recognized errors in other instances. The myriad Unicode blocks for CJK Han Ideographs have redundancies in original standards, redundancies brought about by flawed importation of the original standards, as well as accidental mergers that are later corrected, providing precedent for dis-unifying characters.\n\nFor native speakers, variants can be unintelligible or be unacceptable in educated contexts. English speakers may understand a handwritten note saying \"4P5 kg\" as \"495 kg\", but writing the nine backwards (so it looks like a \"P\") can be jarring and would be considered incorrect in any school. Likewise, to users of one CJK language reading a document with \"foreign\" glyphs: variants of 骨 can appear as mirror images, 者 can be missing a stroke/have an extraneous stroke, and 令 may be unreadable or be confused with 今 depending on which variant of 令 is used.\n\nFor more striking variants, Unicode has encoded variant characters, making it unnecessary to switch between fonts or lang attributes. In the following table, each row compares variants that have been assigned different code points. Note that for characters such as 入 (U+5165), the only way to display the two variants is to change font (or lang attribute) as described in the previous table. However, for 內 (U+5167), there is an alternate character 内 (U+5185) as illustrated below. For some characters, like 兌/兑 (U+514C/U+5151), either method can be used to display the different glyphs.\n\nIn order to resolve issues brought by Han unification, a Unicode Technical Standard known as the Unicode Ideographic Variation Database have been created to resolve the problem of specifying specific glyph in plain text environment.. By registering glyph collections into the Ideographic Variation Database (IVD), it is possible to use Ideographic Variation Selectors to form Ideographic Variation Sequence (IVS) to specify or restrict the appopriate glyph in text processing in a Unicode environment.\n\nIdeographic characters assigned by Unicode appear in the following blocks:\n\n\nUnicode includes support of CJKV radicals, strokes, punctuation, marks and symbols in the following blocks:\n\nAdditional compatibility (discouraged use) characters appear in these blocks:\nThese compatibility characters (excluding the twelve unified ideographs in the CJK Compatibility Ideographs block) are included for compatibility with legacy text handling systems and other legacy character sets. They include forms of characters for vertical text layout and rich text characters that Unicode recommends handling through other means.\n\nThe International Ideographs Core (IICore) is a subset of 9810 ideographs derived from the CJK Unified Ideographs tables, designed to be implemented in devices with limited memory, input/output capability, and/or applications where the use of the complete ISO 10646 ideograph repertoire is not feasible. There are 9810 characters in the current standard.\n\nThe Unihan project has always made an effort to make available their build database.\n\nThe libUnihan project provides a normalized SQLite Unihan database and corresponding C library.

{"id": "17185239", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17185239", "title": "Joint attention", "text": "Joint attention\n\nJoint attention or shared attention is the shared focus of two individuals on an object. It is achieved when one individual alerts another to an object by means of eye-gazing, pointing or other verbal or non-verbal indications. An individual gazes at another individual, points to an object and then returns their gaze to the individual. Scaife and Bruner were the first researchers to present a cross-sectional description of children's ability to follow eye gaze in 1975. They found that most eight- to ten-month-old children followed a line of regard, and that all 11- to 14-month-old children did so. This early research showed it was possible for an adult to bring certain objects in the environment to an infant's attention using eye gaze.\n\nSubsequent research demonstrates that two important skills in joint attention are following eye gaze and identifying intention. The ability to share gaze with another individual is an important skill in establishing reference. The ability to identify intention is important in a child's ability to learn language and direct the attention of others. Joint attention is important for many aspects of language development including comprehension, production and word learning. Episodes of joint attention provide children with information about their environment, allowing individuals to establish reference from spoken language and learn words. Socio-emotional development and the ability to take part in normal relationships are also influenced by joint attention abilities. The ability to establish joint attention may be negatively affected by deafness, blindness, and developmental disorders such as autism.\n\nOther animals such as great apes, orangutans, chimpanzees, dogs, and horses also show some elements of joint attention.\n\nDefining levels of joint attention is important in determining if children are engaging in age-appropriate joint attention. There are three levels of joint attention: triadic, dyadic, and shared gaze.\n\nTriadic joint attention is the highest level of joint attention and involves two individuals looking at an object. Each individual must understand that the other individual is looking at the same object and realize that there is an element of shared attention. For an instance of social engagement to count as triadic joint attention it requires at least two individuals attending to an object or focusing their attention on each other. Additionally, the individual must display awareness that focus is shared between himself or herself and another individual. Triadic attention is marked by the individual looking back to the other individual after looking at the object.\n\nDyadic joint attention is a conversation-like behavior that individuals engage in. This is especially true for human adults and infants, who engage in this behavior starting at two months of age. Adults and infants take turns exchanging facial expressions, noises, and in the case of the adult, speech.\n\nShared gaze occurs when two individuals are simply looking at an object. Shared gaze is the lowest level of joint attention.\n\nIndividuals who engage in triadic joint attention must understand both gaze and intention to establish common reference. Gaze refers to a child's understanding of the link between mental activity and the physical act of seeing. Intention refers to the child's ability to understand the goal of another person's mental processes.\n\nFor an individual to engage in joint attention they must establish reference. Following the gaze or directive actions (such as pointing) of others is a common way of establishing reference. For an individual to understand that following gaze establishes reference the individual must display:\n\nGaze becomes more complex with age and practice. As gaze increases in complexity, individuals are better able to discriminate what others are referring to. Joint attention is also important for social learning. Gaze following reflects an expectation-based type of orienting in which an individual's attention is cued by another's head turn or eye turn. Individuals are motivated to follow another's gaze and engage in joint attention because gaze is a cue for which rewarding events occur.\n\nThe ability to identify intention is critical to joint attention. When individuals understand that others have goals, intentions, and attentional states, they are able to enter into and direct another's attention. Joint attention promotes and maintains dyadic exchanges and learning about the nature of social partners. The ability to engage in joint attention is crucial for language development.\n\nIndividuals who are intentional in their actions display regularity in their behavior. Individuals locate objects with their eyes, move towards the object, and then use hands to make contact with and manipulate the object. Change in gaze direction is one of several behavioral cues that individuals use in combination with changes in facial and vocal displays and body posture to mark the intention to act on an object. Individuals who seek or follow a joint focus of attention display knowledge that what is in their awareness is also in another's awareness. They believe that they are experiencing the same world as others.\n\nJoint attention plays an important role in the development of theory of mind. Theory of mind and joint attention are important precursors to a fully developed grasp of another individual's mental activity.\n\nThe ability of children to extract information from their environment rests on understandings of attentional behaviors such as pointing. Episodes of joint attention provide children with a great deal of information about objects by establishing reference and intention. Joint attention occurs within particular environments. The items and events in that environment provide a context that enables the child to associate meaning with a particular utterance. Joint attention makes relevant aspects of the context salient, helping children comprehend what is taking place.\n\nAn infant's social environment relates to his or her later language development. Children's first words are closely linked to their early language experience. For children with typically developing language skills, there is a close match between maternal speech and their environment: up to 78% of maternal speech is matched to the object the child is focusing on. In children with delayed language development, only 50% of maternal speech is matched to the object the infant is focusing on. Infants are more likely to engage in joint attention when the parent talks about an object that the child is attending to as opposed to an object outside of the infant's attention. This increased level of joint attention aids in encouraging normal language development, including word comprehension and production. When joint attention is present, it plays an important role in word learning, a crucial aspect of language development.\n\nJoint attention and the ability to attend to an aspect of one's environment are fundamental to normal relationships that rely on the sharing of experience and knowledge. Infants are highly motivated to share experience. An infant's motivation to engage in joint attention is strong enough that infants voluntarily turn away from interesting sights to engage in joint attention with others.\n\nAs described in attachment theory, infants need to develop a relationship with a primary caregiver to achieve normal social and emotional development. A key part of the ability to develop this relationship may be joint attention. In addition to language development, joint attention serves the function of preparing infants for more complex social structures involved in adult conversation. Children's skills in initiating and responding to joint attention predict their social competence at 30 months of age. Anticipatory smiling (a low level form of joint attention involving smiling at an object then turning the smile to one's communicative partner) at 9 months positively predicts parent-rated social competence scores at 30 months in infants. Early joint attention abilities account for differences in social and emotional abilities in later life.\n\nAt the age of 2 months, children engage in dyadic joint attention and conversation-like exchanges with adults during which each is the focus of the other's attention and they take turns exchanging looks, noises and mouth movements. At age 3 months, children display joint attention skills by calling to a caregiver when they are not perceivable. When caregiver does not respond in a similar manner, child exhibits a series of responses that were first studied in early 1970s by Edward Tronick in collaboration with pediatrician T. Berry Brazelton at the time when the latter was creating the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale. At age 6 months, infants display joint attentional skills by:\n\nAt age 8 months, infants demonstrate joint attention through proto-declarative pointing, particularly in girls. At 9 months of age, infants begin to display triadic joint attention. Infants also will display joint attention activities, such as communicative gestures, social referencing, and using the behavior of others to guide response to novel things.\n\nAt one year of age, joint attention is displayed through a child's understanding of pointing as an intentional act. One-year-olds also establish joint attention for objects within their visual field before objects beyond their current visual field. At this age, infants are not yet able to represent their entire environment, only what they can see. At age 15 months, children recognize the minds of others. At this age, children also recognize the importance of eyes for seeing and that physical objects can block sight. At age 18 months, infants are capable of following an individual's gaze to outside their visual field and establishing (representative) joint attention. 18-month-olds also grasp the intentional, referential nature of looking, the mentalistic experience of seeing and the role of eyes and are skilled at following both gaze and pointing with precision. At two years of age, children display joint attention by extending attention beyond the present and understanding that the targets of other's attention extends to the past as well. Two-year-olds are also capable of representational thought or increased memory.\n\nSeveral studies have shown that problems with joint attention are associated with developmental processes. Difficulties in establishing joint attention may partially account for differences in social abilities of children with developmental disorders (i.e. Autism spectrum disorders). A core deficit noted in autism is eye gaze. Autistic children have difficulty alternating their attention towards a partner and third object. This difficulty is attributed to their deficiencies in following gaze, resulting in difficulty initiating and maintaining joint attention. Deaf infants are able to engage in joint attention similar to hearing infants; however, the time spent engaged in joint attention is often reduced in deaf infants born to hearing parents. Hearing parents of deaf infants often are less likely to respond and expand on their deaf infants' initiative and communicative acts. Deaf infants of deaf parents do not show reduced time spent in joint attention. Auditory input is not critical to joint attention but similar modes of communication and understanding are vital. Furthermore, mothers who are unable to successfully establish regular joint attention with their child rate that infant lower on scales of social competence. Judgement of low social competence can be made as early as 18 months of age. In blind infants, joint attention is established by means of auditory input or feeling another person's hand on an object and may be delayed compared to sighted infants.\n\nTriadic joint attention is the highest level of joint attention and involves two individuals looking at an object. Each individual must understand that the other individual is looking at the same object and realize that there is an element of shared attention. Triadic attention is marked by the individual looking back to the other individual after looking at the object. Dyadic joint attention involves mutual gaze between the parent and infant. Mutual gaze is marked by both the parent and infant looking at each other's face. If two individuals are simply looking at an object, it is referred to as shared gaze.\n\nInfant and parent chimpanzees show dyadic joint attention in an affectionate manner by looking at each other's eyes Non-human animals such as Japanese monkeys, baboons, and other Old World monkeys seldom engage in dyadic joint attention. For these animals, the eye contact involved in dyadic joint attention is deemed threatening.\n\nGaze following, or shared gaze, can be found in a number of primates. Domesticated animals such as dogs and horses also demonstrate shared gaze. This type of joint attention is important for animals because gaze shifts serve as indicators alerting the animal to the location of predators, mates, or food.\n\nChimpanzees are capable of actively locating objects that are the focus of another individual's attention by tracking the gaze of others. They are not limited to following eye gaze to the first interesting object in their view. They use a number of different cues to engage in shared focus, including head movement and eye gaze. Infant chimpanzees start to follow tap, point, and head turn cues of an experimenter by nine months of age. By 13 months of age, they show following responses to glance cues without a head turn. There is no evidence to support that infant chimpanzees are able to use eye gaze alone as a cue for following responses. By 20 months of age, infant chimpanzees are able to follow an experimenter's cues to a target behind the chimpanzee but infant chimpanzees do not look back to the experimenter after looking at the target. Moving targets are more salient than stationary targets for infant chimpanzees. Chimpanzee infants are sensitive to faces which are gazing at them, but chimpanzees less than three to four years old only look within their visual field when using the experimenter's head turn as their cue.\n\n"}

They are now primarily made in Cairo, Egypt, along a covered market known as the Street of the Tentmakers (Share'a el Khayamiya, or Souq El-Khaymiya). This street is located immediately south of Bab Zuweila, and has been in continuous use since the Mamluk era.\n\nKhayamiya are elaborately patterned and colourful appliques applied to the interior of tents, serving a dual function of shelter and ornament. They resemble quilts, and possess the three layers typical of quilts - a heavy 'back', a background 'top', and elaborate applique over the 'top'. Functionally, they can be compared to curtains, though their recent roles have diversified to cater for touristic purposes. These now include cushion covers, fashion, bags, bedspreads, and other applications.\n\nKhayamiya feature hand-stitched cotton appliqué over a heavy cotton back. This back is intended to be protective and durable against a hot, dry, and dusty climate. The hand-stitching is performed quickly by skilled tentmakers while seated cross-legged, using needles and thread. Small pieces of fabric are cut to size as they are required using large scissors. Khayamiya are usually completed by a single tentmaker regardless of the size of the piece. These can range from basic cushion covers to intricate whole-wall hangings several metres across. Large projects can subsequently take several months to complete. The tentmakers are very protective of their creative innovations, as successful new designs are often copied by their competitive neighbours.\n\nPopular design motifs include geometric and curvilinear arabesque patterns derived from Islamic ornaments, and scenes inspired by Pharaonic art, especially papyrus and lotus motifs. Egyptian folkloric subjects such as Goha, Nubian musicians, and the whirling dervishes are popular touristic souvenirs, as are stylised depictions of fish and birds. Calligraphic patterns, based upon texts from the Qur’an, are often shaped into objects and animals. Khedival panels made in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century typically feature larger blocks of appliqué and wider stitching, though touristic and contemporary khayamiya feature finer and more elaborate handwork.\n\nThe correct spelling is in Arabic, but English approximations of this term are diverse, including Khiamiah, Khiyamiya, Khiamiyya, Khyamiyya, Kheyyemiah, Kheyameya, and Khayyāmia. The Arabic word \"Khayma\" (خيمة), meaning 'tent', is also linked to the Persian خیام Khayyām (which also means 'Tentmaker'). Popular alternative descriptions in English include the 'work of the Tentmakers of Cairo', 'Tentmaker applique' or simply 'Egyptian applique'. Medhat Adel Emam has discussed the origin of the term as it applies to distinctly Egyptian Arabic with Turkish influences. Very large decorated 'pavilions' in Khayamiya are known as \"suradeq\".\n\nHistoric specimens of khayamiya are rare. They were originally made to be placed outside in dry heat and dust, and were regarded as replaceable - hence not highly valued for collection or preservation. Khedival examples are held in the collection of several museums, including the British Museum. There are also references to Khayamiya in photographic records and European orientalist paintings from the nineteenth century and earlier. Literary references to their use, including illustrations, can be seen in medieval manuscripts. There is archaeological evidence to suggest that textiles comparable to khayamiya have been created and used in Egypt since the Pharaonic era.\n\nDespite their historic legacy, the 'tentmaker' occupation is now endangered. This is largely due to competition from imported mass-printed fabrics bearing similar decorative patterns. These printed sheets are now widely used across Egypt as temporary screens for special events, notably during Ramadan, festivals, weddings, and funerals, in place of the original handmade Khayamiya. The majority of Khayamiya created in recent years are marketed to tourists visiting Egypt. In the 2000s, the first international exhibitions of Egyptian khayamiya were held in Australia, the UK, France, and the USA. These were curated by Jenny Bowker, an Australian quiltmaker and teacher.\n\nThe Egyptian artist Moataz Nasr features Khayamiya-inspired aspects in his contemporary mixed-media artwork.\nSusan Hefuna's installation \"I Love Egypt!\" (featured in the 18th Biennale of Sydney in 2012) also applies Khayamiya within the context of contemporary installation art. From 2009, the Egyptian artist Hani el-Masri collaborated with the Tentmakers to produce a 5m x 8m interpretation of the One Thousand and One Nights. The Algerian artist Rachid Koraïchi has also collaborated with the Tentmakers of Cairo to create large calligraphic banners, such as his Invisible Masters series. As Koraïchi stated in 2011:\n\nThis link will direct you to a Google Map detailing the location of the Street of the Tentmakers, relative to the popular tourist landmarks of the Khan el-Khalili. The Tentmaker's Street is not known for the hard-sell hassles associated with touristic shopping in the Khan el-Khalili.\n\nThere are four main forms of Khayamiya - Khedival, Touristic, Street, and Contemporary.\n\n\nContemporary khaymiya can be divided into the following sub-genres:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "689980", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=689980", "title": "Mercury Rising", "text": "Mercury Rising\n\nMercury Rising is a 1998 American political action thriller film starring Bruce Willis and Alec Baldwin. Directed by Harold Becker, the movie is based on Ryne Douglas Pearson's 1996 novel originally published as \"Simple Simon\". Willis plays Art Jeffries, an undercover FBI agent who protects a 9-year-old autistic boy who is targeted by government assassins after he cracks a top secret government code.\n\nThe film was released on April 3, 1998. It received mostly negative reviews.\n\nA cryptographic code called \"Mercury\" was created by the National Security Agency and is allegedly so complex that its creators believe no computer on Earth can decipher it. Originally it was created during the Reagan Administration as a test to keep the United States' highest priority secrets under wraps. One day, the NSA receives a message from a nine-year-old autistic savant with prodigious math abilities named Simon Lynch (Miko Hughes), who calls a telephone number written in the code which was secretly published in a puzzle magazine by two of the creators, Dean Crandell (Robert Stanton) and Leo Pedranski (Bodhi Elfman), to see if anyone could break it. Crandell and Pedranski's division chief, Lt. Colonel Nicholas Kudrow (Alec Baldwin) sees the boy's ability to decipher the code as a grave liability. He dispatches assassin Peter Burrell (Lindsey Lee Ginter) to murder the boy and his parents, Martin (John Carroll Lynch) and Jenny (Kelley Hazen).\n\nAfter shooting Martin and Jenny, Burrell searches the house, fails to find Simon, and leaves at the sound of approaching sirens (Martin was able to call 911 before dying). FBI Agent Art Jeffries (Bruce Willis), demoted following a diagnosis of delusional paranoia after blaming himself for the death of a teenager in a hostage situation gone wrong, is sent to investigate what is initially thought to be a murder-suicide. While investigating the scene, Jeffries finds Simon hiding in a cache of his bedroom closet and takes the boy under his wing. Jeffries begins to realize the difficulty of protecting, let alone questioning, Simon because of his impaired social abilities as a result of his autism, but the Chicago Police Department agree to assign a protection detail to Simon. Burrell tries to kill Simon again at the hospital, but Jeffries stops him. He is then forced to terminate an assassin named Shayes (Peter Stormare) on the Chicago 'L' train. The situation is further complicated by the fact that nobody at the FBI believes Simon is in any danger, and Jeffries is soon framed by the NSA as a kidnapper, with only his best friend and fellow agent Tommy Jordan (Chi McBride) aware that he did not commit the crime, since Jordan had been in contact with Jeffries when the incident began. Jeffries borrows Jordan's car (which Jordan later reports stolen to conceal his involvement) and takes Simon back to his house. Simon again calls the telephone number written in the code and talks to Crandell and Pedranski. When Jeffries confronts them, a conflicted Crandell arranges a meeting via encoded e-mail at the Wrigley Building. The next morning, Jeffries meets a woman named Stacey Siebring (Kim Dickens) in a coffee shop and asks her to watch Simon for him.\n\nJeffries meets Crandell and the two talk and stroll on a busy sidewalk. Crandell tells Jeffries about \"Mercury\" and Kudrow, then Burrell shoots him from behind and gets away safely. Jeffries returns to the coffee shop, but Simon and Stacey are gone. He goes outside and spots them coming across the street. Stacey says she and Simon have become friends and Simon agrees. Jeffries and Simon then abruptly leave Stacey. Later in the middle of the night, Jeffries and Simon go to Stacey's house, asking for a place to stay. Stacey reluctantly agrees and tells Jeffries that she was going on a business trip to Des Moines to make the rent the next morning.\n\nMeanwhile, Pedranski, having learned Crandell's fate, picks up where his friend left off by writing a pair of letters via typewriter: one to Jeffries and the other to the Senate Oversight Committee, revealing Kudrow's unlawful actions. Soon after, Pedranski is murdered by Burrell, who also snatches the letters. However, the assassin neglects to grab the carbon copies Pedranski tossed, which his girlfriend, NSA analyst Emily Lang (Carrie Preston), takes to the FBI. Jordan discreetly arranges for her to meet with Jeffries to show them both the carbon paper used to type the letter, which, being covered in Pedranski's fingerprints, is crucial evidence in its own right. After the meeting with Emily, Jeffries tells Stacey to call anyone for an emergency except the police, who were called off at the last minute, and gives her Jordan's number in case of an emergency. While Jeffries introduces himself to Kudrow at his birthday party and demands that Kudrow leave Simon alone, Jordan, under Jeffries' suggestion, arranges for Simon to go into Witness Protection. After the meeting, Jeffries calls Jordan, who explains that the Witness Protection meeting is going to happen, though they are unaware that their conversation is being monitored by Kudrow. When Jeffries returns and finds Stacey and Simon gone, he learns from Jordan that they are not in any danger and will meet them there, just as Jordan is given an order to head to the FBI director's office.\n\nKudrow tries to have FBI SAC (Special Agent in Charge) Joe Lomax (Kevin Conway) help turn the tables on Jeffries by using his authority and the fact that Jordan arranged the Witness Protection under false pretenses. He plans to have the NSA take over the protection for the meeting location. After Kudrow leaves, Jordan shows the evidence to Lomax and despite his initial doubts, Jordan confirms that the fingerprint markings on it were Pedranski's, now fully validating the evidence against Kudrow. Jeffries, with Jordan and a small FBI task force's help, sets a trap at the meeting spot. During the battle, Jordan protects Stacey, and the FBI team takes on Burrell, who is killed, trying to escape, when the windows blow out slashing his face open. Jeffries and Kudrow fight on the roof during which Simon walks to the edge of the roof and grabs Kudrow's gun, giving it to Jeffries and allowing him to take control as Jordan and the team come in. In a last-ditch effort to get his victim back, Kudrow grabs Simon, is shot at point blank range by Jeffries, and subsequently falls to his death over the edge of the building.\n\nJeffries later visits Simon (now living with foster parents) at his school. He embraces the FBI agent as a welcome friend, having finally accepted him as a person he trusts.\n\n\nBruce Willis received the 1999 Golden Raspberry Award as Worst Actor for his performance (as well as for \"Armageddon\" and \"The Siege\"). \nMiko Hughes won the category of \"Best Performance in a Feature Film—Leading Young Actor\" at the 1999 Young Artist Awards for his portrayal of Simon.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film has a score of 17% based on reviews from 35 critics with an average rating of 4.2/10. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four, writing: \"\"Mercury Rising\" is about the most sophisticated cryptographic system known to man, and about characters considerably denser than anyone in the audience. Sitting in the dark, our minds idly playing with the plot, we figure out what they should do, how they should do it, and why they should do it, while the characters on the screen strain helplessly against the requirements of the formula.\" James Berardinelli rated it one and a half out of four stars, saying: \"The script for \"Mercury Rising\" is exceptionally tiresome and hard-to-swallow. ... Once again, certain standby plot elements -- the high-level government conspiracy and the maverick law enforcement agent -- are recycled, and not to good effect. While Bruce Willis can play the action hero as well as anyone in Hollywood, this particular outing leaves him marooned in situations that are characterized by too little tension and too much nonsense.\"\n\nThe film earned $10,104,715 in its opening weekend in 2,386 theaters. Altogether, the film grossed $32,935,289 in the United States and $60,172,000 internationally for a total of $93,107,289.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "21754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21754", "title": "Nation", "text": "Nation\n\nA nation is a stable community of people, formed on the basis of a common language, territory, economic life, ethnicity, or psychological make-up manifested in a common culture. A nation is distinct from a people, and is more abstract, and more overtly political, than an ethnic group. It is a cultural-political community that has become conscious of its autonomy, unity, and particular interests.\n\n\"Black's Law Dictionary\" defines a nation as follows:\nnation, \"n.\" (14c) 1. A large group of people having a common origin, language, and tradition and usu. constituting a political entity. • When a nation is coincident with a state, the term \"nation-state\" is often used...\n2. A community of people inhabiting a defined territory and organized under an independent government; a sovereign political state...\n\nErnest Renan's \"What is a Nation?\" (1882) declares that \"race is confused with nation and a sovereignty analogous to that of really existing peoples is attributed to ethnographic or, rather linguistic groups\", and \"[t]he truth is that there is no pure race and that to make politics depend upon ethnographic analysis is to surrender it to a chimera\", echoing a sentiment of civic nationalism. He also claims that a nation does not form on the basis of dynasty, language, religion, geography, or shared interests. Rather, \"[a] nation is a soul, a spiritual principle. Two things, which in truth are but one, constitute this soul or spiritual principle. One lies in the past, one in the present. One is the possession in common of a rich legacy of memories; the other is present-day consent, the desire to live together, the will to perpetuate the value of the heritage that one has received in an undivided form\", emphasizing the democratic and historical aspects of what constitutes a nation, although, \"[f]orgetting, I would even go so far as to say historical error, is a crucial factor in the creation of a nation\". \"A nation is therefore a large-scale solidarity\", which Renan says is reaffirmed in a \"daily plebiscite\".\n\nBenedict Anderson has characterised a nation as an \"imagined community\" and Paul James sees it as an \"abstract community\". A nation is an imagined community in the sense that the material conditions exist for imagining extended and shared connections. It is an abstract community in the sense that it is objectively impersonal, even if each individual in the nation experiences him or herself as subjectively part of an embodied unity with others. For the most part, members of a nation remain strangers to each other and will likely never meet. Hence the phrase, \"a nation of strangers\" used by such writers as Vance Packard.\n\nThe word \"nation\" came from the Old French word \"nacion\" – meaning \"birth\" (\"naissance\"), \"place of origin\" -, which in turn originates from the Latin word \"natio\" (\"nātĭō\") literally meaning \"birth\".\n\nThe word \"nation\" is sometimes used as synonym for:\n\nThus the phrase \"nations of the world\" could be referring to the top-level governments (as in the name for the United Nations), various large geographical territories, or various large ethnic groups of the planet.\n\nDepending on the meaning of \"nation\" used, the term \"nation state\" could be used to distinguish larger states from small city states, or could be used to distinguish multinational states from those with a single ethnic group.\n\nIn her book \"Kingdoms and Communities in Western Europe 900–1300\", Susan Reynolds argues that many European medieval kingdoms were nations in the modern sense except that political participation in nationalism was available only to a limited prosperous and literate class. In his book \"The Construction of Nationhood: Ethnicity, Religion and Nationalism\", Adrian Hastings argues that England's Anglo Saxon kings mobilized mass nationalism in their struggle to repel Norse invasions. Hastings argues that Alfred the Great, in particular, drew on biblical nationalism, using biblical language in his law code and that during his reign selected books of the Bible were translated into Old English to inspire Englishmen to fight to turn back the Norse invaders. Hastings argues for a strong renewal of English nationalism (following a hiatus after the Norman conquest) beginning with the translation of the complete bible into English by the Wycliffe circle in the 1380s, arguing that English nationalism and the English nation have been continuous since that time.\n\nAnother prudent example of Medieval nationalism is the Declaration of Arbroath, a document produced by Scottish nobles and clergy during the Scottish Wars of Independence. The purpose of the document was to demonstrate to the Pope that Scotland was indeed a nation of its own, with its own unique culture, history and language and that it was indeed an older nation than England. The document went on to justify the actions of Robert the Bruce and his forces in resisting the occupation and to chastise the English for having violated Scottish sovereignty without justification. The propaganda campaign supplemented a military campaign on the part of the Bruce, which after the Battle of Bannockburn was successful and eventually resulted in the end of England's occupation and recognition of Scottish independence on the part of the English crown. The document is widely seen as an early example of both Scottish nationalism and popular sovereignty.\n\nAnthony Kaldellis affirms in \"Hellenism in Byzantium\" (2008) that what is called the Byzantine Empire was the Roman Empire transformed into a nation-state in Middle Ages.\n\nAzar Gat is among the scholars who argue that China, Korea and Japan were nations by the time of the European Middle Ages.\n\nA significant early use of the term \"nation\", as \"natio\", occurred at Medieval universities to describe the colleagues in a college or students, above all at the University of Paris, who were all born within a \"pays\", spoke the same language and expected to be ruled by their own familiar law. In 1383 and 1384, while studying theology at Paris, Jean Gerson was elected twice as a procurator for the French \"natio\". The University of Prague adopted the division of students into \"nationes\": from its opening in 1349 the \"studium generale\" which consisted of Bohemian, Bavarian, Saxon and Silesian \"nations\".\n\nIn a similar way, the \"nationes\" were segregated by the Knights Hospitaller of Jerusalem, who maintained at Rhodes the hostels from which they took their name \"where foreigners eat and have their places of meeting, each nation apart from the others, and a Knight has charge of each one of these hostels, and provides for the necessities of the inmates according to their religion\", as the Spanish traveller Pedro Tafur noted in 1436.\n\nIn his article, \"The Mosaic Moment: An Early Modernist Critique of the Modernist Theory of Nationalism\", Philip S. Gorski argues that the first modern nation was the Dutch Republic, created by a fully modern political nationalism rooted in the model of biblical nationalism. In a 2013 article \"Biblical nationalism and the sixteenth-century states\", Diana Muir Appelbaum expands Gorski's argument to apply to a series of new, Protestant, sixteenth-century nation states. A similar, albeit broader, argument was made by Anthony D. Smith in his books, \"Chosen Peoples: Sacred Sources of National Identity\" and \"Myths and Memories of the Nation\".\nIn her book \"Nationalism: Five Roads to Modernity\", Liah Greenfeld argued that nationalism was invented in England by 1600. According to Greenfeld, England was “the first nation in the world\".\n\nIn the late 20th century, many social scientists argued that there were two types of nations, the civic nation of which France was the principal example and the ethnic nation exemplified by the German peoples. The German tradition was conceptualized as originating with early 19th-century philosophers, like Johann Gottlieb Fichte, and referred to people sharing a common language, religion, culture, history, and ethnic origins, that differentiate them from people of other nations. On the other hand, the civic nation was traced to the French Revolution and ideas deriving from 18th-century French philosophers. It was understood as being centered in a willingness to \"live together\", this producing a nation that results from an act of affirmation. This is the vision, among others, of Ernest Renan.\n\nPresent day analysis tend to be based in socio-historical studies about the building of national identity sentiments, trying to identify the individual and collective mechanisms, either conscient or non-conscient, intended or un-intended. According to some of these studies, it seems that the State often plays a significant role, and communications, particularly of economic content, also have a high significance.\n\nThere is an ongoing debate about the future of nations − about whether this framework will persist as is and whether there are viable or developing alternatives.\n\nThe theory of the clash of civilizations lies in direct contrast to cosmopolitan theories about an ever more-connected world that no longer requires nation states. According to political scientist Samuel P. Huntington, people's cultural and religious identities will be the primary source of conflict in the post–Cold War world.\n\nThe theory was originally formulated in a 1992 lecture at the American Enterprise Institute, which was then developed in a 1993 \"Foreign Affairs\" article titled \"The Clash of Civilizations?\", in response to Francis Fukuyama's 1992 book, \"The End of History and the Last Man\". Huntington later expanded his thesis in a 1996 book \"The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order\".\n\nHuntington began his thinking by surveying the diverse theories about the nature of global politics in the post–Cold War period. Some theorists and writers argued that human rights, liberal democracy and capitalist free market economics had become the only remaining ideological alternative for nations in the post–Cold War world. Specifically, Francis Fukuyama, in \"The End of History and the Last Man\", argued that the world had reached a Hegelian \"end of history\".\n\nHuntington believed that while the age of ideology had ended, the world had reverted only to a normal state of affairs characterized by cultural conflict. In his thesis, he argued that the primary axis of conflict in the future will be along cultural and religious lines.\nPostnationalism is the process or trend by which nation states and national identities lose their importance relative to supranational and global entities. Several factors contribute to its aspects including economic globalization, a rise in importance of multinational corporations, the internationalization of financial markets, the transfer of socio-political power from national authorities to supernational entities, such as multinational corporations, the United Nations and the European Union and the advent of new information and culture technologies such as the Internet. However attachment to citizenship and national identities often remains important.\n\nJan Zielonka of the University of Oxford states that \"the future structure and exercise of political power will resemble the medieval model more than the Westphalian one\" with the latter being about \"concentration of power, sovereignty and clear-cut identity\" and neo-medievalism meaining \"overlapping authorities, divided sovereignty, multiple identities and governing institutions, and fuzzy borders\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6814749", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6814749", "title": "Omphalion", "text": "Omphalion\n\nOmphalion in Greek means \"navel (of the earth)\"; compare the \"omphalos\" of Delphi.\n\nOne of the most intriguing features of St. Sophia is a marble section of the floor known as the Omphalos. The Omphalos is located in the south-east quarter of the main square beneath the dome, exactly in the middle of the square. Each side measures 5.65 meters (18.5 feet). Within the square lay 30 circles of various sizes. There is one large circle in the middle; 4 circles of equal size at each corner; 2 smaller circles of similar size occupy the space between each corner circle; 16 smaller circles in-between these. The 3 remaining circles are on the south end and are linked to the 4 larger circles on that end. \n\nThe most striking feature of the Omphalos is the brilliant marble, with a myriad of types and colors mixed in. Marble was the material of choice for Imperial churches. Strangely, it was believed to be created by earthy matter freezing in water that had sunk into the Earth's crust. The design is unusual and has been interpreted in many ways over the years. One interpretation could be that is that the central circle could be the sun, with the solar system orbiting around it. This would fit with the absolute rule of the Emperor. The asymmetry is particularly odd, given when compared to the omphalos at Hosios Loukas in Greece. This omphalos dates from the Middle Byzantine, some five hundred years after the St. Sophia's if it is indeed an original feature, and is completely symmetrical in design. Stylistically, the interiors of Hagia Sophia have been categorized as a \"jeweled style\". The materials utilized were selected to retain and reflect light. The mosaics used tesserae of varying colors, texturized and oriented to reflect the light pouring in from the massive dome. Color was very important as certain colors, and certain materials, conveyed messages of status and prestige. The effect of the sunlight shining through the windows surrounding the base of the dome hitting the tesserae would have been awe-inspiring. Comparatively, the Omphalos is more demure and understated.\n\nHistorically, it was thought to mark the spot where Byzantine emperors were crowned during the coronation ceremony. Evidence of this comes from Antony of Novgorod, who wrote a description of St. Sophia in the early 13th century. He wrote \"there is a red marble stone with a golden throne placed on it. On this throne the emperors were crowned\". This view has been challenged over the years because of the dearth of textual reference from writers and travelers in the Byzantine Era. Hagia Sophia herself has been altered so many times since the sixth-century that the Omphalion disappears and re-appears sporadically in the textual evidence that does exist. We know that it was covered over with carpets by the Ottomans after they converted it into a mosque. The design is unique to Hagia Sophia, with little in the way of direct comparisons. There are two examples from the 11th and 12th centuries, Hosios Lukas and Nea Moni. The comparison is difficult considering the 500 year difference. All of the marble used in the floors of St. Sophia was quarried around the time of construction. \n\nByzantine architecture of the time favored the incorporation of spolia to celebrate the triumph of Christianity over Paganism, as much of the spolia was sourced from Greek and Roman temples throughout the Empire. Dating of the Omphalos has varied, with some dating it to the reign of Justinian, and some dating it as a later addition, particularly to the reign of Basil I (867-886). The evidence used to argue for this later dating is the seemingly odd placement within Hagia Sophia. However, it is placed in the center of one of the four squares beneath the dome, indicating the placement was not as random as it seems at first glance. Historian Nadine Schibille argues that it fits seamlessly into the original flooring, therefore she concludes that it was an original feature. Historian Silvia Pedone does not attempt to assign a specific date to it, but she theorizes that it was arranged differently than what is seen today. Some of the smaller circles might have been an addition during re-decoration in the 9th century. The church suffered damage during an earthquake in 1346 that could have damaged the marble. This could account for the asymmetrical design, with repairs altering the overall design.\n\nThe word \"omphalion\" is also used to describe other sacred circular marking slabs that were usually located in important or especially sacred churches throughout the Byzantine Empire.\n\nThe marble omphalion from the floor of the Church of Hagia Sophia in Trabzon (north coast of modern Turkey) was brought to Thessalonica by Greek refugees in 1924.\n\n"}

This is a kind of medical reconnaissance, process of information gathering on possible infectious diseases' origin-sources, the ways and factors of the infection transfer and determining all conditions that could have promoted the spread of infestation among army service personnel. \nIn 1939 Academician E.N.Pavlovsky announced his \"doctrine of nidality\", so called by Soviet biologists. People can acquire zoonoses and insect-borne diseases when they occupy at certain times of the year natural habitat of a certain pathogen (plague, tularemia, leptospirosis, arboviruses, tick-borne relapsing fever. The WHO Expert Committee on Zoonoses listed over 100 such diseases. About natural focality of the diseases is known elsewhere.\n\nHistorically, Sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance implied collection and transfer of all data available on sanitary and epidemiological situation of the area of possible deployment and action of armed forces, the same data for the neighbouring and enemy armed forces. The aim for the reconnaissance was to clear up the reasons of the specific disease origin—sources of the infection in various extreme situations, including local wars and armed conflicts, the ways of the infection transfer and all factors promoting to the infestation. \nThis practice has been successfully used on plague-endemic territory at the time of the Soviet–Japanese War (1945) in WWII : \"Sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance was organized and conducted continuously for the entire depth of the operation. Mobile sanitary epidemiological detachments followed immediately behind the first echelon of tanks and mechanized vehicles of advancing Soviet army should they encounter any particular contagious disease. Withdrawing enemy forces had poisoned many wells and water sources\". \nAfter the armed forces have become stationary during wartime and emergency of peace time the sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance turns into sanitary and epidemiological surveillance and medical control of vital and communal activity of the armed forces.\n\nSanitary epidemiological reconnaissance as a practice has nothing in common with the Epidemic Intelligence Service as an educational program of the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The latter was established in 1951 by Alexander Langmuir, due to biological warfare concerns arising from the Korean War, it has become a hands-on two-year postgraduate training program in epidemiology.\n\nThe use of sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance or similar practices in the armed forces is mentioned elsewhere. The Polish contingents serving under the UN auspices focused their tasks among others on ... sanitary-epidemiological reconnaissance ... .\nThe similar practice is recognized by the WHO and Australia while encompassing chemical, radiological hazards as well. They call it \"All-hazards approach\" US Department of Health and Human Services in the page 300 of its manual in admits existence of other surveillance systems calling them \"early-warning systems of disease potential\" with the aim to collect data on indicators of disease or disease potential: animal population (animal morbidity and mortality by a disease that can affect humans, the presence of a disease agent in wild and domestic sentinel animals, vectors of a disease) and environmental data.\n\nThere is a definite need in mobile sanitary-epidemiological groups, trained and equipped for the task. Any group for sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance includes: epidemiologist, specialist on infections, assistant of epidemiologist (bacteriologist-lab assistant), medical orderly (if necessary, the group will include zoologist or parasitologist). These units should be formed up in the deployable medical set-ups. Sanitary-epidemiological reconnaissance should result in revealing of the patients and persons, suspected to the specific disease, their isolation and hospitalization.\n\nA sanitary-epidemiological kit is constructed, consisting of two separate units, but each adaptable to use with the other: a portable laboratory kit and a portable combination lab apparatus. The two units can be useful in the work of epidemiologists during sanitary-epidemiological reconnaissance and sanitary epidemiological surveys.\n\nIn 2010 at The Meeting of the States Parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and Their Destruction in Geneva the sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance was suggested as well-tested means for enhancing the monitoring of infections and parasitic agents, for practical implementation of the International Health Regulations (2005). The aim was to prevent and minimize the consequences of natural outbreaks of dangerous infectious diseases as well as the threat of alleged use of biological weapons against BTWC States Parties. It is pointed out the significance of the sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance in assessing the sanitary-epidemiological situation, organizing and conducting preventive activities, indicating and identifying pathogenic biological agents in the environmental sites, conducting laboratory analysis of biological materials, suppressing hotbeds of infectious diseases, providing advisory and practical assistance to local health authorities.\n\nSanitary epidemiological reconnaissance (inspection) or a similar practice and specific indication in the hotbed should be performed immediately after the receiving of the information about bio-terrorism attack.\n\nThere were compiled the principles of organization of sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance and criteria for evaluating the sanitary epidemiological status of arms force and regions of their dislocation.\n"}
{"id": "42701081", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42701081", "title": "Sociology of Jewry", "text": "Sociology of Jewry\n\nThe sociology of Jewry involves the application of sociological theory and method to the study of the Jewish people and the Jewish religion. Sociologists are concerned with the social patterns within Jewish groups and communities; American Jewry, Israeli Jews and Jewish life in the diaspora. Sociological studies of the Jewish religion include religious membership, ritual and denominational patterns. Notable journals include \"Jewish Social Studies\", \"The Jewish Journal of Sociology\" and \"Contemporary Jewry.\n\nSociology of Jewry initially emerged in the United States in the 1930s beginning with the 1938 publication of \"Jewish Social Studies\", sponsored by the Conference of Jewish Relations. The Journal's mission was \"to promote, by means of scientific research, a better understanding of the position of Jews in the modern world.\" And the later publication of \"The Jewish Journal of Sociology\" in 1958 was due to the \"few opportunities... for publishing academic and scientific studies of the sociology of Jews.\"\n\nIn 1955, sociologist Seymour Lipset noted that the discipline was underdeveloped, stating that there were far more \"Jewish sociologists\" than \"sociologists of Jews\". However, the subfield began to grow in the late 1960s and 1970s. A professional organization was formed, namely the Association for the Social Scientific Study of Jewry (ASSJ). In 1975, a new academic journal was founded as well, \"Contemporary Jewry\".\n\nContributing to this growth was the work of Marshall Sklare, now considered one of the founding figures in the sociology of Jewry. Marshall Sklare and Joseph Greenblum’s 1967 study of Jewish identity in “Lakeville” is considered one of the most notable works of its kind. The sociological study of intergroup relations and the theories proposed by Nathan Glazer and Daniel P. Moynihan is also thought to have contributed to the growth of the sociology of Jewry.\n\nThe idea for the formation of a professional organization for scholars specializing in the sociology of Jewry first surfaced in 1966; the concept was discussed by Werner J. Cahnman and Norman L. Friedman at an American Sociological Association (ASA) conference. The association was informally launched by Norman Friedman and Bernard Lazerwitz in 1970; the event, titled \"The Sociological Study of Jewry\" took place at the ASA annual conference. Sociologists Solomon Poll, Mervin Verbit and Arnold Dashevsky submitted a motion to establish a formal group; the motion was voted upon and accepted. The new group, the Association for the Social Scientific Study of Jewry (ASSJ or ASSSJ) was launched and formally met the following year. The group has since organized annual conferences, established the academic journal \"Contemporary Jewry\", founded the \"ASSJ Newsletter\" and honors exceptional scholars in the field with the Marshall Sklare Award.\n\nWhile the ASSJ and \"Contemporary Jewry\" are dominated by sociologists and sociological studies - all but one of the organization's presidents earned a doctorate in sociology, the other received a doctorate in psychology - the focus has not been restricted to sociology alone. Studies involving other social sciences and history are included as well, and professionals from those disciplines have joined as members, contributors and honorees.\n\nAccording to sociologist Samuel Heilman, there are three major theoretical approaches in studying the sociology of American Jewry in particular:\n\nWhile other theoretical approaches have been advanced they have not majorly impacted the discipline's research agenda.\n\nSamuel Klausner, a former president of the ASSJ, noted that the sociology of Jewry is more an applied social science than a theoretical one. For Klausner, theories developed in sociology may help explain any society, not just a Jewish one. The contribution of the sociology of Jewry therefore is the application of the science, such as its methodology. Others, however, stress that the subfield is a part of general comparative sociology.\n\nIn 1946, Kurt H. Wolff, a student of Karl Mannheim, published “An Elementary Syllabus in the Sociology of the Jews” in \"Social Forces\", a notable sociology journal. Wolff's aim was to provide an aid to including material on Jews in courses on race relations, social disorganization, minorities, and/or introductory sociology. Wolff's syllabus focused on three topics:\n\nLater scholars have noted that Wolff's syllabus on the Sociology of Jewry sought to study external structures but ignored the internal dynamics of the Jewish community.\n\nIn 1992, Rabbi Jack Nusan Porter edited the first syllabus collection and curriculum guide on the Sociology of Jewry. The collection was published by the American Sociological Association (ASA). The collection included individual syllabi on the sociology of Jews from 34 colleges and universities. However, Porter found that many of the syllabi focused exclusively on Jewish life in America. And only 10 out of 34 syllabi were from sociology departments.\n\nPaul Burstein of the University of Washington compiled an updated collection of syllabi on the sociology of Jewry. This collection was published by the American Sociological Association (ASA) in 2007. In his work, Burstein focuses on the following themes:\n\nBurstein notes gaps in specific areas. For example, while Black-Jewish relations in the U.S. is covered in the syllabi, relations between Jews and other groups is not. Also, there are few areas covered outside of American and Israeli Jewry.\n\n"}

Stonecoast enrolls approximately 100 students in four major genres: creative nonfiction, fiction, poetry, and popular fiction. Other areas of student interest, including literary translation, performance, writing for stage and screen, writing Nature, and cross-genre writing, are pursued as elective options. Students also choose one track that focuses an intensive research project in their third semester from among these categories: craft, creative collaboration, literary theory, publishing, social justice/community service, and teaching/pedagogy. Stonecoast is one of only two graduate creative writing programs in the country offering a degree in popular fiction. It is accredited through the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC).\n\nThe Stonecoast MFA program is a low-residency program. Ten-day residencies for students, faculty, and visiting writers are held each January and June. Each semester, a group of ten students also goes to Ireland for a smaller residency. Residencies involve an intensive schedule of workshops, classes, readings, and gatherings. The rest of a student's academic work during the two-year program is pursued on a one-on-one basis under the leadership of a faculty mentor.\n\nFounded in 2002 by Barbara Lee Hope, Ken Rosen, and Dianne Benedict, Stonecoast came to national prominence under the direction of poet Annie Finch who served as director from 2004 to 2013. Stonecoast is one of the oldest and best-known of the second wave of low-residency graduate programs in creative writing, following on the first wave of the Warren Wilson, Goddard, and Bennington graduate programs. Stonecoast departed from its predecessor programs in a number of significant ways including more flexibility in cross-genre work, more student input into mentor choice and curriculum, seminar-style classes as opposed to lectures, and more flexibility in third-semester projects. The program received coverage in \"The Atlantic Monthly\" feature on MFA programs focusing in particular on its Ireland residency and popular fiction component. Other innovative curricular features include a foundation workshop in poetic meter for incoming poets and student-initiated elective workshops on special topics in writing.\n\nStonecoast has been ranked consistently among the \"Top Ten Low-Residency Programs\" by \"Poets & Writers\" magazine since 2011.\n\nHistory:\n\nThe Stonecoast MFA faculty has won numerous awards including Guggenheim and National Endowment for the Arts grants, Astraea, Hugo, Lambda, and Hurston/Wright Legacy awards, a Lannan Foundation Grant, the American Book Award, and the Whiting Writer’s Award.

Another tradition is a vagina that acquires the power of speech to play the role of informant and reveal a history of previous lovers.\n\nTalking vaginas are an early theme in French literature, most notably in the 13th century fabliau \"Le Chevalier qui faisoit parler les cons et les culs\" and in \"Les bijoux indiscrets\", the first novel by Denis Diderot.

This late Neoclassical style red brick and cast stone structure is tall, and its exterior dimensions are deep and wide. Its interior dimensions are approximately by , or approximately . Steep, narrow, internal stairways leading to the upper floors occupy roughly 25 percent of the interior area.\n\nReportedly the result of a fraudulent investment scheme by a confidence man, the Newby-McMahon Building was a source of great embarrassment to the city and its residents after its completion in 1919. During the 1920s, the Newby-McMahon Building was featured in Robert Ripley's \"Ripley's Believe It or Not!\" syndicated column as \"the world's littlest skyscraper,\" a nickname that has stuck with it ever since. The Newby-McMahon Building is now part of the Depot Square Historic District of Wichita Falls, a Texas Historic Landmark.\n\nA large petroleum reservoir was discovered just west of the city of Burkburnett, a small town in Wichita County, Texas in 1912. Burkburnett and its surrounding communities became boomtowns, experiencing explosive growth of their populations and economies. By 1918, an estimated 20,000 new settlers had taken up residence around the lucrative oil field, and many Wichita County residents became wealthy virtually overnight. As people streamed into the local communities in search of high-paying jobs, the nearby city of Wichita Falls began to grow in importance. Though it initially lacked the necessary infrastructure for this sudden increase in economic and industrial activity, Wichita Falls was a natural choice to serve as the local logistical hub, being the seat of Wichita County. Because office space was lacking, major stock transactions and mineral rights deals were conducted on street corners and in tents that served as makeshift headquarters for the new oil companies.\n\nThe Newby-McMahon Building is a four-story brick building located near the railroad depot in downtown Wichita Falls, built in 1906 by Augustus Newby (1855–1909), a director of the Wichita Falls and Oklahoma City Railway Company. The oil-rig construction firm of J.D. McMahon, a petroleum landman and structural engineer from Philadelphia, was one of seven tenants whose offices were based in the original Newby Building.\n\nAccording to local legend, when McMahon announced in 1919 that he would build a highrise annex to the Newby Building as a solution to the newly wealthy city's urgent need for office space, investors were eager to invest in the project. McMahon collected $200,000 (US $ in 2018) in investment capital from this group of naive investors, promising to construct a highrise office building across the street from the St. James Hotel.\n\nThe key to McMahon's swindle, and his successful defense in the ensuing lawsuit, was that he never verbally stated that the actual height of the building would be . The proposed skyscraper depicted in the blueprints that he distributed (and which were approved by the investors) was clearly labeled as consisting of four floors and .\n\nMcMahon used his own construction crews to build the McMahon Building on the small, unused piece of property next to the Newby Building, without obtaining prior consent from the owner of the property, who lived in Oklahoma. As the building began to take shape, the investors realized they had been swindled into purchasing a four-story edifice that was only tall, rather than the structure they were expecting.\n\nThey brought a lawsuit against McMahon, but to their dismay, the real estate and construction deal was declared legally binding by a local judge – as McMahon had built exactly according to the blueprints they had approved, no legal remedy was available for the deceived investors. They did recover a small portion of their investment from the elevator company, which refused to honor the contract after they learned of the confidence trick. No stairway was installed in the building upon its initial completion, as none was included in the original blueprints. Rather, a ladder was employed to gain access to the upper three floors. By the time construction was complete, McMahon had left Wichita Falls and perhaps even Texas, taking with him the balance of the investors' money.\n\nUpon its completion and opening in 1919, the Newby-McMahon Building was an immediate source of great embarrassment to the city and its residents. The ground floor had six desks representing the six different companies that occupied the building as its original tenants. Throughout most of the 1920s, the building housed only two firms. During the 1920s, the Newby-McMahon Building was featured in Robert Ripley's \"Ripley's Believe It or Not!\" syndicated column as \"the world's littlest skyscraper\", which is a name that has stuck with it ever since.\n\nThe oil industry would ultimately prove to be a resource curse to Wichita Falls, and the Texas Oil Boom ended only a few years later. The building was vacated, boarded up, and virtually forgotten in 1929 as the Great Depression struck North Texas and office space became relatively inexpensive to lease or purchase. A fire gutted the building in 1931, rendering it unusable for a number of years.\n\nAfter the Great Depression, the building housed a succession of tenants, including barber shops and cafés. The building changed hands many times and was scheduled for demolition on several occasions, but escaped this fate apparently because a sufficient number of local residents came to its defense. It was eventually deeded to the city of Wichita Falls. As the building continued to deteriorate, in 1986 the city gave the building to the Wichita County Heritage Society (WCHS), with the hope that it would eventually be restored, making it a viable part of the Depot Square Historic District.\n\nBy 1999, the Newby-McMahon Building had proved to be an excessive burden on the limited capital reserves of the WCHS. The following year, the city council hired the local architectural firm of Bundy, Young, Sims & Potter to stabilize the crumbling structure, amid steadily growing talk of demolishing the building. Dick Bundy and his partners became fascinated with the history and legacy of the building; they arranged a partnership with Marvin Groves Electric, another local business, to purchase the building. In December 2000, the city council voted to allow the WCHS to sell the building to Marvin Groves for $3,748.\n\nOn June 11, 2003, a storm swept through Wichita Falls, bringing gusts of wind as strong as . A 15-ft (4.6-m) section of brick wall from the McMahon Building complex was knocked down. The damage from this storm was repaired, but full restoration of the building and the adjacent Newby Building was delayed until late 2005. In June of that year, the City Council granted $25,000 in funds from the city's tax increment financing fund, to be invested in the restoration of the McMahon Building. Restoration of the building is estimated to have cost more than $254,000, the remainder of which was paid by the owners (Bundy, Young, Sims & Potter, Inc. and Marvin Groves Electric).\n\nWith the passage of time, the Newby-McMahon Building has become a monument to a long-gone era. It has survived tornadoes, a fire, and decades of neglect to stand as a monument to the greed, genius, graft, and gullibility of the oil boom days of North Texas. The building is currently part of the Depot Square Historic District of Wichita Falls, which has been declared a Texas Historic Landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The building has never met the criteria for the definition of a skyscraper, nor even that of a \"highrise\" building. After its renovation, the building was home to an antiques dealership, the Antique Wood, which opened in 2006 on the ground floor. Since 2013, besides being a local tourist attraction, a furniture and home décor consignment boutique, Hello Again has occupied the entire building. At times, floors of the skyscraper have been subleased to various local artisans.\n\nThe Newby-McMahon Building is among several historic buildings featured in the documentary film \"Wichita Falls: The Future of Our Past\", a retrospective analysis of the city's architectural past produced in 2006 by Barry Levy, a public information officer with the city of Wichita Falls.\n\n"}
