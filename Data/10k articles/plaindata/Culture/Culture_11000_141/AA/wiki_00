{"id": "10252359", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10252359", "title": "ArtBots", "text": "ArtBots\n\nArtBots: The Robot Talent Show is an international robot talent show held in New York City and other cities. It is sponsored by a variety of arts organizations, produced by an army of volunteers, and is directed and curated by dorkbot founder, and teacher Douglas Repetto. \n\nArtBots is vaguely modeled on a tongue-in-cheek version of Battlebots, where robotic art submissions are curated for a group show based not on their ability to fight one another, but on their ability to make (or be) art. Repetto felt that there was too much attention focused on \"violent, competitive aspects of robotics\" and wished to create something more comprehensive. Repetto also described how robots have a \"creative side.\"\n\nRobots competing in ArtBots were very diverse in function and build. An interesting inclusion was Tribbalation, a round, whiskered robot which through sensors responds to \"stimuli like compliments and stroking.\" Neil is a humanoid robot that responds to participants and emotes moods based on its interaction. Robozoic, by Brett Doar, has a very simple brain created with a rotating cylinder which works similarly to a music box. Robots in ArtBots aren't always the art itself, for example, some robots participating draw or create music. One especially interesting artistic robot was MEART, a brain-cell/mechanical arm hybrid which creates abstract \"portraits.\" \n\nThe show runs for a number of days, and two (nominal) prizes are awarded: the People's Choice Award goes to the work that gets the most audience votes, while the Robot Choice Award is decided on by the artists themselves. Winners of the 2003 competition included the League of Electronic Musical Urban Robots (LEMUR), which consisted of five robots which acted as self-playing instruments and took the Audience Choice Award. The winners of the Robots' Choice Award was micro.adam and micro.eva who respond to one another.\n\nArtBots is dedicated to the creation, presentation, and celebration of robotic art and art-making robotics, and to the promotion of the idea that robotics, and new technologies in general, are accessible, fun, intelligible, and useful, and that everyone, not just a technological elite, can participate in and influence society's technological progress. However, some artists working with electronics and robotics are invited to participate in ArtBots, showing a \"kinetic tree\" at the 2005 festival. Workshops have been included at some festivals to teach participants how to create their own robots.\n\nIn 2002, ArtBots was featured at the Pratt Institute. In 2003, it was held as a festival at Eyebeam, a gallery in Chelsea. Dublin hosted the 2005 festival and it was the first time ArtBots was held outside of New York. In 2006 and 2007, it took place in New York. The 2011 event took place in Gent, Belgium. \n\n"}

{"id": "25987296", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25987296", "title": "Badnjak (Croatian)", "text": "Badnjak (Croatian)\n\nBadnjak (), refers to a log brought into the house and placed on the fire on the evening of Christmas Eve, a central tradition in Croatian Christmas celebration, much like a yule log in other European traditions. In Croatian the name for Christmas Eve is derived from the term \"badnjak.\" The log is cut with great ceremony on Christmas Eve morning, which for Roman Catholic Croats is December 24. The cutting, preparation, bringing in, and laying on the fire are surrounded by elaborate religious rituals, with many regional variations. The log is kept burning throughout Christmas Day.\n\nWith increased urbanization and migrations to cities, the badnjak tradition has recently been limited to more rural areas, as many urban homes do not have a hearth or fireplace, increasing the risk of a fire hazard, along with the fact that it is near impossible to cut one's own log in the city. Instead, some may chose to have a symbolic log kept in the home.\n\nThe term \"badnjak\" comes from the old Slavic words \"bodar\" or \"badar\", which means \"to be awake\" (\"bdjeti\"). This refers to staying awake throughout the night to tend to the badnjak and wait for the coming of the saviour Jesus Christ on Christmas Day. The term badnjak lends itself to the literal meaning of Christmas Eve, with Badnji Dan meaning Christmas Eve Day, and Badnja Večer meaning Christmas Eve night.\n\nThere are many interpretations for the meaning of the badnjak, but scholars agree that it is a remnant of pagan Indo-European times that has adapted to Christianity. Today, the festive kindling of the log commemorates the fire that—according to folk tradition—the shepherds of Bethlehem built in the cave where Jesus Christ was born, to warm the baby Jesus and his mother Mary throughout the night. The badnjak may also be seen as a symbol of the cross upon which Christ was crucified, the warmth of its fire symbolizing the salvation which, in the Christian belief, the crucifixion made possible for mankind. As the log burned and turned into ashes, it symbolized Christ's resurrection and his triumph over sin. Scholars regard the tradition as inherited from the old Slavic religion, where Christians began referring to the celebration of Christmas as the Feast of Lights. They interpret the badnjak as an incarnation of the spirit of vegetation, and as a divinity who dies by burning to be reborn, to whom sacrifices and prayers were offered for the fertility of fields, the health and happiness of the family, in which the rekindling of the hearth-fire symbolizes its importance and center of family life throughout many generations. In some parts, some people focus more on the cult of their dead, where they equate the burning fire to their departed family members.\n\nAmong Croats of the Roman Catholic faith, Christmas Eve begins on December 24. Early in the morning, traditionally before dawn, the father or another male of the household goes into the forest to chop a piece of log, usually from an oak tree if it could be found, but, if the region does not have any, than beech, olive, or maple can be used. When the perfect tree is found, the father would invoke God by reciting the Lord's Prayer several times and making the Sign of the Cross and would then cut it. When the father arrives back home with the badnjak, he announces \"May Jesus and Mary be praised! I wish you a good Christmas Eve\" (\"Faljen Isus i Marija! Dobro Vam došla Badnja Večer\"), and the family replies \"Today and always.\" The greeting can differ slightly among different regions; in Slavonia for example, the father would say, May Jesus be praised! I wish you a good Christmas Eve and Adam and Eve [feast day] (\"Faljen Isus! Čestita vam badnja večer i Adam i Eva\"). In the Croatian Catholic calendar, December 24 is the feast day of Adam and Eve. The log is placed on the porch and is not brought into the house until the evening. \n\nWhen evening comes, the badnjak log is placed in the hearth. In Dalmatia, as the badnjak is brought into the home, it is sprinkled with wine and grain. In the southern part, women would adorn the logs with leaves and flowers and wrap them around with red and gold ribbons. In Dubrovnik, the father sprinkles corn and wine on the badnjak while reciting prayers. In other regions, the badnjak is sprinkled with wheat and holy water, while in Hercegovina the badnjak is completely bathed in holy water. As the log is lit, the father of the family recites the Apostle's Creed. In southern Dalmatia, two logs are often placed in the shape of a cross. After the log is lit, he says \"Jesus be praised. Welcome Christmas Eve.\" Sometimes, more holy water is sprinkled on the badnjak after it is lit. Depending on the region, people may choose to sprinkle bits of wheat grain, or even add some of the evening meal to the badnjak. In Istria, if wine or rakija is sprinkled on the badnjak, a family member toasts: \"Drink to your health\" (\"Pij u tvoje zdravlje\") believing if they don't then ill fortune will come to them. The log is usually allowed to burn all night into Christmas Day, and family members often take turns all night ensuring the log does not go out.\nThe Badnjak must last all evening and in many regions, it is burned again. In certain regions, it is re-lit in the New Year on the Feast of The Three Kings and sometimes it stays by the hearth until Lent, where it serves as a special log upon which other logs are placed. In the villages, the ashes or charred fragments of the badnjak are scattered in the fields to assure a fruitful crop.\n\nMuch like other European countries, Croatia has specific traditional celebrations that go along with the felling and lighting of the badnjak. The day is spent in preparation for Christmas, with the home being decorated and the feast for the next day being prepared, and all chores must be done before the ringing of the church bells and the lighting of the badnjak. The Christmas tree, which first arrived in Croatia in the mid-19th century, is still relatively new and is usually decorated on Christmas Eve. Other more traditional Croatian decorations include children hanging greenery throughout the home, such as holly branches, sage, ivy and evergreen wreaths, which are seen as a symbol of the strength of life in the middle of winter. Nativity scenes are usually present in every Christian home, and are generally kept under the tree or in another prominent location. \n\nAnother old tradition is sowing wheat seeds in a bowl of water (usually on St. Lucy's day), which will grow until Christmas and is then used to decorate the table on Christmas. The wheat is trimmed and usually wrapped with a red, white, and blue ribbon of the Croatian tricolour. Most Croats put candles or other objects such as apples in the middle of the wheat, with candles symbolizing the birth of Christ. A bundle of straw is brought into the house by the head of the family, who greets the home with a Christmas wish, and the straw is then spread under the table and throughout the house, symbolizing the birth of Christ in the manger. Families usually sit on the straw after dinner when gathered around the badnjak. \n\nThroughout the day, the woman of the house prepares the Christmas meal, which usually consists of many courses and desserts. Traditional foods include lamb, roasted pig, sarma with sauerkraut and sausage, stuffed peppers, pita, salad, and freshly baked bread. Some traditional Christmas desserts include fritule, kroštule, strudel, orahnjača, makovnjača, Bishop's bread, and gugelhupf. \n\nSince Christmas Eve is a fasting day, the family only has a small meal at dinnertime. For Badnjak supper, baklar (cod fish) from Dalmatia is eaten along with a salad or cabbage. A large supply of dried fruits, honey, and nuts (mainly walnuts and almonds) are always kept at home and eaten throughout the Christmas season.\n\n\n"}

It was the second episode of series 6 and first broadcast on 15 January 1989. In the episode, Del acquires a batch of faulty sex dolls, which have inadvertently been filled with an explosive gas.\n\nThe episode title is a reference to the 1979 TV series \"Danger UXB\", where UXB stood for \"unexploded bomb\"; \"UXD\" thus suggests \"unexploded dolls.\" On 21 December 2006, a scene from this episode was voted number 4 in the UKTV Gold Top 40 Greatest Only Fools Moments. The scene in question was that when one of the blow up dolls blows up by itself, which lead Del Boy, Rodney, and Uncle Albert to leave the room in a panic.\n\nWhile continuing to follow the yuppy lifestyle, Del Boy encourages Rodney to join in the fun. Also, Del's latest items to flog are video recorders from Ronnie Nelson and fresh tomatoes from Jersey.\n\nAt the \"Nag's Head\", Denzil tells Mike and the Trotters that he took his wife, Corrine out for the evening to celebrate their anniversary, despite picking up a faulty stock of 50 dolls from a shop in High Wycombe and having to take them back to the factory, intending to take them in Monday. However, there was a fire at the factory so Denzil cannot take them in, and has to hand in a form to show he returned the dolls. Del forges a signature from the factory and buys the dolls off Denzil.\n\nBack at the flat, the Trotters discover that the dolls are uninflated sex dolls called Lusty Linda and Erotic Estelle. Del suggests that they take the dolls down to a man named Dirty Barry, who owns a sex shop.\n\nAt a Chinese takeaway, Denzil watches \"London Plus\" and finds out that the dolls are filled with propane gas, which will explode if exposed to heat, and is suspected to have caused the destruction of the factory. Denzil zooms out of the takeaway after paying, but not claiming his meal.\n\nThat night, back at the flat, after Del find that the video recorder has recorded the wrong programme, Rodney informs Del that the machines are made only for use in mainland Europe and cannot be used in the United Kingdom. Del admits that he has already sold most of them! At that moment, the two sex dolls from behind the cocktail bar inflate. The Trotters proceed to deflate the dolls, but cannot due to their faulty valves. Rodney suggests they burst them but is told not to by Del. When Rodney gets dressed for a date with Cassandra, Del gets an idea on how to get the dolls to Dirty Barry's.\n\nBack at the Nag's Head, Trigger complains about the \"fresh Jersey\" tomatoes, and Boycie turns out to be the one who bought the faulty video recorders. Denzil comes bursting in and tells them about the dolls and how he has to get in touch with Del. Boycie and Mike cackle nastily on hearing that Del has fifty time bombs on his hands.\n\nOutside Nelson Mandela House, Rodney and Del come out with the two dolls dressed in their late mother Joan's clothes. An old man mistakes them for real women and Del imitates a female voice. The Trotters throw the dolls in their van, and Rodney heads off to meet up with Cassandra, leaving Del and Albert to drive down to Dirty Barry's. Del and Albert arrive at Dirty Barry's place, only to find out that he has had his licence revoked by the council. With nowhere else to drop them off, Del and Albert head back to the van to think of another way to get rid of the dolls. Del thinks they should hold them until the market picks up again.\n\nAt a restaurant, Cassandra warns Rodney of the unexploded sex dolls that she has heard about on the news. Eventually, Del and Rodney quickly take the two inflated dolls and dump them in a derelict area. The dolls explode after the Trotter brothers have got clear.

In November 2005 Nally was sentenced to six years' imprisonment for manslaughter. His conviction was quashed in October 2006 and, after a retrial in December 2006, he was found not guilty of manslaughter.\n\nThe Central Criminal Court decided to hear the Nally case in Castlebar, making it the first murder trial in Mayo for almost a century; the jury was chosen from a pool of more than 200 locals. Travellers' support groups criticised the bias because of the jury's composition, arguing that the murder trial should have been afforded a more independent and objective forum. A member of the Law Reform Commission concurred that there was strong case to have such trials take place in Dublin.\n\nWard was a 43-year-old traveller with approximately 80 convictions from 38 separate court appearances and had convictions for burglary, larceny and assault. John \"Frog\" Ward had twice been committed to hospital for psychiatric treatment. In 1999, he threatened a barman with a Stanley knife Ward attacked a car with a slash hook while a woman and two children were inside. Ward had threatened Gardaí in an incident in May 2002 and with a slash, in April 2002. At the time of his death he was facing charges of attacking Gardaí with a slash hook. The court heard that a post-mortem examination and toxicology tests on Mr Ward's body found traces of cannabis, opiates and tranquillisers. It was also emphasised that Mr Ward had been receiving hospital treatment and was on medication for a condition. The \"Prime Time Special\" (RTÉ flagship current affairs programme) brought forward new evidence showing that John Ward had a long criminal record dating back over 30 years and revealed that four bench warrants for John Ward's arrest were outstanding at the time of his death.\n\nTom Ward, the chief witness for the prosecution was himself serving an eleven-month sentence at the time of the trial, for possessing a knife and for theft.\n\nAnother son, John Ward Jr. served an eleven-month sentence handed down in March for a spate of motoring and theft and fraud offences. He pleaded guilty before that court in May to an assault charge. A medical report handed into court at the time stated that the victim had received three stab wounds in the attack.\n\nDuring the first trial, the court heard that Nally had become increasingly agitated and worried that his property would be targeted by local thieves as a number of farms in the area had recently been burgled. His own home had been broken into in 2003 and a chainsaw stolen from one of his sheds in February 2004. Other items had disappeared from around his house and farm. This caused him to be unable to sleep properly. Following the break-in in February 2004 he had kept a gun in a garage and had started to keep registration numbers of strange cars travelling through the district. Friends and neighbours noted Nally had become preoccupied with looking after his farm and terrified that the robbers would return. He told the jury he was at the end of his tether and, according to counsel, was \"agitated and fearful, even paranoid\" about his safety. \"Did he suddenly, after 60 years, become a murderer?\" asked Brendan Grehan, Nally's lawyer, describing his client as a law-abiding member of his community who acted in self-defence.\n\nNally alleged he had met John \"Frog\" Ward previously when Ward had called to his house two weeks before 14 October and had enquired if it would be a good day for fishing. Ward, said Nally, had no fishing tackle with him and this led him to be suspicious of Ward. He did not like the look of him.\n\nUnder cross-examination, Tom Ward denied a suggestion that his father was a bare knuckle boxer, and he said he had no knowledge of a suggestion his father had threatened a Garda with a slashhook. Tom Ward said that on the evening of 13 October 2004 he had bought the car he and his father had travelled in to Pádraig Nally's house the following day. He said he had bought it from other travellers, but he declined to give the court any names. Pádraig Nally's barrister had earlier stated a car bearing a similar description had previously been seen in the vicinity of Cross a short distance from where a chainsaw was reported stolen.\n\nAccording to Marie Cassidy, the state pathologist, John Ward, a Galway traveller, was shot twice on 14 October 2004. The first shot injured John Ward in the hand and hip. The second shot was fired from above and John Ward was in a crouched position at the time. The person who shot him was standing over him and the shot was fired at close range. Nally said in evidence he was afraid Ward would kill him, which was why he fired the second shot (to frighten him [Ward]).\n\nThe Defense argued provocation, as Nally could have reasonably assumed John Ward had been responsible for the theft of the chainsaw and perhaps the numerous other thefts since, as Mr. Nally recognised the vehicle outside his home on 14 October as that bearing the description of the one seen in the vicinity of his home the day his chainsaw was stolen (in 2003). The provocation was, seemingly, the fact that Nally's house had been burgled some time previously, that Ward had called to his house some weeks previously and had acted suspiciously and that Ward was on his premises on 14 October, without authorisation.\n\nNally pleaded not guilty to murder and manslaughter charges. He was acquitted of murder, but convicted of manslaughter. The judge, Mr Justice Paul Carney, refused to allow the jury to consider a full defence argument of self-defence.\n\nSentencing Nally to six years for the manslaughter conviction, Mr Justice Paul Carney said: \"This is undoubtedly the most socially divisive case I have had to try. It is also the most difficult one in which I have had to impose sentence.\". The judge said he would take into consideration Nally's unblemished past, his low risk of re-offending, his willingness to show remorse for his crime and the fact that the prosecution's case was based largely on testaments given by the farmer.\n\nNally was refused leave to appeal by the Central Criminal Court against his conviction and six-year jail sentence.\n\nThe case was then appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal. Nally's lawyers had argued at his appeal that the trial judge had erred in law by not allowing the jury to consider a defence of full self-defence and by not allowing it to find Nally not guilty. He had directed that the jury had to find Nally guilty of murder or guilty of manslaughter, and ruled that an acquittal verdict based on the evidence would be perverse.\n\nIn October 2006, the Court of Criminal Appeal quashed Pádraig Nally's conviction for manslaughter and ordered a retrial. The Court said that the jury should not have been denied the opportunity to return a verdict of not guilty, even if such a verdict may have flown in the face of the evidence.\n\nPádraig Nally's retrial took place in December 2006. Similar evidence was submitted to the court, including evidence of Ward's character and previous convictions and both Nally's and Ward's mental states on the day in question.\n\nThe jury of eight men and four women acquitted Nally of manslaughter and he walked free.\n\nIn 2009, the government announced its plan to introduce a new law of self-defence in 2010 upon recommendation by the Law Reform Commission which would codify the existing common law position on the use of force in defence of property. The Criminal Law (Defence and the Dwelling) Act 2011 was enacted on 19 December 2011.\n\nAlthough widely heralded as \"allowing\" homeowners to exercise reasonable force in defending their home, the Act in fact did nothing to change the legal position as it existed at the time of Nally's trial, other than to place the previous common law jurisprudence on a statutory footing.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "58033444", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58033444", "title": "Decline of Christianity", "text": "Decline of Christianity\n\nThe decline of Christianity is a widespread phenomenon that has affected developed countries and denominations in the post-World War II era, and change into a post-Christian secular multicultural society. Infant baptism has declined in the United Kingdom and United States. Thousands of churches have had to close and mainline Protestant denominations in the United States lost many members of their congregations.\n\nScholars have proposed that Church institutions decline in most industrialized societies, except in cases where religion serves some function in the society beyond merely regulating the relationship between individuals and God.\n\nAdherence to established forms of church-related worship is in rapid decline in Italy and Spain. Church authority on social, moral and ethical issues is not as strong as it has been in the past. In 2017, the \"PBS News Hour\" reported that Sevilles historic cloistered convents were suffering from Christianity's decline in Spain.\n\nIn Quebec, 547 churches have been closed or converted for non-worship based uses. One church was converted into a theater that hosts Led Zeppelin cover bands, Zumba lessons and fetish parties, others have become university reading rooms, luxury condos, or fitness centers. In the 1950s 95% of Quebec's population went to mass—in the present day that number is closer to 5%.No less than 562 churches in Quebec are changing, or one in five.\n\nAn Irish priest has said that the church's authority was most likely undermined by the papal encyclical called \"Humanae Vitae\" that established the Church's opposition to contraception. Fr. Kevin Hegarty has reported that in the diocese of Killala there is only one priest under the age of 40. They haven't had a student for the priesthood since 2013 and have ordained only two priests over the last 17 years. He expects this decline to continue unless the Church alters its positions on female ordination, contraception and sexuality.\n\nAttendance at Anglican churches had started to decline by the Edwardian era. Though missions to converts had increased relative to the Victorian age, these efforts were not as successful as had been hoped. During the early 20th century, membership in mainstream churches and attendance at Sunday schools declined, though scholars note that compiling and explaining the significance of these figures is complex. However, in the years following Queen Victorias death, a pattern emerged that suggested long-term decline, though this wasn't realized until after the First World War.\n\nBritain has experienced a decline in infant baptisms during the post-World War II period. In 2014, Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams said that the UK had become a \"post-Christian country\". That same year only 4.3% of the population participated in a Church of England Christmas service. Justin Welby has said \"there comes a point where the roof really does fall in\".\n\nIn 2017, a report released by St. Mary's University in Twickenham, London that Christianity was declining in Europe. The report's author concluded that Christianity \"as a norm\" was gone for at least the foreseeable future. According to the report 91% of people in the Czech Republic between the ages of 16 to 29 haven't declared a religious affiliation, while in the United Kingdom only 7% identify as Anglican (compared to 6% who identify as Muslim). In at least one dozen out of the 29 European countries surveyed by the researchers, the majority of young adults reported that they were not religious.\n\nNationwide Catholic membership has increased between 2000 and 2017, but the number of Churches has declined by nearly 11%. The ELCA has lost about 30% of its congregation and closed down 12.5% of its churches. The United Methodist church has lost 16.7% of its congregation and 10.2% of its churches. The Presbyterian Church has had the sharpest decline in church membership—between 2000 and 2015 they lost over 40% of their congregation and 15.4% of their churches. Fewer infants are being baptized - nationwide, Catholic baptisms are down by nearly 34% and ELCA baptisms by over 40%. \n\nModerate and liberal denominations in the United States have been closing down churches at a rate 3 or 4 times greater than the number of new churches being consecrated. The closing of churches can be a very difficult process for clergy.\n\nAccording to \"The Christian Century\" a 1% rate of annual closures is quite low relative to other types of institutions. Dave Olson, who headed church planting efforts for the Evangelical Covenant Church in 2008, has said that of the approximately 3,700 churches that close each year, up to half are unsuccessful new churches.\n\nIn 2006, the 119 year old First Lutheran Church of Los Angeles closed down. In August 2007 Rogers Heights Christian Church, which had a peak membership of 600, closed in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The Kinderhook Methodist Church, located near the Mississippi river in a rural part of Illinois, was closed in 2008 after Easter Sunday. An episcopal church in Cincinnati was closed.\n\nIn 2018, the \"Minneapolis Star Tribune\" reported that churches in Minnesota were being closed due to dwindling attendance. Mainline protestant churches have seen the sharpest declines in their congregations. The Catholic Church has closed 81 churches between 2000 and 2017; the Archdiocese closed 21 church in 2010 and has had to merge dozens more. In roughly the same timeframe, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America in Minnesota has lost 200,000 members and closed 150 churches. The United Methodist Church, which is Minnesota's second-largest Protestant denomination, has closed 65 of its churches.\n\nOther denominations like Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormons and Eastern Orthodox have had slight increases in membership between 2003 and 2018.

Originating in the high medieval period (late 11th to early 12th century), the type was frequently used throughout the 13th to 14th centuries. \nContinued use into the 15th and 16th centuries was mostly limited to high nobility, especially royalty, while lower nobility switched to the use of simple heraldic seals.\n\nEarly examples of equestrian seals are known from second half of the 11th century. \nThe oldest example that may be addressed as an \"equestrian seal\" is that of William I of England (c. 1067).\nAmong the oldest extant examples in Germany is the seal of Henry of Laach (c. 1090).\nThe horseman is characterized by the kite shield and a conical helmet, ofen bearing a banner.\nThis type is continued into the mid-12th century, and late examples of kite shields are found into the 1160s.\n\nThe peak of usage comes with the development of the tradition of chivalry in the high medieval period, during c. the last quarter of the 12th century and throughout the 13th century.\nSeals of the 1170s to 1190s show shield shapes transitional between the \"kite\" and the \"heater\" type. Helmet shapes become less conical and more rounded.\nThe horseman is now shown as the prototypical \"knight\" with a heraldic shield. From about the 1230s, the horse is increasingly shown as wearing a heraldic caparison, and the rider as wearing a great helm.\n\nAround the middle of the 13th century, there was a fashion to also represent ladies and ecclesiastics on horseback on their seal, not wearing armour, \nbut, as in the cases of Joan, Countess of Flanders (c. 1240), Maria of Brabant, Duchess of Bavaria (c. 1250) and Adelaide of Burgundy, Duchess of Brabant (c. 1260) practicing falconry.\n\nAfter 1300, equestrian seals were almost exclusively used by the high nobility, by bearers of the rank of duke or higher.\nRepresentations in seals of the 14th century show the nobleman with full heraldic achievements, often carrying a heraldic flag, or with a lance in full jousting armour.\n\nLate forms were used well into the early modern period in France and Germany.\nDepictions of monarchs in full armour, crested helmets, with lances or heraldic flags etc. fell out of use with the end of the joust in the early 17th century.\nFrederick the Great of Prussia used a \"Majestätssiegel\" which depicted him on horseback in 1772 (albeit no longer depicted as a fully armored knight but as a military commander).\n\nThe reverse of the Great Seal of Charles I of England (1627) shows the monarch in full gallop, wearing a fanciful classicist armour, accompanied by a hunting dog.\nThe British monarchs from 1707 onward continued the convention of depicting the seated and crowned monarch on the obverse, and the monarch on horseback on the reverse. This is the case also for the queen regnants (, Queen Victoria, ), who are depicted in sidesaddle.\n\n\n"}

It premiered in cinemas throughout Japan on March 19, 2016. The theme song is by Chise Kanna. The trailer was released on 14 January 2016.\n\nThe film begins in 2006 with Satoru Fujinuma, an aspiring manga writer who has his manga once again rejected by his publisher, forcing him to continue working as a deliveryman to support himself. Satoru has the ability to \"Rewind\", in which he is sent back to a point in the near past to prevent a person around him from enduring a fatal accident. One day, Satoru's mother, Sachiko, stays with him for the weekend. While the two are outside, Sachiko senses a man about to abduct a girl and makes Satoru remember a tragedy that happened 19 years before. Sachiko passes this information to a friend of hers, but when she is alone in Satoru's apartment, she is murdered. Satoru unsuccessfully gives chase to the killer; before he is captured by the police, who accuse him of Sachiko's murder. Satoru's Rewind activates and, to his surprise, he is sent 18 years into the past, back to his elementary school life in Hokkaido.\n\nTrying to adjust to his \"new\" life, Satoru remembers that his Rewind comes around after the murder of Kayo Hinazuki, a classmate of his, by a child serial killer, whose identity is placed to that of Jun Shiratori, even though Satoru does not believe that. He befriends the quiet and friendless Kayo, learning that she lives with an abusive mother, Akemi, and stepfather. With his friends and Sachiko's help, Satoru manages to convince Kayo to attend a double birthday party, as the two children are revealed to have the same birthday. Despite these changes, Kayo is still murdered, and in frustration, Satoru is sent back to the present.\n\nStill evading the police, Satoru seeks refuge in the house of Airi Katagiri, a high school student who works as a fellow part-time deliveryman. Satoru realizes that though Kayo's death still occurred, its details have changed somewhat. Believing that Satoru is wrongly blamed, Airi helps him track down Sachiko's killer. However, this only puts her in danger when her house is burned down in an arson attack, though she still attempts to help Satoru by escaping from hospital, unaware that the police are following her. Meanwhile, Satoru meets with Sachiko's friend whom she contacted earlier, Makoto Sawada, who confirms that Sachiko's killer and the child serial killer are the same person. He reunites with Airi afterward, but this only causes him to be captured by the police. Noticing one of his captors as the killer, Satoru's Rewind activates and he is once again sent to 19 years before.\n\nTo prevent Kayo from being alone, Satoru \"kidnaps\" her by taking her to live away from her mother. He and his friend Kenya Kobayashi first place her in an abandoned van, but when they learn that the van is the child killer's hideout, they move her to live in the Fujinuma residence. Satoru's teacher, Gaku Yashiro, contacts the child abuse prevention center, who take Kayo into custody after enough evidence of Akemi's abuse is revealed. Still convinced that he needs to prevent more murders from happening, Satoru watches over another quiet classmate, Misato Yanagihara, during an ice hockey competition, but she quickly leaves, while Satoru is given a ride home by Yashiro. Recounting the evidence, Satoru eventually realizes that Yashiro is the killer and has deliberately placed Misato as a decoy. To prevent Satoru from interfering again, Yashiro throws him down a river.\n\nSatoru is sent back to 2006, this time to a timeline where both Sachiko and Kayo, who is now pregnant, are alive, where he is no longer estranged from his childhood friends, and where his manga is successfully published; at the same time, however, Airi does not recognize him, as he does not work as a deliveryman in the new timeline. The lawyer Kenya helps him track down Yashiro, who now works as a councilman. Having a face-to-face meeting, Yashiro tells Satoru his demented motive of killing: he kills to prevent the children from having a bleak future. Just when he is about to commit suicide, Satoru stops him, causing himself to get mortally wounded instead, while Yashiro is arrested.\n\nTen years later, Sachiko holds a decennial anniversary of Satoru's death, attended by Kayo, her daughter, Kenya, and the others, while Airi, now a photographer, finishes reading Satoru's manga, \"Boku Dake ga Inai Machi\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "528757", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=528757", "title": "Eton field game", "text": "Eton field game\n\nThe Field Game is one of two codes of football devised and played at Eton College. The other is the Eton Wall Game. The game is like football in some ways – the ball is round, but one size smaller than a standard football, and may not be handled – but the off-side rules – known as 'sneaking' – are more in keeping with rugby. There is also a small scrum or \"Bully\" of either six or seven a side. Goals can be scored much as in soccer, although there is no goalkeeper. But a team gains more points for scoring a 'rouge'. To score a rouge a player must kick the ball so that it deflects off one of the opposing players, or achieve a charge-down, and then goes beyond the opposition's end of the pitch. The ball is then 'rougeable' and must be touched – although not necessarily to the ground – by an attacking player to complete the rouge for five points. Rouges are similar to tries in that the scoring team then attempts to convert them for two points.\n\nIt is the only game at Eton that virtually every boy plays, at least for his first three years in the school, and it occupies prime position in the games programme throughout the Lent Half.\n\nIn 1815 Eton College documented its football rules, the first football code to be written down in Britain. In the modern era, referees are first advocated in English public school football games, notably Eton football in 1845.\n\nThe positions in the field game are divided into two main groups: The \"Bully\" and the \"Behinds\". \n\nBully\n\nThe \"Bully\" is most aptly compared to the forwards in the game of rugby and consists of, 3 \"Corners\", 2 \"Sideposts\", 1 \"Post\", 1 \"Bup\" and the \"Fly\".\n\nBehinds\n\nThe 'behinds' are a group of players made up of two 'Shorts' and a 'Long'. The job of the Shorts is to kick the ball over the Bully, and allow players of their own side to run onto the ball, and hopefully to either score a goal or rouge. The opposing Shorts are trying to do the same thing, and so a kicking war often develops between the two teams of Shorts. This can be advantageous for a team with a fitter bully, as it gives them an opportunity to create an off-side \"Sneaking\", and then win a kick.\nThe Long essentially remains in the goal-mouth, and his job is to kick back any ball which goes over the Shorts, or to defend the goal. He is not like a goalkeeper in football, however, as he cannot use his hands to prevent a goal.\n\nWhen a foul occurs, there are two main ways of restarting the game. One way is a bully, with the non-offending team having \"Heads\". Alternatively, for more serious offences, a kick can be given, which is similar to a free-kick in football.\n\nThere are two main ways of gaining points in the Field Game, either a 'rouge' or a Goal.\n\nGoals\n\nThere is a goal at each end of the pitch. The goals are smaller than in soccer but no player is allowed to use their hands to touch the ball. If a player kicks the ball into the opponent's goal his team scores 3 points.\n\nRougeables\n\nIf the ball comes from a defender and goes behind the infinite line created by extending their goal line, it is rougeable. The ball is also rougeable when a defender kicks it so that it rebounds off an attacker over the goal line, in such a case where, in the opinion of the referee, the attacker makes no deliberate attempt to play the ball over the line. A \"contact\" rougeable may also be created by an attacker if he plays the ball over the infinite line from close range while in contact (other than via the arm below the elbow) with a defender.\n\nWhen a ball is rougeable players from both teams race to reach it first.\n\nIf an attacker reaches it first their team scores a 'rouge', worth five points and also attempts a conversion (see below).\n\nIf a defender reaches it first the attacking team has a choice of 'point or bully': they can choose either to be awarded a single point or to form a bully (like a scrum), close to the opponent's end of the pitch. If they drive the ball over the end of the pitch they score a 'bully rouge' (5 points) and as before can convert it.\n\nConversions\n\nIn a conversion the attackers move the ball down tramlines at the end of the pitch from the side towards the goal. The attacker has to keep the ball moving and avoid it leaving the tramlines. They try either to score a goal or to hit the ball off a defender to score a rouge.\n\nThe conversion in its current form was introduced by rule changes in 2002. It replaced the \"ram\", in which a column of four players from the attacking side lifted their feet to the sound of \"left up right up left up right up, one two three..\", then, to the shout of \"ram\", charged a defensive goalpost scrum from a range of 2.5 yards with the aim of forcing the ball over the line between the posts.\n\n"}

The original flag was designed by playwright Alwin Bully in early 1978 as the country prepared for independence.\n\nThe flag, adopted in 1978, features the national bird emblem, the sisserou parrot, which also appears on the coat of arms granted on 21 July 1961. This parrot, endemic to Dominica, is an endangered species with a population of only 250–350 individuals. \n\nThe green field represents the lush vegetation of the island. The cross represents the Trinity and Christianity, with its three colours symbolising the natives, the fertile soil, and the pure water. The 10 green five-pointed stars stand for the country's 10 parishes: (St Andrew, St David, St George, St John, St Joseph, St Luke, St Mark, St Patrick, St Paul, and St Peter), while the red disc stands for justice.\n\nThe sisserou parrot is sometimes coloured either blue or purple (the parrot's actual colour). The use of purple makes the flag of Dominica one of only two flags of sovereign states (alongside the flag of Nicaragua) to contain the colour.\n\nThe flag of Dominica, along with other national symbols, was the focus of a government-sponsored \"Emblems Week\" in 2016. An initiative of the independence committee, Emblems Week is aimed at reflecting on the meaning of the national emblems, and promoting their use among members of the general public and particularly among the country's schools. \n\n"}

A positive geoglyph is formed by the arrangement and alignment of materials on the ground in a manner akin to petroforms, while a negative geoglyph is formed by removing patinated clasts to expose unpatinated ground in a manner akin to petroglyphs.\n\nA variation of the geoglyph, in the form of three-dimensional postive geoglyph, formed by seeding vegetation in a predetermined shape that typically only becomes visible years after the initial planting or seeding, has been named a arborglyph.\n\nPerhaps the most famous geoglyphs are the Nazca lines in Peru. The cultural significance of these geoglyphs for their creators remains unclear, despite many hypotheses. The \"Works of the Old Men\" in Arabia, \"stone-built structures that are far more numerous than (the) Nazca Lines, far more extensive in the area that they cover, and far older,\" have been described as geoglyphs by Amelia Sparavigna, a physics professor at Politecnico di Torino in Italy. The use of this term to describe these features is probably inaccurate, as recent research has shown that most were not constructed primarily as art, but were rather built to serve a range of purposes including burial sites and funerary customs, aiding in the trapping of migratory animals, and as cleared areas for camps, houses and animal enclosures.\nSince the 1970s, numerous geoglyphs have been discovered on deforested land in the Amazon rainforest, Brazil, leading to claims about Pre-Columbian civilizations. Ondemar Dias is accredited with first discovering the geoglyphs in 1977 and Alceu Ranzi with furthering their discovery after flying over Acre.\n\nOther areas with geoglyphs include Megaliths in the Urals, South Australia (Marree Man, which is not ancient, but rather a modern work of art, with mysterious origins), Western Australia and parts of the Great Basin Desert in the southwestern United States. Hill figures, turf mazes and the stone-lined labyrinths of Scandinavia, Iceland, Lappland and the former Soviet Union are types of geoglyphs.\n\nMore than 50 geoglyphs are found in Kazakhstan.\n\nIn the UK are various equine and humanoid figures cut into chalk hillsides. Examples include Uffington White Horse, Westbury White Horse, Cherhill White Horse, Cerne Abbas Giant, and the Long Man of Wilmington.\n\nNot all geoglyphs are ancient. The Land Art movement created many new geoglyphs as well as other structures; perhaps the most famous example is \"Spiral Jetty\" by Robert Smithson. Many towns and cities in the Western United States use hillside letters (also known as \"mountain monograms\") on the hills above their locations. Contemporary Australian sculptor Andrew Rogers has created geoglyphs around the world called \"The Rhythms of Life\". You Yangs National Park is the home of a geoglyph constructed by Rogers in recognition of the indigenous people of the area. It depicts Bunjil, a mythical creature in the culture of the local Wautharong Aboriginal people.\n\nGeoglyphic texts and images are common in Central and Inner Asia but there has been little systematic study of their origins and spread.\n\nIn 2008–2009 Alfie Dennen created Britglyph, a locative art focused Geoglyph created by having participants across the United Kingdom leave rocks at highly specific locations and uploading media created at each location. When taken together and viewed on the main project website an image of a watch and chain inspired by John Harrison's marine chronometer H5 was created.\n\nPeople have used the Strava mobile app to create Strava art, virtual geoglyphs.\n\n\n"}

References for each definition are included. Terminology relates primarily to invasion biology terms with some ecology terms included to clarify language and phrases on linked pages.\n\nDefinitions of \"invasive non-indigenous species have been inconsistent\", which has led to confusion both in literature and in popular publications (Williams and Meffe 2005). Also, many scientists and managers feel that there is no firm definition of non-indigenous species, native species, exotic species, \"and so on, and ecologists do not use the terms consistently.\" (Shrader-Frechette 2001) Another question asked is whether current language is likely to promote \"effective and appropriate action\" towards invasive species through cohesive language (Larson 2005). Biologists today spend more time and effort on invasive species work because of the rapid spread, economic cost, and effects on ecological systems, so the importance of effective communication about invasive species is clear. (Larson 2005)\n\nControversy in invasion biology terms exists because of past usage and because of preferences for certain terms. Even for biologists, defining a species as native may be far from being a straightforward matter of biological classification based on the location or the discipline a biologist is working in (Helmreich 2005). Questions often arise as to what exactly makes a species native as opposed to non-native, because some non-native species have no known negative effects (Woods and Moriarty 2001). Natural biological invasions, generally considered range expansions, and introductions involving human activities are important and could be considered a normal ecological process (Vermeij 2005). Non-native and native species may be sometimes considered invasive, and these invasions often follow human-induced landscape changes, with subsequent damage to existing landscapes a value judgment (Foster and Sandberg 2004). As a result, many important terms relevant to invasion biology, such as invasive, weed, or transient, include qualities that are \"open to subjective interpretation\" (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004). Sometimes one species can have both beneficial and detrimental effects, such as the Mosquito fish (\"Gambusia affinis\"), which has been widely introduced because of its suppression of larval mosquitoes, although it also has negative impacts on native species of insects, fish and amphibians (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004).\n\nThe large number and current complexity of terms makes interpretation of some of the invasion biology literature challenging and intimidating. Exotic, alien, transplanted, introduced, non-indigenous, and invasive are all words that have been used to describe plants and animals that have been moved beyond their native ranges by humans (Williams and Meffe 2005), along with other terms such as foreign, injurious, aquatic nuisance, pest, non-native, all with a particular implication. Even the use of what seem to be simple, basic terms to articulate ecological concepts \"can confuse ideological debates and undermine management efforts\" (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004). Attempts to redefine commonly used terms in invasion biology have been difficult because many authors and biologists are particular to a favorite definition (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004). Also, the status and identification of any species as an invader, a weed, or an exotic are \"conditioned by cultural and political circumstances.\" (Robbins 2004)\n\nWhere words in a sentence are also defined elsewhere in this article, they appear in italics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12334", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12334", "title": "God Save the Queen", "text": "God Save the Queen\n\n\"God Save the Queen\" (alternatively \"God Save the King\", depending on the gender of the reigning monarch) is the national or royal anthem in a number of Commonwealth realms, their territories, and the British Crown dependencies. The author of the tune is unknown, and it may originate in plainchant; but an attribution to the composer John Bull is sometimes made.\n\n\"God Save the Queen\" is the national anthem of the United Kingdom and one of two national anthems used by New Zealand since 1977, as well as for several of the UK's territories that have their own additional local anthem. It is also the royal anthem – played specifically in the presence of the monarch – of all the aforementioned countries, as well as Australia (since 1984), Canada (since 1980), Barbados and Tuvalu. In countries not previously part of the British Empire, the tune of \"God Save the Queen\" has provided the basis for various patriotic songs, though still generally connected with royal ceremony. The melody continues to be used for the national anthem of Liechtenstein, \"Oben am jungen Rhein\", and the royal anthem of Norway, \"Kongesangen\". In the United States, the melody is used for the patriotic song \"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\".\n\nBeyond its first verse, which is consistent, \"God Save the Queen/King\" has many historic and extant versions. Since its first publication, different verses have been added and taken away and, even today, different publications include various selections of verses in various orders. In general, only one verse is sung. Sometimes two verses are sung, and on rare occasions, three.\n\nThe sovereign and her or his spouse are saluted with the entire composition, while other members of the Royal Family who are entitled to royal salute (such as the Prince of Wales, Duke of Cambridge and Duke of Sussex along with their spouses) receive just the first six bars. The first six bars also form all or part of the Vice Regal Salute in some Commonwealth realms outside the UK (e.g., in Canada, governors general and lieutenant governors at official events are saluted with the first six bars of \"God Save the Queen\" followed by the first four and last four bars of \"O Canada\"), as well as the salute given to governors of British overseas territories.\n\nIn \"The Oxford Companion to Music\", Percy Scholes points out the similarities to an early plainsong melody, although the rhythm is very distinctly that of a galliard, and he gives examples of several such dance tunes that bear a striking resemblance to \"God Save the King/Queen\". Scholes quotes a keyboard piece by John Bull (1619) which has some similarities to the modern tune, depending on the placing of accidentals which at that time were unwritten in certain cases and left to the discretion of the player (see \"musica ficta\"). He also points to several pieces by Henry Purcell, one of which includes the opening notes of the modern tune, setting the words \"God Save the King\". Nineteenth-century scholars and commentators mention the widespread belief that an old Scots carol, \"Remember O Thou Man\" was the source of the tune.\n\nThe first published version of what is almost the present tune appeared in 1744 in \"Thesaurus Musicus\". The 1744 version of the song was popularised in Scotland and England the following year, with the landing of Charles Edward Stuart and was published in \"The Gentleman's Magazine\" (see illustration above). This manuscript has the tune depart from that which is used today at several points, one as early as the first bar, but is otherwise clearly a strong relative of the contemporary anthem. It was recorded as being sung in London theatres in 1745, with, for example, Thomas Arne writing a setting of the tune for the Drury Lane Theatre.\n\nScholes' analysis includes mention of \"untenable\" and \"doubtful\" claims, as well as \"an American misattribution\". Some of these are:\n\nScholes recommends the attribution \"traditional\" or \"traditional; earliest known version by John Bull (1562–1628)\". The \"English Hymnal\" (musical editor Ralph Vaughan Williams) gives no attribution, stating merely \"17th or 18th cent.\"\n\n<poem>God save great George our king\nGod save our noble king,\nGod save the king!\nSend him victorious\nHappy and glorious\nLong to reign over us\nGod save the king!</poem>\n\n\"God Save the Queen\" is the national anthem of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Like many aspects of British constitutional life, its official status derives from custom and use, not from Royal Proclamation or Act of Parliament. In general, only one or two verses are sung, but on rare occasions, three. The variation in the UK of the lyrics to \"God Save the Queen\" is the oldest amongst those currently used, and forms the basis on which all other versions used throughout the Commonwealth are formed; though, again, the words have varied throughout these years.\n\nEngland has no official national anthem of its own; \"God Save the Queen\" is treated as the English national anthem when England is represented at sporting events (though there are some exceptions to this rule, such as cricket where \"Jerusalem\" is used). There is a movement to establish an English national anthem, with Blake and Parry's \"Jerusalem\" and Elgar's \"Land of Hope and Glory\" among the top contenders. Scotland has its own national song and Wales has its own national anthem for political and national events and for use at international football, rugby union and other sports in which those nations compete independently. On all occasions Wales' national anthem is \"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau\" (Land of my Fathers). Scotland has no single anthem; \"Scotland the Brave\" was traditionally used until the 1990s, when \"Flower of Scotland\" was adopted. In Northern Ireland, \"God Save the Queen\" is still used as the official anthem.\n\nThe phrase \"No surrender\" is occasionally sung in the bridge before \"Send her victorious\" by England football fans at matches. The phrase \"no surrender\" is also associated with Combat 18, a white supremacist group. The phrase is also associated with Ulster loyalism and can sometimes be heard at the same point before Northern Ireland football matches.\n\nSince 2003, \"God Save the Queen\", considered an all inclusive Anthem for Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as well as other countries within the Commonwealth, has been dropped from the Commonwealth Games. Northern Irish athletes receive their gold medals to the tune of the \"Londonderry Air\", popularly known as \"Danny Boy\". In 2006, English winners heard Elgar's Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1, usually known as \"Land of Hope and Glory\", but after a poll conducted by the Commonwealth Games Council for England prior to the 2010 Games, \"Jerusalem\" was adopted as England's new Commonwealth Games anthem. In sports in which the UK competes as one nation, most notably as Great Britain at the Olympics, \"God Save the Queen\" is used to represent anyone or any team that comes from the United Kingdom.\n\nThe phrase \"God Save the King\" is much older than the song, appearing, for instance, several times in the King James Bible. A text based on the 1st Book of Kings Chapter 1: verses 38–40, \"...And all the people rejoic'd, and said: God save the King! Long live the King! May the King live for ever, Amen\", has been sung at every coronation since that of King Edgar in 973. Scholes says that as early as 1545 \"God Save the King\" was a watchword of the Royal Navy, with the response being \"Long to reign over us\". He also notes that the prayer read in churches on anniversaries of the Gunpowder Plot includes words which might have formed part of the basis for the second verse \"Scatter our enemies...assuage their malice and confound their devices\".\n\nIn 1745, \"The Gentleman's Magazine\" published \"God save our lord the king: A new song set for two voices\", describing it \"As sung at both Playhouses\" (the Theatres Royal at Drury Lane and Covent Garden). Traditionally, the first performance was thought to have been in 1745, when it was sung in support of King George II, after his defeat at the Battle of Prestonpans by the army of Charles Edward Stuart, son of James Francis Edward Stuart, the Jacobite claimant to the British throne.\n\nIt is sometimes claimed that, ironically, the song was originally sung in support of the Jacobite cause: the word \"send\" in the line \"Send him victorious\" could imply that the king was absent. However, the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" cites examples of \"[God] send (a person) safe, victorious, etc.\" meaning \"God grant that he may be safe, etc.\". There are also examples of early eighteenth century Jacobean drinking glasses which are inscribed with a version of the words and were apparently intended for drinking the health of King James II and VII.\n\nScholes acknowledges these possibilities but argues that the same words were probably being used by both Jacobite and Hanoverian supporters and directed at their respective kings.\n\nIn 1902, the musician William Hayman Cummings, quoting mid-18th century correspondence between Charles Burney and Sir Joseph Banks, proposed that the words were based on a Latin verse composed for King James II at the Chapel Royal.\n\nThere is no definitive version of the lyrics. However, the version consisting of the three verses reproduced in the box on the right hand side has the best claim to be regarded as the \"standard\" British version, appearing not only in the 1745 \"Gentleman's Magazine\", but also in publications such as \"The Book of English Songs: From the Sixteenth to the Nineteenth Century\" (1851), \"National Hymns: How They Are Written and How They Are Not Written\" (1861), \"Household Book of Poetry\" (1882), and \"Hymns Ancient and Modern, Revised Version\" (1982).\n\nThe same version with verse two omitted appears in publications including \"Scouting for Boys\" (1908), and on the British Monarchy website. At the Queen's Golden Jubilee Party at the Palace concert, Prince Charles referred in his speech to the \"politically incorrect second verse\" of the National Anthem.\n\nAccording to Alan Michie's \"Rule, Britannia\", which was published in 1952, after the death of King George VI but before the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, when the first General Assembly of the United Nations was held in London in January 1946 the King, in honour of the occasion, \"ordered the belligerent imperious second stanza of 'God Save the King' to be rewritten to bring it more into the spirit of the brotherhood of nations.\"\n\nIn the UK, the first verse is the only verse typically sung, even at official occasions, although the third verse is sung in addition on rare occasions such as during the opening ceremonies of the 2012 Summer Olympics and 2012 Summer Paralympics, and usually at the Last Night of the Proms. At the Closing Ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the fourth verse of the William Hickson alternative lyrics was sung instead of the third verse.\n\nThe standard version of the melody and its key of G major are still those of the originally published version, although the start of the anthem is often signalled by an introductory timpani roll of two bars length. The bass line of the standard version differs little from the second voice part shown in the original, and there is a standard version in four-part harmony for choirs. The first three lines (six bars of music) are soft, ending with a short \"crescendo\" into \"Send her victorious\", and then is another \"crescendo\" at \"over us:\" into the final words \"God save the Queen\".\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century there existed a Military Band version in the higher key of B, because it was easier for brass instruments to play in that key, though it had the disadvantage of being more difficult to sing: however now most Bands play it in the correct key of G.\n\nSince 1953, the anthem is sometimes preceded by a fanfare composed by Gordon Jacob for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nThere have been several attempts to improve the song by rewriting the words. In the nineteenth century there was some lively debate about the national anthem and, even then, verse two was considered to be slightly offensive. Notably, the question arose over the phrase \"scatter her enemies.\" Some thought it placed better emphasis on the respective power of Parliament and the Crown to change \"her\" to \"our\"; others pointed out that the theology was somewhat dubious and substituted \"thine\" instead. Sydney G. R. Coles wrote a completely new version, as did Canon F. K. Harford. In 1836, William Edward Hickson wrote four alternative verses. The first, third, and fourth of these verses are appended to the National Anthem in the English Hymnal (which only includes verses one and three of the original lyrics).\n\nWilliam Hickson's alternative (1836) version includes the following verses, of which the first, third, and fourth have some currency as they are appended to the National Anthem in the English Hymnal. The fourth verse was sung after the traditional first verse at the Queen's Golden Jubilee National Service of Thanksgiving in 2002 and during the raising of the Union Flag during the closing ceremonies of the 2008 Summer Olympics.\nA less militaristic version of the song, titled \"Official peace version, 1919\", was first published in the hymn book \"Songs of Praise\" in 1925. This was \"official\" in the sense that it was approved by the British Privy Council in 1919. However, despite being reproduced in some other hymn books, it is largely unknown today.\nAround 1745, anti-Jacobite sentiment was captured in a verse appended to the song, with a prayer for the success of Field Marshal George Wade's army then assembling at Newcastle. These words attained some short-term use, although they did not appear in the published version in the October 1745 \"Gentleman's Magazine\". This verse was first documented as an occasional addition to the original anthem by Richard Clark in 1822, and was also mentioned in a later article on the song, published by the \"Gentleman's Magazine\" in October 1836. Therein, it is presented as an \"additional verse... though being of temporary application only... stored in the memory of an old friend... who was born in the very year 1745, and was thus the associate of those who heard it first sung\", the lyrics given being:\n\nThe 1836 article and other sources make it clear that this verse was not used soon after 1745, and certainly before the song became accepted as the British national anthem in the 1780s and 1790s. It was included as an integral part of the song in the \"Oxford Book of Eighteenth-Century Verse\" of 1926, although erroneously referencing the \"fourth verse\" to the \"Gentleman's Magazine\" article of 1745.\n\nOn the opposing side, Jacobite beliefs were demonstrated in an alternative verse used during the same period:\n\nIn May 1800, following an attempt to assassinate King George III at London's Drury Lane theatre, playwright Richard Sheridan immediately composed an additional verse, which was sung from the stage the same night:\n\nVarious other attempts were made during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to add verses to commemorate particular royal or national events. For example, according to Fitzroy Maclean, when Jacobite forces bypassed Wade's force and reached Derby, but then retreated and when their garrison at Carlisle Castle surrendered to a second government army led by King George's son, the Duke of Cumberland, another verse was added. Other short-lived verses were notably anti-French, such as the following, quoted in the book \"Handel\" by Edward J. Dent:\nHowever, none of these additional verses survived into the twentieth century. Updated \"full\" versions including additional verses have been published more recently, including the standard three verses, Hickson's fourth verse, Sheridan's verse and the Marshal Wade verse.\n\nA version from 1794 composed by the American republican and French citizen Joel Barlow celebrated the power of the guillotine to liberate:\n\nThe style most commonly heard in official performances was proposed as the \"proper interpretation\" by King George V, who considered himself something of an expert (in view of the number of times he had heard it). An Army Order was duly issued in 1933, which laid down regulations for tempo, dynamics and orchestration. This included instructions such as that the opening \"six bars will be played quietly by the reed band with horns and basses in a single phrase. Cornets and side-drum are to be added at the little scale-passage leading into the second half of the tune, and the full brass enters for the last eight bars\". The official tempo for the opening section is a metronome setting of 60, with the second part played in a broader manner, at a metronome setting of 52. In recent years the prescribed sombre-paced introduction is often played at a faster and livelier tempo.\n\nUntil the latter part of the 20th century, theatre and concert goers were expected to stand while the anthem was played after the conclusion of a show. In cinemas this brought a tendency for audiences to rush out while the end credits played to avoid this formality. (This can be seen in the 1972 \"Dad's Army\" episode \"A Soldier's Farewell\".)\n\nThe anthem continues to be played at some traditional events such as Wimbledon, Royal Variety Performance, the Edinburgh Tattoo, Royal Ascot, Henley Royal Regatta and The Proms as well as at Royal events.\n\nThe anthem was traditionally played at closedown on the BBC, and with the introduction of commercial television to the UK this practice was adopted by some ITV companies (with the notable exception of Granada). BBC Two never played the anthem at closedown, and ITV dropped the practice in the late 1980s, but it continued on BBC One until the final closedown on 8 November 1997 (thereafter BBC One began to simulcast with BBC News after end of programmes). The tradition is carried on, however, by BBC Radio 4, which plays the anthem each night as a transition piece between the end of the Radio 4 broadcasting and the move to BBC World Service. Radio 4 and Radio 2 also play the National Anthem just before the 0700 and 0800 news bulletins on the actual and official birthdays of the Queen and the birthdays of senior members of the Royal Family.\n\nThe UK's national anthem usually prefaces The Queen's Christmas Message (although in 2007 it appeared at the end, taken from a recording of the 1957 television broadcast), and important royal announcements, such as of royal deaths, when it is played in a slower, sombre arrangement.\n\nFrequently, when an anthem is needed for one of the constituent countries of the United Kingdom at an international sporting event, for instance an alternative song is used:\n\n\nIn April 2007 there was an early day motion, number 1319, to the British Parliament to propose that there should be a separate England anthem: \"That this House ... believes that all English sporting associations should adopt an appropriate song that English sportsmen and women, and the English public, would favour when competing as England\". An amendment (EDM 1319A3) was proposed by Evan Harris that the song \"should have a bit more oomph than \"God Save The Queen\" and should also not involve God.\"\n\nFor more information see also:\n\n\"God Save the King/Queen\" was exported around the world via the expansion of the British Empire, serving as each country's national anthem. Throughout the Empire's evolution into the Commonwealth of Nations, the song declined in use in most states which became independent. In New Zealand, it remains one of the official national anthems.\n\nIn Australia, the song has standing through a Royal Proclamation issued by Governor-General Sir Ninian Stephen on 19 April 1984. It declared \"God Save the Queen\" to be the Royal Anthem and that it is to be played when the Australian monarch or a member of the Royal Family is present, though not exclusively in such circumstances. The same proclamation made \"Advance Australia Fair\" the national anthem and the basis for the \"Vice-Regal Salute\" (the first four and last two bars of the anthem). Prior to 1984, \"God Save the Queen\" was the national anthem of Australia. In 1975 former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, dismissed by Governor-General Sir John Kerr, alluded to the anthem in his comment \"Well may we say 'God save the Queen', because nothing will save the Governor-General!\".\n\nBy convention, \"God Save the Queen\" (, \"Dieu Sauve le Roi\" when a King) is the Royal Anthem of Canada. It is sometimes played or sung together with the national anthem, \"O Canada\", at private and public events organised by groups such as the Government of Canada, the Royal Canadian Legion, police services, and loyal groups. The governor general and provincial lieutenant governors are accorded the \"Viceregal Salute\", comprising the first three lines of \"God Save the Queen\", followed by the first and last lines of \"O Canada\".\n\n\"God Save the Queen\" has been sung in Canada since the late 1700s and by the mid 20th century was, along with \"O Canada\", one of the country's two \"de facto\" national anthems, the first and last verses of the standard British version being used. By-laws and practices governing the use of either song during public events in municipalities varied; in Toronto, \"God Save the Queen\" was employed, while in Montreal it was \"O Canada\". Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson in 1964 said one song would have to be chosen as the country's national anthem and, three years later, he advised Governor General Georges Vanier to appoint the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Commons on the National and Royal Anthems. Within two months, on 12 April 1967, the committee presented its conclusion that \"God Save the Queen\", whose music and lyrics were found to be in the public domain, should be designated as the Royal Anthem of Canada and \"O Canada\" as the national anthem, one verse from each, in both official languages, to be adopted by parliament. The group was then charged with establishing official lyrics for each song; for \"God Save the Queen\", the English words were those inherited from the United Kingdom and the French words were taken from those that had been adopted in 1952 for the coronation of Elizabeth II. When the bill pronouncing \"O Canada\" as the national anthem was put through parliament, the joint committee's earlier recommendations regarding \"God Save the Queen\" were not included.\n\nThe Department of National Defence and the Canadian Forces regulates that \"God Save the Queen\" be played as a salute to the monarch and other members of the Canadian Royal Family, though it may also be used as a hymn, or prayer. The words are not to be sung when the song is played as a military royal salute and is abbreviated to the first three lines while arms are being presented. Elizabeth II stipulated that the arrangement in G major by Lieutenant Colonel Basil H. Brown be used in Canada. The authorised version to be played by pipe bands is \"Mallorca\".\n\nThe first verse of \"God Save the Queen\" has been translated into French, as shown below:\n\nThere is a special Canadian verse in English which was once commonly sung in addition to the two standing verses:\n\n\"God Save the Queen\" was the sole official national anthem until 1977 when \"God Defend New Zealand\" was added as a second. \"God Save the Queen\" is now most often only played when the sovereign, governor-general or other member of the Royal Family is present, or on some occasions such as Anzac Day. The Maori version was written by Edward Marsh Williams under the title, E te atua tohingia te kuini\n\nWhen Rhodesia issued its Unilateral Declaration of Independence from the UK on 11 November 1965, it did so while still maintaining loyalty to Queen Elizabeth II as the Rhodesian head of state, despite the non-recognition of the Rhodesian government by the United Kingdom and the United Nations; \"God Save the Queen\" therefore remained the Rhodesian national anthem. This was supposed to demonstrate the continued allegiance of the Rhodesian people to the monarch, but the retention in Rhodesia of a song so associated with the UK while the two countries were at loggerheads regarding its constitutional status caused Rhodesian state occasions to have \"a faintly ironic tone\", in the words of \"The Times\". Nevertheless, \"God Save the Queen\" remained Rhodesia's national anthem until March 1970, when the country formally declared itself a republic. \"Rise, O Voices of Rhodesia\" was adopted in its stead in 1974 and remained in use until the country returned to the UK's control in December 1979. Since the internationally recognised independence of the Republic of Zimbabwe in April 1980, \"God Save the Queen\" has had no official status there.\n\n\"God Save the Queen\" was a co-national anthem of South Africa from 1938 until 1957, when it was formally replaced by \"Die Stem van Suid-Afrika\" as the sole national anthem. The latter served as a sort of \"de facto\" co-national anthem alongside the former until 1938. As South Africa was a Commonwealth realm at the time, \"God Save the Queen\" continued to remain the royal anthem of the country until it became a fully independent state in 1961.\n\n\"God Save the King\" was one of the first songs to successfully be used as a national anthem; only the Dutch \"Het Wilhelmus\" (~1568) is older. (The Spanish \"La Marcha Real\" is older as well, but took longer to become popular. Japan's anthem \"Kimigayo\" has lyrics which are older still, but a more recent melody). Its success prompted a number of other countries to pen similar anthems to help construct a concrete national identity - many of which used the same tune:\n\n\nThe melody is also used as a hymn tune by Christian churches in various countries, including by the United Methodist Church and other denominations. \"Glory to God on High\" is frequently sung to the tune, as is \"Since I Have My Retreat\" in the Protestant Church of Korea, and the Dutch hymn \"Eeuwig en machtig Heer\".\n\n\"The Ren & Stimpy Show\" uses a parody version of the tune for the anthem of the \"Royal Canadian Kilted Yaksmen\".\n\nAbout 140 composers have used the tune in their compositions, including Beethoven, Haydn, Brahms, Clementi, J. C. Bach, Liszt, Britten, Carl Maria von Weber, Niccolò Paganini, Johann Strauss I, and Edward Elgar.\n\nLudwig van Beethoven composed a set of seven piano variations in the key of C major to the theme of \"God Save the King\", catalogued as WoO.78 (1802–1803). He also quotes it in his orchestral work \"Wellington's Victory\".\n\nMuzio Clementi used the theme to \"God Save the King\" in his \"Symphony No. 3 in G major\", often called the \"Great National Symphony\", catalogued as WoO. 34. Clementi paid a high tribute to his adopted homeland (the United Kingdom) where he grew up and stayed most of his lifetime. He based the Symphony (about 1816–1824) on \"God Save the King\", which is hinted at earlier in the work, not least in the second movement, and announced by the trombones in the finale.\n• Symphony No. 3 \"Great National Symphony \" in en sol majeur/G-dur/G major/sol maggiore\n1. Andante sostenuto – Allegro con brio\n2. Andante un poco mosso\n3. Minuetto. Allegretto\n4. Finale. Vivace\n\nJohann Christian Bach composed a set of variations on \"God Save the King\" for the finale to his sixth keyboard concerto (Op. 1) written c. 1763.\n\nJoseph Haydn was impressed by the use of \"God Save the King\" as a national anthem during his visit to London in 1794, and on his return to Austria composed \"Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser\" (\"God Save Emperor Francis\") for the birthday of the last Holy Roman Emperor and Roman-German King, Francis II. It became the anthem of the Austrian Empire after the end of the Holy Roman Empire with revised lyrics, its tune ultimately being used for the German national anthem. The tune of \"God Save the King\" was adopted for the Prussian royal anthem \"Heil Dir im Siegerkranz\".\n\nFranz Liszt wrote a piano paraphrase on the anthem (S.259 in the official catalogue, c. 1841).\n\nJohann Strauss I quoted \"God Save the Queen\" in full at the end of his waltz \"Huldigung der Königin Victoria von Grossbritannien\" (Homage to Queen Victoria of Great Britain) Op. 103, where he also quoted \"Rule, Britannia!\" in full at the beginning of the piece.\n\nSiegfried August Mahlmann in the early 19th century wrote alternate lyrics to adapt the hymn for the Kingdom of Saxony, as \"Gott segne Sachsenland\" (\"God Bless Saxony\").\n\nHeinrich Marschner used the anthem in his \"Grande Ouverture solenne\", op.78 (1842).\n\nGaetano Donizetti used this anthem in his opera \"Roberto Devereux\".\n\nJoachim Raff used this anthem in his Jubelouverture, Opus 103 (1864) dedicated to Adolf, Herzog von Nassau, on the 25th anniversary of his reign.\n\nGioachino Rossini used this anthem in the last scene of his \"Il viaggio a Reims\", when all the characters, coming from many different European countries, sing a song which recalls their own homeland. Lord Sidney, bass, sings \"Della real pianta\" on the notes of \"God Save the King\". Samuel Ramey used to interpolate a spectacular virtuoso cadenza at the end of the song.\n\nFernando Sor used the anthem in his 12 Studies, Op. 6: No. 10 in C Major in the section marked 'Maestoso.'\n\nArthur Sullivan quotes the anthem at the end of his ballet \"Victoria and Merrie England\".\n\nClaude Debussy opens with a brief introduction of \"God Save the King\" in one of his Preludes, \"Hommage à S. Pickwick Esq. P.P.M.P.C.\". The piece draws its inspiration from the main character of the Charles Dickens novel \"The Pickwick Papers\".\n\nNiccolò Paganini wrote a set of highly virtuosic variations on \"God Save the King\" as his Opus 9.\n\nMax Reger wrote \"Variations and Fugue on 'Heil dir im Siegerkranz' (God Save the King)\" for organ in 1901 after the death of Queen Victoria. It does not have an opus number.\n\nA week before the Coronation Ode was due to be premiered at the June 1902 \"Coronation Gala Concert\" at Covent Garden (it was cancelled, owing to the King's illness), Sir Edward Elgar introduced an arrangement of \"Land of Hope and Glory\" as a solo song performed by Clara Butt at a \"Coronation Concert\" at the Albert Hall. Novello seized upon the prevailing patriotism and requested that Elgar arrange the National Anthem as an appropriate opening for a concert performed in front of the Court and numerous British and foreign dignitaries. This version for orchestra and chorus, which is enlivened by use of \"a cappella\" and marcato effects, was also performed at the opening of the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley on St. George’s Day, 1924, and recorded under the composer's Baton in 1928, with the LSO and the Philharmonic Choir. Elgar also used the first verse of the Anthem as the climax of a short \"Civic Procession and Anthem\", written to accompany the mayoral procession at the opening of the Hereford Music Festival on 4 September 1927. This premiere performance was recorded, and is today available on CD; the score was lost following the festival, and Elgar resorted to reconstructing it by ear from the recording.\n\nCarl Maria von Weber uses the \"God Save the King\" theme at the end of his \"Jubel Overture\".\n\nGiuseppe Verdi included \"God Save the Queen\" in his \"Inno delle nazioni\" (Hymn of the Nations), composed for the London 1862 International Exhibition.\n\nBenjamin Britten arranged \"God Save the Queen\" in 1961 for the Leeds Festival. This version has been programmed several times at the Last Night of the Proms.\n\nCharles Ives wrote \"Variations on \"America\"\" for organ in 1891 at age seventeen. It included a polytonal section in three simultaneous keys, though this was omitted from performances at his father's request, because \"it made the boys laugh out loud\". Ives was fond of the rapid pedal line in the final variation, which he said was \"almost as much fun as playing baseball\". The piece was not published until 1949; the final version includes an introduction, seven variations and a polytonal interlude. The piece was adapted for orchestra in 1963 by William Schuman. This version became popular during the bicentennial celebrations, and is often heard at pops concerts.\n\nMuthuswami Dikshitar (1776–1835), one of the musical trinity in South Indian classical (Carnatic) music composed some Sanskrit pieces set to Western tunes. These are in the raga Sankarabharanam and are referred to as \"nottu swaras\". Among these, the composition \"Santatam Pahimam Sangita Shyamale\" is set to the tune of \"God Save the Queen\".\n\nSigismond Thalberg (1812-1871), Swiss composer and one of the most famous virtuoso pianists of the 19th century, wrote a fantasia on \"God Save the Queen\".\n\nJohan Nepomuk Hummel (1778-1837) wrote the \"Variations from God Save the King in D major\", op. 10 and quoted the tune briefly in his \"Freudenfest-Ouverture in D major\" S 148\n\nAdrien-François Servais (1807–66) and Joseph Ghys (1801–48) wrote \"Variations brillantes et concertantes sur l'air \"God Save the King\"\", op. 38, for violin and cello and performed it in London and St Petersburg.\n\nGeorges Onslow (1784-1853) used the tune in his String Quartet No. 7 in G Minor, op.9, second movement.\n\nGordon Jacob wrote a choral arrangement of God Save the Queen with a trumpet fanfare introduction, for the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953.\n\nThe British rock band Family sampled \"God Save the Queen\" at the end of their 1968 debut album, \"Music in a Doll's House\", following the final track, \"3 x Time\".\n\nThe Beatles performed an impromptu version of \"God Save the Queen\" during their 30 January 1969 rooftop concert, atop the Apple building. They had also whistled the melody of the song on their first fan club Christmas record in 1963.\n\nJimi Hendrix of The Jimi Hendrix Experience played an impromptu version of \"God Save the Queen\" to open his set at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970. Just before walking onto the stage, he can be seen (on the DVD) and heard to ask \"How does it go again?\" in reference to said UK national anthem. He may have been able to simply hear it mimicked by voice and then perform it, though the same melody was (and is) widely known in the United States to the lyrics \"My country, 'tis of thee\". Hendrix gave the same sort of distortion and improvisation of \"God Save the Queen\", as he had done with \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at the Woodstock Festival, 1969.\n\nGentle Giant performed a version—titled \"The Queen\"—on their 1970 eponymous debut album.\n\nThe rock band Queen recorded an instrumental version of \"God Save the Queen\" on their 1975 album \"A Night at the Opera\". It was arranged by guitarist Brian May and features his distinctive layers of overdubbed electric guitars. A tape of this version would be played at the end of almost every concert, with Freddie Mercury walking around the stage wearing a crown and a cloak on their Magic Tour in 1986. The song was played whilst all the Queen members would take their bows. On 3 June 2002, during the Queen's Golden Jubilee, Brian May performed the anthem on his Red Special electric guitar for Party at the Palace, performing from the roof of Buckingham Palace, and features on the 30th Anniversary DVD edition of \"A Night at the Opera\". \n\nIn 1977, the Sex Pistols recorded a song titled \"God Save the Queen\" in open reference to the National Anthem and the Queen's Silver Jubilee celebrations that year, with the song intending to stand for sympathy for the working class and resentment of the monarchy. They were banned from many venues, censored by mainstream media, and reached number 2 on the official U.K. singles charts and number 1 on the NME chart.\n\nA version of \"God Save the Queen\" by Madness features the melody of the song played on kazoos. It was included on the compilation album \"The Business – the Definitive Singles Collection\".\n\nComposer Steve Ouimette recorded a rock version as downloadable content for the video game \"Guitar Hero 5\".\n\nCanadian rocker Neil Young recorded a rock version of \"God Save the Queen\", merged with \"America (My Country 'Tis of Thee)\", for his 2012 \"Americana\" album with Crazy Horse.\n\nThe title is \"Dog Save the Queen\", from \"T.U.F.F. Puppy\"\n\nIn \"Team Fortress 2\", one of the Sniper's quotes is the same title as the anthem. This is in reference to New Zealand (the Sniper's birthplace) being a former British colony.\n\nIn the movie version of \"V for Vendetta\" during an episode of Gordon Deitrich's show, which sends up Chancellor Adam Suttler.\n\nIn 'The Royal Canadian Kilted Yaksmen' episode of \"Ren & Stimpy\" (the song is the Royal Canadian Kilted Yaksmen anthem.)\n\nThe anthem was the first piece of music played on a computer, and the first computer music to be recorded.\n\nMusical notes were first generated by a computer programmed by Alan Turing at the Computing Machine Laboratory of the University of Manchester in 1948. The first music proper, a performance of the National Anthem was programmed by Christopher Strachey on the Mark II Manchester Electronic Computer at same venue, in 1951. Later that year, short extracts of three pieces, the first being the National Anthem, were recorded there by a BBC outside broadcasting unit: the other pieces being \"Ba Ba Black Sheep, and \"In the Mood\". Researchers at the University of Canterbury, Christchurch restored the acetate master disc in 2016 and the results may be heard on Soundcloud.\n\nThe philosopher and reformer Jeremy Bentham praised \"God Save the King\" in 1796: \"the melody recommending itself by beauty to the most polished ears, and by its simplicity to the rudest ear. A song of this complexion, implanted by the habit of half a century in the mass of popular sentiment, can not be refused a place in the inventory of the national blessings.\" Ludwig van Beethoven wrote \"I have to show the English a little of what a blessing 'God Save the King' is\". Alex Marshall, the British author of \"Republic or Death!: Travels in Search of National Anthems\", called the anthem \"ludicrous\".\n\nThere have been calls within the UK for a new national anthem, whether it be for the United Kingdom itself, Britain and/or England (which all currently use God Save the Queen). There are many reasons people cite for wishing for a new national anthem, such as: from a non-religious standpoint (the majority of people in the UK today identify as not religious), claims of God Save the Queen being long outdated and irrelevant in the 21st century, rejection of odes to promoting war and rejection of praising the monarchy from a republican perspective. A further reason is that England has no anthem of its own for sporting contests and the like, whereas Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales do; Flower of Scotland, Londonderry Air, and Land of My Fathers fill this niche (the former two on an unofficial basis), while England tends to use \"God Save the Queen\" exclusively and also unofficially.\n\n"}

It was originally believed to have belonged to the church in Antioch, a thriving Roman city on the Mediterranean It can now be argued that the items come from a larger collection of silver from the church of Saint Sergios in modern-day Kurin, Syria or that the pieces belonged to a small local church. The final items of the collection were likely interred at the site in the seventh century as the Byzantine Empire subsequently lost this area of Syria to the Persian army. The later conquering by the Muslim Arab army permanently removed the area from Byzantine control.\n\nIt is believed that the Persian and Muslim Arab take-overs were relatively peaceful as historic sites around the area show little to no damage that could be attributed to that time. Though religion began to shift following the change of power and Christian artifacts were increasingly stored away from public viewing, the area did continue to benefit from relative wealth and prosperity, creating many secular works. The real halt to production of silver treasures is thought to have followed a plague throughout the area from 542 to 544. This had a lasting impact on the economic status of the region.\n\nThere is evidence that this accumulation of local wealth in silver objects was common throughout the area leading up to the Persian control and the sixth century plague. Similar treasures have been found at Stuma, Riha, Hama, and Antioch to name a few.\n\nThe objects found in the Kaper Koraon treasure were not originally prestigious shrine gifts but were likely relatively cheap imitations made specifically for a village church. This can be clearly seen from recent investigations into the pieces which have shown high quantities of copper and other metals melted in with the silver to increase malleability and decrease production costs. It is estimated that these items were the collective donations from five local families over a period of at least three decades. Many of the stamps present on the pieces are believed to have been added after production and some note the specific donors of each piece.\n\nThe Kaper Koraon treasure consists of 56 total silver objects including: eight chalices, seven patens, five crosses, one cross revetment, two lamp stands, three lamps, three ewers, one flask, one bowl, one mirror, one box, eleven spoons, one ladle, two strainers, two fans, and four plaques. The other three objects are only partial pieces of broken fragments likely from other plaques. Many of the items are religious in nature including images of the cross and Jesus's disciples. Some are believed to be secular but were stored with the church collection either for safe-keeping on behalf of the owner or stores of wealth for the parish.\n\nMost of the silver pieces shown here still show evidence of hammering either visibly or through careful machine investigation. Due to the limited skill level of local workers and the overworking of malleable metal, many items featured here have stress fractures or chips that were original to the piece. Any repairs visible, such as the re-welding of a handle onto an ewar, are likely original and occurred before the internment of the treasure. Many of the chalices were hammered, welded together, and then lathed to smooth out the seams between the cup and the stem. Some chalices shows signs of wear at these seams and around the top rim due to the method of their construction.\n\nSince their discovery, the items of the Kaper Koraon treasure have dispersed into public and private collections throughout the world including The Walters Art Museum.\n"}

If not a prerequisite for the superhero genre, the origin... is certainly a prominent and popular trope that recurs so frequently as to offer clues to the nature of this narrative tradition. To read stories about destroyed worlds, murdered parents, genetic mutations, and mysterious power-giving wizards is to realize the degree to which the superhero genre is about transformation, about identity, about difference, and about the tension between psychological rigidity and a flexible and fluid sense of human nature. ... When surveying the superhero genre, preliminary questions often turn to the problem of roots.\" The book has a wealth of pertinent bibliographies.\n\nEnglish professors Dr. Alex Romagnoli and Dr. Gian S. Pagnucci, of Indiana University of Pennsylvania, discuss in their book \"Enter the Superheroes: American Values, Culture, and the Canon of Superhero Literature\" \"the nature of superhero origin stories and how the writing of these origin stories helps make superhero narratives a unique literary genre.\" For example, they write, \"Superheroes get very complicated when it comes to their histories, but one part of their stories remains forever constant and important. Even more than 'death' stories, crossovers, event stories, and attire changes, origin stories are the core of superheroes' existences. Origins not only reflect the sociohistorical contexts in which heroes were created, but they also reflect a culture's understanding of what makes superheroes storytelling unique vehicles.\" Thereafter, Romagnoli and Pagnucci go on to explain why the origin story is as important to the audience as to the generations of writers who continue heroic tales.\n\nDr. Randy Duncan (comics scholar and professor of communication, Henderson State University, Arkadelphia, Arkansas) and Dr. Matthew J. Smith (Department of Communication, Wittenberg University, Springfield, Ohio) use the origin story of Spider-Man as an example of how a character can be created by the persistence of a writer who has definite preferences in creating a character's personality, even if the publisher resists. \"It is difficult to discern which is more often told: Spider-Man's origin or the tales told around that origin. All reveal fascinating aspects of a teenage loner fatefully 'bitten by a radioactive spider' to find himself with 'the proportionate strength and agility of an arachnid'.\" Duncan and Smith explain how Stan Lee butted heads with publisher Martin Goodman, who worried about an \"ick factor,\" but Lee prevailed. \"The entire Spider-Man concept resonates with the primary attributes of many genres and traditions,\" the authors say. \"Like a heady puree of [Mary] Shelley's \"Frankenstein\", Bob Kane's Batman, and Franz Kafka's \"Metamorphosis\", Spider-Man's origin invokes gothic and crime fiction motifs like the ostracized genius, doomed loved ones, the misuse or misfiring of science, the gritty noir city, the driven vigilante, and the fateful 'return of the repressed'.\" The authors proceed to investigate these various issues of the origin story.\n\nHeroes\nVillains\n\n\n"}

{"id": "311401", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=311401", "title": "Renaissance art", "text": "Renaissance art\n\nRenaissance art is the painting, sculpture and decorative arts of the period of European history, emerging as a distinct style in Italy in about 1400, in parallel with developments which occurred in philosophy, literature, music, and science. Renaissance art, perceived as the noblest of ancient traditions, took as its foundation the art of Classical antiquity, but transformed that tradition by absorbing recent developments in the art of Northern Europe and by applying contemporary scientific knowledge. Renaissance art, with Renaissance Humanist philosophy, spread throughout Europe, affecting both artists and their patrons with the development of new techniques and new artistic sensibilities. Renaissance art marks the transition of Europe from the medieval period to the Early Modern age.\n\nIn many parts of Europe, Early Renaissance art was created in parallel with Late Medieval art.\nRenaissance art, painting, sculpture, architecture, music, and literature produced during the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries in Europe under the combined influences of an increased awareness of nature, a revival of classical learning, and a more individualistic view of man. Scholars no longer believe that the Renaissance marked an abrupt break with medieval values, as is suggested by the French word renaissance, literally “rebirth.” Rather, historical sources suggest that interest in nature, humanistic learning, and individualism were already present in the late medieval period and became dominant in 15th- and 16th-century Italy concurrently with social and economic changes such as the secularization of daily life, the rise of a rational money-credit economy, and greatly increased social mobility.\nThe influences upon the development of Renaissance men and women in the early 15th century are those that also affected Philosophy, Literature, Architecture, Theology, Science, Government, and other aspects of society. The following list presents a summary, dealt with more fully in the main articles that are cited above.\n\nIn Italy in the late 13th and early 14th centuries, the sculpture of Nicola Pisano and his son Giovanni Pisano, working at Pisa, Siena and Pistoia shows markedly classicising tendencies, probably influenced by the familiarity of these artists with ancient Roman sarcophagi. Their masterpieces are the pulpits of the Baptistery and Cathedral of Pisa. \n\nContemporary with Giovanni Pisano, the Florentine painter Giotto developed a manner of figurative painting that was unprecedentedly naturalistic, three-dimensional, lifelike and classicist, when compared with that of his contemporaries and teacher Cimabue. Giotto, whose greatest work is the cycle of the \"Life of Christ\" at the Arena Chapel in Padua, was seen by the 16th century biographer Giorgio Vasari as \"rescuing and restoring art\" from the \"crude, traditional, Byzantine style\" prevalent in Italy in the 13th century.\n\nThe painters of the Low Countries in this period included Jan van Eyck, his brother Hubert van Eyck, Robert Campin, Hans Memling, Rogier van der Weyden and Hugo van der Goes. Their painting developed partly independently of Early Italian Renaissance painting, and without the influence of a deliberate and conscious striving to revive antiquity. \n\nThe style of painting grew directly out of medieval painting in tempera, on panels and illuminated manuscripts, and other forms such as stained glass; the medium of fresco was less common in northern Europe. The medium used was oil paint, which had long been utilised for painting leather ceremonial shields and accoutrements, because it was flexible and relatively durable. The earliest Netherlandish oil paintings are meticulous and detailed like tempera paintings. The material lent itself to the depiction of tonal variations and texture, so facilitating the observation of nature in great detail. \n\nThe Netherlandish painters did not approach the creation of a picture through a framework of linear perspective and correct proportion. They maintained a medieval view of hierarchical proportion and religious symbolism, while delighting in a realistic treatment of material elements, both natural and man-made. Jan van Eyck, with his brother Hubert, painted \"The Altarpiece of the Mystical Lamb\". It is probable that Antonello da Messina became familiar with Van Eyck's work, while in Naples or Sicily. In 1475, Hugo van der Goes' \"Portinari Altarpiece\" arrived in Florence where it was to have a profound influence on many painters, most immediately Domenico Ghirlandaio who painted an altarpiece imitating its elements.\n\nA very significant Netherlandish painter towards the end of the period was Hieronymus Bosch, who employed the type of fanciful forms that were often utilized to decorate borders and letters in illuminated manuscripts, combining plant and animal forms with architectonic ones. When taken from the context of the illumination and peopled with humans, these forms give Bosch's paintings a surreal quality which have no parallel in the work of any other Renaissance painter. His masterpiece is the triptych \"The Garden of Earthly Delights\".\n\nAlthough both the Pisanos and Giotto had students and followers, the first truly Renaissance artists were not to emerge in Florence until 1401 with the competition to sculpt a set of bronze doors of the Baptistery of Florence Cathedral which drew entries from seven young sculptors including Brunelleschi, Donatello and the winner, Lorenzo Ghiberti. Brunelleschi, most famous as the architect of the dome of Florence Cathedral and the Church of San Lorenzo, created a number of sculptural works, including a lifesized Crucifix in Santa Maria Novella, renowned for its naturalism. His studies of perspective are thought to have influenced the painter Masaccio. Donatello became renowned as the greatest sculptor of the Early Renaissance, his masterpieces being his Humanist and unusually erotic statue of David, one of the icons of the Florentine republic, and his great monument to Gattamelata, the first large equestrian bronze to be created since Roman times.\n\nThe contemporary of Donatello, Masaccio, was the painterly descendant of Giotto and began the Early Renaissance in Italian Painting in 1425, furthering the trend towards solidity of form and naturalism of face and gesture that Giotto had begun a century earlier. From 1425-28, Masaccio completed several panel paintings but is best known for the fresco cycle that he began in the Brancacci Chapel with the older artist Masolino and which had profound influence on later painters, including Michelangelo. Masaccio's developments were carried forward in the paintings of Fra Angelico, particularly in his frescos at the Convent of San Marco in Florence.\n\nThe treatment of the elements of perspective and light in painting was of particular concern to 15th-century Florentine painters. Uccello was so obsessed with trying to achieve an appearance of perspective that, according to Vasari, it disturbed his sleep. His solutions can be seen in his masterpiece set of three paintings, the Battle of San Romano which is believed to have been completed by 1460. Piero della Francesca made systematic and scientific studies of both light and linear perspective, the results of which can be seen in his fresco cycle of \"The History of the True Cross\" in San Francesco, Arezzo.\n\nIn Naples, the painter Antonello da Messina began using oil paints for portraits and religious paintings at a date that preceded other Italian painters, possibly about 1450. He carried this technique north and influenced the painters of Venice. One of the most significant painters of Northern Italy was Andrea Mantegna, who decorated the interior of a room, \"the Camera degli Sposi\" for his patron Ludovico Gonzaga, setting portraits of the family and court into an illusionistic architectural space.\n\nThe end period of the Early Renaissance in Italian art is marked, like its beginning, by a particular commission that drew artists together, this time in cooperation rather than competition. Pope Sixtus IV had rebuilt the Papal Chapel, named the Sistine Chapel in his honour, and commissioned a group of artists, Sandro Botticelli, Pietro Perugino, Domenico Ghirlandaio and Cosimo Rosselli to decorate its wall with fresco cycles depicting \"the Life of Christ\" and \"the Life of Moses\". In the sixteen large paintings, the artists, although each working in his individual style, agreed on principals of format, and utilised the techniques of lighting, linear and atmospheric perspective, anatomy, foreshortening and characterisation that had been carried to a high point in the large Florentine studios of Ghiberti, Verrocchio, Ghirlandaio and Perugino.\n\nThe artists of France, (including duchies such as Burgundy) were often associated with courts, providing illuminated manuscripts and portraits for the nobility as well as devotional paintings and altarpieces. Among the most famous were the Limbourg brothers, Flemish illuminators and creators of the Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry. Jean Fouquet, painter of the royal court, visited Italy in 1437 and reflects the influence of Florentine painters such as Paolo Uccello. Although best known for his portraits such as that of Charles VII of France Fouquet also created illuminations, and is thought to be the inventor of the portrait miniature. There were a number of artists at this date who painted famed altarpieces, that are stylistically quite distinct from both the Italian and the Flemish. These include two enigmatic figures, Enguerrand Quarton to whom is ascribed the \"Pieta of Villeneuve-lès-Avignon\", and Jean Hey, otherwise known as \"the Master of Moulins\" after his most famous work, \"the Moulins Altarpiece\". In these works realism and close observation of the human figure, emotions and lighting are combined with a Medieval formality, which includes gilt backgrounds.\n\nThe \"universal genius\" Leonardo da Vinci was to further perfect the aspects of pictorial art (lighting, linear and atmospheric perspective, anatomy, foreshortening and characterisation) that had preoccupied artists of the Early Renaissance, in a lifetime of studying and meticulously recording his observations of the natural world. His adoption of oil paint as his primary media meant that he could depict light and its effects on the landscape and objects more naturally and with greater dramatic effect than had ever been done before, as demonstrated in the \"Mona Lisa\". His dissection of cadavers carried forward the understanding of skeletal and muscular anatomy, as seen in the unfinished \"St Jerome\". His depiction of human emotion in \"The Last Supper\", completed 1495-1498, set the benchmark for religious painting.\n\nThe art of Leonardo's younger contemporary Michelangelo took a very different direction. Michelangelo, in neither his painting nor his sculpture demonstrates any interest in the observation of any natural object except the human body. He perfected his technique in depicting it, while in his early twenties, by the creation of the enormous marble statue of \"David\" and the group \"the Pieta\", in St Peter's Basilica, Rome. He then set about an exploration of the expressive possibilities of the human anatomy. His commission by Pope Julius II to paint the Sistine Chapel ceiling resulted in the supreme masterpiece of figurative composition, which was to have profound effect on every subsequent generation of European artists. His later work, \"The Last Judgement\", painted on the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel between 1534 and 1541 shows a Mannerist (also called Late Renaissance) style with generally elongated bodies which took over from the High Renaissance style between 1520 and 1530.\n\nStanding alongside Leonardo and Michelangelo as the third great painter of the High Renaissance was the younger Raphael, who in a short life span painted a great number of lifelike and engaging portraits, including those of Pope Julius II and his successor Pope Leo X, and numerous portrayals of the Madonna and Christ Child, including the Sistine Madonna. His death in 1520 at age 37 is considered by many art historians to be the end of the High Renaissance period, although some individual artists continued working in the High Renaissance style for many years thereafter.\n\nIn Northern Italy the High Renaissance is represented by the latter works of Giovanni Bellini, especially religious paintings, which include several large altarpieces of a type known as \"Sacred Conversation\" which show a group of saints around the enthroned Madonna. His contemporary Giorgione, who died at about the age of 32 in 1510, left a small number of enigmatic works, including \"The Tempest\", the subject of which has remained a matter of speculation. The earliest works of Titian date from the era of the High Renaissance, including a massive altarpiece \"The Assumption of the Virgin\" which combines human action and drama with spectacular colour and atmosphere. Titian continued painting in a generally High Renaissance style until near the end of his career in the 1570s, although he increasingly used colour and light over line to define his figures.\n\nGerman Renaissance art falls into the broader category of the Renaissance in Northern Europe, also known as the Northern Renaissance. \nRenaissance influences began to appear in German art in the 15th century, but this trend was not widespread. Gardner's \"Art Through the Ages\" identifies Michael Pacher, a painter and sculptor, as the first German artist whose work begins to show Italian Renaissance influences. According to that source, Pacher's painting, \"St. Wolfgang Forces the Devil to Hold His Prayerbook\" (c.1481), is Late Gothic in style, but also shows the influence of the Italian artist, Mantegna.\nArtisans, such as engravers, became more concerned with aesthetics rather than just perfecting their craft. Germany had master engravers, such as Martin Schongauer, who did metal engravings in the late 1400s. Gardner relates this mastery of the graphic arts to advances in printing which occurred in Germany, and says that metal engraving began to replace the woodcut during the Renaissance. However, some artists, such as Albrecht Dürer, continued to do woodcuts. Both Gardner and Russell describe the fine quality of Dürer's woodcuts, with Russell stating, in \"The World of Dürer\", that Dürer \"elevated them into high works of art.\"\nIn the 1500s, Renaissance art in Germany became more common as, according to Gardner, \"The art of northern Europe during the sixteenth century is characterized by a sudden awareness of the advances made by the Italian Renaissance and by a desire to assimilate this new style as rapidly as possible.\" One of the best known practitioners of German Renaissance art was Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528). Dürer's fascination with classical ideas led him to Italy to study art. Both Gardner and Russell recognized the importance of Durer's contribution to German art in bringing Italian Renaissance styles and ideas to Germany. Russell calls this \"Opening the Gothic windows of German art,\" while Gardner calls it Dürer's \"life mission.\" Importantly, as Gardner points out, Dürer \"was the first northern artist who fully understood the basic aims of the southern Renaissance,\" although his style did not always reflect that. The same source says that Hans Holbein the Younger (1497–1543) successfully assimilated Italian ideas while also keeping \"northern traditions of close realism.\" This is contrasted against Dürer's tendency to work in \"his own native German style\" instead of combining German and Italian styles.\nOther important artists of the German Renaissance were Grünewald, Albrecht Altdorfer, and Lucas Cranach the Elder.\n\nBritain was very late to develop a Renaissance style and most artists of the Tudor court were imported foreigners, usually from the Low countries, including Hans Holbein the Younger, who died in England. One exception was the portrait miniature, which artists including Nicholas Hilliard developed into a distinct genre, well before it became popular in the rest of Europe. Renaissance art in Scotland was similarly dependent on imported artists, and largely restricted to the court.\n\nRenaissance artists painted a wide variety of themes. Religious altarpieces, fresco cycles, and small works for private devotion were very popular. For inspiration, painters in both Italy and northern Europe frequently turned to Jacobus de Voragine's \"Golden Legend\" (1260), a highly influential source book for the lives of saints that had already had a strong influence on Medieval artists. The rebirth of classical antiquity and Renaissance humanism also resulted in many Mythological and history paintings. Ovidian stories, for example, were very popular. Decorative ornament, often used in painted architectural elements, was especially influenced by classical Roman motifs.\n\n\n\n\"Main articles: Early Netherlandish painting for 15th-century artists, Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting for 16th-century artists\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Indeed, almost all our pre-Islamic women's poetry is in this form.

{"id": "118568", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=118568", "title": "Romano-British culture", "text": "Romano-British culture\n\nRomano-British culture is the culture that arose in Britain under the Roman Empire following the Roman conquest in AD 43 and the creation of the province of Britannia. It arose as a fusion of the imported Roman culture with that of the indigenous Britons, a people of Celtic language and custom. It survived the 5th century Roman departure from Britain, eventually finding itself a stronghold in Wales where it was to form the basis of an emerging Welsh culture. Scholars such as Christopher Snyder believe that during the 5th and 6th centuries – approximately from 410 when the Roman legions withdrew, to 597 when St Augustine of Canterbury arrived – southern Britain preserved an active sub-Roman culture that survived the attacks from the Anglo-Saxons and even used a vernacular Latin when writing.\n\nRoman troops, mainly from nearby provinces, invaded the Brythonic Celtic land in AD 43, in what is now part of England, during the reign of Emperor Claudius. Over the next few years the province of Britannia was formed, eventually including the whole of what later became England and Wales and parts of Scotland. Thousands of Roman businessmen and officials and their families settled in Britannia. Roman troops from across the Empire, as far as Spain, Syria, Egypt, and the Germanic provinces of Batavia and Frisia (modern Netherlands, Belgium, and the Rhineland area of Germany), were garrisoned in Roman towns, and many married local Britons. The Roman army and their families and dependents amounted to 125,000 people, out of Britannia's total population of 3.6 million at the end of the fourth century. There were also many migrants of other professions, such as sculptors from Roman Syria and doctors from the Eastern Mediterranean region. This diversified Britannia's cultures and religions, while the populace remained mainly Celtic, with a Roman way of life.\n\nThe bulk of the population was rural; from a total population of 3.6 million at the end of the fourth century, the urban population was about 240,000 people, with the capital city of Londinium having about 60,000 people. Londonium was an ethnically diverse city with inhabitants from across the Roman Empire, including natives of Britannia, continental Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. There was also cultural diversity in other Roman-British towns, which were sustained by considerable migration, both within Britannia and from other Roman territories, including North Africa, Syria, the Eastern Mediterranean, and continental Europe.\n\nLater, Britain was independent of the rest of the Roman Empire for a number of years, first as part of the Gallic Empire, then 20 years later under the usurpers Carausius and Allectus.\n\nChristianity came to Britain in the 3rd century. One early figure was Saint Alban, who (according to tradition) was martyred near the Roman town of Verulamium, on the site of the modern St Albans, during the reign of Emperor Decius.\n\nOne aspect of Roman influence seen in British life was the grant of Roman citizenship. At first this was granted very selectively: to the council members of certain classes of towns, whom Roman practice made citizens; to veterans, either legionaries or soldiers in auxiliary units; and to a number of natives whose patrons obtained citizenship for them. Some of the local Brittonic kings, such as Togidubnus, received citizenship in this manner. The number of citizens steadily increased, as people inherited citizenship and more grants were made. Eventually in 212, everybody except slaves and freed slaves were granted citizenship by the \"Constitutio Antoniniana\".\n\nThe other inhabitants of Britain, who did not enjoy citizenship, the \"Peregrini\", continued to live under the laws of their ancestors. The principal handicaps were that they could not own land with a Latin title, serve as a legionary in the army (although they could serve in an auxiliary unit, and become a Roman citizen upon discharge), or, in general, inherit from a Roman citizen. But for the majority of British inhabitants, who were peasants tied to the soil, citizenship would not dramatically alter their daily lives.\n\nBritannia became one of the most loyal provinces of the Empire until its decline, when Britannia's manpower was diverted by civil wars. Eventually emperor Honorius ordered Roman troops back home to help fight the invading hordes. Constantine III initially rebelled against Honorius and took further troops to Gaul, but was later recognised as a joint emperor.\n\nAfter the Roman departure from Britain, the Romano-British were commanded by Honorius to \"look to their own defences\". A written plea to General Flavius Aëtius, known as the \"Groans of the Britons\", may have brought some brief naval assistance from the fading Roman Empire of the West, but otherwise they were on their own.\n\nIn the early stages the lowlands and cities may have had some organisation or \"council\" and the Bishop of London appears to have played a key role, but they were divided politically as former soldiers, mercenaries, nobles, officials and farmers declared themselves kings, fighting amongst each other and leaving Britain open to invasion. Two factions may have emerged: a pro-Roman faction and an independence faction. The one leader at this time known by name is Vortigern, who may have held the title of \"High King\". The depredations of the Picts from the north and Scotti (Scots) from Ireland forced the Britons to seek help from pagan Germanic tribes of Angles, Saxons and Jutes, who then decided to settle in Britain. Some of the Romano-British people migrated to Brittany, the Kingdom of the Suebi and possibly Ireland.\n\nThe Anglo-Saxons obtained control of eastern England in the 5th century. In the mid-6th century they started expanding into the Midlands, then in the 7th century they expanded again into the south-west and the north of England. The unconquered parts of southern Britain, notably Wales, retained their Romano-British culture, in particular retaining Christianity.\n\nSome Anglo-Saxon histories (in context) refer to the Romano-British people by the blanket term \"Welsh\". The term Welsh is derived from an Old English word meaning 'foreigner', referring to the old inhabitants of southern Britain. Historically, Wales and the south-western peninsula were known respectively as North Wales and West Wales. The Celtic north of England and southern Scotland was referred to in Welsh as Hen Ogledd (\"old north\").\n\nThe struggles of this period have given rise to the legends of Uther Pendragon and King Arthur. There are many theories, but it is sometimes said that Ambrosius Aurelianus, the leader of the Romano-British forces, was the model for the former, and that Arthur's court of Camelot is an idealised Welsh and Cornish memory of pre-Saxon Romano-British civilisation.\n\n\n\n"}

In doing so, TNA placed \"Impact!\" in direct competition with World Wrestling Entertainment's (WWE) flagship program \"Monday Night Raw\". It drew comparisons to the Monday Night Wars, in which defunct wrestling promotion World Championship Wrestling (WCW) program \"Nitro\" went head-to-head with \"Raw\" in a battle for higher Nielsen ratings each week from 1995 to 2001; this led \"Impact!\"s move to sometimes be called \"The New Monday Night Wars\". The move was spurred by the signing of Hulk Hogan and Eric Bischoff, two central figures of the original Monday Night War. Unlike the ratings battle with WCW, TNA never gained traction against WWE, despite initially setting record high ratings for \"Impact!\". \"Impact!\" returned to its Thursday night timeslot after declining ratings in May, less than two months after the move.\nOn October 27, 2009, Hulk Hogan announced that he and Eric Bischoff had signed with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) in a press conference held at Madison Square Garden. TNA President Dixie Carter stated \"Our goal is to become the world's biggest professional wrestling company. Hulk defines professional wrestling and we look forward to partnering with him in a variety of ways as we continue to grow TNA globally.\"\nDuring an appearance on Spike's presentation of \"\" on December 5, Hogan announced that \"Impact!\", which normally aired on Thursdays, would go head to head with World Wrestling Entertainment's (WWE) \"Raw\" on Monday January 4 in a three-hour live broadcast on Spike. Hogan was a top talent in World Championship Wrestling (WCW), which Bischoff was an executive of, when the company debuted a program in 1995, \"Nitro\", to compete with \"Raw\" in a ratings battle called the Monday Night Wars. The January 4 show would be the first time since \"Nitro\"s last episode in March 2001 that two major wrestling promotions would go head-to-head in a Monday night ratings competition. \n\nWWE countered by announcing the return of Bret Hart, who had not appeared in WWE since the Montreal Screwjob in 1997. Leading up to the show, TNA President Dixie Carter stated that while Spike was not expecting \"Impact!\" to beat \"Raw\" in the ratings, it would be considered a success if they managed to at least maintain their usual Thursday night \"Impact!\" rating. Spike president Kevin Kay also announced there were plans to air \"Impact!\" on Mondays quarterly through 2010 and added that if the ratings proved successful on January 4, it could be moved to Monday nights permanently.\n\nBy signing with TNA, Bischoff and Hogan were paired with writer Vince Russo, whom they had conflicted with in WCW and had not worked with since they departed the company after Bash at the Beach 2000. According to Russo, the three met together and worked out their differences before the January 4 show.\n\nThe Monday night \"Impact!\" featured the returns of Scott Hall, Sean Waltman, Sting, Jeff Jarrett, Jeff Hardy, and the debuts of Ric Flair, Sean Morley, The Nasty Boys, Orlando Jordan and Bubba the Love Sponge in addition to Hogan and Bischoff. On \"Raw\", Bret Hart confronted Vince McMahon and Shawn Michaels for the first time in thirteen years.\nThe ratings showed that \"Raw\" came out on top, averaging 5.6 million viewers while \"Impact!\" averaged 2.2 million viewers. The show peaked with three million viewers for the Hulk Hogan segment but then the viewership declined towards the end of the show to near 2.2 million viewers, the replay on January 7, 2010, garnered a 0.9 rating thus giving TNA a combined viewership range of 3.5–4.5 million viewers. However, despite not beating \"Raw\" in the ratings, TNA managed to set a new record for \"Impact!\", beating the previous one of 1.97 million viewers, and thus gaining the confidence of Spike representatives.\n\nOn March 8, 2010, \"Impact!\" moved to Monday nights at 9 pm EST to compete head-to-head with \"Raw\". Eric Bischoff was once again competing on the opposite side of Vince McMahon's WWE and in an interview with Bubba the Love Sponge, he said that he believed \"history is repeating itself\". This new \"war\" began in much the same way as the original did; with TNA relying on established wrestlers, including former WWE talent, and with the company being led by Hulk Hogan and Eric Bischoff. WWE spokesman Robert Zimmerman responded to TNA's move by saying \"We're not too concerned. We're in good shape.\" Bischoff and Russo each stated that TNA were not focused on beating WWE in the ratings straight away, but rather gaining a significant share of their audience and growing TNA's own audience.\nOn the March 8, 2010, \"Raw\" beat \"Impact!\" with a 3.4 rating which equated to approximately 5.1 million viewers, while \"Impact!\" did a 0.98 with 1.4 million viewers; the replay of the show on Thursdays did 1.0, getting TNA a combined audience of 2.7 million viewers. The following week, the March 15 episode of \"Impact!\" scored its lowest rating since November 2006 with a .84 rating. No quarter-hour segment of \"Impact!\" reached past the previous week's overall rating. The broadcast lost 15% of the audience it opened with, going from a .87 opening quarter-hour to a .72 in the A.J. Styles versus Jeff Hardy main event. \"Impact!\" averaged 1.1 million viewers, an overall decrease of 21.4% in viewership from the previous week. \"Raw\" scored a 3.71 rating and averaged 5.60 million viewers, an overall increase of 10% in viewership from the previous week. The broadcast's first hour was the most viewed first hour since August 24, 2009, while the second was the most viewed second hour since January 4, 2010. On March 22, six days before WrestleMania XXVI, \"Raw\" scored a 3.2 and \"Impact!\" scored a 0.86. \"Raw\"s rating was down more than one million viewers, equating to about 20%. Ratings for \"Impact!\" had improved slightly over the last week as they promoted a Career vs. Career match between Jeff Jarrett and Mick Foley.\n\nThe night after WrestleMania XXVI, \"Raw\" scored a 3.7 rating, up from last week, and \"Impact!\" scored a 0.62. Spike executives announced the April 5 live \"Impact!\" would air an hour earlier than \"Raw\" due to competition from an NCAA college basketball tournament. The April 5 episode of \"Raw\" lost 14% of their viewers with a 3.15 rating, while \"Impact!\" scored a 0.9 rating, their highest rating since the March 15 episode, gaining a 33% in total viewers as they aired Kurt Angle vs. Mr. Anderson in a ladder match. After better ratings for the April 5 episode of \"Impact!\", TNA decided to start \"Impact!\" at the 8:00 p.m. ET time slot permanently. The April 12 episode of \"Raw\" made a comeback with a 3.24 rating, while the taped \"Impact!\" scored a 0.8 rating managing to keep most of their audience. Then on April 19, the night after TNA Lockdown, \"Raw\" scored a 3.05 rating, their lowest score in two years, while \"Impact!\" scored a 0.95 rating, their highest score since April 5 as they featured a TNA World Heavyweight Championship match between Rob Van Dam and A.J. Styles. On April 26, \"Raw\" aired the 2010 WWE draft, and scored a 3.3 rating, while \"Impact!\" lost 48% of their audience with a 0.5 rating.\n\n\"Impact!\" moved back to Thursday nights starting with the May 13 show. On the final battle between \"Raw\" and \"Impact!\", \"Raw\" drew a 3.05 and \"Impact!\" drew a 0.8 rating gaining a 37.5% in total viewers. The replay ratings of most of Monday night episodes were sufficient for survival but showed that the average audience is some two million viewers that prefer to watch on Thursdays. \nIn a press release, Spike TV's Senior Vice President of Sports and Specials, Brian J. Diamond, said: \"The fans have spoken and with their input we have determined the best time slot to maximize the TNA audience is on Thursday nights where we are confident it will be among the most-watched shows with young men\". In the same announcement, TNA president Dixie Carter was quoted as saying, \"Our fans made it clear that they preferred the Thursday night time period. By moving to Thursdays, this is a win/win opportunity for both TNA and the fans. We are looking forward to delivering what the fans are asking for.\"\n\n\"Vice\" described the move as one of many gambles TNA has taken during their history, but wrote that it \"turned out disastrously.\" \"Impact!\" ratings dropped seven percent from 2009's 1.14 average, finishing 2010 at 1.06. \"WrestleView\" ascribed the drop to the \"disastrous decision\" to run opposite \"Raw\". Although the move failed to boost ratings for TNA, James Caldwell of \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" attributed a six percent drop in \"Raw\" ratings (from 3.69 to 3.47) to competition from \"Impact!\" At the end of 2010, the \"New Monday Night Wars\" received the annual WrestleCrap Gooker Award, which honors the worst events in wrestling. \n\nBy July 2011, nearly all of the new talents brought in for \"Impact!\"s initial Monday launch had left the company, with the exceptions of Ric Flair (who left the following year) and Jeff Hardy (who left in 2017). Hulk Hogan departed TNA in October 2013. Eric Bischoff was sent home from TNA in October 2013 and his contract expired in early 2014. When asked about positive memories from his time in TNA, Bischoff stated, \"I don’t have any.\" \n\nIn the tenth anniversary reprint of R.D. Reynolds and Brian Alvarez's \"Death of WCW\", the authors compared the move to the original Monday Night Wars. They wrote that TNA did not have the audience that WCW did when they moved to initiate the Monday Night Wars, pointing out that \"WCW Saturday Night\" typically did better than WWE shows did in the weekend timeslots. Reynolds and Alvarez also wrote that TNA did not have the financial resources that WCW did and that WWE was not \"asleep at the wheel\" as they were in 1995.\n"}

Created circa 1803–1805, the drawing has been held in London's Tate gallery since 1949. It is likely a visionary and hallucinatory summary of scenes from Chapters 4 and 5 of the Book of Revelation when the throne of God was presented to the prophet Saint John the Divine.\n\nSaint John described the scene,\n\nBlake's depiction was created as part of a commission of biblical watercolours for his friend and patron Thomas Butts. The artist began to work on Butts's series around 1800. For stylistic reasons—including the use of pencil instead of pen and ink—it is generally believed by scholars that Blake began work on the piece sometime in 1803. Paintings and drawings from the series are typically characterised by intense displays of colour and \"The Four and Twenty Elders\" is generally held as one of the most vivid examples of Blake's output from the period.\n\nIn this watercolour, Blake arranges the various elements and characters from the biblical text in a highly symmetrical and organised manner. God is pictured sitting on his throne at the center of the panel and portrayed as an ancient figure with a long and broad white beard, dressed in red clothing. The Deity holds a book or scroll in his right hand, according to scripture, \"written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals', while his left hand is raised in a gesture of benediction and blessing. His throne is enclosed by a rainbow which radiates from below a pointed Gothic arch formed from the wings of angels. Before the throne is a slain lamb, \"having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth\". The lamb's seven horns are represented by seven spikes fanned above his corpse, while the seven cherubic heads beneath him allude to the \"seven Spirits of God\". Each cherub is crowned by a tongued flame, a reference to the \"seven lamps of fire\" described in Revelation 4.5.\n\nIn Revelation, Saint John wrote,\n\nA row of twelve white-clad bearded figures float on either side of the Deity, although only four figures from each row are visible to the viewer of the panel. Each figure bends towards God, in adoration, to lay a golden crown at his feet. Above the head of God are the Four Beasts, \"full of eyes before and behind\". Above and to the left of God perches the Eagle, opposite of whom is the Lion. Both are portrayed with the pallor of death and both are situated beneath the distorted heads of monstrous birds and animals. The Ox and Angel are positioned behind the throne and peer outwards, according to the Blake collector W. Graham Robertson, \"dimly [and] half hidden in the pale crimson and violet rays which emanate from the central figure, and shoot up to meet and be absorbed in the rainbow.\"\n\nThere are many uses of numerical symbolism in \"The Four and Twenty Elders\", and according to the Blake scholar Martin Myrone, \"the way, as with [Blake's] \"Ezekiel's Wheels\", that multiples and unities meld into one another, underpinned Blakes own poetic conceptions.\"\n\nThe painting was first passed to Butts and upon his death was bequeathed to his son. In 1906, it passed to W. Graham Robertson for £6,720. Following Robertson's passing, the panel was sold at auction at Christie's to the Tate in 1949, with financial assistance from the National Art Collections Fund.\n\n\n\n<br>\n"}

It has an international membership.\n\nOdysseus Yakoumakis discovered Stuckism in July, 2004, while surfing the net, and saw in it an antidote to what he deems \"the ailments of the contemporary Greek 'artscape'\". He contacted Charles Thomson, the London founder of Stuckism, and a few days later founded The Romantic Anonymous Fellowship. He conceived this as a \"Greek version of Stuckism, an antidote to contemporary Greek art's provincialism, sectarianism and servile importation of post-modernism\". He developed the concept of \"Romantic Stuckism\", that is of \"Stuckism with a good injection of Eleatic and Platonic philosophy, oriented rather towards encouraging each artist to pursue his/her genuinely personal artistic vision rather, than towards pointless polemics against the reactionary official art-establishment\". He published the first two Romantic Stuckist theoretical texts on the Fellowship's website.\n\nAt that stage he was the Fellowship's only fellow and, as far as he knew, the only artist in Greece aware of the Stuckist movement. He contacted other fine artists in Athens, but described the reactions he got as \"ranging from a tepid 'academic curiosity' to a sheer lack of interest or even, occasionally, to a politely concealed hostility.\" He was however contacted by artists from overseas and accepted them into the Fellowship. The first to apply was Ian J. Burkett, a painter living in London and founder of the Ealing Stuckists group. Shortly after, followed the painter and etcher Ilania Abileah from Canada, and the painter and etcher Anthe (who is of Greek descent) from the US.\n\nYakoumakis determined that Stuckism should, nevertheless, be brought \"in the flesh\" before the eyes of the Greek fine arts community, and organised the first Stuckist event in Greece, titled \"Under the Cover of Romantic Anonymity\", announced for May 14 of 2010 at the Ash-In-Art Gallery, Athens, Greece.\n\nIn parallel with the show, the new book by Odysseus Yakoumakis will be featured, titled \"Leaflets from the Wilderness (a case study about the artscape in nouveau-Greece and many other lands)\" (Ash-In-Art Publications).\n\nStuckist artists taking part include: \nGuest artists participating are:\n\n\n\n"}

It was based on the second movement, \"Rondeau\", of the \"Abdelazer\" suite. It was originally commissioned for the British educational documentary film called \"Instruments of the Orchestra\" released on 29 November 1946, directed by Muir Mathieson and featuring the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Malcolm Sargent; Sargent also conducted the concert première on 15 October 1946 with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic in the Philharmonic Hall, Liverpool, England.\n\nThe work is one of the best-known pieces by the composer, and is often associated with two other works in the context of children's music education: Saint-Saëns' \"The Carnival of the Animals\" and Prokofiev's \"Peter and the Wolf\".\n\nThis work, in the composer's own words, \"is affectionately inscribed to the children of John and Jean Maud: Humphrey, Pamela, Caroline and Virginia, for their edification and entertainment\".\n\n\"The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra\" is scored for symphony orchestra:\n\n\nThe work is based on the Rondeau from Henry Purcell's incidental music to Aphra Behn's \"Abdelazer\", and is structured, in accordance with the plan of the original documentary film, as a way of showing off the tone colours and capacities of the various sections of the orchestra.\n\nIn the introduction, the theme is initially played by the entire orchestra, then by each major family of instruments of the orchestra: first the woodwinds, then the brass, then the strings, and finally by the percussion. Each variation then features a particular instrument in depth, generally moving through each family from high to low (the order of the families is slightly different from the introduction). So, for example, the first variation features the piccolo and flutes; each member of the woodwind family then gets a variation, ending with the bassoon; and so on, through the strings, brass, and finally the percussion.\n\nAfter the whole orchestra has been effectively taken to pieces in this way, it is reassembled using an original fugue which starts with the piccolo, followed by all the woodwinds, strings, brass and percussion in turn. Once everyone has entered, the brass are re-introduced (with a strike on the tamtam) with Purcell's original melody.\n\nThe sections of the piece and instruments introduced by the variations are as follows.\n\n\nThe narration for the documentary film was written by Eric Crozier, the producer of the first production of Britten's opera \"Peter Grimes\", and is sometimes spoken by the conductor or a separate speaker during performance of the piece. The composer also arranged a version without narration. The one without narration is more often recorded. The commentary often alters between recordings.\n\nA new narration was written by Simon Butteriss for the Aldeburgh Festival and broadcast live by CBBC presenter Johny Pitts with the BBC Symphony Orchestra for the Britten 100 celebrations in 2013.\n\nComedian and author John Hodgman wrote a new narration of \"The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra\" in 2015 for a series of performances with the Boston Pops.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3821602", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3821602", "title": "Time Crisis 4", "text": "Time Crisis 4\n\nTime Crisis 4 is the fourth installment in Namco's \"Time Crisis\" series which introduces new features to the cover-based light gun shooter gameplay engine of its predecessors alongside a new story and roster of characters. It was initially released as an arcade game in 2006, and was ported in 2007 for PlayStation 3, with the Guncon 3 light gun peripheral and features a new first-person shooter mode. It was later re-released as part of \"\" with support for the PlayStation Move controller but without the first-person shooter mode.\n\nThe game opens in California, where intelligence officials from both the United States Armed Forces and the paramilitary V.S.S.E. organization learn about a top secret weapon targeted for terrorists' smuggling and their plot. William Rush infiltrates a pier to gather information, and finds that the enemy has already acquired the insect-like weapons (codenamed \"Terror Bite\"). After being told by Elizabeth Conway about an information leak incident at the airport, Rush goes to the airport to help VSSE agents Giorgio Bruno and Evan Bernard, who had been sent to stop the weapons trade. After leaving the airport, they head to the city, where they defeat Marcus Black. They discover U.S. Army dog tags on each enemy, meaning they are not terrorists. The terrorist faction is then revealed to be the Biological Weapons Special Operations Unit (AKA the Hamlin Battalion).\n\nAfter Rush escapes from the collapsing dam, he, Giorgio and Evan fly to Wyoming's secluded bio-weapons research facility, where after defeating Jack Mathers, they soon learn that the Hamlin Battalion is attacking Buckley Air Force Base near Aurora, Colorado, prompting the men to rush to the AFB. As Rush, Giorgio, and Evan invade there from the outside, a couple of unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) depart the base without warning. Rush leads the Colorado National Guard toward an entrance, while Giorgio and Evan try to take care of the UCAVs. They also encounter V.S.S.E.'s old enemy Wild Dog in the base who, in addition to his standard hand gun, gatling gun and RPG, is now armed with a grappling hook and tractor beam device. After a long battle, Giorgio and Evan defeat him, ending with Wild Dog detonating himself once again. Meanwhile, Rush defeats Wild Fang (Wild Dog's younger partner from the previous game), sending him into the path of a UCAV as it lifts off.\n\nIt is revealed that the Terror Bites' creator, Colonel Gregory Barrows ordered the nuclear-armed UCAVs to destroy the United States in a retaliation scheme for the poor treatment he received from the military. After Giorgio and Evan defeated Barrows near the control center, Rush and his unit form a human pyramid to lift Giorgio and Evan into it to stop the missiles, where the agents press a big red button on the control computers to self-destruct all nuclear missiles that the UCAVs have already launched.\nThe game was first shown at E3 2006 prior to its recent final revision arcade release. One major change is the addition of the multi-screen or multi-hiding system, introduced in \"\". Unlike \"Project Titan\", which players went on the offensive, players are placed on the defensive. In \"Project Titan\", players had to hide and shoot arrows to switch screens. Screen switching has been refined to allow the player to merely point the gun outside the screen to move around. The game also utilizes a new light gun control with infrared emitters. Prior to this, all Namco light gun games used gun controllers that relied on cathode ray timing. Because Namco's light guns with cathode ray timing utilized memory chip-to-lens pointing, the arcade cabinet designers had to ensure that the infrared-emitting light gun controllers would provide the same accuracy as their cathode ray timing-based gun provided in the past. This delayed the game's release given past accuracy issues with IR light guns. The player can choose to customize gun calibration and/or turn the blowback on or off with a pre-game code explained in the cabinet. The game, like its predecessors is available either in a 29\" standard twin cabinet or a 52\" deluxe twin. It also includes the multiple weapon system introduced in \"Time Crisis 3\", with the pistol, shotgun, machine gun, and grenade launcher, and also features new vehicle sections with similar gameplay mechanics to the Sega Arcade/Nintendo Wii shooters Gunblade NY and LA Machineguns. On several occasions, the player is equipped with a machine gun with infinite ammo or a sniper rifle used to shoot the tires on a marauding truck. Several other functions exclusive to the game includes a scene where the player must pull himself from quicksand, several scenes where a certain position must be defended, with the penalty of one life if the position is lost. On multiple occasions, Rush appears onscreen, whether caught in a trap or attacking an enemy as a diversion and care must be taken to avoid shooting him. It also features a voice navigation system that guides players through different situations. Given the voice navigation system, it can be voiced either in Japanese or English. Prior to the game, it was voiced exclusively in English.\n\nThe game was released for Sony's PlayStation 3 exclusively bundled with the GunCon 3 light gun peripheral, the PlayStation 3 edition features 480p (4:3) and 720p (16:9 widescreen) support and a specially-programmed first-person shooter mode, which players engage combat similar to a typical FPS game, but with manual gun pointing, aiming, and firing, in addition to the arcade mode. Players play as Captain William Rush for 5 levels and as VSSE agents Giorgio Bruno or Evan Bernard for 10 levels through the game's \"complete mission\", complete with arcade footages when playing as Giorgio or Evan. Much like its predecessors, it featured the Crisis Missions that has some backstories, starring star of Time Crisis characters from previous installments. The game was re-released on the PlayStation 3 as part of \"\", released in October 2010, with support of the PlayStation Move controllers.\n\nThe game received mixed reviews, with an average GameRankings score of 60.70%, and a Metacritic score of 60 out of 100. GameSpot gave the game a 5.5 out of 10, while Jeff Haynes of IGN gave it an 8 out of 10, concluding that it is \"a fun game for any shooting fan looking to blast away with their PS3.\" Matt Miller of \"Game Informer\", however, was more critical of the game, giving it a score of 4.25 out of 10, criticizing its first-person shooter mode, \"ludicrous plot\", and shooting mechanic. \"GamePro\" rated \"Time Crisis 4\" a positive score of 4 out of 5, saying the games plays just like the arcade, but replayability is an issue. \"X-Play\" also gave the game a score of 4 out of 5.\n\nOne of the main key areas was the Guncon 3 controller included with the game. Chris Remo of Shacknews stated that it uses \"two analog sticks for full movement and camera control, with pointer-based aiming on top\" and that once \"you get accustomed to it, this control actually works just fine, and feels like it could be the basis for its own game. \" According to Miller, however, the controller \"feels cheap,\" with analog sticks that are \"chintzy and hard to use\"; referring to the left-hand subgrip which forces the main shooting handgrip to be held with the right hand, Miller claims that the Guncon 3 \"hardly accommodates left-handed players.\" Ryan Davis of GameSpot expressed that the complexity of the control scheme seems to contradict the pick-up-and-play mentality of the light gun genre.\n"}

{"id": "35424118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35424118", "title": "Women in engineering", "text": "Women in engineering\n\nWomen are often under-represented in the fields of engineering, both in academia and in the profession of engineering, yet many have contributed to the diverse fields of engineering historically and currently. A number of organizations and programs have been created to understand and overcome this tradition of gender disparity. Some have decried this gender gap, saying that it indicates the absence of potential talent. Though the gender gap as a whole is narrowing, there is still a growing gap with minority women compared to their white counterparts.\n\nThe history of women as designers and builders of machines and structures predates the development of engineering as a trade. Prior to the creation of the term \"engineer\" in the 11th century, women had contributed to the technological advancement of societies around the globe, including Hypatia of Alexandria (350 or 370–415 AD), who is credited with the invention of the hydrometer. By the 19th century, women who participated in engineering work often had academic training in mathematics or science. Ada Lovelace was privately schooled in mathematics before beginning her collaboration with Charles Babbage on his analytical engine that would earn her the designation of the \"first computer programmer.\" In the early years of the 20th century, greater numbers of women began to be admitted to engineering programs, but they were generally looked upon as anomalies by the men in their departments.\n\nThe first University to award an engineering's bachelor's degree for women was University of California, Berkeley. Elizabeth Bragg was the recipient of a bachelor's degree in civil engineering in 1876, becoming the first female engineer in the United States. Prior to the 19th century, it was very rare for women to earn bachelor's degree in any field because they did not have the opportunity to enroll in universities due to gender disparities. Some universities started to admit women to their colleges by the early 1800s and by the mid-1800s they started to admit them into all academic programs including engineering.\n\nThe entry of the United States into World War II created a serious shortage of engineering talent in that country as men were drafted into the armed forces. To address the shortage, initiatives like GE on-the-job engineering training for women with degrees in mathematics and physics and the Curtiss-Wright Engineering Program among others created new opportunities for women in engineering. Curtiss-Wright partnered with Cornell, Penn State, Purdue, the University of Minnesota, the University of Texas, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and Iowa State University to create an engineering curriculum that lasted ten months and focused primarily on aircraft design and production.\n\nDuring this time, since the female representation in the engineering field, there were barely public attacks on women. Chiefly, these attacks were kept quiet inside institutions due to the fact that women did not pressure aggressively to shift the gender gap between men and women in the engineering field. Another reason why these “attacks” were kept private is due to how men believed that it was impossible for engineering to stop being a male-dominated field.\n\nWomen's roles in the workforce, specifically in engineering fields changed greatly during the Post–World War II period. As women started to marry at later ages, have fewer children, divorce more frequently and stopped depending on male breadwinners for economic support, they started to become even more active in the engineering labor force despite the fact that their salaries were less than men's.\n\nWomen also played a crucial role in programming the ENIAC from its construction during the World War II period through the next several decades. Originally recruited by the Army in 1943, female ENIAC programmers made considerable advancements in programming techniques, such as the invention of breakpoints, now a standard debugging tool.\n\nIn addition to the wartime shortage of engineers, women also made inroads in engineering fields due to the gradual increase in public universities admitting female students. For example, Georgia Tech began to admit women engineering students in 1952, while the École Polytechnique in Paris, a premier French engineering institution, began to admit female students in 1972.\n\nStereotype threat may contribute to the under-representation of women in engineering. Because engineering is a traditionally male-dominated field, women may be less confident about their abilities, even when performing equally. At a young age, girls do not express the same level of interest in engineering as boys, possibly due in part to gender stereotypes. There is also significant evidence of the remaining presence of implicit bias against female engineers, due to the belief that men are mathematically superior and better suited to engineering jobs. Women who persist are able to overcome these difficulties, enabling them to find fulfilling and rewarding experiences in the engineering profession.\nDue to this gender bias, women's choice in entering an engineering field for college is also highly correlated to the background and exposure they have had with mathematics and other science courses during high school. Most women that do choose to study engineering have significant experience with regarding themselves better at these types of courses and as a result, think they are capable of studying in a male-dominated field.\n\nWomen's self-efficacy is also a contributor to the gender stereotype that plays a role in the underrepresentation of women in engineering. Women's ability to think critically that they can be successful and perform accomplishments is correlated to the choices they have when choosing a college career. Women that show high self-efficacy personalities are more prone to choose to study in the engineering field. Self-efficacy is also correlated to gender roles because men often present higher self-efficacy than women, which can also be a cause to why when choosing a major, most women opt to not choose the engineering major.\n\nOver the past few years 40 percent of women are leaving the engineering field, there are many factors leading to why they don't go into engineering because of women being judged about going into a difficult major such as engineering, working in difficult workplace conditions. According to the Society of Women Engineers one in four female leave the field after a certain age.\n\nWomen are under-represented in engineering education programs as in the workforce (see Statistics). Enrollment and graduation rates of women in post-secondary engineering programs are very important determinants of how many women go on to become engineers. Because undergraduate degrees are acknowledged as the \"latest point of standard entry into scientific fields\", the under-representation of women in undergraduate programs contributes directly to under-representation in scientific fields. Additionally, in the United States, women who hold degrees in science, technology, and engineering fields are less likely than their male counterparts to have jobs in those fields.\n\nThis degree disparity varies across engineering disciplines. Women tend to be more interested in the engineering disciplines that have societal and humane developments, such as agricultural and environmental engineering. They are therefore well-represented in environmental and biomedical engineering degree programs, receiving 40-50% of awarded degrees in the U.S. (2014–15), women are far less likely to receive degrees in fields like mechanical, electrical and computer engineering.\n\nA study made by the Harvard Business Review discussed the reasons why the rates of women representation in the engineering field are still low. The study discovered that rates of female students in engineering programs are continuous because of the collaboration aspects in the field. The results of the study chiefly determined how women are treated differently in group works in which there are more male than female members and how male members “excluded women from the real engineering work”. Aside from this, women in this study also described how professors treated female students differently “just because they were women”.\n\nDespite the fact that fewer women enroll in engineering programs across the nation, the representation of women in STEM-based careers can potentially increase when college and university administrators work on implementing mentoring programs and work-life policies for women. \nResearch shows that these rates have a hard time increasing since women are judged as less competent than men to perform supposedly “masculine jobs”.\n\nAnother possible reason for lower female participation in engineering fields is the prevalence of values \"associated with the male gender role\" in workplace culture. For example, some women in engineering have found it difficult to re-enter the workforce after a period of absence. Because men are less likely to take time off to raise a family, this disproportionately affects women.\n\nMales are also associated with taking leadership roles in the workplace. By holding a position of power over the women, they may create an uncomfortable environment for them. For example, lower pay, more responsibilities, less appreciation as compared to men.\n\nCommunication is also a contributing factor to the divide between men and women in the workplace. A male to male communication is said to be more direct,\nbut when a man explains a task to a woman, they tend to talk down, or “dumb down” terms. This comes from the stereotype that men are more qualified than women for engineering, causing men to treat women as inferiors instead of equals.\n\nPart of the male dominance in the engineering field is explained by their perception towards engineering itself. A study in 1964 found that both women and men believed that engineering was in fact masculine.\n\nThe masculinity dominating engineering majors and fields proves the issues that men themselves believe that they “naturally” excel in fields related to mathematics and sciences while women “naturally” excel in linguistics and liberal arts. In the past few decades, women's representation in the workforce in STEM fields, specifically engineering, has significantly improved. In 1960 women made up around 1% of all the engineers and by the year 2000 women have made up 11% of all engineers.\n\nSeveral colleges and universities nationwide want to decrease the gender gap between men and women in the engineering field by recruiting more women into their programs. The strategies used for recruiting more female undergraduate students are: increasing women's exposure to stem-courses during high school, planting the idea of positivism relating gender from the engineering culture, producing a more female-friendly environment inside and outside the classroom. These strategies have helped institutions encourage more women to enroll in engineering programs as well as other STEM-based majors. \nFor universities to encourage women to enroll in their graduate programs, institutions have to emphasize the importance of recruiting women, emphasize the importance of STEM education in the undergraduate level, offer financial aid, and develop more efficient methods for recruiting women to their programs.\n\nFemales are underrepresented as both graduate students in engineering and working engineers. The number of bachelor's degrees awarded to women dropped from 20.4% in 2003, down to 17.8% in 2009, and back up to 18.9% in 2012. Women's underrepresentation in the engineering workforce varies by field. In the year 2008 women Mechanical Engineers made up 6.7%, Electrical and Electronics made 7.7%, Aerospace and Civil made 10.4%, Chemical made 13.1% and Computer and Software Engineers made up 20.9% of the workforce. These values are even more outnumbered while quantifying the number of women who hold doctorates.\n\nThe percentage of master's degrees awarded to women has not changed much from 2003 (22.3%) to 2012 (23.1%). The percentage of doctoral degrees awarded to women in engineering increased from 11.6% in 1995, to 17.4% in 2004, to 21.1% in 2008, then to 22.2% in 2012.\n\nSince 1997, the percentage of Asian females enrolling in engineering majors has risen from about 30% to 34% but somehow also dropped in 2002. African American females have increased their representation in engineering from 21% to 33% in the same time frame. Mexican American (Chicana) and Puerto Rican females have had an increase in their representation from 25% to 31%. Even if ethnicities are included in these statistics, men from all ethnicities still outnumber the proportion of women who enroll in engineering bachelor programs.\n\nThere is a significant drop-off rate regarding the number of women who earn a bachelor's degree and the women who afterward enroll in graduate school. Over the last 35 years, women have been more likely than men to enroll in graduate school right after receiving their bachelor's degree. Women who do not enroll in a graduate program right after earning their bachelor's degree tend to be caregivers who face work-family conflicts in the context of family women.\nThe workforce remains the area of lowest representation for women. In 2009, women comprised 48% of the total workforce, but only 14% of the engineering workforce.\n\nOnly 14% of engineers in Australia are women. The retention of female engineers is also disproportionally low; in 2006, 62.6% of qualified male engineers were employed in engineering professions, as opposed to 47.1% of qualified female engineers.\n\nThough women tend to make up more than half of the undergraduate population in Canada, the number of women in engineering is disproportionately low. Whereas in 2001, 21 percent of students in engineering programs were female, by 2009, this had fallen to 17 percent. One commentator attributed this drop to a number of factors, such as the failure of higher education programs to explain how engineering can improve others' lives, a lack of awareness of what engineers do, and discomfort of being in a male-dominated environment and the perception that women must adapt to fit in.\n\nIn the 1990s, undergraduate enrollment of women in engineering fluctuated from 17 to 18%, while in 2001, it rose to 20.6%. In 2010, 17.7% of students in undergraduate engineering were women.\n\nFemale undergraduate enrollment was highest in 2010 in environmental, biosystems, and geological engineering.\n\nThe number of women enrolled in undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral engineering programs tends to vary by province, with the highest number in Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia.\n\nOn average, 11% of engineering faculty are women and the percentage of leadership roles held by women is an average of 9%. The University of Toronto has the highest female faculty rate in Canada at 17% and École Polytechnique de Montréal, University of British Columbia, and Dalhousie University all have a female faculty rate of 13%.\n\nIn 2011, the INWES Education and Research Institute (ERI) held a national workshop, Canadian Committee of Women in Engineering (CCWE+20), to determine ways of increasing the number of women in the engineering field in Canada. CCWE+20 identified a goal of increasing women's interest in engineering by 2.6 percent by 2016 to a total of 25 percent through more incentives such as through collaboration and special projects. The workshop identifies early education as one of the main barriers in addition to other factors, such as: \"the popular culture of their generation, the guidance they receive on course selection in high school and the extent to which their parents, teachers, and counselors recognize engineering as an appropriate and legitimate career choice for women.\" The workshop report compares enrollment, teaching, and professional statistics from the goals identified in 1997 compared to the actual data from 2009, outlining areas of improvement (see table, right).\n\n\n"}
