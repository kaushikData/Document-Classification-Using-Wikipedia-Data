The use of an honor code depends on the notion that people (at least within the community) can be trusted to act honorably. Those who are in violation of the honor code can be subject to various sanctions, including expulsion from the institution. Honor codes are used to deter academic dishonesty and should be taken seriously at all times.\n\nThe documented history of an academic honor code dates back to 1736 at The College of William and Mary and is the oldest honor code in the United States. Still a tradition, students administer the honor pledge to each incoming student and educate faculty and administration on the relevance of the Code and its application to students' lives at the College. Students administer the Code through six Honor Councils and the Council of Chairs. The College of William and Mary founded the Phi Beta Kappa academic honor society in 1776 and was the first school of higher education in the United States to install an honor code of conduct for students. It is based upon the premise that honor is one's most cherished attribute.\n\nIn a community devoted to learning, a foundation of honor among individuals must exist if that community is to thrive with respect and harmony among its members. An honor system is an ideal mechanism to ensure such a state of affairs. With it, students and faculty are afforded a freedom that otherwise may not be available. With that freedom comes each individual's responsibility to conduct oneself in such a way that the spirit of mutual trust which sustains the system is not compromised.\n\nThe Honor Code applies to alleged acts of lying, stealing or cheating that adversely affect the College community committed by a student on campus or elsewhere.\n\nPresently, some of the most notable and most stringent honor codes exist at the United States Military Academy (see Cadet Honor Code), Virginia Military Institute, the United States Air Force Academy, the United States Merchant Marine Academy, and the United States Coast Guard Academy. The United States Naval Academy has an \"Honor Concept,\" which is similar in scope to the honor codes at the other academies.\n\nThe military academy honor codes not only govern the cadets' and midshipmen's lives at the academies but also are deemed essential to the development of military officers who are worthy of the public trust. As such, the codes are not limited merely to academic situations or to conduct on campus; cadets and midshipmen are expected to live by the codes' ethical standards at all times. The codes are as old as the academies themselves and simply state that cadets and midshipmen do not lie, cheat or steal, nor tolerate those who do. A single-sanction Honor Code, in which any offense results in expulsion regardless of severity, exists at Virginia Military Institute, which features a \"drum out\" ceremony which is still carried out upon a cadet's dismissal. Outside of the military, Washington and Lee University and the University of Virginia also have single sanction codes.\n\nAt three of the service academies and at Virginia Military Institute, anyone who learns of an honor code violation is required to report it. Failure to do so is considered \"toleration,\" which itself violates the code. That also holds true at schools with combined cadet and traditional student programs, such as Norwich University, Texas A&M, and The Citadel, whose honor codes specifically provide that all students, both cadets and civilians, do not \"tolerate those who do.\" It is notable that the three Senior Military Colleges have two honor codes, one for cadets and one for civilians, whether on-campus or through distance online programs, etc. The Honor Concept of the Brigade of Midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy allows the observer of an honor violation to confront the accused without formally reporting. It was found that it was more constructive at developing the honor of midshipmen. A non-toleration clause, on the other hand, is believed to make enemies of classmates. Additionally, it is thought that one's true honor, if other than utmost, was not able to be formally remediated when hidden from public view. Under the academies' honor codes, violators can face severe punishment, up to being forwarded for expulsion by the Secretary of the Army, Navy, or Air Force.\n\nStringent honor codes, however, are not limited to military institutions. The all-male Hampden–Sydney College is reputed for an honor code system on a par with military systems, which extends to all student activities both on and off campus (off-campus violations can be prosecuted), and also like the military system, it considers tolerance of a violation itself a violation. Like the Naval Academy, however, those who witness a violation are encouraged to confront the violator and convince them to turn themselves in before resorting to reporting the violation. Another school with a very strict honor code is Brigham Young University. The university not only mandates honest behavior but also incorporates various aspects of Mormon religious law: drinking, smoking, drug use, and premarital sex are all banned. Also, the code includes standards for dress and grooming. Men must be clean-shaven, and men and women cannot wear short shorts or other revealing clothing.\n\nMany military academies have strict Honor systems, such as the following:\n\nIn addition, the following colleges with a Corps of Cadets maintain an honor code for both the cadets and civilian students:\nNorwich University\nTexas A&M University\nVirginia Tech \nThe Citadel\n\nThere are also traditional liberal arts and technical universities that maintain Honor systems:\n\nThere are differences between the honor codes of different universities. \n\n\n"}

The inscription at the head of the mosaic, as well as its artistic style, indicate that it was made by Armenian artists.\n\nThe mosaic is located in an old building, outside Damascus Gate, near the beginning of HaNeviim street. This building is located in what was once the Jewish neighborhood Kirya Ne'emana, which was destroyed during the Israeli War of Independence, and Arab houses were built on its ruins. This mosaic is one of four Armenian mosaics from the Byzantine period which were discovered in this part of Jerusalem, and it seems we can learn from this about the activity of the Armenian community in that period.\n\nThe mosaic was discovered in 1894 in the process of building the foundation for a house. The Turkish authorities requested that the archaeologists Frederick J. Bliss and Archibald Dickie, who were working at the time on Mount Zion, to take upon themselves the excavation work. The development work slightly damaged the edges of the mosaic, and as soon as it was discovered the work ended, and the process of uncovering and preserving the mosaic began. A small cave was discovered under the southeast part of the mosaic, including human bones and oil lights, which were dated to the Byzantine period. When the Armenian inscription was revealed, the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem expressed interest in purchasing the house, and eventually did purchase it, out of desire to emphasize the importance and centrality of the Armenian community in Byzantine Jerusalem. To this day, the mosaic is considered one of the most important sites in the history of the Armenian community in the city. As of 2009, entrance to the site is possible only by coordination with the Patriarchate.\n\nAbout 1000 mosaic floors have been discovered in the land of Israel. Most have been dated to the Byzantine period, between the years 450 and 640, when Muslims conquered the area and church art declined. Most of the mosaics adorned the floors of Greek or Armenian churches.\n\nThis mosaic covers an area of about 4 by 7 meters. It has been almost fully preserved, including a full Armenian inscription which states \"To the memory and redemption of all the Armenians, whose names are known only to God\". This inscription seems to indicate that the mosaic decorated the floor of a memorial chapel for the dead, a common feature of Armenian churches in the Byzantine period. Apparently the cave which was discovered under the mosaic served as part of the chapel, and perhaps it is the burial place of those Armenians \"whose names are known only to God\". Based on the inscription and the mosaic style, it was dated to around the year 550, since beginning in this period there are indications of Armenian presence in Jerusalem. The Armenian alphabet was created only in 404, so the mosaic cannot be any earlier than this.\n\nThe mosaic includes many figures of birds, which are inscribed in 39 round medallions formed from images of grape vines. The mosaic is bounded by a colorful \"braided\" frame. This is a symmetric mosaic, where elements on the right side are \"reflected\" to the left, so every bird on the right side has a twin on the left side, except those on the central axis. Therefore, most of the birds are facing the central axis. The birds lack \"depth \" and perspective: while Greek and Roman mosaic art involved perspective and three-dimensional depiction, Byzantine mosaic art which developed in Israel in the 5th century was influenced by Eastern art which tended towards \"flattening\" of images and division of the area into squares or medallions.\n\nThe mosaic's head is at the entrance to the room, where an amphora is displayed with peacocks on either side. The amphora with peacocks is a common motif in Byzantine mosaic art in Israel, which can also be found in the old church in Nahariya or the Byzantine church in Sebastopol. Thin, round grape vines extend from the mouth of the amphora to create the framework of the 39 medallions. Many grape leaves and clusters branch off of the vines, and are scattered around the mosaic. Interwoven grape vines are another common motif in Byzantine mosaic floors in Egypt, including in synagogues from the period, such as in Gaza and Maon. It seems that the artists of the period thus continued the Roman mosaic tradition.\n\nThe birds have been identified by scholars as a variety of species found in Israel, including pigeons, geese, storks, swallows, partridge, pheasants, and more. Armenian mosaic artists extensively used natural motifs, such as trees, flowers, birds, and other animals. The motifs are therefore a clear characteristic of Armenian art in general, and to this day Armenian ceramics, for example, are characterized by natural designs.\n\nThe subject of the mosaic, according to many scholars, is the memory of the dead by the living, and the passage from this world to the afterlife. The inscription at the head of the mosaic indicates that the chapel was intended to preserve the memory of the deceased, and the entire mosaic comes, then, to strengthen the connection between the worlds. According to this approach, one may see the caged bird as a symbol of the soul encaged in the body, which separates it from the body-free souls in the afterlife. The conch, which appears above the amphora on the central axis of the mosaic, is a motif taken from ancient Greek art, where it symbolizes a holy place or royalty. Perhaps this is a symbol of \"the kingdom of heaven\". In addition, the eagle (or vulture) which looks backwards, unlike the other birds, perhaps symbolizes the separation from the dead and their memory. The large amphora, grape vines, and two peacocks are also motifs from the afterlife, as archaeologist Michael Avi-Yonah wrote about the synagogue in Maon in the southern West Bank: \"The amphora and tendrils represent the Garden of Eden, and the peacocks on either side represent immortality.\"\n\nIn 1950, a mosaic was discovered in Caesarea, which likewise included many depictions of birds within medallions. This mosaic was originally identified as a church, but later excavations in 2004 led to the conclusion that it was the courtyard of a palace from the late Byzantine period.\n\nDespite the great similarity in terms of style and material between the two mosaics, there is no further connection between them. The Jerusalem mosaic is small, the medallions are separated by grape vines, the birds face the central axis, an the building was religious. In contrast, the Caesarea mosaic is almost three times larger, the medallions have a stone border, all the birds face to the left, and the building was private. In addition, it is unknown who created the Caesarea mosaic, and there is no indication that the artists were Armenian.\n\n\n"}

He presented his design to represent the revolutionary army at the inauguration of the Society for Regenerating China, an anti-Qing society in Hong Kong, on February 21, 1895.\n\nDuring the Wuchang Uprising in 1911 that heralded the Republic of China, the various revolutionary armies had different flags. Lu Hao-tung's \"Blue Sky with a White Sun\" flag was used in the provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou, while the \"18-Star Flag\", \"Five-Colored Flag\", and other designs were used elsewhere.\n\nWhen the government of the Republic of China was established on January 1, 1912, The \"Five-Colored\" flag was adopted as the national flag, but Sun Yat-sen did not consider its design appropriate, reasoning that horizontal order implied a hierarchy or class like that which existed during dynastic times. Thus, when he established a rival government in Guangzhou in 1917, he brought over the \"Blue Sky with a White Sun\" flag for the party and the \"Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth\" () flag, which was then the naval ensign, for the nation. This officially became the national flag in 1928 while the \"Blue Sky with a White Sun\" flag was adopted as the naval jack.\n\nThe \"Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth\" flag has remained the flag of the Republic of China to this day.\n\nThe national emblem of the Republic of China was derived from the Blue Sky with a White Sun flag. The emblem was designed by He Yingqin at Whampoa Military Academy in 1924 and was set as the national emblem by the \"Law of national flag and national emblem of the Republic of China\" in 1928.\n\nOn the national emblem rays of sun have some distance to the edge, symbolizing the broadness of the sky, while on Kuomintang emblem the rays reach the edge, symbolizing the spirit of revolution is as powerful as the sun.\n\nThe national emblem of the Republic of China from 1913 to 1928 is called Twelve Symbols national emblem, based on the traditional symbols on clothes of ancient Chinese emperors. It was designed by Lu Xun, Qian Daosun and Xu Shoushang on August 28, 1912 and was set as national emblem in February 1913. It remained as the national emblem during the Empire of China from 1915 to 1916. After the Northern Expedition it was replaced by the Blue Sky with a White Sun national emblem in 1928.\n\nIn the early years of the Republic, under the KMT's political tutelage, the Blue Sky with a White Sun Flag shared the same prominence as the ROC flag. A common wall display consisted of the KMT flag perched on the left and the ROC flag perched on the right, each tilted at an angle with a portrait of National Father Sun Yat-sen displayed in the center. After the promulgation of the Constitution of the Republic of China, the party flag was removed from such displayed and the national flag moved to the center.\n\nSince the ROC government moved to Taiwan and especially in the years since the end of martial law the KMT flag has lost some of its prominence. However, it is still frequently seen on KMT party buildings in political rallies and other meetings of KMT and the pan-blue coalition.\n\nThe flag and the KMT party emblem made news during the ROC legislative elections of 2004, when President Chen Shui-bian suggested that the Kuomintang's flag and party emblem violated the ROC's National Emblem Law for being too similar to the national emblem of the Republic of China. Chen stated that the law forbids the ROC's emblem and flag from being used by non-governmental organizations and warned that the KMT would have three months to change its flag and emblem if his Democratic Progressive Party won a majority of seats in the legislature. The KMT responded by asking the government to change the national emblem, saying the KMT emblem existed first. However, the pan-green coalition failed to win a majority, and Chen took no action for the remainder of his presidency.\n\nThe design of \"Blue Sky with a White Sun\" was used in the unit insignia or coats of arms of some units of the United States Army that fought in World War II. The most famous unit was Merrill's Marauders (officially named the \"5307th Composite Unit (Provisional)\"), which has the \"Blue Sky with a White Sun\" as part of its badge. The usage by American troops was a result of cooperation between US and Chinese Expeditionary Force in the China Burma India Theater. Postwar US military units stationed in Taiwan, including the United States Taiwan Defense Command (USTDC) and the Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG), also used the design in their badges.\n\nUp to now, the \"Blue Sky with a White Sun\" can still be seen in the emblem of the 75th Ranger Regiment.\n\n\n"}

Today, as the Celtic inhabited-areas significantly differ, the term still refers to making something Celtic, usually focusing around the Celtic nations and their languages.\n\nDuring the 1st millennium BC, the early Celts expanded from a core territory in Atlantic Europe to Iberia, the British Isles and later also the Balkans and central Europe, and are assumed to have \"Celticized\" (Pre-Celtic) earlier populations such as Illyrians and Thracians in the Balkans and Basques elsewhere.\n\nThe Celticization in Pannonia began as early as the 4th century BC. La Tene type finds are characteristic in Pre-Roman Pannonia and are considered a marker to variations in the degree of Celticization. Among the Illyrian tribes some were Celticized to varying degrees (some completely) like the Pannoni and the Dalmatae. A type of wooden oblong shield with an iron boss was introduced to Illyria from the Celts. Illyrian chiefs and kings wore bronze torques around their necks much as the Celts did.\n\nThe Celts had two settlements that later became cities in Illyria, namely Navissos and Segestica. In Thrace they had Serdica (modern Sofia, Bulgaria), \"Tylis\", founded by Gauls, Dunonia, Singidunum and Taurunum.\n\nMany Celtic tribes or parts of Celtic tribes migrated to Illyria, Thrace and Dacia.\n\nThe gradual Celticization of all of Pannonia took place in the 3rd century BC. Names became Celtic, as seen in Roman times, and Celts had established control north of the Sava and south and west of the Danube. In the western half and west of Pannonia the Pre-Celtic language disappeared. By the first half of the 1st century BC the language of the Illyrians in Northern Dalmatia was completely Celticized. There is an abundance of Celtic names in Illyria sometimes making the Illyrian ones seem few. Those parts of Pannonia that had not been conquered by the first Celtic invasion were already Celticized by the beginning of the 3rd century BC. The Dalmatae had been Celticized by the 3rd century BC. In the region of Pannonia as a Roman province Celticization had almost completely eradicated Illyrian culture.\n\nIn the Alpine region as a whole, there is evidence that the non-Celtic elements had, by the time of Augustus, been assimilated by the influx of Celtic tribes and had adopted Celtic speech. According to Livy, the \"sound\" of the Raeti's original tongue (\"sonum linguae\") had become corrupted as a result of inhabiting the Alps. This may indicate that at least some of the tribes lost their ancestral Raetic tongue to Celtic. Celticisation also finds support in the Roman practice of twinning the Raeti with their neighbours to the North, the Vindelici, who are regarded by most historians to have been Celtic- speakers.\n\nBy the 4th century BC the Veneti had been so Celticized that Polybius wrote that the Veneti of the 2nd century BC were identical to the Celts except for language. The Greek historian Strabo (64 BC–AD 24), on the other hand, conjectured that the Adriatic Veneti were descendant from Celts who in turn were related to later Celtic tribe of the same name who lived on the Belgian coast and fought against Julius Caesar.\n\nIn the modern era, there are attempts made to reverse the effects of centuries of Anglicisation and other assimilations and re-introduce Celtic languages. Most particularly in Wales, Welsh language has seen a halt in its decline and even signs of revival, with approximately half a million fluent speakers. There have also been recent attempts to revive the Cornish language, as its last native speaker died in the 1970s, and there are now several schools in Cornwall teaching in Cornish. The Breton language remains endangered as the number of its speakers continues to decline.\n\nGaelicisation is a sub-branch of celticisation, derived from Gaels, referring to modern-day Scotland, Ireland and Isle of Man.\n\n"}

{"id": "65402", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65402", "title": "Dime novel", "text": "Dime novel\n\nThe dime novel is a form of late 19th-century and early 20th-century U.S. popular fiction issued in series of inexpensive paperbound editions. The term \"dime novel\" has been used as a catchall term for several different but related forms, referring to story papers, five- and ten-cent weeklies, \"thick book\" reprints, and sometimes early pulp magazines. The term was used as a title as late as 1940, in the short-lived pulp magazine \"Western Dime Novels\". In the modern age, the term \"dime novel\" has been used to refer to quickly written, lurid potboilers, usually as a pejorative to describe a sensationalized but superficial literary work.\n\nIn 1860, the publishers Erastus and Irwin Beadle released a new series of cheap paperbacks, \"Beadle's Dime Novels\". \"Dime novel\" became a general term for similar paperbacks produced by various publishers in the early twentieth century. The first book in the Beadle series was \"Malaeska, the Indian Wife of the White Hunter\", by Ann S. Stephens, dated June 9, 1860. The novel was essentially a reprint of Stephens's earlier serial, which had appeared in the \"Ladies' Companion\" magazine in February, March and April 1839. It sold more than 65,000 copies in the first few months after its publication as a dime novel. Dime novels varied in size, even in the first Beadle series, but were mostly about , with 100 pages. The first 28 were published without a cover illustration, in a salmon-colored paper wrapper. A woodblock print was added in issue 29, and the first 28 were reprinted with illustrated covers. The books were priced, of course, at ten cents.\n\nThis series ran for 321 issues and established almost all the conventions of the genre, from the lurid and outlandish story to the melodramatic double titling used throughout the series, which ended in the 1920s. Most of the stories were frontier tales reprinted from the numerous serials in the story papers and other sources, but many were original stories.\n\nAs the popularity of dime novels increased, original stories came to be the norm. The books were reprinted many times, sometimes with different covers, and the stories were often further reprinted in different series and by different publishers.\n\nThe literacy rate increased around the time of the American Civil War, and \"Beadle's Dime Novels\" were immediately popular among young, working-class readers. By the end of the war, numerous competitors, such as George Munro and Robert DeWitt, were crowding the field, distinguishing their product only by title and the color of the paper wrappers. Beadle & Adams had their own alternate \"brands\", such as the Frank Starr line. As a whole, the quality of the fiction was derided by highbrow critics, and the term \"dime novel\" came to refer to any form of cheap, sensational fiction, rather than the specific format.\n\nNonetheless, the pocket-sized sea, Western, railway, circus, gold-digger, and other adventures were an instant success. Author Armin Jaemmrich observes that Alexis de Tocqueville's theses in Democracy in America (1835) says that in democratic and socially permeable societies, like that of the U.S., the lower classes were not \"naturally indifferent to science, literature, and the arts: only it must be acknowledged that they cultivate them after their own fashion, and bring to the task their own peculiar qualifications and deficiencies.\" He found that in aristocratic societies education and interest in literature were confined to a small upper class, and that the literary class would arrive at a \"sort of aristocratic jargon, ... hardly less remote from pure language than was the coarse dialect of the people.\" According to Tocqueville, due to the heterogeneity of its population, the situation in the U.S. was different, and people were asking for reading matter. Since, in his view, practically every American was busy earning a living with no time for obtaining a higher education let alone for timeconsuming distractions, they preferred books which \"may be easily procured, quickly read, and which require no learned researches to be understood ... they require rapid emotions, startling passages ... Small productions will be more common than bulky books ... The object of authors will be to astonish rather than to please, and to stir the passions more than to charm the taste.\" Written twenty-five years prior to the emergence of the dimes, his words read like an exact anticipation of their main characteristics.\n\nAdding to the general confusion as to what is or is not a dime novel, many of the series, though similar in design and subject, cost ten to fifteen cents. Beadle & Adams complicated the matter by issuing some titles in the same salmon-colored covers at different prices. Also, there were a number of ten-cent, paper-covered books of the period that featured medieval romance stories and melodramatic tales. This makes it hard to define what falls in the category of the dime novel, with classification depending on format, price, or style of material. Examples of dime novel series that illustrate the diversity of the form include \"Bunce's Ten Cent Novels\", \"Brady's Mercury Stories\", \"Beadle's Dime Novels\", Irwin P. Beadle's \"Ten Cent Stories\", \"Munro's Ten Cent Novels\", \"Dawley's Ten Penny Novels\", \"Fireside Series\", \"Chaney's Union Novels\",\" DeWitt's Ten Cent Romances\", \"Champion Novels\", \"Frank Starr's American Novels\", \"Ten Cent Novelettes\", \"Richmond's Sensation Novels\", and \"Ten Cent Irish Novels\".\n\nIn 1874, Beadle & Adams added the novelty of color to the covers when their \"New Dime Novels\" series replaced the flagship title. The \"New Dime Novels\" were issued with a dual numbering system on the cover, one continuing the numbering from the first series and the second and more prominent one indicating the number in the current series; for example, the first issue was numbered 1 (322). The stories were mostly reprints from the first series. Like its predecessor, Beadle's \"New Dime Novels\" ran for 321 issues, until 1885.\n\nMuch of the content of dime novels came from story papers, which were weekly, eight-page newspaper-like publications, varying in size from tabloid to full-size newspaper format and usually costing five or six cents. They started in the mid-1850s and were immensely popular, some titles being issued for over fifty years on a weekly schedule. They are perhaps best described as the television of their day, containing a variety of serial stories and articles, with something aimed at each member of the family, and often illustrated profusely with woodcuts. Popular story papers included \"The Saturday Journal\", \"Young Men of America\", \"Golden Weekly\", \"Golden Hours\", \"Good News\", and \"Happy Days\".\n\nMost of the stories in dime novels stood alone, but in the late 1880s series characters began to appear and quickly grew in popularity. The original Frank Reade stories first appeared in \"Boys of New York\". The Old Sleuth, appearing in \"The Fireside Companion\" story paper beginning in 1872, was the first dime-novel detective and began the trend away from the western and frontier stories that dominated the story papers and dime novels up to that time. He was the first character to use the word \"sleuth\" to denote a detective, the word's original definition being that of a bloodhound trained to track. He is also responsible for the popularity of the use of the word \"old\" in the names of competing dime novel detectives, such as Old Cap Collier, Old Broadbrim, Old King Brady, Old Lightning, and Old Ferret, among many others. Nick Carter first appeared in 1886 in the \"New York Weekly\". Frank Reade, the Old Sleuth and Nick Carter had their own ten-cent weekly titles within a few years.\n\nIn 1873, the house of Beadle & Adams introduced a new ten-cent format, , with only 32 pages and a black-and-white illustration on the cover, under the title \"New and Old Friends\". It was not a success, but the format was so much cheaper to produce that they tried again in 1877 with \"The Fireside Library\" and \"Frank Starr's New York Library\". The first reprinted English love stories, the second contained hardier material, but both titles caught on. Publishers were no less eager to follow a new trend then than now. Soon the newsstands were flooded by ten-cent weekly \"libraries\". These publications also varied in size, from as small as 7 x 10 inches (\"The Boy's Star Library\" is an example) to 8.5 x 12 (\"New York Detective Library\"). The \"Old Cap Collier Library\" was issued in both sizes and also in booklet form. Each issue tended to feature a single story, unlike the story papers, and many of them were devoted to a single character. Frontier stories, evolving into westerns, were still popular, but the new vogue tended to urban crime stories. One of the most successful titles, Frank Tousey's \"New York Detective Library\" eventually came to alternate stories of the James Gang with stories of Old King Brady, detective, and (in a rare occurrence in the dime novel) several stories which featured both, with Old King Brady doggedly on the trail of the vicious gang.\n\nThe competition was fierce, and publishers were always looking for an edge. Once again, color came into play when Frank Tousey introduced a weekly with brightly colored covers in 1896. Street & Smith countered by issuing a weekly in a smaller format with muted colors. Such titles as \"New Nick Carter Weekly\" (continuing the original black-and-white \"Nick Carter Library\"), \"Tip-Top Weekly\" (introducing Frank Merriwell) and others were 7 x 10 inches with thirty-two pages of text, but the 8.5 x 11 Tousey format carried the day, and Street & Smith soon followed suit. The price was also dropped to five cents, making the magazines more accessible to children. This would be the last major permutation of the product before it evolved into pulp magazines. Ironically, for many years it has been the nickel weeklies that most people refer to when using the term \"dime novel\". \nThe nickel weeklies were popular, and their numbers grew quickly. Frank Tousey and Street & Smith dominated the field. Tousey had his \"big six\": \"Work and Win\" (featuring Fred Fearnot, a serious rival to the soon-to-be-popular Frank Merriwell), \"Secret Service\", \"Pluck and Luck\", \"Wild West Weekly\", \"Fame and Fortune Weekly\", and \"The Liberty Boys of '76\", each of which issued over a thousand copies weekly. Street & Smith had \"New Nick Carter Weekly\", \"Tip Top Weekly\", \"Buffalo Bill Stories\", \"Jesse James Stories\", \"Brave & Bold Weekly\" and many others. The Tousey stories were generally the more lurid and sensational of the two.\n\nPerhaps the most confusing of the various formats lumped together under the term \"dime novel\" are the so-called \"thick-book\" series, most of which were published by Street & Smith, J. S. Ogilvie and Arthur Westbrook. These books were published in series, contained roughly 150 to 200 pages, and were , often with color covers on a higher-grade stock. They reprinted multiple stories from the five- and ten-cent weeklies, often slightly rewritten to tie them together.\n\nAll dime-novel publishers were canny about reusing and refashioning material, but Street & Smith excelled at it. They developed the practice of publishing four consecutive, related tales of, for example, Nick Carter, in the weekly magazine, then combining the four stories into one edition of the related thick-book series, in this instance, the \"New Magnet Library\". The Frank Merriwell stories appeared in the \"Medal, New Medal\" and \"Merriwell\" libraries, Buffalo Bill in the \"Buffalo Bill Library\" and \"Far West Library\", and so on. The thick books were still in print as late as the 1930s but carry the copyright date of the original story, often as early as the late nineteenth century, leading some dealers and new collectors today to erroneously assume they have original dime novels when the books are only distantly related.\n\nIn 1896, Frank Munsey had converted his juvenile magazine \"The Argosy\" into a fiction magazine for adults, the first of the pulp magazines. By the turn of the century, new high-speed printing techniques combined with cheaper pulp paper allowed him to drop the price from twenty-five cents to ten cents, and sales of the magazine took off. In 1910 Street and Smith converted two of their nickel weeklies, \"New Tip Top Weekly\" and \"Top Notch Magazine\", into pulps; in 1915, \"Nick Carter Stories\", itself a replacement for the \"New Nick Carter Weekly\", became \"Detective Story Magazine\", and in 1919, \"New Buffalo Bill Weekly\" became \"Western Story Magazine\". Harry Wolff, the successor in interest to the Frank Tousey titles, continued to reprint many of them into the mid-1920s, most notably \"Secret Service, Pluck and Luck, Fame and Fortune\" and \"Wild West Weekly\". These two series were purchased by Street & Smith in 1926 and converted into pulp magazines the following year, effectively ending the era of the dime novel.\n\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, collecting dime novels became popular, and prices soared. Even at that time the cheap publications were crumbling into dust and becoming hard to find. Two collectors, Charles Bragin and Ralph Cummings, issued a number of reprints of hard-to-find titles from some of the weekly libraries.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "355720", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=355720", "title": "E. Haldeman-Julius", "text": "E. Haldeman-Julius\n\nEmanuel Haldeman-Julius (\"né\" Emanuel Julius) (July 30, 1889 – July 31, 1951) was a Jewish-American socialist writer, atheist thinker, social reformer and publisher. He is best remembered as the head of Haldeman-Julius Publications, the creator of a series of pamphlets known as \"Little Blue Books,\" total sales of which ran into the hundreds of millions of copies.\n\nEmanuel Julius was born July 30, 1889, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of David Julius (\"né\" Zolajefsky), a bookbinder. His parents were Jewish emigrants who fled Odessa (then part of the Russian Empire) and emigrated to America to escape religious persecution. His paternal and maternal grandfathers had both been rabbis but his own parents were not religious. \"[T]hey were indifferent, for which I thank them.\"\n\nAs a boy, Emanuel read voraciously. Literature and pamphlets produced by the socialists were inexpensive; Julius read them and was convinced by their arguments. As he put it in 1913, \"Only four years ago, I was a factory hand — slaving away in a textile mill in Philadelphia. I came upon the philosophy of Socialism and it put a new spirit into me. It lifted me out of the depths and pointed the way to something higher. I commenced to crave for expression. I felt that I have something to say. So, I scribbled things down. And, to my surprise, Socialist editors gave me a little encouragement.\" He joined the Socialist Party before World War I and was the party's 1932 Senatorial candidate for the state of Kansas.\n\nAfter working for various newspapers, Julius rose to particular prominence as an editor (1915-1922) of the \"Appeal to Reason\", a socialist newspaper with a large but declining national circulation. He and his first wife, Marcet Haldeman (whose last name he adopted in hyphenate), purchased the \"Appeal\"'s printing operation in Girard, Kansas and began printing 3.5\" x 5\" pocket books on cheap pulp paper (similar to that used in pulp magazines), stapled in paper cover. These were first were called \"The Appeal's Pocket Series\" and sold in 1919 for 25 cents. The covers were either red or yellow. Over the next several years Haldeman-Julius changed the name successively to \"The People's Pocket Series\", \"Appeal Pocket Series\", \"Ten Cent Pocket Series\", \"Five Cent Pocket Series\", \"Pocket Series\" and finally in 1923, \"Little Blue Books\". The five cent price of the books remained in place for many years. Many titles of classic literature were given lurid titles in order to increase sales. Eventually, millions of copies per year were sold in the late 1920s.\n\nIn 1922 they renamed the \"Appeal\" as \"The Haldeman-Julius Weekly\" (known from 1929 to 1951 as \"The American Freeman\"), which became the house organ. In 1924 they launched \"The Haldeman-Julius Monthly\" (later renamed \"The Debunker\"), which had a greater emphasis on Freethought, and in 1932 added \"The Militant Atheist\", among other journals.\n\nThe novelist Louis L’Amour (1908-1988) described the Haldeman-Julius publications in his autobiography and their potential influence:\nRiding a freight train out of El Paso, I had my first contact with the Little Blue Books. Another hobo was reading one, and when he finished he gave it to me. The Little Blue Books were a godsend to wandering men and no doubt to many others. Published in Girard, Kansas, by Haldeman-Julius, they were slightly larger than a playing card and had sky-blue paper covers with heavy black print titles. I believe there were something more than three thousand titles in all and they were sold on newsstands for 5 or 10 cents each. Often in the years following, I carried ten or fifteen of them in my pockets, reading when I could.\n\nAmong the books available were the plays of Shakespeare, collections of short stories by De Maupassant, Poe, Jack London, Gogol, Gorky, Kipling, Gautier, Henry James, and Balzac. There were collections of essays by Voltaire, Emerson, and Charles Lamb, among others. There were books on the history of music and architecture, painting, the principles of electricity; and, generally speaking, the books offered a wide range of literature and ideas. […] In subsequent years I read several hundred of the Little Blue Books, including books by Tom Paine, Charles Darwin, and Thomas Huxley.\n\nThe couple had two children: Alice Haldeman-Julius Deloach (1917–1991) and Henry Haldeman-Julius (1919–1990; he later changed his name to Henry Julius Haldeman). They adopted Josephine Haldeman-Julius Roselle (b. 1910). Marcet and Emanuel legally separated in 1933. Marcet died in 1941, and a year later Haldeman-Julius married Susan Haney, an employee.\n\nIn 1948 the FBI targeted and questioned Haldeman-Julius after his publication of \"The FBI - The Basis of an American Police State: The Alarming Methods of J. Edgar Hoover.\" In June 1951 Haldeman-Julius was found guilty of income tax evasion by a Federal grand jury and sentenced to six months in Federal prison and fined $12,500. The next month he drowned in his swimming pool. His son Henry took over his father's publishing efforts, and the books continued to be sold until the printing house burned down on July 4, 1978.\n\nHaldeman-Julius's papers are held at Pittsburg State University in Pittsburg, Kansas, a few miles from Girard in the southeastern corner of the state, as well as at the University of Illinois at Chicago, Indiana University and California State at Northridge.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23796306", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23796306", "title": "Epic Mickey", "text": "Epic Mickey\n\nEpic Mickey is a platform game developed by Junction Point Studios and published by Disney Interactive Studios for the Wii console. The game focuses on Mickey Mouse, who accidentally damages a world created by Yen Sid for forgotten characters and concepts, and is forced to fix the world while combating antagonists with a magic paintbrush. \"Epic Mickey\" notably features the first appearance of one of Walt Disney's first successful cartoon characters, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, as a major character since 1943. The game also marks the first time that Oswald and Mickey appeared together.\n\n\"Epic Mickey\" was part of an effort by Disney to re-brand the Mickey Mouse character by placing less emphasis on his pleasant, cheerful side and reintroducing the more mischievous and adventurous sides of his personality, focusing on the idea of depicting him as an epic hero. It was directed by Warren Spector, who collaborated with both Walt Disney Animation Studios and Pixar in conjunction with the project. The game was announced in 2009, and released in November 2010. While the game received average reviews from critics, it has garnered a following in later years. It has successors to the franchise such as and Castle of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse (2013 video game). The Castle of Illusion game is also known as Epic Mickey: Castle of Illusion. \n\n\"Epic Mickey\" is primarily a platform game and allows players to use their own solutions for getting through the levels. \"Epic Mickey\" features a morality system similar to games like \"Infamous\", \"\", and \"Shadow the Hedgehog\". Different alliances, side-quests and power-ups are made available depending on the choices of the player. It is also possible to avoid mini-bosses if specific actions are taken. Currency which is called Tickets, is important to these boss fights.\n\nThe game's key feature is the paint brush, which Mickey wields, that has the ability to draw or erase objects using paint and paint thinner. For example, obstacles can be erased from physical existence using the thinner and then restored using the paint, or enemies can be befriended by revitalizing them with the paint or destroyed completely using the thinner. Mickey is also able to materialize objects from sketches, which have various effects. Two of the three sketches, the watch and the television, slow down time and distract enemies, respectively. Both fluids have limited reserves, adding a strategic element to gameplay: players must compromise between making various tasks harder or easier to accomplish. However, the fluids automatically but slowly refill, and power-ups that quickly replenish the fluids are available in certain areas. Mickey can also find pins in Wasteland. Most are bronze, silver, or gold pins, but some are special: for example, the \"Art Appreciator\" or \"Mean Street\" pin. Another thing that is useful in the game is a type of currency called E-tickets. These can be given or discovered. They are used to buy concept art, pins, health refills, or paint or thinner refills.\n\nTo travel between sections of the Wasteland, Mickey traverses 2D side-scrolling levels based on his cartoon shorts (with three being based on Oswald shorts; \"Trolley Troubles\", \"Great Guns\", and \"Oh, What a Knight\" and two being based on \"Sleeping Beauty\" and \"Fantasia\"), such as \"Steamboat Willie\" and \"Clock Cleaners\".\n\nThe game is set in the Cartoon Wasteland, a pen-and-paper stylised world, created in the game's narrative by the sorcerer Yen Sid, as a place for \"forgotten things\", namely disused or obscure Disney characters. It is physically inspired by Disneyland, and appears as an intricate model in Yen Sid's workshop. However, Mickey Mouse's tampering with Yen Sid's magic paint brush and paint thinner causes mass damage to the model, creating a post-apocalyptic landscape. The land is tormented by the evil Shadow Blot, a monstrous being loosely based on the Phantom Blot, an antagonist to Mickey in the comic strips created by Floyd Gottfredson. There are also the Beetleworx, mismatched audio-animatronics designed by the Mad Doctor.\n\nThe Wasteland is split into several locations based on the various lands from Disneyland and other Disney theme parks. Mean Street, is based on Main Street, U.S.A., which is home to Horace Horsecollar and Pete, though other incarnations of the latter appear through the game. The Gremlin Village is inspired by Fantasyland, based primarily around It's A Small World. The attraction's iconic clock tower serves as the first boss battle in the game. Mickeyjunk Mountain is based on the Matterhorn Bobsleds, and is covered in Mickey Mouse toys and merchandise. Other locations include Bog Easy, based on New Orleans Square, which is home to the Lonesome Manor, based on the Haunted Mansion; Ventureland, based on Adventureland; Tomorrow City, based on Tomorrowland; and OsTown, based on Mickey's Toontown, where Clarabelle Cow, and animatronic versions of Goofy, Donald Duck, and Daisy Duck live.\n\nMickey Mouse, out of curiosity, enters Yen Sid's workshop through a mirror in his house and discovers the model of a land Yen Sid created (which is based on Disneyland) and the tool used to create it, the paintbrush. Fiddling with the brush and some paint to make a self-portrait, Mickey accidentally creates the Shadow Blot. Panicking, Mickey quickly tries to erase the Blot by throwing paint thinner onto it, but spills more paint on the model in the process. Upon seeing Yen Sid approaching, Mickey quickly tries to clean up the mess, but in his haste, spills thinner onto the paint spillage as he flees back to his house, while the Blot, having survived Mickey's attempt to destroy it, enters through a portal created by the paint/thinner mixture (taking the Jug -the bottle of thinner- with him) and takes control of the ruined world from its first resident, Oswald (\"The world I had created was ravaged - a wasteland\").\n\nAfter many decades of fame following the accident, Mickey had forgotten it all until the Shadow Blot enters his home through the mirror and abducts him into the ruined forgotten world, now named by this time as the Wasteland. Oswald all the while had his will and his mind twisted from years of hiding and his jealousy of Mickey's rise to fame, unaware the enigmatic Mad Doctor (who was formerly loyal to Oswald before siding with the Blot) and the Blot formulate a plan to steal Mickey's heart away, which they plan to use to escape the ruined world, as all Wasteland Toons living there are forgotten and can't leave Wasteland since they no longer have hearts of their own. However, Mickey frees himself before they can succeed and scares off the Blot with Yen Sid's brush, forcing the Mad Doctor to flee. Oswald, who was spying on them, also flees after tampering with the Mad Doctor's machines, leaving Mickey to deal with the Mad Doctor's now-hostile mechanical arm.\n\nGus, one of the Gremlins (who serves as mechanics and helpers throughout Wasteland) helps Mickey disable the mechanical arm and escape Dark Beauty Castle, which the Mad Doctor was using as a hideout. Mickey also discovers that he was soaked with some of the Blot's ink. During his journey through the Wasteland, Mickey is guided by Gus and becomes armed with Yen Sid's brush, which grants Mickey the power to spray Paint and Thinner and allows him to erase or paint in toon objects and fight Blotlings and Beetleworx (evil robots built by the Mad Doctor). After traveling through the Gremlin Village and fighting the Clock Tower (who has been driven insane after hearing the song \"It's a Small World\" for decades), he makes it to Mean Street, where the Wasteland Toons mainly reside. Mickey uses the brush to restore the Wasteland in order to atone for his destruction and win Oswald's trust. After passing through Ostown and Mickeyjunk Mountain, they find Oswald, who agrees to help Mickey escape. They go to Tomorrow City and find a rocket they can use to leave, but Oswald finds the Mad Doctor has stolen essential parts from it to use for his evil plans, so Mickey goes to collect them. He retrieves the first part after defeating Petetronic (a robotic version of Pete), the second after defeating a mechanical version of Captain Hook, and confronts the Mad Doctor in the Lonesome Manor. After defeating him, he reveals to have turned himself into a Beetleworx, which will allow him to survive the Blot's revolt before he is sent flying after Gus removes the last rocket part from his hovercraft. After acquiring all the rocket parts, Oswald has Mickey help repel an attack on Mickeyjunk Mountain. \n\nAfter defeating a fake Blot (Oswald revealed the Shadow Blot Mickey fought along with all the Blotlings he encountered were drippings of the real Blot and that the fake Blot is the real Blot's second-in-command), Oswald reveals that he and his girlfriend, Ortensia, attempted to seal the Blot away, but Ortensia was blighted by the Blot in the process and entered an inert state. When attempting to reconcile, Mickey eventually comes to terms with his actions in causing what the Toons call \"the thinner disaster\", and reveals all to Oswald, who loses his temper. While jumping angrily on the cork sealing the Jug, Oswald accidentally causes the cork to break, allowing the true form of the Shadow Blot- a giant specter constructed from paint thinner- to escape his prison into the world. The Blot takes Oswald and Gus, threatening to kill them if Mickey does not allow the Blot to take his heart. Mickey yields his heart to the Blot, who then proceeds to destroy the Wasteland before moving on to the Disney universe to wreak havoc there. Mickey, Oswald and Gus attempt to use the rocket to reach the Blot, but end up crashing into Dark Beauty Castle after the Blot absorbs the rocket's paint. The three successfully manage to destroy the Blot, eliminating his exterior with paint-laden fireworks on Dark Beauty Castle, and rescue Mickey's heart from the inside. Oswald reunites with Ortensia and befriends Mickey, the two now possibly bonding with each other as brothers. With the Wasteland now regenerating, Mickey escapes back to Yen Sid's workshop and returns home through the mirror, which becomes sealed by Yen Sid to prevent Mickey from entering again and cause any more mischief.\n\nRegardless of what choices Mickey made in the Wasteland (Yen Sid shows Mickey the positive outcomes or consequences of his major choices in the game), the ending after the credits is the same: Not long after the mirror is sealed, Mickey discovers that he still has some of the Shadow Blot's ink in him, leaving the possibility he may still be able to reach the Wasteland.\n\nThe creative development team at Buena Vista Games formed the original concept for \"Epic Mickey\" in 2003. When the concept was pitched to Bob Iger, then-president and COO, he lamented that Disney no longer owned the rights to Oswald the Lucky Rabbit and could not produce the game. Upon becoming CEO, he made it a goal to bring Oswald back to Disney. His chance came in 2006, when television sportscaster Al Michaels expressed interest in joining NBC (which had merged with Universal by this time) to call play-by-play for \"Sunday Night Football\", even though he had just signed a long-term deal with Disney-owned ESPN to continue on \"Monday Night Football\". Iger initiated a trade with NBC Universal that would allow Michaels to be released from his contract in exchange for the rights to Oswald and other minor assets. Disney Interactive Studios was unable to secure a developer for the game until 2007, when Disney acquired Junction Point Studios, Warren Spector's company.\n\nThe game was originally intended to be released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and its name was its working title. Development on the Wii started in 2008. When the idea of a Wii port of the game was raised, Spector replied that a straight Wii port would not be viable, remarking that many of the \"design ideas just won't work on the Wii, we need to give the Wii its dues\". Graham Hopper of Disney Interactive then suggested dropping the development of the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions completely, and instead releasing it solely on the Wii.\n\nConcept art for the game by Fred Gambino and Gary Glover depicted a surrealistically bizarre look at Disney characters and locations in a steampunk environment (this art has been categorized as very preliminary concept art and it is not the style of the final game). Featured in the concept art are post-apocalyptic renditions of Goofy, Daisy Duck, Donald Duck, Captain Hook, Disneyland's Dumbo the Flying Elephant, Mad Tea Party, Main Street, Tomorrowland, Mickey's Toontown, Donald Duck's boat, Astro Orbitor, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, Splash Mountain, It's a Small World, the Haunted Mansion, Epcot's Spaceship Earth, Disney's Hollywood Studios' \"Earful Tower\", The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror, and Hong Kong Disneyland's Sleeping Beauty Castle.\n\nCompared to the \"Kingdom Hearts\" series, a similar video game franchise created by Japanese video game company Square Enix, which combined modern-day Disney characters with their own \"Final Fantasy\" characters, \"Epic Mickey\" emphasizes retro-vintage and long-lost Disney characters that were created much earlier, and draws more plot elements from the film \"Fantasia\", rather than \"Final Fantasy\"; in \"Kingdom Hearts II\", a location in the game was based on the 1920s \"Steamboat Willie\" cartoon, but other than that, the rest of the game took its cast from more recently created characters.\n\nMickey receives a character redesign in this game, which attempts to give him a \"retro\" look, and the game uses an animation engine to replicate the stretchy athleticism of cartoons. The 2D cinematics were created by Powerhouse Animation Studios, Inc, and the game utilizes Emergent Game Technologies' Gamebryo Engine. Warren Spector has stated that \"Epic Mickey\" was planned as a trilogy. An early idea for the game was for Mickey to adopt an angrier look when he was played in the \"scrapper\" manner; this idea was dropped after Spector decided it changed Mickey too much from people's perceptions of the character. Mickey looks more smudged instead.\n\nMarvel Comics has confirmed that there will be a comic for \"Epic Mickey\", titled: \"Disney's Epic Mickey: Tales of the Wasteland\". It will serve as a prequel to the game, focusing on Mickey's half-brother Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, and give some insight on what the Wasteland was like before Mickey's appearance and the thinner disaster. Initially distributed on Disney's Digicomics platform for iOS products, a print version released in late-August 2011. An art book, \"The Art of Epic Mickey\", also released in September 2011. A U.S.-exclusive \"Epic Mickey Collector's Edition\" was announced that includes special packaging, special behind-the-scenes DVD, Mickey vinyl figure, a Wii Remote skin, and Wii console skins.\n\nThe game was leaked by warez groups weeks before its official release date. \"Epic Micke\"y marks Oswald's second appearance in video games after \"Férias Frustradas do Pica-Pau\" (released in Brazil only).\n\nThe music was composed by American composer James Dooley. In addition his original works, arranged versions of Disney music appears throughout the game, which in turn were recreations of older Disney cartoons. X-Play later named it \"Best Soundtrack of 2010\". Dooley's score was released digitally via iTunes and Amazon on December 21, 2010.\n\nWriter Peter David, who in 2010 was an exclusive writer for Disney-owned Marvel Comics, wrote a graphic novel adaptation of \"Epic Mickey\", and a prequel digicomic, \"Disney's Epic Mickey: Tales of Wasteland\". Disney also promoted the release of the game with a launch party at the Times Square Disney Store in Manhattan on November 30, 2010, the day the game was released. Present at the party was designer Warren Spector, Peter David, and actors Jennifer Grey and Kyle Massey, who had recently completed the eleventh season of the U.S. \"Dancing with the Stars\", which is broadcast on the Disney-owned ABC.\n\n\"Epic Mickey\" received positive reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.\n\nIGN gave it a score of 8/10, criticizing its camera, control issues and lack of voice acting, but praised its charm, story, art design, and lasting appeal for the players. Video game talk show \"Good Game\"s two presenters gave the game a 6 and 7 out of 10. They compared the paintbrush abilities to that of the water jet pack from \"Super Mario Sunshine\" and found it frustrating how the levels reset back to their original state after leaving. But on a positive note they said it \"isn't as 'dark' or 'adult' as the hype made it out to be... I guess it is a kid's game after all, but at least it's an intelligent one. It doesn't come anywhere near the complexity and fun of something like \"Super Mario Sunshine\", which I think it borrows some ideas from.\" Shirley Chase from GameZone complimented the game on its usage of Disney history, but added that the game had numerous flaws saying, \"For all of its good points, Disney Epic Mickey does have some glaring flaws, which can make the game feel like a chore. The most noticeable problem is the camera, which will lead to more cheap deaths than anything else.\" In a review for GamesRadar, Chris Antista who began the article as an admitted \"diehard Disney dork\", praised it as a \"thoroughly heartwarming salute to Disney\" and that he hasn't \"fallen so head over heels with the look, feel, and play of a third-person platformer since the original \"Banjo-Kazooie\"\". G4TV also named it \"Best Wii Game.\", Giant Bomb gave a Negative review with 2/5 stars saying \"Nevermind these heightened expectations, though: even on its own merits, Epic Mickey is a platformer that feels about a generation behind, though one with just enough flashes of inspiration to keep you constantly aware of its wasted potential\".\n\nIn its opening weekend, \"Epic Mickey\" failed to reach the UK Top 40 and even the Wii Top 10 sales charts after its November 26 UK release. On November 30, 2010, the release date in North America, the game was completely sold out on the Disney Store website by the afternoon. The game sold 1.3 million copies its first month. , the game sold 2 million copies in North America and Europe combined.\n\nOn August 27, 2011, Destructoid posted an article that speculated that a sequel, \"Epic Mickey 2\", is in development and showed possible box art for the game. These rumours were further encouraged when Disney France and Warren Spector invited the French media to an \"epic project\" taking place on March 27, 2012. Nintendo Power magazine also commented on the rumour, stating that their April 2012 issue would include a \"top-secret\" title preview, with the preview for the issue showing a cropped down picture of Oswald The Lucky Rabbit. Gametrailers.com also stated that their March 22, 2012 episode would include a \"world-exclusive preview of Warren Spector's new epic adventure\" and that it would be \"notably significant\". Warren Spector himself also commented on the game's development, revealing that he had \"a team of over 700 people working on the sequel\". Following this, on March 20, 2012 the official French Nintendo magazine posted a comment on Twitter, revealing that Disney had plans to create a companion to the main sequel for the 3DS, under the name \"\".\n\nWarren Spector, on March 21, 2012, officially confirmed the rumours, revealing the sequel's title to be \"Epic Mickey: Power of Two\". Spector also directly addressed the camera issues that reviewers criticised in the first game, stating that \"They'll be working on it until the day we ship the second game. (There have been) over 1,000 specific changes made to the camera. Our goal is that you will not have to touch the manual camera controls even once to play through the main story path of this game.\" Spector also revealed that the game was to include voice acting and musical numbers, both of which were absent in the first game. Spector said: \"I'm such a geek about musicals, I love the co-op and next-gen stuff, but for me, when a character breaks into song, which they do on a regular basis in this game, it's magic.\" Spector also commented on the sequel's co-op features, stating that: \"It's drop-in, drop-out co-op, you can sit down at any time with a friend who is playing as Mickey, and you can take control of Oswald. If you're playing as a single player, Oswald will be there every second of the game. He's not just a multiplayer character. He's a helper, whether you're playing alone or with a friend or family member.\" Wasteland itself will feature old areas ruined by earthquakes and other natural disasters, as well as new areas such as one based on Disneyland's Frontierland.\n\nIt was released on Wii, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation Vita, and Wii U. Due to the sequel's poor sales, which fared even worse than its predecessor, Disney consequently closed down Junction Point and ended all potential for future titles and Disney Interactive Studios shut down in 2016.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4950262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4950262", "title": "Ethnotaxonomy", "text": "Ethnotaxonomy\n\nThe term ethnotaxonomy refers either to that subdiscipline within ethnology which studies the taxonomic systems defined and used by individual ethnic groups, or to the operative individual taxonomy itself, which is the object of the ethnologist's immediate study.\n\nFor example, in many West African languages, the perceptual world of color is classified into the principal categories \"Red,\" \"White,\" and \"Black\" (finer gradations being secondary). The range of wavelengths that an English-speaker calls \"blue\" would be a subcategory of \"Black.\"\n\nThe set of categories of familial relationships evinced by the ethnic group's kinship system is another ethnotaxonomy. An example of this might be the Hawaiian kinship system, where all members of a generation of the same sex are referred to by a single term. Both the relationships termed \"mother\" and \"aunt\" in English fall into the same taxon \"Mother-Aunt\". This does not mean that the users of this taxonomy are confused about the concept \"Birth-Mother,\" only that it is a subcategory.\n\nConversely, an ethnotaxonomy such as the Sudanese kinship system or that used in ancient Rome, where no two relationships have the same denotation, may show much more granularity than the English system. Thus the relationship called \"aunt\" in English is not fundamental in Latin, but either \"amita\" \"Father's Sister\" or \"matertera\" \"Mother's Sister\" must be chosen. Latin and Sudanese are called a \"descriptive systems,\" and Hawaiian is called a \"classificatory\" system, but this terminology is English-centered (see Lewis H. Morgan), the difference being one of degree, rather than kind.\n\nCategories of plants, \"Useful\" and \"Harmful,\" etc., are yet another well-known example. Indeed, in recent years there has been a vogue usage of the term ethnotaxonomy limiting it to ethnobotany and ethnopharmacology, because of the \"rediscovery\" of the medicinal and commercial value of plants disclosed by examining the botanical ethnotaxonomies of lesser-known cultures.\n\n"}

{"id": "54062262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54062262", "title": "Far Cry 5", "text": "Far Cry 5\n\nFar Cry 5 is an action-adventure first-person shooter video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and Ubisoft Toronto and published by Ubisoft for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It is the standalone successor to the 2014 video game \"Far Cry 4\", and the fifth main installment in the \"Far Cry\" series. The game was released on March 27, 2018.\n\nThe game takes place in Hope County, a fictional region of Montana, USA. The main story revolves around the Project at Eden's Gate, a doomsday cult that rules the land under the guise of its charismatic leader, Joseph Seed. Players control an unnamed junior deputy sheriff who becomes trapped in Hope County, and must work alongside factions of a resistance to liberate the county from the despotic rule of the Seeds and Eden's Gate. Gameplay focuses on combat and exploration; players battle enemy soldiers and dangerous wildlife using a wide array of weapons. The game features many elements found in role-playing games, such as a branching storyline and side quests. The game also features a map editor, a co-operative multiplayer mode, and a competitive multiplayer mode.\n\nAnnounced in early 2017, development on \"Far Cry 5\" was extensive. The team explored several concepts before settling on an American location. The game was heavily inspired by several socio-political events in modern history, such as the Cold War and the September 11 attacks. The development team sought to capture the despondent social climate after the events and re-purpose it for the game. Developed and published solely by Ubisoft, its competitive multiplayer mode was also created in-house, with the company's worldwide studios gaining more creative input for \"Far Cry 5\".\n\n\"Far Cry 5\" was met with mostly positive critical reception upon release, although was the subject of controversy after being announced alongside a period of heightened political conflicts. Critics praised the open world design, visuals, and soundtrack, but directed criticisms towards its story and some of the characters. The game was a commercial success and became the fastest-selling title in the franchise, grossing over $310 million in its first week of sales. Several downloadable content packs have been released.\n\nSimilar to its predecessors, \"Far Cry 5\" is an action-adventure first-person shooter set in an open world environment which the player can explore freely on foot or via various vehicles. Unlike previous titles in the series where the player takes on the role of a set character, the game gives the player the opportunity to customize their character's appearance. The player has a variety of ranged and explosive weapons to fight against enemies, with the game placing a renewed emphasis on close-quarters combat compared to previous \"Far Cry\" titles by introducing a wider range of melee weapons. In addition, \"Far Cry 5\" features a new weapons ballistics system that includes elements like a bullet dropping over a distance to make it more realistic.\n\nCreative director Dan Hay described the design of the open world as being modeled on the outposts from previous titles in the \"Far Cry\" series. These outposts represented a small section of the map occupied by enemy forces and the player was tasked with liberating them by killing or neutralizing the enemy presence. The outposts were designed with multiple approaches for the player to take and it was this element that the development team tried to recreate in the wider game world of \"Far Cry 5\". The player is dropped into the game world with little context, direction or objective markers and is instead required to navigate the world on their own. Hay expressed a desire to create what he termed the \"anecdote factory\", a game where two players could venture out from the same point in opposite directions and have completely different experiences that they would then share with one another anecdotally. To assist with this, most of the game world is accessible to the player after completing the game's introductory missions and they are free to advance through these areas as they choose; by comparison, previous titles in the series gradually opened up the game world to the player with story missions guiding their progress through open areas. Completing actions within a region earns the player \"Resistance Points\" which cumulate to trigger major story events. These Resistance Points also contribute to the \"Resistance Meter\", which divides each region into three tiers represents the region's relative level of difficulty. For example, on entering a region for the first time, the player will encounter basic enemies; however, as the Resistance Meter increases, the player will run into a wider variety of enemy archetypes, culminating in aerial patrols and airborne assaults.\n\nThe game also features a recruitment system in which the player can recruit locals in the county to fight alongside them similar to the \"Buddy\" system used in \"Far Cry 2\" or the \"Guns for Hire\" system in \"Far Cry 4\". In this Guns for Hire system, the player can recruit locals to join their cause at which point they will fight alongside the player. In addition to these Guns for Hire, the game also includes \"Specialists\" or non-playable characters with their own unique skills and personalities. The recruitment system replaces the beacon system used in previous titles. For example, \"Far Cry 3\" featured radio towers and \"Far Cry 4\" featured bell towers that the player had to climb in order to open up parts of the map and various activities in the region. \"Far Cry 5\" removed this system and instead relies on the player forging relationships with other characters to discover story missions, events and other characters.\n\nThe player has the ability to tame wild animals through the Specialists, which is based on a system that was previously introduced to the series in \"Far Cry Primal\". The tamed wildlife will assist the player in combat and follow the player's orders. Different wildlife have different combat patterns. A fishing mechanic was also introduced and a variety of fish can be caught. The campaign can be played individually or with a partner through the game's cooperative multiplayer mode known as \"Friends for Hire\".\n\n\"Far Cry Arcade\" allows players to build and share small maps that have single player, two-player cooperative, and multiplayer objectives. Players are able to construct maps using assets from \"Far Cry 5\" as well as \"Far Cry 4\", \"Far Cry Primal\", \"Watch Dogs\", \"\", and \"\". While a separate mode from the main game, the \"Arcade\" mode can also be accessed from arcade cabinets scattered around the game's map; successfully completing these maps can earn in-game money and other rewards for the main campaign.\n\nThe game is set in the fictional Hope County, Montana, where a preacher named Joseph Seed (portrayed by Greg Bryk) has risen to prominence. Seed believes that he has been chosen by God to protect the people of Hope County from \"the Collapse\", a global catastrophe that will see the collapse of society, and to this end has established a congregation called the Project at Eden's Gate. Ostensibly, this is to fulfill his mission of leading the people to salvation; in reality, Seed is a radical preacher and Eden's Gate is a militaristic doomsday cult. Under his rule, Eden's Gate has used both coercion and violence to forcibly convert the residents of Hope County, and intimidation to keep them from contacting the outside world for help. Seed has assumed the title of \"the Father\" and maintains control over Hope County with the aid of the Heralds: Jacob, \"the Soldier\" (Mark Pellegrino), a former United States Army sniper and Joseph's older brother who oversees the training and deployment of the cult's armed soldiers; John, \"the Baptist\" (Seamus Dever), Joseph's younger brother and a lawyer who has been able to acquire much of the land in Hope County for Eden's Gate and who leads the forcible conversion of residents; and Rachel Jessop, also known as Faith or \"the Siren\" (Jenessa Grant), a botanist who acts as a pacifist to bring the people to trust in Joseph, but uses a powerful hallucinogen called Bliss to run forced labour camps for residents who resist the cult. The Heralds have converted a series of decommissioned missile silos into fortified bunkers where they intend to wait out \"the Collapse\" with the cult's followers.\n\nThe player takes on the role of a rookie sheriff's deputy—referred to as \"the Deputy\"—who is part of a task force sent to arrest Seed. The residents of Hope County opposed to Seed include a cast of characters who join the fight with motives ranging from altruism to revenge, profit and boredom. They are aided by Richard \"Dutch\" Roosevelt (John Tench), a local survivalist with a deep distrust of government and a history of anti-social behaviour. Characters from the \"Far Cry\" series who return in \"Far Cry 5\" include Hurk Drubman, Jr. (Dylan Taylor), a dim-witted though well-intentioned redneck party boy with a love of high-powered explosives; and Willis Huntley (Alain Goulem), a sociopathic CIA agent and self-proclaimed \"patriot bastard\" in the habit of recruiting civilians for dangerous clandestine missions.\n\nA joint operation between the United States Marshals and the county sheriff's department—consisting of Deputy Marshal Cameron Burke (Doug Hutchison), Sheriff Earl Whitehorse (Christopher Heyerdahl) and his deputies Joey Hudson (Luisa D'Oliveira), Staci Pratt (Julian Bailey) and the player character, an unnamed junior Deputy—arrive at an Eden's Gate church to detain Joseph Seed with a federal arrest warrant on charges of kidnapping with the intent to harm. Although Joseph offers no resistance, he claims that God will not allow him to be taken. As he is escorted away, cult members attack the task force and cause their helicopter to crash. Joseph escapes and commands the cult to capture the task force members.\n\nThe Deputy survives and escapes with the help of Dutch, who explains that the cult has interpreted the attempt to arrest Joseph as the fulfillment of his prophecies. Believing the end of the world is upon them, they have begun \"the Reaping\", a concentrated effort to purge Hope County of non-believers and gather all material needs. As the county is now cut off from the outside world, Dutch tasks the Deputy with contacting the fledgling resistance scattered throughout Hope County to gather allies, rescue the task force and dismantle the cult's operations to erode the influence of Joseph and the Heralds. Although the Heralds focus their efforts in stopping the Deputy, they maintain an interest in recruiting them to their cause. According to the prophecy from verses cited from the Book of Revelation, the Deputy eliminates in order, Jacob, John, and finally Faith, but can choose to remove each Herald in any order.\n\nThe Deputy arrives in the Whitetail Mountains to find the Whitetail Militia already at war with Joseph's older brother Jacob. Jacob recruits and trains the cult's members and keeps an indoctrinated Deputy Pratt captive. As part of their training, Jacob mentally conditions cult recruits with The Platters' song \"Only You (And You Alone)\", which he uses to trigger an altered state of consciousness in the recruits and carry out his commands. Jacob subjects the Deputy to the same conditioning and successfully breaks them. He has the Deputy kill militia leader Eli Palmer to cripple the resistance. The surviving militia hold Jacob responsible and the Deputy confronts him in the mountains. As he dies, Jacob reflects on how empires rise and fall, and predicts that America will suffer the same fate if it is not prepared. The Deputy retrieves Jacob's bunker key, rescues Pratt and floods the bunker.\n\nJoseph's younger brother John lures the Deputy to Holland Valley by broadcasting a message showing Hudson as his captive. John indoctrinates residents to the cult's beliefs by subjecting them to a forced baptism to \"cleanse\" them, tattooing their \"sins\" onto their bodies, and carving out the marked skin as part of their \"atonement\". John captures the Deputy and concludes that their sin is Wrath. When the Deputy escapes, John retaliates by taking over the town of Fall's End where he forces the Deputy to confront him and atone for their sins. A counterattack by the local Resistance prompts John to flee, leading to the Deputy engaging him in an aerial dogfight and mortally wounding him. As he lays dying, John remarks that the Deputy will not save anyone and asserts that Joseph is right. The Deputy rescues Hudson and the captive survivors and destroys John's bunker.\n\nFaith, a collaborator and \"sister\" of the Seeds, oversees the production of Bliss in Henbane River. The hallucinatory effects of Bliss puts its victims in a trance-like state and staying under its influence for too long makes them vulnerable to Faith's hypnotic manipulation. The Deputy reunites with Whitehorse and joins the Cougars, based in the Hope County Jail. Whitehorse informs the Deputy that Burke has been captured and is now under the influence of the Bliss. The Deputy repeatedly encounters Faith, who attempts to persuade the Deputy to join her and live in paradise. The Deputy resists her and rescues Burke, unaware that he has been hypnotized. Burke opens the jail to Eden's Gate and kills himself. The Cougars suffer heavy losses repelling the cult and Whitehorse is captured. The Deputy kills Faith, and she warns them that Joseph is right about the end of the world, but the Deputy will decide what happens in the end. The Deputy rescues Whitehorse from Faith's bunker and destroys the production of Bliss.\n\nKilling his Heralds prompts Joseph to call the Deputy for a final confrontation at his church. He has captured the Deputy's allies from the resistance groups, hypnotized them with Bliss and is holding Whitehorse, Hudson and Pratt hostage. Joseph offers the Deputy the option of walking away with their friends unharmed on the condition that they leave him and Eden's Gate alone.\n\nIf the Deputy decides to walk away, Joseph forgives them and enters the church with the Deputy's hypnotized allies. The Deputy, Whitehorse, Pratt and Hudson leave in a truck, and Whitehorse assures them that they will return with the National Guard to help liberate Hope County from the cult. Whitehorse turns on the radio and \"Only You\" plays, triggering Jacob's brainwashing. The Deputy is once again put into a trance and the screen cuts to black.\n\nIf the Deputy chooses to resist, Joseph forces the Deputy to fight and revive their hypnotized friends. Radio broadcasts throughout the game have suggested that the world outside Hope County is spiraling into chaos and a nuclear war is imminent. These fears are realized when Joseph is apprehended and a nuclear bomb explodes in the distance. The Deputy, Whitehorse, Pratt and Hudson flee with the captured Joseph to Dutch's bunker. They crash their truck into a tree, which kills Whitehorse, Pratt, and Hudson. A freed Joseph carries the unconscious Deputy to the bunker; the Deputy awakens handcuffed to a bed with Dutch unconscious, but still breathing, incapacitated by Joseph. Joseph laments the loss of his family and land, and asserts this is \"the Collapse\" that he had prophesied. He tells the Deputy that with the loss of his family, that they are all he has left and that they are family now.\n\nA secret ending can be found at the beginning of the game. The Deputy decides to not arrest Joseph during their first encounter. Whitehorse, who was against apprehending him head-on because of the probability of being ambushed and killed, lowers Joseph's hands and orders the group to leave. Despite Burke's protests, Whitehorse asserts that it is \"better to leave well enough alone\" and that no one would leave alive if they arrested Joseph.\n\nPrior to the game's release, Ubisoft announced to release three episodes of downloadable content titled \"Hours of Darkness\", \"Lost on Mars\" and \"Dead Living Zombies\". Each episode tells a stand-alone story focusing on a secondary character from the main campaign.\n\n\"Hours of Darkness\" takes place during the height of the Vietnam War. The player takes on the role of Wendell Redler, a door gunner known by the call-sign Python 2-5. Python's helicopter is shot down while on a mission to scout the positions of North Vietnamese forces in a wide jungle valley. He is taken captive by the North Vietnamese Army, but escapes during an airstrike. He recovers a radio from the downed helicopter and is instructed to cross the valley to an extraction point. What started as a reconnaissance mission becomes a rescue mission as Python locates his squadmates Joker, Moses and Yokel. As he ventures through enemy territory, Python frees South Vietnamese prisoners of war, sabotages anti-aircraft batteries, kills North Vietnamese commanders and survives the spraying of Agent Orange. When they arrive at the extraction point, Python and his squadmates fight off waves of soldiers as they wait for the helicopters. The survivors are safely extracted and flown out of the valley.\n\n\"Lost on Mars\" focuses on Nick Rye. Nick is teleported to Mars where he meets the disembodied head of Hurk Drubman, Jr. Hurk reveals that he had Nick teleported for a mission to save Earth after Hurk himself failed. Nick is introduced to ANNE, a millennia-old artificial intelligence who warns that a hostile alien race called the Arachnids are putting together the final preparations for an invasion of Earth. With no way to get home, Nick is enlisted to restore power to ANNE, allowing her to build her defences and thwart the invasion. Hurk is given a robotic body to assist in the mission and asks Nick to locate his missing body parts. Nick grows suspicious of ANNE's intentions while experiencing a series of apocalyptic visions involving his newborn daughter and Hope County. The two manage to fully restore power to ANNE, but doing so allows her to ready her own invasion of earth as she sees humans as inferior lifeforms. They fight both her robots and clones of Hurk made from his re-assembled body. They successfully shut ANNE down at the expense of Hurk's body. Nick and the robotic Hurk return to Earth, where they are celebrated as heroes.\n\n\"Dead Living Zombies\" follows Guy Marvel, an auteur film director who has a reputation for being impossible to work with. The style and tone of \"Dead Living Zombies\" is very different to the main story campaign and other downloadable content episodes, relying on parody, meta-humour and irreverence over plot. It recounts Marvel's career and how he wound up in Montana during the Eden's Gate incident. The early days of Marvel's career see him accosting established directors with unsolicited pitches for zombie films. While the directors try to see the merits of his projects, it quickly becomes apparent that they are gratuitously violent with little plot or character development and the directors lose interest. Marvel tries to adapt his pitches based on the feedback he receives, but is told that his films should \"say something about society\". He becomes frustrated when a director tries to seize creative control over pitch for a global warming-themed zombie film. Realizing that he has been approaching the wrong kind of director, he finds some success when a studio picks up his idea for a summer blockbuster called \"The Fast and the Fiendish\" and he receives his first screenwriting credit. His final pitch is for \"Laboratory of the Dead\", which is positively received by a director who loves everything the others hated about Marvel's films. Marvel admits that he has no experience directing films and is offered a job directing \"\" in Hope County.\n\nThe game was developed by Ubisoft Montreal and Ubisoft Toronto with Ubisoft Kiev, Ubisoft Shanghai and Ubisoft Reflections offering assistance. Dan Hay, who served as lead producer for \"Far Cry 3\", was the lead director, with writing led by Drew Holmes, who had previously worked on \"BioShock Infinite\" and its downloadable content. The game continue the series' practice of using the Dunia Engine, a modified version of the CryEngine. The team chose Montana as the game's setting, as the state lies on the frontier of the United States. To create a realistic environment, the development team visited Montana for fourteen days to collect information regarding its biomes, environment, and the \"self-reliant\" nature of the locals, who do not want any authority or outsider to intervene in their life. The development team had previously carried out a similar research excursion to Nepal during development of \"Far Cry 4\". As the development team was no longer satisfied with having one core antagonist in each game, the cast of antagonists was significantly expanded.\n\nAfter the release of \"Far Cry Primal\" in 2016, Ubisoft stated that the next \"Far Cry\" title will take more development time and would not be released in 2017. \"Far Cry 5\" was announced by Ubisoft during the company's financial call, alongside two other major titles, \"The Crew 2\" and \"Assassin's Creed Origins\", which were released in fiscal year 2018. Ubisoft released several teaser trailers and the game's cover art ahead of the game's official reveal on May 26, 2017. The game was released on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One with support for PlayStation 4 Pro and Xbox One X. Free skin packs were made available for PlayStation 4 players at launch due to a marketing deal between Sony Interactive Entertainment and Ubisoft. Though the game was initially set for release on February 27, 2018, Ubisoft pushed the date back a month to March 27, 2018.\n\nThe setting and the tone of the game originated from separatism. According to Hay, he often felt unsafe when he was young because of the conflicts between the two superpowers during the Cold War. This manifested in the twenty-first century in the form of frequent terrorist attacks such as the September 11 attacks, and financial problems such as the subprime mortgage crisis and in turn caused people to become increasingly protective as they questioned the government. Ultimately the concept of the \"global village\" began to collapse, which sets the theme of the game and prompted the team to write a story that features a doomsday cult as the game's main antagonist. Hay started writing the story in late 2014; in February 2016, he investigated the details of the occupation and standoff of a wildlife refuge in Oregon, as he wanted to look for evidence that can show the rise of separatism. To create a memorable story, the characters in the game were designed to have different views and opinions on important events, and different ideologies. Despite the dark theme, the team wanted to ensure that the game is still fun and entertaining to play. Therefore, the team implemented a large arsenal of weapons and open-ended gameplay possibilities for players to use.\n\nThe music in the game was written and composed by Dan Romer. According to audio director Tony Gronick, the team desired to have music in the background through much of the game world, but want it to reflect on the nature of the cult, so that the player would be experiencing the cult's messaging throughout the game and tie it to the narrative. To do this, they create hymn-like gospel music, but with lyrics that described the cult's end-of-the-world teachings. Further, extending on the idea of multiple antagonists, the style of the music shifts as the player enters regions of the world controlled by the different cult members, from country to glam rock to industrial music, representing how the hymns of Joseph Seed evolve under his siblings' personal preferences. The game also uses licensed music tracks when the player drives in vehicles, with the type of music played similarly influenced by the area they are in. The ambient/post-rock band, Hammock, used some of the songs Romer produced for the game and reinterpreted them.\nThis resulted in a multi-volume soundtrack release, which consists of the original soundtrack and the three-parter \"Far Cry 5 Presents\" series. \"Far Cry 5 Presents\" is a thematic compilation of the additional music used in the game: \"Into the Flames\" collects cult songs written by Romer and performed by various artists, \"When the World Falls\" is a choir version of those songs, and \"We Will Rise Again\" is their ambient reinterpretations by Hammock.\n\nCoinciding with the release of the game, Ubisoft released a live action short film called \"Inside Eden's Gate\". The film serves as a prologue to the events of the game, and follows three filmmakers as they travel across Hope County. They meet Mark and his sister, Faith who is in the game being taken in by the Eden's Gate cult. It stars Greg Bryk and Kyle Gallner. Ubisoft first made the film available on Amazon Prime, before releasing it on YouTube on April 4.\n\n\"Far Cry 5\" received \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic.\n\nDaemon Hatfield of IGN gave it a 8.9 rating, saying \"\"Far Cry 5\" is another wide-open playground with all the necessary ingredients for causing a real ruckus: loads of enemies and allies, temperamental wildlife, and plenty of explosions.\" \"Polygon\" gave the game 6.5 of 10 possible points, stating \"It’s a shame that \"Far Cry 5\" is propped up by a weak story with bland characters, because behind the plot is an open world filled with what \"Far Cry\" as a series does best.\"\n\nThe game's ending polarized critical opinion. Should the player choose \"resist\" when prompted—an ending regarded by Ubisoft to be canonical—the game depicts a series of nuclear explosions that destroy civilization. Critics argued that this ending invalidated the player's actions by rendering them meaningless, while supporters appreciated the game's willingness to follow through with a bleak ending and that it reflected the theme of individual disempowerment in times of socio-political upheaval.\n\n\"Far Cry 5\" became the fastest-selling title in the history of the franchise, more than doubling the sales of \"Far Cry 4\". It was the second-biggest launch of an Ubisoft title, behind \"Tom Clancy's The Division\", grossing $310 million in its first week of sales. The PlayStation 4 version sold 75,474 copies within its first week on sale in Japan, placing it at number two on the all format sales chart.\n\n\"Far Cry 5\"s announcement in May 2017 came at a time of heightened political and ideological conflict around the world, namely as a result of the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States and the onset of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union. Many journalists opined that \"Far Cry 5\"s setting and narrative concept, involving themes of religious fanaticism and the emergence of far-right political movements within the borders of the United States—as opposed to the more exotic locales depicted in other \"Far Cry\" titles—would likely make the game highly controversial. These journalists noted that due to the long development cycle, it was unlikely that Ubisoft intentionally designed the game's narrative around the political climate at the time of the announcement, adding that Ubisoft had been careful to downplay any perceived connections to then-current real world events. Responding to the criticism, game director Dan Hay revealed that the story was written to discuss the consequences of beliefs and ideologies being taken to their most extreme form rather than as a response to a particular political event. Hay stated they had come to setting the game around a cult in Montana as they felt Montana reflected a remote frontier most people were not aware of, comparable to their other \"Far Cry\" game settings, and that after visiting the state, found that Montana was a place \"where people go to be alone, where they don't want to be messed with\", further resonating with past \"Far Cry\" themes. However, after three years of development, Hay said: \"we could have never imagined, and to be honest I wouldn't have wanted to... that in some ways, it's echoing out in the real world.\"\n\nFollowing its announcement, \"Far Cry 5\" was the subject of an online petition lodged at Change.org by individuals objecting to what they called the portrayal of American Christians as villains and calling for the game's antagonists to be recast. The petition suggested Muslims, inner-city gang members, and other non-white antagonists as possible replacements. The petition also suggested changing the game's setting to Canada. The petition itself was criticized by industry commentators who highlighted the game's exploration of its themes as being necessary in the contemporary social and political climate, and pointed to video gaming as a medium for social commentary. Some publications also questioned the authenticity of the petition, suggesting that it may have been intended as satire. Conversely, after the game's release, some outlets criticized it for trying to be inoffensive and apolitical rather than directly engaging with contemporary political issues. \"Polygon\"s Ben Kuchera described the game as a \"defiantly inoffensive mess\" which \"wants to appeal to everyone, but ultimately says nothing.\" William Hughes writing for \"The A.V. Club\" disparagingly described the villains as an \"easily digestible evil\" deliberately crafted so as not to offend gamers of any political persuasion.\n"}

The machine consists of a solid glass cylinder, typically around in diameter and in length, mounted to the end of a rotating or reciprocating arm. The arm repeatedly and rapidly draws the glass across the surface of the leather, with significant downward pressure, as the operator moves the leather underneath the arm.\n\nThe repeated stroking of the leather smooths and compresses the surface and raises various color tones. Heat generated by friction during the glazing process can darken and harden the aniline finish of the leather, and can raise oils in the leather to the surface. Because no pigment is used, the porous structure of the leather remains visible, providing a depth to its appearance. The operator of the glazing jack can control the surface finish by varying the pressure of the tool and the number of strokes applied. Similarly to glazing, a copper or glass tool can be drawn across the leather by hand to create \"sleeked\" and \"glassed\" finishes, respectively.\n\nBecause jacking leather is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process, it is often reserved for more expensive or exotic leathers, such as reptile leathers.\n"}
{"id": "10870829", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10870829", "title": "Hanfu movement", "text": "Hanfu movement\n\nThe Hanfu movement () is a social movement that has developed in China since the beginning of the 21st century. In 2003, supporters of Han revivalism launched the website \"Hanwang\" (, \"Han Network\") to promote \"traditional\" Han clothing and Han supremacist agenda. Participants revitalize their utopian vision of the authentic “Great Han” and corresponding “real China” through dress, reinvented Confucian ritual and anti-foreign sentiment. They seek to restore and stress the purity and superiority of \"traditional Chinese culture\" through the promotion of the wearing of the \"hanfu\" which they claim to be the \"traditional ethnic clothing\" of the majority Han Chinese ethnic group. While some Hanfu enthusiasts believe that the issue of Han clothing cannot be separated from the larger issue of racial identity and political power in China, some consider most supporters wear the style to show their appreciation for Chinese culture or just for fashion, without caring about the Han nationalism publicised by some leaders of the Hanfu movement.\n\nAccording to \"Asia Times Online,\" the Hanfu movement may have begun around 2003. Wang Letian from Zhengzhou, China, publicly wore Hanfu. Wang and his followers inspired others to reflect on the cultural identity of Han Chinese. They organized the Hanfu movement as an initiative in a broader effort to revive and preserve the Han Chinese identity.\n\nAccording to James Leibold, an associate professor in Chinese politics and Asian studies at La Trobe University, there were advocates of Han revivalism launched a website known as \"Han Network\" to promote \"traditional\" Han clothing and the Han supremacist agenda in 2003. The guiding principles behind the website is described as \"Han-centrism\", the belief in \"the paramount importance of racial righteousness and the upholding of the Han race's position by defending on this core philosophy\", the constitution asserts that \"Han culture is the world's most advanced and its race is one of the strongest and most prosperous\". Some pioneers of the movement who promote Han clothing and Han supremacist agenda admitted that the issue of Han clothing cannot be separated from the larger issue of racial identity and political power in China. Moreover, Leibold also mentioned that: \"one would be mistaken in believing that all Hanfu supporters share the political agenda embedded in the Hanwang constitution. Rather, the movement encompasses a very diverse group of individuals who find different sorts of meaning and enjoyment in the category of Han.\"\n\nThe Hanfu movement has been controversial since its initiation. While supporters often applaud its reviving of Han culture, some others criticize its exclusiveness. The Han Chinese society as a whole has not accepted revival of wearing Hanfu for daily wear. People who wear Hanfu in public, rather than what is now the more common western dress, are often considered eccentric.\n\nHanfu enthusiasts often hold events to encourage the public to wear this traditional clothing. Major events in recent years include Guan Li's and Ji Li's (Chinese coming of age ceremonies). Activists in this movement also wear Hanfu in numerous public and private ceremonies.\n\nDuring an interview, a pioneer of the movement who promote Han clothing and Han supremacist agenda with other supporters admitted that the issue of Han clothing cannot be separated from the larger issue of racial identity and political power in China. However, some supporters consider most of them wear the style to show their appreciation for Chinese culture or just for fashion, without caring about the Han nationalism publicised by some leaders of the Hanfu movement.\n\nLecturer of Macquarie University Kevin Carrico said: \"In this process, Han Clothing made the transition from a fantastic invented tradition to a distant image on a screen to a physical reality in the streets of China, in which one could wrap and recognise oneself... the movement promotes a sacred tradition surrounding profane reality, declaring an aestheticised warfare on the dictatorship of the real.\" In 2011, an Hanfu enthusiast explained to Carrico his understand of nationalism:\n\nThe word \"Hanfu\" is not included in the authoritative dictionary of Standard Mandarin Chinese \"Contemporary Chinese Dictionary\" () and its modern definition was created by internet users around the year 2003.\n\nAccording to \"Dictionary of Old Chinese Clothing\" (), the term \"hanfu\" means \"dress of the Han people.\" It is a concept to distinguish Han people's dress from minority clothing. The term/concept of \"hanfu\" which is not commonly used in ancient times can be found in some historical records from Han, Tang, Song, Ming dynasties and the Republican era in China, yet there is no clear history indicating that there was any such apparel in existence under the name \"hanfu\".\n\nSupporters of the movement claim that hanfu's chief characteristics were symbolic of cultural moral and ethical values: \"the left collar covering the right represents the perfection of human culture on human nature and the overcoming of bodily forces by the spiritual power of ethical ritual teaching; the expansive cutting and board sleeve represents a moral, concordant relation between nature and human creative power; the use of the girdle to fasten the garment over the body represents the constraints of Han culture to limit human's desire that would incur amoral deed. In the Qing Dynasty, officials replaced the Hanfu with the costume of Manchu. Though many persons believe that the Qipao or Cheongsam is China's national costume, it is fairly modern.\n\nThe advocates of the movement believe the term \"hanfu\" refers to the vanished, pre-17th century historical clothing worn by the Han people, and the meaning of Hanfu in the movement is the same from what it was in the historical records, yet scholarly research indicates that the \"modern definition of Hanfu\" was created on Chinese-language, collaborative, web-based encyclopedia Baidu Baike and Chinese online platform \"“hanwang”\" by internet users.\n\nProfessor of Aichi University Zhou Xing () said that the so-called \"hanfu\", which is not commonly used in ancient times, refers to the traditional dress imagined by participants of hanfu movement.\n\nProfessor of China Youth University of Political Studies Zhang Xian () mentioned the \"modern definition of Hanfu\" is a concept publicized by advocates of the hanfu movement. Those advocates are mostly students, who created a non-academic, non-official standard of Hanfu that refers to the historical dress of the Han Chinese before the Qing dynasty and published it on Baidu Baike. He also argue that the promotion of Han clothing is a hollow \"totem\" which serves to mislead and deceive people about the underlining racist and regressive nature of the movement. By stressing the purity and superiority of Han culture, the Hanists are denigrating rather than reviving national consciousness, and thus represent a deviation and distortion from the mainstream of cultural nationalism in morder China.\n\nKevin Carrico pointed out that: \"in reality, modern hanfu is an invented style of dress that features broad sleeves, flowing robes, belted waists and vibrant colours. Its modern-day proponents claim it was the invention of the mythical Yellow Emperor and was worn for millennia by the Chinese people... Han Clothing made the transition from a fantastic invented tradition to a distant image on a screen to a physical reality in the streets of China, in which one could wrap and recognise oneself.\"\n\nIn the 21st century, Hanfu advocates argue that making Hanfu a national dress could unite the country, creating a cultural symbol for China, and a renewed tradition for future generations. But the movement's critics believe that this revival leans toward a narrow nationalism and that it is focused on looks rather than content. They fear that an effort to reject non-Hanfu dress could lead to a rejection of the West in terms beyond clothing style.\n\nOther critics note that Hanfu is the dress only of the Han people. The other 55 ethnic groups of China might not want to adopt it and give up their own dress.\n\nSome Hanfu advocates claim that the Manchu rulers of the Qing dynasty as single-mindedly dedicated to the destruction of the Han people and thus of China itself, has fundamentally transformed Chinese society and shifted its essence \"from civilisation to barbarism\". The real violence such as Yangzhou massacre during which a Manchu-led massacre devastated the city of Yangzhou, or the queue edict issued by the Manchu court imposing a particular hairstyle on Manchu and Han males alike, is combined with imaginary violence of the forcible erasure of Han Clothing. According to historians, the great majority of Han men were, in fact, free to continue to dress as they had during the Ming dynasty and the number of victims of Yangzhou massacre was highly exaggerated (the prefecture of Yangzhou had already been massacred twice by the Ming army before the city of Yangzhou was captured by the Qing army). Han Clothing devotees also claim that such \"uncivilised practices\" as spitting, line cutting, forcing others to drink alcohol, or corruption are the product of the \"Manchu taint\".\n\nAccording to historian Edward J.M. Rhoads, during the Qing dynasty, the Manchurian rulers required Manchu clothing only for Eight Banners members and Han men serving as government officials. Ordinary Han civilians were allowed to wear Han clothing, yet most of the Han civilian men voluntarily adopted Manchu clothing, as it represented what the elite were wearing. Throughout the Qing dynasty, most Han women continued to wear Han clothing and did not adopt Manchu women's clothing.\n\nConspiracy theories among Han Clothing Movement participants claim that there is a secret Manchu plan for restoration that has been underway from the start of the post-1978 reform era. They argue that Manchus secretly control every important party-state institution, such as the People’s Liberation Army, the Party Propaganda Department, the Ministry of Culture and especially the National Population and Family Planning Commission which is regarded as a stronghold of Manchu influence. They believe that its one-child policy is but \"an escalation of the long-term Manchu genocide that targets the Han people\", since they consider \" the one-child policy does not seem like something that one race would do to its own people\".\n\nIn February 2007, advocates of Hanfu submitted a proposal to the Chinese Olympic Committee to have it be the official clothing of the Chinese team in the 2008 Summer Olympics. The Chinese Olympic Committee rejected the proposal in April 2007.\n"}

It was extraordinarily successful on tour, starring Belasco, and earning a fortune for him. \"Hearts of Oaks\" first opened as a five act and six tableaux production at the Hamlin's Theatre in Chicago on November 17, 1879. The actress Chrystal Herne was named after the character her mother, Katherine Corcoran, portrayed in the piece.\n\nThe \"Daily Globe\", St. Paul, Minnesota – January 23, 1882\n\nThe \"Hearts of Oak\" company began an engagements of four performances at Leubrie’s theater last night. They may be congratulated. The company has been improved and strengthened since last season and is now equal to any presenting dramas of like character on the road. Jas. A Hearne (sic) who replaces Frank Aiken as Terry Dennison is a type of the simple sailor who sacrifices his own hopes for happiness of the object of his love. His acting is spirited and perfect in keeping with the character. The strength of his love for Chrystal shown in his discovery of the affection existing between her and Ruby is faithfully and strongly portrayed. And in the scene with his child, to whom he dares not make himself known, his acting is worthy of the warmest praise. The restraint that his noble self-denying heart places as the barrier between himself and the fruition of his parental love – the blind man casting off for others all hope for the future in the care for wife and child was true to nature in delineation though unfortunately too elevated for nature in fact. Harry Mainhal was an excellent Ruby Darell and Catherine Corcoran a charming and natural Chrystal. Mr. Charles H. Clark (Uncle Davy) and F. Chippendale (Owen Garroway) deserve favorable mention. The Latter in the supper scene aroused a storm of laughter by his vicarious hospitality and awkwardness\n\nThe \"Michigan Argonaut\", March, 1883\n\nHerne's \"Hearts of Oak\" drew one of the largest audiences of the season at the Opera House Wednesday evening. The play is well named for surely none, but Hearts of Oak could stand the intense strain which finally did cause one heart to break. The shipwrecked orphan-girl in real life, who marries her protector out of a sense of duty, though desperately in love with one more equal in age, is an extremely rare and interesting object. The company was good from first to last. Herne, as Terry Dennison, played an unexceptional role. Miss Corcoran as Crystal, did justice to a difficult part, and was especially effective in the scene in the grave with Ruby. Uncle Davy and Aunt Betsey, ably assisted by Owen Garroway, caused many cunning side scenes which served to relieve the deep melancholy that pervades the whole play. Little Maud Thompson as Little Crystal is a \"daisy,\" and we predict a brilliant future for her. The scenic effects, especially in the wreck scene, demand a large stage for their best representation, but were quite effective. The play does not follow the canons of Horace, having six acts. The interludes were rather too long, but the audience endured them each time with sweet anticipation of the treat to follow.\n\nTwo film adaptions were made:\n\n"}
{"id": "1723083", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1723083", "title": "Internal communications", "text": "Internal communications\n\nInternal communications (IC) is the function responsible for effective communications among participants within an organization. The scope of the function varies by organization and practitioner, from producing and delivering messages and campaigns on behalf of management, to facilitating two-way dialogue and developing the communication skills of the organization's participants.\n\nModern understanding of internal communications is a field of its own and draws on the theory and practice of related professions, not least journalism, knowledge management, public relations (e.g., media relations), marketing and human resources, as well as wider organizational studies, communication theory, social psychology, sociology and political science.\n\nLarge industrial organizations have a long history of promoting pride and a sense of unity among the employees of the company, evidenced in the cultural productions of Victorian-era soap manufacturers as far apart as the UK's Lever Brothers (right) and the Larkin Soap Company of Buffalo, New York.\n\nInternal communications is fundamentally a management discipline, but as a discrete discipline of organizational theory it is correspondingly young. Stanford associate professor Alex Heron's \"Sharing Information with Employees\" (1943) is an outlier among texts which focus solely on the factors involved. Theorization in academic papers accelerated in the 1970s, but mainstream management texts mostly post-date 1990.\n\nWriting in 2013, Ruck and Yaxley explore how the discipline evolved from the days of employee publications in the late 19th century. As organisations became more complex, the impetus to communicate with employees grew and led to the emergence of an increasingly specialised discipline.\n\nThe purpose that a formally appointed IC manager or IC team will serve within a given organization will depend on the business context. In one, the IC function may perform the role of 'internal marketing' (i.e., attempting to win participants over to the management vision of the organization); in another, it might perform a 'logistical' service as channel manager; in a third, it might act principally as strategic adviser.\n\nThere is a practical distinction to make between managed communication and regular interactions among teams or between managers and subordinates. Minzberg talks about the fact that communicating is intrinsic to the work of a manager - especially so in an information society. Interpersonal communications in the workplace are explored by writers such as Phillip Clampitt.\n\nThere are a number of reasons why organisations should be concerned with internal communication. Employees are the heart and soul of an organization, thus it’s critical to pay attention to their needs. An engaged and committed employee work force increases and drives business results. Employee engagement encourages higher employee performance, results in lower turnover and offers competitive advantage. Even in a difficult economy, companies need to inspire and retain high performers.\n\nImportantly, there is commonly a legal requirement for organizations to communicate with their workers. In Europe, for example, the EU has made very specific provision about workers' rights to be informed and consulted with Directive 94/45/EC (Works Council).\n\nEffective internal communications is commonly understood by practitioners to improve employee engagement (see, for example, the UK government-sponsored Macleod Report) and therefore to add significant value to organizations on metrics from productivity to customer research.\n\nAs noted in Quirke (2008): \"Traditionally, internal communications has focused on the announcement of management conclusions and the packaging of management thinking into messages for mass distribution to the 'troops'\". Research indicates a limit to the value of this 'broadcasting' model of IC. Without feedback loops and harnessing the active involvement and mediation skills of frontline supervisors or team leaders, broadcasting tends to be more effective at influencing senior and middle managers than frontline employees - see, e.g., Larkin and Larkin (1994).\n\nAs the IC function matures within the organization, then, it may come to play a wider role in facilitating conversations \"upwards\", \"downwards\" and \"across\" the organization, \"per\" Stohl (1995). Organizations increasingly see IC as playing a role in external reputation management. Joep Cornelissen in his book \"Corporate Communications\" touches on the relationship between reputation and internal conversations. This trend reaches its full potential with the arrival of new 'norms' and customer expectations around social media, for example in the work of Scoble and Israel. Market researchers MORI have likewise highlighted the effects of employee advocacy on an organisation's external reputation.\n\nIC managers try to get senior leaders to think strategically about how management decisions can be perceived internally and externally. The focus of IC is often to ensure that employees can support a decision and understand how it impacts their work. An engaged employee is someone who is fully involved in, committed, and enthusiastic about his or her work. It’s the extent to which employees put discretionary effort into their work. Involvement of hearts as well as minds. The ability to work as a team across disciplines and functions. The understanding and commitment to achieving company goals and business context. Employee engagement speaks Engaged Employees Are More Productive to the level of trust in leadership, a belief that decisions are made in the best interests of the organization and its employees, and the level to which employees feel valued and appreciated. The more engaged, committed and inspired an employee is, the higher the employee performance, and the more impact on the bottom line.\n\nThere are two sides to strategy in internal communications. In the first instance there is the organization's strategy — what it hopes to achieve and how it plans to go about achieving it. That strategy will be supported and, to some extent, delivered through effective internal communications.\n\nIn this context internal communication can help on several different levels:\n\n\nSecondly, and more importantly, internal communications needs a strategy of its own. It should be positioned more than a simple plan of tactical interventions in support of business activities. The strategy should consider the following:\n\n\nThe strategy will inform the best way to organize effective communications.\n\nFive general modes of IC practice are itemised below, ranked loosely according to their position along a spectrum from \"tactical\" to \"strategic\" activities.\nFormal channels typically fall into one of four broad categories:\n\n\nInformal channels reflect the non-linear dynamics of a social network and can be as influential, if not more so, than official channels, often more likely to stimulate and create discussion and dialogue. The channels may manifest themselves via the rumour-mill, water-cooler conversations, social networking, graffiti, spoof newsletters, etc.\n\nOne of the key challenges any internal communicator will face is how to select the right channels - and the right mix of channels - for both the audience and the message. Bill Quirke offers a simplistic guide; See Weick for some theoretical grounds for this basic insight.\n\nThe practical considerations are:\n\nA typical large organisation IC function will be concerned to monitor and limit the \"quantity\" of information flowing through each internal channel, prioritising according to the relevance of a given message to the audience implicated in that channel, as well as the urgency and impact of the message. Such organisations typically face a risk that channels (such as intranet news, or email) are over-used for inappropriate, low value messages, causing vital audience groups to filter them out.\n\nIC teams will often (but not always) hold responsibility for the administration and development of several of the organisation's communications channels. The range of media available is wide - and growing fast with new electronic media. Initially, IC tends to focus on the existing resources of the organization, typically an intranet, email distributions, and newsletters.\n\nOne common element of channel development and administration involves managing supplier relationships - agencies external to the organization typically specialise in one main channel area, such as audiovisual, or print production.\n\nSending information down the line to local supervisors, expecting them to deliver it without any corruption, interpretation or deviation has long been the main focus of 'cascaded' internal communications (for example, UK guidance from The Industrial Society, now the Work Foundation, focused on giving managers very clear instructions about what to say and how to say it). However, in recent years thinking has evolved and literature now concentrates on empowering managers to facilitate discussion rather than cascade management of messages which will have little authority or impact. This is a particularly strong theme in the writing of TJ and Sandar Larkin. Clampitt (2005) lists three approaches managers use to communicate with their employees.\n\nEmployee communication is an important skill for all line managers, irrespective of their seniority. Like any skill it requires training and development. Often, organisations do not invest the appropriate amount of time and effort in developing managers' communications skills. Too often this leads to managers abdicating responsibility for communications to their 'internal communications department' and a lack of confidence in facilitating discussion in their teams. This raises debate around the following issues:\n\nFitzPatrick and Valskov argue that strong manager communication systems attempt to address five essential issues:\n\nSocial media is becoming increasingly discussed in the field of internal communication. However, there is little documented, academic evidence of where it is being used successfully as part of a planned campaign of employee communications, and it is often confused with digital media. There are case studies published on a number of commercial websites including www.simply-communicate.com and www.melcrum.com, and there is a useful chapter on the subject by Tracy Playle in Ruck's \"Exploring Internal Communication\".\n\nSince 2012, several communication technologies usually classified as workplace group chat apps or collaborative software have emerged.\n\nBasic IC services to an organization begin with editorial services - either fine-tuning messages drafted by participants in the organization, or drafting new material on their behalf. IC practitioners might simply correct basic grammar, etc., especially in organisations where many participants may be operating in their second or third language. Or they might re-work it to conform to house style or its branded equivalent, 'tone of voice'. The skillset involved relates closely to media professions such as journalism, copywriting and film or print production. Message design may be iterative, or involve a range of participants in an approvals process.\n\nIC practitioners may be seconded to a specific project team, to support the stages of the project that carry a communications or engagement component. Project communicators might produce a schedule of communication objectives and milestones for the project; a map of vital stakeholders (senior individuals or large groups / segments of the overall population); and a message framework to guide project participants towards a single, coherent message about their work. They might also contribute to the project's aggregate risks 'log' on the reputational risks, and work-up contingency plans covering unintended situations.\n\nMost writers on the subject of communications talk about the idea of change. Most intentional communication takes place with the aim of effecting some kind of change or another. However, many practitioners in internal communications make a distinction between change and transformation.\n\nDrawing on the work of writers such as William Bridges, practitioners talk of 'change' as the act of altering something within an organisation (such as the introduction of a new IT system or the closure of an office) and they describe 'transition' as the process through which an individual passes as part of the process of coping with change. The use of the two terms interchangeably causes some confusion. Communicators who specialise in change communications tend to be interested in behaviour change and will draw heavily on psychological models.\n\nThere are important contributions made to the debate about practice in this area by Herrero and Quike.\n\nOrganizations occasionally face unplanned reputational crises which can destroy brand value or even finish the organization. At such moments, the support of the internal constituency becomes especially valuable, as employees' friends and relatives seek their account of events, and as talented and motivated participants consider whether or not to remain with the organization.\n\nAs with media relations and PR, the role IC plays in a crisis can be decisive for the success or failure of an organization, as it responds to a critical challenge. Organizations with a mature IC function may have contingency planning in place, ready to be tailored to the particulars of the situation. They are also more likely to have 'well flexed', well-rehearsed line management communications capability, making crisis communications more effective. Less mature IC functions may find it difficult to bring senior leaders' attention to the internal audience, when critical stakeholders such as investors or customers appear more likely to desert the organization.\n\nAlthough unplanned and usually under-resourced, the quality of an IC function's response in a crisis often has a decisive impact in the maturing of an IC function within an organization. Effective responses bring IC up the list of priorities for senior leaders, following the crisis.\n\nIn recent years the practice of internal communications has professionalised.\n\nIn common with the Ulrich model for human resources practice, IC may be delivered via a 'business partnering' relationship, acting as adviser to a given function or unit on IC issues relevant to the delivery of their strategic plans and projects. As a representative of the audiences with a stake in the developments under discussion, this can be both an awkward and a privileged position to occupy, requiring skills of diplomacy and objectivity.\n\nThere is not yet a globally recognised internal communication qualification, though various training courses and formal qualifications have been established to create and maintain standards.\n\nIn the UK, the accreditation bodies representing the profession offer competing qualifications. The UK's Chartered Institute of Public Relations offers training and qualifications in internal communications including Diploma and Certificate courses. There are also postgraduate Diploma or Masters programmes in Internal Communications Management at Kingston University in London.\n\nIn Europe, related courses are available at the University of Lugano in Switzerland and Rotterdam School of Management in the Netherlands.\n\nIn Asia, internal communications is still a very nascent field with few specialists in more developed economies such as Singapore and Hong Kong, some accredited by the Singapore Business Advisors and Consultants Council.\n\nProfessional IC associations include the Institute of Internal Communication, the International Association of Business Communicators (IABC), and others. In 2013, IABC closed its Accredited Business Communicator qualification, but planned to launch a Certification Programme for Strategic Communicators in Autumn 2014.\n\nIC may variously be referred to as: employee communications, employee engagement, employee relations, internal marketing, company communications, staff communication. Responsibility for IC may sit within various established functions, including marketing, corporate communications, transformation, HR and the CEO office. Internal communications functions can require several skills, e.g.: writing, marketing, event organisation, web production, facilitation, advertising, stakeholder management, corporate social responsibility, branding and communications training.\n\n\n"}

During their stay, the students attend a local high school or secondary school and so become immersed in the cultural and completely proficient in the language of that country.\n\nBefore the teenage students depart their homeland they are prepared in a two day long total immersion Pre-departure Seminar to acquaint them with the rules of the programme and prepare them to adjust to a new culture. This is a most important aspect of their preparation and is crucial as the basis of a successful exchange programme. Once in the host country, the students are permanently supervised by a regional representative to help, assist and advise them during their stay.\n\nInto was formed in 1976 in Great Britain under the name of DLS as a simple sole proprietor company by John Fisher. This organization originally brought teenage students from Italy to the South of England on short term holiday language courses in Hastings, Eastbourne; Torbay and Edinburgh.\n\nIn 1986, the head office was moved to Germany and the name DLS was changed to Douglas Schüleraustausch (student exchanges) in Germany. Along with a new name came a new focus of the company which was to send students from the now headquarter country of Germany to the United States of America on academic year programmes. This being a successful concept, Douglas Schüleraustausch decided to focus on this activity and the German company decreased their activities in the language vacation field.\n\nIn 1991, a small organization called Inter Study Tours specializing in class/group trips wished to cease its activities. Douglas took over Into and it became Into-Douglas. The name Into was favoured for being easier to pronounce in multiple languages, stressing the international concept of the company. The Douglas logo design was gradually replaced in favour of the Into logo. In 1992, Into-Douglas became Into Student Exchanges.\n\nIn the same year, Into founded Into Holland and Into Denmark. In Denmark, the concept of a Returnee Network was picked up, in which students returning from abroad after their academic exchange remain active and involved in exchanges.\n\nIn 1993, Into started to widen their exchange programme destinations to Canada and Australia as alternatives to the US. In the same year Into Canada was founded, to be followed by Into Switzerland and Into Austria.\n\nIn 1995, Into began to offer inbound academic year programmes. This meant that now students from other countries could go on an academic year program in countries with Into offices. The first students to arrive on these programs were from Australia, Brazil and Finland, as well as students from Into countries to Into countries. Due to demand, the UK Company was renamed Into Education to handle all inbound students to the UK. This was followed by the formation of Into Education Ireland Ltd in 2014.\n\nAll Into offices followed the example of Into Denmark and began to develop a Returnee program whereby the students can still meet each other, stay in contact with each other and retain some involvement with exchange programmes.\n\nIn 2003, Into opened offices in Prague and Budapest. In 2009, offices in Norway, Sweden, Finland and Spain were established.\n\nIn 2010 Into started a Work and Travel, Work Practice and Volunteer programmes in the German office. Further Into offices opened in Norway and in 2016 Into opened Into-Trust exchanges in the Ukraine.\n\nNew programmes such as Boarding Schools in the US have been introduced.\n\n"}

Korea, beginning with Goguryeo, has been called \"a country of fortresses\"; almost 2,400 mountain fortress sites have been found in Korea.\n\nThere are numerous types of Korean fortresses, including \"sanseong\" (mountain fortress), \"eupseong\" (city fortress), \"pyeongjiseong\", \"gwanseong\", \"jangseong\", \"chaekseong\", and more.\n\nKorean fortresses were based on a stone culture and built using stones, and often incorporated natural mountainous terrain, and therefore were conceptually completely different compared to Chinese fortresses, which were based on an earth culture and built using bricks from earth. Korean fortresses were invented by Goguryeo and spread to Baekje and Silla, and then inherited and further developed by Goryeo and then Joseon.\n\nAlmost 2,400 mountain fortress sites have been found in Korea.\n\nGoguryeo fortress ruins have been found in about 170 sites to date, including in China; one of the most notable among them is Ansi Fortress, which successfully defended against Tang Taizong during the Goguryeo–Tang War. Goguryeo fortress ruins have also been found in present-day Mongolia.\n\nKorean-style fortresses can be found in Japan, which were constructed and supervised by immigrants of Baekje origin.\n\nHwaseong Fortress and Namhansanseong are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\n\n"}

The term covers a wide array of world languages (other than English), ranging from some of the world's largest and most influential languages, such as Chinese, Russian, Arabic, Hindi, Portuguese, Japanese, Persian, and Turkish, to smaller regional languages studied in the US mainly by area experts, such as Twi, spoken in West Africa, and Finnish.\n\nThe term arose out of a need to contrast the more commonly taught languages in US K-12 public education with those normally encountered only at university level, a great divide reflected both in the US textbook industry, which caters to the existing K-12 market by necessarily focusing on the \"Big Three,\" (Spanish, French and German) and in historical US government funding for foreign language education. (In fact, one Stanford University language educator has referred to LCTLs as the \"Less Commonly \"Funded\" Languages\".) To facilitate the development of instructional formats specifically for the low-enrollment languages at U.S. colleges/universities, the National Association of Self-Instructional Language Programs (NASILP) was established in the 1970s.\n\nAfter 9/11, US federal departments and agencies recognized the strategic importance of LCTLs such as Arabic and, as a result, have begun funding programs for LCTLs such as the National Flagship Language Initiative (NFLI) under the auspices of the National Security Education Program (NSEP). These programs have been developed to encourage growth in the teaching of less commonly taught languages critical to national security such as Arabic, Persian, Korean, Mandarin Chinese, and Russian.\n\nWithin the US academic/educational community, previously informal links among LCTL educators crystallized into the National Council of Less Commonly Taught Languages (or NCOLCTL), \"an umbrella organization for national associations and individuals interested in less commonly taught languages\" founded in 1990 and based at the Indiana University Bloomington.\n\nThe Council's mission is to increase the number of Americans who choose to learn one or more of the less commonly taught languages (LCTLs) as a means of enhancing cross-cultural communication among citizens of the United States . ... The Council seeks to improve the teaching and learning of these languages and to make them more generally available. The Council is the national voice for organizations and individuals who represent the teaching of these less commonly taught languages at both the collegiate and precollegiate level . ... The Council constitutes a national mechanism devoted to strengthening the less commonly taught language professions through enabling Council members to work toward \"shared solutions to common problems.\" The Council principally directs its efforts toward building a national architecture for the LCTL field and in making the field's resources easily accessible to language programs and individual learners around the United States.\n\nAnother active organization linking students and teachers of LCTLs is the LCTL project at CARLA, the Center for Advanced Research on Language Acquisition, at the University of Minnesota. The LCTL project maintains a large database of where LCTLs are taught in North American colleges/universities, k-12 schools, distance education, study abroad, and summer courses. With over 350 languages listed on the database, and approximately 3,000 schools, the database is updated daily.\n\nIn addition to the database, the LCTL project sponsors mailing lists for teachers of various LCTLs, royalty free graphics and sounds for language teachers, and a summer institute on developing material for LCTL teachers.<ref>LCTL project mailing lists. The general public may be interested in the list of volunteer experts who have expressed their willingness to answer email about their languages \n\nIn Europe, the term Lesser-Used Languages (LULs) is used by the European Union (EU) bureaucracy for languages \"other than\" the 24 \"official\" languages of the European Union: Bulgarian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Irish, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovak, Slovene, Spanish, and Swedish.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18933569", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18933569", "title": "Library science", "text": "Library science\n\nLibrary science (often termed library studies, bibliothecography, library economy) is an interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary field that applies the practices, perspectives, and tools of management, information technology, education, and other areas to libraries; the collection, organization, preservation, and dissemination of information resources; and the political economy of information. Martin Schrettinger, a Bavarian librarian, coined the discipline within his work (1808–1828) \"Versuch eines vollständigen Lehrbuchs der Bibliothek-Wissenschaft oder Anleitung zur vollkommenen Geschäftsführung eines Bibliothekars\". Rather than classifying information based on nature-oriented elements, as was previously done in his Bavarian library, Schrettinger organized books in alphabetical order. The first American school for library science was founded by Melvil Dewey at Columbia University in 1887.\n\nHistorically, library science has also included archival science. This includes how information resources are organized to serve the needs of select user groups, how people interact with classification systems and technology, how information is acquired, evaluated and applied by people in and outside libraries as well as cross-culturally, how people are trained and educated for careers in libraries, the ethics that guide library service and organization, the legal status of libraries and information resources, and the applied science of computer technology used in documentation and records management.\n\nThere is no generally agreed-upon distinction between the terms \"library science\",and \"librarianship\", and to a certain extent they are interchangeable, perhaps differing most significantly in connotation. The term \"library science or library studies\" (LIS) is most often used; most librarians consider it as only a terminological variation, intended to emphasize the scientific and technical foundations of the subject and its relationship with information science. LIS should not be confused with information theory, the mathematical study of the concept of information. \"Library philosophy\" has been contrasted with \"library science\" as the study of the aims and justifications of librarianship as opposed to the development and refinement of techniques.\n\nThe earliest text on library operations, \"Advice on Establishing a Library\" was published in 1627 by French librarian and scholar Gabriel Naudé.\nNaudé wrote prolifically, producing works on many subjects including politics, religion, history, and the supernatural. He put into practice all the ideas put forth in \"Advice\" when given the opportunity to build and maintain the library of Cardinal Jules Mazarin.\n\nMartin Schrettinger wrote the second textbook (the first in Germany) on the subject from 1808 to 1829.\n\nThomas Jefferson, whose library at Monticello consisted of thousands of books, devised a classification system inspired by the Baconian method, which grouped books more or less by subject rather than alphabetically, as it was previously done.\n\nThe Jefferson collection provided the start of what became the Library of Congress.\n\nThe first American school of librarianship opened at Columbia University under the leadership of Melvil Dewey, noted for his 1876 decimal classification, on 5 January 1887 as the School of Library Economy. The term \"library economy\" was common in the U.S. until 1942, with the \"library science\" predominant through much of the 20th century.\n\nLater, the term was used in the title of S. R. Ranganathan's \"The Five Laws of Library Science\", published in 1931, and in the title of Lee Pierce Butler's 1933 book, \"An introduction to library science\" (University of Chicago Press).\n\nS. R. Ranganathan conceived the five laws of library science and the development of the first major analytico-synthetic classification system, the colon classification. In India, he is considered to be the father of library science, documentation, and information science and is widely known throughout the rest of the world for his fundamental thinking in the field.\n\nIn the United States, Lee Pierce Butler's new approach advocated research using quantitative methods and ideas in the social sciences with the aim of using librarianship to address society's information needs. He was one of the first faculty at the University of Chicago Graduate Library School, which changed the structure and focus of education for librarianship in the twentieth century. This research agenda went against the more procedure-based approach of \"library economy,\" which was mostly confined to practical problems in the administration of libraries.\n\nWilliam Stetson Merrill's \"A Code for Classifiers\", released in several editions from 1914 to 1939, is an example of a more pragmatic approach, where arguments stemming from in-depth knowledge about each field of study are employed to recommend a system of classification. While Ranganathan's approach was philosophical it was also tied more to the day-to-day business of running a library. A reworking of Ranganathan's laws was published in 1995 which removes the constant references to books. Michael Gorman's \"Our Enduring Values: Librarianship in the 21st Century\" features his eight principles necessary by library professionals and incorporate knowledge and information in all their forms, allowing for digital information to be considered.\n\nIn more recent years, with the growth of digital technology, the field has been greatly influenced by information science concepts. In the English speaking world the term \"library science\" seems to have been used for the first time in India in the 1916 book \"Punjab Library Primer\", written by Asa Don Dickinson and published by the University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan. This university was the first in Asia to begin teaching \"library science\". The \"Punjab Library Primer\" was the first textbook on library science published in English anywhere in the world. The first textbook in the United States was the \"Manual of Library Economy\", published in 1929. In 1923, C. C. Williamson, who was appointed by the Carnegie Corporation, published an assessment of library science education entitled \"The Williamson Report,\" which designated that universities should provide library science training. This report had a significant impact on library science training and education. Library research and practical work, the area of information science, has remained largely distinct both in training and in research interests.\n\nThe digital age has transformed how information is accessed and retrieved. \"The library is now a part of a complex and dynamic educational, recreational, and informational infrastructure.\" Mobile devices and applications with wireless networking, high-speed computers and networks, and the computing cloud have deeply impacted and developed information science and information services. The evolution of the library sciences maintains its mission of access equity and community space, as well as the new means for information retrieval called information literacy skills. All catalogues, databases, and a growing number of books are all available on the Internet. In addition, the expanding free access to open source journals and sources such as Wikipedia have fundamentally impacted how information is accessed. Information literacy is the ability to \"determine the extent of information needed, access the needed information effectively and efficiently, evaluate information and its sources critically, incorporate selected information into one’s knowledge base, use information effectively to accomplish a specific purpose, and understand the economic, legal, and social issues surrounding the use of information, and access and use information ethically and legally.\"\n\nAcademic courses in library science include collection management, information systems and technology, research methods, information literacy, cataloging and classification, , reference, statistics and management. Library science is constantly evolving, incorporating new topics like database management, information architecture and information management, among others. With the mounting acceptance of Wikipedia as a valued and reliable reference source, many libraries, museums and archives have introduced the role of Wikipedian in residence. As a result, some universities are including coursework relating to Wikipedia and Knowledge Management in their MLIS programs.\n\nMost schools in the US only offer a master's degree in library science or an MLIS and do not offer an undergraduate degree in the subject. About fifty schools have this graduate program, and seven are still being ranked. Many have online programs, which makes attending more convenient if the college is not in a student's immediate vicinity. According to \"US News\" online journal, University of Illinois is at the top of the list of best MLIS programs provided by universities. Second is University of North Carolina and third is University of Washington. All the listings can be found here.\n\nMost professional library jobs require a professional post-baccalaureate degree in library science, or one of its equivalent terms. In the United States and Canada the certification usually comes from a master's degree granted by an ALA-accredited institution, so even non-scholarly librarians have an originally academic background. In the United Kingdom, however, there have been moves to broaden the entry requirements to professional library posts, such that qualifications in, or experience of, a number of other disciplines have become more acceptable. In Australia, a number of institutions offer degrees accepted by the ALIA (Australian Library and Information Association). Global standards of accreditation or certification in librarianship have yet to be developed.\n\nIn academic regalia in the United States, the color for library science is lemon.\n\nThe Master of Library Science (MLIS) is the master's degree that is required for most professional librarian positions in the United States and Canada. The MLIS is a relatively recent degree; an older and still common degree designation for librarians to acquire is the Master of Library Science (MLS), or Master of Science in Library Science (MSLS) degree. According to the American Library Association (ALA), \"The master’s degree in library and information studies is frequently referred to as the MLS; however, ALA-accredited degrees have various names such as Master of Arts, Master of Librarianship, Master of Library and Information Studies, or Master of Science. The degree name is determined by the program. The [ALA] Committee for Accreditation evaluates programs based on their adherence to the Standards for Accreditation of Master's Programs in Library and Information Studies, not based on the name of the degree\n\nAccording to 'U.S. News & World Report', library and information science ranked as one of the \"Best Careers of 2008.\" The median annual salary for 2017 was reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics as $58,520 in the United States. Additional salary breakdowns available by metropolitan area show that the San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara metropolitan area has the highest average salary at $86,380. In December 2016, the BLS projected growth for the field at \"9 percent between 2016 and 2026\", which is \"as fast as the average for all occupations\". The 2010-2011 Occupational Outlook Handbook states, \"Workers in this occupation tend to be older than workers in the rest of the economy. As a result, there may be more workers retiring from this occupation than other occupations. However, relatively large numbers of graduates from MLS programs may cause competition in some areas and for some jobs.\"\n\nLibrarianship manifests a dual career structure for men and women in the United States. While the ratio of female to male librarians remains roughly 4:1, top positions are more often held by men. In large academic libraries, there is less of a discrepancy; however, overall, throughout the profession, men tend to hold higher or leadership positions. Women, however, have made continuous progress toward equality. Women have also been largely left out of standard histories of U.S. librarianship, but Suzanne Hildenbrand's scholarly assessment of the work done by women has expanded the historical record. See also \"The Role of women in librarianship, 1876–1976: the entry, advancement, and struggle for equalization in one profession\", by Kathleen Weibel, Kathleen de la Peña McCook, and Dianne J. Ellsworth (1979), Phoenix, Ariz: Oryx Press.\n\nThere was a \"Women's Meeting\" at the 1882 14th American Libraries Conference, where issues concerning the salaries of women librarians and what female patrons do in reading rooms were discussed.\n\nDuring the first 35 years of the American Library Association its presidency was held by men. In 1911 Theresa Elmendorf became the first woman elected president of the ALA. She was ALA president from May 24, 1911, until July 2, 1912.\n\nIn 1919, an ALA resolution promoting equal pay and opportunities for women in librarianship was defeated by a large margin.\n\nIn 1970, Betty Wilson brought forth a resolution that would have had the ALA refrain from using facilities that discriminate against women. That resolution was also defeated by the membership.\n\nIn 1977, the ALA took a stand for the Equal Rights Amendment. The organization stated that they would no longer hold conferences in states that did not ratify the amendment, with the boycott measure set to take place in 1981. An ERA Task Force was formed in 1979 towards this goal and a sum of $25,000 was allocated towards task force operations in unratified states. At the time, a number of state library associations passed pro-ERA resolutions and formed committees on women in libraries.\n\nIn 2013–2014, 82% of graduates in Master of Library Science (MLS) programs were female.\nIn 2016, Carla Hayden became the first female Librarian of Congress.\n\nThere are multiple groups within the American Library Association, dedicated to discussing, critiquing, and furthering gender-related and feminist issues within the profession.\n\nIn 1969 the first women's rights task force was founded: the National Women's Liberation Front for Librarians (NWFFL or New-Waffle). It was also in 1969 that children's librarians, after being unable to find children's books that included working mothers, worked to remedy the situation and succeeded in their efforts.\n\nThe American Library Association's Social Responsibilities Round Table Feminist Task Force (FTF) was founded in 1970 by women who wished to address sexism in libraries and librarianship. FTF was the first ALA group to focus on women's issues. In recent years during Women's History Month (March), the FTF has dedicated their efforts to expanding women’s library history online, using the website Women of Library History. The FTF also publishes the annual Amelia Bloomer Project list, which includes some of the best feminist young adult literature of the year.\n\nThe Committee on the Status of Women in Librarianship (COSWL) of the American Library Association, founded in 1976, represents the diversity of women's interest within ALA and ensures that the Association considers the rights of the majority (women) in the library field, and promotes and initiates the collection, analysis, dissemination, and coordination of information on the status of women in librarianship. The bibliographic history of women in U.S. librarianship and women librarians developing services for women has been well-documented in the series of publications initially issued by the Social Responsibilities Round Table Task Force on Women and later continued by COSWL.\n\nThe ALA also has the Women & Gender Studies Section (WGSS) of its Division \"Association of College & Research Libraries\"; this section was formed to discuss, promote, and support women's studies collections and services in academic and research libraries.\n\nFinally, the ALA has the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Roundtable (GLBTRT). While the GLBTRT deals with sexuality, different than gender identity, much of the roundtable’s work is arguably feminist in nature, and concerned with issues of gender. The GLBTRT is committed to serving the information needs of the GLBT professional library community, and the GLBT information and access needs of individuals at large.\n\nMany scholars within the profession have taken up gender and its relationship to the discipline of library and information science. Scholars like Hope A. Olson and Sanford Berman have directed efforts at the problematic nature of cataloging and classification standards and schemes that are obscuring or exclusionary to marginalized groups. Others have written about the implications of gendered stereotypes in librarianship, particularly as they relate to library instruction. Library instruction also intersects with feminist pedagogy, and scholars such as Maria Accardi have written about feminist pedagogical practices in libraries. Library scholars have also dealt with issues of gender and leadership, having equitable gender representation in library collection development, and issues of gender and young adult and children’s librarianship.\n\nThe ALA Policy Manual states under \"B.2.1.15 Access to Library Resources and Services Regardless of Sex, Gender Identity, Gender Expression, or Sexual Orientation (Old Number 53.1.15):\" \"The American Library Association stringently and unequivocally maintains that libraries and librarians have an obligation to resist efforts that systematically exclude materials dealing with any subject matter, including sex, gender identity or expression, or sexual orientation. The Association also encourages librarians to proactively support the First Amendment rights of all library users, regardless of sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity or expression. Adopted 1993, amended 2000, 2004, 2008, 2010.\" It also states under \"B.2.12 Threats to Library Materials Related to Sex, Gender Identity, or Sexual Orientation (Old Number 53.12)\", \"The American Library Association supports the inclusion in library collections of materials that reflect the diversity of our society, including those related to sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity or expression. ALA encourages all American Library Association chapters to take active stands against all legislative or other government attempts to proscribe materials related to sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity or expression; and encourages all libraries to acquire and make available materials representative of all the people in our society. Adopted 2005, Amended 2009, 2010.\" \n\nThe field of library science seeks to provide a diverse working environment in libraries across the United States. Ways to change the status quo include diversifying the job field with regards to age, class, disabilities, ethnicity, gender identity, race, sex, and sexual orientation. The demographics of America are changing; those who were once minorities will become the majority. Library facilities can best represent their communities by hiring diverse staffs. The American Library Association and many libraries around the country realize the issue of diversity in the workplace and are addressing this problem.\n\nThe majority of librarians working in the U.S. are female, between the ages of 55–64, and Caucasian. A 2014 study by the American Library Association of research done from 2009 to 2010 shows that 98,273 of credentialed librarians were female while 20,393 were male. 15,335 of the total 111,666 were 35 and younger and only 6,222 were 65 or older. 104,393 were white; 6,160 African American, 3,260 American Pacific Islander; 185 Native American including Alaskan; 1,008 of two or more races, and 3,661 Latino. (ALA).\n\nTo help change the lack of diversity in library jobs in the U.S., more scholarships and grants are emerging. Most library and information science students do not belong to an underrepresented group and as a reaction to these research statistics, the field is creating ways to encourage more diversity in the classroom.\n\nThe ALA Annual Research Diversity Grant Program is a way to encourage innovation in scholars and professionals to provide insight into how to diversify the field. The ALA Grant is directed toward those who have valuable and original research ideas that can add to the knowledge of diversity in the field of Librarianship. The program awards up to three individuals once a year with a grant of $2,500 each. The applicants have submission guidelines, are given a timeline, and are shown the evaluation process online.\n\nOne way to nurture cultural diversity in the library field is with cultural competencies. Scholars recommend defining skills needed to serve and work with others who belong to different cultures. It is suggested that these definitions be posted in job listings and be referred to when promoting and giving raises. In library and information science graduate programs, it is also suggested by scholars that there is a lack of classes teaching students cultural competences. It is important for more classes to teach about diversity and measure the outcomes.\n\nAnother strategy is to create interest in the field of library and information science from a young age. If minorities do not desire to become librarians, they will not seek to obtain an MLS or MLIS and therefore will not fill high job roles in libraries. A recommended solutions are to create a great experience for all racial group's early on in life. This may inspire more young children to become interested in this field.\n\nALA Office for Diversity\n\nThe Office for Diversity is a sector of the American Library Association whose purpose is to aid libraries in providing a diverse workforce, gathering data, and teaching others about the issue of diversity related to the field of library and information science.\n\nAmerican Indian Library Association\n\nThe American Indian Library Association (AILA) was created in 1979. It publishes a newsletter twice a year and educates individuals and groups about Indian culture.\n\nBlack Caucus of the American Library Association\n\nBCALA promotes not only library services that can be enjoyed by the African American community but also the emergence of African American librarians and library professionals. By joining the association, patrons have access to newsletters, the entirety of their website, and networking boards.\n\nCALA\n\nThe Chinese American Librarians Association (CALA) began March on 31, 1973. It was formerly known as the Mid-West Chinese American Librarians Association. It has members not only in America but in China, Hong Kong, Canada, and more. The organization promotes the Chinese culture through the outlet of libraries and communicates with others in the profession of librarianship.\n\nReforma\n\nReforma is the national library association to promote library and information services to Latino and the Spanish speaking, created in 1971. The association has pushed for Spanish collections in libraries, gives out yearly scholarships, and sends out quarterly newsletters. One of Reforma's main goals is to recruit Latinos into professional positions of the library.\n\nDeaf people have the same needs as any other library visitors, and often have more difficulty accessing materials and services. Over the last few decades, libraries in the United States have begun to implement services and collections for D/deaf and HoH patrons and are working to make more of their collections, services, their communities, and even the world more accessible to this group of underserved people.\n\nThe history of the role of libraries in the Deaf community in the United States is a sordid one. The American Library Association readily admits that disabled people belong to a minority that is often overlooked and underrepresented by people in the library, and the Deaf community belongs in this minority group. However, in the last few decades, libraries across the United States have made great strides in the mission of making libraries more accessible to disabled people in general and to the Deaf community specifically. The Library Bill of Rights preamble states that \"all libraries are forums for information and ideas\" and as such libraries need to remove the physical and technological barriers which in turn would allow persons with disabilities full access to the resources available.\n\nOne notable American activist in the library community working toward accessibility for the deaf was Alice Lougee Hagemeyer.\n\nAustralian librarian Karen McQuigg stated in 2003 that \"even ten years ago, when I was involved in a project looking at what public libraries could offer the deaf, it seemed as if the gap between the requirements of this group and what public libraries could offer was too great for public libraries to be able to serve them effectively.\" Clearly, not even so long ago, there was quite a dearth of information for or about the deaf community available in libraries across the nation and around the globe.\n\nNew guidelines from library organizations such as International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) and the ALA were written in order to help libraries make their information more accessible to people with disabilities, and in some cases, specifically the deaf community. IFLA's \"Guidelines for Library Services to Deaf People\" is one such set of guidelines, was published to inform libraries of the services that should be provided for deaf patrons. Most of the guidelines pertain to ensuring that deaf patrons have equal access to all available library services. Other guidelines include training library staff to provide services for the deaf community, availability of text telephones or TTYs not only to assist patrons with reference questions but also for making outside calls, using the most recent technology in order to communicate more effectively with deaf patrons, including closed captioning services for any television services, and developing a collection that would interest the members of the deaf community.\n\nOver the years, library services have begun to evolve in order to accommodate the needs and desires of local deaf communities. There is now a Library Service to People Who Are Deaf or Hard of Hearing Forum for libraries to look at to find out what they can do to better serve their Deaf/HoH users. At the Queen Borough Public Library (QBPL) in New York, the staff implemented new and innovative ideas in order to involve the community and library staff with the deaf people in their community. The QBPL hired a deaf librarian, Lori Stambler, to train the library staff about deaf culture, to teach sign language classes for family members and people who are involved with deaf people, and to teach literacy classes for deaf patrons. In working with the library, Stambler was able to help the community reach out to its deaf neighbors, and helped other deaf people become more active in their outside community.\n\nThe library at Gallaudet University, the only deaf liberal arts university in the United States, was founded in 1876. The library's collection has grown from a small number of reference books to the world's largest collection of deaf-related materials, with over 234,000 books and thousands of other materials in different formats. The collection is so large that the library had to create a hybrid classification system based on the Dewey Decimal Classification System in order to make cataloging and location within the library easier for both library staff and users. The library also houses the university's archives, which holds some of the oldest deaf-related books and documents in the world.\n\nIn Nashville, Tennessee, Sandy Cohen manages the Library Services for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (LSDHH). The program was created in 1979 in response to information accessibility issues for the deaf in the Nashville area. Originally, the only service provided was the news via a teletypewriter or TTY, but today, the program has expanded to serving the entire state of Tennessee by providing all different types of information and material on deafness, deaf culture, and information for family members of deaf people, as well as a historical and reference collection.\n\nMany practicing librarians do not contribute to LIS scholarship, but focus on daily operations within their own libraries or library systems. Other practicing librarians, particularly in academic libraries, do perform original scholarly LIS research and contribute to the academic end of the field.\n\nWhether or not individual professional librarians contribute to scholarly research and publication, many are involved with and contribute to the advancement of the profession and of library science through local, state, regional, national and international library or information organizations.\n\nLibrary science is very closely related to issues of knowledge organization; however, the latter is a broader term which covers how knowledge is represented and stored (computer science/linguistics), how it might be automatically processed (artificial intelligence), and how it is organized outside the library in global systems such as the internet. In addition, library science typically refers to a specific community engaged in managing holdings as they are found in university and government libraries, while knowledge organization in general refers to this and also to other communities (such as publishers) and other systems (such as the Internet). The library system is thus one socio-technical structure for knowledge organization.\n\nThe terms information organization and knowledge organization are often used synonymously. The fundamentals of their study (particularly theory relating to indexing and classification) and many of the main tools used by the disciplines in modern times to provide access to digital resources (abstracting, metadata, resource description, systematic and alphabetic subject description, and terminology) originated in the 19th century and were developed, in part, to assist in making humanity's intellectual output accessible by recording, identifying, and providing bibliographic control of printed knowledge. \n\nInformation has been published which analyses the relations between philosophy of information (PI), library and information science (LIS), and social epistemology (SE).\n\nThe study of librarianship for public libraries covers issues such as cataloging; collection development for a diverse community; information literacy; readers' advisory; community standards; public services-focused librarianship; serving a diverse community of adults, children, and teens; intellectual freedom; censorship; and legal and budgeting issues. The public library as a commons or public sphere based on the work of Jürgen Habermas has become a central metaphor in the 21st century.\n\nMost people are familiar with municipal public libraries, but there are many different types of public libraries that exist. There are four different types of public libraries: association libraries, municipal public libraries, school district libraries and special district public libraries. It is very important to be able to distinguish between the four. Each receives its funding through different sources. Each is established by a different set of voters. And, not all are subject to municipal civil service governance. Listed below is a chart from the New York State Library's library development website. This chart lists all of the information about the different public libraries.\n\nThe study of school librarianship covers library services for children in schools through secondary school. In some regions, the local government may have stricter standards for the education and certification of school librarians (who are often considered a special case of teacher), than for other librarians, and the educational program will include those local criteria. School librarianship may also include issues of intellectual freedom, pedagogy, information literacy, and how to build a cooperative curriculum with the teaching staff.\n\nThe study of academic librarianship covers library services for colleges and universities. Issues of special importance to the field may include copyright; technology, digital libraries, and digital repositories; academic freedom; open access to scholarly works; as well as specialized knowledge of subject areas important to the institution and the relevant reference works. Librarians often divide focus individually as liaisons on particular schools within a college or university.\n\nSome academic librarians are considered faculty, and hold similar academic ranks to those of professors, while others are not. In either case, the minimal qualification is a Master of Arts in Library Studies or Masters of Arts in Library Science. Some academic libraries may only require a master's degree in a specific academic field or a related field, such as educational technology.\n\nThe study of archives includes the training of archivists, librarians specially trained to maintain and build archives of records intended for historical preservation. Special issues include physical preservation, conservation and restoration of materials and mass deacidification; specialist catalogs; solo work; access; and appraisal. Many archivists are also trained historians specializing in the period covered by the archive.\n\nThe archival mission includes three major goals: To identify papers and records that have enduring value, to preserve the identified papers, and to make the papers available to others.\n\nThere are significant differences between libraries and archives, including differences in collections, records creation, item acquisition, and preferred behavior in the institution. The major difference in collections is that library collections typically comprise published items (books, magazines, etc.), while archival collections are usually unpublished works (letters, diaries, etc.) In managing their collections, libraries will categorize items individually, but archival items never stand alone. An archival record gains its meaning and importance from its relationship to the entire collection; therefore archival items are usually received by the archive in a group or batch. Library collections are created by many individuals, as each author and illustrator creates their own publication; in contrast, an archive usually collects the records of one person, family, institution, or organization, and so the archival items will have fewer source authors.\n\nAnother difference between a library and an archive, is that library materials are created explicitly by authors or others who are working intentionally. They choose to write and publish a book, for example, and that occurs. Archival materials are not created intentionally. Instead, the items in an archive are what remain after a business, institution, or person conducts their normal business practices.The collection of letters, documents, receipts, ledger books, etc. were created with intention to perform daily tasks, they were not created in order to populate a future archive.\n\nAs for item acquisition, libraries receive items individually, but archival items will usually become part of the archive's collection as a cohesive group.\n\nBehavior in an archive differs from behavior in a library, as well. In most libraries, patrons are allowed and encouraged to browse the stacks, because the books are openly available to the public. Archival items almost never circulate, and someone interested in viewing documents must request them of the archivist and may only view them in a closed reading room. Those who wish to visit an archive will usually begin with an entrance interview. This is an opportunity for the archivist to register the researcher, confirm their identity, and determine their research needs. This is also the opportune time for the archivist to review reading room rules, which vary but typically include policies on privacy, photocopying, the use of finding aids, and restrictions on food, drinks, and other activities or items that could damage the archival materials.\n\nSpecial libraries and special librarians include almost any other form of librarianship, including those who serve in medical libraries (and hospitals or medical schools), corporations, news agencies, government organizations, or other special collections. The issues at these libraries are specific to the industries they inhabit, but may include solo work, corporate financing, specialized collection development, and extensive self-promotion to potential patrons. Special librarians have their own professional organization, the Special Library Association.\n\nNational Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) is considered a special library. Its mission is to support, preserve, make accessible, and collaborate in the scholarly research and educational outreach activities of UCAR/NCAR.\n\nAnother is the Federal Bureau of Investigations Library. According to its website, \"The FBI Library supports the FBI in its statutory mission to uphold the law through investigation of violations of federal criminal law; to protect the United States from foreign intelligence and terrorist activities; and to provide leadership and law enforcement assistance to federal, state, local, and international agencies.\n\nPreservation librarians most often work in academic libraries. Their focus is on the management of preservation activities that seek to maintain access to content within books, manuscripts, archival materials, and other library resources. Examples of activities managed by preservation librarians include binding, conservation, digital and analog reformatting, digital preservation, and environmental monitoring.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "9736296", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9736296", "title": "Linguistic performance", "text": "Linguistic performance\n\nThe term linguistic performance was used by Noam Chomsky in 1960 to describe \"the actual use of language in concrete situations\". It is used to describe both the production, sometimes called \" parole\", as well as the comprehension of language. Performance is defined in opposition to \"competence\"; the latter describes the mental knowledge that a speaker or listener has of language.\n\nPart of the motivation for the distinction between performance and competence comes from speech errors: despite having a perfect understanding of the correct forms, a speaker of a language may unintentionally produce incorrect forms. This is because performance occurs in real situations, and so is subject to many non-linguistic influences. For example, distractions or memory limitations can affect lexical retrieval (Chomsky 1965:3), and give rise to errors in both production and perception or distractions. Such non-linguistic factors are completely independent of the actual knowledge of language, and establish that speakers' knowledge of language (their competence) is distinct from their actual use of language (their performance).\n\nPublished in 1916, Ferdinand de Saussure's \"Course in General Linguistics\" describes language as \"\"a system of signs that express ideas\".\" de Saussure describes two components of language: \"langue\" and \"parole\". \"Langue\" consists of the structural relations that define a language, which includes grammar, syntax and phonology. \"Parole\" is the physical manifestation of signs; in particular the concrete manifestation of \"langue\" as speech or writing. While \"langue\" can be viewed strictly as a system of rules, it is not an absolute system such that \"parole\" must utterly conform to \"langue\". Drawing an analogy to chess, de Saussure compares \"langue\" to the rules of chess that define how the game should be played, and \"parole\" to the individual choices of a player given the possible moves allowed within the system of rules.\n\nProposed in the 1950s by Noam Chomsky, generative grammar is an analysis approach to language as a structural framework of the human mind. Through formal analysis of components such as syntax, morphology, semantics and phonology, a generative grammar seeks to model the implicit linguistic knowledge with which speakers determine grammaticality.\n\nIn transformational generative grammar theory, Chomsky distinguishes between two components of language production: competence and performance. Competence describes the mental knowledge of a language, the speaker's intrinsic understanding of sound-meaning relations as established by linguistic rules. Performance – that is the actual observed use of language – involves more factors than phonetic-semantic understanding. Performance requires extra-linguistic knowledge such as an awareness of the speaker, audience and the context, which crucially determines how speech is constructed and analyzed. It is also governed by principles of cognitive structures not considered aspects of language, such as memory, distractions, attention, and speech errors.\n\nIn 1986, Chomsky proposed a distinction similar to the competence/performance distinction, entertaining the notion of an I-Language (internal language) which is the intrinsic linguistic knowledge within a native speaker and E-Language (external language) which is the observable linguistic output of a speaker. It was I-Language that Chomsky argued should be the focus of inquiry, and not E-Language.\n\nE-language has been used to describe the application of artificial systems, such as in calculus, set theory and with natural language viewed as sets, while performance has been used purely to describes applications of natural language. Between I-Language and competence, I-Language refers to our intrinsic faculty for language, competence is used by Chomsky as an informal, general term, or as term with reference to a specific competency such as \"grammatical competence\" or \"pragmatic competence\".\n\nJohn A. Hawkins's Performance-Grammar Correspondence Hypothesis (PGCH) states that the syntactic structures of grammars are conventionalized based on whether and how much the structures are preferred in performance. Performance preference is related to structure complexity and processing, or comprehension, efficiency. Specifically, a complex structure refers to a structure containing more linguistic elements or words at the end of the structure than at the beginning. It is this structural complexity that results in decreased processing efficiency since more structure requires additional processing. This model seeks to explain word order across languages based on avoidance of unnecessary complexity in favour of increased processing efficiency. Speakers make an automatic calculation of the Immediate Constituent(IC)-to-word order ratio and produce the structure with the highest ratio. Structures with a high IC-to-word order are structures that contain the fewest number of words required for the listener to parse the structure into constituents which results in more efficient processing.\n\nIn head-initial structures, which includes example SVO and VSO word order, the speaker's goal is to order the sentence constituents from least to most complex.\n\nSVO word order can be exemplified with English; consider the example sentences in (1). In (1a) three immediate constituents (ICs) are present in the verb phrase, namely VP, PP1 and PP2, and there are four words (\"went, to, London, in\") required to parse the VP into its constituents. Therefore, the IC-to-word ratio is 3/4=75%. In contrast, in (1b) the VP is still composed of three ICs but there are now six words that are required to determine the constituent structure of the VP (\"went, in, the, late, afternoon, to\"). Thus, the ratio for (1b) is 3/6 = 50%. Hawkins proposes that speakers prefer to produce (1a) since it has a higher IC-to-word ratio and this leads to faster and more efficient processing.\n\nHawkins supports the above analysis by providing performance data to demonstrate the preference speakers have for ordering short phrases before long phrases when producing head-initial structures. The table based on English data, below, illustrates that the short prepositional phrase (PP1) is preferentially ordered before the long PP (PP2) and that this preference increases as the size differential between the two PPs increases. For example, 60% of the sentences are ordered short (PP1) to long (PP2) when PP2 was longer than PP1 by 1 word. In contrast, 99% of the sentences are ordered short to long when PP2 is longer than PP1 by 7+ words.\n\nEnglish prepositional phrase orderings by relative weight \n\nHawkins argues that the preference for short followed by long phrases applies to all languages that have head-initial structuring. This includes languages with VSO word order such as from Hungarian. By calculating the IC-to-word ratio for the Hungarian sentences in the same way as was done for the English sentences, 2a. emerges as having a higher ratio than 2b.\n\nThe VP and its constituents in 4. are constructed from their heads on the right. This means that the number of words used to calculate the ratio is counted from the head of the first phrase (PP in 3a. and NP in 3b.) to the verb (as indicated in bold above). The IC-to-word ratio for the VP in 3a. is 3/5=60% while the ratio for the VP in 3b. is 3/4=75%. Therefore, 3b. should be preferred by Japanese speakers since it has a higher IC-to-word ratio which leads to faster parsing of sentences by the listener.\n\nThe performance preference for long to short phrase ordering in SVO languages is supported by performance data. The table below shows that production of long to short phrases is preferred and that this preference increases as the size of the differential between the two phrases increases. For example, ordering of the longer 2ICm (where ICm is either a direct object NP with an accusative case particle or a PP constructed from the right periphery) before the shorter 1ICm is more frequent, and the frequency increases to 91% if the 2ICm is longer than the 1ICm by 9+ words.\n\nJapanese NPo and PPm orderings by relative weight \n\n[[Tom Wasow]] proposes that word order arises as a result of utterance planning benefiting the speaker. He introduces the concepts of early versus late commitment, where commitment is the point in the utterance where it becomes possible to predict subsequent structure. Specifically, early commitment refers to the commitment point present earlier in the utterance and late commitment refers to the commitment point present later in the utterance. He explains that early commitment will favour the listener since early prediction of subsequent structure enables faster processing. Comparatively, late commitment will favour the speaker by postponing decision making, giving the speaker more time to plan the utterance. Wasow illustrates how utterance planning influences syntactic word order by testing early versus late commitment in [[Heavy NP shift|heavy-NP shifted]] (HNPS) sentences. The idea is to examine the patterns of HNPS to determine if the performance data show sentences that are structured to favour the speaker or the listener.\n\nThe following examples illustrate what is meant by early versus late commitment and how heavy-NP shift applies to these sentences. Wasow looked at two types of verbs:\n\nVt ([[transitive verbs]]): require NP objects.\n\nIn 4a. no heavy-NP shift has been applied. The NP is available early but does not provide any additional information about the sentence structure – the \"to\" appearing late in the sentence is an example of late commitment. In contrast, in 4b., where heavy-NP shift has shifted the NP to the right, as soon as \"to\" is uttered the listener knows that the VP must contain the NP and a PP. In other words, when \"to\" is uttered it allows the listener to predict the remaining structure of the sentence early on. Thus for transitive verbs HNPS results in early commitment and favors the listener.\n\nVp ([[prepositional verbs]]): can take an NP object or an immediately following PP with no NP object\n\nNo HNPS has been applied to 5a. In 5b. the listener needs to hear the word \"something\" in order to know that the utterance contains a PP and an NP since the object NP is optional but \"something\" has been shifted to later in the sentence. Thus for prepositional verbs HNPS results in late commitment and favours the speaker.\n\nBased on the above information Wasow predicted that if sentences are constructed from the speaker's perspective then heavy-NP shift would rarely apply to sentences containing a transitive verb but would apply frequently to sentences containing a prepositional verb. The opposite prediction was made if sentences are constructed from the listener's perspective.\n\nTo test his predictions Wasow analyzed performance data (from corpora data) for the rates of occurrence of HNPS for Vt and Vp and found HNPS occurred twice as frequently in Vp than in Vt, therefore supporting the predictions made from the speaker's perspective. In contrast, he did not find evidence in support of the predictions made based on the listener's perspective. In other words, given the data above, when HNPS is applied to sentences containing a transitive verb the result favors the listener. Wasow found that HNPS applied to transitive verb sentences is rare in performance data thus supporting the speaker's perspective. Additionally, when HNPS is applied to prepositional verb structures the result favors the speaker. In his study of the performance data, Wasow found evidence of HNPS frequently applied to prepositional verb structures further supporting the speaker's perspective. Based on these findings Wasow concludes that HNPS is correlated with the speaker's preference for late commitment thereby demonstrating how speaker performance preference can influence word order.\n\nWhile the dominant views of grammar are largely oriented towards competence, many, including Chomsky himself, have argued that a complete model of grammar should be able to account for performance data. But while Chomsky argues that competence should be studied first, thereby allowing further study of performance, some systems, such as constraint grammars are built with performance as a starting point (comprehension, in the case of constraint grammars While traditional models of generative grammar have had a great deal of success in describing the structure of languages, they have been less successful in describing how language is interpreted in real situations. For example, traditional grammar describes a sentence as having an \"underlying structure\" which is different from the \"surface structure\" which speakers actually produce. In a real conversation, however, a listener interprets the meaning of a sentence in real time, as the surface structure goes by. This kind of on-line processing, which accounts for phenomena such as finishing another person's sentence, and starting a sentence without knowing how it is going to finish, is not directly accounted for in traditional generative models of grammar. Several alternative grammar models exist which may be better able to capture this surface-based aspect of linguistic performance, including\nConstraint Grammar, Lexical Functional Grammar, and Head-driven phrase structure grammar.\n\nErrors in linguistic performance not only occur in children newly acquiring their native language, second language learners, those with a disability or an acquired brain injury but among competent speakers as well. Types of performance errors that will be of focus here are those that involve errors in syntax, other types of errors can occur in the phonological, semantic features of words, for further information see speech errors. Phonological and semantic errors can be due to the repetition of words, mispronunciations, limitations in verbal working memory, and length of the utterance. Slips of the tongue are most common in spoken languages and occur when the speaker either: says something they did not mean to; produces the incorrect order of sounds or words; or uses the incorrect word. Other instances of errors in linguistic performance are slips of the hand in signed languages, slips of the ear which are errors in comprehension of utterances and slips of the pen which occur while writing. Errors of linguistic performance are perceived by both the speaker and the listener and can therefore have many interpretations depending on the persons judgement and the context in which the sentence was spoken.\n\nIt is proposed that there is a close relation between the linguistic units of grammar and the psychological units of speech which implies that there is a relation between linguistic rules and the psychological processes that create utterances. Errors in performance can occur at any level of these psychological processes. Lise Menn proposes that there are five levels of processing in speech production, each with its own possible error that could occur. According to the proposed speech processing structure by Menn an error in the syntactic properties of an utterance occurs at the positional level.\n\nAnother proposal for the levels of speech processing is made by Willem J. M. Levelt to be structured as so: \nLevelt (1993) states that we as speakers are unaware of most of these levels of performance such as articulation, which includes the movement and placement of the articulators, the formulation of the utterance which includes the words selected and their pronunciation and the rules which must be followed for the utterance to be grammatical. The levels speakers are consciously aware is the intent of the message which occurs at the level of conceptualization and then again at self-monitoring which is when the speaker would become aware of any errors that may have occurred and correct themselves.\n\nOne type of slip of the tongue which cause an error in the syntax of the utterance are called transformational errors. Transformational errors are a mental operation proposed by Chomsky in his Transformational Hypothesis and it has three parts which errors in performance can occur. These transformations are applied at the level of the underlying structures and predict the ways in which an error can occur. \n\nStructural Analysis\nerrors can occur due to the application of (a) the rule misanalyzing the tense marker causing the rule to apply incorrectly, (b) the rule not being applied when it should or (c) a rule being applied when it should not.\n\nThis example from Fromkin (1980) demonstrates a rule misanalyzing the tense marker and for subject-auxiliary inversion to be incorrectly applied. The subject-auxiliary inversion is misanalyzed as to which structure it applies, applying without the verb \"be\" in the tense as it moves to the C position. This causes \"do-support\" to occur and the verb to lack tense causing the syntactic error.\n\nThe following example from Fromkin (1980) demonstrates how a rule is being applied when it should not. The subject-auxiliary inversion rule is omitted in the error utterance, causing affix-hopping to occur and putting the tense onto the verb \"say\" creating the syntactic error. In the target the subject-auxiliary rule and then do-support applies creating the grammatically correct structure.\n\nThis example from Fromkin (1980) shows how a rule is being applied when it should not. The subject-auxiliary inversion and do-support has applied to an idiomatic expression causing the insertion of \"do\" when it should not be applied in the ungrammatical utterance.\n\nStructural Change\nErrors can occur in the carrying out of rules, even though the analysis of the phrase marker is done correctly. This can occur when the analysis requires multiple rules to occur.\n\nThe following example from Fromkin (1980) shows the relative clause rule copies the determiner phrase \"a boy\" within the clause and this causes front attaching to the Wh-marker. Deletion is then skipped, leaving the determiner phrase in the clause in the error utterance causing it to be ungrammatical. \n\nConditions errors restrict when the rule can and cannot be applied.\n\nThis last example from Fromkin (1980) shows that a rule was applied under a certain condition in which it is restricted. The subject-auxiliary inversion rule cannot apply to embedded clauses. In the case of this example it has causing for the syntactic error. \n\nA study of deaf Italians found that the second person singular of indicatives would extend to corresponding forms in imperatives and negative imperatives. \n\nThe following is an example taken from Dutch data in which there is verb omission in the embedded clause of the utterance (which is not allowed in Dutch), resulting in a performance error.\n\nA study done with Zulu speaking children with a language delay displayed errors in linguistic performance of lacking proper passive verb morphology.\n\nThe linguistic components of American Sign Language (ASL) can be broken down into four parts; the hand configuration, place of articulation, movement and other minor parameters. Hand configuration is determined by the shape of the hand, fingers and thumbs and is specific to the sign that is being used. It allows the signer to articulate what they are wanting to communicate by extending, flexing, bending or spreading the digits; the position of the thumb to the fingers; or the curvature of the hand. However, there are not an infinite amount of possible hand configurations, there are 19 classes of hand configuration primes as listed by the \"Dictionary of American Sign Language\". Place of articulation is the particular location that the sign is being performed known as the \"signing place\". The \"signing place\" can be the whole face or a particular part of it, the eyes, nose, cheek, ear, neck, trunk, any part of the arm, or the neutral area in front of the signers head and body. Movement is the most complex as it can be difficult to analyze. Movement is restricted to directional, rotations of the wrist, local movements of the hand and interactions of the hands. These movements can occur singularly, in sequence, or simultaneously. Minor parameters in ASL include contacting region, orientation and hand arrangement. They are subclasses of hand configuration.\nPerformance errors resulting in ungrammatical signs can result due to processes that change the hand configuration, place, movement or other parameter of the sign. These processes can be anticipation, preservation, or metathesis. Anticipation is caused when some characteristic of the next sign is incorporated into the sign that is presently being performed. Preservation is the opposite of anticipation where some characteristic of the preceding sign is carried over into the performance of the next sign. Metathesis occurs when two characteristics of adjacent signs are combined into one in the performance of both signs. Each of these errors will result in an incorrect sign being performed. This could result in either a different sign being performed instead of the intended one, or nonexistent signs which forms are possible and those which forms are not possible due to the structural rules. These are the main types of performance errors in sign language however on the rare occasion there is also the possibility of errors in the order of the signs performed resulting in a different meaning than what the signer intended.\n\nUnacceptable Sentences\nare ones which, although are grammatical, are not considered proper utterances. They are considered unacceptable due to the lack of our cognitive systems to process them. Speakers and listeners can be aided in the performance and processing of these sentences by eliminating time and memory constraints, increasing motivation to process these utterances and using pen and paper. In English there are three types of sentences that are grammatical but are considered unacceptable by speakers and listeners.\nWhen a speaker makes an utterance they must translate their ideas into words, then syntactically proper phrases with proper pronunciation. The speaker must have prior world knowledge and an understanding of the grammatical rules that their language enforces. When learning a second language or with children acquiring their first language, speakers usually have this knowledge before they are able to produce them. Their speech is usually slow and deliberate, using phrases they have already mastered, and with practice their skills increase. Errors of linguistic performance are judged by the listener giving many interpretations if an utterance is well-formed or ungrammatical depending on the individual. As well the context in which an utterance is used can determine if the error would be considered or not. When comparing \"Who must telephone her?\" and \"Who need telephone her?\" the former would be considered the ungrammatical phrase. However, when comparing it to \"Who want telephone her?\" it would be considered the grammatical phrase. The listener may also be the speaker. When repeating sentences with errors if the error is not comprehended then it is performed. As well if the speaker does notice the error in the sentence they are supposed to repeat they are unaware of the difference between their well-formed sentence and the ungrammatical sentence.\nAn unacceptable utterance can also be performed due to a brain injury. Three types of brain injuries that could cause errors in performance were studied by Fromkin are dysarthria, apraxia and literal paraphasia. Dysarthria is a defect in the neuromuscular connection that involves speech movement. The speech organs involved can be paralyzed or weakened, making it difficult or impossible for the speaker to produce a target utterance. Apraxia is when there is damage to the ability to initiate speech sounds with no paralysis or weakening of the articulators. Literal paraphasia causes disorganization of linguistic properties, resulting in errors of word order of phonemes. Having a brain injury and being unable to perform proper linguistic utterances, some individuals are still able to process complex sentences and formulate syntactically well formed sentences in their mind.\nChild productions when they are acquiring language are full of errors of linguistic performance. Children must go from imitating adult speech to create new phrases of their own. They will need to use their cognitive operations of the knowledge of their language they are learning to determine the rules and properties of that language. The following are examples of errors in English speaking children's productions. \n\nIn an elicited production experiment a child, Adam, was prompted to ask questions to an Old Lady\n\nThe most commonly used measure of syntax complexity is the mean length of utterance, also known as MLU. This measure is independent from how often children talk and focuses on the complexity and development of their grammatical systems, including morphological and syntactic development. The number representing a person's MLU corresponds to the complexity of the syntax being used. In general, as the MLU increases, the syntactic complexity also increases. Typically, the average MLU corresponds to a child's age due to their increase in working memory, which allows for sentences to be of greater syntactic complexity. For example, the average MLU of a 7 year old child is 7 words. However, children show more individual variability of syntactic performance with more complex syntax. Complex syntax have a higher number of phrases and clause levels, therefore adding more words to the overall syntactic structure. Seeing as there are more individual differences in MLU and syntactic development as children get older, MLU is particularly used to measure grammatical complexity among school-aged children. Other types of segmentation strategies for discourse are the T-unit and C-unit (communicative unit). If these two measurements are used to account for discourse, the average length of the sentence will be lower than if MLU is used alone. Both the T-units and C-units count each clause as a new unit, hence a lower number of units.\n\nTypical MLU per age group can be found in the following table, according to Roger Brown's five stages of syntactic and morphological development:\nHere are the steps for calculating MLU:\n\n\nHere's an example of how to calculate MLU:\n\nIn total there are 17 morphemes in this data set. In order to find the MLU, we divide the total number of morphemes (17) by the total number of utterances (4). In this particular data set, the mean length of utterance is 17/4 = 4.25.\n\nClause density refers to the degree to which utterances contain dependent clauses. This density is calculated as a ratio of the total number of clauses across sentences, divide by the number of sentences in a discourse sample. For example, if the clause density is 2.0, the ratio would indicate that the sentence being analyzed has 2 clauses on average: one main clause and one subordinate clause.\n\nHere is an example of how clause density is measured, using T-units, adapted from Silliman & Wilkinson 2007:\n\nIndices track structures to show a more comprehensive picture of a person's syntactic complexity. Some examples of indices are Development Sentence Scoring, the Index of Productive Syntax and the Syntactic Complexity Measure.\n\nDevelopmental Sentence Scoring is another method to measure syntactic performance as a clinical tool. In this indice, each consecutive utterance, or sentence, elicited from a child is scored. This is a commonly applied measurement of syntax for first and second language learners, with samples gathered from both elicited and spontaneous oral discourse. Methods for eliciting speech for these samples come in many forms, such having the participant answering questions or re-telling a story. These elicited conversations are commonly tape-recorded for playback during analysis to see how well the person can incorporate syntax among other linguistic cues. For every utterance elicited, the utterance will receive one point if it is a correct form used in adult speech. A score of 1 indicates the least complex syntactic form in the category, whereas a higher score reflects higher level grammaticality. Points are specifically awarded to an utterance based on whether or not it contains any of the eight categories outlined below.\n\nSyntactic categories measured by developmental sentence scoring with examples:\n\nIn particular, those categories that appear the earliest in speech receive a lower score, whereas later-appearing categories receive a higher score. If an entire sentence is correct according to adult-like forms, then the utterance would receive an extra point. The eight categories above are the most commonly used structures in syntactic formation, thus structures such as possessives, articles, plurals, prepositional phrases, adverbs and descriptive adjectives were omitted and not scored. Additionally, the scoring system is arbitrary when applied to certain structures. For example, there is no indication as to why \"if\" would receive four points rather than five. The scores of all the utterances are totalled in the end of the analysis and then averaged to get a final score. This means that the individual's final score reflects their entire syntactic complexity level, rather than syntactic level in a specific category. The main advantage of development sentence scoring is that the final score represents the individual's general syntactic development and allows for easier tracking of changes in language development, making this tool effective for longitudinal studies.\n\nSimilar to Development Sentence Scoring, the Index of Productive Syntax evaluates the grammatical complexity of spontaneous language samples. After age 3, Index of Productive Syntax becomes more widely used than MLU to measure syntactic complexity in children. This is because at around age 3, MLU does not distinguish between children of similar language competency as well as Index of Productive Syntax does. For this reason, MLU is initially used in early childhood development to track syntactic ability, then Index of Productive Syntax is used to maintain validity. Individual utterances in a discourse sample are scored based on the presence of 60 different syntactic forms, placed more generally under four subscales: noun phrase, verb phrase, question/negation and sentence structure forms. After a sample is recorded, a corpus is then formed based on 100 utterance transcriptions with 60 different language structures being measured in each utterance. Not included in the corpus are imitations, self-repetitions and routines, which constitute language that does not represent productive language usage. In each of the four sub-scales previously mentioned, the first two unique occurrences of a form are scored. After this, occurrences of a sub-scale are not scored. However, if a child has mastered a complex syntax structure earlier than expected, they will receive extra points.\n\nThe six main tasks in standardized testing for syntax:\n\nSome of the common standardized tests for measuring syntactic performance are the TOLD-2 Intermediate (Test of Language Development), the TOAL-2 (Test of Adolescent Language) and the CELF-R (Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals, Revised Screening Test).\n\n"}

{"id": "683858", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=683858", "title": "Marae", "text": "Marae\n\nA (in New Zealand Māori, Cook Islands Māori, Tahitian), (in Tongan), (in Marquesan), and (in Samoan) is a communal or sacred place that serves religious and social purposes in Polynesian societies. In all these languages, the term also means \"cleared, free of weeds, trees, etc\". It generally consists of an area of cleared land roughly rectangular (the marae itself), bordered with stones or wooden posts (called ' in Tahitian and Cook Islands Māori) perhaps with terraces (') which were traditionally used for ceremonial purposes; and in some cases, a central stone ' or \"a'u\". In the Rapa Nui culture of Easter Island ' has become a synonym for the whole marae complex).\n\nIn some modern Polynesian societies, notably that of the Māori of New Zealand, the marae is still a vital part of everyday life. However, in tropical Polynesia, most marae were destroyed or abandoned with the arrival of Christianity in the 19th century and some of them have become an attraction for tourists or archaeologists. Nevertheless, the place where the marae were built are still considered as \"\" in most islands.\n\nThe word has been reconstructed by linguists to Eastern Oceanic \"*malaqe\" with the meaning \"open, cleared space used as meeting-place or ceremonial place\".\n In Māori society, the \"marae\" is a place where the culture can be celebrated, where the Māori language can be spoken, where intertribal obligations can be met, where customs can be explored and debated, where family occasions such as birthdays can be held, and where important ceremonies, such as welcoming visitors or farewelling the dead (\"tangihanga\"), can be performed. Like the related institutions of old Polynesia, the \"marae\" is a \"wāhi tapu\", a 'sacred place' which carries great cultural meaning.\n\nIn Māori usage, the \"marae atea\" (often shortened to \"marae\") is the open space in front of the \"wharenui\" or meeting house (literally \"large building\"). However, the term \"marae\" is generally used to refer to the whole complex, including the buildings and the open space. This area is used for \"pōwhiri\" – welcome ceremonies featuring oratory. Some marae do not allow women to perform oratory there. The meeting house is the locale for important meetings, sleepovers, and craft and other cultural activities. The \"wharekai\" (dining hall) is used primarily for communal meals, but other activities may be carried out there. Many of the words associated with marae in tropical Polynesia are retained in the Māori context. For example, the word \"paepae\" refers to the bench where the speakers sit; this means it retains its sacred and ceremonial associations. Marae occur in various sizes, with some wharenui being a bit bigger than a double garage and some being larger than a town hall.\n\nA marae is a meeting place registered as a reserve under the Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 ('The Māori Land Act'). Each marae has a group of trustees who are responsible for the operations of the marae. The Act governs the regulation of marae as reservations and sets out the responsibilities of the trustees in relation to the beneficiaries. Generally each marae has a charter which the trustees have negotiated with the beneficiaries of the marae. The charter details matters such as:\n\nThe New Zealand Māori Arts and Crafts Institute Act, 1963 was passed and the institute built to maintain the tradition of \"Whakairo\". The NZMACI is responsible for the restoration and building of over 40 \"marae\" around New Zealand.\n\nLike in pre-European times, marae continue to be the location of many ceremonial events, including birthdays, weddings, and anniversaries. The most important event located at marae is the tangihanga. Tangihanga are the means by which the dead are farewelled and the surviving family members supported in Māori society. As indicated by Ka'ai and Higgins, \"the importance of the tangihanga and its central place in marae custom is reflected in the fact that it takes precedence over any other gathering on the marae\" (p. 90).\n\nMost iwi, hapū, and even many small settlements have their own marae. An example of such a small settlement with its own marae is at Hongoeka Bay, Plimmerton, the home of renowned writer Patricia Grace. Since the second half of the 20th century, Māori in urban areas have been establishing intertribal \"marae\" such as Maraeroa in eastern Porirua. For many Māori, the \"marae\" is just as important to them as their own homes.\n\nSome New Zealand churches also operate marae of their own, in which all of the functions of a traditional marae are carried out. Churches operating marae include the Anglican, Presbyterian, and Catholic churches. In recent years, it has become common for educational institutions, including primary and secondary schools, technical colleges, and universities, to build marae for the use of the students and for the teaching of Māori culture. These marae may also serve as a venue for the performance of official ceremonies relating to the school. The marae of the University of Auckland, for instance, is used for graduation ceremonies of the Māori Department, as well as welcoming ceremonies for new staff of the University as a whole. Its primary function is to serve as a venue for the teaching of \"whaikōrero\" (oratory), Māori language and culture, and important ceremonies for distinguished guests of the University. Two spectacular secondary school marae are located in the Waikato at Te Awamutu College and Fairfield College. The latter was designed by a Māori architect with a detailed knowledge of carving and weaving. The wharenui features an intricately carved revolving pou as well as many other striking features. In addition to school activities it is used for other weddings.\n\nIn the Cook Islands, there are many historic marae (tapu or sacred places) that were used for religious ceremonies on the islands. Rarotonga and Aitutaki have some particularly impressive marae. Although the carved figures on the marae were destroyed, burned, or taken away by zealous British missionaries, the stones of many of the ancient marae are still there. Some marae are in better shape than others, as vegetation grows fast on the islands. In Rarotonga, a few of the marae (Arai-te-Tonga, Vaerota, Taputapuātea) are still maintained, and are quickly tidied up before the investiture of a new ariki.\n\nRarotongan tradition holds that Taputapuātea marae at Rarotonga, which archaeologists have dated to the 13th century, was built by Tangi'ia who brought the central stone with him from the ancient marae of the same name at Ra'iātea. Indeed, it seems that it was quite usual in ancient times to take a stone from this marae. The son of Tetupaia and Teu had not only the right to a seat in the great Marae of Taputapuatea in Raiatea, but he could take his stone from Taputapuatea and set it up in his own district of Pare Arue (Tahiti), so founding a Marae Taputapuatea of his own to wear the Maro-'ura (red waist girdle of the ariki) in.\n\nMangaia had a marae named Taputapuatea and an 'ariori' house.\n\nIn the remote southeastern corner of the Polynesian Triangle elements of the traditional Polynesian \"marae\" evolved into the Rapa Nui/Easter Island \"Ahu\" and their iconic Moai (giant forms of Polynesian statues).\n\nAccording to Salmond, marae are \"portals between Po, the world of the gods and darkness, and the Ao, the everyday world of people and light, so that people could communicate with their ancestors.\" Notable marae include Vai'otaha marae on Borabora, Mata'ire'a marae on Huahine, and Taputapuatea marae on Ra'itea. 'Oro marae on Tahiti included Vai'otaha marae at Tautira, the first, followed by Utu-'ai-mahurau at Paea, Mahaiatea marae at Papara, Taraho'i marae at Pare-'Arue, and Hitia'a marae on Hitiaa O Te Ra. \n\nIn Tahiti, \"marae\" were dedicated to specific deities, and also connected with specific lineages said to have built them. During the 1994 restoration of Taputapuātea marae at Ra'iātea island by archaeologists from the Tahiti Museum, human bones were discovered under some of the structures. It is possible they were the remains of sacrifices to the Polynesian god Oro, revered in Tahiti.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "613888", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=613888", "title": "Maven", "text": "Maven\n\nA maven (also mavin) is a trusted expert in a particular field, who seeks to pass timely and relevant knowledge on to others in the respective field.\n\nThe word itself is a borrowing from the Yiddish \"meyvn\" 'an expert, connoisseur', derived from the Hebrew \"mēvīn\" 'person with understanding, teacher', a participle of the verb \"hēvīn\" 'to understand', from the West Semitic root \"byn\" 'to be separate, distinguish'.\n\nIt was first recorded (spelled \"mayvin\") in English in 1950 (in the \"Jewish Standard\" of Toronto, Ontario, Canada) and popularized in the United States in the 1960s by a series of commercials created by Martin Solow for Vita Herring, featuring \"The Beloved Herring Maven.\" The “Beloved Herring Maven“ ran in radio ads from 1964 to 1968), and was brought back in 1983 with Allan Swift, the original voice of the Maven.\n\nMany sites credit Vita with popularizing the word. An example of a print advertisement including the Maven is: \"Get Vita at your favorite supermarket, grocery or delicatessen. Tell them the beloved \"Maven\" sent you. It won’t save you any money: but you’ll get the best herring\".\n\nThe word is mainly confined to American English, but did not appear with the publication of the 1976 edition of \"Webster's Third New International Dictionary\". Since the 1980s, it became somewhat more common after William Safire adopted it as a self-promotional tool in the USA, describing himself as \"the language maven\" (among other nicknames). It was included in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" second edition (1989) and the \"American Heritage Dictionary\" fourth edition (2000). Numerous individuals and entities now affix maven or mavin to market their expertise in a particular area. For instance, Joyce Eisenberg and Ellen Scolnic, authors of the \"Dictionary of Jewish Words\" (Jewish Publication Society 2006) call themselves \"The Word Mavens\".\n\nAlthough not always using the name \"maven\", scholars have identified obvious mavens operating in various domains of historical human activity, for example the role of 'Hoppy' Hopkins in sparking the London counterculture of the mid 1960s. More recently the maven has become a topic for academic discussion. For instance, in 1987 Lawrence Feick introduced 'the market maven' concept to the consumer market literature, in his influential essay \"The Market Maven: A Diffuser of Marketplace Information\". Feick differentiated mavens from opinion leaders, general opinion pundits, and early purchasers of novel items. The maven matches his timely information, assiduously gathered according to likely audience needs, with a deep strategic awareness of broader trends.\n\nMalcolm Gladwell popularised the term more widely in his book \"The Tipping Point\" (Little Brown, 2000). Gladwell described those who are intense gatherers of information and also impressions, and so are often the first to become aware of new or nascent trends. The word has since become widely used in marketing contexts and journalistic accounts. Gladwell also suggests that mavens may act most effectively when in loose collaboration with 'social influencers' - i.e., people who have a wide network of casual acquaintances who trust them, often a network that crosses many social boundaries and groups.\n\n"}

Cheney\n\nMay Lucretia Shepard Cheney (May 11, 1862 – April 22, 1942) was born during the Civil War in Garden Grove, Iowa, and was named after the month in which she was born, and her maternal grandmother who influenced her childhood. May's early school attendance was in her hometown. She attended high schools in Oakland and Chico, California before enrolling at UCB in 1879. With her widowed mother, she settled at \"2020 Hearst Avenue\" (then \"College Way\"), in a house with a watermill in the rear yard. Residing in the same house was Lemuel Warren Cheney (1858–1921), a law student.\n\nThe following year, the Shepards moved to 2316 Allston Way, across the street from the campus. Before long, Cheney had moved there too. The Shepards’ last address before May’s graduation in 1883 was Club House No. 4 on the university grounds, again shared by Cheney, now a journalist. In addition to their shared living quarters, May and Lemuel had a common interest in literature. Both belonged to the Neolaean Literary Society, of which May was vice-president.\n\nOn 29 April 1883, during her senior year, she married Cheney, the Bachelor of Letters degree was granted to her in December of that year. They left for Europe, where he served as Balkan Peninsula correspondent for the San Francisco Chronicle. Their first son, Charles Henry Cheney, was born in Rome in February 1884. Upon their return she and her husband had a house built close to UCB, on College Avenue in Lodi.\n\nIn 1886, when she was 24 years old, May founded Cheney’s Pacific Coast Bureau of Education in San Francisco. It was the first commercial teacher placement agency west of the Rockies, and her husband participated in its management. She decided that UCB owed some obligation to the graduates unable to find proper positions. The English universities had appointment secretaries. Harvard University had a similar official. UCB, she thought, should likewise give such a service to students. After she convinced UCB President Martin Kellogg, her plan was accepted. She opened the UCB placement service in the president's office in South Hall on January 1, 1898, and continued to serve as the university’s Appointment Secretary for 40 years, placing countless university graduates as high-school teachers throughout the state.\n\nThe Cheneys raised four sons, three of whom survived to adulthood. The eldest, Charles Henry Cheney (1884–1943), earned the first architectural degree awarded by UC before continuing his studies in Paris, eventually becoming a notable city planner and zoning expert. His son, Warren DeWitt Cheney (1907-1979), was a well-known sculptor and art teacher who took up psychology in midlife, founding the Transactional Analysis Journal. Sheldon Warren Cheney (1886–1980), entered his father’s real estate business before moving to Detroit, where he became a notable author and art critic. In 1916 he founded Theatre Arts Magazine. Marshall Chipman Cheney (1888–1972) became a physician. He did his residency at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston before returning to Berkeley, where he practiced near the campus and at Cowell Memorial Hospital. He lived with his widowed mother at 2241 College Avenue until 1940.\n\nAt the end of 1939, May Cheney sold her two campus houses to the university, and the family soon moved to 116 Tunnel Road. The two Cheney houses on campus were designated City of Berkeley Landmarks in 1990. Built in 1885, 2241 College Avenue is the second oldest surviving structure in the Berkeley Property Tract.\n\nMay L. Cheney was the founder of the National Association of Appointment Secretaries (NAAS) now known as the American College Personnel Association.\n\nIn choosing a permanent home we seek that place above all others which promises abundance of life, stimulus, interests that postpone as long as possible the inevitable apathy of old age. Where do we find this precious boon more abundantly than in Berkeley?\n\nOn August 4, 1919, Cheney was shot at by Roger Sprague, a chemistry assistant who was despondent at not being recommended for further advancement. She escaped unhurt.\n\n"}
{"id": "306913", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=306913", "title": "Modding", "text": "Modding\n\nModding is a slang expression that is derived from the verb \"modify\". Modding refers to the act of modifying hardware, software, or virtually anything else, to perform a function not originally conceived or intended by the designer, or achieve a bespoke specification. The term modding is used within the computer game community, particularly in regard to creating new or altered content and sharing that via the web. It may be applied to the overclocking of computers in order to increase the frequency at which the CPU operates. Case modding is a popular activity amongst many computer enthusiasts which involves the customization of a computer case or the installation of water cooling technology. In connection with automobiles, modding can mean engine tuning, remapping of a vehicle's engine control unit or customization of the bodywork. Some people modify small electronic handheld toys by circuit bending, changing the circuits and adding a knob or switch that will change the produced pitch up or down.\n\nModding may sometimes infringe the legal rights of the copyright owner. Some nations have laws prohibiting modding and accuse modders of attempting to overcome copy protection schemes. In the United States, the DMCA has set up stiff penalties for mods that violate the rights of intellectual property owners. In the European Union, member states have agreed the EU Copyright Directive and are transposing it into national law. A 22-year-old man was convicted by Caerphilly Magistrates' Court in the United Kingdom in July 2005 for selling a modded Xbox with built in software and games. However it is also worthy of note that some other European countries have not interpreted the legal issues in the same way. In Italy a judge threw out a Sony case saying it was up to owners of a console what they did with it. Similarly in Spain, mod chips have been ruled as legal despite the EU copyright legislation. Modding may be an unauthorized change made to a software or hardware to a platform in gaming. Case mods are modifications to a device with the altering of certain styles. For example, people who mod a Microsoft Xbox 360 can alter the LED lights on the controller to glow different colors.\n\nOn August 5, 2009 Matthew Crippen, a 27-year-old student at California State University, Fullerton, was arrested for modifying game consoles including the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Nintendo Wii for profit. Crippen testified that it was so owners could play their backup discs of DRM-laden gaming software that they legally own. However, the DMCA states that it is illegal to circumvent copyright protection software, even for non-infringing uses such as backing up legally owned games. In December 2010 the prosecutors dropped all charges against Crippen because of inadmissible evidence obtained through an audio-less video recording deemed illegal by California law.\n\nComputer systems, hardware, and software are often sold or licensed to one home machine, to a business that has many computers, a government agency, or a non-profit organization. When the software license says that it is for a specific person, then it is not legal for that software to be used by some other person on that same computer, even a member of the same family, or another employee of the same company. But this strict licensing is only one approach. In this form of licensing, for more than one person to be using that software or hardware, they need to have a multi-user license that usually dictates how many different people may use it.\n\nSome software is licensed with a copy of the program source code supplied along with the executable code in which the license specifically authorizes changes to the supplied software. This is a common standard in business software packages. Hundreds of thousands of computer programmers in some nations have jobs because businesses want the purchased software tailored to the specific needs of the individual businesses. Most every major city has want ads in the newspaper where there are job openings for people to modify some company's computer systems, where the ad specifies what programming languages or operating systems the applicant needs to know.\n\nDerivative software is licensed copyrighted software used in whole or part in new programs written by programmers at businesses using the licensed software. Programmers copy the copyright notices into the source code where the code was copied, and track all such places, because if the license is permitted to expire, then the business loses software use rights, including any place to which it was copied. An annual fee is typically paid to keep the license in effect, and over time, the software supplier can increase the fees to the point that the business chooses to convert to some other commercial software that seems to be more cost effective. It is not unusual in business software to find programs that have many different copyright notices, each referring to different sources of the derived source code.\n\nA common example of one kind of modding is video game console mod chips, which can allow users to play homemade games, games legitimately purchased in other regions, or legal backup copies, but can also allow illegal unauthorized copies by allowing the player to play personally recorded CD or DVD copies of video games. Modchips, in their current form, were first available for the Sony PlayStation (and later the PlayStation 2). Various other types of copyright circumvention systems also existed for the Nintendo 64 and the older Game Boy consoles (though neither include actual modding, but instead backup devices).\n\nThere are two different ways of running unsigned code on a game console. One is through soft modding (modifying software, normally using a softmod) to allow the user to change data contained on its hard drive in the case of the Xbox. Another type of modding, known as hard modding, exploits the BIOS of the console to run unsigned code, or games. This form of 'modding' (more correctly termed as hacking) is very popular as it is able to 'run' many different types of software. But soft modding is even more popular because of its ease of installation and its relatively low price (it can even be done for free with the right tools).\n\nAnother type of console modding is about appearances, much like computer case modification. Which includes, adding lights (most likely LEDS, cathodes or other electro-luminescent lighting). Cutting the game system case, to fit hardware and/or expose the internal systems. Cooling is a large part of console hard 'modding', including: heat sink upgrades, more powerful or quieter fans, some even go so far as to abandon common heat exchange to air all together by liquid cooling a console (most notably in the Xbox 360, which initially had some heat problems).\n\nOn the other side, some companies actively encourage modding of their products. In cases such as TiVo and Google, there has been an informal agreement between the modders and the company in which the modders agree not to do anything that destroys the company's business model and the company agrees to support the modding community by providing technical specifications and information. Some commercial video games thrive through a modding community. In the case of \"Half-Life\", a mod called \"Counter-Strike\" drove sales of the original software for years.\n\nModded drivers are made for improved performance which official versions of drivers do not offer or in cases where there are no official versions of drivers for new hardware designed for older operating systems such as Windows 98.\n\n\"Case modding\" may range from simple case painting to full blown case mod with cooling mods and fabricated pieces.\n\nOrtho-modding is the car adaptation (seats, pedals, etc.) to help drivers to prevent, correct and diminish light orthopedic and backbone/spine problems.\n\nEco-modding is the reduction of drag, petroleum car adaptation to use renewable energy (generally, changing or adding a new engine or motor), generally hydrogen or electricity. See hybrid car. Occasionally, it has been known to run a Diesel engine on plant and animal oils. See Biodiesel.\n\nCar and engine tuning are modification of a car for enhanced performance, in engine power output, handling, aerodynamics, or cosmetic purposes. See also .\n\nFactories get rather expensive machines that are used to mass-produce specialized parts. These machines can be altered to make parts other than how the manufacturers of the machines designed or intended them. The legality of doing this depends on who owns the machines, and whether the agreement, that supplied the machines to the factories, said anything about this, and what the laws are in the nation where this is being done.\n\nFor example, the machines might be leased from the manufacturer of the machines. If they are ever to be returned, they need to go back in the same kind of condition and engineering shape as when they were first delivered. There is an annual physical inventory to make sure the factory has everything that they are leasing. This audit might be done by representatives of the leasing company, who are looking to see recognizable machines, that match their models and safety rules.\n\nPen-modding is the act of combining many pen parts either to help with pen spinning, in which a perfect balance is desired to create an ideal spinning pen, or simply for decoration. These pen mods can either be made by combining parts from different pens and/or mechanical pencils, or by buying modded pens online. In some cases, pen mods can exceed over $30–40 USD per pen.\n\n"}

These stones - often basalt rocks or erratic boulders - can be found in the centre of many major cities, as well as in remote villages. Sometimes they are enclosed within an ornamental wrought iron fence, with a gate that can only be unlocked by the local priest or elder. In some places, such as Kathmandu Valley or Pokhara Valley, the Nag Dhunga can be found on the premises of a shrine, or a small pagoda-like temple. These temples are often popular with tourists.\n\nThe Nāga of Hindu mythology are serpent deities, and are the caretakers of lakes and water sources. Lord Shiva has a close association with the Nāga, and is often said to wear them as ornaments. The Nag Dhunga is a rock on which Lord Shiva once rested, identified as such by ancient Vedic priests, at a time when Brahmanism was spreading out from the Indian Subcontinent into the mountain regions of Nepal's Himalayas and to Mount Kailash in Tibet.\n\nPeople are usually very proud to have a Nag Dhunga in their vicinity. They have picnics in front of it during festivals and decorate it with vermilion powder, flowers and small amounts of cash, and often offer milk, beaten rice and fruit to the Nāga that live under or inside the Dhunga. If a large snake is seen around the Dhunga they consider it a manifestation of the Nāga. If people in Nepal frequently encounter a cobra or similar snake at a certain spot, for example at a crossing of paths or beneath a holy Peepal tree, then they worship the spot where they have seen it by offering milk and boiled eggs. They mark the spot with vermilion as a sign for other passers by that they are at a Nāga crossing. Others will follow suit and place small offerings and conduct a \"puja\" (prayer ceremony). Those who are careless and do not notice such a crossing and who urinate or defecate near it will be punished by disease and bad luck. This belief is deeply entrenched in rural populations all over Nepal.\n\nMany Nepalese villages and places have the word Nag, Naga or Dhunga added to their name.

Individual volumes of the series have frequently appeared on lists of the weekly and annual best-seller manga in Japan. It received a Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize and was nominated at the Angoulême International Comics Festival. Its film adaptation has been well received by the Japanese public.\n\n and , the central figures of Christianity and Buddhism respectively, are living together as roommates in an apartment in Tachikawa, part of the suburbs of Tokyo. While taking a vacation on Earth, they attempt to hide their identities and understand modern Japanese society. Each chapter shows their lives during an average day, when they are sightseeing, drinking beer, blogging, or playing video games.\n\nWhile Jesus is portrayed as an impassioned person for his love for all (even for shopping), Buddha tends to be calm and thrifty, and also likes manga. The comedy often involves visual gags and puns, as well as jokes in reference to elements of Christianity and Buddhism; for example, Jesus creates wine from water in a public bath and Buddha shines when excited.\n\nBefore writing \"Saint Young Men\", Hikaru Nakamura was working on \"Arakawa Under the Bridge\", which started to be serialized on December 3, 2004, in the first issue of Square Enix's manga magazine \"Young Gangan\". It attracted the attention of an editor of the magazine \"Weekly Morning\", who wanted Nakamura to publish a series for the magazine. She accepted the offer because of her admiration for Kaiji Kawaguchi's works, such as \"Zipang\" and \"The Silent Service\", that were serialized in \"Weekly Morning\". The series' title is derived from a song by Denki Groove and Scha Dara Parr called . Starting from sketches of two friends wearing casual shirts, she conceived the idea of portraying Jesus and Buddha as average people. \n\nNakamura envisioned a comedy manga in which the protagonist would be a \"very very powerful character\", and realized a divine character would fit this premise. She first planned Jesus to be a character in the series, but to make the gags work well, Buddha was added to the series. Their opposing personalities was inspired by Nakamura's sister and her sister's husband; by observing their relationship, she saw some amusing situations. She also saw a resemblance between her version of Buddha and Osamu Tezuka's version.\n\nDespite the religious references in the series, Nakamura stated she used only her personal knowledge and some aspects of modern society, such as yakuza and blogging, which were not intended to be critical but were added because they fit the story. Similarly, secondary characters were only introduced in the series if a chapter needed a new character to introduce a topic. The themes of the chapters were created before the situations and jokes. However, if Nakamura had a specific theme, she created several jokes and then connected them to form a story. When creating a simpler chapter as compared to the more elaborate, thematic ones, she wrote without worrying about creating jokes and situations in advance. With the help of her four assistants, on average she took between ten days and two weeks to make a complete chapter.\n\n\"Saint Young Men\", written and illustrated by Hikaru Nakamura, began its serialization in Kodansha's seinen manga magazine \"Morning 2\" on September 26, 2006. The series was put on hiatus between September 22, 2011, and March 22, 2012, because of Nakamura's pregnancy. Its first \"tankōbon\" (collected volume) was released by Kodansha on January 23, 2008, and the fifteenth volume was published on June 22, 2018. A guidebook was released on April 23, 2013.\n\nThe series has been translated in other languages, including Chinese by Tong Li Publishing, French by Kurokawa, Italian by J-Pop, and Spanish by Norma Editorial. Ed Chavez, editor of the American publisher Vertical, contacted the Japanese licensor of the series to request its publishing in North America. The Japanese licensor of the series refused to allow it to be published in North America, because it was thought that Americans might take offense to it.\n\nThe production of an anime film was first announced in issue No. 44 of \"Weekly Morning\". Before the film release, a guidebook to the film was published on April 30, 2013. The film was directed by Noriko Takao and written by Rika Nezu. Its characters were designed by Naoyuki Asano and the music was composed by Keiichi Suzuki and Ryomei Shirai. The film was produced by Aniplex, Kodansha and Toho, was animated by A-1 Pictures, and distributed by Toho. It premiered in Japan on May 10, 2013. Its soundtrack was published by Aniplex on May 8, 2013. Later, on October 23, 2013, it was released in DVD and Blu-ray formats. In addition to the film, the same staff produced an original animation DVD (OAD) that was released along with the eight manga volume. A second OAD was released along with the ninth volume.\n\nIn an interview with NHK World, the staff for the anime noted that they wanted to stay loyal to the artwork of the manga while creating the movie. They decided to focus more on the art and character designs, and decided to give it a \"sketched\" look, instead of the traditional \"bold, dark lines\" typically used. All the shadows were colored by pencils, sometimes even scribbled to make sure that the \"sketched\" look came through. Like the manga, the anime film also recreates various attractions of Tachikawa, including the Showa Memorial Park.\n\nA live-action adaptation will premiere on Kakao Japan's streaming service Piccoma TV in the fall of 2018. The director is ; Ken'ichi Matsuyama plays Jesus and Shōta Sometani plays Buddha.\n\n\"Saint Young Men\" received the 2009 Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize for Short Work Manga. The 2009 edition of Takarajimasha's guidebook \"Kono Manga ga Sugoi!\", which surveys people in the manga and publishing industry, named it the best manga series for male readers. It was nominated for the category \"Best Comic\" at the Angoulême International Comics Festival. As the result of its popularity, issues of \"Morning 2\" started selling out on newsstands; because of this, in May 2009 Kodansha began making the magazine available online the day it is published. It has been among the top 20 of best-selling manga series in Japan in 2009, 2011 and 2013. All the first eleven individual volumes appeared on lists of the 50 best-selling manga of their respective year in Japan. By June 2018, the manga had sold about 16 million copies in Japan. The manga was also displayed at the British Museum in 2011. In 2014, \"The Daily Dot\" reported a growing Western fandom that spread various Tumblr GIFs of the series.\n\nComics writer Paul Gravett chose it as one of the best comics of Japan in 2008, while writers Shaenon Garrity and Jason Thompson elected it as one of the most wanted titles for licensing in 2010. Japanese manga critic Kaoru Nagayama has noted that the manga is \"fun to read\" and commended Arakawa for keeping Jesus and Buddha faithful to their real character—of kindness—even when confronted by evil. Carlo Santos from Anime News Network criticized it for its art and questioned its capacity to evolve into something other than \"Jesus and Buddha hanging out, while normal people do embarrassing things to them\". Santos complained that Jesus' and Buddha's philosophical differences and personalities are not explored. However, Santos praised the series' comedy, noting its simplicity and saying, \"its brilliance comes not from purposely trivializing two of the world's great religions, but by highlighting the quirks of the secular world when these famous religious figures are placed in it\". According to him, the series does not lose its capacity of making readers laugh as it progresses, unlike other manga. Jolyon Baraka Thomas of \"The Guardian\" praised the constancy of \"visual gags and puns\", and wrote: \"Her story is not an introduction to abstruse religious doctrines, nor does it feature much overt commentary on the role of religions in contemporary society.\"\n\nThe anime film adaptation of \"Saint Young Men\" debuted at number nine in Japanese theaters, grossing ¥49,930,836 (US$491,369) on 75 screens. In the subsequent weekends it decreased on its placement from nine to eleven, and then to twelve, closing its run with ¥300 million yen ($1,888,062) grossed. Its DVD release ranked seventh on its first week on the list of best-selling anime DVDs in Japan, dropping to twenty-ninth place on its second week on the list.\n\n"}
{"id": "2694761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2694761", "title": "Sensibility", "text": "Sensibility\n\nSensibility refers to an acute perception of or responsiveness toward something, such as the emotions of another. This concept emerged in eighteenth-century Britain, and was closely associated with studies of sense perception as the means through which knowledge is gathered. It also became associated with sentimental moral philosophy.\n\nOne of the first of such texts would be John Locke's \"Essay Concerning Human Understanding\" (1690), where he says, \"I conceive that Ideas in the Understanding, are coeval with Sensation; which is such an Impression or Motion, made in some part of the Body, as makes it be taken notice of in the Understanding.\" George Cheyne and other medical writers wrote of \"The English Malady,\" also called \"hysteria\" in women or \"hypochondria\" in men, a condition with symptoms that closely resemble the modern diagnosis of clinical depression. Cheyne considered this malady to be the result of over-taxed nerves. At the same time, theorists asserted that individuals who had ultra-sensitive nerves would have keener senses, and thus be more aware of beauty and moral truth. Thus, while it was considered a physical and/or emotional fragility, sensibility was also widely perceived as a virtue.\n\nOriginating in philosophical and scientific writings, sensibility became an English-language literary movement, particularly in the then-new genre of the novel. Such works, called sentimental novels, featured individuals who were prone to sensibility, often weeping, fainting, feeling weak, or having fits in reaction to an emotionally moving experience. If one were especially sensible, one might react this way to scenes or objects that appear insignificant to others. This reactivity was considered an indication of a sensible person's ability to perceive something intellectually or emotionally stirring in the world around them. However, the popular sentimental genre soon met with a strong backlash, as anti-sensibility readers and writers contended that such extreme behavior was mere histrionics, and such an emphasis on one's own feelings and reactions a sign of narcissism. Samuel Johnson, in his portrait of Miss Gentle, articulated this criticism:\n\nShe daily exercises her benevolence by pitying every misfortune that happens to every family within her circle of notice; she is in hourly terrors lest one should catch cold in the rain, and another be frighted by the high wind. Her charity she shews by lamenting that so many poor wretches should languish in the streets, and by wondering what the great can think on that they do so little good with such large estates.\nObjections to sensibility emerged on other fronts. For one, some conservative thinkers believed in \"a priori\" concepts, that is, knowledge that exists independent of experience, such as innate knowledge believed to be imparted by God. Theorists of the \"a priori\" distrusted sensibility because of its over-reliance on experience for knowledge. Also, in the last decades of the eighteenth century, anti-sensibility thinkers often associated the emotional volatility of sensibility with the exuberant violence of the French Revolution, and in response to fears of revolution coming to Britain, sensible figures were coded as anti-patriotic or even politically subversive. Maria Edgeworth's \"Leonora,\" for example, depicts the \"sensible\" Olivia as a villainess who contrives her passions or at least bends them to suit her selfish wants; the text also makes a point to say that Olivia has lived in France and thus adopted \"French\" manners. Jane Austen's \"Sense and Sensibility\" provides a more familiar example of this reaction against the excesses of feeling, especially those associated with women readers, and many critics have seen the novel as a critique of the \"cult\" of sentimentalism prevalent in the late eighteenth century.\n\nThe effusive nature of many sentimental heroes, such as Harley in Henry Mackenzie's \"The Man of Feeling,\" was often decried by contemporary critics as celebrating a weak, effeminate character, which ultimately contributed to a discrediting of previously popular sentimental novels (and to a lesser extent, \"all\" novels) as unmanly works. This concern coincided with a marked rise in the production of novels by women writers of the period, whether they chose to write in a sentimental mode or not, and played a significant role in larger debates about gender, genre, literary value, and nationalist political aims during the last decade of the eighteenth century and the first decades of the nineteenth, when the \"National Tale\" emerged in the wake of the French Revolution and England's ongoing conflict—and highly fraught Union—with Ireland.\n\n\n\n"}

They are usually operated on a computer network wirelessly and are distributed over some area to perform tasks, usually sensing through radio-frequency identification. Without an antenna of much greater size the range of tiny smart dust communication devices is measured in a few millimeters and they may be vulnerable to electromagnetic disablement and destruction by microwave exposure.\n\nThe concepts for Smart Dust emerged from a workshop at RAND in 1992 and a series of DARPA ISAT studies in the mid-1990s due to the potential military applications of the technology. The work was strongly influenced by work at UCLA and the University of Michigan during that period, as well as science fiction authors Stanislaw Lem, Neal Stephenson and Vernor Vinge. The first public presentation of the concept by that name was at the American Vacuum Society meeting in Anaheim in 1996.\n\nA Smart Dust research proposal was presented to DARPA written by Kristofer S. J. Pister, Joe Kahn, and Bernhard Boser, all from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1997. The proposal, to build wireless sensor nodes with a volume of one cubic millimeter, was selected for funding in 1998.

{"id": "732780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=732780", "title": "Tony Hawk's Underground", "text": "Tony Hawk's Underground\n\nTony Hawk's Underground is a skateboarding video game published by Activision in 2003, the fifth entry in the \"Tony Hawk's\" series. Neversoft developed the GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox versions, Beenox developed the Microsoft Windows version, which was released in Australia and New Zealand as a budget release in 2005, while the Game Boy Advance adaptation was developed by Vicarious Visions and a mobile version by Jamdat.\n\n\"Underground\" is built upon the skateboarding formula of previous \"Tony Hawk's\" games: the player explores levels and completes goals while performing tricks. The game features a new focus on customization; the player, instead of selecting a professional skater, creates a custom character. \"Underground\" adds the ability for players to dismount their boards and explore on foot. The plot follows the player character and their friend Eric Sparrow as the two become professionals and grow apart.\n\nThe game was developed with a theme of individuality, which was manifested in the extensive customization options, the presence of a narrative, and the product's characterization as an adventure game. Real-world professional skateboarders contributed their experiences to the plot. Upon release, the game was a major critical and commercial success, with reviewers praising its wide appeal, soundtrack, customization, multiplayer, and plot. The graphics and the controls for driving vehicles and walking were less well received. \"Underground\"s PlayStation 2 version had sold 2.11 million copies in the United States by December 2007. A sequel, \"Underground 2\", was released in 2004.\n\nLike its predecessors in the \"Tony Hawk's\" series, \"Underground\" is centered on skateboarding in a series of levels. The player performs tricks via combinations of analog stick and button inputs. For example, the player initiates an ollie (a jump trick) by holding and releasing the jump button. During an ollie, the player may change the position of the analog stick and press one of two buttons to perform either a flip trick (such as an impossible or kickflip) or a grab trick (such as a benihana or nosegrab). The player can grind on certain edges and rails; different tricks may be performed during a grind based on the position of the analog stick. On quarter pipes, the player may execute lip tricks. While skating on flat surfaces, the player may manual in multiple ways via button combinations. Miscellaneous tricks include acid drops and wall-rides.\n\nWhile a grind, lip, or manual trick is underway, a balance meter appears: unless the player prevents this meter from falling to the left or right, the character will bail and need a few seconds to recover. Bailing can also be caused by falling without one's board facing downward. Completing tricks in succession without bailing is called a combo. Comboing raises the player's score and fills up the Special Meter; when it is full, the player is granted access to more elaborate tricks worth more points, such as the McTwist and 540 Flip. \"Underground\" introduces the ability to dismount one's skateboard, which allows the player to explore levels more carefully and reach new areas. Each level features at least one vehicle, usually a car, that the player can drive.\n\nThe levels are based on regions of the United States and other countries. In each level, certain tasks that advance the game's narrative must be completed before the player can move on. These tasks include score attacks, races, item collection, and reaching one of many gaps found in a level. Each level houses one professional skateboarder, who provides a sidequest that unlocks a trick for the Special Meter. On account of the levels' large sizes and the integration of goals into the story, \"Underground\" has been described as an adventure game. Characters can level up their stats—which include jump height and speed—by completing optional goals in a level; this adds an element of role-playing gameplay. Other gameplay modes include multiplayer minigames—one, a combat mode called \"Firefight\", can be played online in the PlayStation 2 version of the game—and a \"free skate\" mode that lets the player explore levels with no goals or story.\n\n\"Underground\" features extensive customization. The player creates a custom character for the story mode, and may not play as a pre-made professional skater outside a few contexts: a special scene late in the game, minigames, and the free skate mode. A level editor allows the player to create skate parks with a large array of objects, ranging from traditional skate park elements like halfpipes, ramps, funboxes, and grind rails to more outlandish pieces like buildings and sections of elevated freeways. The player can change their park's time of day and environmental theme. Tricks, skateboards, and level goals may be customized as well.\n\nWhile the console versions of the game are fully three-dimensional, the Game Boy Advance version is rendered in an isometric style that incorporates both 2D sprites and 3D models. This version is a more traditional \"Tony Hawk's\" game, with little attention given to story or customization. The mobile version is similarly restricted.\n\nThe protagonist and their friend, Eric Sparrow, live in suburban New Jersey and dream of becoming famous skateboarders. The protagonist manages to impress professional skater Chad Muska, visiting town for a demo, who gives them a new skateboard and informs them that a good way to start a skating career is to gain a sponsorship from a local skate shop. The protagonist seeks out Stacy Peralta, who agrees until he sees something to set them apart from the other local skaters, so the protagonist travels to Manhattan with Eric, who is on the run from drug dealers after setting their car on fire for stealing from the skate shop.\n\nThere, the pair shoot a skating video that impresses Stacy, who loans them a van and suggests they enter the Tampa AM, an amateur division skate contest held annually at the Skate Park of Tampa in Tampa, Florida. Upon arrival, Eric is arrested for insulting a police officer, and the protagonist does favors for the local police department to secure his bail. However, when they arrive for the contest, it is revealed that Eric had only completed his own application form and not the protagonist's, forcing a dejected protagonist to try and impress competitors in the pro contest in order to gain admission. After impressing Tony Hawk, the protagonist wins the Best Trick event at Tampa AM and is offered deals by major skateboard sponsors, much to Eric's dismay. The protagonist then heads to San Diego, California to meet Todd, the manager of the team, and completes several photo shoots for a magazine. Following a wild celebration party, it is revealed that Eric has been picked up by the same sponsor.\n\nThe team then flies out to Hawaii to film a video, with the protagonist aiming for local spots that skaters have not filmed at before. Finding a tall hotel, the protagonist climbs to the roof and recruits Eric to film a trick video atop it. The police arrive to arrest them for trespassing, but the protagonist uses the opportunity to perform a McTwist over the helicopter and onto the awning of an adjacent hotel, allowing them and an awestruck Eric to evade the police. The team then travels to Vancouver, British Columbia. After doing errands for locals and finishing their part of the team video, the protagonist attends the video premiere at the Slam City Jam. However, Eric steals the idea and edits the protagonist's part out of the video, allowing only Eric to become a professional. After angrily confronting Eric, the protagonist enters Eric's pro contest and wins, becoming a pro as well.\n\nAfter designing their own pro skateboard, the protagonist and Eric embark on a team trip to Moscow, Russia, where they reconcile. However, Eric gets drunk and joyrides in a Russian military tank. The protagonist hops in and attempts to stop the tank, but being unfamiliar with the controls, fails to stop it from crashing. Eric jumps out and runs away, leaving the protagonist, trapped inside, to be arrested by the Russian military. Eric then lies and claims the protagonist stole the tank, stating that he in fact tried to stop them. Unwilling to pay the $700,000 worth of damages, Todd kicks the protagonist off the team, much to Eric's delight. The American Embassy bails out the protagonist, leaving them to do favors for locals in order to return home to New Jersey.\n\nEric, who now owns his own skate company, reveals that he had been planning to betray the protagonist after having long abandoning the idea of \"soul skating\" (skating for enjoyment rather than riches); after unsuccessfully trying to exempt them from the Tampa AM, Eric stole the helicopter footage in jealousy before finally getting the protagonist kicked off the skate team by lying back in Moscow. Determined to fight back, the protagonist teams up with Peralta and several professionals to create a soul skating video, creating a new trick in the process. Due to the success of the video, Eric challenges the protagonist to one last skate-off, with the unedited helicopter tape at stake. The protagonist wins by avoiding Eric's attempts to cheat and walks away with the tape while Eric breaks down in anger.\n\nIf the story has been completed more than once, an alternate ending occurs, where the protagonist knocks Eric unconscious, taking the tape back instead of holding the skate-off.\n\nThe game features many real world professional skateboarders including: Tony Hawk, Chad Muska, and Stacy Peralta. \"Underground\" also features cameo appearances by Iron Man, a parody of C.H.U.D. called T.H.U.D., and Kiss bassist Gene Simmons.\n\nThe GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox versions of \"Underground\" were developed by Neversoft, while the Game Boy Advance version was developed by Vicarious Visions the mobile version by Jamdat, and the Windows version created by Beenox. Activision, which had acquired Neversoft in 1999, published all versions of the game.\n\n\"Underground\" was created with a theme of individuality: it stars an amateur skater in a true story mode, whereas each previous \"Tony Hawk's\" game had starred professional skaters and had lacked a plot. One reason for only allowing the player to use a custom character was that certain criminal acts completed in the plot would not reflect well on real-world skaters. Previous games in the series had included character-creation features as well, but Neversoft expanded customization in \"Underground\" by implementing face-scanning for the PlayStation 2 version: if the player emailed a photograph of their face to \"faces@thugonline.com\", the company would digitize it for use in the game. Regarding the customization options, especially the park editor, producer Stacey Drellishak stated that Neversoft was \"trying to create the most customizable game ever\". The developers used storytelling and exploration to distance their product from the plotless, task-based format of previous \"Tony Hawk's\" games, which led Neversoft president Joel Jewett to describe \"Underground\" as an adventure game.\n\nLevels in the console versions of \"Underground\" were significantly larger than those of earlier \"Tony Hawk's\" games. Neversoft expanded each level until it ceased to run correctly, then shrunk it slightly. Most of the levels were modelled closely after real-world locations; the designers traveled to locales representative of each city in the game and took photographs and videos as reference. The New Jersey level was a replication of a neighborhood where team artist Henry Ji had grown up as a young skater. Neversoft wanted the player to become familiar with the basic game mechanics quickly and to notice \"Underground\"s differences from previous \"Tony Hawk's\" titles immediately. To accomplish this, they introduced the ability to travel on foot, and the ability to climb along ledges in the first few missions of the game. While Neversoft wanted to keep \"Underground\" realistic and relatable for the most part, they added driving side-missions as an enjoyable diversion and to push the boundaries of freedom in skateboarding games. However, these missions were intended not to take away from the main experience of skateboarding.\n\n\"Pro Skater 4\", \"Underground\"s predecessor in the \"Tony Hawk's\" series, had received criticism for its difficulty: Neversoft had not realized that each game in the series was drawing new fans who were unaccustomed to the demanding tasks. As a result, Neversoft added four difficulty settings to \"Underground\"s story mode, ranging from \"Too Easy\" to \"Sick\". Neversoft wanted players to develop skills for higher difficulty settings on Too Easy while still progressing through the story. The company had included extremely difficult missions in each previous \"Tony Hawk's\" game; the methods used to create these missions were the inspiration for \"Underground\"s Sick mode. Development of the basic gameplay mechanics and structure began quickly but by the end of August 2003, only two months before the game's American release, work was still in progress.\n\nWhile the game's cutscenes are animated with 3D graphics, the team recorded live-action videos to introduce the real-world skateboarding teams, so that players could better understand each team before selecting one to join. Neversoft interviewed professional skaters about their experiences of becoming known in the skateboarding world, then compiled elements of these stories into the game's script. Every skater who appears in the plot helped to craft their own scenes and voiced their own character.\n\nThe game was promoted with a playable demo at Microsoft's \"GameRiot\" event held at Lollapalooza in July 2003. Activision stirred up enthusiasm for \"Underground\" with the \"Tony Hawk's Face Off Mobile Tour\", a series of promotional events across 29 cities in October 2003. Attendees could play the game early and compete in it for tickets to Boom Boom Huck Jam 2003, which Tony Hawk himself attended. Activision, which sponsored the October 2003 Gravity Games extreme sports competition, promoted the game at the event and used its rendering engine to model tricks performed by the real-world skaters. The console and Game Boy Advance versions were released on October 28 in the United States, November 14 in Europe, and May 2004 in Japan. The mobile version was released worldwide in January 2004.\n\nThe game features 77 songs and 1 special song on Bam Margera video, 74 of which are immediately playable in the main game; the other three are unlockable. They range from the late-1970s to the early 2000s by release date and are categorized into three genres: rock, punk, and hip hop.\n\n\"Tony Hawk's Underground\" received \"generally positive\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. GameZone's Michael Knutson stated that \"Underground\" is \"one of the best skating games around\" and that players of every skill level would enjoy it. Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell concurred: \"as a 'pick-up-and-play' sort of game, \"THUG\" is endlessly rewarding once you get your head round the basics, and it's the best entry point for the series to date.\"\n\nThe story was well received. Joe Rybicki of \"Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine\" celebrated that \"for the first time I can remember, an extreme-sports game actually has a real story [with] honest-to-goodness characters\". IGN's Douglas Perry called it \"a kick, albeit relatively lightweight in nature\". He especially praised the pervasive sense of humor in the narrative and in the portrayal of real-world skaters. Knutson called the story \"unique\" and stated, \"I really like that Neversoft had the guts to try something this radical and ditch the formula that they know works so well.\" Ben Silverman of Game Revolution described the game's plot as a \"silly\" cross between those of the 1980s films \"North Shore\" and \"Gleaming the Cube\", but he praised it for giving context to the level goals and keeping distance between the skill unlocks. Bramwell called it \"hackneyed\". Rybicki found that the plot hurt the game's replay value and caused missions to be overly simplistic. By contrast, \"Game Informer\"s Justin Leeper thought that \"it serves to make some of the less-entertaining goals tolerable, because there’s a reason for doing them.\"\n\nThe game's aesthetics were generally well received. Bramwell called the graphics \"unchanged and increasingly antiquated\" and criticized the presence of \"sharp, angular character models, eerily unrealistic lighting and odd little moments when the player is trying to turn round and ends up banging into a curb\". Knutson, meanwhile, was positive regarding the graphics, art, and animation: he called them \"nearly flawless\" and praised the realism they brought to the inherently fantastical skateboarding genre. Williams said that \"\"THUG\"s cityscapes are incredibly well designed\" and singled out the GameCube version of \"Underground\" as exceptionally well rendered. Rybicki called the levels \"big and beautiful\". Knutson commended the soundtrack's large size and the sound effects' realism. Perry appreciated the \"hilariously hurtful\" injury sounds and the extensive song list. By contrast, IGN's Craig Harris praised the graphics of the Game Boy Advance version but was more mixed on the soundtrack.\n\nThe alternate gameplay modes were received very well. Knutson lauded the game's high degree of customization; he summarized that \"everything is expounded a hundred fold: from create-a-skater to create-a-park mode, it is simply amazing\". He singled out the level editor as one of the deepest he had ever seen. GameSpy's Bryn Williams identified the level editor as an \"extremely well-designed\" feature that contributed to the overall \"brilliance\" of the full product. Leeper said that each customization mode is \"intuitive and user-friendly\", and both he and Rybicki especially enjoyed the trick-creation feature. Reviewers for \"Famitsu\" magazine praised the story mode, whose open world format they compared to the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series. Knutson and Perry enjoyed the multiplayer, particularly the online Firefight mode. Williams thought similarly and stated that \"the most notable disappointment\" of the game was the lack of online play for non-PlayStation 2 owners. Harris found the board customization of the Game Boy Advance version to be poorly implemented, though in-depth. Despite his praise for the customization modes, Leeper admitted that his greatest enjoyment still came from \"seeking out great lines and beating my scores\".\n\nThe walking and driving controls were criticized. Bramwell claimed that these modes felt \"like they've been attached with an old stick of glue that's about as adhesive as baby oil\". Knutson agreed, though he praised the novelty of these diversions. He stated that \"the Tony Hawk series has always had exceptional controls\" and that \"Underground\", overall, was no exception. Perry felt that the feature increased levels' replay value. Similarly, \"Famitsu\" reviewers noted that, although the game's fast pace makes it extremely challenging at times, the high difficulty provides a sense of accomplishment when jumps and tricks are performed correctly. Williams found the GameCube version's controls mediocre, albeit manageable. Damon Brown from GameSpot stated that the mobile version's restrictive controls—many tricks require three button inputs—were that version's only caveat.\n\n\"Underground\" won Best Sports Game at the 2003 Game Critics Awards hosted by Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3). The 2004 MTV Video Music Awards introduced a new category, Best Video Game Soundtrack, which \"Underground\" won. In Europe the week after the game's release, the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube versions were respectively the fifth, sixth, and eighth-best selling games for those consoles. It would remain uninterrupted in the top twenty of every week until January 24, 2004, for the Xbox and GameCube and February 21 for the PlayStation 2, inclusive. As of December 2007, the PlayStation 2 edition of the game had sold 2.11 million copies in the United States. The GameCube version made Nintendo's Player's Choice list by selling 250,000 copies in the United States. Its PlayStation 2 version also received a \"Platinum\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom.\n\nNeversoft and Activision released a sequel, \"Underground 2\", on October 4, 2004, for mobile, Microsoft Windows, and the GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox, Game Boy Advance, and PlayStation Portable consoles. The plot continues that of \"Underground\" and focuses on the player character and their team sabotaging an opposing team. The gameplay, structure, and level design are very similar to those of \"Underground\". However, \"Underground 2\" features new tricks and gameplay mechanics, like the Natas spin, the ability to plant customized stickers in levels with the \"sticker slap\", a slow-motion \"Focus\" mode, and the ability to earn points by having a tantrum after falling. The plot is set in new locations, including Boston, New Orleans, Berlin, and Barcelona.\n\n"}

{"id": "182612", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=182612", "title": "World on Fire (book)", "text": "World on Fire (book)\n\nWorld On Fire: How Exporting Free Market Democracy Breeds Ethnic Hatred and Global Instability is a 2003 book by Yale Law School professor Amy Chua. It is an academic study into ethnic and sociological divisions in regard to economic and political systems in various societies. The book discusses the concept of market-dominant minorities, defined as an ethnic minorities who, under given market conditions tend to dominate economically, often significantly, over all other ethnic groups in the country.\n\nThe concept of market-dominant minority was introduced by the author in a 1998 paper \"Markets, Democracy, and Ethnicity\". \n\nIn the Philippines, Chua explains, the Chinese community comprise 1% of the population but control 60% of the private economy, with the result being resentment on the part of the Filipino majority against the Chinese minority creating an ethnic conflict. Similarly, in Indonesia the Chinese Indonesian community make up 3% of the population but control 75% of the economy with similar patterns occurring throughout other Southeast Asian economies.\n\nAccording to Chua, she gives examples of the concept what she calls ethnic \"market-dominant minorities\" such as the Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia; European diasporas throughout Latin America and Africa; Israeli Jews in Israel and the Middle East; Russian Jewish Oligarchs in post-Communist Russia; Croats in the former Yugoslavia; Overseas Indians in East Africa, Overseas Lebanese in West Africa and Mexico, and the Yoruba, Igbos, Kikuyus, Tutsis in Nigeria, Cameroon, and Rwanda.\n\nIn her book, Chua discusses different reasons for the market dominance of different groups. Some groups inherited market dominance because of colonial legacies and apartheid. In other cases, it may be due to the culture and family networks of these groups. For many groups there is no clear single explanation.\n\nAmericans and the United States can also be seen as a global market-dominant minority, in particular when combined with their use of cultural soft power, military strength, economic might, and flaunting political hegemony, thereby causing resentment throughout the world and by the various countries of the international community.\n\nShe believes that democratization can increase ethnic conflicts when an ethnic minority is disproportionately wealthy. \"When free market democracy is pursued in the presence of a market-dominant minority, the almost invariable result is backlash. This backlash typically takes one of three forms. The first is a backlash against markets, targeting the market-dominant minority's wealth. The second is a backlash against democracy by forces favorable to the market-dominant minority. The third is violence, sometimes genocidal, directed against the market-dominant minority itself.\" Also, \"overnight democracy will empower the poor, indigenous majority. What happens is that under those circumstances, democracy doesn't do what we expect it to do – that is, reinforce markets. [Instead,] democracy leads to the emergence of manipulative politicians and demagogues who find that the best way to get votes is by scapegoating the minorities.\" She writes, \"Ballot boxes brought Hitler to power in Germany, Mugabe to power in Zimbabwe, Milosevic to power in Serbia — and could well bring the likes of Osama bin Laden to power in Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nChua states that she is a \"big fan of trying to promote markets and democracy globally,\" but that it should be accompanied by attempts to \"redistribute the wealth, whether it's property title and giving poor people property, land reform ... Redistributive mechanisms are tough to have if you have so much corruption.\"\n\nAmy Chua's other thesis and her conclusions have been disputed by George Leef of the John Locke Foundation, who proposes that many other factors may account for ethnic violence, including the most simple motivation of pure racism. Leef includes in his review: Nothing does more to reduce violence and many other social ills than the rising standards of living that capitalism alone makes possible. What a tragedy it would be if nations were to forego the tremendous long-run benefits of capitalism out of fear that there might be violence in the short-run against those who take advantage of business opportunities the earliest. All that \"World on Fire\" proves in the end is that governments cannot be depended upon to prevent violence against people who have been, for whatever reason, demonized by others. That’s nothing new.\n\nAndreas Wimmer and Brian Min, criticizing the book, state: By contrast, our analysis shows that what has been observed in recent decades may simply be more of the same old story. Although history never repeats itself, the same process patterns may be operating at different times and in different historical contexts (cf. Collier and Mazzuca 2006). The dismemberment of empire and the formation of the nation-state have led to wars since the time of Napoleon. The patterns of warfare in the Caucasus and the Balkans in the 1990s resemble those on the Indian sub-continent in the 1940s, those of Eastern Europe during and after World War I, and so on. The return of the \"Macedonian syndrome,\" as Myron Weiner (1971) has called the intermingling of ethnic conflict and irredentist wars, explains such recurrent patterns of war much better than any variant of globalization theory. To treat them as a fundamentally new phenomenon, brought about by the end of the Cold War or increased globalization, represents yet another example of the widespread tendency among social scientists to perceive their own times as unique and exceptionally dynamic (on \"chrono- centrism,\" see Fowles 1974). They also note that several studies support a variant of the democratic peace theory, which argues that more democracy causes a general decrease in systematic violence, at least for the most democratic nations. However, intermediately democratic nations do have a higher tendency for conflicts such as civil war than autocracies.\n\n\"World on Fire\" was selected as one of \"The Economist\"'s \"Best Books of the Year 2003\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10804916", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10804916", "title": "Zoo Bar (Halifax, West Yorkshire)", "text": "Zoo Bar (Halifax, West Yorkshire)\n\nThe Tramshed and Zoo Bar were two adjoining night clubs in Halifax, West Yorkshire, England. First called \"Theo's Zoo bar\", in the early 1990s, and named after the head bouncer, the original venue was a standalone nightclub. The Tramshed and Zoo Bar were brought to national attention by the media as a \"haven\" for underage drinkers, when they became among the first establishments to be closed under the auspices of the Licensing Act 2003, which came into effect in England and Wales at midnight on 23 November 2005.\n\nOriginally named \"Theo's Zoo bar\" after the head bouncer and before the reputation of an underage venue the Zoo bar was one of the first \"indie\" clubs in halifax. It was classed as an alternative club where people classed the customers as slightly weird. The Djs played classics like \"light my fire\" the Doors_ \"sympathy for the devil\" the stones. Etc. later filling the dancefloor to tunes by the latest indie gods such as Suede, pulp etc. Characters always filled the club. There was \"roller guy\" who wore roller boots and took photos all night, \"daddy Acid\" who used to walk around with a bowl of fruit (apparently laced with Acid tabs). It was a real hive and buzzing place of individual clubbers.\n\nThe tramshed which opened later was home to the upcoming dance scene and often played hours of trance with old black and white movies playing on a huge screen.\n\nDrugs became a huge problem within the clubs and that was the start of the demise. Theo sold up and it was then that the clubs took on a new crowd mainly underage drinkers.\n\nThe Tramshed and Zoo Bars were side-by-side nightclubs in Halifax featuring rock, emo, indie, punk and ska music. They were located on Lord Street close to the former site of Samuel Webster's Fountain Head Brewery. The property the clubs were located in has now been demolished and the land used for social housing.\n\nPolice officers raided the nightclub on 18 November 2005. During the raid, police reportedly identified 420 of the 500 people in the club to be underage drinkers. More than a dozen youths were arrested following scuffles with the police. A 28-day temporary closure order was applied for by the police on 27 November 2005.\n\nThis 2005 incident was cited as the third such raid of the Tramshed and Zoo Bar in which under-age drinking was proven. Previous occasions included December 2003, when almost half of the 150 revellers were found to be under 18. At that time the youngest was 13 and a member of the bar staff was 15. In July 2004, more under-age drinkers were found. Immediately after that incident, attempts to revoke the license under the old licensing laws failed. A local inspector said that, \"We have tried to engage with the licensee on numerous occasions without success... It is the most serious breach of under-age drinking we have come across and there is historical evidence it has happened there before.\"\n\nAfter it was closed, the Halifax Zoo Bar incident became an international lightning rod in Europe, as one paper cited it as a \"notorious kiddie boozer\" where \"legless\" youths could do whatever they wanted. The nightclub was identified in an American study regarding youths and alcohol, as it was the topic of an alcohol advertisement.\n\nTwo years after its closure, consequences of the Licensing Act 2003 are still being felt. Another establishment in Halifax, Fagins Bar, was also closed for underage drinking, after being raided in December 2005, this has since reopened with merit. The Trax night club in Havering was raided at 9 pm on 25 November for drug dealing and its licence revoked. Cardiff City has also implemented its usage to close down clubs.\n\nIn the first year of the Licensing Act 2003 being passed, 100 establishments in England and Wales had their licenses revoked, with some temporarily suspended and others having conditions of use attached.\n\nThe building which housed the Tramshed and Zoo Bar has been sold to developers and is currently undergoing a renovation that will convert the spaces into flats.\n\nThe Zoo Bar (and later the Tram-Shed) nightclubs would host live bands particularly on a Saturday night with varying frequency.\nMany of the artists came from the West Yorkshire area and usually performed the Punk, Ska or Indie genres of music.\nThe bands that performed have gone on to receive varying degrees of national acclaim.\n\nBands which have performed at The Zoo Bar include well known acts such as The Prophecy, Old Man's Child, thesevenmachine, Worm and Lymph.\n\nFor an extended period during 2004–2005, in response to the increased attendances on Friday nights (and as a result the decreased popularity of the club on a Saturday) a stage was set up and bands encouraged to perform on Saturdays. The night was sponsored by local music shop First Floor Music.\n\nThe Tram-Shed part of the nightclub has also previously played host to the heats of 2005 The Pulse of West Yorkshire battle of the bands.\n\n"}
