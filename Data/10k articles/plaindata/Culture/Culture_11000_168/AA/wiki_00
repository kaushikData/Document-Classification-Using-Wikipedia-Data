They are often worn to embellish, enhance, or distinguish the wearer, and to define cultural, social, or religious status within a specific community. When worn to show economic status, the items are often either rare or prohibitively expensive to others. Adornments are usually colourful, and worn to attract attention.\n\nThey have a long history, around the world, from feathers or bone, to modern accessories, such as jewellery. Items of adornment are also used by warriors, and by other members of the military to show rank or achievement.\n\nThese include cosmetics, jewellery, clothing accessories, facial hair, fingernail modification, piercing, lip plates, tattooing, braiding, and head gear.\n\nGroups who practice adornment include the Yakuza, military, religious institutions, tribal groups, and the punk culture.\nItems of adornment can tell us about a person's rank, social status, gender role, area of origin, etc. An example would be the beaded jewelry worn by the Maasai tribe, which is very specific to them and some related tribes.\n\n\n\n"}

However, just as traditional seafaring pirates target sailing ships, air pirates serve a similar role in science fiction and fantasy media: they capture and plunder aircraft and other targets for cargo, loot and occasionally they steal an entire aircraft, sometimes killing the crewmembers in the process. However, their dress and speech may vary; it may correspond to the particular author's vision of the story's setting, rather than their seafaring counterparts. On the other hand, air pirates may be modeled after stereotypical sea pirates. Some air pirates use airborne aircraft carriers as mobile bases from which to conduct raids. Air pirates made early appearances in novels, silent films, comics and pulp magazines, and have since appeared in a variety of media, including alternate history, steampunk, and dieselpunk works.\n\n\nIn real-life use, the phrase \"air piracy\" more often refers to the hijacking and illegal seizure of an aircraft. However, there has been at least one occasion of an act of nautical-type piracy being conducted from the air. This occurred in 1917, when the civilian Norwegian schooner \"Royal\" was boarded and captured by a boarding party from the German Zeppelin L23.\n\n\n"}

The smock is typically a simple, sturdily quilted, collarless, sleeveless gown with adjustable openings at the shoulders and down the front that are closed with nylon hook-and-loop or similar fasteners. The thickness of the garment makes it impossible to roll or fold the garment so it can be used as a noose. It is not a restraint and provides modesty and warmth while not impeding the mobility of the wearer. The suit covers all private areas as the wearer is to be naked under the suit for their own protection. \n\nThese items are formally known as Safety Smocks and were designed and developed by Lonna Speer in 1989 while she was a nurse working in the Santa Cruz, California, county jail. Safety Smocks are now standard issue throughout jails and prisons in the United States. The same material is used for the anti-suicide blanket. Prior to use of the Safety Smock many jails and prisons stripped inmates naked and held them in a stripped down padded cell with no furniture or protrusions of any kind. Some facilities opted to use paper gowns to provide modesty. However, inmates are able to fashion a noose from a paper gown in less than 15 seconds, so most institutions no longer use them. The American Correctional Association (ACA) has established use of appropriate Safety Smocks and Safety Blankets as one of the Standards used to judge jails and prisons for accreditation. Demand for Safety Smocks to meet this ACA Standard led to multiple clothing makers creating similar garments of varying strength and of various materials. In addition to the Safety Smock, Lonna Speer developed the Safety Blanket and the Safe Sleeping Bag, all made from the quilted heavy nylon material, as well as The Dozer, a Suicide Cell mattress, the Safety Pillow, and Safety Slippers.\n\n"}

In some cases, individuals with the condition will exclude whole food groups, such as fruits or vegetables. Sometimes excluded foods can be refused based on color. Some may only like very hot or very cold foods, very crunchy or hard-to-chew foods, or very soft foods, or avoid sauces.\n\nMost people with ARFID will still maintain a healthy or typical body weight. There are no specific outward appearances associated with ARFID. Sufferers can experience physical gastrointestinal reactions to adverse foods such as retching, vomiting or gagging. Some studies have identified symptoms of social avoidance due to their eating habits. Most, however, would change their eating habits if they could.\n\nThe determination of the cause of ARFID has been difficult due to the lack of diagnostic criteria and concrete definition. However, many have proposed other conditions that co-occur with ARFID.\n\nThere are different kinds of 'sub-categories' identified for ARFID:\n\nSymptoms of ARFID are usually found with symptoms of other disorders. Some form of feeding disorder is found in 80% of children that also have a developmental disability. Children often exhibit symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder and autism. Although many people with ARFID have symptoms of these disorders, they usually do not qualify for a full diagnosis. Strict behavior patterns and difficulty adjusting to new things are common symptoms in patients that are on the autistic spectrum. A study done by Schreck at Pennsylvania State University compared the eating habits of children with ASD and typically developing children. After analyzing their eating patterns, they suggested that the children with some degree of ASD have a higher degree of selective eating. These children were found to have similar patterns of selective eating and favored more energy dense foods such as nuts and whole grains. Eating a diet of energy dense foods could put these children at a greater risk for health problems such as obesity and other chronic diseases due to the high fat and low fiber content of energy dense foods. Due to the tie to ASD, children are less likely to outgrow their selective eating behaviors and most likely should meet with a clinician to address their eating issues.\n\nSpecific food avoidances could be caused by food phobias that cause great anxiety when a person is presented with new or feared foods. Most eating disorders are related to a fear of gaining weight. Those who have ARFID do not have this fear, but the psychological symptoms and anxiety created is similar. Some people with ARFID have fears such as emetophobia (fear of vomiting) or a fear of choking, but this is not common.\n\nDiagnosis is often based on a diagnostic checklist to test whether an individual is exhibiting certain behaviors and characteristics. Clinicians will look at the variety of foods an individual consumes, as well as the portion size of accepted foods. They will also question how long the avoidance or refusal of particular foods has lasted, and if there are any associated medical concerns, such as malnutrition. Unlike most eating disorders, there may be a higher rate of ARFID in young boys than there is in young girls.\n\nThe fifth edition of the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" (DSM-5) renamed \"Feeding Disorder of Infancy or Early Childhood\" to Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder, and broadened the diagnostic criteria. Previously defined as a disorder exclusive to children and adolescents, the DSM-5 broadened the disorder to include adults who limit their eating and are affected by related physiological or psychological problems, but who do not fall under the definition of another eating disorder.\n\nThe DSM-5 defines the following diagnostic criteria:\nIn previous years, the DSM was not inclusive in recognizing all of the challenges associated with feeding and eating disorders in 3 main domains:\n\nChildren are often picky eaters, this does not necessarily mean they meet the criteria for an ARFID diagnosis. In addition, self-identification as having ARFID may contribute to the condition.\n\nWith time the symptoms of ARFID can lessen and can eventually disappear without treatment. However, in some cases treatment will be needed as the symptoms persist into adulthood. The most common type of treatment for ARFID is some form of cognitive-behavioral therapy. Working with a clinician can help to change behaviors more quickly than symptoms may typically disappear without treatment. \n\nThere are support groups for adults with ARFID.\n\nChildren can benefit from a four stage in-home treatment program based on the principles of systematic desensitization. The four stages of the treatment are record, reward, relax and review.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9385717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9385717", "title": "B movies (Hollywood Golden Age)", "text": "B movies (Hollywood Golden Age)\n\nThe B movie, whose roots trace to the silent film era, was a significant contributor to Hollywood's Golden Age of the 1930s and 1940s. As the Hollywood studios made the transition to sound film in the late 1920s, many independent exhibitors began adopting a new programming format: the double feature. The popularity of the twin bill required the production of relatively short, inexpensive movies to occupy the bottom half of the program. The double feature was the predominant presentation model at American theaters throughout the Golden Age, and B movies constituted the majority of Hollywood production during the period.\n\nIt is not clear that the term \"B movie\" (or \"B film\" or \"B picture\") was in general use before the 1930s; in terms of studio production, however, a similar concept was already well established. In 1916, Universal became the first Hollywood studio to establish different feature brands based on production cost: the small Jewel line of \"prestige\" productions, midrange Bluebird releases, and the low-budget Red Feather line of five-reelers—a measure of film length indicating a running time between fifty minutes and an hour. The following year, the Butterfly line, a grade between Red Feather and Bluebird, was introduced. During those two years, about half of Universal's output was in the Red Feather and Butterfly categories. According to historian Thomas Schatz, \"These low-grade westerns, melodramas, and action pictures...underwent a disciplined production and marketing process,\" in contrast to the Jewels, which were not as strictly governed by studio policies. While the down-market branding was soon eliminated, Universal continued to focus on low and modestly budgeted productions. In 1919, wealthy Paramount Pictures created its own distinct low-budget brand: the company's Realart films were made attractive to exhibitors with lower rental fees than movies from the studio's primary production line. Indicating the breadth of the budgetary range at a single studio, in 1921, when the average cost of a Hollywood feature was around $60,000, Universal spent approximately $34,000 on \"The Way Back\", a five-reeler, and over $1 million on \"Foolish Wives\", a top-of-the-line Super Jewel. The production of inexpensive films like \"The Way Back\" allowed the studios to derive maximum value from facilities and contracted staff in between a studio's more important productions, while also breaking in new personnel. \n\nBy 1927–28, at the end of the silent era, the production cost of an average feature from Hollywood's major film studios had soared, ranging from $190,000 at Fox to $275,000 at MGM. These averages, again, reflected \"specials\" and \"superspecials\" that might cost as much as $1 million and films made quickly for around $50,000. Some studios, like large Paramount and growing Warner Bros., depended on block booking and blind bidding practices, under which \"independent ('unaffiliated') theater owners were forced to take large numbers of the studio's pictures sight unseen. Those studios could then parcel out second-rate product along with A-class features and star vehicles, which made both production and distribution operations more economical.\" Studios in the minor leagues of the industry, such as Columbia Pictures and Film Booking Offices of America (FBO), focused on low-budget productions; most of their movies, with relatively short running times, targeted theaters that had to economize on rental and operating costs—particularly those in small towns and so-called neighborhood venues, or \"nabes,\" in big cities. Even smaller outfits—the sort typical of Hollywood's so-called Poverty Row—made films whose production costs might run as low as $3,000, seeking a profit through whatever bookings they could pick up in the gaps left by the larger concerns. \n\nWith the widespread arrival of sound film in American theaters in 1929, many independent exhibitors began dropping the then-dominant presentation model, which involved live acts and a broad variety of shorts before a single featured film. A new programming scheme developed that would soon become standard practice: a newsreel, a short and/or a serial, and a cartoon, followed by a double feature. The second feature, which actually screened before the main event, cost the exhibitor less per minute than the equivalent running time in shorts. The majors' comprehensive booking policy, which would become known as the \"run-zone-clearance\" system, inadvertently pushed independent theaters toward adopting the double-feature format. As described by historian Thomas Schatz, the system \"sent a picture, after playing in the lucrative first-run arena, through the 16,000 'subsequent-run' movie houses; 'clearance' refers to the amount of time between runs, and 'zone' refers to the specific areas in which a film played. Typically, a top feature would play in its second run in smaller downtown theaters [many major-affiliated] and then move steadily outward from the urban centers to the suburbs, then to smaller cities and towns, and finally to rural communities, playing in ever smaller (and less profitable) venues and taking upwards of six months to complete its run.\" The \"clearance\" policy prevented independent exhibitors' timely access to top-quality films as a matter of course; the second feature allowed them to promote quantity instead. The bottom-billed movie also gave the program \"balance\"—the practice of pairing different sorts of features suggested to potential customers that they could count on something of interest no matter what specifically was on the bill. As the president of one Poverty Row company would later put it, \"Not everybody likes to eat cake. Some people like bread, and even a certain number of people like stale bread rather than fresh bread.\" The low-budget picture of the 1920s naturally transformed into the second feature, the B movie, of the 1930s and 1940s—the most reliable bread of Hollywood's Golden Age.\n\nThe major companies upon which the Hollywood studio system was built had been resistant to the B-movie trend, but they soon adapted. All ultimately established \"B units\" to provide films for the expanding second-feature market. Block booking increasingly became standard practice: in order to get access to a studio's attractive A pictures, many theaters were obliged to rent the company's entire output for a season. With the B films rented at a flat fee (rather than the box office percentage basis of A films), rates could be set that essentially guaranteed the profitability of every B movie. Blind bidding, which grew in parallel with block booking, meant that the majors didn't have to worry much about the quality of their B's—even when booking in less than seasonal blocks, exhibitors had to buy most pictures sight unseen. The five largest studios—MGM, Paramount, Fox Film Corporation (Twentieth Century Fox as of 1935), Warner Bros., and RKO Radio Pictures (descendant of FBO)—had the additional advantage of being part of companies that also owned sizable theater chains, further securing the bottom line. \n\nPoverty Row studios, from modest outfits like Mascot Pictures, Tiffany Studios, and Sono Art-World Wide Pictures on down to shoestring operations, made exclusively B movies, serials, and other shorts. They also distributed totally independent productions and imported films. These studios were in no position to directly block book; instead, they mostly sold regional distribution exclusivity to \"states rights\" distributors, who would in turn peddle blocks of films to exhibitors, typically six or more movies featuring the same star (a relative status on Poverty Row). Two studios in the middle—the \"major-minors\" Universal and Columbia, moving up in rank—had production lines roughly similar to the top Poverty Row concerns, if somewhat better endowed in general, and with a few up-market productions each year as well. They had few or no theaters, but they did have major-league-level distribution exchanges. \n\nIn the model that would be standard during the Golden Age, the industry's top product, its A films, would premiere at a select number of deluxe first-run metropolitan cinemas, located in U.S. cities with populations in the range of 100,000 and above. There were fewer than 500 of these downtown movie palaces; in 1934, 77 percent of them were under the control of one or the other of the leading studios, the \"Big Five.\" As a whole, the first-run circuit comprised the palaces and another 900 or so houses covering North America's 400 largest municipalities. Double features, though sometimes employed, were the rule at few if any of these prestigious venues. As described by historian Edward Jay Epstein, \"During the[ir] first runs, films got their reviews, garnered publicity, and generated the word of mouth that served as the principal form of advertising.\" After a film's opening run, it was off to the nabes and the hinterland, the subsequent-run market where the double feature prevailed. At the larger local venues controlled by the majors, movies might turn over on a weekly basis. At the thousands of small theaters that belonged to independent chains or were individually owned, programs often changed two or three time a week, sometimes even faster. To keep up with the constant demand for new B product, the low end of Poverty Row turned out a stream of micro-budget movies rarely much more than sixty minutes long; these were known as \"quickies\" for their tight production schedules—a week's shooting was about average, just four days was not unheard of. As historian Brian Taves describes, \"Many of the poorest theaters, such as the 'grind houses' in the larger cities, screened a continuous program emphasizing action with no specific schedule, sometimes offering six quickies for a nickel in an all-night show that changed daily.\" Many small theaters never saw a big-studio A film, getting their movies from the states rights concerns that handled almost exclusively Poverty Row product. Millions of Americans went to their local theaters as a matter of course: for an A picture, along with the trailers, or screen previews, that had presaged its arrival, \"[t]he new film's title on the marquee and the listings for it in the local newspaper constituted all the advertising most movies got.\" Aside from at the theater itself, B films might not be advertised at all.\n\nThe introduction of sound had driven costs higher. In 1930, the beginning of the Golden Age's first full decade, the average U.S. feature film cost $375,000 to produce. A broad range of Hollywood motion pictures occupied the B-movie category: The leading studios made not only clear-cut A and B films, but also movies classifiable as \"programmers\" (also \"in-betweeners\" or \"intermediates\"). These were films that \"straddle[d] the A-B boundary,\" in Taves's description. During the era of the double feature, \"[d]epending on the prestige of the theater and the other material on the double bill, a programmer could show up at the top or bottom of the marquee.\" On Poverty Row, many B's were made on budgets that would have barely covered petty cash on a major's A film, with costs at the bottom of the industry running as low as $5,000. By the middle of the 1930s, the double feature was the dominant exhibition model across the country, and the majors responded. In 1935, B-movie production at Warner Bros. was raised from 12 to 50 percent of the studio's total output. The unit was headed by Bryan Foy, known as the \"Keeper of the B's.\" At Fox, which also shifted half of its production line into B territory, Sol M. Wurtzel was similarly in charge of more than twenty movies a year during the late 1930s. Loew's, the parent company of MGM, announced in 1935 that it would run double features at all of its subsequent-run theaters. A low-cost production unit was established at the studio under Lucien Hubbard, \"although the term \"B movie\" was strictly taboo at Metro.\" Columbia, which primarily served the B-movie market, expanded annual production from thirty pictures to more than forty.\n\nA number of the top Poverty Row firms were consolidating: Sono Art joined with another company to create Monogram Pictures early in the decade. In 1935, Monogram, Mascot, and several smaller studios merged to form Republic Pictures. After little more than a year, the heads of Monogram pulled out and revived their company. Into the 1950s, Republic and Monogram released films that tended to be roughly on par with the low end of the majors' output. Less sturdy Poverty Row concerns—with a penchant for grand sobriquets like Conquest, Empire, Imperial, Supreme Pictures and Peerless—continued to churn out dirt-cheap quickies. As the majors increased their B-level production and Republic and Monogram began to dominate Poverty Row, many of these smaller outfits folded by 1937. Joel Finler has analyzed the average length of feature film releases from the various Hollywood studios in 1938, which indicates the degree to which each emphasized the production of B films (United Artists directly produced no features, focusing instead on the distribution of prestigious films made by independent outfits):\nThe Big Five majors\n\nMGM—87.9 minutes\n\nParamount—76.4 minutes\n\n20th Century-Fox—75.3 minutes\n\nWarner Bros.—75.0 minutes\n\nRKO—74.1 minutes\n\nThe Little Three majors\n\nUnited Artists—87.6 minutes\n\nColumbia—66.4 minutes\n\nUniversal—66.4 minutes\n\nPoverty Row (top three of many)\n\nGrand National—63.6 minutes\n\nRepublic—63.1 minutes\n\nMonogram—60.0 minutes\n\nTaves estimates that half of the films produced by the eight majors in the 1930s were B movies. Calculating in the three hundred or so films made annually by the many Poverty Row firms, approximately 75 percent of Hollywood movies from the decade, more than four thousand pictures, are classifiable as B's. Outside of the highly standardized realm of the series picture, studio executives saw developmental opportunities in their B lines of production. In 1937, RKO production chief Sam Briskin described his company's B films as \"a testing ground for new names, and experiments in story and treatment.\"\n\nThe western was by far the predominant B genre in both the 1930s and, to a somewhat lesser degree, the 1940s; for most of the Golden Age, westerns of every stripe accounted for 25 to 30 percent of all Hollywood feature production. Film historian Jon Tuska has argued that \"the 'B' product of the Thirties—the Universal films with [Tom] Mix, [Ken] Maynard, and [Buck] Jones, the Columbia features with Buck Jones and Tim McCoy, the RKO George O'Brien series, the Republic westerns with John Wayne and the Three Mesquiteers...achieved a uniquely American perfection of the well-made story.\" At the far end of the industry, Poverty Row's Ajax put out films starring Harry Carey, then in his fifties. The Weiss outfit had the Range Rider series, the American Rough Rider series, and the Morton of the Mounted \"northwest action thrillers\" that gave top billing to Dynamite, the Wonder Horse and Captain, the King of Dogs. One notable low-budget western of the era, produced totally outside of the studio system, made money off a curious concept: a western with an all-midget cast, \"The Terror of Tiny Town\" (1938) was such a success in its independent bookings that Columbia picked it up for distribution.\n\nSeries of various genres were particularly popular during the first decade of sound film. At just one major studio, Fox, B series produced by Sol Wurtzel included \"Charlie Chan, Mr. Moto, Sherlock Holmes, Michael Shayne, the Cisco Kid, George O'Brien westerns [before his move to RKO], the Gambini sports films, the Roving Reporters, the Camera Daredevils, the Big Town Girls, the hotel for women, the Jones Family, the Jane Withers children's films, Jeeves, [and] the Ritz Brothers.\" These feature-length series films are not to be confused with the short, cliffhanger-structured serials that sometimes appeared on the same program. As with serials, however, many series were specifically intended to interest young people—some of the theaters that twin-billed part-time might run a \"balanced\" or entirely youth-oriented double feature as a matinee and then a single film for a more mature audience at night. In the words of a contemporary Gallup industry report, afternoon moviegoers, \"composed largely of housewives and children, want quantity for their money while the evening crowds want 'something good and not too much of it.'\"\n\nSeries films are often unquestioningly consigned to the B-movie category, but even here there is ambiguity, as scholar James Naremore describes:\n\nThe most profitable B pictures functioned much like the comic strips in the daily newspapers, showing the continuing adventures of Roy Rogers [Republic], Boston Blackie [Columbia], the Bowery Boys [Warner Bros./Universal], Blondie and Dagwood [Columbia], Charlie Chan [Fox/Monogram], and so on. Even a major studio like MGM [the industry leader from 1931 through 1941] was equipped with a so-called B unit that specialized in these serial productions. At MGM, however, the Andy Hardy, Dr. Kildaire , and Thin Man films were made with major stars and with what some organizations would have considered A budgets.\n\nFor some series, of course, even a major studio's B budget was far out of reach: Poverty Row's Consolidated Pictures, backed by Weiss, featured Tarzan, the Police Dog in a series with the proud name of Melodramatic Dog Features. \n\nA few down-market independent productions were more ambitious: \"White Zombie\" (1932), directed by Victor Halperin and starring Béla Lugosi, is now regarded as the archetypal zombie movie, though it was poorly received at the time. It was picked up by United Artists for distribution after it lost deals with Columbia and the small Educational Pictures. On occasion, a low-end movie would get separated from the pack. Reviewing the 77-minute Universal crime melodrama \"Rio\" (1939), the \"New York Times\" declared that director \"John Brahm's impact on the Class B picture is producing one of the strangest sound effects in recent cinema history. It is that of an unmistakable B buzzing like an A.\"\n\nBy 1940, the average production cost of an American feature was $400,000, a negligible increase over ten years. A number of small Hollywood companies had folded around the turn of the decade, including the ambitious Grand National, but a new firm, Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC), emerged as third in the Poverty Row hierarchy behind Republic and Monogram. The double feature, never universal, was still the prevailing exhibition model: in 1941, 50 percent of theaters were double-billing exclusively, with additional numbers screening under the policy part-time. In the early 1940s, legal pressure forced the studios to replace seasonal block booking with packages generally limited to five pictures (MGM carried on with blocks of twelve for a while). Restrictions were also placed on the majors' ability to enforce blind bidding. These were crucial factors in the progressive shift by most of the Big Five over to A-film production, making the smaller studios even more important as B-movie suppliers. In 1944, for instance, MGM, Paramount, Fox, and Warners released a total of ninety-five features: fourteen had B-level budgets of $200,000 or less; eleven were budgeted between $200,000 and $500,000, a range encompassing programmers as well as straight B movies on the lower end; and seventy were A budgeted at $0.5 million or more. In late 1946, executives at the newly merged Universal-International announced that no U-I feature would run less than seventy minutes; supposedly, all B pictures were to be discontinued, even if they were in the midst of production. The studio did release three more sub-70-minute films: two Cinecolor westerns, \"Michigan Kid\" and \"The Vigilantes Return\", in 1947; the self-explanatory \"Arctic Manhunt\" in 1949. Fox also phased out B production in 1946, releasing low-budget unit chief Bryan Foy, who had come over from Warners five years before. For its B-picture needs, the studio turned to independent producers like the now-freelance Sol Wurtzel.\n\nGenre pictures made at very low cost remained the backbone of Poverty Row, with even Republic's and Monogram's budgets rarely climbing over $200,000. According to Naremore, between 1945 and 1950, \"the average B western from Republic Pictures was made for about $50,000.\" Among the established studios, Monogram was exploring fresh territory with what were being called \"exploitation pictures.\" \"Variety\" defined these as \"films with some timely or currently controversial subject which can be exploited, capitalized on in publicity or advertising.\" Many smaller Poverty Row firms were folding because there simply was not enough money to go around: the eight majors, with their proprietary distribution exchanges, were now \"taking in around 95 percent of all domestic (U.S. and Canada) rental receipts.\" The wartime shortage of film stock was another contributing factor.\n\nReferencing the work of historian Lea Jacobs, Naremore describes how the line between A and B movies was \"ambiguous and never dependent on money alone.\" Films shot on B-level budgets were occasionally marketed as A pictures or emerged as sleeper hits: One of 1943's biggest films was \"Hitler's Children\", an 82-minute-long RKO thriller made for a fraction over $200,000. It earned more than $3 million in rentals, industry language for a distributor's share of gross box office receipts. The violent \"Dillinger\" (1945), made for a reported $35,000, earned Monogram more than $1 million for the first time. A pictures, particularly in the realm of film noir, sometimes echoed visual styles generally associated with cheaper films. Between November 1941 and November 1943, Dore Schary ran what was effectively a \"B-plus\" unit at MGM. Programmers, with their flexible exhibition role, were ambiguous by definition, leading in certain cases to historical confusion. As late as 1948, the double feature remained a popular exhibition mode—it was the standard screening policy at 25 percent of theaters and used part-time at an additional 36 percent. The leading Poverty Row firms began to broaden their scope: In 1947, Monogram established a subsidiary, Allied Artists, as a development and distribution channel for relatively expensive films, mostly from independent producers. Around the same time, Republic launched a similar effort under the \"Premiere\" rubric. In 1947 as well, PRC was subsumed by Eagle-Lion, a British company seeking entry to the American market. Warners' (and Fox's) former Keeper of the B's, Brian Foy, was installed as production chief.\n\nIn the 1940s, RKO—the weakest of the Big Five throughout its history—stood out among the industry's largest companies for its focus on B pictures. From a latter-day perspective, the most famous of the major studios' Golden Age B units is Val Lewton's horror unit at RKO. Lewton produced such moody, mysterious films as \"Cat People\" (1942), \"I Walked with a Zombie\" (1943), and \"The Body Snatcher\" (1945), directed by Jacques Tourneur, Robert Wise, and others who would become renowned only later in their careers or entirely in retrospect. The movie now widely described as the first classic film noir—\"Stranger on the Third Floor\" (1940), a 64-minute B—was produced at RKO, which would release many melodramatic thrillers in a similarly stylish vein during the decade. The other major studios also turned out a considerable number of movies now identified as noir during the 1940s. Though many of the best-known film noirs were well-financed productions—the majority of Warner Bros. noirs, for instance, were produced at the studio's A level—most 1940s pictures in the mode were either of the ambiguous programmer type or destined straight for the bottom of the bill. In the decades since, these cheap entertainments, generally dismissed at the time, have become some of the most treasured products of Hollywood's Golden Age among aficionados. \n\nIn one sample year, 1947, RKO under production chief Dore Schary shot fifteen A-level features at an average cost of $1 million and twenty Bs averaging $215,000. In addition to several noir programmers and full-flight A pictures, the studio put out two straight B noirs: \"Desperate\", directed by Anthony Mann, and \"The Devil Thumbs a Ride\", directed by Felix E. Feist. Ten straight B noirs that year came from Poverty Row's big three: Republic (\"Blackmail\" and \"The Pretender\"), Monogram (\"Fall Guy\", \"The Guilty\", \"High Tide\", and \"Violence\"), and PRC/Eagle-Lion (\"Bury Me Dead\", \"Lighthouse\", \"Whispering City\", and \"Railroaded\", another work of Mann). One came from tiny Screen Guild (\"Shoot to Kill\"). Three majors beside RKO also contributed: Columbia (\"Blind Spot\" and \"Framed\"), Paramount (\"Fear in the Night\"), and 20th Century-Fox (\"Backlash\" and \"The Brasher Doubloon\"). Adding programmers to that list of eighteen would bring it to around thirty. Still, most of the majors' low-budget production during the decade was of the sort now largely ignored. RKO's representative output included the Mexican Spitfire and Lum and Abner comedy series, thrillers featuring the Saint and the Falcon, westerns starring Tim Holt, and Tarzan movies with Johnny Weissmuller. Jean Hersholt played Dr. Christian in six independently produced films released by RKO between 1939 and 1941. \"The Courageous Dr. Christian\" (1940) was a standard entry in the franchise: \"In the course of an hour or so of screen time, the saintly physician managed to cure an epidemic of spinal meningitis, demonstrate benevolence towards the disenfranchised, set an example for wayward youth, and calm the passions of an amorous old maid.\" \n\nDown in Poverty Row, low budgets led to less palliative fare. Republic aspired to major-league respectability while making lots of cheap and modestly budgeted westerns, but there was not much from the bigger studios that compared with Monogram \"exploitation pictures\" like juvenile delinquency exposé \"Where Are Your Children?\" (1943) and the prison film \"Women in Bondage\" (1943). In 1947, PRC's \"The Devil on Wheels\" brought together teenagers, hot rods, and death. The little studio had its own house auteur: with his own crew and relatively free rein, director Edgar G. Ulmer was known as \"the Capra of PRC.\" Described by critic and historian David Thomson as \"one of the most fascinating talents in the worldwide labyrinth of sub-B pictures,\" Ulmer made films of every generic stripe. His \"Girls in Chains\" was released in May 1943, six months before \"Women in Bondage\"; by the end of the year, Ulmer had also made the teen-themed musical \"Jive Junction\" as well as \"Isle of Forgotten Sins\", a South Seas adventure set around a brothel.\n\n"}

{"id": "591492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=591492", "title": "Complementary good", "text": "Complementary good\n\nIn economics, a complementary goods or complement is a goods with a negative cross elasticity of demand, in contrast to a substitute goods. This means a good's demand is increased when the price of another goods is decreased. Conversely, the demand for a goods is decreased when the price of another goods is increased. If goods A and B are complements, an increase in the price of A will result in a leftward movement along the demand curve of A and cause the demand curve for B to shift in; less of each goods will be demanded. \nA decrease in price of A will result in a rightward movement along the demand curve of A and cause the demand curve B to shift outward; more of each goods will be demanded. Basically this means that since the demand of one goods is linked to the demand of another goods, if a higher quantity is demanded of one goods, a higher quantity will also be demanded of the other, and if a lower quantity is demanded of one goods, a lower quantity will be demanded of the other. The prices of complementary goods are related in the same way: if the price of one goods rises, so will the price of the other, and vice versa. With substitute goods, however, the price and quantity demanded of one goods is related inversely to the price and quantity demanded of a substitute goods, meaning that if the price or quantity demanded of one goods rises, the price or quantity demanded of its substitute will fall.\n\nWhen two goods are complements, they experience joint demand. For example, the demand for razor blades may depend upon the number of razors in use; this is why razors have sometimes been sold as loss leaders, to increase demand for the associated blades.\n\nRecent work in food consumption has elucidated the psychological processes by which the consumption of one goods (e.g., cola) stimulates demand for its complements (e.g., a cheeseburger, pizza, etc.). Consumption of a food or beverage activates a goal to consume its complements: foods that consumers believe would produce super-additive utility (i.e., would taste better together). Eating peanut-butter covered crackers, for instance, increases the consumption of grape-jelly covered crackers more than eating plain crackers. Drinking cola increases consumers' willingness to pay for a voucher for a cheeseburger. This effect appears to be contingent on consumers' perceptions of what foods are complements rather than their sensory properties.\n\nAn example of this would be the demand for cars and petrol. The supply and demand of cars is represented by the figure at the right with the initial demand D1. Suppose that the initial price of cars is represented by P1 with a quantity demanded of Q1. If the price of petrol were to decrease by some amount, this would result in a higher quantity of cars demanded. This higher quantity demanded would cause the demand curve to shift rightward to a new position D2. Assuming a constant supply curve S of cars, the new increased quantity demanded will be at D2 with a new increased price P2. Other examples include: Automobile and fuel, mobile phone and cellular service provider, Printer and Cartridge among others.\n\nA perfect complement is a good that \"has\" to be consumed with another good. The indifference curve of a perfect complement will exhibit a right angle, as illustrated by the figure at the right. Such preferences are often represented by a Leontief utility function.\n\nFew goods in the real world will behave as perfect complements. One example is a left shoe and a right; shoes are naturally sold in pairs, and the ratio between sales of left and right shoes will never shift noticeably from 1:1, even if, for example, someone is missing a leg and buys just one shoe.\n\nThe degree of complementarity, however, does not have to be mutual; it can be measured by cross price elasticity of demand. In the case of video games, a specific video game (the complement good) has to be consumed with a video game console (the base good). It does not work the other way: a video game console does not have to be consumed with that game.\n\nA classic example of mutually perfect complements is the case of pencils and erasers. Imagine an accountant who will need to prepare financial statements, but in doing so must use pencils to make all calculations and erasers to correct errors. The accountant knows that for every three pencils, one eraser will be needed. Any more pencils will serve no purpose, because they will not be able to erase the calculations. Any more erasers will not be useful either, because there will not be enough pencils for them to make a large enough mess with in order to require more erasers.\n\nIn this case the utility would be given by an increasing function of:\n\nIn marketing, complementary goods give additional market power to the company. It allows vendor lock-in as it increases the switching cost. A few types of pricing strategy exist for a complementary good and its base good:\n\n"}
{"id": "6139861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6139861", "title": "Cultural depictions of dinosaurs", "text": "Cultural depictions of dinosaurs\n\nCultural depictions of dinosaurs have been numerous since the word \"dinosaur\" was coined in 1842. The dinosaurs featured in books, films, television programs, artwork, and other media have been used for both education and entertainment. The depictions range from the realistic, as in the television documentaries of the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, or the fantastic, as in the monster movies of the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nThe growth in interest in dinosaurs since the Dinosaur Renaissance has been accompanied by depictions made by artists working with ideas at the forefront of dinosaur science, presenting lively dinosaurs and feathered dinosaurs as these concepts were first being considered. Cultural depictions of dinosaurs have been an important means of translating scientific discoveries to the public.\n\nCultural depictions have also created or reinforced misconceptions about dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals, such as inaccurately and anachronistically portraying a sort of \"prehistoric world\" where many kinds of extinct animals (from the Permian animal \"Dimetrodon\" to mammoths and cavemen) lived together, and dinosaurs lived lives of constant combat. Other misconceptions reinforced by cultural depictions came from a scientific consensus that has now been overturned, such as dinosaurs being slow and unintelligent, or the use of \"dinosaur\" to describe something that is maladapted or obsolete. \n\nDepictions are necessarily conjectural, because petrification and other fossilization mechanisms do not preserve all details. Any reconstitution is thereby an artist's view that, in order to stay within the limits of the best knowledge at the time, must necessarily be inspired by other pictures already scientifically proved.\n\nThe classical folklorist Adrienne Mayor has proposed that the griffin of mythology is based on dinosaur skeletons found in the Gobi Desert. She noted that griffins were said to inhabit the Scythian steppes that reached from modern Ukraine to central Asia. Mayor draws a connection to \"Protoceratops\", a frilled dinosaur commonly found in the Gobi, sharing features associated with griffins: sharp beaks, four legs, claws, similar size, and large eyes (or eye sockets in the case of the fossils); and the neck frill of \"Protoceratops\", with large open holes, is consistent with descriptions of the griffin's large ears or wings. However, the palaeontologist Mark Witton notes that the suggestion ignores pre-Mycenaean accounts, and has not found favour with archaeologists including N. Wyatt and T.F. Tartaron.\nThe scientific study of dinosaurs began in 1820s England. In 1842, Richard Owen coined the term \"dinosaur\", which in his vision were elephantine reptiles. An ambitious promoter of his discoveries and theories, Owen was the driving force for the Crystal Palace dinosaur sculptures, the first large-scale public dinosaur reconstructions (1854). These sculptures, which can still be seen today, immortalized a very early stage in the perception of dinosaurs.\n\nThe Crystal Palace sculptures were successful enough that Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins, Owen's collaborator, sold models of his sculptures and planned a second exhibition, Paleozoic Museum, for Central Park in Manhattan in the late 1860s; it was never completed due to the interference of local politics and \"Boss\" William Marcy Tweed.\n\nIn the same period, dinosaurs first appeared in popular literature, with a passing mention of an Owen-style \"Megalosaurus\" in Charles Dickens's \"Bleak House\" (1852–1853). However, depictions of dinosaurs were rare in the 19th century, possibly due to incomplete knowledge. Despite the well-publicized \"Bone Wars\" of the late 19th century between the American palaeontologists Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh, dinosaurs were not yet ingrained in culture. Marsh, although a pioneer of skeletal reconstructions, did not support putting mounted skeletons on display, and derided the Crystal Palace sculptures.\n\nAs study caught up to the wealth of new material from western North America, and venues for depictions proliferated, dinosaurs gained in popularity. The paintings of Charles R. Knight were the first influential representations of these finds. Knight worked extensively with the American Museum of Natural History and its director, Henry Fairfield Osborn, who wanted to use dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals to promote his museum and his ideas on evolution.\n\nKnight's work, found in museums around the United States, helped popularize dinosaurs and influenced generations of paleoartists. His early work showing fighting \"Laelaps\" (=\"Dryptosaurus\") depicted dinosaurs as much more lively than they would be presented for much of the 20th century. At the same time, improvements in casting allowed dinosaur skeletons to be reproduced and shipped across the world for display in far-flung museums, bringing them to the attention of a wider audience; \"Diplodocus\" was the first such dinosaur reproduced in this way.\n\nDinosaurs began appearing in films soon after the introduction of cinema, the first being the good-natured animated \"Gertie the Dinosaur\" in 1914. However, lovable dinosaurs were quickly replaced as moviemakers recognized the thrill of huge frightening monsters. D. W. Griffith in 1914's \"Brute Force\" provided the first example of a threatening cinematic dinosaur, a \"Ceratosaurus\" who menaced cavemen. This film enshrined the fiction that dinosaurs and early humans lived together, and set up the cliché that dinosaurs were bloodthirsty and attacked anything that moved.\n\nThe now-common trope of dinosaurs extant in isolated locations in today's world appeared at the same time, beginning with Arthur Conan Doyle's \"The Lost World\" (1912) and the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs. \"The Lost World\" crossed into the movies in 1925, setting heights for special effects and attempts at scientific accuracy. It is unusual, even today, for attempting to portray dinosaurs as something other than monsters in constant combat.\n\nThe stop-motion techniques of Willis O'Brien went on to bring dinosaurs to life in the 1933 film \"King Kong\", which merged the tropes of dinosaur combat and dinosaurs in a lost world. His protégé Ray Harryhausen would continue to refine this method, but most later dinosaurs movies until the advent of CGI would eschew such expensive effects for cheaper methods, such as humans in dinosaur suits and modern reptiles with dinosaur decorations, enlarged by cinematography. Dinosaur depictions diversified in the 1930s, spreading to newspaper comic strips in \"Alley Oop\" and to advertising for Sinclair Oil.\n\nThe Great Depression and World War II combined to sink the study of dinosaurs into a decades-long lull. Scientists considered dinosaurs a group of unrelated animals that left no descendants, and dinosaurs were presented as stupid, slow, stuck in swamps, and doomed to extinction. Scientific dinosaur artwork, primarily from Rudolph F. Zallinger and Zdeněk Burian, reflected and reinforced the conception of dinosaurs as slow and static (one artistic quirk that became commonplace in representations of Mesozoic landscapes, the presence of a volcano, was a hallmark of Zallinger's). From such ideas came the alternate use of \"dinosaur\" as something out of date.\n\nFilms of the time typically used dinosaurs as monsters, with the added element of atomic fears in the early Cold War. Thus, \"The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms\" (1953) and \"Godzilla\" (1954; American release 1956) portray monstrous dinosaur-like prehistoric reptiles that go on rampages after being awakened by atomic bomb tests. An alternative appears in Disney's animated \"Fantasia\" (1940), in its \"The Rite of Spring\" sequence, which attempted to portray dinosaurs with some scientific accuracy (although it has the common error of showing prehistoric animals from many different time periods living at the same time) and also in Karel Zeman's \"Cesta do praveku\" (1955; \"Journey to the Beginning of Time\"), a Czechoslovakian children's science fiction movie inspired by Zdeněk Burian's work.\nIn 1956, Oliver Butterworth authored a children's book, \"The Enormous Egg\". The book and a movie adaptation televised in 1968 by the NBC Children's Theatre tell the story of a boy who finds an enormous egg laid by a hen that hatches a baby \"Triceratops\". The dinosaur, named \"Uncle Beazley\", becomes too big, so the boy brings him to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. Beazley is first kept at the National Museum of Natural History, but is eventually transferred to the National Zoo's Elephant House because there is a law against stabling large animals in the District of Columbia.\n\nDinosaurs gained a home in television in the 1960s animated sitcom \"The Flintstones\", in another example of dinosaurs shown as coexisting with humans (for comedic effect in this case). Dinosaurs also entered comic books in this period in such series as \"Tor\" and \"Turok, Son of Stone\", where prehistoric humans fought anachronistic dinosaurs. For those wanting more scientific accounts of dinosaurs, there were the first nontechnical dinosaur books. Ned Colbert's \"The Dinosaur Book\" (1945) was the first such book, and its status as the only such book for many years made Colbert an important figure for the coming generations of paleontologists and dinosaur enthusiasts.\n\nIn the 1960s, paleontologist John Ostrom began work on the theropod \"Deinonychus\". His findings, which were expanded upon by his student Robert T. Bakker, contributed to the Dinosaur Renaissance, a revolution in the study of dinosaurs. Of particular importance were a reevaluation of the origin of birds that showed them to be closely related to coelurosaurian dinosaurs, reappraisal of dinosaur physiology that suggested they weren't the sluggish cold-blooded animals they'd long been assumed to be, and a recognition that dinosaurs formed a natural group.\n\nSoon thereafter came new evidence on dinosaur social behavior, with nests of \"Maiasaura\" suggesting parental care. These findings were reflected in the work of a new generation of paleoartists. One milestone was Sarah Landry's feathered dinosaur in Bakker's 1975 \"Scientific American\" article, \"Dinosaur Renaissance\".\n\nLouis Paul Jonas created the first full sized dinosaur sculptures for the 1964 New York World's Fair in the \"Dinoland\" area, which was sponsored by the Sinclair Oil Corporation, whose logo featured a dinosaur. Jonas consulted with paleontologists Barnum Brown, Edwin H. Colbert and John Ostrom in order to create nine sculptures that were as accurate as possible. After the Fair closed, the dinosaur models toured the country on flatbed trailers as part of a company advertising campaign. Most of the statues are now on display at various museums and parks.\nIn 1967, the Sinclair Oil Corporation gave one of its dinosaurs, a fiberglass model of a \"Triceratops\", to the Smithsonian Institution. The model, which appeared in \"The Enormous Egg\" television movie in 1968 as \"Uncle Beazley\", is now on display at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. From the 1970s to 1994, the statue was located on the National Mall in front of the National Museum of Natural History. (Some sources state that the Kentucky Science Center in Louisville (formerly named the \"Louisville Museum of Natural History and Science\" and the \"Louisville Science Center\") now owns the \"Triceratops\" model).\n\nThe reevaluation of dinosaurs spurred public interest, with the new generation of paleoartists quick to respond. Artists such as Mark Hallett, Doug Henderson, John Gurche, Gregory S. Paul, William Stout, and Bob Walters illustrated the new findings in response to the demand.\n\nBy the latter half of the 1980s and into the 1990s, other media were showing the influence of the increased popularity, with diverse depictions aimed at a variety of ages and interests.\nIn 1990 the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., featured an exhibition of dinosaur sculpture by Jim Gary that drew more visitors than any of its previous exhibits. His \"Twentieth Century Dinosaurs\", popular since the 1960s, began being featured in textbooks, encyclopedias, and videos as well as later, by the likes of National Geographic, in their publications for children in 1975.\n\nFor preschoolers, there was the educational television show \"Barney & Friends\" starting in 1992; their older siblings had the 1988 animated movie \"The Land Before Time\" and its increasing line of direct to video sequels (13 by 2016). \"Dinosaurs\", a television sitcom, parodied humans and other television shows. Of particular note is Michael Crichton's 1990 novel, \"Jurassic Park\", the popularity of which led to a series of films and other media. The first of these, \"Jurassic Park\", married advanced CGI with advances in scientific knowledge of dinosaurs. \"Dinosaur\" was the most expensive movie in 2000, but was a box-office success. The falling cost of computer-generated effects also has recently allowed the increased production of documentaries for television; the award-winning 1999 BBC series \"Walking with Dinosaurs\", the 2001 \"When Dinosaurs Roamed America\", the 2003 \"Dinosaur Planet\", the 2009 \"Animal Armageddon\", and the 2011 \"Planet Dinosaur\" are notable examples.\n\nIn April 2016, a proposal was submitted to the Unicode committee to encode three pictures of heads of three dinosaur species considered exemplary as emoji.\n\nThe popular ideals of dinosaurs have many misconceptions, reinforced by films, books, comics, television shows, and even theme parks. Typical errors include: prehistoric humans living with dinosaurs; dinosaurs as monsters that did little else but fight; the portrayal of a kind of \"prehistoric world\" where all prehistoric animals are shown to exist; dinosaurs as all large; dinosaurs as stupid and slow-moving; dinosaurs as being lizard-like and all scaled (non-feathered) when many theropod dinosaurs such as \"Velociraptor\" had feathers, and the inclusion of many prehistoric animals (such as \"Dimetrodon\", ichthyosaurs, mosasaurs, pterosaurs, and plesiosaurs) as dinosaurs; Moreover, dinosaurs did not become extinct due to being generally maladapted or unable to cope with normal climatic change, a view found in many older textbooks. \n\nReports in the news media of dinosaur finds and dinosaur science are often inaccurate and sensationalistic, and popular dinosaur books usually lag scientific understanding. Dinosaur toys and models are often inaccurate, packaged indiscriminately with other prehistoric animals, or have fictitious additions like the large sharp teeth in some rubber \"Triceratops\" toys.\n\nThe pejorative use of \"dinosaur\" as something behind the times has been applied to people, styles, and ideas that are perceived to be out of date, and on the wane. For example, members of the punk movement derided the \"progressive\" bands that preceded them as \"dinosaur bands\".\n\nHowever, some popular depictors have striven for accuracy and presented up-to-date information; Michael Crichton and Bill Watterson (of \"Calvin and Hobbes\") are two recent examples. Paleoartists and illustrators in particular have kept up with research. Popular conceptions of dinosaurs have also been important in stimulating the interest and imagination of young people, and have been responsible for introducing many who would later become paleontologists to the field. In addition, popular depictions have the freedom to be more imaginative and speculative than technical works.\n\nThe typical use of dinosaurs in popular culture has been as vicious monsters. There are several distinct genres of dinosaur depictions commonly used: \"lost worlds\" on modern Earth; time travel stories; educational works for children; prehistoric world stories (often with cavemen); and dinosaurs running amok in the modern world.\n\nThe appeal of dinosaurs, as suggested by author, researcher, and dinosaur enthusiast Donald F. Glut, has multiple factors. Dinosaurs were \"monsters,\" yet are safely extinct, allowing for vicarious thrills. They appeal to the imagination, and there are many ways to approach them intellectually. Finally, they appeal to adults nostalgic for what they enjoyed as children. Children have been particularly drawn to dinosaurs over the years.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "51512", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51512", "title": "Etiquette", "text": "Etiquette\n\nEtiquette ( or , ) is a code of behavior that delineates expectations for social behavior according to contemporary conventional norms within a society, social class, or group.\n\nThe French word \"étiquette\", literally signifying a tag or label, was used in a modern sense in English around 1750. Etiquette is behaviour that assists survival and has changed and evolved over the years.\n\nIn the 3rd millennium BC, Ptahhotep wrote \"The Maxims of Ptahhotep\". The Maxims were conformist precepts extolling such civil virtues as truthfulness, self-control and kindness towards one's fellow beings. Learning by listening to everybody and knowing that human knowledge is never perfect are a leitmotif. Avoiding open conflict wherever possible should not be considered weakness. Stress is placed on the pursuit of justice, although it is conceded that it is a god's command that prevails in the end. Some of the maxims refer to one's behaviour when in the presence of the great, how to choose the right master and how to serve him. Others teach the correct way to lead through openness and kindness. Greed is the base of all evil and should be guarded against, while generosity towards family and friends is deemed praiseworthy.\n\nConfucius (551–479 BC) was a Chinese teacher, editor, politician, and philosopher whose philosophy emphasized personal and governmental morality, correctness of social relationships, justice and sincerity.\n\nBaldassare Castiglione (Italian: [baldasˈsaːre kastiʎˈʎoːne]; December 6, 1478 – February 2, 1529), count of Casatico, was an Italian courtier, diplomat, soldier and a prominent Renaissance author, who is probably most famous for his authorship of The Book of the Courtier. The work was an example of a courtesy book, dealing with questions of the etiquette and morality of the courtier, and was very influential in 16th century European court circles.\n\nLouis XIV (1638–1718) \"transformed a royal hunting lodge in Versailles, a village 25 miles southwest of the capital, into one of the largest palaces in the world, officially moving his court and government there in 1682. It was against this awe-inspiring backdrop that Louis tamed the nobility and impressed foreign dignitaries, using entertainment, ceremony and a highly codified system of etiquette to assert his supremacy.”\n\nDuring the Enlightenment era, a self-conscious process of the imposition of polite norms and behaviours became a symbol of being a genteel member of the upper class. Upwardly mobile middle class bourgeoisie increasingly tried to identify themselves with the elite through their adopted artistic preferences and their standards of behaviour. They became preoccupied with precise rules of etiquette, such as when to show emotion, the art of elegant dress and graceful conversation and how to act courteously, especially with women. Influential in this new discourse was a series of essays on the nature of politeness in a commercial society, penned by the philosopher Lord Shaftesbury in the early 18th century. Shaftesbury defined politeness as the art of being pleasing in company:\n\nPeriodicals, such as \"The Spectator\", founded as a daily publication by Joseph Addison and Richard Steele in 1711, gave regular advice to its readers on how to conform to the etiquette required of a polite gentleman. Its stated goal was \"to enliven morality with wit, and to temper wit with morality... to bring philosophy out of the closets and libraries, schools and colleges, to dwell in clubs and assemblies, at tea-tables and coffeehouses\" It provided its readers with educated, topical talking points, and advice in how to carry on conversations and social interactions in a polite manner.\n\nThe allied notion of 'civility' – referring to a desired social interaction which valued sober and reasoned debate on matters of interest – also became an important quality for the 'polite classes'. Established rules and procedures for proper behaviour as well as etiquette conventions, were outlined by gentlemen's clubs, such as Harrington's Rota Club. Periodicals, including \"The Tatler\" and \"The Spectator\", infused politeness into English coffeehouse conversation, as their explicit purpose lay in the reformation of English manners and morals. Etiquette is the virtue of morality and code of behaviour.\nIt was Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield who first used the word 'etiquette' in its modern meaning, in his \"Letters to His Son on the Art of Becoming a Man of the World and a Gentleman\". This work comprised over 400 letters written from 1737 or 1738 and continuing until his son's death in 1768, and were mostly instructive letters on various subjects. The letters were first published by his son's widow Eugenia Stanhope in 1774. Chesterfield endeavoured to decouple the issue of manners from conventional morality, arguing that mastery of etiquette was an important weapon for social advancement. The Letters were full of elegant wisdom and perceptive observation and deduction. Chesterfield epitomised the restraint of polite 18th-century society, writing, for instance, in 1748:\nBy the Victorian era, etiquette had developed into an exceptionally complicated system of rules, governing everything from the proper method for writing letters and using cutlery to the minutely regulated interactions between different classes and gender.\n\nManners are described as good or bad to indicate whether or not a behavior is socially acceptable. Every culture adheres to a different set of manners, although a lot of manners are cross-culturally common. Manners are a subset of social norms which are informally enforced through self-regulation and social policing and publicly performed. They enable human ‘ultrasociality’ by imposing self-restraint and compromise on regular, everyday actions.\n\nIn his book The Civilizing Process, Norbert Elias argued that manners arose as a product of group living and persist as a way of maintaining social order. He theorized that manners proliferated during the Renaissance in response to the development of the ‘absolute state’ – the progression from small group living to the centralization of power by the state. Elias believed that the rituals associated with manners in the Court Society of England during this period were closely bound with social status. To him, manners demonstrate an individual’s position within a social network and act as a means by which the individual can negotiate that position.\n\nPetersen and Lupton argue that manners helped reduce the boundaries between the public sphere and the private sphere and gave rise to \"“a highly reflective self, a self who monitors his or her behavior with due regard for others with whom he or she interacts socially.”\" They explain that; \"“The public behavior of \"individuals came to signify their social standing, a means of presenting the self and of evaluating others and thus the control of the outward self was\"\n\"vital.”\" From this perspective, manners are seen not just as a means of displaying one’s social status, but also as a\nmeans of maintaining social\nboundaries relative to class and identity.\n\nPierre Bourdieu’s notion of \"‘habitus’\" can also contribute to the understanding of manners. The habitus, he explains, is a set of \"‘dispositions’\" that are\nneither self-determined, nor pre-determined, by external environmental factors. They tend to operate at a subconscious level and are \"“inculcated through experience and explicit teaching”\" and produced and reproduced by social interactions. Manners, in this view, are likely to be a central part of the \"‘dispositions’\" which guide an individual’s ability to make socially compliant behavioral decisions.\n\nAnthropologists concern themselves primarily with detailing cultural variances and differences in \"‘ways of seeing’.\" Theorists such as Mary Douglas have\nclaimed that each culture’s unique set of manners, behaviors and rituals enable the local cosmology to remain ordered and free from those things that may pollute or\ndefile it. In particular, she suggests that ideas of pollution and disgust are attached to the margins of socially acceptable behavior to curtail such actions and\nmaintain\"“ the assumptions by which experience is controlled.”\"\n\nEvolutionary biology looks at the origin of behavior and the motivation behind it. Charles Darwin analyzed the remarkable universality of facial responses to disgust, shame and other complex emotions. Having identified the same behavior in young infants and blind individuals he concluded that these responses are not learned but innate. According to Val Curtis, the development of these responses was concomitant with the development of manners behavior. For Curtis, manners play an evolutionary role in the prevention of disease. This assumes that those who were hygienic, polite to others and most able to benefit from their membership within a cultural group, stand the best\nchance of survival and reproduction.\n\nCatherine Cottrell and Steven Neuberg explore how our behavioral responses to ‘otherness’ may enable the preservation of manners and norms. They suggest that the foreignness or unfamiliarity we experience when interacting with different cultural groups for the first time, may partly serve an evolutionary function: \"“Group living surrounds one with individuals able to physically harm fellow group members, to spread contagious disease, or to “free ride” on their efforts. A commitment to sociality thus carries a risk: If threats such as these are left unchecked, the costs of sociality will quickly exceed its benefits. Thus, to maximize the returns on group \"living, individual group members should be attuned to others’ features or behaviors.”\"\n\nThus, people who possess similar traits, common to the group, are to be trusted, whereas those who do not are to be considered as ‘others’ and treated with suspicion or even exclusion. Curtis argues that selective pressure borne out of a shift towards communal living would have resulted in individuals being shunned from the group for hygiene lapses or uncooperative behavior. This would have led to people avoiding actions that might result in embarrassment or others being disgusted. Joseph Henrich and Robert Boyd developed a\nmodel to demonstrate this process at work. They explain natural selection has favored the acquisition of genetically transmitted learning mechanisms that increase an individual’s chance of acquiring locally adaptive behavior. They hypothesize that: \"“Humans possess a reliably developing neural encoding that compels them both to punish individuals who violate group norms (common beliefs or practices) and punish individuals who do not punish norm violators.”\" From this approach, manners are a means of mitigating undesirable behavior and fostering the benefits of in-group cooperation.\n\nCurtis also specifically outlines three manner categories; hygiene, courtesy and cultural norms, each of which help to account for the multifaceted role manners play in society.\nThese categories are based on the outcome rather than the motivation of manners behavior and individual manner behaviors may fit into 2 or more categories.\n\nHygiene Manners – are any manners which affect disease transmission. They are likely to be taught at an early age, primarily through parental discipline, positive behavioral\nenforcement of continence with bodily fluids (such as toilet training), and the avoidance or removal of items that pose a disease risk for children. It is expected that,\nby adulthood, hygiene manners are so entrenched in one’s behavior that they become second nature. Violations are likely to elicit disgust responses.\n\nCourtesy Manners – demonstrate one’s ability to put the interests of others before oneself; to display self-control and good intent for the purposes of being trusted\nin social interactions. Courtesy manners help to maximize the benefits of group living by regulating social interaction. Disease avoidance behavior can sometimes be compromised in the performance of courtesy manners. They may be taught in the same way as hygiene manners but are likely to also be learned through direct,\nindirect (i.e. observing the interactions of others) or imagined (i.e. through the executive functions of the brain) social interactions. The learning of courtesy manners may take place\nat an older age than hygiene manners, because individuals must have at least some means of communication and some awareness of self and social positioning.\nThe violation of courtesy manners most commonly results in social disapproval from peers.\n\nCultural Norm Manners – typically demonstrate one’s identity within a specific socio-cultural group. Adherence to cultural norm manners allows for the demarcation of socio-cultural identities and the creation of boundaries which inform who is to be trusted or who is to be deemed as ‘other’. Cultural norm manners are learnt through the enculturation and routinisation of ‘the familiar’ and through exposure to ‘otherness’ or those who are identified as foreign or different. Transgressions and non-adherence to cultural norm manners commonly result in alienation. Cultural norms, by their very nature, have a high level of between-group variability but are likely to be common to all those who identify with a given group identity.\n\nRules of etiquette encompass most aspects of social interaction in any society, though the term itself is not commonly used. A rule of etiquette may reflect an underlying ethical code, or it may reflect a person's fashion or status. Rules of etiquette are usually unwritten, but aspects of etiquette have been codified from time to time.\n\nBaldassare Castiglione was an Italian courtier, diplomat, soldier and a prominent Renaissance author, who is probably most famous for his authorship of The Book of the Courtier. The work was an example of a courtesy book, dealing with questions of the etiquette and morality of the courtier, and was very influential in 16th century European court circles.\n\nErasmus of Rotterdam published his book \"On Good Manners for Boys\" in 1530. Amid his advice for young children on fidgeting, yawning, bickering and scratching he highlights that a core tenet of manners is the ability to “\"readily ignore the faults of others but avoid falling short yourself\"”.\n\nIn centuries since then, many authors have tried to collate manners or etiquette guide books. One of the most famous of these was Emily Post who began to document etiquette in 1922. She described her work as detailing the “\"trivialities\"” of desirable everyday conduct but also provided descriptions of appropriate conduct for key life events such as baptisms, weddings and funerals. She later established an institute which continues to provide updated advice on how to negotiate modern day society with good manners and decorum. The most recent edition of her book provides advice on such topics as when it is acceptable to ‘unfriend’ someone on Facebook and who is entitled to which armrest when flying. Etiquette books such as these as well as those by Amy Vanderbilt, Hartley, Judith Martin, and Sandi Toksvig outline suggested behaviours for a range of social interactions. However, all note that to be a well-mannered person one must not merely read their books but be able to employ good manners fluidly in any situation that may arise. How Rude! is an American series of comic manners books for teens.\n\nThe etiquette of business is the set of written and unwritten rules of conduct that make social interactions run more smoothly. Office etiquette in particular applies to coworker interaction, excluding interactions with external contacts such as customers and suppliers. When conducting group meetings in the United States, the assembly might follow \"Robert's Rules of Order\", if there are no other company policies to control a meeting.\n\nThese rules are often echoed throughout an industry or economy. For instance, 49% of employers surveyed in 2005 by the American National Association of Colleges and Employers found that non-traditional attire would be a \"strong influence\" on their opinion of a potential job candidate. Business Etiquette at companies such as IBM influence global business etiquette and professional standards.\n\nBoth office and business etiquette overlap considerably with basic tenets of netiquette, the social conventions for using computer networks.\n\nBusiness etiquette can vary significantly in different countries, which is invariably related to their culture. For example: A notable difference between Chinese and Western business etiquette is conflict handling. Chinese businesses prefer to look upon relationship management to avoid conflicts – stemming from a culture that heavily relies on \"guanxi\" (personal connections) – while the west leaves resolution of conflict to the interpretations of law through contracts and lawyers.\n\nAdjusting to foreign etiquettes is a major complement of culture shock, providing a market for manuals. Other resources include business and diplomacy institutions, available only in certain countries such as the UK.\n\nIn 2011, a group of etiquette experts and international business group formed a non-profit organization called IITTI (pronounced as \"ET\") to help human resource (HR) departments of multinationals in measuring the etiquette skills of prospective new employees during the recruitment process by standardizing image and etiquette examination, similar to what ISO does for industrial process measurements.\n\nEtiquette in retail is sometimes summarized as \"The customer is always right.\" \n\nEtiquette is dependent on culture; what is excellent etiquette in one society may shock another. Etiquette evolves within culture. The Dutch painter Andries Both shows that the hunt for head lice (\"illustration, right\"), which had been a civilized grooming occupation in the early Middle Ages, a bonding experience that reinforced the comparative rank of two people, one groomed the other, one was the subject of the groomer, had become a peasant occupation by 1630. The painter portrays the familiar operation matter-of-factly, without the disdain this subject would have received in a 19th-century representation.\n\nEtiquette can vary widely between different cultures and nations. For example, in Hausa culture, eating while standing may be seen as offensively casual and ill-omened behavior, insulting the host and showing a lack of respect for the scarcity of food—the offense is known as \"eating with the devil\" or \"committing \"santi\".\" In China, a person who takes the last item of food from a common plate or bowl without first offering it to others at the table may be seen as a glutton who is insulting the host's generosity. Traditionally, if guests do not have leftover food in front of them at the end of a meal, it is to the dishonour of the host. In the United States of America, a guest is expected to eat all of the food given to them, as a compliment to the quality of the cooking. However, it is still considered polite to offer food from a common plate or bowl to others at the table.\n\nIn such rigid hierarchal cultures as Korea and Japan, alcohol helps to break down the strict social barrier between classes. It allows for a hint of informality to creep in. It is traditional for host and guest to take turns filling each other's cups and encouraging each other to gulp it down. For someone who does not consume alcohol (except for religious reasons), it can be difficult escaping the ritual of the social drink.\n\nEtiquette is a topic that has occupied writers and thinkers in all sophisticated societies for millennia, beginning with a behavior code by Ptahhotep, a vizier in ancient Egypt's Old Kingdom during the reign of the Fifth Dynasty king Djedkare Isesi (c. 2414–2375 BC). All known literate civilizations, including ancient Greece and Rome, developed rules for proper social conduct. Confucius included rules for eating and speaking along with his more philosophical sayings.\n\nEarly modern conceptions of what behavior identifies a \"gentleman\" were codified in the 16th century, in a book by Baldassare Castiglione, \"Il Cortegiano\" (\"The Courtier\"); its codification of expectations at the court of Urbino remained in force in its essentials until World War I. Louis XIV established an elaborate and rigid court ceremony, but distinguished himself from the high bourgeoisie by continuing to eat, stylishly and fastidiously, with his fingers. An important book about etiquette is \"Il Galateo\" by Giovanni della Casa; in fact, in Italian, etiquette is generally called \"galateo\" (or \"etichetta\" or \"protocollo\").\n\nIn the American colonies, Benjamin Franklin and George Washington wrote codes of conduct for young gentlemen. The immense popularity of advice columns and books by Letitia Baldrige and Miss Manners shows the currency of this topic. Even more recently, the rise of the Internet has necessitated the adaptation of existing rules of conduct to create Netiquette, which governs the drafting of e-mail, rules for participating in an online forum, and so on.\n\nIn Germany, many books dealing with etiquette, especially dining, dressing etc., are called \"the Knigge\", named after Adolph Freiherr Knigge who wrote the book \"Über den Umgang mit Menschen\" (\"On Human Relations\") in the late 18th century. However, this book is about good manners and also about the social state of its time, but not about etiquette.\n\nEtiquette may be wielded as a social weapon. The outward adoption of the superficial mannerisms of an in-group, in the interests of social advancement rather than a concern for others, is considered by many a form of snobbery, lacking in virtue.\n\nEtiquette and language\n\nEtiquette and society\n\nWorldwide etiquette\n\n\n"}

It is often abbreviated to FIFO when referring to employment status. This is common in large mining regions in Australia and Canada.\n\nSimilar to the fly-in fly-out roster is the DIDO roster, drive-in drive-out, which has essentially the same benefits and negatives.\n\nRather than relocating employees and their families to a town near the work site, the employees are flown to the work site, where they work for a number of days, and are then flown back to their hometowns for a number of days of rest.\n\nFly-in fly-out is very commonly used in the mining industry, as mines are often in areas far from towns. Employers prefer it when the cost of establishing permanent communities (of sufficient quality to attract families to live locally) will exceed the cost of airfares and temporary housing on the work site. Generally, such sites use portable buildings since there is no long-term commitment to that location (e.g., the mine will close once the minerals have been extracted).\n\nUsually, a fly-in fly-out job involves working a long shift (e.g., 12 hours each day) for a number of continuous days with all days off spent at home rather than at the work site. As the employee's work days are almost entirely taken up by working, sleeping, and eating, there is little need for any recreation facilities at the work site. However, companies are increasingly offering facilities such as pools, tennis courts, and gyms as a way of attracting and retaining skilled staff. Employees like such arrangements since their families are often reluctant to relocate to small towns in remote areas where there might be limited opportunities for spouses' employment, limited educational choices for children, and poor recreational facilities.\n\nFly-in fly-out employment can put stress on family relationships, and the phenomenon may stifle regional development.\n\nThe impact of absent FIFO parents (primarily fathers) on their children and schooling has yet to be the subject of a major study, but it is likely that the separation anxiety experienced by the children of FIFO workers is similar to that of military families before, during and after deployment. Research published in Australia in 2014 suggests that children of fly-in fly-out parents suffer emotionally from the parent's absence, more frequently become the targets of schoolyard bullying, and may evince additional bad behaviour. However, such children often receive greater incentive to succeed academically, and some such children appreciate the extended time at home available for FIFO parents.\n\nThere is a high mental cost to the workers and their families, with several government inquiries into its detrimental effects.\n\nA federal inquiry into fly-in fly-out and drive-in drive-out in Australia in 2012 found that it can lead to an increase in substance abuse, sexually transmitted infections, and mental illness in workers on a FIFO roster, especially in Western Australia, where the number of people on such a roster is in excess of 50,000.\n\nA Queensland inquiry into the effects of fly-in fly-out was conducted in 2016.\n\nIn 2015, the Western Australian government instituted a support policy for FIFO workers.\n\nMining companies like Fortescue Metals Group estimate that it would cost the company an additional $100,000 per person per year to employ them in residential positions rather than as FIFO workers. In Port Hedland alone the company could save $33 million a year if it was to convert its 330-strong work force from residential to FIFO, the company estimates. The much higher cost of employing residential workers is caused by high real estate prices, slow release of land for residential development and high cost of living subsidies and forces mining companies to rely on FIFO rather than residential workers. Such a strategy has been employed in some mining towns that once had a considerable size. For example, Wiluna in Western Australia had a population of 9,000 in 1938, but now has a population of 300, with almost all employees of the local mines on fly-in fly-out rosters.\n\nMining companies such as Rio Tinto have said that it is also the government's responsibility to deal with the side effects of fly-in fly-out, including housing shortages and the need to develop further infrastructure in the mining regions such as hospitals and schools to fulfil demand, as the Government highly benefits from increased tax and royalties income through the mining boom. Rio Tinto paid $5 billion in corporate tax and in excess of $2 billion in state royalties in 2011.\n\n\n"}

Food waste is defined as all inedible and edible parts of food that creates preceding and succeeding food processing, production and consumption. Greenhouse gases, especially methane can be reduced by food waste recycling. Food waste recycling can also alleviate the saturation of landfill sites in Hong Kong.\n\nThe amount of food waste accounts for 38% of the municipal solid waste in Hong Kong. According to the statistics published by the Environmental Protection Department, Hong Kong generates approximately 3,648 tonnes of food waste each day. About one-third of the food waste comes from the commercial and industrial sectors while the remaining part is from households. The situation of food waste disposal in Hong Kong has become more serious in recent years. The amount of food waste from the commercial and industry sectors increased from 400 tonnes in 2002 to 1033 tonnes in 2014.\n\nFood waste recycling typically involves a three-step strategy that includes separation, collection and recycling. These three steps are interdependent and equally important in efficiently generating useful resources from food waste recycling.\n\nThe collected food waste is separated into two categories: pre-consumer food waste and post-consumer food waste. Pre-consumer food waste includes animal food waste, vegetable food waste, and waste from industrially-processed food. Post-consumer food waste refers to leftover food, such as from an unfinished restaurant order. Source separation also involves removing any food packaging and utensils.\n\nFood waste vehicles, managed by the government, collect and deliver food waste to governmental recycling facilities. These recycling facilities, known as Organic Waste Treatment Facilities (OWTFs), will be spread across Hong Kong's districts. The government plans to construct 5 to 6 OWTF networks, with a goal of recycling 1300 to 1500 tonnes of food waste between 2014 and 2024. The first facility is planned to be built in Siu Ho Wan to serve Lantau Island and districts nearby. The second and third are projected to be built in Sha Ling and Shek Kong so as to serve the New Territories and West Kowloon.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Department also plans to construct two Organic Resources Recovery Centres (ORRCs) to collect the food waste and turn it into compost for recovery. These two centres will collectively be able to treat 500 tonnes of organic waste and divert 200 to 300 tonnes of waste from the landfills daily. The first Centre will also be located in Siu Ho Wan. The construction works commenced in December 2014 and it is expected to be commissioned in early 2018.\n\nTwo technologies are used to turn food waste into biogas and useful products. The first technology is a low-carbon method that processes 100 to 300 of tonnes food waste per day. By applying this technology, it produces a source of the renewable energy biogas. It is estimated that the first Centre will be able to provide 14 million kWh of electricity to Hong Kong's power grid every year, which can power 3,000 households. The second technology converts food waste into succinic acid by using enzymes and bacteria. The residues can be processed to be animal feed, fertilizers and environmental-friendly cleansing products.\n\nFood waste recycling partnership scheme is introduced by the Environmental Protection Department in 2009. The scheme was designed to promote a good practice on food waste management and enhance people’s experiences of separating and recycling food waste sources. The scheme collaborated with commercial and industrial sectors. Some members from the Hong Kong Government and that of the commercial and industrial sectors formed a working group for planning and managing the operation of the project. There are about 20 to 30 public and private organizations that participate in the scheme every year. In the project, all the participants will have a chance to practice separation process of food waste sources. The collection process of separated food waste will be carried out by the Environmental Protection Department and the Kowloon Bay Pilot Composting Plant will be responsible to the recycling part. The scheme also consists of discussion sessions for the participating parties to share their experience of recycling food waste. All participants will receive a commendation certificate at the end of the project.\n\nFrom November 2012 to July 2014, The Hong Kong Housing Authority implemented a trial scheme, named as Food Waste Recycling Projects in Housing Estates, with an aim to promote waste recycling in housing estates. The scheme involved 14 estates with about 3200 households. There were two modes adopted in the scheme. One is to convert food waste to fish grain by transporting them to a Central Food Waste Recycling Plant. The other one is to convert food waste into compost for farm by using micro-organisms.\n\nOn 31 March 2012, The Environmental Protection Department introduced a recycling scheme on Cheung Chau and Lamma Island. The purpose of the scheme is to promote and encourage food waste recycling on both islands. Food waste collected from shops and restaurants would be transported to the food waste treatment facilities on the islands. The food waste would be converted to organic compost.\n\nHong Kong Organic Waste Recycling Centre (HKOWRC) was established in 2011 as the first organic waste management consulting firm in Hong Kong. It combines local and foreign technologies to provide one-stop organic recycling services to customers. The assistance in collection of food waste solves problems of companies in immature recycling. Through commitment to different types of people, HKOWRC can promote and provide waste management training for particular customers.\n\nThe objectives of the collection and recycling routine are to educate the general public in cherishing food as well as making good use of resources. The service encourages two-way cooperation for food waste recycling. HKOWRC aims to provide 24-hour recycling services particularly to livestock breeders, farmers, catering industry, schools and large-scale housing estates. For most of the cases, the recycled food waste is to be used by the service targets again for other purposes, therefore avoiding wastage of resources. For livestock breeders and farmers, the recycled food waste is converted to animal feeds and fertilizers that contain richer nutritional values than the conventional ones. It possibly gives higher yield. For catering industry, the recycled food waste is converted to crops which are grown from organic compost from HKOWRC for latest organic food at a special prize. For schools and housing estates, it aims to raise the awareness of food waste reduction when the recycling service reveals the huge amount of food wastes accumulated.\n\n\n"}

Though there was likely literature in Guatemala before the arrival of the Spanish, all the texts that exist today were written after their arrival.\n\nThe Popol Vuh is the most significant work of Guatemalan literature in the Quiché language, and one of the most important of Pre-Columbian American literature. It is a compendium of Mayan stories and legends, aimed to preserve Mayan traditions. The first known version of this text dates from the 16th century and is written in Quiché transcribed in Latin characters. It was translated into Spanish by the Dominican priest Francisco Ximénez in the beginning of the 18th century. Due to its combination of historical, mythical, and religious elements, it has been called the Mayan Bible. It is a vital document for understanding the culture of pre-Columbian America.\n\nThe Rabinal Achí is a dramatic work consisting of dance and text that is preserved as it was originally represented. It is thought to date from the 15th century and narrates the mythical and dynastic origins of the Kek'chi' people, and their relationships with neighboring peoples. The story tells how the prince of the Kek'chi' fights against neighboring tribes and, while he initially defeats them, he later is captured and taken before the king Job'Toj, who gives him back to his people to say goodbye to and dance with his princess for the last time. The Rabinal Achí is performed during the Rabinal festival of January 25, the day of Saint Paul.

Major writers of this era include Sor Juana de Maldonado, considered the first poet playwright of colonial Central America, and the historian Francisco Antonio de Fuentes y Guzmán. The Jesuit Rafael Landívar (1731–1793) is considered as the first great Guatemalan poet. He was forced into exile by Carlos III. He traveled to Mexico and later to Italy, where he died. He originally wrote his Rusticatio Mexicana and his poems praising the bishop Figueredo y Victoria in Latin.\n\nAt this time, traditional poetic forms were developed to be sung. These include the villancico for use on the eves of main religious holidays. These were the only liturgical occasions on which songs in vernacular languages were permitted. (All other events were exclusively in Latin.) In Guatemala, as throughout the Spanish empire, other musical compositions with Spanish lyrics included consisted sainetes, jácaras, tonadas, and cantatas. Authors of these poems, who also put their works to music, include Manuel José de Quirós (ca. 1765-1790), Pedro Nolasco Estrada Aristondo, Pedro Antonio Rojas, and Rafael Antonio Castellanos (ca. 1725-1791). Castellanos is one of the most important in the Hispanic world and in the music of Guatemala.\n\nDuring the 18th century, Guatemalan literature was influenced by French neoclassicism, as is seen in educational and philosophical works by authors such as Rafael García Goyena and Matías de Córdoba.\n\nGuatemala gained independence from Spain in 1821, in its desire to establish political and commercial relations with other countries. The literature during this period is marked by political strife, which dominated the essay and treatise genres. This era also saw the birth of journalism in Guatemala, with figures like Antonio José de Irisarri\n\nDuring the 19th century Guatemalan literature began to develop independently from Spanish literature, though it continued to incorporate European influences. Important writers of this era include María Josefa García Granados and José Batres Montúfar (known simply as \"Pepe Batres\"), who co-wrote the \"Sermón para José María Castilla\", a work that was scandalous at the time. Batres is also the author of the poem \"Yo pienso en ti\", one of the best known of Guatemalan literature.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, the novel dominated Guatemalan literature, thanks especially to José Milla y Vidaurre, considered the father of the Guatemalan novel. He signed some of his works with the pseudonym \"Salomé Jil\", an anagram of his name. Major works by Milla y Vidaurre include \"La hija del Adelantado\" (1866), \"Los Nazarenos\" (1867), \"El visitador\" (1867), and \"El libro sin nombre\".\n\nGuatemalan writers also participated in Latin American modernism, heir to French symbolism and Parnassianism and driven by the Nicaraguan Rubén Darío. In poetry, important writers included Domingo Estrada, Máximo Soto Hall, and María Cruz. The versatile writer Enrique Gómez Carrillo represented modernism in prose.\n\nIn the 20th century, Guatemalan literature reached a level comparable to that of other Latin American countries. The most important Guatemalan writers in this period are novelist Miguel Ángel Asturias (1967 Nobel Prize winner and author of novels including \"El Señor Presidente\" and \"Hombres de Maíz\"), poet Luis Cardoza y Aragón, short story writer and novelist Augusto Monterroso (2000 Príncipe de Asturias prize winner), and playwright Carlos Solórzano. In general, 20th-century Guatemalan literature is strongly influenced by politics, as evidenced by the fact that its authors were forced into exile during Guatemala's successive dictatorships and civil wars.\n\n20th-century Guatemalan literature is usually divided by generation or decade:\n"}

It transfers knowledge of innovative transportation technology to both urban and rural local communities in the United States and to American Indian tribal governments.\n\nThe program is a partnership effort with funding provided from Federal, State, and local agency resources as well as universities and the private sector. Each center is funded by a 50:50 match of state and federal funds, although some states choose to provide more than the minimum required amount. \n\nThere are 58 Technology Transfer (T2) Centers established—one in each State, one serving Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and seven serving American Indian tribal governments—to provide training and technical assistance to local governments. Most centers are run by universities, and a few are hosted by their state's department of transportation. Several, like the Cornell Local Roads Program and Texas LTAP, are part of university-based cooperative extension services. It was founded in 1982, although several centers predate the national program.\n\nLTAP Centers assist nearly 38,000 local government agencies and over 540 federally recognized tribes in maintaining and improving transportation infrastructure and services with the latest technology and information available. Local transportation agencies expend over $30 billion annually to maintain 2.9 million miles of roads [1.3 paved/1.6 unpaved] with over 290,000 bridges.\n\nMany local road departments are managed by individuals who generally have practical experience but little formal technical education or training. LTAP has a variety of tools - training events, technology transfer resources, and personalized assistance - to assist local agencies in improving their transportation operations. Many state transportation departments also benefit from LTAP services. In 2011, LTAP centers trained over 151,000 people in over 5300 sessions.\n\nCommon topics for training and assistance include pavement management and maintenance, road works safety, traffic signs and pavement markings, public works department management, snow and ice control, and drainage. \n\nTwo important factors in LTAP's success are flexibility and networking. Although certain tasks are mandated, like providing a newsletter and a lending library for local highway officials, each LTAP center has considerable leeway in adapting its programs to address the unique challenges faced by the customers it serves.\n\nCenters also work together on many projects. If one center has a pavement specialist on their staff, they may provide training for another state's center, in exchange for work zone training. Also, should a local highway official ask a question that their center can't answer, it can be forwarded to the 57 other centers, as well as related FHWA and State DOT offices. Usually, an answer is supplied within short order.\n\nMap of LTAP centers: https://web.archive.org/web/20120708045803/http://www.ltap.org/centers/\n"}
{"id": "1537611", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1537611", "title": "Mechanical floor", "text": "Mechanical floor\n\nA mechanical floor, mechanical penthouse, mechanical layer or mechanical level is a story of a high-rise building that is dedicated to mechanical and electronics equipment. \"Mechanical\" is the most commonly used term, but words such as \"utility\", \"technical\", \"service\", and \"plant\" are also used. They are present in all tall buildings including the world's tallest skyscrapers with significant structural, mechanical and aesthetics concerns.\n\nWhile most buildings have mechanical rooms, typically in the basement, tall buildings require dedicated floors throughout the structure for this purpose, for a variety of reasons discussed below. Because they use up valuable floor area (just like elevator shafts), engineers try to minimize the number of mechanical floors while allowing for sufficient redundancy in the services they provide. As a rule of thumb, skyscrapers require a mechanical floor for every 10 tenant floors (10%) although this percentage can vary widely (see examples below). In some buildings they are clustered in groups that divide the building into blocks, in others they are spread evenly through the structure, while in others still they are mostly concentrated at the top.\n\nMechanical floors are generally counted in the building's floor numbering (this is required by some building codes) but are accessed only by service elevators. In some legislations they have been excluded from maximum floor area calculations, leading to significant increases in building sizes; this is the case in New York City. Sometimes buildings are designed with a mechanical floor located on the thirteenth floor, to avoid problems in renting the space due to superstitions about that number.\n\nSome skyscrapers have narrow building cores that require stabilization to prevent collapse. Typically this is accomplished by joining the core to the external supercolumns at regular intervals using outrigger trusses. The triangular shape of the struts precludes the laying of tenant floors, so these sections house mechanical floors instead, typically in groups of two. Additional stabilizer elements such as tuned mass dampers also require mechanical floors to contain or service them.\n\nThis layout is usually reflected in the internal elevator zoning. Since nearly all elevators require machine rooms above the last floor they service, mechanical floors are often used to divide shafts that are stacked on top of each other to save space. A transfer level or skylobby is sometimes placed just below those floors.\n\nElevators that reach the top tenant floor also require overhead machine rooms; those are sometimes put into full-size mechanical floors but most often into a mechanical penthouse, which can also contain communications gear and window-washing equipment. On most building designs this is a simple \"box\" on the roof, on others it is concealed inside a decorative spire. A consequence of this is that if the topmost mechanical floors are counted in the total, there can be no such thing as a true \"top-floor office\" in a skyscraper with this design.\n\nBesides structural support and elevator management, the primary purpose of mechanical floors is heating, ventilation and air-conditioning, and other services. They contain electrical generators, chiller plants, water pumps, and so on.\n\nIn particular, the problem of bringing and keeping water on the upper floors is an important constraint in the design of skyscrapers. Water is necessary for tenant use, air conditioning, equipment cooling, and basic firefighting through sprinklers (especially important since ground-based firefighting equipment usually cannot reach higher than a dozen floors or so). It is inefficient, and seldom feasible, for water pumps to send water directly to a height of several hundred meters, so intermediate pumps and water tanks are used. The pumps on each group of mechanical floors act as a relay to the next one up, while the tanks hold water in reserve for normal and emergency use. Usually the pumps have enough power to bypass a level if the pumps there have failed, and send water two levels up.\n\nSpecial care is taken towards fire safety on mechanical floors that contain generators, compressors and elevator machine rooms, since oil is used as either a fuel or lubricant in those elements.\n\nMechanical floors also contain communication and control systems that service the building and sometimes outbound communications, such as through a large rooftop antenna (which is also physically held in place inside the top-floor mechanical levels).\n\nModern computerized HVAC control systems minimize the problem of equipment distribution among floors, by enabling central remote control.\n\nMost mechanical floors require external vents or louvers for ventilation and heat rejection along most or all of their perimeter, precluding the use of glass windows. The resulting visible \"dark bands\" can disrupt the overall facade design especially if it is fully glass-clad. Different architectural styles approach this challenge in different ways.\n\nIn the Modern and International styles of the 1960s and 1970s where form follows function, the vents' presence is not seen as undesirable. Rather it emphasizes the functional layout of the building by dividing it neatly into equal blocks, mirroring the layout of the elevators and offices inside. This could be clearly seen on the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center and can be seen on the Willis Tower. In the IDS Tower in Minneapolis, the lowest mechanical floor serves as a visual separation from the street- and skyway-level Crystal Court shopping center and the office tower above; the upper mechanical floor (above the 50th and 51st floors, the uppermost occupied floors) serves as a \"crown\" to the building.\n\nConversely, designers of the recent postmodern-style skyscrapers strive to mask the vents and other mechanical elements in clever and ingenious ways. This is accomplished through such means as complex wall angles (Petronas Towers), intricate latticework cladding (Jin Mao Building), or non-glassed sections that appear to be ornamental (Taipei 101, roof of Jin Mao Building).\n\nThese are examples of above-ground mechanical floor layouts for some of the world's tallest buildings. In each case, mechanical penthouses and spires are counted as floors, leading to higher total floor counts than usual.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42750115", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42750115", "title": "Mulaney", "text": "Mulaney\n\nMulaney is an American sitcom that aired on Fox from October 5, 2014 to February 15, 2015. Stand-up comedian and former \"Saturday Night Live\" writer John Mulaney created the show and starred as a fictionalized version of himself. At the beginning of each episode, and sometimes throughout, Mulaney would perform stand-up comedy to the studio audience. The show suffered from low ratings and poor critical reviews, and was cancelled in March 2015.\n\nJohn Mulaney is a comedian living in New York City with his roommates—Jane (Nasim Pedrad), a personal trainer with emotional issues, and Motif (Seaton Smith), a fellow stand-up comedian. John often receives advice from his elderly Jewish neighbor Oscar (Elliott Gould), and visits from his odd and annoying friend Andre (Zack Pearlman), a small-time drug dealer. John's life changes when he's hired as a writer for Lou Cannon (Martin Short), an eccentric, legendary comedian and game show host.\n\n\n\n\nThe show was originally taped as a pilot for NBC, but was not picked up. Mulaney re-tooled the pilot, and then pitched it to Fox, who picked the show up with a cautious six-episode commitment. Fox later ordered an additional ten episodes. A trailer was released on May 12, 2014, along with an announcement that the show would air Sunday nights at 9:30 p.m., replacing the Seth MacFarlane sitcom, \"American Dad!\", which moved to TBS. The series premiered October 5, 2014.\n\nOn October 18, 2014, the day before the third episode was supposed to air, Fox announced it was cutting three episodes from its order. This resulted in the production of \"Mulaney\" being shut down, as the thirteenth episode had already been filmed and production of the fourteenth was about to begin. Less than a month later, Fox moved \"Mulaney\" into the 7:30 PM timeslot where \"Bob's Burgers\" had been airing. The season ended on February 15, 2015 and Fox announced \"Mulaney\"s cancellation shortly thereafter.\n\nEven before \"Mulaney\" aired, critics were wary of the direction of the show. After viewing the show's trailer, Eric Dodds with \"TIME\" magazine penned an article called, \"8 Ways the Trailer for \"Mulaney\" Resembles \"Seinfeld\",\" and said it could \"trigger a little déjà vu.\" In regard to its multi-camera format, Canadian magazine \"Maclean's\" asked, \"why would a cool comic pick such an uncool format?\"\n\nUltimately, the show was universally panned by critics, with most reviews drawing unflattering comparisons to \"Seinfeld\". On Rotten Tomatoes, the show has an approval rating of 17% based on 42 reviews, with an average rating of 4.3/10. The site's critical consensus states, \"John Mulaney, we know Jerry Seinfeld. \"Seinfeld\" was funny. \"Mulaney\", you're no \"Seinfeld\".\" On Metacritic, the series has a weighted average score of 38 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".\n\nJames Poniewozik with \"TIME\" magazine said the show \"seems like something a dutiful student might have produced for his final project in his 'Tropes and Themes in the 1990s Sitcom' class.\" Robert Bianco with \"USA Today\" called the sitcom a \"misfire.\" The show was named the fourth-worst show of 2014 by \"Entertainment Weekly\".\n\n\"Mulaney\" fared poorly commercially as well, with the series premiere only getting 2.3 million viewers, the weakest scores for any of the fall's series premieres. The episode from December 21, 2014, became the lowest rated episode, with fewer than 1 million views; the January 18, 2015 episode, airing after the , became the highest-rated, with over 3 million viewers.\n\n"}
{"id": "49182724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49182724", "title": "Music technology (electric)", "text": "Music technology (electric)\n\nElectric music technology refers to musical instruments and recording devices that use electrical circuits, which are often combined with mechanical technologies. Examples of electric musical instruments include the electro-mechanical electric piano (invented in 1929), the electric guitar (invented in 1931), the electro-mechanical Hammond organ (developed in 1934) and the electric bass (invented in 1935). All of these electric instruments do not produce a sound that is audible by the performer or audience in a performance setting unless they are connected to instrument amplifiers and loudspeaker cabinets, which made them sound loud enough for performers and the audience to hear. Amplifiers and loudspeakers are separate from the instrument in the case of the electric guitar (which uses a guitar amplifier), electric bass (which uses a bass amplifier) and some electric organs (which use a Leslie speaker or similar cabinet) and most electric pianos. Some electric organs and electric pianos include the amplifier and speaker cabinet within the main housing for the instrument.\n\nElectric sound recording and reproduction are electrical or mechanical techniques and devices for the inscription and re-creation of sound waves, such as spoken voice, singing, instrumental music, or sound effects. Acoustic analog recording is achieved by a small microphone diaphragm that can record sound waves on a phonograph (in which a stylus senses grooves on a record) or magnetic tape. The first practical sound recording and reproduction device was the mechanical phonograph cylinder, invented by Thomas Edison in 1877 and patented in 1878. \nThe next major technical development was the invention of the gramophone disc in 1889. For much of the 20th century, records were the most common way of selling sound recordings. The widespread availability of records and the development of radio broadcasting enabled a much larger proportion of people to listen to songs and pieces performed by the top artists, enabling the development of national and even international musical stars. In the 1970s, the compact cassette became a major consumer audio format. Advances in electronic and mechanical miniaturization led to the development of the Sony Walkman, a pocket-sized cassette player introduced in 1979, which allowed consumers to listen to their favourite albums outside of their home.\n\nAn electric piano is an electric musical instrument which produces sounds when a performer presses the keys of the piano-style musical keyboard. Pressing keys causes mechanical hammers to strike metal strings or tines, leading to vibrations which are converted into electrical signals by magnetic pickups, which are then connected to an instrument amplifier and loudspeaker to make a sound loud enough for the performer and audience to hear. Unlike a synthesizer, the electric piano is not an electronic instrument. Instead, it is an electro-mechanical instrument. Some early electric pianos used lengths of wire to produce the tone, like a traditional piano. Smaller electric pianos used short slivers of steel, metal tines or short wires to produce the tone. The earliest electric pianos were invented in the late 1920s; the 1929 \"Neo-Bechstein\" electric grand piano was among the first. Probably the earliest stringless model was Lloyd Loar's Vivi-Tone Clavier. A few other noteworthy producers of electric pianos include Baldwin Piano and Organ Company and the Wurlitzer company.\n\nEarly electric piano recordings include Duke Ellington's in 1955 and Sun Ra's \"India\" as well as other tracks from the 1956 sessions included on his second album \"Super Sonic Jazz\" (aka \"Super Sonic Sounds\"). The popularity of the electric piano began to grow in the late 1950s after Ray Charles's 1959 hit record \"What'd I Say\", reaching its height during the 1970s, after which they were progressively displaced by more lightweight electronic pianos capable of piano-like sounds without the disadvantages of electric pianos' heavy weight and moving mechanical parts. Another factor driving their development and acceptance was the progressive electrification of popular music and the need for a portable keyboard instrument capable of high-volume amplification. Musicians adopted a number of types of domestic electric pianos for rock and pop use. This encouraged their manufacturers to modify them for stage use and then develop models primarily intended for stage use.\n\nDigital electronic stage pianos have largely replaced most of the original electro-mechanical instruments in the 2000s, due to the small size, low weight and versatility of digital instruments, which can produce a huge range of tones besides piano tones (e.g., emulations of Hammond organ sounds, synthesizer sounds, etc.). However, some performers still perform and record with vintage electric pianos. In 2009, Fender Rhodes produced a new line of electro-mechanical pianos, known as the Rhodes Mark 7 followed by an offering from Vintage Vibe.\n\nAn electric guitar is a guitar that uses a pickup to convert the vibration of its strings into electrical impulses. The most common guitar pickup uses the principle of direct electromagnetic induction. The signal generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a loudspeaker, so it is amplified before being sent to a loudspeaker. The output of an electric guitar is an electric signal, and the signal can easily be altered by electronic circuits to add \"color\" to the sound. Often the signal is modified using electronic effects such as reverb and distortion.\n\nInvented in 1931, the electric guitar became a necessity as jazz guitarists sought to amplify their sound in the big band format. Early proponents of the electric guitar on record included Les Paul, Lonnie Johnson, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, T-Bone Walker, and Charlie Christian. During the 1950s and 1960s, the electric guitar became the most important instrument in pop music. It has evolved into an instrument that is capable of a multitude of sounds and styles. It served as a major component in the development of electric blues, rock and roll, rock music, and many other genres of music.\n\nElectric guitar design and construction vary greatly in the shape of the body and the configuration of the neck, bridge, and pickups. Guitars have a fixed bridge or a spring-loaded hinged bridge that lets players bend notes or chords up or down in pitch or perform a vibrato. The sound of a guitar can be modified by new playing techniques such as string bending, tapping, hammering on, using audio feedback, or slide guitar playing. There are several types of electric guitar, including the solid-body guitar, various types of hollow-body guitars, the seven-string guitar, which typically adds a low B string below the low E, and the twelve-string electric guitar, which has six pairs of strings.\n\nPopular music and rock groups often use the electric guitar in two roles: as a rhythm guitar, which provides the chord sequence or progression and sets the beat (as part of a rhythm section), and as a lead guitar, which is used to perform melody lines, melodic instrumental fill passages, and solos.\n\nThe Hammond organ is an electric organ, invented by Laurens Hammond and John M. Hanert and first manufactured in 1935. Various models have been produced, most of which use sliding drawbars to create a variety of sounds. Until 1975, Hammond organs generated sound by creating an electric current from rotating a metal tonewheel near an electromagnetic pickup. Around two million Hammond organs have been manufactured, and it has been described as one of the most successful organs. The organ is commonly used with, and associated with, the Leslie speaker.\n\nThe organ was originally marketed and sold by the Hammond Organ Company to churches as a lower-cost alternative to the wind-driven pipe organ, or instead of a piano. It quickly became popular with professional jazz musicians, who found it a cheaper alternative to the big band. Jimmy Smith's use of the Hammond B-3, with its additional harmonic percussion feature, inspired a generation of organ players, and its use became more widespread in the 1960s and 1970s in rhythm and blues, rock and reggae, as well as being an important instrument in progressive rock.\n\nThe Hammond Organ Company struggled financially during the 1970s as they abandoned tonewheel organs and switched to manufacturing instruments using integrated circuits. These instruments were not as popular with musicians as the tonewheels had been, and the company went out of business in 1985. The Hammond name was purchased by the Suzuki Musical Instrument Corporation, which proceeded to manufacture digital simulations of the most popular tonewheel organs. This culminated in the production of the \"New B-3\" in 2002, which provided an accurate recreation of the original B-3 organ using modern digital technology.\n\nHammond-Suzuki continues to manufacture a variety of organs for both professional players and churches. Other companies, such as Korg, Roland and Clavia, have also achieved success in providing emulations of the original tonewheel organs. The sound of a tonewheel Hammond can also be emulated using modern software such as Native Instruments B4.\n\nThe electric bass (or bass guitar) is a stringed instrument played primarily with the fingers or thumb, by plucking, slapping, popping, strumming, tapping, thumping, or picking with a plectrum, often known as a pick. The bass guitar is similar in appearance and construction to an electric guitar, but with a longer neck and scale length, and four to six strings or courses. The four-string bass, by far the most common, is usually tuned the same as the double bass, which corresponds to pitches one octave lower than the four lowest pitched strings of a guitar (E, A, D, and G). The bass guitar is a transposing instrument, as it is notated in bass clef an octave higher than it sounds (as is the double bass) to avoid excessive ledger lines. Like the electric guitar, the bass guitar is plugged into an amplifier and speaker for live performances.\n\nSince the 1960s, the bass guitar has largely replaced the double bass in popular music as the bass instrument in the rhythm section. While types of bass lines vary widely from one style of music to another, the bassist usually fulfills a similar role: anchoring the harmonic framework and establishing the beat. Many styles of music utilise the bass guitar, including rock, metal, pop, punk rock, country, reggae, gospel, blues, and jazz. It is often a solo instrument in jazz, jazz fusion, Latin, funk, progressive rock and other rock and metal styles.\n\nElectric sound recording and reproduction are electrical or mechanical techniques and devices for the inscription and re-creation of sound waves, such as spoken voice, singing, instrumental music, or sound effects. Acoustic analog recording is achieved by a small microphone diaphragm that can detect changes in atmospheric pressure (acoustic sound waves) and record them as a graphic representation of the sound waves on a medium such as a phonograph (in which a stylus senses grooves on a record). In magnetic tape recording, the sound waves vibrate the microphone diaphragm and are converted into a varying electric current, which is then converted to a varying magnetic field by an electromagnet, which makes a representation of the sound as magnetized areas on a plastic tape with a magnetic coating on it. Analog sound reproduction is the reverse process, with a bigger loudspeaker diaphragm causing changes to atmospheric pressure to form acoustic sound waves. Electrically generated signals may also be recorded directly from devices such as an electric guitar pickup, without the use of acoustic sounds or amplifiers in the recording process (other than the need for musicians to hear herself playing during recording session).\n\nThe first device that could record actual sounds as they passed through the air (but could not play them back—the purpose was only visual study) was the phonautograph, patented in 1857 by Parisian inventor Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville. The earliest known recordings of the human voice are phonautograph recordings, called \"phonautograms\", made in 1857. They consist of sheets of paper with sound-wave-modulated white lines created by a vibrating stylus that cut through a coating of soot as the paper was passed under it.\n\nThe first practical sound recording and reproduction device was the mechanical phonograph cylinder, invented by Thomas Edison in 1877 and patented in 1878. The invention soon spread across the globe and over the next two decades the commercial recording, distribution and sale of sound recordings became a growing new international industry, with the most popular titles selling millions of units by the early 1900s. The development of mass-production techniques enabled cylinder recordings to become a major new consumer item in industrial countries and the cylinder was the main consumer format from the late 1880s until around 1910.\n\nThe next major technical development was the invention of the gramophone disc, generally credited to Emile Berliner and commercially introduced in the United States in 1889, though others had demonstrated similar disk apparatus earlier, most notably Alexander Graham Bell in 1881. Discs were easier to manufacture, transport and store, and they had the additional benefit of being louder (marginally) than cylinders, which by necessity, were single-sided. Sales of the gramophone record overtook the cylinder ca. 1910, and by the end of World War I the disc had become the dominant commercial recording format. In various permutations, the audio disc format became the primary medium for consumer sound recordings until the end of the 20th century, and the double-sided 78 rpm shellac disc was the standard consumer music format from the early 1910s to the late 1950s.\n\nThe long-playing 33 rpm microgroove vinyl record, or \"LP\", was developed at Columbia Records and introduced in 1948. The short-playing but convenient 7-inch 45 rpm microgroove vinyl single was introduced by RCA Victor in 1949. In the US and most developed countries, the two new vinyl formats completely replaced 78 rpm shellac discs by the end of the 1950s, but in some corners of the world the \"78\" lingered on far into the 1960s. Vinyl was much more expensive than shellac, one of several factors that made its use for 78 rpm records very unusual, but with a long-playing disc the added cost was acceptable and the compact \"45\" format required very little material. Vinyl offered improved performance, both in stamping and in playback. If played with a good diamond stylus mounted in a lightweight pickup on a well-adjusted tonearm, it was long-lasting. If protected from dust, scuffs and scratches there was very little noise. Vinyl records were, over-optimistically, advertised as \"unbreakable\". They were not, but they were much less fragile than shellac, which had itself once been touted as \"unbreakable\" compared to wax cylinders.\n\nBetween the invention of the phonograph in 1877 and the advent of digital media, arguably the most important milestone in the history of sound recording was the introduction of what was then called \"electrical recording\", in which a microphone was used to convert the sound into an electrical signal that was amplified and used to actuate the recording stylus. This innovation eliminated the \"horn sound\" resonances characteristic of the acoustical process, produced clearer and more full-bodied recordings by greatly extending the useful range of audio frequencies, and allowed previously unrecordable distant and feeble sounds to be captured.\n\nSound recording began as a purely mechanical process. Except for a few crude telephone-based recording devices with no means of amplification, such as the Telegraphone, it remained so until the 1920s, when several recent radio-related developments in electronics converged to revolutionize the recording process. These included improved microphones and auxiliary devices such as electronic filters, all dependent on electronic amplification to be of practical use in recording. In 1906, Lee De Forest invented the \"Audion\" triode vacuum tube, an electronic valve that could amplify weak electrical signals. By 1915, it was in use in long-distance telephone circuits that made conversations between New York and San Francisco practical. Refined versions of this tube were the basis of all electronic sound systems until the commercial introduction of the first transistor-based audio devices in the 1950s.\n\nAn important field of invention during this period was the tape recorder. Magnetic tape recording uses an amplified electrical audio signal to generate analogous variations of the magnetic field produced by a tape head, which impresses corresponding variations of magnetization on the moving tape. In playback mode, the signal path is reversed, the tape head acting as a miniature electric generator as the varyingly magnetized tape passes over it.\n\nMagnetic tape brought about sweeping changes in both radio and the recording industry. Sound could be recorded, erased and re-recorded on the same tape many times, sounds could be duplicated from tape to tape with only minor loss of quality, and recordings could now be very precisely edited by physically cutting the tape and rejoining it. Within a few years of the introduction of the first commercial tape recorder—the Ampex 200 model, launched in 1948—American musician-inventor Les Paul had invented the first multitrack tape recorder, ushering in another technical revolution in the recording industry. Tape made possible the first sound recordings totally created by electronic means, opening the way for the bold sonic experiments of the Musique Concrète school and avant garde composers like Karlheinz Stockhausen, which in turn led to the innovative pop music recordings of artists such as Frank Zappa, The Beatles and The Beach Boys.\n\nThe ease and accuracy of tape editing, as compared to the cumbersome disc-to-disc editing procedures previously in some limited use, together with tape's consistently high audio quality finally convinced radio networks to routinely prerecord their entertainment programming, most of which had formerly been broadcast live. Also, for the first time, broadcasters, regulators and other interested parties were able to undertake comprehensive audio logging of each day's radio broadcasts. Innovations like multitracking and tape echo allowed radio programs and advertisements to be produced to a high level of complexity and sophistication. The combined impact with innovations such as the endless loop broadcast cartridge led to significant changes in the pacing and production style of radio program content and advertising.\n\nMagnetic tape enabled the development of the first practical commercial sound systems that could record and reproduce high-fidelity stereophonic sound. The experiments with stereo during the 1930s and 1940s were hampered by problems with synchronization. A major breakthrough in practical stereo sound was made by Bell Laboratories, who in 1937 demonstrated a practical system of two-channel stereo, using dual optical sound tracks on film. Major movie studios quickly developed three-track and four-track sound systems, and the first stereo sound recording for a commercial film was made by Judy Garland for the MGM movie \"Listen, Darling\" in 1938.\n\nThe first commercially released movie with a stereo soundtrack was Walt Disney's \"Fantasia\", released in 1940. The 1941 release of Fantasia used the \"Fantasound\" sound system. This system used a separate film for the sound, synchronized with the film carrying the picture. The sound film had four double-width optical soundtracks, three for left, center, and right audio—and a fourth as a \"control\" track with three recorded tones that controlled the playback volume of the three audio channels. Because of the complex equipment this system required, Disney exhibited the movie as a roadshow, and only in the United States. Regular releases of the movie used standard mono optical 35 mm stock until 1956, when Disney released the film with a stereo soundtrack that used the \"Cinemascope\" four-track magnetic sound system.\n\nEMI (UK) was the first company to release commercial stereophonic tapes. They issued their first \"Stereosonic\" tape in 1954. Others quickly followed, under the His Master's Voice and Columbia labels. 161 Stereosonic tapes were released, mostly classical music or lyric recordings. RCA imported these tapes into the US. Two-track stereophonic tapes were more successful in America during the second half of the 1950s. They were duplicated at real time (1:1) or at twice the normal speed (2:1) when later 4-track tapes were often duplicated at up to 16 times the normal speed, providing a lower sound quality in many cases. Early American 2-track stereophonic tapes were very expensive. A typical example is the price list of the Sonotape/Westminster reels: $6.95, $11.95 and $17.95 for the 7000, 9000 and 8000 series respectively. Some HMV tapes released in the USA also cost up to $15. Record companies mixed most popular music singles into monophonic sound until the mid-1960s—then commonly released major recordings in both mono and stereo until the early 1970s. Many Sixties pop albums now available only in stereo were originally released only in mono, and record companies produced the \"stereo\" versions of these albums by simply separating the two tracks of the master tape.\n\nMagnetic tape transformed the recording industry. By the early 1950s, most commercial recordings were mastered on tape instead of recorded directly to disc. Tape facilitated a degree of manipulation in the recording process that was impractical with mixes and multiple generations of directly recorded discs. An early example is Les Paul's 1951 recording of \"How High the Moon\", on which Paul played eight overdubbed guitar tracks. In the 1960s Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys, Frank Zappa, and The Beatles (with producer George Martin) were among the first popular artists to explore the possibilities of multitrack recording techniques and effects on their landmark albums \"Pet Sounds\", \"Freak Out!\", and \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\".\n\nThe compact cassette became a major consumer audio format and advances in electronic and mechanical miniaturization led to the development of the Sony Walkman, a pocket-sized cassette player introduced in 1979. The Walkman was the first personal music player and it gave a major boost to sales of prerecorded cassettes, which became the first widely successful release format that used a re-recordable medium: the vinyl record was a playback-only medium and commercially prerecorded tapes for reel-to-reel tape decks, which many consumers found difficult to operate, were never more than an uncommon niche market item.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1986025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1986025", "title": "Natural religion", "text": "Natural religion\n\nNatural religion most frequently means the \"religion of nature\", in which God, the soul, spirits, and all objects of the supernatural are considered as part of nature and not separate from it. Conversely, it is also used in philosophy, specifically Roman Catholic philosophy, to describe some aspects of religion that are said to be knowable apart from divine revelation through logic and reason alone (see natural theology and Deism), for example, the existence of the unmoved Mover, the first cause of the universe.\n\nMost authors consider natural religion as not only the foundation of monotheistic religions such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam but also distinct from them. According to some authors, aspects of natural religion are found universally among all peoples, often in such forms of shamanism and animism. They are still practiced in many parts of the world. The religions of Native American societies for example are considered as possessing some aspects of natural religion.\n\nNatural religion might have the following meanings:\n\n\nThe basic tenets of natural religion were outlined by Aristotle, whose \"hylomorphism\" considered all things as made of matter and form. The form of all living things is the soul, which guides and directs their development. Many natural religions consider God as the \"soul of the universe\".\n\nEarly monotheism had many naturalistic elements. Heaven and hell were considered physical places above and below the earth. \"Salvation\" was considered resurrection of the body.\n\nIn the fourth century, Christians were concerned that Jesus had not returned and wondered what happened to those who died before the Second Coming of Christ. Christians, led by Augustine of Hippo and under the influence of both gnosticism and neoplatonism, developed a new belief in the soul as capable of a separate existence abstract from the material world. The human souls, unlike those of animals, would survive death and, depending on God's judgment, be transferred to the non-material realms of heaven or hell and the new realm of limbo for unbaptized persons and purgatory for those who do not deserve hell but are not purified for heaven..\n\nAnother distinction from monotheism is found in the Christian belief in miracles, in which God intervenes in history from outside nature. Ancient Roman philosophers and others since objected to this Christian doctrine as God violating his own natural laws. Christians had to separate God more completely from the natural universe in order to show how this could be possible. There were similar neoplatonist tendencies in Judaism and Islam, which also saw God as acting in history.\n\nNatural religions, on the contrary, consider the supernatural as part of the natural universe.\n\nOne of the first attempts to develop a science of religion was \"The Varieties of Religious Experience\" by the American philosopher William James. James saw the basic experience which unified all religions as a sometimes life-changing personal event in which one perceives the connectedness of all things as one unified whole.\n\nJames defined the basics of all religion, including natural religion, when he wrote: \"Were one to characterize the life of religion in the broadest and most general terms possible, one might say that it exists of the belief that there is an unseen order, and that our supreme good lies in harmoniously adjusting ourselves hereto.\"\n\nCertain aspects of natural religion (that is, religious truths that are knowable by human reason alone) are found among different cultures, though not always entirely intact, and to varying degrees, according to philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas and Malebranche.\n\nA few modern scientists such as UK biologist Rupert Sheldrake believe new discoveries coincide with Aristotle's belief in the soul. Forces such as magnetism, gravity, and quantum mechanics also point to non-material forces acting in nature.\n\n"}

It is based on gradation of \"Orients\", i.e. otherness and primitiveness.\n\nAs developed by Milica Bakić-Hayden, Nesting Orientalisms is a conceptual variant of Edward Said's theory of Orientalism; an additional influence is Larry Wolff, but, in fact, she already had used the term ‘Nesting Orientalism’ in the article ‘Orientalist Variations on the Theme “Balkans”: Symbolic Geography in Recent Yugoslav Cultural Politics” (1992), co-author Robert Hayden, before Wolff published \"Inventing Eastern Europe\".\n\nThis concept explains \"a tendency of each region to view the cultures and religions to its South and East as more conservative and primitive\". It explains how a group which creates the Orientalized other can also be the subject of Orientalization by another group, and so on. According to this concept Asia is more \"east\" or \"other\" than Eastern Europe. Within Eastern Europe the Balkans is perceived as most \"eastern\". Such hierarchy continues within the Balkans.\n\nIn the case of the Balkans there are many rankings connected with this concept, which \"play a significant role in . . . identity building [and proclaiming] a more prestigious position within a generally negatively assessed entity\". Proclaiming one's European character was a tool in creating the pattern of \"nesting orientalisms\" in the Balkans.\n\nHence, Bulgarian historian Maria Todorova introduced the related concept of \"nesting balkanisms\". Todorova emphasized the importance of this concept in identity constructions, which in the case of the Balkans involve the dual perception of the Balkans as a part of Europe but also as in opposition, as the \"darker side\" of Europe.\n\nAnother concept related to the concept of nesting orientalisms was introduced by Tanja Petrović, a Serbian anthropologist from Slovenia: that of \"nesting colonialisms\", which is marked by parallels and analogies of the European Union and the rest of the world, which are perceived as former colonial powers and former colonies. This concept provides members of European Union, no matter whether they had a colonial past or not, with a \"pool\" of discursive patterns used for exclusion of those who are outside the European Union.\n\nBulgarian intellectuals have modified the concept of Nesting Orientalisms into the reversed concept of \"Nesting Occidentalisms\".\n\nThe concept of nesting occidentalisms is present in the 2006 mockumentary \"Borat\", which exploits foreign and domestic hierarchies of Americans.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40362512", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40362512", "title": "Political faction", "text": "Political faction\n\nA political faction is a group of individuals within a larger entity, such as a political party, a trade union or other group, or simply a political climate, united by a particular common political purpose that differs in some respect to the rest of the entity. A faction or political party may include fragmented sub-factions, \"parties within a party,\" which may be referred to as power blocs, or voting blocs. Members of factions band together as a way of achieving these goals and advancing their agenda and position within an organisation.\n\nFactions are not limited to political parties; they can and frequently do form within any group that has some sort of political aim or purpose.\n\nThe Latin word \"factio\" denoted originally either of the chariot teams that were organised professionally by private companies in ancient Rome, each recognisable by characteristic colour and arousing supporter hysteria similar to that in modern sports fans. These teams were not unlike gladiator schools, but the lethal nature of that entertainment meant few performers lasted long enough to build up similar crowd loyalty to the \"team\", while the fighters rarely actually teamed up, but rather fought duels or beasts. In time, political currents could become associated with such a team, although precisely how this happened is unclear. In Byzantine Constantinople, two such chariot factions, blue and green, repeatedly made or broke the claims of candidates to the imperial throne.\n\nOccasionally, the term \"faction\" is still used more or less as a synonym for political party, but \"with opprobrious sense, conveying the imputation of selfish or mischievous ends or turbulent or unscrupulous methods\", according to the Oxford English Dictionary. In his Dictionary, Samuel Johnson (a Tory) dismissively defined Whig as \"the name of a faction\". Similarly, in the tenth instalment of The Federalist Papers, James Madison defines a faction as \"a number of citizens, whether amounting to a minority or majority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.\" In plain English this is a group that pursues self-interest at the expense of the greater good.\n\nThe aims of a political faction are as diverse as the different types of bodies within which they appear. Typically, however, they include: advancing a particular policy or policy agenda, preventing the adoption of alternative policies and supporting given individuals to positions of power within the organisation or in the wider political world. A faction can primarily be based around supporting a given person or group, or a single major aim, with little in the way of common agenda otherwise, or it can have a comprehensive and definitive set of policies. Either way, factional politics typically revolve around personality, with a few individuals playing key roles, acting as a magnet for like-minded people, leading the activities of the faction, and acting as a prominent voice for the shared objectives of the faction. Such individuals can be referred to by a variety of names, such as “powerbrokers” or “factional chiefs”.\n\nFactions differ in the amount of organisation and internal structure they possess. On the left, these may take the form of tendencies or platforms. Most factions are very loose organisations, having no definitive list of members, but some factions, have a formal internal structure, with membership lists, regular meetings, official positions – such as negotiators, conveners, whips and organisers, – and a definitive policy position on every issue affecting the broader organisation. Such factions will typically be binding; that is, they rely upon all members casting their votes in accordance with the pre-ordained official stance of the faction.\n\nIn political organisations that are democratic in structure, factions rely heavily on securing enough votes to win important ballots. This process is sometimes referred to as “doing the numbers”. Having the numbers will allow the faction to push policies it supports and elect its members to powerful positions within the broader organisation.\n\nIf one faction develops within an organisation, there will usually be at least one other that develops in opposition to it. Opposing factions will try to match each other's level of organisation and internal discipline, but will also engage in negotiations and trade-offs to ensure that the organisation’s activities are not compromised and that every group has a chance to obtain at least some of its goals.\n\nKey to the operation of an organised faction is the existence of a power base. This will typically be some office, division or branch of the broader organisation over which the faction has effective control. Sometimes a power base may be an external or affiliated organisation that is involved with the broader organisation in some way.\n\nA power base serves several key functions:\n\nThe existence of a factional system can have serious negative consequences for a political organisation. If factional strife becomes intensive and public, the organisation may suffer from perceptions of disunity. Taken one step further, if the conflict is particularly severe, it may cause ruptures within the organisation that seriously impede its effectiveness, leading to break-up or collapse of the organisation.\n\nTo avoid harm to the organisation, factional operations are usually conducted under strong secrecy and with minimal public scrutiny. This, however, can lead to the proliferation of unethical behaviour. Warfare between the factions may lead to tactics such as ballot box-stuffing, stack-outs, membership fraud, and other generally fraudulent conduct. Individuals who abandon a faction may be subject to intense personal vendettas where their former comrades go about sabotaging their careers. A climate of intense factional conflict can also motivate individuals to focus on attacking their factional enemies rather than furthering the broader organisation.\n\nDespite this, the benefits of factional systems are often overlooked. It is often incomprehensible to outsiders why members of a broader organisation would engage in factionalism. This stems from the assumption that the natural factional relationship is one of conflict and strife, when in fact, factions are often able to engage in productive co-operation.\n\nIn any political organisation there are likely to be many highly opinionated and passionate people. The existence of a factional system allows its operations to be more predictable and stable. Compromise and give-and-take between factions allows the organisation to operate without having to satisfy the whims of many different, uncompromising individuals who might otherwise cause a split. So, somewhat counter-intuitively, factionalism can actually promote organisational harmony.\n\nFactions also help to broaden and diversify the organisation’s appeal. A person who might otherwise find the organisation’s goals unattractive might be persuaded to support a faction within it whose goals are closer to their own. Just as a democratic government is often invigorated by a strong opposition, so having a number of distinct points-of-view with an organisation can energise it and allow it to perform its role more effectively. It is also highly unlikely that any sizeable political organisation is wholly united in purpose, so arguably factions simply represent a way of managing pre-existing differences within the organisation.\n\nThe Founding Fathers of the American constitution, explicitly warned against the dangers of party factionalism. Madison, Hamilton, and Washington expressed the belief that factions would create divides that would ultimately dismantle the government. These sentiments can be found in \"The Federalist Papers\", specifically Federalist 10 and 51 written by Madison.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "34611084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34611084", "title": "Save the World (George Harrison song)", "text": "Save the World (George Harrison song)\n\n\"Save the World\" is a song by English musician George Harrison, released as the final track of his 1981 album \"Somewhere in England\". It was also the B-side of \"Teardrops\", which was the second single off the album. An environmental protest song, \"Save the World\" was Harrison's first composition to directly address topical issues such as the nuclear arms race, rainforest and wildlife devastation, and the ecologically irresponsible practices of corporate concerns. Musically, the song partly recalls the style of the comedy troupe Monty Python.\n\nHarrison recorded \"Save the World\" at his Friar Park studio in England in 1980. The recording includes sound effects that support the song's message of a world heading towards self-destruction, including bombs falling, a cash register, a street demonstration, and a nuclear explosion. In 1985, Harrison contributed a version of the song with amended lyrics to Greenpeace's self-titled fundraising album. \"Save the World\" also appeared on the home video \"Greenpeace: Non-Toxic Video Hits\".\n\nSince its release, the song has been held in low regard by several music critics and biographers. Some of these reviewers highlight the disparity between the serious message and the quirky musical backing. In line with Harrison's wishes, a demo of \"Save the World\" appeared as the sole bonus track on the posthumously reissued \"Somewhere in England\" in 2004.\n\nAs reproduced in the 2017 book \"I, Me, Mine – The Extended Edition\", George Harrison dated the lyrics of \"Save the World\" to 24 February 1978, with Hana, Maui as the location. During that visit to Hawaii, Harrison completed the writing for his 1979 album \"George Harrison\", which, as with its predecessor, \"Thirty Three & 1/3\", reflected a light-heartedness that had been lacking in much of his work. He returned to the song when working on his album \"Somewhere in England\", most of which was written between mid 1979 and the early part of 1980. As with a track Harrison wrote for \"Somewhere in England\", \"Tears of the World\", \"Save the World\" conveys his disapproval at the ecological issues and political machinations threatening the world in the early 1980s.\n\nDuring 1980, Harrison became a member of Greenpeace and CND; he also protested against the use of nuclear energy with Friends of the Earth, in London, and helped finance \"Vole\", a green magazine launched by Monty Python member Terry Jones. Author Simon Leng describes \"Save the World\" as Harrison's first attempt at ecology-focused songwriting and a \"quirky protest song\" that marked \"the culmination of the Pythonization of Harrison's music\" at a time when he was increasingly associated with members of the Monty Python comedy troupe through his film company HandMade Films. While recognising \"Save the World\" as indicative of its composer's disillusion with the 1980s, Leng comments that Harrison had long valued the \"madness\" of Monty Python's comedy as \"a mirror to the insanity of world events\", and that his adoption of humour was a \"peculiarly British\" reaction to a grave situation.\n\nIn his lyrics, Harrison sings of \"This planet's rape, how we've abused it\". He first addresses the nuclear arms race being waged between the United States and the Soviet Union, and laments the introduction of intergalactic weapons. He then addresses the devastation of the world's rainforests for commercial gain and the threat to wildlife. He refers to the Save the Whales environmental campaign and how Greenpeace's attempts to limit whale hunting had been thwarted by the interests of \"dog food salesmen\". He also laments the irresponsibility of arms manufacturers and, with regard to plutonium stockpiles, concludes: \"Now you can make your own H-bomb / Right in the kitchen with your mom.\" He then denigrates the use of nuclear power as a \"half-wit's answer to a need\" that causes cancer. In the final verse, Harrison attributes the world's environmental problems to just a few profit-seeking individuals. He ends on what he promises to be \"a happy note\" by stating that a simple solution lies in the realisation that \"God [lives] in your heart\".\n\nIn a 1987 interview, Harrison said that \"Save the World\" was meant to be \"serious and funny at the same time\". Contrasting with the subject matter, the music recalls the comedy songs of Monty Python. In the description of Harrison biographer Alan Clayson, the style is \"quasi-reggae\", while author Ian Inglis refers to it being sung on the official recording \"in a deceptively sweet voice to a march tempo\". Leng also likens the song's musical aspects to Harrison's 1975 tribute to comedian Legs Larry Smith, \"His Name Is Legs (Ladies and Gentlemen)\", in terms of its groove and musical arrangement.\n\nHarrison recorded \"Save the World\" during the main sessions for \"Somewhere in England\", held at his FPSHOT studio in Henley, Oxfordshire, between March and September 1980. Aside from Harrison, who played guitars and self-produced the sessions, the musicians on the track were Neil Larsen and Gary Brooker (both on keyboards), Willie Weeks (bass), Jim Keltner (drums), Ray Cooper (percussion) and Tom Scott (horns). Harrison added various sound effects throughout the recording, including the sound of bombs being dropped, a cash register, an army on the march, gunfire, and a street demonstration. The majority of these effects appear midway through the song, accompanied by a Moog synthesizer solo, after which the section concludes with the sound of a nuclear explosion. A baby's cry then accompanies the song's return.\n\nAt the end of the track, Harrison edited in the faint sound of a bow-played Indian string instrument, the tar shehnai. This part was taken from \"Crying\", an instrumental piece performed by Vinayak Vora and released on Harrison's 1968 soundtrack album \"Wonderwall Music\". When asked about its inclusion in \"Save the World\", Harrison told \"Musician\" magazine in 1987: \"I just wanted to let the whole song go out with something sad, to touch that nerve and maybe make you think, 'Ohhh shit.'\"\n\nAfter submitting \"Somewhere in England\" to Warner Bros. Records, the distributor of his Dark Horse record label, in late September 1980, Harrison was forced to rework the content of the album – including replacing four of the original songs – to ensure the release had more commercial appeal. Harrison chose to retain \"Save the World\" in the revised track listing and worked with Ray Cooper on a second version of the album. Although the mix for the re-submitted \"Save the World\" differed little from Harrison's original, Cooper was credited as a co-producer.\n\n\"Somewhere in England\" was released on 1 June 1981, with \"Save the World\" sequenced as the final track. It was the only song from Harrison's initial submission to Warner Bros. to retain its position in the running order of the official release. The album was a relative commercial success, an outcome that was due largely to a public outpouring of grief in reaction to the murder of Harrison's former Beatles bandmate John Lennon in December 1980. As a follow-up single to Harrison's tribute to Lennon, \"All Those Years Ago\", Warner's released \"Teardrops\", which was another of the album's four replacement tracks. This release took place on 20 July 1981, with \"Save the World\" appearing as the single's B-side.\n\nIn his album review for \"Creem\" magazine, Mitchell Cohen called Harrison a \"C– thinker\" and ridiculed the lyrics of \"Save the World\" with the comment: \"Harrison comes out against \"paper towels\" (!!) (expect a rebuttal on the next Nancy Walker album) and whalemeat used as dogfood (ditto Lorne Greene).\" In another unfavourable review, Harry Thomas of \"Rolling Stone\" opined that \"Social commentary and ironic wit clearly remain outside the scope of Harrison's very real talents\" and wrote of \"Save the World\": \"Veering uncertainly between whimsy and dour warnings, the song ultimately fails either to galvanize or amuse.\" Conversely, \"NME\" critic Bob Woffinden welcomed the song as an example of how the album's subject matter ranged beyond the \"humdrum\", and he found it \"only characteristic of [Harrison] to embrace more universal themes\".\n\nHarrison revisited \"Save the World\" in 1985 when Greenpeace UK approached him for a contribution to an album intended to raise funds for their environmental efforts. Harrison amended the lyrics slightly to include further references to Greenpeace, along with a spoken comment that conveyed his disgust with the power of corporations: \"You greedy bastards\". In addition to recording a new vocal, he remixed the musical backing, giving more prominence to some of the guitar parts.\nTitled \"Greenpeace – The Album\", and including contributions from fifteen other British artists, the album was released in the UK by EMI on 4 June 1985. The inclusion of \"Save the World\" on \"Greenpeace\" marked a rare new musical release for Harrison between 1983 and 1986, when he was otherwise engaged in film production with the continued success of HandMade. Over the same period, however, he became increasingly involved in environmental matters; these activities included attending an anti-nuclear demonstration in London's Trafalgar Square, voicing support for the British Green Party, and inspiring a successful campaign to stop the John Lewis Partnership from demolishing Henley's Regal Cinema and building a supermarket complex.\n\nThe song was also included in the video compilation \"Greenpeace: Non-Toxic Video Hits\", released in December 1985, five months after the French intelligence services' sinking of the Greenpeace flagship \"Rainbow Warrior\". Produced by Ian Weiner, the clip for \"Save the World\" consisted of scenes of \"Rainbow Warrior\" and Greenpeace personnel at work on their international activist campaigns.\n\nUntil his death in November 2001, Harrison continued to express alarm at the ecological issues facing the world. He dedicated his 1989 compilation album \"Best of Dark Horse\" to Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and \"anyone interested in saving our planet\"; in the revised artwork for the 2001 reissue of \"All Things Must Pass\", he included a series of images showing the gradual encroachment of pollution and industry onto the Friar Park scene depicted on that album's 1970 cover photo. As a songwriter, he revisited the themes of \"Save the World\" in \"Cockamamie Business\", a new song issued on \"Best of Dark Horse\", and in the title track to his final studio album, the posthumously released \"Brainwashed\".\n\nIn the 1990s, Harrison's elder sister, Louise, used \"Save the World\" as the soundtrack for a series of public service radio segments she produced, titled \"Good Earthkeeping Tips\", which offered information on environmental issues. In keeping with Harrison's instructions for the reissuing of his Dark Horse catalogue, a demo of the song appeared as the sole bonus track on the 2004 reissue of \"Somewhere in England\".<ref name=\"John Metzger/MB\">John Metzger, \"George Harrison \"The Dark Horse Years\" (Part Three: \"Somewhere in England\")\", \"The Music Box\", vol. 11 (5), May 2004 (retrieved 20 November 2016).</ref> Writing for \"Uncut\" in March 2017, Neil Spencer highlighted \"Save the World\" as one of the \"[unexpected] delights\" among Harrison's 1980s releases, and said that while it was dismissed as \"soft protest\" originally, the song is \"beautifully played and never more relevant than today\".<ref name=\"Spencer/Uncut\">Neil Spencer, \"George Harrison – The Vinyl Collection\", uncut.co.uk, 27 March 2017 (retrieved 30 November 2017).</ref>\n\n\"Save the World\" is held in low regard by several Harrison and Beatles biographers. Chip Madinger and Mark Easter describe it as \"a wholly unappealing track\" on which the \"heavyhandedness\" of the lyrics is completely at odds with the musical mood. Ian Inglis echoes this view, deeming the lyrics \"trite to the point of being risible\" and the combination of an unfocused narrative and the overuse of sound effects to be as unsuccessful as the Beatles' work during the \"Magical Mystery Tour\" era. Although he concedes that the scarcity of environmental songs in the early 1980s, relative to the 1990s, might be a mitigating factor, Inglis dismisses the song as a \"hopelessly vague indictment of the perils we are inflicting around the globe\", adding: \"The problem with such a general attack is that it lacks focus and, therefore, force.\"\n\nAlan Clayson views Harrison's conservationist sentiments as \"laudable\" and considers the track to be a protest song in the mould of Barry McGuire's 1965 hit \"Eve of Destruction\", yet he also identifies the lack of subtlety as betraying \"the impartiality of one long and, perhaps, guiltily isolated from the everyday\". Dale Allison recognises it as \"the most extensive expression of George's ecological anxiety\" and a sincere statement, particularly as Harrison chose to revisit the track for the Greenpeace album. However, Allison deems it to be a \"strange song\" with a \"jarring disjunction between lyric and sound\", and he says that as with Harrison's other songs about pollution and environmental issues, his message reflects a romanticism that was born out of 1960s radicalism but fails to convince in the manner of Neil Young's \"After the Gold Rush\". Simon Leng finds \"Save the World\" closer in style to Monty Python's \"Eric the Half-a-Bee\" than to a genuine environmental song such as \"Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)\" by Marvin Gaye. He describes the \"Somewhere in England\" version as \"horribly overproduced\" next to the \"charming\" demo, which \"is more Dylan than Monty Python\".\n\nAccording to Simon Leng:\n\n\n"}

Their worldviews were formed by years of Stalin's repressions and purges, which affected many of the Sixtiers' immediate families; and World War II, where many of them had volunteered to fight.\n\nSixtiers were distinguished by their liberal and anti-totalitarian views, and romanticism that found vivid expressions in music and visual arts. Although most of the Sixtiers believed in Communist ideals, they had come to be strongly disappointed with Stalin's regime and its repression of basic civil liberties.\n\nMany of the Sixtiers were intellectuals of roughly two strains: the \"physicists\" (those involved in the technical sciences) and the \"lyricists\" (writers, theater and film professionals, and otherwise liberal arts representatives). Bard (singer-songwriter) culture, poetry, disillusionment in politics, and love for camping trips to the farther regions of the Soviet Union were some of the common attributes and pastimes of the Sixtiers.\n\nThe Sixtiers had some parallels to the New Left and hippie movements in the West but had more in common with the more intellectual-oriented Beat Generation.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "42128031", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42128031", "title": "Super Mario Bros.", "text": "Super Mario Bros.\n\nSuper Mario Bros. is a platform video game developed and published by Nintendo. The successor to the 1983 arcade game, \"Mario Bros.\", it was released in Japan in 1985 for the Famicom, and in North America and Europe for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1985 and 1987 respectively. Players control Mario, or his brother Luigi in the multiplayer mode, as they travel the Mushroom Kingdom to rescue Princess Toadstool from the antagonist, Bowser. They must traverse side-scrolling stages while avoiding hazards such as enemies and pits with the aid of power-ups such as the Super Mushroom, Fire Flower and Starman.\n\nThe game was designed by Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka and was initially planned as a farewell salute to cartridge games on the Famicom, in anticipation of the forthcoming release of the Famicom Disk System, drawing technical influence from several of the console's previous games. It was designed with ease of access in mind, with the first level, World 1-1, designed to introduce the core mechanics. The music was composed by Koji Kondo, and is considered influential in making music a larger aspect of video games.\n\n\"Super Mario Bros.\" is frequently cited as one of the greatest video games of all time, with praise going towards its precise controls. It has sold over 40 million physical copies, also making it one of the bestselling games of all time. It is credited alongside the NES as one of the key factors in reviving the video game industry after the 1983 crash, and helped popularize side-scrolling platform games. It began an expansive franchise including a long-running game series, an animated television series, and a feature film. Ports and remakes of the game have been released for most of Nintendo's future systems. Alongside Mario himself, \"Super Mario Bros.\" has become a prominent aspect of popular culture.\n\nIn \"Super Mario Bros.\", the player takes on the role of Mario, the protagonist of the series. Mario's younger brother, Luigi, is controlled by the second player in the game's multiplayer mode and assumes the same plot role and functionality as Mario. The objective is to race through the Mushroom Kingdom, survive the main antagonist Bowser's forces, and save Princess Toadstool. The game is a side-scrolling platformer; the player moves from the left side of the screen to the right side in order to reach the flag pole at the end of each level.\n\nThe game world features coins scattered around for Mario to collect and special bricks marked with a question mark (\"?\"), which when hit from below by Mario may reveal more coins or a special item. Other \"secret\", often invisible, bricks may contain more coins or rare items. If the player gains a Super Mushroom, Mario grows to double his size and gains the ability to break bricks above him. If Mario gets hit in this mode, then instead of dying he turns back to regular Mario. Players start with a certain number of lives and may gain additional lives by picking up green spotted orange 1-Up mushrooms hidden in bricks, or by collecting 100 coins, defeating several enemies in a row with a Koopa shell, or bouncing on enemies successively without touching the ground. Mario loses a life if he takes damage while small, falls in a bottomless pit, or runs out of time. The game ends when all lives are lost, although a button input can be used on the game over screen to continue from the first level of the world in which the player died.\n\nMario's primary attack is jumping on top of enemies, though many enemies have differing responses to this. For example, a Goomba will flatten and be defeated, while a Koopa Troopa will temporarily retract into its shell, allowing Mario to use it as a projectile. These shells may be deflected off a wall to destroy other enemies, though they can also bounce back against Mario, which will hurt or kill him. Other enemies, such as underwater foes and enemies with spiked tops, cannot be jumped on and damage the player instead. Mario can also defeat enemies above him by jumping to hit the brick that the enemy is standing on. Mario may also acquire the Fire Flower from certain ? blocks that when picked up changes the color of Super Mario's outfit and allows him to throw fireballs. A less common item is the Starman, which often appears when Mario hits certain concealed or otherwise invisible blocks. This item makes Mario temporarily invincible to most hazards and capable of defeating enemies on contact.\n\nThe game consists of eight worlds with four sub-levels called \"stages\" in each world.\" The final stage of each world takes place in a castle where Bowser is fought above a suspension bridge; the first seven of these Bowsers are \"false Bowsers\" whom are actually minions disguised as him, whilst the real Bowser is found in the 8th world. Bowser and his decoys are defeated by jumping over them and reaching the axe on the end of the bridge, although they can also be defeated using a Fire Flower. The game also includes some stages taking place underwater, which contain different enemies. In addition, there are bonuses and secret areas in the game. Most secret areas contain more coins for Mario to collect, but some contain \"warp pipes\" that allow Mario to advance directly to later worlds in the game without completing the intervening stages. After completing the game once, the player is rewarded with the ability to replay the game with changes made to increase its difficulty, such as all Goombas in the game being replaced with Buzzy Beetles, enemies similar to Koopa Troopas who cannot be defeated using the Fire Flower.\n\nIn the fantasy setting of the Mushroom Kingdom, a tribe of turtle-like creatures known as the Koopa Troopas invade the kingdom and uses the magic of its king, Bowser, to turn its inhabitants, known as the Mushroom People, into inanimate objects such as bricks, stones and horsehair plants. Bowser and his army also kidnap Princess Toadstool, the princess of the Mushroom Kingdom and the only one with the ability to reverse Bowser's spell. After hearing the news, Mario sets out to save the princess and free the kingdom from Bowser. After traveling through various parts of the kingdom and fighting Bowser's forces along the way, Mario reaches Bowser's final stronghold, where he is able to defeat him by striking an axe on the bridge suspended over lava he is standing on, breaking the bridge, defeating Bowser, and allowing for the princess to be freed and saving the Mushroom Kingdom.\n\n\"Super Mario Bros.\", the successor to the 1983 arcade title \"Mario Bros.\", was designed by Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka, both of whom belonged to Nintendo's Creative Department, and largely programmed by Toshihiki Nakago of SRD Company, Ltd. Though not originally using any particular character, the very deliberate creative process of what would become their next game was motivated by their technical knowledge from previous games such as \"Excitebike\", \"Devil World\" and \"Kung Fu\", by a desire to give the ROM cartridge format \"a final exclamation point\" in light of the forthcoming Famicom Disk System which was expected to become the dominant new game delivery medium, and by continuing their legacy of \"athletic games\" with a character running and jumping with many obstacles. Miyamoto explained, \"We felt strongly about how we were the first to come up with that genre, and it was a goal of ours to keep pushing it.\" The game was made in tandem with \"The Legend of Zelda\", another Famicom game directed and designed by Miyamoto, which released in Japan five months after \"Super Mario Bros.\" As a result, certain elements were carried over from \"The Legend of Zelda\" to \"Super Mario Bros\"; for instance, the fire bars that appear in the game’s castle levels began as an unused object from \"Zelda\". Development was aimed at simplicity in order to have a new game available for the end-of-year shopping season.\n\nThe developers started by putting together a prototype in which the player simply moved a 16 by 32 pixel square around a single screen. Tezuka suggested the use of Mario after seeing the sales figures of \"Mario Bros.\", which was still selling well throughout the previous year. The team chose to name the game \"Super Mario Bros.\" after deciding to implement the Super Mushroom into the game. The game initially made use of a concept in which Mario or Luigi could enter a rocket ship and drive it around while firing at enemies, but this went unused; the final game's sky-based bonus stages are a remnant of this concept. After releasing \"Mario Bros.\", the team had reflected that it had been an illogical gameplay decision for Mario to be hurt by stomping upon the walking turtles, so they decided that any future \"Mario\" game would \"definitely have it so that you could jump on turtles all you want.\" When designing King Koopa, Miyamoto initially imagined the character as an ox, taking inspiration from the character design of the Ox King the Toei Animation film \"Alakazam the Great\". However, when Tezuka saw Miyamoto’s design for the character, he noted that it looked more akin to that of a turtle, prompting the two to work on defining and fleshing out the character’s design until coming up with his final appearance.\n\nThe development of \"Super Mario Bros.\" is an early example of specialization in the video game industry, made possible and necessary by the capabilities of the Famicom. Miyamoto designed the game world and led a team of seven programmers and artists who turned his ideas into code, sprites, music and sound effects.\n\nThe team based the level design around a small Mario, intending to later make his size bigger in the final version. Then they decided it would be fun to let Mario change his size via a power-up. The early level design was focused on teaching players that mushrooms were distinct from Goombas and would be beneficial to them, so in the first level of the game, the first mushroom is difficult to avoid if it is released. The use of mushrooms to change size was influenced by common Japanese folktales in which people wander into forests and eat magical mushrooms; this also resulted in the game world being named the \"Mushroom Kingdom\". The team also deliberately chose not to have Mario begin levels as Super Mario in order to make obtaining a mushroom more gratifying for the player. Miyamoto explained: \"When we made the prototype of the big Mario, we did not feel he was big enough. So, we came up with the idea of showing the smaller Mario first, who could be made bigger later in the game; then players could see and feel that he was bigger.\" A rumor stemming from a Japanese magazine claimed that the developers came up with the idea to include a small Mario after a bug in the game caused only the upper-half of his body to appear, but this claim has been disavowed by Miyamoto. Miyamoto said the shell-kicking 1-up trick was intentionally designed and carefully tested, but \"people turned out to be a lot better at pulling the trick off for ages on end than we thought\". Other features, such as blocks containing multiple coins, were inspired by programming glitches.\n\n\"Super Mario Bros.\" was developed via a 256-kilobit cartridge. Due to technical limitations at the time, several tactics were used to save cartridge space. For instance, clouds and bushes in the game’s backgrounds use that same sprite recolored. Sound effects were also recycled; the sound that plays when Mario is damaged is recycled and used as the sound effect for when he enters a pipe, as applies similarly to Mario jumping on an enemy and swimming in an underwater level. After completing the game, the development team decided that they should introduce players with a simple, easy-to-defeat enemy rather than beginning the game with Koopa Troopas. By this point, the game had nearly run out of memory, so the designers created the Goombas by making a single static image and flipping it back and forth to save space while creating a convincing character animation. After the addition of the game’s music, around 20 bytes of open cartridge space were left. Miyamoto used this remaining space to add a sprite of a crown into the game, which would appear in the player’s life counter if they managed to obtain at least 10 lives.\n\nDuring the third generation of video game consoles, tutorials which explained the mechanics of the game were rare. Instead, players learned how a video game worked through being guided by level design. The opening section of \"Super Mario Bros.\" was therefore specifically designed in such a way that players would be forced to explore the mechanics of the game in order to be able to advance. Rather than confront the newly oriented player with obstacles, the first level of \"Super Mario Bros.\" lays down the variety of in-game hazards by means of repetition, iteration, and escalation. In an interview with \"Eurogamer\", Miyamoto explained that he created \"World 1-1\" to contain everything a player needs to \"gradually and naturally understand what they're doing\", so that they can quickly understand how the game works. According to Miyamoto, once the player understands the mechanics of the game, the player will be able to play more freely and it becomes \"their game.\"\n\nThe \"Minus World\" (also referred to as \"World Negative One\") is the name given to an unbeatable glitch level present in the original release of \"Super Mario Bros.\" World 1-2 contains a hidden warp zone, with warp pipes that transport the player to worlds 2, 3, and 4, accessed by running over a wall near the exit. If the player is able to exploit a bug that allows Mario to pass through bricks, the player can enter the warp zone by passing through the wall and the pipe to World 2-1 and 4-1 may instead transport the player to a stage labeled \"World -1\". This stage's map is identical to worlds 2-2 and 7-2, and upon entering the warp pipe at the end, the player is taken back to the start of the level, thus trapping the player in the level until all lives have been lost. Although the level name is shown as \" -1\" with a leading space on the heads-up display, it is actually World 36-1, with the tile for 36 being shown as a blank space.\n\nThe Minus World bug in the Japanese Famicom Disk System version of the game behaves differently and creates multiple, completable stages. \"World -1\" is an underwater version of World 1-3 with an underwater level color palette and underwater level music, and contains sprites of Princess Toadstool, Bowser, and Hammer Bros. \"World -2\" is an identical copy of World 7-3, and \"World -3\" is a copy of World 4-4 with an underground level colour palette and underground level music, and does not loop if the player takes the wrong path, contrary to the original World 4-4. After completing the level, Toad's usual message is displayed, but Toad himself is absent. After completing these levels, the player returns to the title screen as if the game were completed, and can now replay the game in \"Hard Mode.\" There are actually hundreds of glitch levels beyond the Minus World (256 worlds are present including the 8 playable ones), which can be accessed in a multitude of ways, such as cheat codes or ROM hacking.\n\nNintendo sound designer Koji Kondo wrote the six-song musical score for \"Super Mario Bros.\", as well as designing all of the game's sound effects. At the time he was composing, video game music was mostly meant to attract attention, not necessarily to enhance or conform to the game. Kondo's work on \"Super Mario Bros.\" was one of the major forces in the shift towards music becoming an integral and participatory part of video games. Kondo had two specific goals for his music: \"to convey an unambiguous sonic image of the game world\", and \"to enhance the emotional and physical experience of the gamer\".\n\nThe music of \"Super Mario Bros.\" is coordinated with the onscreen animations of the various sprites, which was one way which Kondo created a sense of greater immersion. Kondo wasn't the first to do this in a video game; for instance, \"Space Invaders\" features a simple song that gets faster and faster as the aliens speed up, eliciting a sense of stress and impending doom which matches the increasing challenge of the game. However, Kondo attempted to take the idea further, stating that the primary question determining the use of a game's music was \"Do the game and music fit one another?\" Unlike most games at the time, for which composers were hired later in the process to add music to a nearly finished game, Kondo was a part of the development team almost from the beginning of production, working in tandem with the rest of the team to create the game's soundtrack. Kondo's compositions were largely influenced by the game's gameplay, intending for it to \"heighten the feeling of how the game controls\".\n\nBefore composition began, a prototype of the game was presented to Kondo so that he could get an idea of Mario's general environment and revolve the music around it. Kondo wrote the score with the help of a small piano to create appropriate melodies to fit the game's environments. After the development of the game showed progress, Kondo began to feel that his music did not quite fit the pace of the game, so he changed it a bit by increasing the songs' tempos. The music was further adjusted based on the expectations of Nintendo's play-testers.\n\n\"Super Mario Bros.\" was first released in Japan on September 13, 1985, for the Famicom. It was later rereleased there for the Famicom Disk System, Nintendo's proprietary floppy disk drive for the Famicom. The game was released in North America later that year for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Alongside the game's separate release, the game was also released in 1988 along with the shooting range game \"Duck Hunt\" as part of a single ROM cartridge which came packaged with the NES as a pack-in title. This version of the game is extremely common in North America, with millions of copies of it having been manufactured and sold in the United States. Another cartridge, touting the two games as well as \"World Class Track Meet\", was also manufactured.\n\nThe game's concrete North American release date is unknown and is frequently debated; despite generally being cited as having been released alongside the NES in October 1985 as a launch title, several other sources conflict with this statement, suggesting that the game may have released in other varying time frames ranging from November 1985 to early 1986.\n\nAs one of Nintendo's most popular games, \"Super Mario Bros.\" has been re-released and remade numerous times, with every single major Nintendo console up to the Wii U sporting its own port or remake of the game with the exception of the Nintendo 64.\n\n\"Super Mario Bros.\" has been ported several times since its release. A version of the game titled Super Mario Bros. Special developed by Hudson Soft was released in Japan in 1986 for the NEC PC-8801 and Sharp X1 personal computers. Despite featuring similar controls and graphics, the game has different level designs and new items, as well as brand new enemies based on enemies from \"Mario Bros.\" and \"Donkey Kong\". A handheld LCD game under the same name was released as a part of Nintendo's Game & Watch line of LCD games.\n\nVs. Super Mario Bros. is an arcade adaptation of the original version of \"Super Mario Bros\", released through Nintendo's NES-based arcade cabinet, the Nintendo Vs. Unisystem (and its variant, Nintendo Vs. Dualsystem). Several of the game's levels are changed, containing narrower platforms, more dangerous enemies, and omitting several hidden secrets such as 1-ups, making the game more difficult than the original \"Super Mario Bros.\" Entirely new stages are also present, several of which went on to be featured in the game's Japanese sequel, \"\" The game was featured in an official contest during the 1986 ACME convention in Chicago.\n\nAn emulated version of the title was released for the Nintendo Switch via the Arcade Archives collection on December 22, 2017. Chris Kohler of Kotaku called the game \"The meanest trick Nintendo ever played\", referring to the several level changes as differences which made it difficult for people who had mastered the NES game.\n\nA remade version of \"Super Mario Bros.\" was included as a part of \"Super Mario All-Stars\", a compilation game released in 1993 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, alongside remakes of several of the other \"Super Mario\" games released for the NES. The version of \"Super Mario Bros.\" included in this compilation has improved graphics and sound to match the SNES's 16-bit capabilities, as well as minor alterations to some of the game's collision mechanics. The game also features the ability for a player to save their progress midway through the game and changes the game's multiplayer mode so that the two players switch off after every level in addition to whenever a player dies. \"Super Mario All-Stars\" was also rereleased for the Wii as a re-packaged, 25th anniversary version, featuring the same version of the game, along with a 32-page art book and a compilation CD of music from various \"Super Mario\" games.\n\nSuper Mario Bros. Deluxe, sometimes referred to as Super Mario Bros. DX, was released on the Game Boy Color in 1999 in North America and Europe and in 2000 in Japan. Based on the original \"Super Mario Bros.\", it features an overworld level map, simultaneous multiplayer, a Challenge mode in which the player finds hidden objects and achieves a certain score in addition to normally completing the level, and eight additional worlds based on the main worlds of the Japanese 1986 game \"\". It is compatible with the Game Boy Printer. Compared to \"Super Mario Bros.\", the game features a few minor visual upgrades such as water and lava now being animated rather than static, and a smaller screen due to the lower resolution of the Game Boy Color.\n\nIt was released on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console in 2014. In Japan, users who registered a Nintendo Network ID on their Nintendo 3DS system between December 10, 2013 and January 10, 2014 received a free download code, with emails with download codes being sent out starting January 27, 2014. In Europe and Australia, users who registered a Nintendo Network ID on their Nintendo 3DS system between December 10, 2013 and January 31, 2014 received a free download code, with emails with download codes being sent out from February 13 to 28, 2014. It was released for purchase on the Nintendo 3DS eShop in Europe on February 27, 2014, in Australia on February 28, 2014, and in North America on December 25, 2014.\n\nIn early 2003, \"Super Mario Bros.\" was ported to the Game Boy Advance as a part of the Famicom Minis collection in Japan and as a part of the NES Series in the US. This version of the game is entirely emulated, making it completely identical to the original game. According to the NPD Group (which tracks game sales in North America), this re-released version of \"Super Mario Bros.\" was the best-selling Game Boy Advance game from June 2004 to December 2004. In 2005, Nintendo re-released this port of the game as a part of the game's 20th Anniversary; this special edition of the game went on to sell approximately 876,000 units.\n\nThe game is one of the 19 unlockable NES games included in the GameCube game \"Animal Crossing\", for which it was distributed by Famitsu as a prize for owners of Dobutsu no Mori+; outside of this, the game can't be unlocked through in-game conventional means, and the only way to access it is through the use of a third-party cheat device such as a Game Shark or Action Replay.\n\n\"Super Mario Bros.\" is featured as one of the 30 included games with the NES Classic Edition, a dedicated video game console containing several NES games. This version of the game allows for the use of suspension points to save in-game progress, and can be played in various different display styles, including its original 4:3 resolution, a \"pixel-perfect\" resolution and a style emulating the look of a cathode ray tube television.\n\n\"Super Mario Bros.\" has been re-released for several of Nintendo's game systems as a part of their Virtual Console line of classic video game releases. It was first released for the Wii on December 2, 2006 in Japan, December 25, 2006 in North America and January 5, 2007 in PAL regions. The release is a complete emulation of the original game, meaning that nothing is changed from the its original NES release. This version of the game is also one of the \"trial games\" made available in the \"Masterpieces\" section in \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\", where it can be demoed for a limited amount of time.\nA Nintendo 3DS release of the game was initially distributed exclusively to members of Nintendo's 3DS Ambassador Program in September 2011. A general release of the title later came through in Japan on January 5, 2012, in North America on February 16, 2012 and in Europe on March 1, 2012. The game was released for the Wii U's Virtual Console in Japan on June 5, 2013, followed by Europe on September 12, 2013 and North America on September 19, 2013.\n\nSeveral modified variants of the game have been released, many of which are ROM hacks of the original NES game. A promotional, graphically-modified version of the game titled All Night Nippon Super Mario Bros. was officially released only in Japan in December 1986 for the Famicom Disk System as a promotional item given away by the popular Japanese radio show \"All Night Nippon\" and published by Fuji TV, the same company which later went on to publish \"Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic\" (which was released outside of Japan as \"Super Mario Bros. 2\"). (and in turn is extremely rare). The game features graphics based upon the show, with sprites of the enemies, mushroom retainers, and other characters being changed to look like famous Japanese music idols, recording artists, and DJs as well as other people related to \"All-Night Nippon\". The game also makes use of the same slightly upgraded graphics and alternate physics featured in \"Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels\". This version of the game is considered extremely rare, with copies going online for upwards of nearly $500. On November 11, 2010, a special red variant of the Wii containing a pre-downloaded version of the game was released in Japan to celebrate \"Super Mario Bros\".'s 25th anniversary. This version of the game features several graphical changes, such as \"?\" blocks instead having the number \"25\" on them to symbolize the game's anniversary.\n\nSuper Luigi Bros., a redux of the game featuring Luigi, was included as a feature within \"NES Remix 2\", based on a mission featured in the first \"NES Remix\" featuring Luigi in a backwards version of World 1-2. The player now controls Luigi instead of Mario, who now jumps higher and slides more when running on the ground similar to his appearance in the Japanese \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" (if the game's two-player mode is selected, both players control as Luigi), and the game's level designs are exactly the same as they are in the original \"Super Mario Bros\" but completely mirrored (i.e. the game scrolls from left-to-right rather than vice versa).\n\n\"Super Mario Bros.\" was immensely successful and helped popularize side-scrolling platform games. Altogether, excluding ports and rereleases, the original NES version of the game has sold 40.24 million copies, making it the bestselling video game in the \"Mario\" series and one of the bestselling video games of all time, with 29 million copies sold in North America. The game was the all-time bestselling game for over 20 years until its lifetime sales were ultimately surpassed by \"Wii Sports\". The game's Wii Virtual Console release was also successful, becoming the #1 selling game out of the service's line-up of games by mid-2007.\n\nVideo game magazine \"Computer Entertainer / Video Game Update\" highly praised \"Super Mario Bros.\", writing that the game was worthy of \"a spot in the hall of fame reserved for truly addictive action games\", praising its \"cute and comical\" graphics and its lively music. It stated that the title was a must-have for the system, and considered its greatest strength to be its depth of play.\n\nRetrospective critical analysis of the game has been extremely positive, with many touting it as one of the best video games of all-time. \"Nintendo Power\" listed it as the fourth best Nintendo Entertainment System video game, describing it as the game that started the modern era of video games as well as \"Shigeru Miyamoto's masterpiece\". The game ranked first on \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" \"Greatest 200 Games of Their Time\" list and was named in \"IGN\" top 100 games of all-time list twice (in 2005 and 2007). In 2009, \"Game Informer\" put \"Super Mario Bros.\" in second place on their list of \"The Top 200 Games of All Time,\" behind \"The Legend of Zelda\", saying that it \"remains a monument to brilliant design and fun gameplay\". The \"Game Informer\" staff also ranked it the second best in their 2001 list of the top 100 games ever made. In 2012, \"G4\" ranked \"Super Mario Bros.\" first of the \"Top 100 Video Games of All Time\", citing its revolutionary gameplay as well as its role in helping recover the NA gaming industry from the Video Game Crash of 1983. In 2014, \"IGN\" ranked \"Super Mario Bros.\" as the best Nintendo game in their \"Top 125 Nintendo Games of All Time\" list, saying that \"this is the most important Nintendo game ever made\". In a poll held by IGN in 2005, the game was ranked number one in the website's list of the 100 greatest video games of all-time. In 2017, Polygon ranked the game #8 out of the core \"Super Mario\" games, crediting the game with \"kick[ing] off this franchise's habit of being an exception to so many rules\". In 2018, Business Insider included the game as number 2 in their list of the top 10 \"Super Mario\" games.\n\nSeveral critics have praised the game for its precise controls, which allow the player to control how high and far Mario or Luigi jumps, and how fast he runs. \"AllGame\" gave \"Super Mario Bros.\" a five-star rating, stating that \"[T]he sense of excitement, wonder and – most of all – enjoyment felt upon first playing this masterpiece of videogame can't barely be put into words. And while its sequels have far surpassed it in terms of length, graphics, sound and other aspects, \"Super Mario Bros.\", like any classic – whether of a cinematic or musical nature – has withstood the test of time, continuing to be fun and playable\" and that any gamer \"needs to play this game at least once, if not simply for a history lesson\". Reviewing the Virtual Console Release of the game, \"IGN\" called it \"an absolute must for any gamer's Virtual Console collection.\" Darren Calvert of Nintendo Life called the game's visuals \"unavoidably outdated\" compared to newer games, but mused that they were impressive at the time that the game was released.\n\nThe Game Boy Advance port of \"Super Mario Bros.\" holds an aggregate score of 84 on Metacritic. Many critics compared the port to previous ports of the game such as \"Super Mario Deluxe\" and \"Super Mario All-Stars\", noting its comparative lack of brand new content to separate it from the original version of the game. Jeremy Parish of \"1up.com\" called the game \"The most fun you'll ever have while being robbed blind,\" ultimately giving the game a score of 80% and praising its larger-scaling screen compared to \"Deluxe\" while greatly criticizing its lack of new features. \"IGN\" Craig Harris labeled the game as a \"must-have,\" but also mused \"just don't expect much more than the original NES game repackaged on a tiny GBA cart.\"\nGameSpot gave the port a 6.8 out of 10, generally praising the gameplay but musing that the port's graphical and technical differences from the original version of the game \"prevent this reissue from being as super as the original game.\"\n\nThe Game Boy Color port of the game also received wide critical appraisal; \"IGN\" Craig Harris gave \"Super Mario Bros. Deluxe\" a perfect score, praising it as a perfect translation of the NES game. He hoped that it would be the example for other NES games to follow when being ported to the Game Boy Color. GameSpot gave the game a 9.9, hailing it as the \"killer app\" for the Game Boy Color and praising the controls and the visuals (it was also the highest rated game in the series, later surpassed by \"Super Mario Galaxy 2\" which holds a perfect 10). Both gave it their Editors' Choice Award. \"Allgame\" Colin Williamson praised the porting of the game as well as the extras, noting the only flaw of the game being that sometimes the camera goes with Mario as he jumps up. \"Nintendo World Report\" Jon Lindemann, in 2009, called it their \"(Likely) 1999 NWR Handheld Game of the Year,\" calling the quality of its porting and offerings undeniable. Nintendo Life gave it a perfect score, noting that it retains the qualities of the original game and the extras. \"St. Petersburg Times\" Robb Guido commented that in this form, \"Super Mario Bros.\" \"never looked better.\" The \"Lakeland Ledger\" Nick S. agreed, praising the visuals and the controls. In 2004, a Game Boy Advance port of \"Super Mario Bros.\" (part of the Classic NES Series) was released, which had none of the extras or unlockables available in \"Super Mario Bros. Deluxe\". Of that version, \"IGN\" noted that the version did not \"offer nearly as much as what was already given on the Game Boy Color\" and gave it an 8.0 out of 10. \"Super Mario Bros. Deluxe\" ranked third in the best-selling handheld game charts in the U.S. between June 6 and 12, 1999 and sold over 2.8 million copies in the U.S. It was included on Singapore Airlines flights in 2006. Lindemann noted \"Deluxe\" as a notable handheld release in 1999.\n\nThe success of \"Super Mario Bros.\" led to the development of many successors in the \"Super Mario\" series of video games, which in turn form the core of the greater \"Mario\" franchise. Two of these sequels, \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" and \"Super Mario Bros. 3\", were direct sequels to the game and were released for the NES, experiencing similar levels of commercial success. A different sequel, also titled \"Super Mario Bros. 2\", was released for the Famicom Disk System in 1986 exclusively in Japan, and was later released elsewhere as a part of \"Super Mario All-Stars\" under the name \"\". The gameplay concepts and elements established in \"Super Mario Bros.\" are prevalent in nearly every \"Super Mario\" game. The series consists of over 15 entries; at least one \"Super Mario\" game has been released on nearly every Nintendo console to date. \"Super Mario 64\", an entry in the series and the first to take place in a three-dimensional environment, is widely considered one of the greatest games ever made, and is largely credited with revolutionizing the platforming genre of video games and its step from 2D to 3D. The most recent release is \"Super Mario Odyssey\", released in 2017 for the Nintendo Switch. The series is one of the best-selling, with over 310 million copies of games sold worldwide as of September 2015. In 2010, Nintendo released special red variants of the Wii and Nintendo DSi XL consoles in re-packaged, Mario-themed limited edition bundles as part of the 25th anniversary of the game's original release. To celebrate the series' 30th anniversary, Nintendo released \"Super Mario Maker\", a game for the Wii U which allows players to create custom platforming stages using assets from \"Super Mario\" games and in the style of \"Super Mario Bros.\" along with other styles based around different games in the series.\n\nThe game's success helped to push Mario as an American cultural icon; in 1990, a study taken in North America suggested that more children in the United States were familiar with Mario than they were with Mickey Mouse, another popular media character. The game's musical score composed by Koji Kondo, particularly the game's \"overworld\" theme, has also become a prevalent aspect of popular culture, with the latter theme being featured in nearly every single \"Super Mario\" game. Alongside the NES platform as a whole, \"Super Mario Bros.\" is often credited for having resurrected the video game industry after it had experienced a market crash in 1983.\n\n\"Super Mario Bros.\" and its sequels inspired various projects in media; the 1986 anime film \"\" is acknowledged as one of the first feature-length films to be based directly off of a video game. A live-action film based on the game was released theatrically in 1993, starring Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo as Mario and Luigi, respectively. An American animated television series titled \"The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!\" ran from 1989 to 1990, starring professional wrestler Lou Albano as Mario and Danny Wells as Luigi. An animated film based on the series created by Illumination Entertainment is currently in production.\n\nIn the United States Supreme Court case \"Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association\", the Electronic Frontier Foundation submitted an \"amicus\" brief which supported the overturn a law which would ban violent video games in the state of California. The brief cited social research that declared \"Super Mario Bros\", among several others, to contain cartoon violence similar to that found in children's programs such as Mighty Mouse and Road Runner that garnered little negative reaction from the public.\n\nVideo game developer Yuji Naka has cited \"Super Mario Bros.\" as a large inspiration towards the concept for the immensely successful 1991 Sega Genesis game, \"Sonic the Hedgehog\"; according to Naka, the general idea for the game first materialized when he was playing through game and trying to beat the game’s first level as quickly as possible, and thought about the concept of a platformer based around moving as fast as possible.\n\n\"Super Mario Bros.\" has served as inspiration for several fangames. In 2009, developer SwingSwing released \"Tuper Tario Tros\", a game which combines elements of \"Super Mario Bros.\" with \"Tetris\". \"Super Mario Bros. Crossover\", a PC fangame developed by Jay Pavlina and released in 2010 as a free browser-based game, is a full recreation of \"Super Mario Bros.\" that allows the player to alternatively control various other characters from Nintendo games, including Mega Man, Link from \"The Legend of Zelda\", Samus from \"Metroid\", and Simon Belmont from \"Castlevania\". \"Mari0\", released in December 2012, combines elements of the game with that of Portal by giving Mario a portal gun which he can use to seamlessly transport from one area of a level to another, while \"Full Screen Mario\" (2013) adds a level editor. In 2015, game designer Josh Millard released \"Ennuigi\", a metafictional fangame with commentary on the original game which relates to Luigi's inability to come to terms with the game's overall lack of narrative.\n\n"}
{"id": "356690", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=356690", "title": "The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening", "text": "The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening is a 1993 action-adventure video game developed by Nintendo Entertainment Analysis & Development and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy. It is the fourth installment in \"The Legend of Zelda\" series, and the first for a handheld game console.\n\n\"Link's Awakening\" began as a port of the Super NES title \"\", developed after-hours by Nintendo staff. It grew into an original project under the direction of Takashi Tezuka, with a story and script created by Yoshiaki Koizumi and Kensuke Tanabe. It is one of the few \"Zelda\" games not to take place in the land of Hyrule, and does not feature Princess Zelda or the Triforce relic. Instead, protagonist Link begins the game stranded on Koholint Island, a place guarded by a whale-like deity called the Wind Fish. Assuming the role of Link, the player fights monsters and solves puzzles while searching for eight musical instruments that will awaken the sleeping Wind Fish and allow him to escape from the island.\n\n\"Link's Awakening\" was critically and commercially successful. Critics praised the game's depth and number of features; complaints focused on its control scheme and monochrome graphics. An updated re-release titled The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX was released for the Game Boy Color in 1998 featuring color graphics, compatibility with the Game Boy Printer, and an exclusive color-based dungeon. Together, the two versions of the game have sold more than six million units worldwide, and have appeared on multiple game publications' lists of the best games of all time.\n\nUnlike most \"The Legend of Zelda\" titles, \"Link's Awakening\" is set outside the kingdom of Hyrule. It omits locations and characters from previous games, aside from protagonist Link and a passing mention of Princess Zelda. Instead, the game takes place entirely on Koholint Island, an isolated landmass cut off from the rest of the world. The island, though small, contains a large number of secrets and interconnected pathways.\n\nIn \"Link's Awakening\", the player is given advice and directions by non-player characters such as Ulrira, a shy old man who communicates with Link exclusively by telephone. The game contains cameo appearances by characters from other Nintendo titles, such as Wart, Yoshi, Kirby, Dr. Wright (renamed Mr. Write) from the Super NES version of \"SimCity\", and the exiled prince Richard from \"Kaeru no Tame ni Kane wa Naru\". Chomp, an enemy from the \"Mario\" series, was included after a programmer gave Link the ability to grab the creature and take it for a walk. Enemies from \"Super Mario Bros.\" such as Goombas also appear in underground side-scrolling sections; Link may land on top of them much as with \"Super Mario Bros.\", or he can attack them in the usual way: the two methods yield different bonuses. Director Takashi Tezuka said that the game's \"freewheeling\" development made \"Link's Awakening\" seem like a parody of \"The Legend of Zelda\" series. Certain characters in the game break the fourth wall; for example, little children inform the player of game mechanics such as saving, but admit that they do not understand the advice they are giving.\n\nAfter the events of , the hero Link travels by ship to other countries to train for further threats. A storm destroys his boat at sea, and he washes ashore on Koholint Island, where he is taken to the house of Tarin by his daughter Marin. She is fascinated by Link and the outside world, and tells Link wishfully that, if she were a seagull, she would leave and travel across the sea. After Link recovers his sword, a mysterious owl tells him that he must wake the Wind Fish, Koholint's guardian, in order to return home. The Wind Fish lies dreaming in a giant egg on top of Mt. Tamaranch, and can only be awakened by the eight Instruments of the Sirens.\n\nLink proceeds to explore a series of dungeons in order to recover the eight instruments. During his search for the sixth instrument, Link goes to the Ancient Ruins. There he finds a mural that details the reality of the island: that it is merely a dream world created by the Wind Fish. After this revelation, the owl tells Link that this is only a rumor, and only the Wind Fish knows for certain whether it is true. Throughout Koholint Island, nightmare creatures attempt to obstruct Link's quest for the instruments, as they wish to rule the Wind Fish's dreamworld.\n\nAfter collecting all eight instruments from the eight dungeons across Koholint, Link climbs to the top of Mt. Tamaranch and plays the Ballad of the Wind Fish. This breaks open the egg in which the Wind Fish sleeps; Link enters and confronts the last evil being, a Nightmare that takes the form of Ganon and other enemies from Link's past. Its final transformation is \"DethI\", a cyclopean, dual-tentacled Shadow. After Link defeats DethI, the owl reveals itself to be the Wind Fish's spirit, and the Wind Fish confirms that Koholint is all his dream. When Link plays the Ballad of the Wind Fish again, he and the Wind Fish awaken; Koholint Island and all its inhabitants slowly disappear. Link finds himself lying on driftwood in the middle of the ocean, with the Wind Fish flying overhead. If the player did not lose any lives during the game, Marin is shown flying after the ending credits finish - she is shown in the form of a winged woman when played in the original black and white format, while she takes the form of a seagull if played with color in the DX version.\n\nLike most games in \"The Legend of Zelda\" series, \"Link's Awakening\" is an action-adventure game focused on exploration and combat. The majority of the game takes place from an overhead perspective. The player traverses the overworld of Koholint Island while fighting monsters and exploring underground dungeons. Dungeons steadily become larger and more difficult, and feature \"Nightmare\" boss characters that the player must defeat, taking different forms in each dungeon, and getting harder to defeat each time. Success earns the player heart containers, which increase the amount of damage the player character can survive; when all of the player's heart containers have been emptied, the game restarts at the last doorway entered by the character. Defeating a Nightmare also earns the player one of the eight instruments necessary to complete the game.\n\n\"Link's Awakening\" was the first overhead-perspective \"Zelda\" game to allow Link to jump; this enables sidescrolling sequences similar to those in the earlier \"\". Players can expand their abilities with items, which are discovered in dungeons and through character interactions. Certain items grant access to previously inaccessible areas, and are needed to enter and complete dungeons.\n\nIn addition to the main quest, \"Link's Awakening\" contains side-missions and diversions. Collectible \"secret seashells\" are hidden throughout the game; when twenty of these are found, the player can receive a powerful sword that fires energy beams when the player character is at full health, similar to the sword in the original \"The Legend of Zelda\". \"Link's Awakening\" is the first \"Zelda\" game to include a trading sequence minigame: the player may give a certain item to a character, who in turn gives the player another item to trade with someone else. It is also the first game in the \"Zelda\" series in which both the A and B buttons may be assigned to a variety of items, which enables more varied puzzles and item combinations. Other series elements originating in \"Link's Awakening\" include fishing, and learning special songs on an ocarina; the latter mechanic is central to the next \"Zelda\" game released, \"\".\n\n\"Link's Awakening\" began as an unsanctioned side project; programmer Kazuaki Morita created a \"Zelda\"-like game with one of the first Game Boy development kits, and used it to experiment with the platform's capabilities. Other staff members of the Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development division joined him after-hours, and worked on the game in what seemed to them like an \"afterschool club\". The results of these experiments with the Game Boy started to look promising, and following the 1991 release of the Super NES video game \"\", director Takashi Tezuka asked permission to develop a handheld \"Zelda\" title; he intended it to be a port of \"A Link to the Past\", but it evolved into an original game. The majority of the team that had created \"A Link to the Past\" was reassembled to advance this new project. Altogether, it took them one and a half years to develop \"Link's Awakening\".\n\nTezuka recalled that the early free-form development of \"Link's Awakening\" resulted in the game's \"unrestrained\" contents, such as the unauthorized cameo appearances of characters from the \"Mario\" and \"Kirby\" series. \"A Link to the Past\" script writer Kensuke Tanabe joined the team early on, and came up with the basis of the story. Tezuka sought to make \"Link's Awakening\" a spin-off, and gave Tanabe instructions to omit common series elements such as Princess Zelda, the Triforce relic, and the setting Hyrule. As a consequence, Tanabe proposed his game world idea of an island with an egg on top of a mountain.\n\nLater on, Yoshiaki Koizumi, who had previously helped with the plot of \"A Link to the Past\", was brought into the team. Koizumi was responsible for the main story of \"Link's Awakening\", provided the idea of the island in a dream, and conceived the interactions with the villagers. \"Link's Awakening\" was described by series producer Eiji Aonuma as the first \"Zelda\" game with a proper plot, which he attributed to Koizumi's romanticism. Tezuka intended the game's world to have a similar feeling to the American television series \"Twin Peaks\", which, like \"Link's Awakening\", features characters in a small town. He suggested that the characters of \"Link's Awakening\" be written as \"suspicious types\", akin to those in \"Twin Peaks\"—a theme which carried over into later \"Zelda\" titles. Tanabe created these \"odd\" characters; he was placed in charge of the subevents of the story, and wrote almost all of the character dialog, with the exception of the owl's and the Wind Fish's lines. Tanabe implemented a previous idea of the world ending when a massive egg breaks on top of a mountain; this idea was originally meant for \"A Link to the Past\". Tanabe really wanted to see this idea in a game and was able to implement it in \"Link's Awakening\" as the basic concept.\n\nMasanao Arimoto and Shigefumi Hino designed the game's characters, while Yoichi Kotabe served as illustrator. Save for the opening and the ending, all pictures in the game were drawn by Arimoto. Yasahisa Yamamura designed the dungeons, which included the conception of rooms and routes, as well as the placement of enemies. Shigeru Miyamoto, who served as the producer of \"Link's Awakening\", did not provide creative input to the staff members. However, he participated as game tester, and his opinions greatly influenced the latter half of the development.\n\nThe music for \"Link's Awakening\" was composed by Minako Hamano and Kozue Ishikawa, for whom it was their first game project. Kazumi Totaka was responsible for the sound programming and all sound effects. As with most \"Zelda\" games, \"Link's Awakening\" includes a variation of the recurring overworld music; the Game Boy arrangement of this theme, titled \"Field\", was created by Ishikawa. The staff credits theme, \"Yume o Miru Shima e\" was later arranged for orchestra by Yuka Tsujiyoko, and performed at the \"Orchestral Game Music Concert 3\" in 1993. \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\" includes a remix of the game's \"Tal Tal Heights\" theme.\n\nIn an interview about the evolution of the \"Zelda\" series, Aonuma called \"Link's Awakening\" the \"quintessential isometric \"Zelda\" game\". At another time, he stated that, had the game not come after \"A Link to the Past\", \"\" would have been very different. Several elements from \"Link's Awakening\" were re-used in later \"Zelda\" titles; for example, programmer Morita created a fishing minigame that reappeared in \"Ocarina of Time\", among others. Tanabe implemented a trading sequence; Tezuka compared it to the Japanese Straw Millionaire folktale, in which someone trades up from a piece of straw to something of greater value. This concept also appeared in most sequels.\n\nTo support the North American release of \"Link's Awakening\", Nintendo sponsored a crosscountry train competition called the Zelda Whistle Stop Tour. The event, which lasted three days, allowed select players to test \"Link's Awakening\" in a timed race to complete the game. The event was meant not only to showcase the game, but also the Game Boy's superior battery life and portability, the latter of which was critical to the accessibility of a portable \"Zelda\" title. The company-owned magazine \"Nintendo Power\" published a guide to the game's first three areas in its July 1993 issue.\n\nIn 1998, to promote the launch of the Game Boy Color, Nintendo re-released \"Link's Awakening\" as \"The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX\". It features fully colorized graphics and is backward compatible with the original Game Boy. \"Link's Awakening DX\" contains a new optional dungeon, with unique enemies and puzzles based on color (due to this the dungeon cannot be accessed on the earlier non-color Game Boy models). After completing the dungeon, the player may choose to receive either a red or blue tunic, which increase attack and defense, respectively. The \"DX\" version also allows players to take photos after the player visits a camera shop, its owner will appear in certain locations throughout the game. A total of twelve photos can be taken, which may be viewed at the shop, or printed with the Game Boy Printer accessory. For \"Link's Awakening DX\", Tezuka returned as project supervisor, with Yoshinori Tsuchiyama as the new director. Nobuo Matsumiya collaborated with Tsuchiyama on applying changes to the original script; for example, hint messages were added to the boss battles. For the new dungeon, Yuichi Ozaki created a musical piece based on Kondo's dungeon theme from the original \"The Legend of Zelda\".\n\nIn 2010, Nintendo announced that the \"DX\" version would be re-released on the Virtual Console of the Nintendo 3DS, and became available June 2011. In July 2013, \"Link's Awakening DX\" was offered as one of several Virtual Console games which \"elite status\" members of the North America Club Nintendo could redeem as a free gift.\n\n\"Link's Awakening\" was critically acclaimed, and holds an average score of 90% on aggregate site GameRankings. In a retrospective article, \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" writer Jeremy Parish called \"Link's Awakening\" the \"best Game Boy game ever\". \"Game Informer\"s Ben Reeves called it the third best Game Boy game and called it influential. \"The Washington Post\"s Chip Carter declared that Nintendo had created a \"legend that fits in the palm of your hand\", and praised its portability and depth. An Jōkiri of ITMedia echoed similar comments. A writer for the \"Mainichi Shimbun\" enjoyed the game's music and story. Multiple sources touted it as an excellent portable adventure for those without the time for more sophisticated games.\n\nComplaints about the game included its monochrome graphics; certain critics believed that they made it difficult to discern the screen's contents, and wished that the game was in color. Critic William Burrill dismissed the game's visuals as \"Dim Boy graphics [that are] nothing to write home about\". Both Carter and \"The Ottawa Citizen\"s Bill Provick found the two-button control scheme awkward, as they needed to switch items on almost every screen. \"The Vancouver Sun\"s Katherine Monk called the dialogue \"stilted\", but considered the rest of the game to be \"ever-surprising\".\n\n\"Link's Awakening DX\" also received positive reviews; based on ten media outlets, it holds an average score of 92% on Game Rankings. IGN's Adam Cleveland awarded the game a perfect score, and noted that \"throughout the color-enhanced version of \"Zelda DX\", it can easily be inferred that Nintendo has reworked its magic to fit new standards\", by adding new content while keeping the original game intact. Cameron Davis of GameSpot applauded the game's camera support and attention to detail in coloration and style, while reviewers for the \"Courier Mail\" believed that the camera added gameplay depth and allowed players to show off trophies. \"The Daily Telegraph\"s Samantha Amjadali wrote that the addition of color made the game easier by reducing deaths caused by indistinct graphics. \"Total Games\" noted that the new content added little to the game, but found it addictive to play nonetheless.\n\n\"Link's Awakening\" sold well, and helped boost Game Boy sales 13 percent in 1993—making it one of Nintendo's most profitable years in North America up to that time. The game remained on bestseller lists for more than 90 months after release, and went on to sell 3.83 million units by 2004. The \"DX\" version sold another 2.22 million units.\n\nThe game won several awards, including those in the Game Boy categories for Graphics and Sound, Challenge, Theme and Fun, Play Control, and Best Overall in the reader-chosen 1993 \"Nintendo Power\" Awards. It was awarded Best Game Boy Game of 1993 by \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\". \"Nintendo Power\" later named it the fifty-sixth best Nintendo game, and, in August 2008, listed the \"DX\" version as the second best Game Boy or Game Boy Color game. IGN's readers ranked it as the 40th best game of all time, while the staff placed it at 78th; the staff believed that, \"while handheld spin-offs are generally considered the low point for game franchises, \"Link's Awakening\" proves that they can offer just as rich a gameplay experience as their console counterparts\". The game took 42nd place on the Guinness World Records' 2009 list of the top 50 most important and influential video games of all time.\n"}
{"id": "526277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=526277", "title": "Tin Toy", "text": "Tin Toy\n\nTin Toy is a 1988 American computer-animated short film produced by Pixar and directed by John Lasseter. The short film, which runs five minutes, stars Tinny, a tin one-man-band toy, attempting to escape from Billy, a destructive baby. The third short film produced by the company's small animation division, it was a risky investment: due to low revenue produced by Pixar's main product, the Pixar Image Computer, the company was under financial constraints.\n\nLasseter pitched the concept for \"Tin Toy\" by storyboard to Pixar owner Steve Jobs, who agreed to finance the short despite the company's struggles, which he kept alive with annual investment. The film was officially a test of the PhotoRealistic RenderMan software, and proved new challenges to the animation team, namely the difficult task of realistically animating Billy. \"Tin Toy\" later gained attention from Disney, who sealed an agreement to create \"Toy Story\" starring Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, which was primarily inspired by elements from \"Tin Toy\".\n\nThe short premiered in a partially completed edit at the SIGGRAPH convention in August 1988 to a standing ovation from scientists and engineers. \"Tin Toy\" went on to claim Pixar's first Oscar with the 1988 Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, becoming the first CGI film to win an Oscar. With the award, \"Tin Toy\" went far to establish computer animation as a legitimate artistic medium outside SIGGRAPH and the animation-festival film circuit. \"Tin Toy\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" in 2003.\n\nThe film takes place in one room and stars the toy of the title, a mechanical one-man band player named Tinny, and a baby named Billy. At first, Tinny is delighted at the prospect of being played with by Billy until he sees how destructive the baby can be. When Tinny tries to walk out of Billy's reach, the musical instruments on the toy's back play notes, attracting Billy's attention. Tinny begins to run, but is chased by Billy. Tinny soon finds cover under the couch, only to find that many other toys have also hidden themselves from Billy there since they are also afraid and have learned the same experience. While walking and trying to find Tinny and the other toys, Billy falls flat onto the floor and begins to cry. Tinny, feeling sorry for the baby, goes to the child to cheer him up. Billy stops crying upon seeing Tinny, cheers up, and grabs Tinny, but plays with him by shaking him, and finds the box Tinny was packaged in even more fun to play with. Mad, Tinny follows Billy around the room in an attempt to get his attention, but is still ignored, when the baby is instead happier playing with boxes and a shopping bag while some toys come out from the couch to play.\n\nPixar, purchased in 1986 by entrepreneur and former Apple Computer head Steve Jobs, received many accolades for films produced by its small animation division, headed by animator John Lasseter. Lasseter's primary role, as defended to Jobs by company founders Edwin Catmull and Alvy Ray Smith, was to produce short films to promote the company's own Pixar Image Computers. The department was never meant to generate any revenue as far as Jobs was concerned, but after the release of two shorts, \"Luxo Jr.\" (1986) and \"Red's Dream\" (1987), some of the engineers working on the company's products wondered whether it made sense to keep the animation group going at all. Pixar was losing money every year and Jobs was supporting the cash-strapped company through a line of credit with his personal guarantee.\n\nThe engineers felt they were working hard to make money for Pixar while Lasseter's group was only spending it. Their passion was for building computers and software, not entertainment. Eventually, they discerned, to their chagrin, the reason why the company was supporting the division: the real priority of Catmull and Smith was to make films. The engineers were not alone in wondering about the value of Lasseter's short films. On repeated occasions in the late 1980s, Catmull barely dissuaded Jobs from shutting down the animation division due to financial constraints. At this same time, Jobs was clashing with Alvy Ray Smith, which would eventually lead to his resignation from Pixar after a heated argument during a meeting. Things were by no means well at the company and Lasseter and his team of animators knew this, and were afraid to ask for money to finance another short, which they storyboarded as \"Tin Toy\".\n\nIn the spring of 1988, cash was running so short that Jobs convened a meeting to decree deep spending cuts across the board. When it was over, Lasseter and his animation group were almost too afraid to ask Jobs about authorizing some extra money for another short. Finally, they broached the topic and Jobs sat silent, looking skeptical. The short would require close to $300,000 more out of his pocket. After a few minutes, he asked if there were any storyboards. Catmull took him down to the animation offices, and Lasseter started his show. With the storyboards pinned on his wall, Lasseter did the voices and acted out the shots—just as story men had done on the Disney lot for decades—and thereby showed his passion for the project. The stakes here were much higher than before, however. Ralph Guggenheim, manager of the animation unit, recalled, \"We knew that he wasn't just pitching for the film, he was pitching for the survival of the group.\" Jobs warmed up to the project and agreed to provide the money. \"I believed in what John was doing,\" Jobs later said. \"It was art. He cared, and I cared. I always said yes.\" His only comment at the end of Lasseter’s presentation was, \"All I ask of you, John, is to make it great.\"\n\nThat fall, after completion of \"Red's Dream\", most members of the company gathered at Stillwater Cove, near Fort Ross, to design a new software that was designed completely for the work of an animator. From the meeting came Menv software (\"modeling Environment\"), the first program specifically designed to facilitate the workflow of an animator, separating the various phases of the animation (modeling, animation and lighting), later renamed \"Puppets\". To show the application of the new program, it was approved the production of a short. Inspired by the birth of his daughter Julia, William Reeves proposed the idea to create a human baby. Lasseter had an inspiration for the new opera based on the observation of his nephew, intent to put any toy in the mouth on the way. Lasseter said \"In terms of toys the child must have seemed a terrible monster!\"\n\nThe story was about Lasseter’s love, classic toys, and was inspired by a visit made in 1987 at the Tin Toy Museum in Yokohama, Japan. It was told from the perspective of a toy one-man band named Tinny, who meets a baby that charms and terrorizes him. Escaping under the couch, Tinny finds other frightened toys, but when the baby hits his head and cries, Tinny goes back out to cheer him up. \"Tin Toy\" was inspired much like \"Luxo Jr.\", namely, Lasseter's observations of a friend's baby. This time, he opted for a more ambitious task, attempting to mimic a human baby in its appearance, the movement of its arms, and its fickle moods.\n\nThe film was officially a test of the PhotoRealistic RenderMan software. This was the only Pixar short rendered on the RM-1, a RenderMan specific computer that was never sold to the public. As with \"Luxo Jr.\" and \"Red's Dream\", it was also a chance for Lasseter to one-up his earlier efforts, taking his animation and storytelling to another level. The baby proved difficult to model and animate; \"it just became an incredible burden,\" remembered Flip Phillips, a new member of the team at the time. In early attempts at a model of the baby's head, he appeared to have the face of a middle-aged man. The final version of the baby (known to the team as Billy) had a much-improved face with 40 separate facial muscles, but his skin had the look of plastic. When he moved, moreover, his body lacked the natural give of baby fat and his diaper had the solidity of cement—compromises made necessary by lack of time and the still-developing technology.\n\nThe picture on the table is a photograph of director John Lasseter.\n\nLasseter and his technical directors slept under their desks at times to get \"Tin Toy\" finished before SIGGRAPH in Atlanta in August 1988, but to no avail. What the SIGGRAPH audience saw was the first three-fifths or so of the film, ending a cliffhanger moment with Tinny running into his box and watching in horror through the box's cellophane as Billy advances towards him. \"Even though it wasn't complete, people were wowed by it,\" producer Ralph Guggenheim remembered. The audience of scientists and engineers to which it was shown at SIGGRAPH greeted it with a standing ovation. These praises were joined over the years, positive assessments of public and critics, who praised the innovation and technology in it. Luke Bonanno called it \"One of the best Pixar short films,\" while other critics wrote that the film was \"A fascinating glimpse of a fledgling art form.\" and many praised the ability to move in just a few minutes and have been able to \"encompass the full range of emotions you feel when a toy is used by a child.\" Some criticisms were leveled at the character of Billy, who was called \"the most frightening and disturbing piece of animation in the history of this art form.\" Dario Floreano stated that the uncanny valley concept was taken seriously by the film industry because of negative audience reactions to Billy. It is unknown when this short was first released in its entirety.\n\n\"Tin Toy\" went on to take the Academy Award for Best Animated Short in 1989 at the 61st Academy Awards and was the first computer generated animated short film to receive an Oscar. With the award, \"Tin Toy\" went far to establish computer animation as a legitimate artistic medium outside SIGGRAPH and the animation-festival film circuit. A member of the Academy's board of governors, animator William Littlejohn, saw in \"Tin Toy\" a window into the potential of the young medium. \"There is a realism that's rather astonishing,\" he told \"The New York Times\". \"It emulates photography, but with artistic staging.\" Robert Winquist, head of the character animation program at CalArts, went farther, predicting that computer animation was \"going to take over in a short time.\" He publicly advised animators, \"Put down your pencil and your paintbrush and do it another way.\"\n\nThe short was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" in 2003.\n\n1988 - Best Animated Short Film\n\n1989 - Seattle International Film Festival - Best Short Film<br>1989 - World Animation Celebration - Best Computer-Assisted Animation<br>2003 - National Film Registry\n\nApart from the home video editions of the short film, \"Tin Toy\" was not the subject of any type of merchandise, like all the other short films produced by the company. The only exception is the reproduction of vinyl Tinny, produced by MINDStyle in 2010. Pixar, in fact, sold the license to the manufacturer of \"Tin Toy\" MINDStyle objects, which created a marquette of the vinyl character Tinny inside of the line Art Toy Collectible limited Edition of 500 pieces, the price of ninety dollars. The box, which is a faithful reproduction of the packaging of the toy view in short, in addition to containing the model of Tinny, presents a certificate of authenticity printed on a card showing the storyboard in pencil of a scene from the short.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Pixar began to make arrangements with Disney to produce the first computer-animated film. The project went through, but considering the abrupt transition from shorts to feature a few minutes to an hour and a half, Pixar set out to create a special half-hour to see if they could manage a production that was similar to that of an actual film. Driven by the victory at the Oscars that year, a sequel to \"Tin Toy\" called \"A Tin Toy Christmas,\" was originally planned as a half-hour-long television special to be used to convince film studios that Pixar was capable of producing a feature film. This idea was brought to the table at the initial talks with Disney for \"Toy Story\". The basic idea was that Tinny was part of a set of toy players who are not successful and remain unsold for years. Separated from other components, Tinny ends up by mistake in a toy shop of our age where he meets several characters, including a soft pink bear named Lotso.\n\nThe project was abandoned because the television network that would have produced it could not afford the fees required (according to director Pete Docter, the special would have required a sum of eighteen times higher than the allowed budget). Disney was uninterested in the concept and urged Pixar to produce a feature immediately, which became a critical and commercial success. The character of Lotso, however, was adapted for the third installment of the \"Toy Story\" series.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "89637", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=89637", "title": "Vulgarism", "text": "Vulgarism\n\nIn the study of language and literary style, a vulgarism is an expression or usage considered non-standard or characteristic of uneducated speech or writing. In colloquial or lexical English, \"vulgarism\" or \"vulgarity\" may be synonymous with profanity or obscenity, but a linguistic or literary vulgarism encompasses a broader category of perceived fault not confined to scatological or sexual offensiveness. These faults may include errors of pronunciation, misspellings, word malformations, and malapropisms. \"Vulgarity\" is generally used in the more restricted sense. In regular and mostly informal conversations, the presence of vulgarity, if any, are mostly for intensifying, exclaiming or scolding. In modern times, vulgarism continues to be frequently used by people. A research paper produced by Oxford University in 2005 shows that the age group of 10-21 years old speak more vulgarity than the rest of the world's population combined. The frequent and prevalent usage of vulgarity as a whole has led to a paradox, in which people use vulgarity so often that it becomes less and less offensive to people, according to the New York Times.\n\nThe English word \"vulgarism\" derives ultimately from Latin \"vulgus,\" \"the common people\", often as a pejorative meaning \"the [unwashed] masses, undifferentiated herd, a mob\". In classical studies, Vulgar Latin as the Latin of everyday life is conventionally contrasted to Classical Latin, the literary language exemplified by the \"Golden Age\" canon (Cicero, Caesar, Vergil, Ovid, among others). This distinction was always an untenable mode of literary criticism, unduly problematizing, for instance, the so-called \"Silver Age\" novelist Petronius, whose complex and sophisticated prose style in the \"Satyricon\" is full of conversational vulgarisms.\n\nVulgarism has been a particular concern of British English traditionalists. In the 1920s, the English lexicographer Henry Wyld defined \"vulgarism\" as:a peculiarity which intrudes itself into Standard English, and is of such a nature as to be associated with the speech of vulgar or uneducated speakers. The origin of pure \"vulgarisms\" is usually that they are importations, not from a regional but from a class dialect—in this case from a dialect which is not that of a province, but of a low or uneducated social class. ... [A vulgarism] is usually a variety of Standard English, but a bad variety. The moral and aesthetic values explicit in such a definition depends on class hierarchy viewed as authoritative. For instance, the \"misuse\" of aspiration (H-dropping, such as pronouncing \"have\" as ave\") has been considered a mark of the lower classes in England at least since the late 18th century, as dramatized in \"My Fair Lady\". Because linguistic vulgarism betrayed social class, its avoidance became an aspect of etiquette. In 19th-century England, books such as \"The Vulgarisms and Improprieties of the English Language\" (1833) by W. H. Savage, reflected upper-middle-class anxieties about \"correctness and good breeding\".\n\nVulgarisms in a literary work may be used deliberately to further characterization, by use of \"eye dialect\" or simply by vocabulary choice.\n\n"}

This book describes a post-scarcity economy: all the necessities (and most of the luxuries) of life are free for the taking. A person's current Whuffie is instantly viewable to anyone, as everybody has a brain implant giving them an interface with the Net.\n\nThe term has since seen some adoption as a synonym for social capital, including its use in the title of the Tara Hunt book \"The Whuffie Factor\".\n\nIn 2016, Doctorow stated that Whuffie \"would make a terrible currency.\"\n\nIn the novel \"Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom\", industrial-era economic constraints and scarcity-management regimes have been made obsolete by technology: Whuffie has replaced money, providing an esteem- and admiration-rewarding motivation for people to do useful and creative things. A person's Whuffie is a general measurement of his or her overall reputation and is gained (or lost) according to a person's favorable (or unfavorable) actions. Public opinion determines which actions are favorable or unfavorable. The Whuffie of one who rudely pushes past others may suffer, as she incurs the disapprobation of those pushed, or witnesses of the event. A much-loved symphony, on the other hand, continues to earn the composer Whuffie as more people enjoy it. Some judgments contributing to an individual's Whuffie are automatic and require no conscious thought on the part of others, as all possess brain chips. As brain dumps allow machines to carry consciousness, the machines can do the thinking for people and allow them to know the results automatically.\n\nTwo different methods are explained as being right-hand (the amount you directly attribute to an action) and left-hand (an aggregate of the right-hand Whuffie of the people who have given you left-hand).\n\nExample: A person gave me 50 right-hand (direct) Whuffie for a song I wrote, that they like. I also received 100 left-hand Whuffie from the people that that person has also given right-hand Whuffie to (indirect).\n\nWhile there are few details in the novel of how this system actually works, it is described in idealistic terms:\n\nA person with a score of 0 is just as capable of giving and revoking Whuffie as someone with a score of 1,000,000. The person with the million-point score would be invited to parties and elite events while his bottomed-out counterpart would probably not even be allowed into reputable clubs or restaurants; but both of their opinions on someone else would count for the same amount of gross Whuffie.\n\nLike all economic systems, Whuffie has effects that seem undesirable to many. It might tend to favour popular speech at the expense of public discourse, and it could frequently be uninformative: if a person has a high Whuffie score, is it for guitar playing or auto repair? However, both of these are already the status quo under a money economy, and the concept of weighted Whuffie helps make better decisions on a person-by-person basis, and thus is more flexible than rating someone by their bank account. Also, the Whuffie system (in the book) keeps a public history of how each person's Whuffie was earned, unlike the secret origins of many people's money.\n\n\nThe Whuffie Bank launched as a non-profit company at the TechCrunch50 conference on September 15, 2009. The organization aims to create a reputation currency for social networks. However, their URL and Twitter feed became inactive on April 2012. As of December 2013 the website is inaccessible and relays the message \"No more Whuffies :'(.\"\n\nThe science fiction convention Penguicon is known for compensating its volunteers for their time using Whuffies. It can be traded in for T-shirts, a place to sleep overnight, or a refunded convention membership.\n\nDoctorow has indicated that the word \"Whuffie\" is a made-up word he used in high school, and is not a vocalization of an abbreviation (in the style of 'Gazoo' – GSU, or Grad Students Union) or of Wi-Fi as is often believed.\n\nWhuffie is mentioned in Doctorow's \"Eastern Standard Tribe\", but appears to be in the general sense of building reputation.\n"}
