Die Patriot, the first Afrikaans newspaper, was first published in 1876.\n\nThe Second Afrikaans Language Movement arose after the defeat of the Boers in the Second Anglo-Boer War, which ended in 1902. The movement, spreading from the Cape Province, led to the ascendancy of Afrikaans over the Dutch language, replacing the latter as the medium of instruction in schools, as the language of the Dutch Reformed churches, and ultimately as the co-official language of South Africa, in 1925.\n\nAfter apartheid ended in 1994, the status of Afrikaans within South Africa was much reduced. Afrikaans went from having equal status with English to being just one of 11 official languages, leading to a renewed dominance of English in the public sphere. Attempts to reverse the marginalisation of Afrikaans have been described as a third language movement.\n\n"}

The festival, in Cornwall is the liturgical feast day of St Allan (also spelled St Allen or St Arlan), who was the bishop of Quimper in the sixth century. As such, Allantide is also known as Allan Night and Allan Day. The origins of the name Allantide also probably stem from the same sources as Hollantide (Wales and the Isle of Man) and Hallowe'en itself. \nAs with the start of the celebration of Allhallowtide in the rest of Christendom, church bells were rung in order to comfort Christian souls in the intermediate state. Another important part of this festival was the giving of Allan apples, large glossy red apples that were highly polished, to family and friends as tokens of good luck. Allan apple markets used to be held throughout West Cornwall in the run up to the feast.\n\nThe following is a description of the festival as it was celebrated in Penzance at the turn of the 19th century:\n\n\":\"The shops in Penzance would display Allan apples, which were highly polished large apples. On the day itself, these apples were given as gifts to each member of the family as a token of good luck. Older girls would place these apples under their pillows and hope to dream of the person whom they would one day marry. A local game is also recorded where two pieces of wood were nailed together in the shape of a cross. It was then suspended with 4 candles on each outcrop of the cross shape. Allan apples would then be suspended under the cross. The goal of the game was to catch the apples in your mouth, with hot wax being the penalty for slowness or inaccuracy.\"\"\n\nRobert Hunt in his book 'Popular romances of the West of England' describes Allantide in St Ives \n\n\"THE ancient custom of providing children with a large apple on Allhallows-eve is still observed, to a great extent, at St Ives. \"Allan-day,\" as it is called, is the day of days to hundreds' of children, who would deem it a great misfortune were they to go to bed on \"Allan-night\" without the time-honoured Allan apple to hide beneath their pillows. A quantity of large apples are thus disposed of the sale of which is dignified by the term Allan Market.\"\n\nThere are a number of divination games recorded including the throwing of wall nuts in fires to predict the fidelity of partners and the pouring of molten lead into cold water as a way of predicting the occupation of future husbands, the shape of the solidified lead somehow indicating this.\n\nIn some parts of Cornwall \"Tindle\" fires were lit similar in nature to the Coel Coth (Coel Certh) of Wales.\n\nPrior to the 20th Century the parish feast of St Just in Penwith was known as Allantide.\n\n"}

A former resident of Fort Wayne, Indiana and longtime resident of the Florida Keys, Brandt committed suicide in September 2004 after he stabbed his wife, Teresa \"Teri\" Brandt, and decapitated and severely mutilated his niece, Michelle Jones, by removing her heart. An investigation by police concluded that Brandt hanged himself in Jones' garage after committing the murders.\n\nIt later came to light that Brandt had shot his parents – his pregnant mother fatally – in 1971, when he was 13; he spent one year at a psychiatric hospital before being released, and was never criminally charged. Because of this incident, and because of Brandt's efficiency in killing his wife and niece and his hidden obsession with human anatomy, investigators looked into the prospect that he had committed other murders since moving to Florida in 1973. Police have positively ascribed up to six homicides to Brandt.\n\nBrandt was the second child and only son of Herbert and Ilse Brandt, two German immigrants who originally lived in Connecticut. His father worked as a laborer for a division of International Harvester, eventually working his way up to draftsman and project engineer. However, the family frequently moved, and as a result, Brandt and his older sister Angela attended several different schools. He was regarded as a good student, but was shy and had difficulty adjusting to new surroundings. In September 1968, Herbert was transferred to International Harvester's plant in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Every summer and Christmas, the family would vacation in Florida, where Brandt went on hunting trips with his father.\n\nOn the night of January 3, 1971, Brandt, then 13, walked into his parents' bathroom while Herbert was shaving and Ilse, who was eight months pregnant, was taking a bath. Brandt shot both parents at point blank range; his father survived, but his mother died at the scene. Brandt then confronted his sister Angela, but his gun wouldn't fire. After a physical struggle, Angela managed to calm her brother down before she fled the house and sought help from neighbors. Brandt also left the house and knocked on the door of a girl next door named Sandi Radcliffe, telling her, \"Sandi, I just shot my mom and dad.\" Herbert Brandt later identified his son as his attacker.\n\nBecause he was too young to be charged with murder under Indiana law, Brandt appeared before a grand jury and was ordered to undergo three separate psychiatric evaluations, all of which couldn't determine what motivated him to shoot his parents. One of Brandt's psychiatrists, Ronald Pancner, later recounted, \"Basically, I was looking for mental illness. And he wasn't showing the signs and symptoms of serious mental illness, which I thought was what the court wanted to know.\" Interviews with Brandt's family and friends showed that he had no conflicts at home or at school, and had previously shown nothing but devotion to his mother. Brandt spent one year at a psychiatric hospital before being released back into the custody of his family. They never spoke of the incident again, and Brandt's younger sisters were never told about the shooting.\n\nShortly after Brandt's release, his family relocated to Florida. One year later, Brandt's father and sisters moved away after he remarried, while Brandt himself remained in Florida under the care of his grandparents. In 1984, Brandt got a degree on electronics and became a radar specialist. In 1986, he married his girlfriend Teri. No relatives were invited to their wedding. The couple settled in a beach house of Big Pine Key, the southernmost portion of the Florida Keys, in 1989. \n\nOn September 2, 2004, Brandt and Teri evacuated from their home ahead of Hurricane Ivan. Their niece, Michelle Lynn Jones, invited them to stay at her residence in near Orlando. Throughout the visit, Jones kept in regular contact with her mother, Mary Lou, as well as several friends. On the evening of September 13, one of Jones' friends, Lisa Emmons, was scheduled to visit her house. However, Jones discouraged her from coming after reporting that the Brandts had an argument after drinking. After that night, Jones stopped answering telephone calls, which alarmed her acquaintances.\n\nOn September 15, another one of Jones' friends, Debbie Knight, came to her house to check on her while on the phone with Jones' mother. After finding the front door locked, Knight tried to enter the house through the garage, where she found Brandt's decomposing body hanging from the rafters. Knight contacted the police, who entered the house and found the bodies of Brandt's wife and niece. Teri had been stabbed seven times in the chest while reclining on a couch. Jones had been decapitated and disemboweled, with her heart and organs removed. Jones' head was also placed next to her own body. The weapons used in the crimes had been knives from Jones' kitchen.\n\nA search of Brandt's residence on Big Pine Key revealed that he was a monthly subscriber to Victoria's Secret catalogs; had an extensive collection of surgery-themed books, posters, and clippings; and regularly searched online for autopsy photos and snuff film websites depicting violence against women. Because Brandt's murder of Jones indicated methodology and past experience, and because he traveled often due to his job, police checked cold cases in Florida that matched his apparent \"modus operandi\", and launched requests for similar inquiries in the United States and abroad. Ultimately, the search linked Brandt to twenty-six unsolved murders in Florida dating back to 1973.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "106155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=106155", "title": "Children's Crusade", "text": "Children's Crusade\n\nThe Children's Crusade was a failed popular crusade by European Christians to regain the Holy Land from the Muslims, said to have taken place in 1212. The crusaders left areas of Northern France, led by Stephen of Cloyes, and Germany, led by Nicholas. The traditional narrative is likely conflated from some factual and mythical events which include the visions by a French boy and a German boy, an intention to peacefully convert Muslims in the Holy Land to Christianity, bands of children marching to Italy, and children being sold into slavery. Many children were tricked by merchants and sailed over to what they thought were the holy lands but, in reality, were slave markets.\n\nThe variants of the long-standing story of the Children's Crusade have similar themes. A boy begins to preach in either France or Germany, claims that he had been visited by Jesus, who instructed him to lead a Crusade in order to peacefully convert Muslims to Christianity. Through a series of portents and miracles he gains a following of up to 30,000 children. He leads his followers south towards the Mediterranean Sea, in the belief that the sea would part on their arrival, which would allow him and his followers to walk to Jerusalem. This does not happen. The children are sold to two merchants (Hugh the Iron and William of Posqueres), who give free passage on boats to as many of the children as are willing. The pilgrims are then either taken to Tunisia, where they are sold into slavery by the merchants or else die in a shipwreck on San Pietro Island off Sardinia during a gale. A few may have failed to reach the sea, and die or give up from starvation and exhaustion. They had been betrayed by some of the adults in their group.\n\nAccording to more recent researchers there seem to have actually been two movements of people (of all ages) in 1212 in Germany and France. The similarities of the two allowed later chroniclers to combine and embellish the tales.\n\nIn the first movement, Nicholas, an eloquent shepherd from the Rhineland in Germany, tried to lead a group across the Alps and into Italy in the early spring of 1212. Nicholas said that the sea would dry up before them and allow his followers to cross into the Holy Land. Rather than intending to fight the Saracens, he said that the Muslim kingdoms would be defeated when their citizens converted to Christianity. His disciples went off to preach the call for the \"Crusade\" across the German lands, and they massed in Cologne after a few weeks. Splitting into two groups, the crowds took different roads through Switzerland. Two out of every three people on the journey died, while many others returned to their homes. About 7,000 arrived in Genoa in late August. They immediately marched to the harbor, expecting the sea to divide before them; when it did not many became bitterly disappointed. A few accused Nicholas of betraying them, while others settled down to wait for God to change his mind, since they believed that it was unthinkable he would not eventually do so. The Genovese authorities were impressed by the little band, and they offered citizenship to those who wished to settle in their city. Most of the would-be Crusaders took up this opportunity. Nicholas refused to say he was defeated and traveled to Pisa, his movement continuing to break up along the way. He and a few loyal followers continued to the Papal States, where they met Pope Innocent III. The remaining ones departed for Germany after the Pontiff exhorted them to be good and to return home to their families. Nicholas did not survive the second attempt across the Alps; back home his father was arrested and hanged under pressure from angry families whose relatives had perished while following the child.\n\nSome of the most dedicated members of this Crusade were later reported to have wandered to Ancona and Brindisi; none are known to have reached the Holy Land.\n\nThe second movement was led by a twelve-year-old French shepherd boy named Stephen of Cloyes, who said in June that he bore a letter for the king of France from Jesus. Large gangs of youth around his age were drawn to him, most of whom claimed to possess special gifts of God and thought themselves miracle workers. Attracting a following of over 30,000 adults and children, he went to Saint-Denis, where he was seen to cause miracles. On the orders of Philip II, advised by the University of Paris, the people were implored to return home. Philip himself did not appear impressed, especially since his unexpected visitors were led by a mere child, and refused to take them seriously. Stephen, however, was not dissuaded, and began preaching at a nearby abbey. From Saint-Denis, Stephen traveled around France, spreading his messages as he went, promising to lead charges of Christ to Jerusalem. Although the Church was skeptical, many adults were impressed by his teaching. A few of those who initially joined him possessed his activeness; it is estimated that there were less than half the initial 30,000 remaining, a figure that was shrinking rapidly, rather than growing as perhaps anticipated.\n\nAt the end of June 1212, Stephen led his largely juvenile Crusaders from Vendôme to Marseilles. They survived by begging for food, while the vast majority seem to have been disheartened by the hardship of this journey and returned to their families.\n\nAccording to Peter Raedts, professor in Medieval History at the Radboud University Nijmegen, there are only about 50 sources from the period that talk about the crusade, ranging from a few sentences to half a page. Raedts categorizes the sources into three types depending on when they were written:\n\nRaedts does not consider the sources after 1250 to be authoritative, and of those before 1250, he considers only about 20 to be authoritative. It is only in the later non-authoritative narratives that a \"children's crusade\" is implied by such authors as Vincent of Beauvais, Roger Bacon, Thomas of Cantimpré, Matthew Paris and many others.\n\nPrior to Raedts's study of 1977, there had only been a few historical publications researching the Children's Crusade. The earliest were by the Frenchman G. de Janssens (1891) and the German Reinhold Röhricht (1876). They analyzed the sources but did not analyze the story. American medievalist Dana Carleton Munro (1913–14), according to Raedts, provided the best analysis of the sources to date and was the first to significantly provide a convincingly sober account of the Crusade stripped of legends. Later, J. E. Hansbery (1938–9) published a correction of Munro's work, but it has since been discredited as based on an unreliable source. German psychiatrist Justus Hecker (1865) did give an original interpretation of the crusade, but it was a polemic about \"diseased religious emotionalism\" that has since been discredited.\n\nP. Alphandery (1916) first published his ideas about the crusade in 1916 in an article which was later published in book form in 1959. He considered the story of the crusade to be an expression of the medieval cult of the Innocents, as a sort of sacrificial rite in which the Innocents gave themselves up for the good of Christendom; however, he based his ideas on some of the most untrustworthy sources.\n\nAdolf Waas (1956) saw the Children's Crusade as a manifestation of chivalric piety and as a protest against the glorification of the holy war. H. E. Mayer (1960) further developed Alphandery's ideas of the Innocents, saying children were the chosen people of God because they were the poorest; recognizing the cult of poverty, he said that \"the Children's Crusade marked both the triumph and the failure of the idea of poverty.\" Giovanni Miccoli (1961) was the first to note that the contemporary sources did not portray the participants as children. It was this recognition that undermined all other interpretations, except perhaps that of Norman Cohn (1971) who saw it as a chiliastic movement in which the poor tried to escape the misery of their everyday lives. Peter Raedts's analysis of 1977 is considered the best source to date to cover the many issues surrounding the Children's Crusade.\n\nHistorians have put the crusade in the context of the role of teenage boys in medieval warfare. Literary scholars have explored its role in the evolution of the tale of the Pied Piper.\n\nBeyond the scientific studies there are many popular versions and theories about the Children's Crusades. Norman Zacour in the survey \"A History of the Crusades\" (1962) generally follows Munro's conclusions, and adds that there was a psychological instability of the age, concluding the Children's Crusade \"remains one of a series of social explosions, through which medieval men and women—and children too—found release\".\n\nSteven Runciman gives an account of the Children's Crusade in his \"A History of the Crusades\". Raedts notes that \"Although he cites Munro's article in his notes, his narrative is so wild that even the unsophisticated reader might wonder if he had really understood it.\" Donald Spoto, in a book about Saint Francis of Assisi, said monks were motivated to call them children, and not wandering poor, because being poor was considered pious and the Church was embarrassed by its wealth in contrast to the poor. This, according to Spoto, began a literary tradition from which the popular legend of children originated. This idea closely follows H. E. Mayer.\n\nThe Dutch historian Peter Raedts, in a study published in 1977, was the first to cast doubt on the traditional narrative of these events. Many historians came to believe that they were not (or not primarily) children, but multiple bands of \"wandering poor\" in Germany and France. A number of them tried to reach the Holy Land but others never intended to do so. Early accounts of events, of which there are many variations told over the centuries, are, according to this theory, largely apocryphal.\n\nMany works of art reference the Children's Crusade; this list is focused on works that are set in Middle Ages and focus primarily on a re-telling of the events.

{"id": "55563258", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55563258", "title": "Chorale", "text": "Chorale\n\nChorale is the name of several related musical forms originating in the music genre of the Lutheran chorale:\n\nThe chorale originated when Martin Luther forked sacred songs in vernacular language from established practices of church music near the end of the first quarter of the 16th century. The first hymnals according to Luther's new practice were published in 1524. Luther and his followers not only wrote metrical hymn lyrics, but also composed metrical musical settings for these texts. This music was partially based on established melodies of church hymns and known secular songs. In the 17th century the repertoire was enriched with more choral and organ settings of the chorale tunes. By the end of the century a four-part setting for SATB voices had become the standard for the choral settings, while the congregational singing of chorales was verging towards monody with an instrumental accompaniment. The prolific creation of new Lutheran chorale tunes ended around the same time.\n\nAfter the introduction in Lutheran churches, in the early 18th century, of the cantata genre, originally only consisting of recitatives and arias, the format was soon expanded with choral movements in the form of four-part chorales. Composers such as Johann Sebastian Bach and Gottfried Heinrich Stölzel placed these chorales often as a concluding movement at the end of their church compositions. The chorale as conclusion was emulated in more secular genres such as Romantic 19th-century symphonies. Other composers of that era, such as Franck, expanded the repertoire of the organ chorales, also emulating what late Baroque composers such as Bach had produced more than a century before. Entirely new chorale compositions became rare after the Romantic era, but by that time the four-part harmonisation technique, as exemplified in four-part chorales, had become part of the canon of Western music.\n\nIn German, the word may as well refer to Protestant congregational singing as to other forms of vocal (church) music, including Gregorian chant. The English word which derived from this German term, that is \"chorale\", however almost exclusively refers to the musical forms that originated in the German Reformation.\n\nThe bulk of Lutheran hymn texts and chorale melodies was created before the end of the 17th century.\n\nJohann Pachelbel's \"Erster Theil etlicher Choräle\", a set of organ chorales, was published in the last decade of the 17th century. Johann Sebastian Bach's earliest extant compositions, works for organ which he possibly wrote before his fifteenth birthday, include the chorales BWV 700, 724, 1091, 1094, 1097, 1112, 1113 and 1119.\n\nIn the early 18th century Erdmann Neumeister introduced the cantata format, originally consisting exclusively of recitatives and arias, in Lutheran liturgical music. Within a few years, the format was combined with other pre-existing liturgical formats such as the chorale concerto, resulting in church cantatas that consisted of free poetry, for instance used in recitatives and arias, dicta and/or hymn-based movements: the \"Sonntags- und Fest-Andachten\" cantata libretto cycle, published in Meiningen in 1704, contained such extended cantata texts. The chorale cantata, called \"per omnes versus\" (through all verses) when its libretto was an entire unmodified Lutheran hymn, was also a format modernised from earlier types. Dieterich Buxtehude composed six \"per omnes versus\" chorale settings. BWV 4, an early Bach-cantata composed in 1707, is in this same format. Later, for his 1720s second cantata cycle, Bach developed a chorale cantata format where the inner movements paraphrased (rather than quoted) text of the inner verses of the hymn on which the cantata was based.\n\nEach of the Meiningen cantata librettos contained a single chorale-based movement, on which it ended. Composers of the first half of the 18th century, such as Bach, Stölzel and Georg Philipp Telemann, often closed a cantata with a four-part chorale setting, whether or not the libretto of the cantata already contained verses of a Lutheran hymn. Bach set several of the Meiningen librettos in 1726, and Stölzel expanded the librettos of Benjamin Schmolck's \"Saitenspiel\" cycle with a closing chorale for each half cantata, when he set that cycle in the early 1720s. Two of such closing chorales by Telemann inadvertently ended up in the \"Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis\" (BWV): the fifth movements of the cantatas BWV 218 and 219, in the catalogue of Telemann's vocal works adopted as Nos. 1:634/5 and 1:1328/5 respectively. These closing chorales almost always conformed to these formal characteristics:\nAround 400 of such settings by Bach are known, with the colla parte instrumentation surviving for more than half of them. They do not only appear as closing movements of church cantatas: they can appear in other places in cantatas, even, exceptionally, opening a cantata (BWV 80b). Bach's \"Jesu, meine Freude\" motet contains several such chorales. Larger-scale compositions, such as Passions and oratorios, often contain multiple four-part chorale settings which in part define the composition's structure: for instance in Bach's \"St John\" and \"St Matthew\" Passions they often close units (scenes) before a next part of the narrative follows, and in the \"Wer ist der, so von Edom kömmt\" Passion pasticcio the narrative is carried by interspersed four-part chorale settings of nearly all stanzas of the \"Christus, der uns selig macht\" hymn.\n\nVocal church music of this period also contained other types of chorale settings, the general format of which is indicated as chorale fantasia: one voice, not necessarily the voice with the highest pitch, carries the chorale tune, with the other voices rather contrapuntal than homorhythmic, often with other melodies than the chorale tune, and instrumental interludes between the singing. For instance, the four cantatas with which Bach opened his second cantata cycle each start with a choral movement in chorale fantasia format, where the chorale tune is respectively sung by the soprano (BWV 20, 11 June 1724), alto (BWV 2, 18 June 1724), tenor (BWV 7, 24 June 1724) and bass (BWV 135, 25 June 1724) voices. Chorale fantasia settings are not necessarily choral movements: for instance, the fifth movement of the cantata BWV 10 is a duet for alto and tenor voices in that format. Quarter of a century after Bach had composed that duet, he published it in an arrangement for organ, as fourth of the \"Schübler Chorales\", showing that the chorale fantasia format adapts itself very well to purely instrumental genres such as the chorale prelude for organ. Around 200 of Bach's chorale preludes are extant, many of them in the chorale fantasia format (others are fugues, or homorhythmic settings).\n\nIn the first half of the 18th century, chorales also appear in (music performance in family circle), e.g. BWV 299 in \"Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach\", and/or are used for didactical purposes, e.g. BWV 691 in the .\n\nMost of Bach's four-part chorales, around 370 of them, were published for the first time between 1765 and 1787: it were the only works by the composer that were published between \"The Art of Fugue\" (1751) and the 50th anniversary of the composer's death in 1800. In the late 18th century symphonies could include a chorale movement: for instance the third movement of Joseph Martin Kraus's 1792 \"Symphonie funèbre\" is a chorale on (the Swedish version of) \"Nun lasst uns den Leib begraben\".\n\nEarly in the 19th century Ludwig van Beethoven chose a chorale-like ending for his Sixth Symphony (1808). Chorale analogies are even stronger in the choral finale of his Ninth Symphony (1824). Felix Mendelssohn, champion of the 19th-century Bach Revival, included a chorale (\"Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott\") in the finale of his \"Reformation Symphony\" (1830). His first oratorio, \"Paulus\", which premièred in 1836, featured chorales such as \"Allein Gott in der Höh sei Ehr\" and \"Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme\". His \"Lobgesang\" Symphony-Cantata (1840) contained a movement based on the Lutheran chorale \"Nun danket alle Gott\". Lutheran hymns also appear in the composer's chorale cantatas, some of his organ compositions, and the sketches of his unfinished \"Christus\" oratorio.\n\nIn the first half of the 19th century, chorale-like symphony finales were also composed by Louis Spohr (\"Begrabt den Leib in seiner Gruft\" concludes his 1832 Fourth Symphony, named \"Die Weihe der Töne\"), Niels Gade (Second Symphony, 1843) and others. Otto Nicolai wrote concert overtures on \"Vom Himmel hoch, da komm ich her\" (\"Christmas Overture\", 1833) and on \"Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott\" (\"Ecclesiastical Festival Overture\", 1844). Giacomo Meyerbeer set \"Ad nos, ad salutarem undam\" to a chorale melody of his own invention in his 1849 opera \"Le prophète\". The chorale tune was the basis for Franz Liszt's organ composition Fantasy and Fugue on the chorale \"Ad nos, ad salutarem undam\" (1850).\n\nJoachim Raff included Luther's \"Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott\" in his Overture Op. 127 (1854, revised 1865) and had his Fifth Symphony (\"Lenore\", Op. 177, 1872) end on a chorale. The Finale of Camille Saint-Saëns's contains a homorhythmic chorale. One of the themes in the Finale of his 1886 Third Symphony, that is the theme that was adopted in the 1978 \"If I Had Words\" song, is a chorale. Anton Bruckner's 1873 Third Symphony and his 1876 Fifth Symphony both end on a chorale played by brass instruments. Bruckner also used the chorale as a compositional device in Two Aequali. Further, he included chorales in masses and motets (e.g. \"Dir, Herr, dir will ich mich ergeben\", \"In jener letzten der Nächte\"), and in part 7 of his festive cantata \"Preiset den Herrn\". In his setting of Psalm 22 and in the Finale of his Fifth Symphony he used a chorale in contrast to and combination with a fugue. One of the themes in the Finale of Johannes Brahms's First Symphony (1876) is a chorale.\n\nIn 1881 Sergei Taneyev described chorale harmonisations, such as those ending Bach's cantatas, rather as a necessary evil: inartistic, but unavoidable, even in Russian church music. From the 1880s Ferruccio Busoni was adopting chorales in his instrumental compositions, often adapted from or inspired by models by Johann Sebastian Bach: for example BV 186 (), an introduction and fugue on \"Herzliebster Jesu was hast verbrochen\", No. 3 of Bach's \"St Matthew Passion\". In 1897 he transcribed Liszt's Fantasy and Fugue on the chorale \"Ad nos, ad salutarem undam\" for piano. César Franck emulated the chorale in compositions for piano (\"Prélude, Choral et Fugue\", 1884) and for organ (\"\", 1990). Johannes Zahn published an index and classification of all known Evangelical hymn tunes in six volumes from 1889 to 1893.\n\nA chorale-like theme appears throughout the last movement of Gustav Mahler's Third Symphony (1896):\n<score vorbis=\"1\"> \\relative c' { \\clef treble \\numericTimeSignature \\time 4/4 \\key d \\major \\partial 4*1 a4\\pp( | d2 cis4 b) | a( b cis d) | e2( fis4 e) | e2( d4) } </score>\n\nIn his Fifth Symphony, the first version of which was composed 1901–1902, Gustav Mahler included a chorale near the end of Part I (2nd movement). The chorale melody reappears in a transformed version in the last movement of the symphony (Part III, 5th movement). Shortly after Mahler had completed the symphony, his wife Alma reproached him to have included a dreary church-like chorale in the work. Mahler replied that Bruckner had included chorales in his symphonies, to which she replied \"\"Der\" darf, du nicht!\" (\"He\" [Bruckner] can do that, you shouldn't). In her memoir, she continues that she then tried to convince her husband that his strength lay elsewhere than in the adoption of churchy chorales in his music.\n\nBusoni continued to compose Bach-inspired chorales in the 20th century, for instance including chorale subsections in his \"Fantasia contrappuntistica\" (1910s). \"Sports et divertissements\", written by Erik Satie in 1914, opens with \"Choral inappétissant\" (unsavoury chorale), in which the composer put, according to his preface, everything he knew about tedium, and which he dedicated to all who disliked him. As with much of Satie's music, it was written down without metre.\n\nIgor Stravinsky included chorales in some of his compositions: among others, a \"Little Chorale\" and a \"Great Chorale\" in his \"L'Histoire du soldat\" (1918) and a chorale concluding his \"Symphonies of Wind Instruments\" (1920, rev. 1947). Chorales appear in Olivier Messiaen's music, for instance in \"\" (1986–1988) and \"La ville d'en haut\" (1989), two late .\n\nStand-alone orchestral chorales were adapted from works by Johann Sebastian Bach: for instance Leopold Stokowski orchestrated, among other similar pieces, the sacred song BWV 478 and the fourth movement of the cantata BWV 4 as chorales \"Komm, süsser Tod\" (recorded 1933) and \"Jesus Christus, Gottes Sohn\" (recorded 1937) respectively. Recordings of all of Bach's chorales—vocal as well as instrumental—appeared in the three complete works box sets that were issued around the 250th anniversary of the composer's death in 2000.\n\nChorale melodies are often in Bar form, that is, consisting of a repeated first phrase, called , and a concluding second phrase. The harmonisation of such a chorale melody may repeat the same harmonisation for both passes of the , or may present a variant harmonisation on the second pass of the first phrase of the melody.\n\nHymnals:\n\nCollections, e.g. Bach's four-part chorale editions\n\n\"Colla parte\" accompaniment, e.g. closing chorales of Bach-cantatas\n\nChorale fantasia, e.g. opening movement of \"St Matthew Passion\" (in English rather called Chorus than Chorale)\n\nVoice and continuo, e.g. \"Schemellis Gesangbuch\" (1736) – rather called \"Lied\" in German\n\nIn instrumental chorale settings, as well emulations of four-part homophony, as chorale fantasia type of approaches exist.\n\nOriginally \"Choralbearbeitung\", i.e. setting of a pre-existing chorale melody\n\nChorale preludes, e.g. \"Erster Theil etlicher Choräle\" (Pachelbel), \"Clavier-Übung III\" (Bach)\n\nNot based on pre-existing hymn tunes, e.g. César Franck's \"Trois chorals\"\n\nIn symphonies, e.g. Mendelssohn, Saint-Saëns, Mahler\n\nChorales for solo piano are included in, for instance, Franck's \"Prélude, Choral et Fugue\" (1884), Satie's \"Sports et divertissements\" (1914, published ), and Busoni's \"Fantasia contrappuntistica\" (multiple versions, early 1910s). That last composition also exists in the composer's arrangement for two pianos (early 1920s).\n\n\n\n"}

CDI created a 21-minute format to encourage debate. Daniel Dennett called it the \"brain Olympics\".\n\nCDI speakers have included Nobel Prize winners Jerome Isaac Friedman, Mario J. Molina, Jody Williams, Daniel Kahneman and Paul Krugman; researchers Robert Sapolsky, Steven Pinker, Eduard Punset, Clotaire Rapaille, Tim Berners-Lee, David Buss, Richard Dawkins, Michael Shermer, Craig Venter and Randi Zuckerberg; and Oscar nominees Adame Pesapane (PES) and Oliver Stone.\n\nSince 2008, up to 3,600 attendees have gathered every November in the center of Puebla.\n\nThe head and curator of CDI is Andrés Roemer, partner of the NGO Poder Civico A.C., together with Ricardo Salinas Pliego, President and CEO of Grupo Salinas. The thematic approach of the curator of the speakers is as follows: \"Scholars/Policy and Makers\" (leading academics and public policy makers), \"Mex-I-Can\" (talented Mexicans), \"W-Under18\" (children and young people), Debates, Art, Emotional, Technology, Artistic Interventions, and Entertainment.\n\nThe festival has been promoted in Azteca Trece and Proyecto 40 and on the event's website, social media, and through a science bookstore located at the festival site.\n\nSince June 9, 2008, over 231 festival speakers have had their presentations published online. Fifty percent of the audience are between 16 and 25 years old.\n\nThe first conference took place in Puebla’s Convention Center in 2008. Its name is derived from the star Polaris, also named \"Cynosura\" by the Greeks, pertaining to the Ursa Minor constellation. \"Cynosura\" took place from the 6th to 8 November, with the speakers allotted 21 minutes to present. The conference commemorated the 100-year anniversary of the scandal caused by the String Quartet No.2 in F Sharp Minor by Austrian composter, Arnold Schoenberg, with the atonality that disrupted traditional classic music.\n\nFrom 2009 onwards, the University’s Cultural Complex of the Meritorious Autonomous University of Puebla became the International Brilliant Minds Festival’s official venue. La Ciudad de las Ideas celebrated the International Year of Astronomy with a \"night of telescopes\" and, from 2009 to 2012, innovative ideas in science and humanities were acknowledged with the \"Innovation for Humanity\" Prize and the \"Entrepreneur for Humanity\" Prize.\n\nThe winners of the \"Innovation for Humanity\" Prize in 2008 were Daniel Dennett and Steven Pinker, while the \"Entrepreneur for Humanity\" Prize acknowledged nearly 300 individuals.\n\nIn 2010, CDI commemorated two historical events relevant to Mexico: the Bicentennial Independence Day Anniversary and the Centennial Anniversary of the Mexican Revolution. The 2010 edition took place in the University Cultural Complex at the Meritorious Autonomous University of Puebla from the 11th to 13 November, where over 33 speakers attended.\n\nThe winners of the \"Innovation for Humanity\" Prize in 2009 were Dan Ariely and Philip Zimbardo, and the \"Entrepreneur for Humanity\" Prize acknowledged 200 individuals.\n\nThis edition of CDI took place from the 10th to 12 November 2011 in the University Cultural Complex at the Meritorious Autonomous University of Puebla. As in 2009, the \"night of telescopes\" took place on Friday the 11th at 7pm.\n\nThe winners of the \"Innovation for Humanity\" Prize in 2010 were Michio Kaku and Richard Dawkins. The \"Entrepreneur for Humanity\" Prize was awarded to 120 individuals.\n\nThe fifth edition of the festival was titled \"The Magic of If\". This edition took place from the 8th to 10 November 2012 in the University Cultural Complex at the Meritorious Autonomous University of Puebla. It included a new section dedicated to Mexican talent, called \"Mex-I-can\" and, on the other hand, the time for speakers to present reduced from 21 to 12 minutes.\n\nThe winners of the Innovation for Humanity Prize in 2011 were Eduard Punset, Oliver Stone and Dambisa Moyo. For the 2012 edition, the \"Entrepreneur for Humanity\" Prize was transformed into a prize with great reach and significance, turning into an initiative that stimulates social entrepreneurship projects, called \"Gifted Citizen Prize\".\n\nThe festival's sixth edition took place from 7 to 9 November 2013, with the title of \"Dangerous Ideas\". Ciudad de las Ideas 2013 also took place in the University Cultural Complex at the Meritorious Autonomous University of Puebla and includes a new curatorial topic, \"W-Under 18\" that invited children and youth that are changing the world, like Jack Andraka, Boyan Slat, and Umi Garrett.\n\nThis initiative began at La Ciudad de las Ideas 2012. Submitted projects are evaluated by a committee and the conference Board of Directors. The projects can be scientific, technological, social, ecological or artistic in nature, as well as concerning development or human rights. The most outstanding project is awarded US$100,000. This prize is given in association with the Singularity University.

{"id": "32891631", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32891631", "title": "Country Party (Britain)", "text": "Country Party (Britain)\n\nIn Britain in the era 1680–1740, especially in the days of Robert Walpole (1720s to 1740s), the country Party was a coalition of Tories and disaffected Whigs. It was a movement rather than an organised party and had no formal structure or leaders. It claimed to be a nonpartisan force fighting for the nation's interest—the whole \"country\"—against the self-interested actions of the court party, that is the politicians in power in London. Country men believed the court party was corrupting Britain by using patronage to buy support and was threatening English and Scottish liberties and the proper balance of authority by shifting power from Parliament to the prime minister. It sought to constrain the court by opposing standing armies, calling for annual elections to Parliament (instead of the seven-year term in effect), and wanted to fix power in the hands of the landed gentry rather than the royal officials, urban merchants or bankers. It opposed any practices it saw as corruption.\n\nThe Country Party attracted a number of influential writers (such as Jonathan Swift, Samuel Johnson, and Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun) and political theorists. The ideology of the party faded away in England but became a powerful force in the American colonies, where its tracts strongly motivated the Patriots to oppose what the country party had cast as British monarchical tyranny and to develop a powerful political philosophy of republicanism in the United States.\n\nHistorically, the name \"country party\" was used by what became the Whig Party itself in its initial stages, when headed by the Earl of Shaftesbury during the Exclusion Crisis of 1679-1681. Then, the term \"whiggamor\", shortened to \"Whig\", started being applied to the party - first as a pejorative term, then adopted and taken up by the party itself. The name \"country party\" was thus discarded - to be taken up later by opponents of the Whig Party itself, once it had come to dominate British politics following the Glorious Revolution. \n\nThe historian Hoppit has interpreted that around 1700 instead of a country \"party\", the English electorate, its Lords and its elected representatives had a country persuasion with key consensus demands that the government should be frugal and efficient, opposition to high taxes, a concern for personal liberty, a quest for more frequent elections, a faith that the local militia would substitute for a dangerous standing army, a desire for such moral reforms as temperance in an age of drunkenness, and less Sabbath breaking. The country leaders stressed the civic duty of the upper class to engage in politics to strengthen the national interest. Such views amount to the main counter to extreme High Tory hegemony and the similar bigwig Whig Party cabal which in its estimation morphed via other executives into the Walpole executive placemen.\n\nHenry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke was especially influential in stating the need and outlining the machinery of a systematic parliamentary opposition. Such an opposition he called a \"country party\" which he opposed to the court party. Country parties had been formed before, for instance after the king's speech to Parliament in November 1685, but Bolingbroke was the first to state the need for a continual opposition to the government. To his mind the spirit of liberty was threatened by the court party's lust for power.\n\nLiberty could only be safeguarded by an opposition party that used \"constitutional methods and a legal course of opposition to the excesses of legal and ministerial power…\". He instructed the opposition party to \"Wrest the power of government, if you can, out of the hands that employed it weakly and wickedly\" This work could be done only by a homogeneous party \"…because such a party alone will submit to a drudgery of this kind\". It did not suffice to be eager to speak, keen to act. \"They who affect to head an opposition, …, must be equal, at least, to those whom they oppose…\". The opposition had to be of a permanent nature to make sure that it would be looked at as a part of daily politics. It had to contrast, on every occasion, the government. He considered a party that systematically opposed the government to be more appealing than a party that occasionally opposed the government. This opposition had to prepare itself to control government.\n\nThe writings of the country party were eagerly devoured by some American colonists who came to fear the corruption of the English court as the greatest threat to the colonies’ desired liberties. They formed a Patriot cause in the Thirteen Colonies and used the country party ideas to help form Republicanism in the United States. Hutson identified country ideology as a major influence on the Antifederalists during the debate over the ratification of the United States Constitution. Similarly, Jeffersonianism inherited the country party attack on elitism, centralization, and distant government during the ascent of Alexander Hamilton and other Federalists.\n\n\n"}

Upon arriving at the ball, her fiancé discovers that she has frozen to death during the journey.\n\nThe ballad of \"Fair Charlotte\" is based on a poem by Seba Smith that was first published in \"The Rover\", a Maine newspaper, on December 28, 1843, under the title \"A Corpse Going To A Ball\". According to folklorist Phillips Barry, Smith's composition was based on an incident recounted in an 1840 \"New York Observer\" article of the same name.. The story from the \"New York Observer\" was entitled \"A Corpse Going To a Ball\" and was reprinted in an Ohio Newspaper: \"Ohio Democrat and Dover Advertiser\" February 28, 1840 p. 1the article claimed that the incident in question had happened on January 1, 1840; it also claimed that this report was true [yet gave \"no location of the accident\"]; likewise it also mentioned at the very beginning a tale called \"Death at the Toilet\" which in turn came from a 1838 work called \"Passages from the Diary of a London Physician\".The \"Death at the Toilet\" told of a vain young woman who was determined to go a ball despite the fact that she suffers from heart problems; because of Cold weather in her room she is found dead at her toilet while primping herself for the ball; the morale of the story is a diatribe against vanity-\"...I have seen many hundreds of corpses, as well in the calm composure of natural death, as mangled and distorted by violence;but never have I seen so startling a satire upon human vanity, so repulsive, unsightly, and loathsome a spectacle as \"a corpse dressed for a ball\"!.\" Other Newspapers which reprinted the story were the \"Vermont Telegraph\" {February 19, 1840 and a follow up article April 1, 1840} and \"Southern Argus\" March 3, 1840 of Columbus Mississippi. A version of Smith's poem was subsequently set to music, leading to the creation of the ballad.\nDuring the 20th century, a version of the ballad was sung by Almeda Riddle under the title \"Young Carlotta\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "190485", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=190485", "title": "Feng shui", "text": "Feng shui\n\nFeng shui or fengshui (, ), also known as Chinese geomancy, is a pseudoscience originating from China, which claims to use energy forces to harmonize individuals with their surrounding environment. The term \"feng shui\" literally translates as \"wind-water\" in English. This is a cultural shorthand taken from the passage of the now-lost \"Classic of Burial\" recorded in Guo Pu's commentary:\nFeng shui is one of the Five Arts of Chinese Metaphysics, classified as physiognomy (observation of appearances through formulas and calculations). The feng shui practice discusses architecture in terms of \"invisible forces\" that bind the universe, earth, and humanity together, known as \"qi\".\n\nHistorically, feng shui was widely used to orient buildings—often spiritually significant structures such as tombs, but also dwellings and other structures—in an auspicious manner. Depending on the particular style of feng shui being used, an auspicious site could be determined by reference to local features such as bodies of water, or stars or the compass.\n\n the Yangshao and Hongshan cultures provide the earliest known evidence for the use of feng shui. Until the invention of the magnetic compass, feng shui apparently relied on astronomy to find correlations between humans and the universe.\nIn 4000 BC, the doors of Banpo dwellings aligned with the asterism \"Yingshi\" just after the winter solstice—this sited the homes for solar gain. During the Zhou era, \"Yingshi\" was known as \"Ding\" and used to indicate the appropriate time to build a capital city, according to the \"Shijing\". The late Yangshao site at Dadiwan (c. 3500–3000 BC) includes a palace-like building (F901) at the center. The building faces south and borders a large plaza. It stands on a north-south axis with another building that apparently housed communal activities. Regional communities may have used the complex.\n\nA grave at Puyang (around 4000 BC) that contains mosaics— actually a Chinese star map of the Dragon and Tiger asterisms and Beidou (the Big Dipper, Ladle or Bushel)— is oriented along a north-south axis. The presence of both round and square shapes in the Puyang tomb, at Hongshan ceremonial centers and at the late Longshan settlement at Lutaigang,\nsuggests that \"gaitian\" cosmography (heaven-round, earth-square) existed in Chinese society long before it appeared in the \"Zhoubi Suanjing\".\n\nCosmography that bears a striking resemblance to modern feng shui devices and formulas appears on a piece of jade unearthed at Hanshan and dated around 3000 BC. Archaeologist Li Xueqin links the design to the \"liuren\" astrolabe, \"zhinan zhen\", and luopan.\n\nBeginning with palatial structures at Erlitou,\nall capital cities of China followed rules of feng shui for their design and layout. During the Zhou era, the \"Kaogong ji\" (; \"Manual of Crafts\") codified these rules. The carpenter's manual \"Lu ban jing\" (; \"Lu ban's manuscript\") codified rules for builders. Graves and tombs also followed rules of feng shui, from Puyang to Mawangdui and beyond. From the earliest records, the structures of the graves and dwellings seem to have followed the same rules.\n\nThe history of feng shui covers 3,500+ years before the invention of the magnetic compass. It originated in Chinese astronomy. Some current techniques can be traced to Neolithic China, while others were added later (most notably the Han dynasty, the Tang, the Song, and the Ming).\n\nThe astronomical history of feng shui is evident in the development of instruments and techniques. According to the \"Zhouli\", the original feng shui instrument may have been a \"gnomon\". Chinese used circumpolar stars to determine the north-south axis of settlements. This technique explains why Shang palaces at Xiaotun lie 10° east of due north. In some of the cases, as Paul Wheatley observed, they bisected the angle between the directions of the rising and setting sun to find north. This technique provided the more precise alignments of the Shang walls at Yanshi and Zhengzhou. Rituals for using a feng shui instrument required a diviner to examine current sky phenomena to set the device and adjust their position in relation to the device.\n\nThe oldest examples of instruments used for feng shui are \"liuren\" astrolabes, also known as \"shi\". These consist of a lacquered, two-sided board with astronomical sightlines. The earliest examples of liuren astrolabes have been unearthed from tombs that date between 278 BC and 209 BC. Along with divination for Da Liu Ren the boards were commonly used to chart the motion of Taiyi through the nine palaces. The markings on a \"liuren/shi\" and the first magnetic compasses are virtually identical.\n\nThe magnetic compass was invented for feng shui and has been in use since its invention. Traditional feng shui instrumentation consists of the Luopan or the earlier south-pointing spoon (指南針 \"zhinan zhen\")—though a conventional compass could suffice if one understood the differences. A feng shui ruler (a later invention) may also be employed.\n\nThe goal of feng shui as practiced today is to situate the human-built environment on spots with good \"qi\", an imagined form of \"energy\". The \"perfect spot\" is a location and an axis in time.\n\nFeng shui is not a science, but is classified as a pseudoscience since it exhibits a number of classic pseudoscientific aspects such as making claims about the functioning of the world which are not amenable to testing with the scientific method.\n\n\"Qi\"（氣）(pronounced \"chee\" in English) is a movable positive or negative life force which plays an essential role in feng shui. In feng shui as in Chinese martial arts, it refers to 'energy', in the sense of 'life force' or \"élan vital\". A traditional explanation of \"qi\" as it relates to feng shui would include the orientation of a structure, its age, and its interaction with the surrounding environment, including the local microclimates, the slope of the land, vegetation, and soil quality.\n\nThe \"Book of Burial\" says that burial takes advantage of \"vital\" qi\"\". Wu Yuanyin (Qing dynasty) said that vital \"qi\" was \"congealed \"qi\"\", which is the state of \"qi\" that engenders life. The goal of feng shui is to take advantage of vital\" qi\" by appropriate siting of graves and structures. Some people destroyed graveyards of their enemies to weaken their qi.\n\nOne use for a \"loupan\" is to detect the flow of \"qi\". Magnetic compasses reflect local geomagnetism which includes geomagnetically induced currents caused by space weather. Professor Max Knoll suggested in a 1951 lecture that qi is a form of solar radiation. As space weather changes over time, and the quality of\" qi\" rises and falls over time, feng shui with a compass might be considered a form of divination that assesses the quality of the local environment—including the effects of space weather. Often people with good karma live in land with good qi.\n\nPolarity is expressed in feng shui as \"yin\" and \"yang\" theory. Polarity expressed through \"yin\" and \"yang\" is similar to a magnetic dipole. That is, it is of two parts: one creating an exertion and one receiving the exertion. \"Yang\" acting and \"yin\" receiving could be considered an early understanding of chirality. The development of this theory and its corollary, five phase theory (five element theory), have also been linked with astronomical observations of sunspots.\n\nThe Five Elements or Forces (\"wu xing\") – which, according to the Chinese, are metal, earth, fire, water, and wood – are first mentioned in Chinese literature in a chapter of the classic \"Book of History\". They play a very important part in Chinese thought: ‘elements’ meaning generally not so much the actual substances as the forces essential to human life. Earth is a buffer, or an equilibrium achieved when the polarities cancel each other. While the goal of Chinese medicine is to balance yin and yang in the body, the goal of feng shui has been described as aligning a city, site, building, or object with yin-yang force fields.\n\nEight diagrams known as \"bagua\" (or \"pa kua\") loom large in feng shui, and both predate their mentions in the \"Yijing\" (or \"I Ching\"). The \"Lo (River) Chart\" (\"Luoshu\") was developed first, and is sometimes associated with \"Later Heaven\" arrangement of the bagua. This and the \"Yellow River Chart\" (\"Hetu\", sometimes associated with the \"Earlier Heaven bagua\") are linked to astronomical events of the sixth millennium BC, and with the Turtle Calendar from the time of Yao. The Turtle Calendar of Yao (found in the \"Yaodian\" section of the \"Shangshu\" or \"Book of Documents\") dates to 2300 BC, plus or minus 250 years.\n\nIn \"Yaodian\", the cardinal directions are determined by the marker-stars of the mega-constellations known as the Four Celestial Animals:\n\n\nThe diagrams are also linked with the \"sifang\" (four directions) method of divination used during the Shang dynasty. The \"sifang\" is much older, however. It was used at Niuheliang, and figured large in Hongshan culture's astronomy. And it is this area of China that is linked to Yellow Emperor (Huangdi) who allegedly invented the south-pointing spoon (see compass).\n\nTraditional feng shui is an ancient system based upon the observation of heavenly time and earthly space. The literature of ancient China, as well as archaeological evidence, provide some idea of the origins and nature of the original feng shui techniques.\n\nThe Form School is the oldest school of feng shui. Qing Wuzi in the Han dynasty describes it in the \"Book of the Tomb\" and Guo Pu of the Jin dynasty follows up with a more complete description in \"The Book of Burial\".\n\nThe Form School was originally concerned with the location and orientation of tombs (Yin House feng shui), which was of great importance. The school then progressed to the consideration of homes and other buildings (Yang House feng shui).\n\nThe \"form\" in Form School refers to the shape of the environment, such as mountains, rivers, plateaus, buildings, and general surroundings. It considers the five celestial animals (phoenix, green dragon, white tiger, black turtle, and the yellow snake), the yin-yang concept and the traditional five elements (Wu Xing: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water).\n\nThe Form School analyses the shape of the land and flow of the wind and water to find a place with ideal qi. It also considers the time of important events such as the birth of the resident and the building of the structure.\n\nThe Compass School is a collection of more recent feng shui techniques based on the eight cardinal directions, each of which is said to have unique qi. It uses the Luopan, a disc marked with formulas in concentric rings around a magnetic compass.\n\nThe Compass School includes techniques such as Flying Star and Eight Mansions.\n\nAside from the books written throughout history by feng shui masters and students, there is also a strong oral history. In many cases, masters have passed on their techniques only to selected students or relatives.\n\nThere is no contemporary agreement that one of the traditional schools is most correct. Therefore, modern practitioners of feng shui generally draw from multiple schools in their own practices.\n\nMore recent forms of feng shui simplify principles that come from the traditional schools, and focus mainly on the use of the bagua.\n\nThe Eight Life Aspirations style of feng shui is a simple system which coordinates each of the eight cardinal directions with a specific life aspiration or station such as family, wealth, fame, etc., which come from the Bagua government of the eight aspirations. Life Aspirations is not otherwise a geomantic system.\n\n\nSan Yuan Method, 三元派 (Pinyin: sān yuán pài)\nSan He Method, 三合派 (environmental analysis using a compass)\n\nOthers\n\n\nTraditional feng shui relies upon the compass to give accurate readings. However, critics point out that the compass degrees are often inaccurate as fluctuations caused by solar winds have the ability to greatly disturb the electromagnetic field of the earth. Determining a property or site location based upon Magnetic North will result in inaccuracies because true magnetic north fluctuates.\n\nMatteo Ricci (1552–1610), one of the founding fathers of Jesuit China missions, may have been the first European to write about feng shui practices. His account in \"De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas...\" tells about feng shui masters (\"geologi\", in Latin) studying prospective construction sites or grave sites \"with reference to the head and the tail and the feet of the particular dragons which are supposed to dwell beneath that spot\". As a Catholic missionary, Ricci strongly criticized the \"recondite science\" of geomancy along with astrology as yet another \"superstitio absurdissima\" of the heathens: \"What could be more absurd than their imagining that the safety of a family, honors, and their entire existence must depend upon such trifles as a door being opened from one side or another, as rain falling into a courtyard from the right or from the left, a window opened here or there, or one roof being higher than another?\".\n\nVictorian-era commentators on feng shui were generally ethnocentric, and as such skeptical and derogatory of what they knew of feng shui. In 1896, at a meeting of the Educational Association of China, Rev. P.W. Pitcher railed at the \"rottenness of the whole scheme of Chinese architecture,\" and urged fellow missionaries \"to erect unabashedly Western edifices of several stories and with towering spires in order to destroy nonsense about \"fung-shuy\"\".\nAfter the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, feng shui was officially considered a \"feudalistic superstitious practice\" and a \"social evil\" according to the state's ideology and was discouraged and even banned outright at times. Feng shui remained popular in Hong Kong, and also in the Republic of China (Taiwan), where traditional culture was not suppressed.\n\nPersecution was the most severe during the Cultural Revolution, when feng shui was classified as a custom under the so-called Four Olds to be wiped out. Feng shui practitioners were beaten and abused by Red Guards and their works burned. After the death of Mao Zedong and the end of the Cultural Revolution, the official attitude became more tolerant but restrictions on feng shui practice are still in place in today's China. It is illegal in the PRC today to register feng shui consultation as a business and similarly advertising feng shui practice is banned. There have been frequent crackdowns on feng shui practitioners on the grounds of \"promoting feudalistic superstitions\" such as one in Qingdao in early 2006 when the city's business and industrial administration office shut down an art gallery converted into a feng shui practice. Some communist officials who had previously consulted feng shui were terminated and expelled from the Communist Party.\n\nPartly because of the Cultural Revolution, in today's mainland China less than one-third of the population believe in feng shui, and the proportion of believers among young urban Chinese is said to be much lower Learning feng shui is still somewhat considered taboo in today's China. Nevertheless, it is reported that feng shui has gained adherents among Communist Party officials according to a BBC Chinese news commentary in 2006, and since the beginning of Chinese economic reforms the number of feng shui practitioners is increasing. A number of Chinese academics permitted to research on the subject of feng shui are anthropologists or architects by profession, studying the history of feng shui or historical feng shui theories behind the design of heritage buildings, such as Cao Dafeng, the Vice-President of Fudan University, and Liu Shenghuan of Tongji University.\n\nWesterners were criticized at the start of the anti-Western Boxer Rebellion for violating the basic principles of feng shui in the construction of railroads and other conspicuous public structures throughout China. However, today, feng shui is practiced not only by the Chinese, but also by Westerners and still criticized by Christians around the world. Many modern Christians have an opinion of feng shui similar to that of their predecessors:\n\nIt is entirely inconsistent with Christianity to believe that harmony and balance result from the manipulation and channeling of nonphysical forces or energies, or that such can be done by means of the proper placement of physical objects. Such techniques, in fact, belong to the world of sorcery.\n\nStill others are simply skeptical of feng shui. Evidence for its effectiveness is based primarily upon anecdote and users are often offered conflicting advice from different practitioners. Feng shui practitioners use these differences as evidence of variations in practice or different schools of thought. Critical analysts have described it thus: \"Feng shui has always been based upon mere guesswork\". Some are skeptical of feng shui's lasting impact. Mark Johnson:\n\nThis present state of affairs is ludicrous and confusing. Do we really believe that mirrors and flutes are going to change people's tendencies in any lasting and meaningful way? ... There is a lot of investigation that needs to be done or we will all go down the tubes because of our inability to match our exaggerated claims with lasting changes.\n\nNonetheless, after Richard Nixon journeyed to the People's Republic of China in 1972, feng shui became marketable in the United States and has since been reinvented by New Age entrepreneurs for Western consumption. Critics of contemporary feng shui are concerned that with the passage of time much of the theory behind it has been lost in translation, not paid proper consideration, frowned upon, or even scorned. Robert T. Carroll sums up what feng shui has become in some instances:\n\n...feng shui has become an aspect of interior decorating in the Western world and alleged masters of feng shui now hire themselves out for hefty sums to tell people such as Donald Trump which way his doors and other things should hang. Feng shui has also become another New Age \"energy\" scam with arrays of metaphysical products...offered for sale to help you improve your health, maximize your potential, and guarantee fulfillment of some fortune cookie philosophy.\n\nOthers have noted how, when feng shui is not applied properly, it can even harm the environment, such as was the case of people planting \"lucky bamboo\" in ecosystems that could not handle them.\n\nFeng shui practitioners in China find superstitious and corrupt officials easy prey, despite official disapproval. In one instance, in 2009, county officials in Gansu, on the advice of feng shui practitioners, spent $732,000 to haul a 369-ton \"spirit rock\" to the county seat to ward off \"bad luck.\"\n\nThe stage magician duo Penn and Teller dedicated an episode of their \"\" television show to criticise the construal of contemporary practice of Feng Shui in the Western World as science. In this episode, they devised a test in which the same dwelling was visited by five different Feng Shui consultants, all five producing different opinions about said dwelling, by which means it was attempted to show there is no consistency in the professional practice of Feng Shui.\n\nMany Asians, especially people of Chinese descent, believe it is important to live a prosperous and healthy life as evident by the popularity of Fu Lu Shou in the Chinese communities. Many of the higher-level forms of feng shui are not easily practiced without having connections in the community or a certain amount of wealth because hiring an expert, altering architecture or design, and moving from place to place requires a significant financial outlay. This leads some people of the lower classes to lose faith in feng shui, saying that it is only a game for the wealthy. Others, however, practice less expensive forms of feng shui, including hanging special (but cheap) mirrors, forks, or woks in doorways to deflect negative energy.\n\nIn recent years, a new brand of easier-to-implement DIY Feng Shui known as \"Symbolic Feng Shui\", which is popularized by best-selling author Lillian Too, is being practised by Feng Shui enthusiasts. It entails placements of auspicious (and preferably aesthetically pleasing) Five Element objects, such as \"Money God\" and \"tortoise\", at various locations of the house so as to achieve a pleasing and substitute-alternative \"Productive-Cycle\" environment if a good natural environment is not already present or is too expensive to build and implement.\n\nFeng shui is so important to some strong believers, that they use it for healing purposes (although there is no empirical evidence that this practice is in any way effective) in addition to guide their businesses and create a peaceful atmosphere in their homes, in particular in the bedroom where a number of techniques involving colours and arrangement are used to achieve enhanced comfort and more peaceful sleep. In 2005, even Disney acknowledged feng shui as an important part of Chinese culture by shifting the main gate to Hong Kong Disneyland by twelve degrees in their building plans, among many other actions suggested by the master planner of architecture and design at Walt Disney Imagineering, Wing Chao, in an effort to incorporate local culture into the theme park.\n\nAt Singapore Polytechnic and other institutions, many working professionals from various disciplines (including engineers, architects, property agents and interior designers) take courses on feng shui and divination every year with a number of them becoming part-time or full-time feng shui (or geomancy) consultants eventually.\n\n"}

The paintings consist of four separate scenes depicting morning, midday, evening and night, a series created by several artists of the era including Vernet and Philip James de Loutherbourg.\n\nClaude Joseph Vernet was considered the leading French artist of his time in his genre, marine art and landscape painting. He came from a family of French painters: he was the son of a decorative painter, and his son Antoine-Charles-Horace Vernet, Carle Vernet (1758–1836), and his grandson Horace Vernet (1789–1863) were known as military painters. Vernet lived in Italy for 20 years, 1734 to 1753, where he had an atelier in Rome. His style was influenced by the Italian 17th-century painters Claude Lorrain and Salvator Rosa. His landscapes and especially seascapes were celebrated for their romantic qualities. Upon his return to France, a series of marine paintings were commissioned from him around 1753 by the French king Louis XV. This was to depict a series of seaports, of which 15 paintings were executed. The project lasted for about 10 years, and until 1765 he traveled around France painting seascapes, eventually abandoning the project unfinished.\n\nIn the series of four paintings, the first depiction is entitled \"Morning\". The painting shows a misty morning scene with fishermen with their boat. The second, entitled \"Midday\" depicts a sudden, unexpected storm. The painting \"Evening\" shows women bathing and washing their clothes. The final scene shows a rocky inlet, with fishermen drying their nets while others are gathered round a fire. The scenes depicted in the paintings were Vernet's favourite scenes that he painted in different settings throughout his career.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1025265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1025265", "title": "Gender of connectors and fasteners", "text": "Gender of connectors and fasteners\n\nIn electrical and mechanical trades and manufacturing, each half of a pair of mating connectors or fasteners is conventionally assigned the designation male or female. The \"female\" connector is generally a receptacle that receives and holds the \"male\" connector. On occasion, the terms \"male\" and \"female\" are respectively referred to as the A and B ends, though the names of some standards conflict with this as they contain the letters A or B within the name; unambiguous, though rare, terms include plug and socket or jack.\n\nThe assignment is a direct analogy with genitalia and heterosexual sex; the part bearing one or more protrusions, or which fits inside the other, being designated male in contrast to the part containing the corresponding indentations, or fitting outside the other, being designated female. Extension of the analogy results in the verb to mate being used to describe the process of connecting two corresponding parts together. \n\nIn some cases (notably electrical power connectors), the gender of connectors is selected according to rigid rules, to enforce a sense of one-way directionality (e.g. a flow of power \"from\" one device \"to\" another). This gender distinction is implemented to enhance safety or ensure proper functionality by preventing unsafe or non-functional configurations from being set up.\n\nIn terms of mathematical graph theory, an electrical power distribution network made up of plugs and sockets is a directed tree, with the directionality arrows corresponding to the female-to-male transfer of electrical power through each mated connection. This is an example where male and female connectors have been deliberately designed and assigned to physically enforce a safe network topology.\n\nIn other contexts, such as plumbing, one-way flow is \"not\" enforced through connector gender assignment. Flows through piping networks can be bidirectional, as in underground water distribution networks which have designed-in redundancy. In plumbing situations where one-way flow \"is\" desired, it is implemented through other means (e.g. gravity flow, one-way check valves), and not through male-female gender schemes.\n\nIn mechanical design, the prototypical \"male\" component is a threaded bolt, but an alignment post, a mounting boss, or a sheet metal tab connector can also be considered as male. Correspondingly, a threaded nut, an alignment hole, a mounting recess, or sheet metal slot connector is considered to be female.\n\nWhile some mechanical designs are \"one-off\" custom setups not intended to be repeated, there is an entire fastener industry devoted to manufacturing mass-produced or semi-custom components. To avoid unnecessary confusion, conventional definitions of fastener gender have been defined and agreed upon.\n\nAlthough this aspect is not highlighted in their promotional literature, several common construction toys embody gendered (and in some cases, genderless) mechanical interconnections. This should not be surprising, since these toys feature the nearly infinite flexibility and versatility of shape that a modular interconnect architecture can enable. Mathematicians have begun to classify well-known construction sets using group theory to study the combinatoric possibilities of structures that can be built.\n\nFor example, the canonical LEGO plastic blocks have \"female\" indentations on the lower surface, and \"male\" bosses or protrusions on the upper surfaces. Meccano and Erector have many gendered connections, starting with the nut-and-bolt fasteners they use frequently.\n\nStickle bricks, using interlocking plastic protrusions, are effectively genderless. Lincoln logs use a very simple form of genderless connections. Kapla or KEVA planks are extremely simple genderless systems interconnected only by gravity.\n\nIn plumbing fittings, the \"M\" or \"F\" usually comes at the beginning rather than the end of the abbreviated designation. For example:\n\nA short length of pipe having an MIP thread at both ends is sometimes called a nipple. A short pipe fitting having an FIP thread at both ends is sometimes called a coupling.\n\nHermaphroditic connections, which include both male and female elements in a single unit, are used for some specialized tubing fittings, such as Storz fire hose connectors. A picture of such fittings appears in the \n\nDownspouts (downpipes, rain conductors or leaders) are used to convey rainwater from roof gutters to the ground through hollow pipes or tubes. These tubes usually come in sections, joined by inserting the male end (often crimped with a special tool to slightly reduce its size) into the female end of the next section. These connections are usually not sealed or caulked, instead relying on gravity to move the rainwater from the male end and into the receiving female connection located directly below.\n\nSheet metal ductwork for conveying air in HVAC systems typically uses gendered connections. Typically, the airflow through a ductwork connection is from male to female. However, since one-way flow is implemented by forced-air fans or blowers, \"backwards\" gendered connections can be seen frequently in some systems, since all connections are typically sealed with duct sealing mastic or tape to prevent leakage anyway. The flow convention is usually loosely adhered to for simplicity of design, and to reduce the number of gender changer fittings required, but exceptions are made whenever expedient.\n\nAlthough the gender of tubing and plumbing fittings is usually obvious, this may not be true of electrical connectors because of their more complex and varying constructions. Instead, connector gender is conventionalized and thus can be somewhat obscure to the uninitiated. For example, the female D-subminiature connector body projects outward from the mounting plane of the chassis, and this protrusion could be erroneously construed as male. Instead, the \"maleness\" of the D-subminiature connectors is defined by specific presence of \"male pins\", rather than by the protrusion of the connector, which is also true for many other pin-based connectors like XLR. The male/female distinction is more obvious with ring crimp lug connectors which are placed around a screw post, but again with spade or split ring crimp lug connectors the end alone is not obviously female.\n\nFurther confusion can be caused by the term \"jack\", which is used for both female and male connectors and typically refers to the fixed (panel) side of a connector pair. IEEE STD 100, IEEE-315-1975 and IEEE 200-1975 (replaced by ASME Y14.44-2008) define \"Plug\" and \"Jack\" by location or mobility, rather than gender.\n\nA connector in a fixed location is a jack and a moveable connector is a plug. The distinction is relative, so a portable radio is considered stationary compared to the cable from the headphones; the radio has a jack, and the headphone cable has a plug. Where the relationship is equal, such as when two flexible cables are connected, each is considered a plug. Jacks use the reference designator prefix of J and plugs use the reference designator prefix of P. It is possible in the case of box mounted connectors for the connector to be a receptacle with male pin contacts. In this case the connector is designated a jack (J ref des) regardless of the contact gender because the housing for the contacts is in fact configured as the receptacle even though its mate (the plug) goes around the receptacle. See MIL-STD-38999 and similar cases.\n\nIt is common practice to use female connectors for jacks, so the informal gender-based usage often happens to agree with the functional description of the technical standards. However, this is \"not\" always the case; often-seen exceptions include a computer's AC Power Inlet and EIA232 DE9 Serial Port, or the male coaxial power jacks for connecting external power adapters to portable equipment.\n\nTo summarize, it is considered best practice to use \"male\" and \"female\" for connector \"gender\", and \"plug\" and \"jack\" for connector \"function\" or \"mobility\".\n\nIn the UK, many Commonwealth countries and some non-English-speaking countries, the word \"jack\" may refer to the \"plug\" on the end of a removable cable. These connectors were originally referred to as \"jack plugs\", or plugs intended to be mated with fixed receptacles, or \"sockets\" (which North Americans would call \"jacks\"), but the second word was dropped. This variant usage is in direct contradiction to common usage and official standards in North America.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, for example, the connector on the end of a headphone lead is known as a \"jack\", that plugs into a \"socket\" on the main unit. The same generally occurs also in Italy, where the English word \"jack\" is commonly used to indicate the connector on the end of a headphone lead.\n\nIn Romania female connectors are known as \"mamă\" (mother) and male connectors are \"tată\" (father).\n\nThe standard letters \"M\" and \"F\" are commonly used in part numbers to designate connector gender. For example, in Switchcraft XLR microphone or hydrophone connectors, the part numbers are denoted as follows:\n\nThe terms plug, pin, and prong are also often used for \"male\" connectors, and receptacle, socket, and slot are used for \"female\" connectors. In many cases these terms are more common than \"male\" and \"female\", especially in documentation intended for the non-specialist. These nearly synonymous terms can cause a fair amount of confusion when the designations are shortened in labels.\n\nFor example, a female high-density D-subminiature connector with a size 1 shell can be named DE15F or DE15S (see accompanying pictures). Both terms mean the same thing but could be construed to be completely different items. Similarly, a male standard-density D-sub with a size 1 shell can be named DE9M or DE9P; a female standard-density D-sub with a size 2 shell can be named DA15F or DA15S; a male high-density D-sub with a size 3 shell can be named DB44M or DB44P; and so forth.\n\nElectronic designers often select female jack connectors for fixed mounting on electronic equipment they design. This is usually done because female connectors are more resistant to damage or contamination, by virtue of their concealed or recessed electrical contacts. A damaged motherboard connector can result in the scrapping of an expensive piece of electronic equipment. The risk of expensive damage is reduced by relegating the more exposed male contacts to connecting cables, which can be repaired or replaced at lower cost.\n\nWith an RS232 serial port, the male connector is more fragile than the female connector.\n\nSome people say the male coaxial connector is more prone to damage.\nOther people say the female coaxial connector is more prone to damage.\n\nSuch cost and reliability considerations probably drove the design decision to use female jack connectors on many computer terminals (and some personal computers) for the serial port, in direct violation of the connector gender convention specified in the RS-232 standard for \"DTE\" computer equipment. This confusing reversal of the RS-232 connector gender convention would cause many hours of frustration for ill-informed end users, as they tried to troubleshoot non-functional serial port equipment connections.\n\nIn the case of electrical power connections, designers do not reverse connector gender in such a casual fashion, because exposing live AC line power on male connectors is unsafe and generally illegal. Devices that need to be robust against mechanical damage use a special male IEC 60320 C14 connector (see Gallery above), which is recessed below the surface of a mounting panel, providing the desired physical protection while conforming to safety regulations.\n\nIn electrical connections where voltage or current is sufficient to cause injury, the part permanently connected to the power \"source\" is invariably female, with concealed contacts, to prevent inadvertent touching of live conductors. A male plug, with fully exposed protruding contacts, is installed on the cord of (or directly onto) the device \"receiving\" the power.\n\nIn the case of consumer-level AC power, connector gender is used to implicitly enforce safe use of power connectors. Because of this consideration, it is illegal under electrical code to make or use any \"gender changers\" to connect AC line power to consumer-level equipment.\n\nIn low-voltage use such as for data communications, electrical shock hazard is not an issue, and male or female connectors are used based on other engineering factors such as convenience of use, cost, or ease of manufacturing. For example, the common \"patch cables\" used for Ethernet (and the similar cords used for telephones) typically have male modular plugs on both ends, to connect to jacks on equipment or mounted in walls.\n\nAs an illustrative example of some design tradeoffs in power connector selection, consider the adjacent picture. A commonly seen coaxial power connector is usually set up so that power is fed \"from\" the female plug on the right \"into\" the male jack on the left (which is typically a part of the electronic device accepting the power). Although the plug is female, with a partially recessed center contact, it is still possible for casual accidental contact with a metallic object to short-circuit the power source. Depending on the design of the power adapter, it may react to a short circuit by shutting down temporarily, or instead by blowing out an internal safety fuse.\n\nIn this example, the marginal reliability of the connector choice was deemed to be acceptable by the equipment designer, since the power adapter supplies low voltage that does not pose an electric shock hazard. The potential fire hazard from accidental short-circuiting is addressed by the internal safety fuse, although this requires that a failed power adapter must be completely replaced. In a different design, if the power adapter were intended to supply a voltage sufficient to cause electrical shock, the semi-exposed center contact of the female plug would be considered unacceptably hazardous, requiring a different choice of power connector.\nSome electrical connectors are hermaphroditic because they include both male and female elements in a single unit intended to interconnect freely, without regard for gender. See the discussion of Genderless connectors elsewhere in this article for more detailed information.\n\nAs an additional complication, certain electronic connector designs may incorporate combinations of male and female pins in a \"single\" connector body, for mating with a complementary connector with opposite gender pins in corresponding positions. In these unusual cases, gender is often defined by the shape of the connector \"body\", rather than the mixed-gender connector \"pins\" and \"sockets\". These types of connectors are not strictly speaking hermaphroditic, since mating connectors are \"not\" freely interchangeable. An informal term that has been used for these connectors is \"bisexual\", in addition to the more official terminology, mixed-gender. Thus, for example, one can have a mixed-gender female plug that connects to a mixed-gender male jack (though a reversed gender assignment of connectors would be a more typical design choice in this example).\n\nMale connector pins are often protected by a shell (also called a shroud, surround, or shield), which may envelop the entire female connector when mated. RF connectors often have multiple layers of interlocking shells to properly connect the shields of coaxial and triaxial cable. In such cases, the gender is assigned based on the \"innermost\" connecting point. With the exception of reverse polarity BNC or TNC, where the outer shell determines the gender and the innermost connecting points are opposite to a standard connector, for example a female RP-TNC connector has a solid innermost pin.\n\nAnother ambiguous situation arises with the connectors used for USB, FireWire (IEEE-1394), HDMI, and Thunderbolt serial data bus connections. Close examination of these connectors reveals that the contact \"pins\" are not actually pins, but instead are conductive surfaces that slide past each other when they mate. Therefore, the traditional pin and socket nomenclature is not applicable. Instead, most computer hardware people fall back to referring to the wrap-around metal shield on the plug connector \"as if\" it were a connector \"pin\". By this convention, the connectors on serial bus cables are \"male plugs\", and the corresponding connectors on equipment are \"female jacks\". A unique connector configuration where the contacts are hermaphroditic is the ELCO Varicon where the contacts are bifurcated and nest with one another axial at a 90 degree rotation in cross-shaped wells. In this case the plugs had the contacts oriented transversely and the sockets longitudinally. \n\nA casual glance at a USB \"Type A\" plug connector may give the false impression that it is hermaphroditic. However, a physical attempt to mate two USB \"Type A\" cables with each other reveals the fact that the connectors will not interconnect. Classifying according to mathematical graph theory, USB buses are directed trees, whereas FireWire buses have a true bus network topology. This difference is reflected in the bus connectors used, in that USB cables are asymmetrical (one end Type A, other end Type B) while FireWire cables may have identical connectors at both ends.\n\nBy definition, a hermaphroditic connector includes mating surfaces having simultaneous male and female aspects, involving complementary paired identical parts each containing both protrusions and indentations. These mating surfaces are mounted into identical fittings which can freely mate with any other, without regard for gender (provided that the size and type are already matched). Alternative names include hermaphrodite, androgynous, genderless, sexless, combination (or combo), two-in-one, two-way, and other descriptive terms. Several of these latter alternate names are ambiguous in meaning, and should not be used unless carefully defined in context. True hermaphroditic connectors should not be confused with \"mixed gender\" connectors, which are described elsewhere in this article.\n\nAnother closely related type is the stackable connector for electronics, which typically has male pins on one surface, and complementary female sockets on the opposite surface, allowing multiple units to be stacked up like plastic milk crates. Examples of this include stackable banana plugs, and interconnect cables specified for the IEEE-488 instrumentation bus. Stackable mezzanine bus connectors are used on some modular microcomputer accessory boards for systems such as the Arduino add-on daughterboards called \"shields\". The older PC/104 embedded PC modules use a similar stackable format for interconnection. Stackable connectors are not classified as hermaphroditic in the strictest sense, but are often described as such in looser usage.\n\nThe hermaphroditic design is useful when multiple complex or lengthy components must be arbitrarily connected in various combinations. For example, if hoses have hermaphroditic fittings, they can be connected without having to pull a lengthy hose and reverse it because it has the wrong gender to connect to another hose. Some military fiber optical cables also have hermaphroditic connectors to prevent \"wrong gender\" connector problems in field deployments. In a similar fashion, railcars are usually equipped with hermaphroditic railway coupling mechanisms that allow either end of the vehicle to be connected to a train consist without having to turn the railcar around first.\nFor the same reason, several spacecraft docking mechanisms are designed to be \"androgynous\",\nincluding the Androgynous Peripheral Attach System, the NASA Docking System, and Chinese Docking Mechanism.\n\nIn the absence of genderless connectors, \"gender changer\" fittings might be used to enable certain connections. The designer of a connection system may use one or both schemes to allow arbitrary connectivity, or even combine both schemes into a single system.\n\nWhen an enforced sense of unidirectionality or \"one-way flow\" is required for safety or other reasons (for example, AC electrical power connections), a strict assignment of connector genders is implemented to prevent undesired configurations, and gender changers are banned.\n\nSome commonly seen examples of hermaphroditic connectors include the SAE connector for 12 V DC power, jackhammer air hose connectors, and the Anderson Powerpole series of modular high-current power connectors. The IBM token ring connector was another widespread example, but it has become obsolete and is being phased out. The General Radio Corporation (GenRad) developed a hermaphroditic coaxial radio frequency connector often called the \"GR connector\".\n\nSome audio multicore cables are fitted with hermaphroditic multipin quick-disconnect connectors for ease of use in the field. One style of this audio signal cable is fitted on both ends with connectors that are each populated half with pins and half with sockets. The advantage to the user is that it does not matter which end connects to the stage and which to the audio mixer, facilitating faster set up. Another style of connector uses hybrid male/female pins with a receiving slot fitted in the center of each two-tine pin, and relies on 90-degree rotation of the pin axes to mate. The connector housings themselves are sexed male and female.\n\nDevices used for mating two connectors of the same gender have a wide variety of terms, including for example: \"gender changer\", \"gender mender\", \"gender bender\", \"gender blender\", \"sex changer\", and \"homosexual adapter\". A specific gender changer can be referred to by either the gender of its connectors, or the gender which it is designed to connect to, resulting in a thoroughly ambiguous terminology. Thus a \"male gender changer\" might have female connectors to mate two male ends, or male connectors to mate two female ends.\n\nAdding to this potential for confusion, some gender changers also combine additional functions such as cross-over pin-outs or even embedding micro-controllers for performance, or for logic level or protocol adaptations, which would properly make them an adapter, but this nomenclature is sometimes neglected in marketing materials or common parlance.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "45038830", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45038830", "title": "God's Choice", "text": "God's Choice\n\nGod's Choice: The Total World of a Fundamentalist Christian School is a 1986 book written by Alan Peshkin and published by the University of Chicago Press. It is the product of his late 1970s 18-month ethnographic study of a 350-person Christian fundamentalist Baptist school in Illinois. He describes the K–12 day school's function as a total institution that educates about a singular truth (God's will) and subordination before God. The final chapter is a comparative analysis of the school and other schools, institutions, and social movements, wherein Peshkin concludes that the school is divisive in American society for promoting intolerance towards religious plurality, the very condition that permits the school's existence.\n\nReviewers wrote that Peshkin's account was fair, and praised his decision to let the participants speak for themselves through quotations. They also noted that the book filled a literary lacuna in scholarly understanding of the rapidly expanding and understudied fundamentalist Christian school.\n\n\"God's Choice: The Total World of a Fundamentalist Christian School\" is a 1986 book written by Alan Peshkin. It is a profile of an Illinois Christian fundamentalist school—its policies, practices, and participants. Peshkin, then Professor of Education at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, intended his account to be both impartial and \"empathetic\". He presents the fundamentalists as disciplined, dedicated, and determined with \"formulas for success\" opposite \"fragmented and defensive\" detractors. They believe in \"one Truth\"—God's plan—and reject philosophies of multiple truths. A teacher told Peshkin that their job is to prepare students for this \"one pattern\" of thought. In turn, the community's constituents do not wish to leave, but appreciate conformity as an end in itself. Peshkin describes the school as a \"total institution\": a place where many similar people live by their own formal rules apart from outside society, as based on Erving Goffman's 1961 essay. Peshkin asserts that this was a natural conclusion from a school \"based on absolute truth\". \"God's Choice\" was the third book in his series of studies on school–community relationships. It was published by the University of Chicago Press.\n\nIn 1978, Peshkin moved to an Illinois community of 50,000 people that he pseudonymically called Hartney, where he stayed and observed for 18 months. He lived in an apartment within the home of a family associated with what he called the Bethany Baptist church. Peshkin studied their 350-student K–12 Christian day school, Bethany Baptist Academy (also a pseudonym). The school opened six years prior with 88 students and was one of over one thousand members of the American Association of Christian Schools. The study focuses on the 125 students in the junior–senior high school. After a semester, Peshkin began to interview the community members, and used their quotes to let them \"speak for themselves\". The book includes eight portraits of students—four from faith and four \"scorners\" who \"consciously deviate\"—as well as student and teacher survey data, displayed in 16 tables. An appendix includes course offerings and a bibliography.\n\nPeshkin's findings show a \"total world\" where the lessons of religion and education are intertwined into an \"interrelated, interdependent\" philosophy. The academy's intent is to make Christian professionals as what Peshkin describes as \"a vocational school directed to work in the Lord's service\". When compared to the work of public schools, the private school's instructors said both kinds of institutions impose a lifestyle and set of values as a kind of \"brainwashing\". Peshkin notes that while students \"largely identify with\" and uphold the fundamentalist teachings, they permit themselves the option of having \"individual interpretations\" and minor beliefs. Some students either dissent against the academy's rules or are regarded as too pious, but most students are moderate.\n\nStudents take classes to be effective Christian leaders, including \"Bible study and 'soul-winning', English, speech, drama, and music\", which are seen as important to \"read and proclaim the Word\". Academy teachers establish their authority through discipline and teach \"the truth\" as established by \"facts\" from the Bible. Bible passages are associated with the subject matter in a process called \"integration\". The academy uses science books from Bob Jones University as an alternative to books that promote secular humanism, which is described as \"the 'official religion' of the public school system\". The Bob Jones science books associate the Bible with science, and often comment the relationship between God's intelligence and the intricacies of nature. Classes like science, social studies, and math are viewed as less important for the goal of making Christian professionals apart from their training to do \"everything a sinner can do, better\". Some classes are \"memorization and recitation\"-focused, reflecting an inelastic view of knowledge, which the academy believes to be fixed as based in biblical inerrancy. Their biggest external influence on curriculum is new books, which may affect how classes are taught, though the content (\"the truth\") remains the same.\n\nIn a chapter on teacher selection and training, the task of socializing students with obedience and discipline takes precedence over the task of teaching content. Students are under constant supervision to uphold a pledge to avoid outside activities such as theater, fashion, dances, and certain television shows. They also avoid some activities altogether, such as sexualized contact, drugs, alcohol, and smoking. This pledge is to be upheld at home as well, and students are encouraged to report errancies. Teachers too pledge to prioritize \"the pursuit of holiness\" over all things in a \"born again\" activity where they \"confess their sins and accept Jesus Christ as their personal savior\". The school is unapologetic in its insistence on \"telling the kids what is right\" and its according preference for lecture over discussion. Teachers are also afforded the option of corporal punishment, though it is rarely used.\n\nThe last two chapters feature Peshkin's commentary on the school in society, its tradeoffs and comparison with other total institutions and larger social movements, like the New Religious Right. He also compares the academy to public and parochial schools, wherein he finds public school students more politically tolerant and acceptant of religious pluralism. Peshkin's final reflections are written as a \"cost-benefit analysis\" of these Christian schools in the larger American society. In the last chapter, Peshkin contemplates how his Jewish identity is insulated within a pluralistic and secular society, and how he is fearful of absolutist \"imperious, implacable logic\" and \"zeal for conversion and exclusivism\". He recounted that while the school spoke derogatorily of non-fundamentalists and non-Christians, no one spoke of the American religious plurality that permitted this. In response to the encroaching state, fundamentalists feel that their political conviction should mirror that of their religion. Peshkin views the school as schismatic in a larger society for promoting intolerance towards fellow Americans. He also praised traits of the schools including its community, dedicated teachers, and attractive image. At the time of print, Christian schools like Bethany were outpacing the growth of other schools. In 1989, Christian schools comprised about 20% of private school enrollment—around 700,000 students.\n\nReviewers wrote that Peshkin's account was fair in its presentation, and that his choice to let individuals \"speak for themselves\" through abundant quotations was a strength. They also noted how the book filled a gap in the field and that his final chapter was too moralistic.\n\nR. Scott Appleby (\"American Journal of Education\") wrote that Peshkin succeeded at his attempt to be impartial, and that his presentation of fundamentalist culture is made both \"understandable\" and, in part, \"admirable\". He reflected that this Christian pedagogy was closer to indoctrination than education in that it did not develop \"critical skills and ... human capacities\" in \"open-ended\" learning but professed a fixed chain of knowledge \"from on high\" where humans are errant and need authoritarian guidance. Appleby added that fundamentalism blames public schools and its associated state apparatus as both a manufacturer enemy needed to feed its \"sense of crisis\" and for creating \"unsafe\" areas unregulated by \"Christian truth\". Sociologist Susan Rose \"broadens the base\" of \"God's Choice\" in her 1988 \"Keeping Them Out of the Hands of Satan\", and Appleby writes that the two books compliment each other's lacunae. While \"God's Choice\" has an \"engaging, sometimes riveting narrative\" with vivid characters but little outside information apart from statistics, \"Keeping Them Out of the Hands of Satan\" includes extra detail on how fundamentalist groups interact and share a larger societal milieu. For example, Rose explains the difference in \"born-again experiences\" of evangelicals and fundamentalists, which Peshkin glosses over.\n\nIn her own review of Peshkin's book, Rose (\"Contemporary Sociology\") praised its \"clear and detailed\" contribution to the field but wished for more overview material on the Christian School Movement's rise, proponents, philosophical consistency, and \"sociohistorical context\". She wrote that few had studied Christian schools, the \"fastest growing sector of private education in the United States\". In commending Peshkin's even-handedness, she wrote that his forthrightness about declaring his own biases and effort to present participant voices through direct quotation were strong elements, though he described more than he analyzed. Rose felt that the \"interesting\" final chapters of analysis and comparison with public schools \"grounded\" the overall ethnography, though she wished for more comparison of the adolescent student experience between the academy and other kinds of American schools. She considers Peshkin's \"discussion of the politics of pluralism\", that Christian schools both add to American religious pluralism while advocating against it, possibly his best contribution.\n\nJean Holm (\"The Times Higher Education Supplement\") too noted the fast growth of conservative Christian schools but added that the book was also relevant in Britain, which was experiencing similar growth. She found the first few chapters somewhat repetitive as it expressed the uniformity of the school's practices. Richard V. Pierard (\"Christian Century\") felt that Peshkin wrote with \"deeply respect\" for the school and its community, but Pierard, himself an evangelical, was \"disturbed\" by the community's \"indoctrinated\" values—\"biblical absolutes\" that are \"part of a conservative program that has been read into Scripture\". Paul F. Parsons (\"Christianity Today\") noted that Peshkin found the school successful by traditional terms, with standardized tests, orderly climate, and \"fun-loving\" students, but lacking free exchange of ideas, as education is seen more as a transfer than a quest, and students do not learn \"choice, doubt, suspended judgment, [or] dissent\". Parsons affirmed Peshkin's findings as \"remarkably representative\" based on his own visits to \"Christian schools in 60 cities\", though others are less absolutist. And while Julian McAllister Groves (\"Journal of Contemporary Ethnography\") described the text as \"beautifully written\" and \"poetic\", he doubted whether the school's students were as converted as they said, and felt that Peshkin might have seen more \"role distance\" and examples of playing along simply for community acceptance had he stayed for lunch and other informal observations.\n"}

{"id": "1752305", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1752305", "title": "Infinite Crisis", "text": "Infinite Crisis\n\n\"Infinite Crisis\" is a 2005–2006 comic book storyline published by DC Comics, consisting of an eponymous, seven-issue comic book limited series written by Geoff Johns and illustrated by Phil Jimenez, George Pérez, Ivan Reis, and Jerry Ordway, and a number of tie-in books. The main miniseries debuted in October 2005, and each issue was released with two variant covers: one by Pérez, and one by Jim Lee and Sandra Hope.\n\nThe series storyline was a sequel to DC's 1985 limited series \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", which \"rebooted\" much of the DC continuity in an effort to fix 50 years of contradictory character history. It revisited characters and concepts from that earlier \"Crisis\", including the existence of DC's Multiverse. Some of the characters featured were alternate versions of comic icons such as an alternate Superman named Kal-L, who came from a parallel universe called Earth-Two. A major theme was the nature of heroism, contrasting the often dark and conflicted modern-day heroes with memories of \"lighter\" and ostensibly more noble and collegial heroes of American comic books' earlier days.\n\n\"Infinite Crisis\" #1 was ranked first in the top 300 comics for October 2005 with pre-order sales of 249,265. This was almost double the second ranked comic \"House of M\" #7 which had pre-order sales of 134,429. \"Infinite Crisis\" #2 was also the top seller in top 300 comics for November 2005 with pre-order sales of 207,564.\n\nThe plot begins when, in \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", Kal-L (the Superman of pre-\"Crisis\" Earth-Two), the Superboy of Earth Prime, Alexander Luthor, Jr. of pre-Crisis Earth-Three, and Lois Lane Kent of pre-\"Crisis\" Earth-Two voluntarily sequestered themselves in \"paradise\". DC officially began leading up to the new \"Crisis\" with a one-shot issue \"Countdown to Infinite Crisis\", followed by four six-issue limited series that tied into and culminated in \"Infinite Crisis\".\n\nOnce the \"Crisis\" was completed, DC used the \"One Year Later\" event to move the narratives of most of its DC Universe series forward by one year. The weekly series \"52\" began publication in May 2006, and depicts some of the events which occurred between \"Infinite Crisis\" and \"One Year Later\".\n\nIn June 2008, a third and \"Final Crisis\" began a run, set immediately following the conclusion of the 51-issue \"Countdown to Final Crisis\".\n\n\"Infinite Crisis\" was announced in March 2005. The event was kicked off with the release of \"Countdown to Infinite Crisis\". \"Countdown to Infinite Crisis\" was followed by four six-issue limited series: \"The OMAC Project\", \"Rann–Thanagar War\", \"Day of Vengeance\", and \"Villains United\", as well as a four-part limited series \"DC Special: The Return of Donna Troy\". These first four limited series each had a special tie-in issue, released at monthly intervals during the \"Infinite Crisis\" event.\n\nAs with many large-scale comic crossovers, \"Infinite Crisis\" featured a large number of tie-ins. Before the event was announced, books such as \"Adam Strange\" and \"Identity Crisis\" were being described as part of bigger plans. After \"Countdown\", several books were identified as tie-ins to the four mini-series. Thus, although \"Infinite Crisis\" itself is only seven issues long, its plot elements appeared in dozens of publications.\n\nSome of these books were of direct and major importance, such as the \"Superman\" \"\"Sacrifice\" and \"JLA\" \"Crisis of Conscience\"\" storylines, the latter of which ended with the Justice League's lunar Watchtower being destroyed, leading directly into \"Infinite Crisis\" #1.\n\nDC Comics executive editor Dan DiDio stated that \"Infinite Crisis\" was being hinted at in various stories for two years prior to its launch, starting with the \"death\" of Donna Troy. The leadup was mostly understated until the release of the \"Adam Strange\" limited series in 2004, at which point industry press began to report that DC was planning a very large event, mentioning the titles \"Teen Titans\", \"The Flash\", and \"JSA\", all written by Geoff Johns. \n\nWith \"Countdown to Infinite Crisis\", \"Infinite Crisis\" began to visibly affect DC's editorial policy. Geoff Johns and Grant Morrison moved into editorial positions in addition to their writing duties, respectively to coordinate coherence of the DC Universe and to handle reimaginings of several characters. Mark Waid signed an exclusive contract with DC, receiving a similar editorial role. DC replaced its official decades-old logo (the \"DC bullet\") with a new one (the \"DC spin\") that debuted in the first issue of \"DC Special: The Return of Donna Troy\".\n\nAside from marking a major editorial shift within DC Comics, \"Infinite Crisis\" was a return to large company-wide crossovers of a sort that had been uncommon since the downturn of the comic industry in the 1990s.\n\nThe story begins in the wake of the four lead-in limited series, with Superman, Wonder Woman, and Batman feuding, the JLA Watchtower destroyed, and the heroes of the world all facing a variety of menaces. Over this backdrop, Kal-L (the Earth-Two Superman), along with Earth-Two's Lois Lane, Earth-Three's Alexander Luthor, and Superboy-Prime escape from the pocket universe where they had been left in at the end of \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\". Kal-L seeks out his cousin, Power Girl, also a survivor of Earth-Two. Believing Lois' health will improve on her native world, he hopes to replace the current Earth with Earth-Two, which he considers perfect.\n\nKal-L tries to enlist Batman's support, stating that the Post-Crisis Earth's inherent \"bad\" nature caused Batman's recent mistrust and hostility. Batman refuses and tries to use his Kryptonite Ring, but as this is not native to Kal-L's universe, it fails, and is destroyed by heat-vision. Afterward, Batman learns Superboy-Prime destroyed the JLA Watchtower.\n\nAlexander reveals to Power Girl that he and Superboy-Prime had been leaving their \"paradise\" for some time, manipulating events to help create an inter-dimensional tuning fork. Using the Anti-Monitor's remains and captured heroes and villains specifically attuned to former universes (Power Girl among them after Superboy-Prime knocks her out), Alex restores Earth-Two, unpopulated except for the Earth-Two heroes transported there.\n\nSuperboy-Prime attacks Conner Kent, this world's Superboy. Multiple super-teams intervene. Superboy-Prime accidentally kills several heroes before the Flashes and Kid Flash force him into the Speed Force, assisted by the speedsters already within it. Jay Garrick, the only speedster left behind, says the Speed Force is now gone.\n\nSeeking to create a perfect world, Alexander restores many alternate Earths. The Earth-Two Lois dies, and an aggrieved Kal-L and the younger Superman Kal-El fight until Wonder Woman separates them. Bart Allen (wearing Barry Allen's costume and aged to adulthood) emerges from the Speed Force, warning that he and the other speedsters were unable to hold Superboy-Prime, who returns wearing Anti-Monitor inspired armor that stores yellow sun radiation to empower him, making him even stronger.\n\nBatman's strike force destroys Brother Eye, a satellite AI created by Batman that had gone rogue and begun transforming civilians into nano-infused robots. Alexander selects and merges alternate Earths, trying to create a \"perfect\" world, until Firestorm blocks his efforts. Conner, Nightwing, and Wonder Girl release the Tower's prisoners. Fighting each other, Conner and Superboy-Prime collide with the tower, destroying it. The multiple Earths recombine into a \"New Earth\" as Conner dies in Wonder Girl's arms. Power Girl soon arrives and asks Kal-El what happened to Lois. The answer causes her to break down prompting her to ask Kal-L why.\n\nHe answers her simply, telling her it was because he chose the wrong Superboy to condemn and the wrong Superboy to condone.\n\nWhen a horde of supervillains attack Metropolis, heroes, current and retired, fly off to the rescue. They are joined by the National Guard. The battle results in multiple deaths on both sides, including many by Superboy-Prime himself, who kills villains and heroes alike. During the battle, Superboy-Prime takes off to destroy Oa, planning to collapse the Universe, and recreate it with himself as the only superhero. Superboy-Prime breaks through a 300-mile thick wall of willpower created by the Green Lantern Corps and then kills thirty-two Green Lanterns before Kal-L and Kal-El carry him toward what is left of Krypton. It is essentially a huge cloud of kryptonite. Flying through Krypton's red sun, Rao, destroys Superboy-Prime's armor and causes all three Kryptonians' powers to diminish. Falling to the sentient planet (and Green Lantern Corps member) Mogo, they fight. Kal-El finally knocks Superboy-Prime out and the older Superman Kal-L dies of his injuries in the arms of his cousin, Power Girl.\n\nBack on Earth, Batman, struggling with Superboy's death and Nightwing's severe injuries sustained during the Metropolis battle, contemplates shooting Alex. Batman is discouraged by Wonder Woman. Alex manages to escape.\n\nWonder Woman, Batman, and Superman later meet up in Gotham City. Wonder Woman plans to find out who she is. Batman plans a similar journey of self-discovery, revisiting the training of his youth, this time with Dick Grayson, now healthier, and with Tim Drake joining him. Superman retires from super heroics until his powers return.\n\nHiding in an alley in Gotham City and making new plans, Alexander Luthor is found by Lex Luthor and the Joker. The Joker deforms him by spraying acid onto his face, then electrifies it, and finally, kills Alexander by shooting him as Lex mocks him for making the mistake of not letting the Joker play in the Secret Society.\n\nThe Green Lantern Corps imprison Superboy-Prime inside a red Sun-Eater. The series ends with him carving an \"S\" into his chest with his bare hands and declaring that he has escaped from worse prisons than this.\n\nThe series and tie-ins have been collected into individual volumes:\n\n\nThe hardcover collecting all seven issues of \"Infinite Crisis\" included changes in coloring, as well as, more significantly, alterations in dialogue, most of which relate to hints to the re-emergence of the DC Multiverse.\nAlso changed is the two-page spread near the end of the book, where a new George Pérez image is substituted. Four additional pages of art by Phil Jimenez were added, who also illustrated new cover art for the dust jacket of hardcover collection. An interview section included as an afterword explains the reasoning behind some of these alterations.\n\n\nA number of series were canceled with the \"One Year Later\" jump. Some ended outright, like \"Batgirl\", \"Gotham Central\", and \"\", while others were suspended and restarted later with new volumes, notably \"JLA\", \"JSA\", \"Flash\", and \"Wonder Woman\". Additionally, \"Adventures of Superman\" returned to its original title of \"Superman\", while the book that had previously been coming out as \"Superman\" since 1987 was canceled, thus making the Superman line's two books, \"Superman\" and \"Action Comics\", match the Batman lines \"Batman\" and \"Detective Comics\" (in addition to the shared title \"Batman and Superman\".)\n\nAce Books, under the imprint of the Berkley Publishing Group and published by the Penguin Group, released an October 2006 novelization adaption of the series written by Greg Cox, with an introduction by Mark Waid, and cover art designed by Georg Brewer and illustrated by Daniel Acuña. The novel was primarily adapted from the seven-issues mini-series published by DC Comics (December 2005 to June 2006). Additional materials on the book was adapted from:\n\n\nGraphicAudio produced an audiobook of the novelization of \"Infinite Crisis\". The audiobook spans two volumes with 6 CDs each and features a full cast, music and sound effects. Volume 1 released May 2007 runs 6 hours, and Volume 2 released June 2007 runs 7 hours.\n\nIn March 25, 2013, WB Games and DC Comics announced a multiplayer online battle arena video game adaptation loosely based on the comic book series. The game was developed by Turbine, Inc.\n\n"}
{"id": "7473451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7473451", "title": "Italia turrita", "text": "Italia turrita\n\nItalia Turrita () is the national personification or allegory of Italy, characterised by a mural crown (hence \"turrita\" or \"with towers\" in Italian) typical of Italian civic heraldry of Medieval communal origin. In broader terms, the crown symbolizes its mostly urban history. She often holds in her hands a bunch of corn ears (a symbol of fertility and reference to the agrarian economy); during the fascist era, she held a bundle of fasces.\n\nItaly’s first allegory, a laurel-crowned female head, appears on the coins coined during the Social War between the Roman Republic and several other cities of Central Italy from 91 to 88 BC. Under the emperor Augustus, an allegorical representation of Italy known as \"Saturnia Tellus\" was sculpted in marble on \"Ara Pacis’\" external wall (13-9 BC) in Rome. Another allegory of Italy appears on the coins coined during the reign of emperor Nerva in 97 AD. \n\nThe representation of \"Italia turrita\" was proposed under the emperor Trajan, who wanted it to be sculpted on the Trajan’s Arch erected in Benevento in 114-117, and also on one of the two \"Pluteos\" called \"anaglypha\", four years later. Afterwards, from 130 AD on, under the emperors Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, Marcus Aurelius, Commodus, Septimius Severus and Caracalla, Roman coins reproduced the allegorical representation of Italy as a dressed and towered woman who sometimes carries a cornucopia. The towered crown is the symbol of \"Civitas romana\", therefore the allegory shows the sovereignty of the Italian peninsula as a land of free cities and of Roman citizens to whom a proper right has been granted: the \"Ius Italicum\".\n\nThis mythographical setting-up of the Italian land became also popular during the Middle Ages. In 1490, Ludovico Sforza, duke of Milan, had an \"Italia turrita\" painted on a medallion of the castle in Piazza Ducale, Vigevano. The \"Caesaris Astrum\" appeared again in 1574 on the cover of \"Historiarium de Regno Italiae\", a book written by the historian Carlo Sigonio.\n\nOver her head, a five-pointed star is usually seen shining radiant; an ancient secular symbol of Italy purported to protect the nation, known as \"Stella d'Italia\" or Star of Italy. Iconographic of the Risorgimento, it was used as the crest of the armorial bearings of the Kingdom of Italy from 1870 to 1890 and is the dominant element in the modern day emblem of Italy adopted at the birth of the Italian Republic in 1948.\n\n\n\n"}

Early documentation of the game includes a 1932 Tel Aviv beach scene by Israeli artist Nahum Gutman showing two young men holding rounded paddles and hitting a ball back and forth on the beach.\n\nThe goal of the game is to hit a small rubber ball with a wooden racket as many times as possible without dropping it. Two or more players hit the ball back and forth using paddles. The sport is named after the racquet, the \"matka\"; the origin of this word is unclear.\n\nThe racquets are traditionally made of wood, although sometimes the handles are reinforced with a plastic covering. Carbon fiber is also used. The head of a racquet may vary somewhat in size and shape. The heads are circular and about in diameter. The racquet handles are short, and with very little trunk between the handle and the racquet head. \n\nThe standard ball used is the same ball as is used in squash. However, novice and intermediate players sometimes use a ball that is similar in size to a squash ball, but lighter and/or bouncier.\n\nThe game has developed a moderate level of popularity outside of Israel as a participatory sport, particularly where there is either a strong beach culture (e.g. Brazil, where it is also highly popular, but more commonly known as frescoball), or a significant number of Israelis living abroad (e.g. Thailand).\n\nThe first Israeli matkot competition was held in 2000, capped by a national championship in Tel Aviv.\n\n\n"}

It is located in the Kawajangtsa area of Thimphu, above the Royal Thimphu Golf Course, near the Folk Heritage Museum and the National Institute for Zorig Chusum (Traditional Arts and Crafts).\n\nThe National Library of Bhutan was first established in 1967 under the patronage of HM Queen Ashi Phuntso Choden (1911–2003), with a small collection of precious texts. The library was initially housed within the central tower (utse) of Tashichodzong. Later, due to its growing collection, it had to move to a building in the Changgangkha area of Thimphu.\n\nTo provide a permanent home for the sacred religious books and manuscripts in the growing collection, construction of the present four-storeyed eight-cornered traditional building, which looks like the central tower temple of a Bhutanese Dzong, in the Kawajangtsa area of Thimphu was initiated. The cost of the construction of this building was borne entirely by the Royal Government of Bhutan without any foreign aid.\n\nThis building, which houses the collection of traditional texts, was inaugurated and consecrated as a temple by H.H. Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche on November 23, 1984 in order to provide a sacred space for the religious books which form the bulk of the collection. The library moved into its permanent home at the end of 1984 under the auspices of the then Special Commission for Cultural Affairs.\n\n\nThe National Archives is responsible for collecting and preserving important past, present and future documents on Bhutan for future generations.\n\nIn July 2000 Denmark signed an agreement to support the National Archives to provide assistance for the construction of a modern archive building. This two storied building, which was completed in 2004 is equipped with a modern security and fire alarm system as well as temperature and humidity control.\n\nThe repository rooms of the archives now house many important documents including old records, old letters and around seven thousand important photographs. The archives also hold microfilms of many other important documents. Particularly rare and important books and manuscripts from the National Library collection are also kept in their secure and controlled facilities. Thus the archives is the foundation of our National Memory Bank.\n\nThe National Archives solicits co-operation from all concerned in its effort to create our National Memory Bank. We therefore request individuals and institutions, inside and outside the country holding important documents and other material related to Bhutan which may be of interest to future generations, to provide copies for our National Archives.\n\nThe National Library offers a free microfilming service for institutions and individuals within Bhutan holding important and rare texts and documents. They actively encourage anyone holding such documents to bring them to the library for microfilming in order to ensure the long term preservation of the contents of these documents should anything happen to the original. Upon microfilming the original text or document will be returned to the provider along with one microfilm copy, and one copy will be held in the archives in safe and secure controlled storage conditions.\n\nThe archives primarily deals with paper documents. Paper is composed of organic materials which deteriorate with the passage of time. Documents printed on modern paper often contain bleaches and other chemicals which can speed up this deterioration. Similarly photographs and film often contains chemical traces left over from processing which can cause deterioration. Therefore, when documents or photographs are selected for preservation it is important that they are treated to neutralize these harmful chemical residues.\n\nNational Assembly of Bhutan hereby enacts this Legal Deposit Act: An Act to Collect, Preserve and Manage Bhutan’s Documentary Heritage in July 20, 1999 to legally collect and save print, non-print, electronic, audio visual and electronic texts, all the forms of documents that relate to the Bhutan and national interests. There are eight parts in the Legal Deposit Act.\n\nIn the 10th five-year plan the National Archives plans to carry out a nationwide survey to determine where records of national importance are located; and in what form, shape and condition these records are being maintained. If such records are not being taken care of properly we will endeavour to assist the owners and custodians of these records to ensure their proper preservation.\n\nThey also plan to create special Oral History Tradition and Audio Visual Unit to survey, create and maintain Oral History and Audio Visual documentation for the nation.\n\n\n"}

(Although the town's name was never specified in the show, some media sources identified it as Norwich.)\n\nDick is a sane, mild-mannered everyman surrounded by a community of oddballs in a town that exists in an illogical world governed by rules that elude him. Near the end of the second season, Dick began hosting a low-rated talk show on the town's local television station. As the series progressed, episodes focused increasingly on Dick's TV career and the quirky townsfolk.\n\n\n\nThe series finale of \"Newhart\", titled \"The Last Newhart\", has been described as one of the most memorable in television history. The entire town is purchased by a visiting Japanese tycoon, who turns the hamlet into an enormous golf course and recreation resort. Dick and Joanna are the only townspeople who refuse to leave. The others accept huge payoffs and leave in a farewell scene that parodies \"Fiddler on the Roof\".\n\nFive years later, Dick and Joanna continue to run the Stratford Inn, which is now located in the middle of the golf course. The other townspeople, now richer and older than before, unexpectedly return for a reunion. The Darryl brothers also speak for the first time on screen, loudly yelling \"Quiet!\" at their wives in unison. Dick gets frustrated with the increasingly chaotic scene, and storms out shouting \"You're all crazy!\", only to be knocked out by an errantly struck golf ball.\n\nThe setting of the last scene is nighttime, in the bedroom of Dr. Bob Hartley (\"The Bob Newhart Show\") and his wife Emily (Suzanne Pleshette). Hartley awakens, upset, and he wakes Emily to tell her about the very strange dream he has just had: that he was an innkeeper in a small Vermont town filled with eccentric characters and married to a beautiful blonde. Emily tells him he can not have Japanese food before bed anymore.\n\nSeveral references are made to Newhart's former show, including the use of its theme song and credits. Although the \"Bob Newhart Show\" theme was missing from the final closing credit shot in the series' initial syndication run, the theme has been reinstated in the current version syndicated by 20th Century Fox Television.\n\nThe MTM cat logo normally closed the show end credits with Newhart voicing-over the \"meow\", but for the finale, the cat's voiceover was a reprise of Darryl and Darryl yelling \"Quiet!\"\n\nInterviews with Newhart, Pleshette, and director Dick Martin reveal that the final scene was kept a secret from the cast and most of the crew. A fake ending was written to throw off the tabloids that involved Dick Loudon going to heaven after being hit with a golf ball and talking to God played by George Burns or George C. Scott. Pleshette was kept hidden until her scene was shot. When the scene began, many people in the live audience recognized the set as the bedroom from \"The Bob Newhart Show\" and burst into spontaneous applause. Pleshette and Newhart did the scene in one take.\n\nIn 1991, the cast of \"The Bob Newhart Show\" reunited in a primetime special. One of the things they did was analyze Bob's dream. During the discussion, the Hartleys' neighbor, Howard Borden (Bill Daily), quipped, \"I had a dream like that once. I dreamed I was an astronaut in Florida for five seasons\", while scenes were shown from \"I Dream of Jeannie\", which featured Daily in all five seasons. At the end of the reunion special, Dr. Bob Hartley gets on the elevator only to see three familiar workmen doing repairs in the elevator and one of them says to Bob, \"Hi. I'm Larry. This is my brother Darryl and this is my other brother Darryl.\"\n\nIn his book \"I Shouldn't Even Be Doing This! And Other Things that Strike Me as Funny\", Newhart stated that his wife Ginnie proposed the ending of \"Newhart\". He reiterated this in a 2013 interview with director and comedian David Steinberg, saying,\nIn a letter-to-the-editor published in \"Entertainment Weekly\", the show's executive producers, Mark Egan, Mark Solomon, and Bob Bendetson, wrote, \"[T]he final episode of \"Newhart\" was not 'dreamed up' by Bob's wife, Ginny. She had absolutely no connection with the show. ... We wrote and produced the Emmy-nominated script (with special thanks to Dan O'Shannon).\"\n\nIn November 2005, the series finale was named by \"TV Guide\" and TV Land as the most unexpected moment in TV history. The episode was watched by 29.5 million viewers, bringing in an 18.7/29 rating/share, and ranking as the most-watched program that week.\n\nIn 2011, the finale was ranked number four on the TV Guide Network special, \"TV's Most Unforgettable Finales\", and in 2013 was ranked number 1 in Entertainment Weekly's \"20 Best TV Series Finales Ever\".\n\nOn the February 11, 1995, episode of \"Saturday Night Live\" which was hosted by Bob Newhart, the episode's closing sketch ended with a redux of \"Newhart\"'s final scene, in which Bob Hartley again wakes with his wife Emily (special guest Suzanne Pleshette) and tells her that he had just had a dream of hosting \"Saturday Night Live\". Emily responds, \"\"Saturday Night Live\", is that show still on?\"—this during a period when \"SNL\" was heavily criticized for its declining quality.\n\nIn 2010, \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" presented several parody alternate endings to the television show \"Lost\", one of which mirrored the finale of \"Newhart\" complete with a cameo appearance by Bob Newhart and with \"Lost\" star Evangeline Lilly in place of Emily/Pleshette.\n\nThe final scene with Newhart and Pleshette was later parodied in an alternate ending to the television series \"Breaking Bad\" where actor Bryan Cranston wakes from a dream next to his \"Malcolm in the Middle\" co-star Jane Kaczmarek where they assume their respective roles of Hal and Lois. Hal recounts the events of \"Breaking Bad\" in humorous fashion as though he is horrified that he could do those things albeit as Walter White. Lois reassures him that everything is all right and the final shot is of Walter's hat.\n\nThe final scene of \"The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson\" parodied this, as well. After revealing that Bob Newhart had been playing the on-set pantomime horse Secretariat, Ferguson wakes up as his \"The Drew Carey Show\" character Nigel Wick, in bed with his co-star Drew Carey. The two then discuss the crazy possibility of Wick being a talk show host and Carey losing weight and becoming a game show host. (The shot continued with a parody of the twist ending of \"St. Elsewhere\" and then the closing song from \"The Sopranos\" finale.)\n\n\"Newhart\" was a solid ratings winner, finishing six out of eight seasons in the Nielsen top 25 at its highest rating of number 12 for two consecutive seasons from 1986 to 1988. Despite not finishing in the top 30 for its last two seasons, Bob Newhart stated in an interview with the Archive of American Television that CBS was satisfied enough with the show's ratings to renew it for a ninth season in 1990. However, Newhart, who was anxious to move onto other projects, declined the offer, promising CBS that he would develop a new series for the network, which he was under contract to do. This resulted in the 1992 series \"Bob\", which lasted for two seasons.\n\nDespite 25 nominations, \"Newhart\" never won an Emmy Award.\n\n\n\"Newhart\" earned a total of six nominations for Golden Globe Awards.\n\nNewhart was nominated for one Casting Society of America award and four nominations for TV Land Awards. \"Newhart\" won a total of Viewers for Quality Television Awards.\n\n20th Century Fox released season one of \"Newhart\" on DVD in Region 1 on February 26, 2008.\n\nIn November 2013, it was announced that Shout! Factory had acquired the rights to the series. As of April 15, 2017, they have released the second through eighth seasons.\n\n"}
{"id": "23266996", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23266996", "title": "Patriarchy", "text": "Patriarchy\n\nPatriarchy is a social system in which males hold primary power and predominate in roles of political leadership, moral authority, social privilege and control of property. Some patriarchal societies are also patrilineal, meaning that property and title are inherited by the male lineage.\n\nPatriarchy is associated with a set of ideas, a patriarchal ideology that acts to explain and justify this dominance and attributes it to inherent natural differences between men and women. Sociologists tend to see patriarchy as a social product and not as an outcome of innate differences between the sexes and they focus attention on the way that gender roles in a society affect power differentials between men and women.\n\nHistorically, patriarchy has manifested itself in the social, legal, political, religious, and economic organization of a range of different cultures. Even if not explicitly defined to be by their own constitutions and laws, most contemporary societies are, in practice, patriarchal.\n\n\"Patriarchy\" literally means \"the rule of the father\" and comes from the Greek πατριάρχης (\"patriarkhēs\"), \"father of a race\" or \"chief of a race, patriarch\", which is a compound of πατριά (\"patria\"), \"lineage, descent\" (from πατήρ \"patēr\", \"father\") and ἄρχω (\"arkhō\"), \"I rule\".\n\nHistorically, the term \"patriarchy\" was used to refer to autocratic rule by the male head of a family. However, since the late 20th century it has more often been used to refer to social systems in which power is primarily held by adult men, particularly by writers associated with second-wave feminism such as Kate Millett; these writers sought to use an understanding of patriarchal social relations to liberate women from male domination. This concept of patriarchy was developed to explain male dominance as a social, rather than biological, phenomenon.\n\nThe sociologist Sylvia Walby defines patriarchy as \"a system of social structures and practices in which men dominate, oppress, and exploit women\". Social stratification along gender lines, in which power is predominantly held by men, has been observed in most societies.\n\nAnthropological, archaeological, and evolutionary psychological evidence suggests that most prehistoric hunter-gatherer societies were relatively egalitarian, and that patriarchal social structures did not develop until many years after the end of the Pleistocene era, following social and technological developments such as agriculture and domestication. According to Robert M. Strozier, historical research has not yet found a specific \"initiating event\". Gerda Lerner asserts that there was no single event, and documents that patriarchy as a social system arose in different parts of the world at different times. Some scholars point to about six thousand years ago (4000 BCE), when the concept of fatherhood took root, as the beginning of the spread of patriarchy.\n\nMarxist theory, as articulated mainly by Friedrich Engels, assigns the origin of patriarchy to the emergence of private property, which has traditionally been controlled by men. In this view, men directed household production and sought to control women in order to ensure the passing of family property to their own (male) offspring, while women were limited to household labor and producing children. Lerner disputes this idea, arguing that patriarchy emerged before the development of class-based society and the concept of private property.\n\nDomination by men of women is found in the Ancient Near East as far back as 3100 BCE, as are restrictions on a woman's reproductive capacity and exclusion from \"the process of representing or the construction of history\". According to some researchers, with the appearance of the Hebrews, there is also \"the exclusion of woman from the God-humanity covenant\".\n\nThe archaeologist Marija Gimbutas argues that waves of kurgan-building invaders from the Ukrainian steppes into the early agricultural cultures of Old Europe in the Aegean, the Balkans and southern Italy instituted male hierarchies that led to the rise of patriarchy in Western society. Steven Taylor argues that the rise of patriarchal domination was associated with the appearance of socially stratified hierarchical polities, institutionalised violence and the separated individuated ego associated with a period of climatic stress.\n\nA prominent Greek general Meno, in the Platonic dialogue of the same name, sums up the prevailing sentiment in Classical Greece about the respective virtues of men and women. He says:\nThe works of Aristotle portrayed women as morally, intellectually, and physically inferior to men; saw women as the property of men; claimed that women's role in society was to reproduce and to serve men in the household; and saw male domination of women as natural and virtuous.\n\nGerda Lerner, author of \"The Creation of Patriarchy,\" states that Aristotle believed that women had colder blood than men, which made women not evolve into men, the sex that Aristotle believed to be perfect and superior. Maryanne Cline Horowitz stated that Aristotle believed that \"soul contributes the form and model of creation\". This implies that any imperfection that is caused in the world must be caused by a woman because one cannot acquire an imperfection from perfection (which he perceived as male). Aristotle had a hierarchical ruling structure in his theories. Lerner claims that through this patriarchal belief system, passed down generation to generation, people have been conditioned to believe that men are superior to women. These symbols are benchmarks which children learn about when they grow up, and the cycle of patriarchy continues much past the Greeks.\n\nEgypt left no philosophical record, but Herodotus left a record of his shock at the contrast between the roles of Egyptian women and the women of Athens. He observed that Egyptian women attended market and were employed in trade. In ancient Egypt, middle-class women were eligible to sit on a local tribunal, engage in real estate transactions, and inherit or bequeath property. Women also secured loans, and witnessed legal documents. Athenian women were denied such rights.\n\nGreek influence spread, however, with the conquests of Alexander the Great, who was educated by Aristotle.\n\nDuring this time period in China, gender roles and patriarchy remained shaped by Confucianism. Adopted as the official religion in the Han dynasty, Confucianism has strong dictates regarding the behavior of women, declaring a woman's place in society, as well as outlining virtuous behavior. \"Three Obediences and Four Virtues\", a Confucian text, places a woman's value on her loyalty and obedience. It explains that an obedient woman is to obey their father before her marriage, her husband after marriage, and her first son if widowed, and that a virtuous woman must practice sexual propriety, proper speech, modest appearance, and hard work. Ban Zhao, a Confucian disciple, writes in her book \"Precepts for Women\", that a woman's primary concern is to subordinate themselves before patriarchal figures such as a husband or father, and that they need not concern themselves with intelligence or talent. Ban Zhao is considered by some historians as an early champion for women's education in China, however her extensive writing on the value of a woman's mediocrity and servile behavior leaves others feeling that this narrative is the result of a misplaced desire to cast her in a contemporary feminist light. Similarly to \"Three Obediences and Four Virtues\", \"Precepts for Women\" was meant as a moral guide for proper feminine behavior, and was widely accepted as such for centuries.\n\nIn China's Ming Dynasty, widowed women were expected to never re-marry, and unmarried women were expected to remain chaste for the duration of their lives. Biographies of Exemplary Women, a book containing biographies of women who lived according to the Confucian ideals of virtuous womanhood, popularized an entire genre of similar writing during the Ming dynasty. Women who lived according to this Neo-Confucian ideal were celebrated in official documents, and some had structures erected in their honor.\n\nAlthough many 16th and 17th century theorists agreed with Aristotle's views concerning the place of women in society, none of them tried to prove political obligation on the basis of the patriarchal family until sometime after 1680. The patriarchal political theory is closely associated with Sir Robert Filmer. Sometime before 1653, Filmer completed a work entitled \"Patriarcha\". However, it was not published until after his death. In it, he defended the divine right of kings as having title inherited from Adam, the first man of the human species, according to Judeo-Christian tradition.\n\nHowever, in the latter half of the 18th century, clerical sentiments of patriarchy were meeting challenges from intellectual authorities – Diderot's Encyclopedia denies inheritance of paternal authority stating, \"... reason shows us that mothers have rights and authority equal to those of fathers; for the obligations imposed on children originate equally from the mother and the father, as both are equally responsible for bringing them into the world. Thus the positive laws of God that relate to the obedience of children join the father and the mother without any differentiation; both possess a kind of ascendancy and jurisdiction over their children...\"\n\nIn the 19th century, various women began to question the commonly accepted patriarchal interpretation of Christian scripture. One of the foremost of these was Sarah Grimké, who voiced skepticism about the ability of men to translate and interpret passages relating to the roles of the sexes without bias. She proposed alternative translations and interpretations of passages relating to women, and she applied historical and cultural criticism to a number of verses, arguing that their admonitions applied to specific historical situations, and were not to be viewed as universal commands.\n\nElizabeth Cady Stanton used Grimké's criticism of biblical sources to establish a basis for feminist thought. She published \"The Woman's Bible\", which proposed a feminist reading of the Old and New Testament. This tendency was enlarged by feminist theory, which denounced the patriarchal Judeo-Christian tradition. In his essay, \"A Judicial Patriarchy: Family Law at the Turn of the Century\", Michael Grossberg coined the phrase \"judicial patriarchy\" stating that, \"The judge became the buffer between the family and the state.\" and that, \"Judicial patriarchs dominated family law because within these institutional and intraclass rivalries judges succeeded in protecting their power over the law governing the hearth.\n\nIn China's Qing Dynasty, laws governing morality, sexuality, and gender-relations continued to be based on Confucian teachings. Men and women were both subject to strict laws regarding sexual behavior, however men were punished infrequently in comparison to women. Additionally, women's punishment often carried strong social stigma, \"rendering [women] unmarriageable,\" a stigma which did not follow men. Similarly, in the People's Republic of China, laws governing morality which were written as egalitarian were selectively enforced favoring men, permissively allowing female infanticide, while infanticide of any form was, by the letter of the law, prohibited.\nIn the modern era, the concept of Patriarchy is asserted to manifest itself in institutionalized control, rather than simply being about an individual's sexism.\n\nFeminist theorists have written extensively about patriarchy either as a primary cause of women's oppression, or as part of an interactive system. Shulamith Firestone, a radical-libertarian feminist, defines patriarchy as a system of oppression of women. Firestone believes that patriarchy is caused by the biological inequalities between women and men, e.g. that women bear children, while men do not. Firestone writes that patriarchal ideologies support the oppression of women and gives as an example the joy of giving birth, which she labels a patriarchal myth. For Firestone, women must gain control over reproduction in order to be free from oppression. Feminist historian Gerda Lerner believes that male control over women's sexuality and reproductive functions is a fundamental cause and result of patriarchy. Alison Jaggar also understands patriarchy as the primary cause of women's oppression. The system of patriarchy accomplishes this by alienating women from their bodies.\n\nInteractive systems theorists Iris Marion Young and Heidi Hartmann believe that patriarchy and capitalism interact together to oppress women. Young, Hartmann, and other socialist and Marxist feminists use the terms \"patriarchal capitalism\" or \"capitalist patriarchy\" to describe the interactive relationship of capitalism and patriarchy in producing and reproducing the oppression of women. According to Hartmann, the term \"patriarchy\" redirects the focus of oppression from the labour division to a moral and political responsibility liable directly to men as a gender. In its being both systematic and universal, therefore, the concept of patriarchy represents an adaptation of the Marxist concept of class and class struggle..\n\nAudre Lorde, an African American feminist writer and theorist, believed that racism and patriarchy were intertwined systems of oppression. Sara Ruddick, a philosopher who wrote about \"good mothers\" in the context of maternal ethics, describes the dilemma facing contemporary mothers who must train their children within a patriarchal system. Does a \"good mother,\" she asks, train her son to be competitive, individualistic, and comfortable within the hierarchies of patriarchy, knowing that he may likely be economically successful but a mean person? Or does a good mother resist patriarchal ideologies and socialize her son to be cooperative and communal but economically unsuccessful?\n\nGerda Lerner, in her 1986 \"The Creation of Patriarchy\", makes a series of arguments about the origins and reproduction of patriarchy as a system of oppression of women, and concludes that patriarchy is socially constructed and seen as natural and invisible.\n\nSome feminist theorists believe that patriarchy is an unjust social system that is harmful to both men and women. It often includes any social, political, or economic mechanism that evokes male dominance over women. Because patriarchy is a social construction, it can be overcome by revealing and critically analyzing its manifestations.\n\nJaggar, Young, and Hartmann are among the feminist theorists who argue that the system of patriarchy should be completely overturned, especially the heteropatriarchal family, which they see as a necessary component of female oppression. The family not only serves as a representative of the greater civilization by pushing its own affiliates to change and obey, but performs as a component in the rule of the patriarchal state that rules its inhabitants with the head of the family.\n\nMany feminists (especially scholars and activists) have called for culture repositioning as a method for deconstructing patriarchy. Culture repositioning relates to culture change. It involves the reconstruction of the cultural concept of a society. Prior to the widespread use of the term \"patriarchy\", early feminists used \"male chauvinism\" and \"sexism\" to refer roughly to the same phenomenon. Author bell hooks argues that the new term identifies the ideological system itself (that men claim dominance and superiority to women) that can be believed and acted upon by either men or women, whereas the earlier terms imply only men act as oppressors of women.\n\nSociologist Joan Acker, analyzing the concept of patriarchy and the role that it has played in the development of feminist thought, says that seeing patriarchy as a universal, trans-historical and trans-cultural phenomenon where \"women were everywhere oppressed by men in more or less the same ways […] tended toward a biological essentialism.”\n\nAnne Pollart has described attempts the use of patriarchy as circular and conflating description and explanation. She remarks the discourse on patriarchy creates a ‘theoretical impasse […] imposing a structural label on what it is supposed to explain’ and therefore impoverishes the possibility to explain gender inequalities.\n\nAs a common standard of differentiation between sexes, advocates for a patriarchal society like to focus on the influences that hormones have over biological systems. Hormones have been declared as the \"key to the sexual universe\" because they are present in all animals and are the driving force in two critical developmental stages: sex-determinism in the fetus, and puberty in the teenage individual. Playing a critical role in the development of the brain and behavior, testosterone and estrogen have been labeled the \"male-hormone\" and \"female-hormone\" respectively as a result of the impact they have when masculinizing or feminizing an individual.\n\nSociologists tend to reject predominantly biological explanations of patriarchy and contend that socialization processes are primarily responsible for establishing gender roles. According to standard sociological theory, patriarchy is the result of sociological constructions that are passed down from generation to generation. These constructions are most pronounced in societies with traditional cultures and less economic development. Even in modern, developed societies, however, gender messages conveyed by family, mass media, and other institutions largely favor males having a dominant status.\n\nBiologist Richard Lewontin asserts that patriarchy persists through social and political reasons, rather than purely biological causes. Opponents of gender feminism, such as Christina Hoff Sommers, have argued that patriarchy has its origin in biological factors.\n\nThis is called biological determinism, which looks at humanity from a strictly biological point of view. Thus, the evolution of science in a patriarchal society's focus begins with man and woman. The male testosterone hormone is, for instance, known to greatly enhance risk taking behaviour; which can generate increased status in groups if successful (balanced with an equal increase in number of failures, with potential losses of status or death as result). The potential magnitude, frequency and longevity of the increased status from a hormonally driven risk-taking success depends on opportunities, which increases rapidly with societal complexity.\n\nA hypothetical patriarchal culture based primarily on a hormonally-driven increased rate of male successes, thus require a certain critical level of societal evolution before it could evolve. Other proponents of this theory posit that because of a woman's biology, she is more fit to perform roles such as anonymous child-rearing at home, rather than high-profile decision-making roles, such as leaders in battles. Through this simple basis, \"the existence of a sexual division of labor in primitive societies is a starting point as much for purely social accounts of the origins of patriarchy as for biological.\" Hence, the rise of patriarchy is recognized through this apparent \"sexual division\".\n\nAlthough patriarchy exists within the scientific atmosphere, \"the periods over which women would have been at a physiological disadvantage in participation in hunting through being at a late stage of pregnancy or early stage of child-rearing would have been short\", during the time of the nomads, patriarchy still grew with power. Lewontin and others argue that such biological determinism unjustly limits women. In his study, he states women behave a certain way not because they are biologically inclined to, but rather because they are judged by \"how well they conform to the stereotypical local image of femininity\".\n\nFeminists believe that people have gendered biases, which are perpetuated and enforced across generations by those who benefit from them. For instance, it has historically been claimed that women cannot make rational decisions during their menstrual periods. This claim cloaks the fact that men also have periods of time where they can be aggressive and irrational; furthermore, unrelated effects of aging and similar medical problems are often blamed on menopause, amplifying its reputation. These biological traits and others specific to women, such as their ability to get pregnant, are often used against them as an attribute of weakness.\n\nA growing body of research has found key points of the biological argument to be groundless. For example, it was asserted for over a century that women were not as intellectually competent as men because they have slightly smaller brains on average. However, no substantiated significant difference in average intelligence has been found between the sexes. On the other hand, men have a greater variability in intelligence, and except in tests of reading comprehension, in tests of perceptual speed and associative memory, males typically outnumber females substantially among high-scoring individuals.\n\nFurthermore, no discrepancy in intelligence is assumed between men of different heights, even though on average taller men have been found to have slightly larger brains. Feminists assert that although women may excel in certain areas and men in others, women are just as competent as men. Therefore, through the growing power of the patriarchal system, a gender bias is created in the work force, leading to a situation in which \"men are more likely to be cabinet ministers or parliamentarians, business executives or tycoons, Nobel Prize-winning scientists or fellows of academies, doctors or airline pilots. [As for] [w]omen [they] are more likely to be secretaries, laboratory technicians, office cleaners, nurses, airline stewardesses, primary school teachers, or social workers.\"\n\nWithin the structure of a patriarchal society, patriarchal biases and values are more likely to be promoted in the educational system. Particularly in mathematical and scientific fields, boys are presumed to have more keen spatial abilities than girls, whereas girls are supposed to assume better linguistic skills. These stereotypical manifestations within educational institutions contract with the notions of differently gendered brains and a \"relationship between intelligence and brain size\". However, there is \"no correlation between skull capacity and hence brain weight and 'intellectual power'\", yet there is still a constant struggle of gender bias in science.\n\nSociologist Sylvia Walby has composed six overlapping structures that define patriarchy and that take different forms in different cultures and different times:\n\nSome sociobiologists, such as Steven Goldberg, argue that social behavior is primarily determined by genetics, and thus that patriarchy arises more as a result of inherent biology than social conditioning. Goldberg also contends that patriarchy is a universal feature of human culture. In 1973, Goldberg wrote, \"The ethnographic studies of every society that has ever been observed explicitly state that these feelings were present, there is literally no variation at all.\" Goldberg has critics among anthropologists. Concerning Goldberg's claims about the \"feelings of both men and women\", Eleanor Leacock countered in 1974 that the data on women's attitudes are \"sparse and contradictory\", and that the data on male attitudes about male–female relations are \"ambiguous\". Also, the effects of colonialism on the cultures represented in the studies were not considered.\n\nAn early theory in evolutionary psychology offered an explanation for the origin of patriarchy which starts with the view that females almost always invest more energy into producing offspring than males, and therefore in most species females are a limiting factor over which males will compete. This is sometimes referred to as Bateman's principle. It suggests females place the most important preference on males who control more resources that can help her and her offspring, which in turn causes an evolutionary pressure on males to be competitive with each other in order to gain resources and power. \n\nHowever, an alternative evolutionary theory has challenged this theory. Attachment Fertility Theory, based on attachment theory, observes that human infants are born with a level of helplessness unknown elsewhere in the animal kingdom and that father involvement is critical to human infant survival. Because the investment in offspring required by human males and females is nearly equal, they are proposed to have evolved sex-similar mating preferences (Mutual Mate Choice), that is, both men and women prefer caring, attractive, and successful partners.\n\nThe idea that patriarchy is natural has, however, come under attack from many sociologists, explaining that patriarchy evolved due to historical, rather than biological, conditions. In technologically simple societies, men's greater physical strength and women's common experience of pregnancy combined together to sustain patriarchy. Gradually, technological advances, especially industrial machinery, diminished the primacy of physical strength in everyday life. Similarly, contraception has given women control over their reproductive cycle.\n\nThere is considerable variation in the role that gender plays in human societies. The \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" states, \"The consensus among modern anthropologists and sociologists is that while many cultures bestow power preferentially on one sex or the other, matriarchal societies in this original, evolutionary sense have never existed.\" The masculinities scholar David Buchbinder suggests that Roland Barthes' description of the term \"ex-nomination\" (i.e. patriarchy as the 'norm' or common sense) is relevant, \"[f]or as long as patriarchy remained tacit as a key principle of experiencing gender difference and hence a dominant discourse in the organization of society, it was difficult to contest its power.\"\n\nAmong the Mosuo (a tiny society in the Yunnan Province in China), however, women exert greater power, authority, and control over decision-making. Other societies are matrilinear or matrilocal, primarily among indigenous tribal groups. Some hunter-gatherer groups have been characterized as largely egalitarian. Some anthropologists, such as Ciccodicola, have argued that patriarchy is a cultural universal.\nBarbara Smuts argues that patriarchy evolved in humans through conflict between the reproductive interests of males and the reproductive interests of females. She lists six ways that it emerged:\n\nWhile the term \"patriarchy\" often refers to male domination generally, another interpretation sees it as literally \"rule of the father\". So some people believe patriarchy does not refer simply to of male power over women, but the expression of power dependent on age as well as gender, such as by older men over women, children, and younger men. Some of these younger men may inherit and therefore have a stake in continuing these conventions. Others may rebel.\n\nThis psychoanalytic model is based upon revisions of Freud's description of the normally neurotic family using the analogy of the story of Oedipus. Those who fall outside the Oedipal triad of mother/father/child are less subject to male authority. \n\nThe operations of power in such cases are usually enacted unconsciously. All are subject, even fathers are bound by its strictures. It is represented in unspoken traditions and conventions performed in everyday behaviors, customs, and habits. The triangular relationship of a father, a mother and an inheriting eldest son frequently form the dynamic and emotional narratives of popular culture and are enacted performatively in rituals of courtship and marriage. They provide conceptual models for organising power relations in spheres that have nothing to do with the family, for example, politics and business.\n\nArguing from this standpoint, radical feminist Shulamith Firestone wrote in her 1970 \"The Dialectic of Sex\":\n\nMarx was on to something more profound than he knew when he observed that the family contained within itself in embryo all the antagonisms that later develop on a wide scale within the society and the state. For unless revolution uproots the basic social organisation, the biological family – the vinculum through which the psychology of power can always be smuggled – the tapeworm of exploitation will never be annihilated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Practitioners of process thinking focus on the present instead of past events or future outcomes, and believe that all actions one takes in life, regardless of how trivial they may seem, affect the desired outcome. The philosophy was popularized by American football coach Nick Saban.\n\nThe step-by-step mechanism of process thinking is a prominent part of cognitive behavioral thinking, which was developed by psychiatrist Aaron Beck. In the 1960s, Beck developed a therapy which relies on the idea that thoughts affect feelings, and that good mental habits are systematically built up one step at a time.\n\nNick Saban formulated process thinking as it pertains to American football with the help of psychiatry professor Lionel Rosen while Saban was the head coach at Michigan State University. Saban and Rosen broke down complicated tasks like football games—and entire seasons—down into smaller, more manageable pieces. Rosen emphasized that the average football play lasts only seven seconds so coaches and players should concentrate only on those seconds, take a rest between plays, then do it all over again.\n\nDuring his time with LSU, the Miami Dolphins, and later the University of Alabama, Saban refined this systematic approach and extended it to include all aspects of managing a football program, which he calls \"the process.\" A key element of Saban's process, often stylized \"The Process\", is clearly defined expectations for his players not only on the field, but also academically and personally (including a dress code), which are monitored year-round.\n\nNick Saban's Process featured in Ryan Holiday's \"The Obstacle Is the Way\", where it drew comparisons to Stoic philosophy.\n\nSaban has led his teams to numerous conference championships and six national championships, five of them with Alabama and one with LSU. Much of the credit for Saban's sustained success has been given to the Process.\n\nOther coaches, players and general managers such as Head Coach of the Chicago Bears John Fox, Texas A&M Aggies Football coach Jimbo Fisher and University of Texas head basketball coach Shaka Smart have also asked their teams to “follow the process.”\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8498755", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8498755", "title": "Radical translation", "text": "Radical translation\n\nRadical translation is a thought experiment in \"Word and Object\", a major philosophical work from American philosopher Willard Van Orman Quine. It is used as an introduction to his theory of the indeterminacy of translation, and specifically to prove the point of inscrutability of reference. Using this concept of radical translation, Quine paints a setting where a linguist discovers a native linguistic community whose linguistic system is completely unrelated to any language familiar to the linguist. Quine then describes the steps taken by the linguist in his attempt to fully translate this unfamiliar language based on the only data he has; the events happening around him combined with the verbal and non-verbal behaviour of natives.\n\nAs a first step, the linguist will use direct translation on occasion sentences. Hearing a lot of utterances of the one-word-sentence 'Gavagai' whenever the linguist sees rabbits, he suspects the one-word-sentence 'Rabbit' to be the correct translation and starts a process of questioning and pointing until he is reasonably certain that the native has the verbal disposition to assent to 'Gavagai' if seeing the stimulus, a rabbit. This stimulus is the affirmative stimulus meaning of 'Gavagai', and the linguist can conclude this is a correct translation.\n\nThe translation of occasion sentences may be complicated through collateral information. A native, with full expertise of his surroundings, may already assent to 'Gavagai' when not even seeing a rabbit, but is sufficiently satisfied to assent when spotting a specific rabbit-fly that only flies around rabbits. The linguist on the other hand has no such expertise, and will wonder why his hypothesis seems off. \nCollateral information can also create a difference of stimulus meaning between members of the same language community. To solve this issue, the linguist will determine intrasubjective stimulus synonymy, enabling him to pair non-observational occasion sentences such as 'Bachelor' and 'Unmarried man'. While they may differ in stimulus meaning between various speakers, they are stimulus synonymous for the entire language community.\n\nIt is also possible for the linguist to determine stimulus analytic sentences, to which the native will assent given any (or no) stimulus. Social analytic sentences are sentences that are stimulus analytic for the entire language community.\n\nSo far the linguist has taken his first steps in the creation of a translation manual. However, he has no idea if the term 'gavagai' is actually synonymous to the term 'rabbit', as it is just as plausible to translate it as 'one second rabbit stage', 'undetached rabbit part', 'the spatial whole of all rabbits', or 'rabbithood'.\nTo question these differences, the linguist now has to translate words and logical particles.\n\nStarting off with the easiest task, to translate logical connectives, he formulates questions where he pairs logical connectives with occasion sentences and going through several rounds of writing down the assent or dissent to these questions from the natives to establish a translation. Any further translation of logical particles is however impossible, as translation of categorical statements (for example) relies on the translation of words, which in turn relies on the translation of categorical statements.\n\nAs it appears impossible to determine a unique correct translation of 'gavagai' caused by the limits of translation, the linguist can take any of the mentioned possibilities and have it correspond to the stimulus meaning through adaption of the logical connectives. This implies there is no matter of fact to which the word refers.\nAn example is to take the sentence 'Gavagai xyz gavagai', of which the linguist assumes it translates to 'This rabbit is the same as this rabbit', and to which the native assents. Now, when 'gavagai' is taken as 'undetached rabbit part' and 'xyz' as 'is part of the same animal as', the sentence 'This undetached rabbit part is part of the same animal as this undetached rabbit part', to which the native would also assent. Both sentences have the same stimulus meaning and truth condition. It therefore is impossible to derive the (object of) reference of the term 'gavagai' from the verbal disposition of the native.\n\nSo far the linguist has been able to\n(1) Translate observational sentences\n(2) Translate truth functions\n(3) Recognize stimulus analytic sentences\n(4) Recognize intrasubjective stimulus synonymous sentences\nTo go beyond the limits of translation by stimulus meaning, the linguist uses analytical hypotheses, where he hypothetically equates parts of native sentences to parts of sentences in his own language. Using this, he can now form new sentences and can create a complete translation manual by trial and error through the use of these sentences and adaption of his analytical hypotheses where needed.\n\nThe whole of analytical hypotheses cannot be evaluated as true or false, as they are predictions that can only be judged within their own system. As a result, all translation is fundamentally undetermined (and not just underdetermined). This indeterminacy is not meaningless, as it is it is possible to construct two separate translation manuals that are equally correct yet incompatible with each other due to having opposing truth values. A good translation is possible, but an objectively right translation of exact terms is impossible.\n\n"}

RID is the only organization in the United States that credentials both d/Deaf and Hearing interpreters to provide services in a wide range of settings, as well as test and certify interpreters for legal work. The RID Board is committed to the \"4 R's\" which are: Roots, Respect, Relevance and Results. As of 2014 there were over 15,000 members and 58 affiliate chapters. \n\nSince August 2004, RID has been building stronger ties with the National Association of the Deaf (NAD), including a joint Code of Professional Ethics and the merging of their respective certification programs. They jointly developed the National Interpreter Certification test (NIC), which was adopted in 2005.\n\nRID is headquartered in Alexandria, Virginia, with a roughly $3,000,000 annual budget and around 20 employees. The association's operations are led by an executive director (currently vacant) and governed by an eleven-member board of directors. \n\nRID is governed by an eleven-member board of directors elected directly by the voting membership for a two-year term. Voting rights are determined by being a member in good standing of both RID (in the certified or associate category) and a sanctioned affiliate chapter. The board is made up of the following positions: \nFollowing the expiration of the president's term, they serve an ex officio non-voting term on the board of directors as Immediate Past President. \n\nThe Executive Board consists of the President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, Member-at-Large, and Deaf Member-at-Large, and is elected on odd years for two-year terms. The regional representative positions are elected on even years for two-year terms. \n\nTo run for election to the Executive Board, members must collect 25 nomination signatures from voting members with at least one from each region of RID. Regional representative candidates must collect 25 nomination signatures from within their region. All positions except the Member-at Large require the candidate to be certified member of RID for four consecutive years prior to candidacy. Member-at-Large requires either associate or certified membership in RID for four consecutive years prior to candidacy. Additionally, regional representative candidates must have resided in their region at least two years prior to candidacy. If there are more than one candidates, an election is held via on-line balloting. p\n\nThe 2007–2018 board of directors are as follows:\n\nRID operations are conducted by a paid staff led by an Executive Director. Since 2014, RID has not had a permanent Executive Director following the departure of Shane Feldman. The board contracted with Anna Witter-Merithew who served as Interim Executive Director until August 2017. Since that time, the board has served as Executive Director through President Melvin Walker while continuing a permanent Executive Director search.\n\nAs part of their push to improve the ethical behavior of practitioners in the field, RID revised and updated existing guidelines from the Code of Ethics. In 2005, the Code of Professional Conduct was adopted as the newest set of principles interpreters should adhere to. Certified interpreters have an especially strong duty to follow the principles laid out by RID, for the integrity of the work, the well being of the stakeholders, and to avoid causing harm.\n\nThe tenets from the current Code of Professional Conduct are:\n\n\nRID has a national certification system with three key components: \n\n\nIn previous incarnations of the NTS, the following certifications were given to interpreters meeting the testing criteria (All credentials awarded by the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf will remain valid as long as the holder of said certification(s) maintains their membership and maintenance program.):\n\nPreviously offered certificates:\n\n\nCurrently offered certificates:\n\n\nRID granted certified membership to holders of the defunct NAD certification at levels III, IV and V as well as those who pass the Educational Interpreter Performance Assessment (EIPA) at proficiency level 4.0 with a passing score on the EIPA written exam. The certifications for these members are listed as:\nNo new certified member status is being granted for any of these categories. \n\nAs of July 2005, a new certification test, developed with the NAD, was implemented and the CI and CT tests began to be phased out. The new generalist certification for hearing interpreters is the NAD-RID National Interpreter Certification (NIC). In 2015 NAD decided to withdraw its involvement from the NIC resulting its name being removed from the test. \n\nRID formed a limited liability company called the Center for Assessment of Sign Language Interpretation (CASLI) in 2015 to carry out all testing functions. CASLI is a wholly owned subsidiary, supported operationally by RID headquarters staff and governed by a Managing Board that reports to the RID Board of Directors. As of 2017, the Board of Managers consisted of: \n\nIn 2017, CASLI's operations began direct supervision by Star Grieser, CDI who reports to the RID Deputy Director. \n\nCASLI's formation began a clearer philosophical and practical split of certification from professional testing. Under this new scheme, CASLI is granted greater autonomy to design, prepare and conduct generalist testing for both Deaf and hearing interpreters. RID retains the function of certifying interpreters based on their testing results and other certification criteria. As such, the EPS and CMP systems remain under RID's direct control. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "324638", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=324638", "title": "Sabians", "text": "Sabians\n\nThe Sabians (; ' or ') of Middle Eastern tradition were a religious group mentioned three times in the Quran as a People of the Book, along with the Jews and the Christians. In the \"hadith\", they were described simply as converts to Islam. Interest in the identity and history of the group increased over time. Discussions and investigations of the Sabians began to appear in later Islamic literature. The Sabians were identified by early writers with the ancient Jewish Christian group the Elcesaites, and with gnostic groups such as the Hermeticists and the Mandaeans. Today, the Mandaeans are still widely identified as Sabians.\n\nThere has been much speculation as to the origins of the religious endonym from this practice. The Arabic root (), means to grow forth or rise out of. When said of a star it means to rise, which may explain the association with star-worshippers. When relating to a religion it means one who left his former religion and was even a title of Muhammad for not being part of his tribe's faith. From such a root and in the context of the Qurʼanic passages, it may refer to all people who leave their faiths, finding fault in them, but have yet to come to Islam, related to the Hanif. The word Sabians or \"\" is also said to be derived from the Aramaic root related to baptism, the neo-Mandaic is \".\" Judah Segal (1963) argued that the term \"Sābi'ūn\" derives from Shiva, a primary god of Hinduism.\n\nThe Qur'an briefly mentions the Sabians in three places, with hadith providing additional details as to who they were:\n\nThe Muslim scholar Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi (d. 786–787 CE), who was in Basra before his death, wrote: \"The Sabians believe they belong to the prophet Noah, they read Zabur, and their religion looks like Christianity.\" He also states that \"they worship the angels\". According to the Qur'an, the \"Zabur\", the second book of Abrahamic tradition, was given to King David of ancient Israel. Many modern scholars identify the \"Zabur\" as the Psalms. \n\nMost of what is known of the Sabians comes from ibn Wahshiyya's \"The Nabatean Agriculture\", translated in 904 CE from Syriac sources. The text discusses beliefs attributed to the Sabians, in particular that they were people who lived in Pre-Adamite times, that Adam had parents and that he came from India.\n\nOther classical Arabic sources include the \"Fihrist\" of ibn al-Nadim (c. 987), who mentions the \"Mogtasilah\" (\"Mughtasila\", or \"self-ablutionists\"), a sect of Sabians in southern Mesopotamia who counted El-Hasaih or al-Hasih (possibly Arabic for \"Elchasai\") as their founder. \n\nAl-Biruni (writing at the beginning of the eleventh century CE) said that the '\"real Sabians'\" were \"the remnants of the Jewish tribes who remained in Babylonia when the other tribes left it for Jerusalem in the days of Cyrus and Artaxerxes. According to E. S. Drower (1937) these remaining tribes ... adopted a system mixed up of Magism and Judaism.'\n\nAccording to Abu Yusuf Absha al-Qadi, Caliph al-Ma'mun of Baghdad in 830 CE stood with his army at the gates of Harran and questioned the Harranians about what protected religion they belonged to. As they were neither Muslim, Christian, Jewish or Magian, the caliph told them they were non-believers. He said they would have to become Muslims, or adherents of one of the other religions recognized by the Qur'an by the time he returned from his campaign against the Byzantines or he would kill them. The Harranians consulted with a lawyer, who suggested that they find their answer in the Qur'an II.59, which said that Sabians were tolerated. It was unknown what the sacred text intended by \"Sabian\" and so they took the name.\n\nThese newly dubbed Harranian Sabians acknowledged Hermes Trismegistus as their prophet and the \"Hermetica\" as their sacred text, being a group of Hermeticists. Validation of Hermes as a prophet comes from his identification as Idris (i.e. Enoch) in the Qur'an (19.57 and 21.85).\n\nHowever, this account of the Harranian Sabians does not fit with the existence of earlier records making reference to Sabians in Harran. Usamah ibn Ayd, writing before 770 CE (his year of death), already referred to a city of Sabians in the region where Harran lies. The jurist Abu Hanifa, who died in 767 CE, is recorded to have discussed the legal status of Harranian Sabians with two of his disciples.\n\nThe Harranian Sabians played a vital role in Baghdad and in the rest of the Arab world from 856 until about 1050; serving as the main source of ancient Greek philosophy and science as well as shaping intellectual life. The most prominent of the Harranian Sabians was Thābit ibn Qurra.\n\nThe Jewish scholar Maimonides (1125–1204) translated the book \"The Nabataean Agriculture\", which he considered an accurate record of the beliefs of the Sabians, who believed in idolatrous practices \"and other superstitions mentioned in the Nabatean Agriculture.\" He provided considerable detail about the Sabians in his \"Guide for the Perplexed\" (completed 1186–1190).\n\nHippolytus of Rome describes how Elchasai, founder of the Elcesaites, preached in Parthia to the \"Sobiai\". Academics agree that this is probably a reference to the Sabians. According to Daniel Chwolson (1856), they appear to have gravitated around the original pro-Jewish \"Hanputa\" or Elcesaites, from which the prophet Mani seceded. They are later identified as the pro-Torah \"Sampsaeans\".\n\nThe Sabians are also mentioned in the literature of the Bahá'í Faith. These references are generally brief, describing two groups of Sabians: those \"who worship idols in the name of the stars, who believed their religion derived from Seth and Idris\", and others \"who believed in the son of Zechariah (John the Baptist) and didn't accept the advent of the son of Mary (Jesus Christ)\". 'Abdu'l-Bahá briefly describes Seth as one of the \"sons of Adam\". Bahá'u'lláh in a Tablet identifies Idris with Hermes. He does not, however, specifically name Idris as the prophet of the Sabians.\n\nThe Syrian Christian, and later French Vice-Consul at Mosul, Nicolas Siouffi in his \"Études sur la religion des Soubbas ou Sabéens, leurs dogmes, leurs moeurs\" (Paris: Imprimerie Nationale, 1880) claimed to have identified 4,000 Sabians in the Soubbhas. Siouffi's work was well received by the Theosophist G. R. S. Mead, but scholars criticized the estimates and study.\n\n21st century scholars have possibly identified the Sabians as Mandaeans or Harranians. Jaakko Hämeen-Anttila (2002, 2006) notes that in the marsh areas of Southern Iraq, there was a continuous tradition of Mandaean religion, and that another pagan, or \"Sabian\", centre in the tenth-century Islamic world centred on Harran. These pagan \"Sabians\" are mentioned in the Nabataean corpus of Ibn Wahshiyya.\n\nA group of modern-day people based in Iraq call themselves Sabians and follow the teachings of John the Baptist. They are Mandaeans (or \"Sabian Mandaeans\"). They are more urban than other Mandaeans living in southern Iraq, which perhaps explains why they prefer to be called Sabians. Due to their faith, pacifism and lack of tribal ties, they have been vulnerable to violence since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and numbered fewer than 5,000 in 2007. They primarily live around Baghdad, where the last sheik resides who conducts services and baptisms. Many from the sect have moved from Baghdad to Kurdistan where it is safer.\n\n\n\nAbout Sabians:\n"}

To study software as an artifact, it draws upon methods and theory from the digital humanities and from computational perspectives on software. Methodologically, software studies usually differs from the approaches of computer science and software engineering, which concern themselves primarily with software in information theory and in practical application; however, these fields all share an emphasis on computer literacy, particularly in the areas of programming and source code. This emphasis on analyzing software sources and processes (rather than interfaces) often distinguishes software studies from new media studies, which is usually restricted to discussions of interfaces and observable effects.\n\nThe conceptual origins of software studies include Marshall McLuhan's focus on the role of media in themselves, rather than the content of media platforms, in shaping culture. Early references to the study of software as a cultural practice appear in Friedrich Kittler's essay, \"Es gibt keine Software,\" Lev Manovich's \"Language of New Media\", and Matthew Fuller's \"Behind the Blip: Essays on the culture of software\". Much of the impetus for the development of software studies has come from videogame studies, particularly platform studies, the study of videogames and other software artifacts in their hardware and software contexts.

{"id": "832188", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=832188", "title": "Structural violence", "text": "Structural violence\n\nStructural violence is a term commonly ascribed to Johan Galtung, which he introduced in the article \"Violence, Peace, and Peace Research\" (1969). It refers to a form of violence wherein some social structure or social institution may harm people by preventing them from meeting their basic needs. Institutionalized adultism, ageism, classism, elitism, ethnocentrism, nationalism, speciesism, racism, and sexism are some examples of structural violence as proposed by Galtung. According to Galtung, rather than conveying a physical image, structural violence is an \"avoidable impairment of fundamental human needs\". As it is avoidable, structural violence is a high cause of premature death and unnecessary disability. Because structural violence affects people differently in various social structures, it is very closely linked to social injustice. Structural violence and direct violence are said to be highly interdependent, including family violence, gender violence, hate crimes, racial violence, police violence, state violence, terrorism, and war.\n\nIn his book \"Violence: Reflections on a National Epidemic\", James Gilligan defines structural violence as \"the increased rates of death and disability suffered by those who occupy the bottom rungs of society, as contrasted with the relatively lower death rates experienced by those who are above them\". Gilligan largely describes these \"excess deaths\" as \"non-natural\" and attributes them to the stress, shame, discrimination, and denigration that results from lower status. He draws on Sennett and Cobb, who examine the \"contest for dignity\" in a context of dramatic inequality.\n\nBandy X Lee wrote in her article \"Causes and cures VII: Structural violence,\" \"It refers to the avoidable limitations society places on groups of people that constrain them from achieving the quality of life that would have otherwise been possible. These limitations could be political, economic, religious, cultural, or legal in nature and usually originate in institutions that have authority over particular subjects.\" She goes on to say that it \"directly illustrates a power system wherein social structures or institutions cause harm to people in a way that results in maldevelopment or deprivation\". Rather than the term being called social injustice or oppression, there is an advocacy for it to be called violence because this phenomenon comes from, and can be corrected by human decisions, rather than just natural causes.\n\nIn \"The Sources of Social Power\", Michael Mann makes the argument that within state formation, \"increased organizational power is a trade-off, whereby the individual obtains more security and food in exchange for his or her freedom.\" Siniša Malešević elaborates on Mann's argument by saying, \"Mann's point needs extending to cover all social organizations, not just the state. The early chiefdoms were not states, obviously; still, they were established on a similar basis—an inversely proportional relationship between security and resources, on the one hand, and liberty, on the other.\" This means that although those who live in organized, centralized social systems are not likely subject to hunger or to die in an animal attack, they are likely to engage in organized violence, which could include war. These structures make for opportunities and advances that humans could not create for themselves, including the development of agriculture, technology, philosophy, science, and art; however, these structures take tolls elsewhere, meaning that these structures are both productive and detrimental. In our early history, hunter-gather groups used organizational power to acquire more resources and produce more food, but at the same time, this power was also used to dominate, kill, and enslave other groups in order to expand territory and supplies.\n\nAlthough structural violence is said to be invisible, it has a number of influences which shape it. These include identifiable institutions, relationships, force fields, and ideologies, including discriminatory laws, gender inequality, and racism. Moreover, this does not only exist for those of the lower class, although the effects are much heavier on them, including the highest rate of disease and death, unemployment, homelessness, lack of education, powerlessness, and shared fate of miseries. The whole social order is effected by social power, but these other groups have much more indirect effects on them, with the acts generally being less violent.\n\nDue to the social and economic structure in place today, specifically the division into rich and poor, powerful and weak, and superior and inferior, the death rate is between 10 and 20 million per year, which is about ten times the death rates from suicide, homicide, and warfare combined.\n\n\"Cultural violence\" refers to aspects of a culture that can be used to justify or legitimize direct or structural violence, and may be exemplified by religion and ideology, language and art, empirical science and formal science.\n\nCultural violence makes direct and structural violence look or feel \"right\", or at least not wrong, according to Galtung. The study of cultural violence highlights the ways the act of direct violence and the fact of structural violence are legitimized and thus made acceptable in society. One mechanism of cultural violence is to change the \"moral color\" of an act from \"red/wrong\" to \"green/right\", or at least to \"yellow/acceptable\".\n\nPetra Kelly wrote in her first book, \"Fighting for Hope\" (1984):\n\nThe violence in structural violence is attributed to the specific organizations of society that injure or harm individuals or masses of individuals. In explaining his point of view on how structural violence affects the health of subaltern or marginalized people, medical anthropologist Paul Farmer writes:\n\nThis perspective has been continually discussed by Paul Farmer, as well as by Philippe Bourgois and Nancy Scheper-Hughes.\n\nTheorists argue that structural violence is embedded in the current world system; this form of violence, which is centered on apparently inequitable social arrangements, is not inevitable. Ending the global problem of structural violence will require actions that may seem unfeasible in the short term. To some, this indicates that it may be easier to devote resources to minimizing the harmful impacts of structural violence. Others, such as futurist Wendell Bell, see a need for long-term vision to guide projects for social justice. Many structural violences, such as racism and sexism, have become such a common occurrence in society that they appear almost invisible. Despite this fact, sexism and racism have been the focus of intense cultural and political resistance for many decades. Significant reform has been accomplished, though the project remains incomplete.\n\nPaul Farmer notes that there are three reasons why structural violence is hard to see. \n\n1. Suffering is exoticized--that is, when something/someone is distant or far away, individuals tend to not be affected by it. When suffering lacks proximity, it's easy to exoticise. \n2. The weight of suffering is also impossible to comprehend. There is simply no way that many individuals are able to comprehend what suffering is like. \n3. Lastly, the dynamics and distribution of suffering are still poorly understood. \n\nStructural violence affects the availability of health care in the sense that physicians often need to pay attention to broad social forces (racism, gender inequality, classism, etc.) to determine who falls ill and who will be given access to care. It is more likely for structural violence to occur in areas where biosocial methods are neglected in a country's health care system. Since structurally violent situations are viewed primarily as biological consequences, it neglects environmentally stimulated problems, such as negative social behaviours or inequality prominence. If biosocial understandings are forsaken when considering communicable diseases such as HIV, for example, prevention methods and treatment practices become inadequate and unsustainable for populations. However, the challenge is obvious: many countries cannot afford to stop the harmful cycle of structural violence. Paul Farmer argues that the major flaw in the dominant model of medical care is that medical services are sold as a commodity, remaining only available to those who can afford them. The concept of structural violence is used to show how medical professionals are not trained to understand the social forces behind disease, nor are they trained to deal with or alter them. Medical professionals have to ignore the social determinants that alter access to care, and as a result, medical interventions are significantly less effective in low-income countries. Structural violence is an issue not only in developing countries, but also in North America. For example, it has had a significant impact on diagnosis and treatment of AIDS in the United States. A 1990 study by Moore et al. found that blacks had a significantly lesser chance of receiving treatment than whites. Findings from another study suggest that the increased rate of workplace injury among undocumented Latino immigrants in the United States can be understood as an example of structural violence. Structural violence is the result of policy and social structures, and change can only be a product of altering the processes that encourage structural violence in the first place. Paul Farmer claims that \"structural interventions\" are one possible solution.\n\nCountries such as Haiti and Rwanda have implemented these interventions with positive outcomes. Examples include prohibiting the commodification of the citizen needs, such as health care, ensuring equitable access to effective therapies, and developing social safety nets. These initiatives increase citizen's social and economic rights, thus decreasing structural violence. However, for these structural interventions to be successful, medical professionals need to be capable of executing such tasks. Unfortunately, many of these professionals are not trained to perform structural interventions. Moreover, medical professionals continue to operate under conventional clinical intervention because physicians can rightly note that structural interventions are not their job. Therefore, the onus falls more on political and other experts to implement such structural changes. As noted, structural forces account for most if not all epidemic diseases (e.g., HIV). Medical professionals still continue to operate under the downstream phenomenon, with a focus is on individual lifestyle factors rather than general socio-economic, cultural, and environmental conditions. This paradigm obscures the structural impediments to changes because it tends to avoid the root causes that should be focused on. One response is to incorporate medical professionals and to acknowledge that such active structural interventions are necessary to address real public health issues.\n\nThe lessons that have been learned from successful examples of structural interventions in these countries are fundamental. Although health disparities resulting from social inequalities are possible to reduce, as long as health care is exchanged as a commodity, those without the power to purchase it will have less access to it. Biosocial research should be the main focus. Sociology can better explain the origin and spread of infectious diseases, such as HIV or AIDS. Research shows that the risk of HIV is highly affected by one's behavior and habits. Although some structural interventions can decrease premature morbidity and mortality, the social and historical determinants of the structural violence cannot be omitted. Although the interventions have enormous influence on economical and political aspects of international bodies, more interventions are needed to improve access.\n\nStructural violence also exists in the area of mental health, where systems are designed to ignore the lived experiences of people with mental illnesses when making decisions about services and funding without consulting with the ill, including those who are illiterate, cannot access computers, do not speak the dominant language, are homeless, are too unwell to fill out long formal surveys, or are in locked psychiatric and forensic wards. Online-only consultation may be inappropriate for people with a lived experience of mental illness. Structural violence is also apparent when consumers in developed countries die from preventable diseases 15–25 years earlier than do people without a lived experience of mental health.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5307518", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5307518", "title": "The Day After Tomorrow (TV special)", "text": "The Day After Tomorrow (TV special)\n\nThe Day After Tomorrow (also known as Into Infinity in the United Kingdom) is a 1975 British science-fiction television drama produced by Gerry Anderson between the first and second series of \"\". Written by Johnny Byrne and directed by Charles Crichton, it stars Brian Blessed, Joanna Dunham and Nick Tate and is narrated by Ed Bishop. \"The Day After Tomorrow\" first aired in December 1975 in the United States on NBC, as an episode of an occasional series of after school specials for children, \"Special Treat\". In the UK, it was broadcast on BBC1 as a TV special in December 1976 and December 1977; 37 years later, in November 2014, a revised version was broadcast on BBC Four. The plot of \"The Day After Tomorrow\" concerns the interstellar mission of \"Altares\", a science spacecraft of the future that can travel at the speed of light. From its initial destination of Alpha Centauri, the starship pushes deeper into space; there, her crew of three adults and two children encounter such phenomena as a meteor shower, a red giant and, finally, a black hole, which pulls the ship into another universe.\n\nOriginally commissioned to create a child-friendly introduction to Albert Einstein's special relativity theory in the form of an exciting action-adventure, Anderson and Byrne conceived \"The Day After Tomorrow\" as a television pilot for a potential series and gave it an alternative episode title of \"Into Infinity\". Ultimately, Anderson's limited budget prevented additional episodes from being made. With a cast and crew including veterans of earlier Anderson productions, filming on \"The Day After Tomorrow\" ran from July to September 1975; this comprised ten days of principal photography and six weeks of special effects shooting. The visuals of \"Space: 1999\" provided inspiration for both Martin Bower, who designed the scale model effects for the special, and production designer Reg Hill, who re-used set elements created for various episodes of that series to build the interiors of \"Altares\". Newcomer Derek Wadsworth collaborated with Steve Coe to compose the theme and incidental music.\n\nCritical reception to \"The Day After Tomorrow\" remains mixed. The model effects and music have been praised; however, commentators have been both favourable and unfavourable in their comparisons of the special's \"psychedelic\" images to the visual style employed by film director Stanley Kubrick. Although Byrne's scriptwriting has been described as \"lyrical\", and it has been suggested that \"The Day After Tomorrow\" contains homages to the 1960s TV series \"Lost in Space\", the plot has been criticised for a lack of suspense, which critics have generally attributed to the fact that the special is primarily a science education programme. Further criticism has been directed at the acting, with Martin Lev's performance attracting a particularly negative response. Author Douglas R. Mason's novelisation of the special remains unpublished, but a new novelisation by Gregory L Norris was released by Anderson Entertainment in September 2017.\n\nIn the future, the survival of human civilisation is increasingly threatened by rising pollution, environmental damage and the depletion of the Earth's natural resources. The narrator (Ed Bishop) introduces Space Station Delta and the \"lightship\" \"Altares\" – the latter of which is the first Earth spacecraft to \"harness the limitless power of the photon\", allowing it to travel at the speed of light: \"This could create the effects predicted by Einstein's Theory of Relativity – effects that could shrink the very fabric of space, distort time, and perhaps alter the structure of the universe as we understand it.\"\n\n\"Altares\" is due to leave Delta on a mission beyond the Solar System to seek out Earth-like planets for possible colonisation. Due to the effects of time dilation, by which astronauts travelling at near-light speed age far more slowly than people on Earth, the ship will be crewed by two whole \"family units\". Arriving in a United Nations shuttle, Doctors Tom and Anna Bowen (Brian Blessed and Joanna Dunham) board \"Altares\" with their son, David (Martin Lev). Meanwhile, Jane Masters (Katharine Levy) leaves her dog, Spring, in the care of station commander Jim Forbes (Don Fellows). Her father, Captain Harry Masters (Nick Tate), engages \"Altares\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"photon drive\" and the vessel starts its 4.3-light-year journey to the star Alpha Centauri, its first scheduled stop. As \"Altares\" nears the edge of the Solar System, Jane and David observe how Pluto appears to change colour from blue to red due to the shortening and lengthening of light waves caused by the Doppler effect. Arriving at Alpha Centauri, the crew launch a series of satellites to relay data back to Earth. Having completed their primary objective, the Masters and Bowen families then agree to push deeper into space.\n\nWhen \"Altares\" encounters a star cluster, Anna tells Jane of Einstein's accomplishments in the areas of special relativity and unified field theory. Shortly after, the ship is hit by a meteor shower that damages various systems and causes the photon drive to re-activate, hurling \"Altares\" through space at such velocity that the travellers are knocked out. A fail-safe brings the vessel, now powerless, to a halt within the gravitational field of a red giant on the brink of supernova. Donning a heat suit, Captain Masters risks his life by entering the reactor core in a bid to repair the drive. He succeeds, and Anna and Jane pilot the ship outside the blast radius of the star before it explodes.\n\nDetecting a signal from Delta, which has taken the equivalent of 15 Earth years to reach them, the travellers are able to plot their position and lay in a course home. However, disaster strikes when \"Altares\" is caught in the gravity of a black hole that has formed from a collapsed star. The photon drive is unable to provide the faster-than-light speeds necessary to break free; nevertheless, Anna urges the crew not to give up hope, for she suspects that the object may be a gateway to another universe. Her theory is proven correct when, sustaining the various space-time distortions at the event horizon, \"Altares\" safely emerges from the black hole – intact, albeit with no way of returning to Earth. As the vessel and its intrepid crew approach a planet, the narrator concludes, \"One thing is sure – this is not the final word. Not the end, but the beginning. A new universe, a new hope? Only time will tell.\"\n\nIn the spring of 1975, after filming on \"\" of \"\" had been completed, NBC agent George Heinemann contacted Group Three producer Gerry Anderson with an idea for a new science-fiction TV series. This would comprise seven one-hour episodes designed to teach children about scientific subjects in the format of an entertaining action-adventure. To publicise the series, NBC undertook to distribute information leaflets to schools. Heinemann hired Anderson to produce a TV special that would discuss, as its main topic, the physicist Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity, which holds that the speed of light cannot be exceeded and remains constant whether an object is still or in motion.\n\nBy 1975, Group Three Productions had received no assurance from its distributor, ITC Entertainment, that a second series of \"Space: 1999\" would be commissioned. With the possibility of cancellation looming, Anderson and his scriptwriter, \"Space: 1999\" script editor Johnny Byrne, conceived the special that would become \"The Day After Tomorrow\" as the pilot episode of a prospective new series. If successful, the pilot, titled \"Into Infinity\", would be followed by additional episodes – the series itself to be named \"The Day After Tomorrow\". Ultimately, Anderson was unsuccessful in securing the funding needed to make a full series, and \"The Day After Tomorrow\": \"Into Infinity\" remains a self-contained science-fiction drama.\n\nIn preparation for his work on the special, Anderson researched Einstein's achievements; in his authorised biography, he admitted that he did not understand any of the physicist's theories. Byrne's script directed that \"E\"=\"mc\" – the Einsteinian formula that relates mass to energy – appear on-screen at intervals. Of the ending, it commented that, \"it's a universe not only stranger than we imagine, but stranger than we \"can\" imagine.\" Although special relativity provides the main scientific and educational focus of the programme, \"The Day After Tomorrow\" also examines time dilation – an effect whereby time decelerates at a rate proportional to that of the acceleration of an object. For the crew of \"Altares\", a ship capable of travelling at the speed of light, the mission to Alpha Centauri is measured in years, while whole decades pass on Earth. To encourage children to explore the topics in their own time (and thereby develop their research skills), Byrne wrote the characters in such a way that they provide only partial explanations of special relativity and related subjects.\n\nMost of the cast of \"The Day After Tomorrow\" had appeared in or otherwise contributed to earlier Anderson productions. Nick Tate, who had appeared as the supporting character of Alan Carter in Year One of \"Space: 1999\", played the Captain of \"Altares\", Harry Masters. His contract awarded him third place in the credits. Brian Blessed and Joanna Dunham, starring as the husband-and-wife duo of Doctors Tom and Anna Bowen, and billed above Tate, had both appeared in guest roles – Blessed in the episode \"Death's Other Dominion\", Dunham in \"\".\n\nIn the role of Space Station Delta Commander Jim Forbes was Don Fellows, who had played an uncredited voice part in \"Space: 1999\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s first episode, \"\". Ed Bishop had voiced the character of Captain Blue in Anderson's late-1960s puppet series \"Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons\" before taking on in the lead role of Commander Ed Straker in the live-action \"UFO\". Neither Martin Lev nor Katherine Levy had any previous acting experience, although the filming of \"The Day After Tomorrow\" at Pinewood Studios coincided with that of Alan Parker's musical comedy \"Bugsy Malone\", in which Lev played the role of gangster Dandy Dan. Byrne's dog, Bones, appeared as the Masters' pet, Spring.\n\nPrincipal photography was conducted over ten days in July 1975 at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire on a budget of £105,000. The special effects sequences required a further six weeks' filming at Bray Studios in Berkshire; production ended in September. During the filming of \"Space: 1999\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"\", Group Three re-used a number of props from \"The Day After Tomorrow\" as a cost-saving measure. The production staff included several Anderson regulars who had contributed to the earlier series – among them effects director Brian Johnson, editor David Lane and cinematographer Frank Watts. Charles Crichton, whose credits included eight episodes of \"Space: 1999\", returned to direct \"The Day After Tomorrow\". As Barry Gray was busy with other commitments, the task of composing the theme music fell to newcomer Derek Wadsworth, who also collaborated with Steve Coe to produce the incidental music and would subsequently compose for Year Two of \"Space: 1999\". Professor John Taylor served as scientific adviser on the production.\n\nIn the absence of Bob Bell and Keith Wilson, who were working on \"The New Avengers\" and \"Star Maidens\", the role of production designer was taken up by Reg Hill. The set designs for the \"Altares\" interiors were the first that Hill had presented to Anderson since the making of the Supermarionation series \"Fireball XL5\" in 1961. To realise Hill's concepts, the production team adapted parts of the \"Ultra Probe\" set created for the \"Space: 1999\" episode \"Dragon's Domain\", along with various set elements that had appeared in other episodes. Working on the mistaken assumption that his commissions were to appear in \"Space: 1999\", uncredited effects technician Martin Bower took inspiration from the appearance of spaceships featured in the earlier series in designing and building scale models of the lightship \"Altares\". A small, model appears in long shots; a larger, version, fitted with gas-powered rocket jets to simulate exhaust and a high-powered light to represent the photon drive, was used for close-ups. To construct the model of Space Station Delta, Bower revamped the \"SS Daria\" prop first seen in \"\". The United Nations shuttle model was long.\n\nIn the United States, \"The Day After Tomorrow\" aired on 9 December 1975 on NBC as the third episode of \"Special Treat\". In the United Kingdom, it was first broadcast on 11 December 1976 on BBC1.\n\nFearing that the use of both the \"Day After Tomorrow\" and \"Into Infinity\" titles would confuse British audiences (as \"The Day After Tomorrow\" was to air not as a pilot, but as a special on UK television), the BBC edited the opening titles to delete the former. In any case, the removal of the episode title, \"Into Infinity\", would have been more difficult; while the series title appears against a simple starfield, the episode title is superimposed on a moving model shot of the lift that transfers the Bowen and Masters families from Space Station Delta to \"Altares\" during the programme's opening scenes. Consequently, \"The Day After Tomorrow\" was listed in \"Radio Times\" magazine and other British media exclusively under the title of \"Into Infinity\".\n\n\"The Day After Tomorrow\" had its first UK repeat on BBC1 on 6 December 1977. In 1997, the BBC deleted the master tape from its archives but retained an edited copy for possible future repeats. Clips of \"The Day After Tomorrow\" (as well as the \"Space: 1999\" episode \"Black Sun\") were featured in \"Black Holes\", a 1997 edition of the Channel 4 documentary series \"Equinox\".\n\nUnder the title of \"The Day after Tomorrow: Into Infinity\", a new version was screened in the UK on 9 November 2014 on BBC Four. This revised version (with edited end credits to facilitate the inclusion of the Anderson Entertainment logo) was introduced by Professor Brian Cox of the University of Manchester, who stated that he had been a fan of \"The Day after Tomorrow\" since childhood and praised the programme for its scientific accuracy.\n\nChris Bentley, author of \"The Complete Gerry Anderson: The Authorised Episode Guide\", notes similarities between \"The Day After Tomorrow\" and the \"Fireball XL5\" episode \"Faster Than Light\", whose plot concerns the problems encountered by the crew of spacecraft when it accelerates to light speed. Elizabeth Howell, a science journalist, argues that the programme is remarkable for its depiction of space exploration \"in the colonisation sense, rather than \"Star Wars\" and its descendants who show space as a spot to be conquered.\" She comments further that the themes are \"strangely timeless ... the true, unknown part hits you at the very end.\" In a review published in \"TV Zone\" magazine in 2002, Andrew Pixley praised the acting, music and direction in general, writing that the film \"oozes with the charm associated with the golden era of Anderson.\" However, criticising other aspects, he argued that \"it is the fundamental concept that falls flat. Rather than making physics a palatable piece of escapist hokum, the format is dragged down to the level of a scantily-illustrated physics textbook ... something isn't quite right.\"\n\nVincent Law, in a review published in the Gerry Anderson-centric fanzine \"Andersonic\", considers \"The Day After Tomorrow\" an \"oddity\" and an \"uncharacteristically lacklustre entry in the Anderson canon\", commenting that the programme \"cracks along at a fair old pace, but the educational content does tend to deaden the first half of the story and limits the room for character development.\" Although he credits the production for \"getting its science lesson across in a superficial way\", he expresses a negative view of the narration, remarking that \"at times Ed [Bishop] comes across like a presenter of one of those old schools programmes from the 70s, just imparting a string of dry facts.\" He believes that Jane is the only character who develops over the course of the special. The adults, by contrast, are \"pretty much peripheral\", while David can be considered a \"miniature Spock\" who \"lurks around the ship either brandishing his slide rule, threatening to calculate something, or staring out of the porthole (a nice touch!) dribbling about pulsars.\"\n\nLaw believes that the general standard of production design and special effects is lower than that of \"\", expressing satisfaction with the scale models but suggesting that \"the slow-motion filming and wobbly mirror effects are more in keeping with \"Blake's 7\".\" He views the \"info dump\" opening titles as a weak imitation of the \"Space: 1999\" introduction, and the multiple appearances of the \"E\"=\"mc\" equation as confusing. Certain props (such as the slide rule) and design elements (such as punched cards) also come under criticism from Law, who questions whether a futuristic \"lightship\" would be equipped with such relatively primitive technology. Although he suggests that the plot device of the accident-prone \"Altares\" reflects the shifting public perception of space exploration in the 1970s (\"a time when optimism in the space programme was on the wane\"), Law regards such design elements as indicative of the manner in which \"The Day After Tomorrow\" \"has stood the test of time less well than other series.\"\n\nCommenting on his online blog, literary critic John Kenneth Muir praises Johnny Byrne's \"lyrical\" scriptwriting, judges Brian Johnson's effects to be \"top-notch for the era\", and deems Frank Watts' filming \"stunning\". For Muir, the message of the special implies a \"high-tech, science-minded update of the whole \"Lost in Space\" format\", while the plot effectively mixes elements of the \"claustrophobic\" and \"action-packed\" with \"psychedelic\" elements such as the descent into the black hole, a subject on which he alludes to the work of Stanley Kubrick: the sequence is \"a Kubrickian wonder, a montage dominated by double images, slow-motion photography and the use of a creepy distortion lens. Pretty powerful stuff for a kids' show.\" Law, meanwhile, considers the faster-than-light shots to be the special's best effects, and compares the black hole sequence unfavourably to the closing act of Kubrick's 1968 film \"\": \"Kubrick's Star-Gate it is not.\"\n\nArguing that \"The Day After Tomorrow\" is \"kinda like Kubrick's \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" ... for kids\", science-fiction writer and reviewer Christopher Mills expresses disappointment with the effect of the black hole itself, but describes the fall into the anomaly as \"very colourful\". However, in contrast with Muir, he views the sequences set inside \"Altares\" during the descent as \"a bit of a hoot\", directing particular criticism at the actors' exaggerated gesticulations. Commenting that the plot contains \"plenty of wonky pseudo-science and insanely improbable coincidences\", Mills also recalls his fascination at \"how 'British' ... the characters [are], facing each new peril with remarkable calm and 'stiff upper lip' stoicism. By the time they're caught in the clutches of the ominous black hole, they're apparently so resigned to being jerked around by the universe that they just hold hands and calmly await their fate.\"\n\nMuir suggests that the feel of \"The Day After Tomorrow\" is \"a little more colourful (less minimalist) in colour and costume than \"Space: 1999\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s sterling \", with such elements as Wadsworth's \"hard-hitting, hard-driving musical score\" livening up the proceedings. The music has also received praise from Law, who notes a \"dynamic pace\", as well as Anderson himself. Muir summarises the final product as a \"Year One-style 'awe and mystery of space' narrative, but one conveyed in the more colourful-looking or -sounding fashion\", and a \"time capsule of once-state-of-the-art science fiction\". To Law, it is \"half-forgotten experiment which is now perhaps only of interest to aficionados\", but \"an interesting look at what might have been\" if Anderson had been able to produce a full series. Mills interprets it as a \"solid little piece of 70s juvenile sci-fi\" that is perhaps \"not quite as 'scientifically accurate' as it pretends to be, but fun\".\n\nIn 1997, the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) awarded \"The Day After Tomorrow\" a U certificate. Licensed releases of \"The Day After Tomorrow\" are available in a compilation DVD set entitled 'The Lost Worlds of Gerry Anderson' which is available in the UK and Australia/New Zealand.\n\nScience-fiction writer Douglas R. Mason, an author of several \"\" novels, wrote a novelisation of Johnny Byrne's script for \"The Day After Tomorrow\". Mason's publisher, Futurama Publications, had originally intended to release additional books, since Anderson had conceived \"The Day After Tomorrow\" as the pilot episode for a prospective TV series. When Anderson abandoned this idea, Futurama cancelled Mason's novelisation, which currently remains unpublished. However a 2017 novelisation of the story by Gregory L Norris was released by Anderson Entertainment in September 2017.\n\nBibliography\n\n\n"}

It was directed and produced by John Frankenheimer. The screenplay was written by George Axelrod, and was based on the 1959 Richard Condon novel \"The Manchurian Candidate\". The film's leading actors are Frank Sinatra, Laurence Harvey and Janet Leigh, with Angela Lansbury, Henry Silva, and James Gregory among the performers cast in the supporting roles. \n\nThe plot centers on the Korean War veteran Raymond Shaw, the progeny of a prominent political family. Shaw was a prisoner of war during the conflict in Korea and while being held was brainwashed by his captors. After his discharge back into civilian life, he becomes an unwitting assassin involved in an international communist conspiracy. Officials from China and the Soviet Union employ Shaw as a sleeper agent in an attempt to subvert and take over the United States government.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on October 24, 1962, at the height of U.S.-Soviet hostility during the Cuban Missile Crisis. It was well-received by critics and was nominated for two Academy Awards: Best Supporting Actress (Lansbury) and Best Editing. It was selected in 1994 for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\n\nDuring the Korean War, the Soviets capture a U.S. platoon and take it to Manchuria in communist China. Three days later, all but two of the soldiers return to the U.S. lines and Staff Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey) is credited by the survivors with saving their lives in combat. Upon recommendation of the platoon's commander, Captain Bennett Marco (Frank Sinatra), Shaw is awarded the Medal of Honor. He returns stateside to a hero's welcome, exploited by his mother, Mrs. Eleanor Iselin (Angela Lansbury), on behalf of the political career of her husband and Shaw's stepfather, United States Senator John Yerkes Iselin (James Gregory). When asked to describe him, Marco and the other soldiers automatically respond, \"Raymond Shaw is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I've ever known in my life.\", even though Shaw is a cold, sad, unsympathetic loner.\n\nIn the years to follow, Marco, who has since been promoted to major and assigned to Army Intelligence, suffers from a recurring nightmare. In it, a hypnotized Shaw blithely and brutally murders the two missing soldiers before an assembly of military leaders from the communist nations, during a practical demonstration of a revolutionary brainwashing technique. Marco is compelled to investigate, but with no solid evidence to back his claims fails to receive support from his uplines. However, Marco learns that another soldier from the platoon, Allen Melvin (James Edwards), has had the same nightmare. When Melvin and Marco separately identify the identical two men from their dreams as leading figures in communist governments, Army Intelligence agrees to help Marco investigate.\n\nMeanwhile, Eleanor drives the ascension of Iselin, a McCarthy-like demagogue stirring domestic turmoil and climbing the political ladder based on claims that varying numbers of communists work within the Department of Defense. Shaw, who broke with the couple immediately upon his return to America, is gradually revealed to have had been programmed by Russian and Chinese communists to be a sleeper agent who will blindly obey orders without any memory of his actions. His heroism was a false memory implanted in the platoon during their brainwashing in Manchuria. His programming is triggered by seeing the Queen of Diamonds card while playing solitaire after being induced by his handlers.\n\nSeveral years pass before Shaw finds happiness when he rekindles a youthful romance with Jocelyn Jordan (Leslie Parrish), the daughter of liberal Senator Thomas Jordan (John McGiver), one of his stepfather's political rivals. Mrs. Iselin had previously broken up the relationship, but now facilitates the couple's reunion in order to garner Jordan's support for Iselin's bid for Vice President. Although pleased with the match, Jordan makes it clear that he will block any effort of Iselin's to seek their party's nomination. Jocelyn, wearing a Queen of Diamonds costume at a party for her thrown by the Iselins, inadvertently triggers Shaw's programming and elopes with him. In response to the senator's rebuff, Mrs. Iselin, who is revealed to be Shaw's American handler, triggers him to kill Jordan at his home, shooting Jocelyn as well when she happens upon the scene. Afterwards, Shaw has no knowledge of his actions and is grief-stricken when he learns of the murders.\n\nEventually discovering the card's role in Shaw's conditioning, Marco uses a forced deck in an attempt to deprogram him and reveal his next assignment, which appears imminent. Mrs. Iselin primes her son to assassinate their party's presidential nominee at the height of the ongoing political convention so that Senator Iselin, as the vice-presidential candidate, will become the nominee by default. In the uproar, he will immediately seek emergency powers that when elected will, in Mrs. Iselin's words, \"make martial law seem like anarchy.\" Mrs. Iselin tells Shaw that while she had requested a programmed assassin for the task, she never knew it would be her own son, who was selected by the communists in order to bind her more closely to their cause. Kissing Shaw on the lips in a hint at the novel's incestuous relationship, she vows that once in power she will exact revenge for her son's selection as assassin.\n\nShaw enters the convention hall disguised as a priest and takes up a sniper's position high in its farthest reaches. Alarmed by Shaw's failure to call by the appointed time, Marco and his supervisor, Colonel Milt (Douglas Henderson), race to the hall to find and stop him. When the moment to shoot comes, Shaw, instead kills his mother and Senator Iselin. When Marco arrives an instant later, Shaw tells him he failed to call to prevent anyone from interfering with his change in plans. Shaw then fatally turns the rifle on himself.\n\n\n\n\nFor the role of Mrs. Iselin, Sinatra suggested Lucille Ball, but Frankenheimer, who had worked with Lansbury in \"All Fall Down\", countered with her, insisting Sinatra watch her in that film before a final choice was made. Although Lansbury played Raymond Shaw's mother, played by Laurence Harvey, she was in fact only three years older than Harvey. An early scene in which Shaw, recently decorated with the Medal of Honor, argues with his parents was filmed in Sinatra's own private plane.\n\nJanet Leigh plays Marco's love interest. In a short biography of Leigh broadcast on Turner Classic Movies, actress Jamie Lee Curtis reveals her mother had been served divorce papers on behalf of her father, actor Tony Curtis, the morning of the scene where she and Sinatra first meet on a train.\n\nIn a scene where Marco attempts to deprogram Shaw in a hotel room opposite the convention Sinatra is at times slightly out of focus. It was a first take, and Sinatra failed to be as effective in subsequent retakes, a common factor in his film performances. In the end, Frankenheimer elected to use the original. Critics subsequently praised him for showing Marco from Shaw's distorted point of view.\n\nIn the novel Mrs. Iselin had been sexually abused by her father as a child. Before the dramatic climax, she uses her son's brainwashing to have sex with him. Concerned with blowback over even a reference to such a taboo topic as incest in a mainstream motion picture of the time, the filmmakers instead opted for Mrs. Iselin to simply kiss Shaw on the lips to imply her incestuous attraction to him.\n\nNearly half of the film's production budget of $2.2 million went on Sinatra's salary for his performance.\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, \"The Manchurian Candidate\" holds an approval rating of 98% rating based on 54 reviews, with an average rating of 8.7/10. The website's critical consensus states, \"A classic blend of satire and political thriller that was uncomfortably prescient in its own time, \"The Manchurian Candidate\" remains distressingly relevant today.\" On Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, the film has a score of 94 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\n\nFilm critic Roger Ebert listed \"The Manchurian Candidate\" on his \"Great Movies\" list, declaring that it is \"inventive and frisky, takes enormous chances with the audience, and plays not like a 'classic' but as a work as alive and smart as when it was first released\".\n\nLansbury was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actress, and Ferris Webster was nominated for Best Film Editing. In addition Lansbury was named Best Supporting Actress by the National Board of Review and won the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nIn 1994 \"The Manchurian Candidate\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". The film ranked at No. 67 on the \"AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies\" when that list was first compiled in 1998, but a 2007 revised version excluded it. It was also No. 17 on AFI's \"AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills\" lists. In April 2007, Angela Lansbury's character was selected by \"Time\" as one of the 25 greatest villains in cinema history.\n\n\nAccording to rumor, Sinatra removed the film from distribution after the John F. Kennedy assassination on November 22, 1963. Michael Schlesinger, who was responsible for the film's 1988 reissue by MGM/UA, denies the rumor. According to him the film was not removed, but there was lack of public interest in it by 1963. \n\nSinatra's representatives acquired rights to the film in 1972 after the initial contract with United Artists expired. The film was broadcast on television in April 1974 on \"NBC Saturday Night at the Movies\". After a successful showing at the New York Film Festival in 1987 increased public interest in the film, the studio reacquired the rights and it became again available for theater and video releases.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1952253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1952253", "title": "Touhou Project", "text": "Touhou Project\n\nThe , also known as Toho Project or Project Shrine Maiden, is a series of Japanese bullet hell shooter video games developed by the single-person Team Shanghai Alice. Team Shanghai Alice's sole member, ZUN, independently produces the games' graphics, music, and programming.\n\nPlots in the \"Touhou Project\" games revolve around the strange phenomena occurring in Gensokyo, a fictional realm inhabited by humans and \"yōkai\", supernatural beings. Prior to the events of the games, Gensokyo was sealed off from the outside world by a magical barrier. The main protagonist of the series, Reimu Hakurei, is a shrine maiden who manages the border, fighting antagonistic \"yōkai\". The first five games were produced for the Japanese NEC PC-9801 computer series; bullet hell mechanics were introduced in the second game, \"Story of Eastern Wonderland\". \"The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil\", released in August 2002, marked a shift to the Microsoft Windows platform, bringing the games to a larger audience. Several sequels followed, including spin-off fighting games that diverged from the series' traditional mechanics.\n\nThe series was inducted into the Guinness World Records in October 2010 for being the \"most prolific fan-made shooter series\". The \"Touhou Project\" has spawned a media franchise including commercial fan books, music, light novels, manga, and several fanmade anime in addition to the main series.\n\nThe \"Touhou\" series of games started on the Japanese PC-98 series of computers and its first five entries are native to that platform; standard PC users are only capable of playing them through an emulator. Also, the PC-9801 series of computers was already on the decline when these games were released. Because of this, they are not well known among players. The group that published these games was called Amusement Makers.\n\nAfter \"Mystic Square\", the \"Touhou Project\" became inactive for four years while its creator ZUN began to develop several music scores for the \"Seihou\" games. He then left the group and made \"Touhou\" games for Windows under his own group, Team Shanghai Alice. The playability of the Windows games was substantially improved compared to that of the PC-98 counterparts. Most \"dōjin\" works derived from the \"Touhou\" series are centered on these games.\n\nIn addition to dōjin games, Team Shanghai Alice has also expanded the \"Touhou\" universe into other media.\n\nTen music albums have been released by ZUN, each containing rearranged versions of music from the games, in addition to original tracks. These albums are , , , , , (5.5th), , , and . Each CD also comes with a bonus story about except the first and the 5.5th one.\n\nThere is also a five-volume set of soundtracks containing music from the PC-98 \"Touhou\" games titled , in addition to original game soundtracks for \"Immaterial and Missing Power\", \"Scarlet Weather Rhapsody\", \"Touhou Hisōtensoku\", \"Hopeless Masquerade\" and \"Urban Legend in Limbo\". Some of the official print media released include music CDs containing original tracks and rearranges of earlier music.\n\nIn the shooting games, the player's bullet power increases on a linear scale as the player collects power-ups dropped by enemies, and eventually maxes out. The player can also collect 'point' icons to earn extra lives; the amount needed grows exponentially as the player's score rises. The player can use 'focus', the shift key by default, which slows down the player's movement, makes the collision box visible, and (generally; some characters are reversed) focuses the player's attack to make it more powerful. The graze counter, missing from \"Mountain of Faith\" and \"Story of Eastern Wonderland\", tracks how many bullets entered the character sprite but avoided the collision box, and rewards the player with a score bonus for living on the edge.\n\nThe player can use a weapon called a 'spell card', which is similar to a 'bomb' in most other shooting games. While the player has a limited number, using one makes the user temporarily invulnerable and uses a special magical attack that generally clears the screen. Each character has two cards with different names and patterns. The player can use one during a short period after being hit by a bullet (known as the 'border between life and death') to avoid loss of a life. The amount of time the player has available to use the border is usually around 0.3 seconds. Bosses also have spell cards, but with bosses the term applies to a prolonged pattern of movements and shots that lasts until the player depletes the boss' health by a certain amount or the time runs out, not a one-shot attack.\n\nEach individual game of the main series from \"Perfect Cherry Blossom\" to \"Ten Desires\" has additional items that affect some aspect of gameplay, such as scoring or gaining extra lives/bombs. For example, \"Perfect Cherry Blossom\" has \"cherry points\", which are used mostly in scoring, but can grant temporary invulnerability (known as 'supernatural border'); \"Imperishable Night\" has \"time points\", which are essential for advancing to later stages, and also determine if the player gets to challenge a boss's 'final spell' on normal or higher difficulties; \"Mountain of Faith\" has 'faith' points, which boost the score the player receives upon gathering point items and bonuses for clearing spell cards without dying or using a spell card.\n\nEach \"Touhou\" game has four difficulty levels—easy, normal, hard, and lunatic—with each one being harder than the previous one. Regardless of difficulty choice, there are six stages in each game and each one is harder than the previous. The only exceptions to this are \"Story of Eastern Wonderland\", and \"Embodiment of Scarlet Devil\" on easy difficulty, both of which only have five stages.\n\nIn addition to the four main difficulties, there is an extra stage which is a long and difficult stage in which players must play through hordes of enemies, and an especially long boss fight (usually with ten spell cards). In order to reach the extra stage, one must beat the game on normal difficulty or higher without the use of a continue. The only games that allow players to reach the extra stage by completing the easy difficulty are \"Story of Eastern Wonderland\", \"Mystic Square\", \"Perfect Cherry Blossom\", \"Imperishable Night\", \"Fairy Wars\", \"Double Dealing Character\", and \"Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom\". In terms of difficulty, the extra stage is around the normal difficulty level or above. In \"Perfect Cherry Blossom\", there is also a phantasm extra stage in which the enemies that were already difficult in the extra stage have become even more challenging. Although the phantasm stage is aimed for the most experienced players, the difficulty is somewhere in between hard and lunatic. The phantasm stage is accessed by beating the extra stage and capturing at least 60 spells with any of the characters and weapon types combined.\n\nThe plots of the \"Touhou Project\" revolve around the strange phenomena that occur in the fictional realm of , which ZUN designed with a human village in the grounds of some remote mountain recesses in Japan. Originally, it was simply called \"a remote separated land of a human village in an eastern country.\" Long before Touhou Project's story begins, there lived many non-humans like \"yōkai\" as well as some humans in the area. After a few humans lost their way into Gensokyo, humans became afraid of approaching this area, although others settled here for the sake of yōkai extermination. However, as time went on, humans developed civilization and multiplied in number, and thus the yōkai became distressed about how this would affect the balance between humans and yōkai. Thus, 500 years before \"The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil\" (EoSD), the yōkai sage Yukari Yakumo developed the \"boundary of phantasm and substance,\" which was favored by the yōkai and protected the balance. This was called the \"Yōkai Expansion Project\" and made Gensokyo a phantasmal world that automatically called out to the weakened yōkai of the outside world. Other things that disappear from the outside world, like extinct animals, lost tools, and architecture, also became abundant in Gensokyo. Since Gensokyo was a plot of land in Japan that was separated by a barrier, it is Japan that is immediately outside of this barrier.\n\nAs a result of the seal, Gensokyo became inaccessible from the outside world, and similarly, those in Gensokyo were unable to leave. Gensokyo's existence could not be confirmed from the outside world, nor could the outside world be confirmed within Gensokyo. As a result, the isolated community developed its own civilization, different from that of the outside world. Although separated by a barrier, it is a bordering world to its outside, as opposed to being in a parallel universe. There are no seas in Gensokyo, since it is an inland mountain. In Gensokyo, there are few humans, and various kinds of yōkai. Some species include magicians, beasts, therianthropies, vampires, bōrei, tengu, mermaids, kappa, and yōkai (a kind of miscellaneous group). There are others species that could be yōkai depending on definition, like fairies, spirits, yūrei, onryō, poltergeists, hermits, oni, and gods.\n\nIn present Gensokyo, which is presented in all \"Touhou Project\" games since EoSD, as opposed to the outside world where unscientific phenomena were dismissed as \"superstition\" by the time of the Meiji era, magical and spiritual qualities prevail. The only known gateway from the outside world into Gensokyo is the Hakurei Shrine on the border of Gensokyo. The spell card rules were also established to keep up the relationship between humans and yōkai in a mock style, which was necessary for the preservation of the balance of Gensokyo. The \"Great Hakurei Barrier,\" managed by Hakurei Miko, was constructed several decades before EoSD, which is described as a \"barrier of common sense,\" and is thus a strong logical barrier that not even yōkai can pass through. The yōkai were at first against its construction, but then gradually understood its usefulness.\n\nIn Gensokyo, events called \"incidents\" occur once in a while. An incident is an event that affects all of Gensokyo and is of unknown cause at the time it occurs. \"Touhou Project\" mainly focuses on incidents in its stories, but there are also works like \"Mountain of Faith\" that are about events other than incidents.\n\nFrequently, incidents are due to a yōkai's whim or curiosity, and usually Reimu Hakurei would go to investigate it and then find and chastise the perpetrator. Usually, the shrine maiden of the Hakurei Shrine resolves incidents, but there are cases where Marisa Kirisame and other imitators would resolve them. When a major incident occurs, the spirits and fairies are affected by the circumstances, the incident, and the perpetrator, and experience an increase in power for the duration incident, so there are also cases where a mere fairy defeats Reimu. It has additionally been stated that people of the village also go out to resolve incidents.\n\nWith its focus on bishōjo characters, the \"Touhou\" series possesses a large cast compared to other shooting games. While they aren't developed nearly to the standards of a story-based game, many players love them, and even obscure stage bosses who only appear once have a fanbase. One example is Hong Meiling, affectionately known as Chūgoku (China), the stage 3 boss of \"The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil\", who won a popularity contest in Japan out of all \"Touhou\" characters. Among the vast array of characters, only six named characters are male. One (Genjii) is a turtle, one is a cat (Sokrates), two (Youki Konpaku and Myouren Hijiri) are only mentioned in passing, one (Rinnosuke Morichika) is only featured in the serialized novel, and the last (Unzan) is a cloud-like entity. There is also one before all these (Shingyoku), but this character has three forms of different genders, so this character may not exactly be male.\n\nThough each game features a collection of different characters, the main protagonist of the series is always Reimu Hakurei, joined by Marisa Kirisame after the second game. Exceptions to this include \"Shoot the Bullet\" and \"Double Spoiler\" (Aya Shameimaru is playable on both, and Hatate Himekaidou can become playable in \"Double Spoiler\"); \"Fairy Wars\" (which has Cirno as the sole playable character); \"Impossible Spell Card\" (where only Seija Kijin is playable); and \"Violet Detector\" (where only Sumireko Usami is playable).\n\nThe \"Touhou Project\" is a one-man project by a Japanese game maker, Jun'ya Ōta (usually under the pseudonym ZUN), who does all the graphics, music, and programming alone for the bullet hell games, with the exceptions of the portrait art in \"Fairy Wars\", which is by Makoto Hirasaka, and the fighting games, \"Immaterial and Missing Power\", \"Scarlet Weather Rhapsody\", \"Touhou Hisōtensoku\", \"Hopeless Masquerade\", and \"Urban Legend in Limbo\", which were dual efforts with Twilight Frontier.\n\nThe idea of \"Touhou\" first came to ZUN during his high school years, when shrine maiden-themed games were in the minority. \"It would be nice to make shrine maiden games,\" he thought, and often imagined the music that would go with such games. He went to college, hoping to compose music for fighting games, since they were popular at the time due to \"Street Fighter II\". However, he decided that in order to put his music into games, it would be easier to make his own game to go with it, thus the first \"Touhou\" game, \"Highly Responsive to Prayers\", was released in 1996. The first game was originally intended as a practice in programming. \"Touhou\" only became a shooting game series starting from the second game, because the popularity of shooting games had revived due to \"RayForce\" and ZUN had long been a fan of such games. ZUN remarked how the general theme and direction of \"Touhou\" only started coming together in the sixth game, \"Embodiment of Scarlet Devil\".\n\nZUN develops his games with Visual Studio, Adobe Photoshop, and Cubase, according to his interview in \"Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red\".\n\nA prodigious number of derivative works based on \"Touhou\" have been created since the release of \"Embodiment of Scarlet Devil\". These include dōjinshi, dōjin music, dōjin anime, and dōjin games (even though the \"Touhou\" games themselves are dōjin games). The vast scope of \"Touhou\" derivatives prompted commentary, noting that \"Touhou Project\" became an unmissable aspect of Japanese consumer generated media. These dōjin activities are mostly responsible for adding original attributes to characters that ZUN may not have intended. ZUN, for the most part, had acknowledged, appreciated, and even encouraged these derivative works by imposing very few restrictions on the use of his works. The major restrictions are on unauthorized commercial distribution (as opposed to dōjin) and the spoiling of endings; proper attribution to Team Shanghai Alice is a recommendation. ZUN stated himself that he did not want the \"Touhou Project\" game series to be officially commercialized.\nThe first recent publication of \"Touhou\" derivative doujinshi occurred during December 2003, following the release of \"Perfect Cherry Blossom\"; seven circles sold \"Touhou\" derivative works at Comiket 65 in December 2003. At the Comiket 74 in August 2008, a total of 885 circles had \"Touhou\" derivative works on display or for sale, out of a total of 35,000 circles participating at Comiket. At Comiket 77 (December 2009), 2,372 circles were dedicated to \"Touhou\", breaking the previous record held by \"The Prince of Tennis\" at Comiket 66 (August 2004), which had 2,130 circles. At Comiket 85 (December 2013), \"Touhou\" was still in the lead, with 2,272 participating circles selling \"Touhou\" derivatives, far outpacing those of other franchises.\n\nThe dōjin games based on \"Touhou\" include adaptations of other game series' mechanics with \"Touhou\" characters, such as \"Super Marisa Land\" and \"Super Marisa World\" (parodies of the Mario games with the titles being a play on \"Super Mario Land\" and \"Super Mario World\", respectively), \"MegaMari\" (based on the \"Mega Man series\"), and \"Touhou Soccer\" (based on the \"Captain Tsubasa\" games by Tecmo). The music of \"Touhou\" is also very popular and many arrangement CDs can be found for sale at Comiket and other Japanese conventions.\n\nAt Tokyo Game Show 2014, ZUN announced a collaborative project with PlayStation bringing unofficial, fan-made \"Touhou Project\" \"dōjin\" games to the PlayStation 4 (PS4) and PlayStation Vita platforms. As of September 2014, by Aqua Style, by Strawberry Bose and by Area-Zero have been announced for release on the PS4. The games will be published by Mediascape, under contract by Sony Computer Entertainment and ZUN, as part of a move towards embracing indie games for commercial distribution on PlayStation platforms.\n\nAmong the most popular derivatives are the series of Flash videos created by the dōjin music circle IOSYS. Many of them, one of which is \"Marisa Stole the Precious Thing,\" are popular on otaku internet forums and Nico Nico Douga.\n\nA major internet meme based on \"Touhou\" is , which centers around the disembodied, deformed heads of \"Touhou\" characters, often referred to as \"yukkuris\". This meme originated from a disfigured attempt to draw the main characters Reimu and Marisa with Shift JIS art. Yukkuris became so popular that the phrase \"Yukkuri shite itte ne!!!\" won bronze for 2008's \"Net Slang of the Year\" in Japan. Yukkuris also appear in Internet advertisements, the anime \"Natsu no Arashi!\" and \"Pani Poni Dash!\", and most notably, the front page of 2channel, the largest Internet forum in the world. Yuyuko Saigyouji and Reimu Hakurei also make cameo character appearances in Square Enix's game \"Lord of Vermilion Re:2\".\n\nA short derivative animated project, was produced by Ufotable in celebration of the 10th anniversary of Japanese goods chain Animate as a promotional video for the store combining the world of \"Touhou\" with Animate's mascot, Meito Anizawa. Several fanmade anime have also been made for \"Touhou\". A dōjin anime project by the dōjin circle Maikaze, titled , is a fan-made anime adaptation with an original plot featuring \"Touhou\" characters, with four episodes released from 2008 to 2016, and the 2.5th episode released in 2014; the last episode will be released in 2020. Albeit created by an amateur studio, the project featured professional voice actors. Another dōjin anime by the circle Manpuku Jinja, titled (without voice dubbing but have background music and sound), was released at Comiket 80 in 2011, with one episode released based on the storyline of \"Perfect Cherry Blossom\", and there are nine episodes as of 2017.\n\nKyoto Fantasy Troupe, a Chinese dōjin circle, made a dōjin anime titled \"Hifuu Club Activity Record ~ The Sealed Esoteric History\" (). The first episode was released at Comiket 89 in late 2015 and Chengdu TouhouOnly05 in early 2016, and it also featured professional Japanese voice actors when it was released again later. The second episode was released in 2017. Another Chinese dōjin circle, Perpetual Motion Niche, is also making a dōjin anime titled \"Secluded Magic Instrument~ Meteors of Triple Dimension\" (), which is about the story of the collision of three worlds——the forgotten Eastern Country (in the PC-98 games), Gensokyo (in the Windows games) and the outside world; the first episode was released in Q3 2017.\n\nThe \"Touhou Project\" was nominated for the 11th annual Media Arts Awards held by Japan's Agency for Cultural Affairs, under the Entertainment category, where \"Touhou Project\" eventually lost to Nintendo's \"Wii Sports\" for the Grand Prize award.\n\nThe is the largest of the many dōjin conventions hosting only \"Touhou\" content. Although the coordinator of this convention has nothing to do with Team Shanghai Alice officially, the name \"Hakurei Shrine Reitaisai\" was given by ZUN himself. It first started in the year 2004 as a way for Team Shanghai Alice to publicly distribute the trial version for their upcoming games to the fans well in advance of releasing them on the internet; in addition, the 2004 Reitaisai featured a total of 114 participating circles. Since then, many \"Touhou\" derivative works are also gathered and sold there. Commencing every year in April or May, the convention has been hosted in Ōta, Tokyo in 2004; Naka-ku, Yokohama in 2005; Sunshine City, Tokyo in 2006 and 2007; and the Tokyo Big Sight in 2008 and after. The year 2010 saw the birth of Reitaisai SP, an additional Reitaisai to be held every autumn due to increasing popularity, but Reitaisai SP was canceled after 2011. The 2011 Reitaisai was originally canceled due to safety concerns after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. It was later rescheduled and held on May 8, 2011 with approximately 4,940 participating circles. In addition to events in Japan, there is another Reitaisai held in Taiwan starting in 2015.\n\n"}

The house is located in San Isidro, in the province of Buenos Aires, approximately 30 km north of the city of Buenos Aires.\n\nOriginally the summer house of the Ocampo family, it became Victoria Ocampo's permanent residence in 1940. The house is famous for its list of distinguished visitors who came to Argentina invited by Victoria: Rabindranath Tagore, Igor Stravinsky, Le Corbusier, Albert Camus, Graham Greene, Federico García Lorca, André Malraux, José Ortega y Gasset, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, Saint-John Perse (Alexis Léger), among many others. Villa Ocampo was also a regular meeting place for Argentine writers, among them Jorge Luis Borges and Adolfo Bioy Casares, who met there for the first time in 1931. It was the inspiration for the Blue Villa in Alain Robbe-Grillet's 1965 novel \"La Maison de rendez-vous\".\n\nThe Villa was built in 1891 by Manuel Ocampo, Victoria’s father. Its architecture is eclectic, combining influences of British and French origin.

Witblits is predominately produced in the Western Cape where it has enjoyed over 200 years. Many producers take great pride in their product, often brewing small batches to sell at informal markets so as to maintain or improve their recipes. Another name used to describe this alcoholic beverage is \"firewater\", a name earned without a doubt from the strong punch it delivers.\n\nIn 1924 KWV was granted legal control over the production of wine, spirits and brandy. Accordingly, the distillation of Witblits was criminalized for many years. Although KWV maintained a monopoly on certain lines of liquor, it is evident that many traditions and familial practices could be maintained. Once the ban was lifted distilling for personal use is now legal, provided an appropriate license is obtained.\n\nWitblits is a brandy made from grapes, usually by using leftovers from the winery. Witblits is un-aged, meaning no maturation takes place which results in the liquid staying quite clear. Another one of Witblits' traits is that it is undiluted; this gives it its characteristically high proof. These factors, as with Mampoer, allow us to classify Witblits as Moonshine. The association to Moonshine should not necessarily be linked to quality. Many farmers take pride in making witblits using refined handed down recipes resulting in a brandy of higher quality than typical moonshine.\n\nDrinking - The dominant reason for production. Witblits consumption is associated with social activities as well as those of relaxation.\n\nCleaning Agent - Thanks to Witblits' high alcohol content it is really good at cutting through stains and clean them up. Add to this that the alcohol has a strong smell and evaporates quickly, it can be used to assist with deodorizing too.\n\nMedical Applications - Witblits is a strong disinfectant, again due to the high alcohol content. Alcohol denatures proteins very well and by extension germs too. Soaking items in Witblits or rubbing it onto an area\nwhere skin is going to be pierced (Example. injections and piercings) will\nreduce the risk of infection.\n\nHerbal Remedies - The high alcoholic content has found use by many as a solvent in tinctures, increasing the shelf-life and effectiveness of the flowers and herbs in use.\n\nVarious farms producing Witblits in the Western Cape have scheduled witblits tastings and witblits tours to promote the liquor and raise the profile of their brands. In Philippolis, located in the Free State Province, an annual Witblits Festival is held every April, where visitors to the festival and taste and purchase their Witblits liquors.\nIf you do find yourself attending the Wiblits Festival, be prepared to witness or partake in the ’bokdrol spoeg’ a competition which involves spitting Witblits-soaked kudu droppings.\n\nWitblits distillation for the purpose of large volume resale is illegal in South Africa. In 1924 the government passed legislation which gave KWV a monopoly on brandy production. All stills had to be marked and registered with Customs and Excise, and detailed records kept as to the amount and strength of any liquor produced. Farmers were allowed to produce liquor only from fruit grown on their land. In the United States of America (USA) Moonshine is illegal mainly due to the revenue that it produces compared to beer or wine. The tax excise on spirits is approximately $2.14 per bottle compared to $0.14 per bottle of wine and $0.05 per can of beer. There is also a concern for the health of consumers thereof and the safety risk behind homemade brewing due to the apparatus involved. In some States a person can still purchase a legal version of witblits or moonshine from commercial distillers. Total volume produced cannot exceed a fixed amount per year as detailed in local South African laws.\n\nIntoxication, flushed skin, impairment of balance, loss of muscle control, feeling of euphoria, decreased social inhibition, impaired decision making, blindness, neurological damage, paralysis\n\n\n"}
