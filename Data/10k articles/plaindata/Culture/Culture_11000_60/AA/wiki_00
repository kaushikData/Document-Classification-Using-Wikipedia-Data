In 1966 it was stolen from Kom's royal compound. Seven years later it was recognized in a U.S. art gallery, and after some dispute, it was returned to the Kom people.\n\nThe Afo-A-Kom, which means \"the Kom thing\" (also \"Mbang\" in the Kom language) is a 62.5 inch wooden stylized carving of a standing man, crowned and holding a scepter, behind a stool supported on three carved buffalo heads. The core is iroko wood. His face is sheathed in copper and much of the body is covered with reddish and blue beads. (See the Arthemis link below for a photo online.) The Foyn/Fon (chief) cares for the statue, and it symbolizes \"royal authority and the promise of continued succession.\" The carver of this statue is unknown but it is speculated that Afo-A-Kom was carved by the second traditional leader (Foyn) of the Kom people in the 1920s.\n\nIn 1966, the Afo-A-Kom was stolen from its sacred grove at Laikom (the seat of the Kom people, where the Foyn resides) by one of the princes, then sold to a middle man who later sold it to an art dealer who took it to the United States of America. The Kom people believe that the Afo-A-Kom possesses mystical powers and that shortly after it arrived in the US it began disturbing its new owners by destroying everything around it. Its new owner took it and threw it into the sea but only to get back home and see the Afo-A-Kom. He took it to a New York art gallery where he sold it for circa 15 million CFA. While there it was recognized, and American art collector Warren M. Robbins raised an alarm. He raised funds together with other Americans and some Kom elite in the US to purchase the stolen statue back from the Manhattan art gallery for under $30,000. Returning the figure, Robbins was welcomed by the Fon of the Kom people Nsom Ngwe, and the President of Cameroon Ahmadou Ahidjo, among other dignitaries.\n\nDuring the reception of the statue in Yaounde, Ahidjo suggested to Fon Nsom Ngwe that Mbang be kept in the National Museum in Yaounde, but the Fon replied that if the President can provide enough space in Yaounde for him to go and bring the Kom people to stay with it there, then he would accept the president's proposal. Seeing that Kom and the Afo-A-Kom were inseparable, the president made it possible for the statue to be taken back to its habitual residence at Laikom. However, it was briefly put on display at the Tourism Office in Yaounde and later on transported by air to Bamenda. It was then ferried by a delegation of the dignitaries of the region back to Fundong where it was handed back to the Kom people.\n\nIt is now in the Laikom palace where it is put on display annually for the Kom people.\n\n"}

When he was 13 his father died and he was sent to an orphanage. There he was forced to become a tailor although he wanted to become a watchmaker.\nHe became a master craftsman at 21, but he still was interested in mechanics. In his spare time in 1808 he invented the first artificial limb with a joint.\n\nOne of Berblinger's inventions was what appears to be a hang glider. He worked on it for years, improving it and watching the flight of owls. People made fun of him and he was threatened with exclusion from the guild. He was ordered to pay a large fine for his working outside of the guild. Nevertheless, he invested his whole income in his project. King Frederick I of Württemberg became interested in his work and sponsored him with 20 Louis.\n\nHe tried to demonstrate the glider on the evening of 30 May 1811 in the presence of the king, his three sons and the crown prince of Bavaria. The king and a large number of citizens waited for the flight but Berblinger cancelled it, claiming that his glider was damaged. The next day he made a second attempt from a higher location – the Adlerbastei (\"Eagles Bastion\"). The King had left by this time, but his brother Duke Heinrich and the princes stayed to watch. Berblinger waited so long for a good wind that a policeman finally gave him a push and Berblinger fell into the Donau (\"Danube\"). Other versions of this account have no mention of the policeman and claim that the difference in temperature over the cold Donau (Danube) limited thermal updrafts and therefore the glider failed to lift. \nHe survived and was rescued by fishermen, but his reputation was ruined as a result and his work suffered. He was 58 years old when he died in a hospital.\n\nThe story of the tailor, who tried to fly, subsequently resulted in some fleer and allusions in publications of the 19th century. When Wilhelm Busch drew a man falling into a stream in his picture story \"Max and Moritz\", he could count on some awareness of his readers. It was not until the end of the century that Otto Lilienthal proved the feasibility of heavier-than-air flight.\n\n\n\n\n"}

This interaction between the natural landscape and humans creates the cultural landscape. This understanding is a foundation of cultural geography but has been augmented over the past forty years with more nuanced and complex concepts of culture, drawn from a wide range of disciplines including anthropology, sociology, literary theory, and feminism. No single definition of culture dominates within cultural geography. Regardless of their particular interpretation of culture, however, geographers wholeheartedly reject theories that treat culture as if it took place \"on the head of a pin\".\n\nAmong many applicable topics within the field of study are:\nThis geography studies the geography of culture\n\nThough the first traces of the study of different nations and cultures on Earth can be dated back to ancient geographers such as Ptolemy or Strabo, cultural geography as academic study firstly emerged as an alternative to the environmental determinist theories of the early Twentieth century, which had believed that people and societies are controlled by the environment in which they develop. Rather than studying pre-determined regions based upon environmental classifications, cultural geography became interested in cultural landscapes. This was led by Carl O. Sauer (called the father of cultural geography), at the University of California, Berkeley. As a result, cultural geography was long dominated by American writers.\n\nSauer defined the landscape as the defining unit of geographic study. He saw that cultures and societies both developed out of their landscape, but also shaped them too. This interaction between the natural landscape and humans creates the cultural landscape. Sauer's work was highly qualitative and descriptive and was challenged in the 1930s by the regional geography of Richard Hartshorne. Hartshorne called for systematic analysis of the elements that varied from place to place, a project taken up by the quantitative revolution. Cultural geography was sidelined by the positivist tendencies of this effort to make geography into a hard science although writers such as David Lowenthal continued to write about the more subjective, qualitative aspects of landscape.\n\nIn the 1970s, new kind of critique of positivism in geography directly challenged the deterministic and abstract ideas of quantitative geography. This revitalized cultural geography manifested itself in the engagement of geographers such as Yi-Fu Tuan and Edward Relph and Anne Buttimer with humanism, phenomenology, and hermeneutics. This break initiated a strong trend in human geography toward Post-positivism that developed under the label New Cultural Geography while deriving methods of systematic social and cultural critique from critical geography.\n\nSince the 1980s, a \"new cultural geography\" has emerged, drawing on a diverse set of theoretical traditions, including Marxist political-economic models, feminist theory, post-colonial theory, post-structuralism and psychoanalysis.\n\nDrawing particularly from the theories of Michel Foucault and performativity in western academia, and the more diverse influences of postcolonial theory, there has been a concerted effort to deconstruct the cultural in order to reveal that power relations are fundamental to spatial processes and sense of place. Particular areas of interest are how identity politics are organized in space and the construction of subjectivity in particular places.\n\nExamples of areas of study include:\n\nSome within the \"new cultural geography\" have turned their attention to critiquing some of its ideas, seeing its views on identity and space as static. It has followed the critiques of Foucault made by other 'poststructuralist' theorists such as Michel de Certeau and Gilles Deleuze. In this area, non-representational geography and population mobility research have dominated. Others have attempted to incorporate these and other critiques back into the new cultural geography.\n\nGroups within the geography community have differing views on the role of culture and how to analyze it in the context of geography. It is commonly thought that physical geography simply dictates aspects of culture such as shelter, clothing and cuisine. However, systematic development of this idea is generally discredited as environmental determinism. Geographers are now more likely to understand culture as a set of symbolic resources that help people make sense of the world around them, as well as a manifestation of the power relations between various groups and the structure through which social change is constrained and enabled. There are many ways to look at what culture means in light of various geographical insights, but in general geographers study how cultural processes involve spatial patterns and processes while requiring the existence and maintenance of particular kinds of places.\n\nAcademic peer reviewed journals which are primarily focused on cultural geography or which contain articles that contribute to the area. \n\n\n\n"}

The adult beetle is long, while the xylophagous larvae are up to long.\n\nTo attract mates, these woodborers create a tapping or ticking sound that can be heard in the rafters of old buildings on quiet summer nights. They are therefore associated with quiet, sleepless nights and are named for the vigil (watch) kept beside the dying or dead, and by extension the superstitious have seen the deathwatch beetle as an omen of impending death.\n\nThe term \"death watch\" has been applied to a variety of other ticking insects, including \"Anobium striatum\", some of the so-called booklice of the family Psocidae, and the appropriately named \"Atropos divinatoria\" and \"Clothilla pulsatoria\" (Greek goddesses Atropos and Clotho were associated with death).\n\nThe larva is very soft, yet can bore its way through wood, which it is able to digest using a number of enzymes in its alimentary canal, provided that the wood has experienced prior fungal decay.\n\nIts nature as an ill omen is alluded to in the fourth book of John Keats' 1818 poem \"Endymion\": \"...within ye hear / No sound so loud as when on curtain'd bier / The death-watch tick is stifled.\" (\"Stifled\" because the death it was portending has taken place.)\n\nIn 1838 Henry David Thoreau published an essay mentioning the deathwatch beetle. It is possible that this essay influenced Edgar Allan Poe's 1843 short story \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" and that the sound the protagonist was hearing at the end of that story was that of a beetle tapping inside the wall, not the beating of the (dead) victim's heart.\n\nThe beetle was referenced in Mark Twain's 1876 \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\": \"Next the ghastly ticking of a deathwatch in the wall at the bed's head made Tom shudder – it meant that somebody's days were numbered.\"\n\nIn 1988, Linda Pastan wrote a poem entitled \"The Deathwatch Beetle\".\n\nIn 1995 Alice Hoffman referenced the deathwatch beetle in her novel \"Practical Magic\" as an omen of death whenever anyone hears its clicking until that person dies.\n\n"}
{"id": "6487468", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6487468", "title": "Edublog", "text": "Edublog\n\nAn edublog is a blog created for educational purposes. Edublogs archive and support student and teacher learning by facilitating reflection, questioning by self and others, collaboration and by providing contexts for engaging in higher-order thinking. Edublogs proliferated when blogging architecture became more simplified and teachers perceived the instructional potential of blogs as an online resource. The use of blogs has become popular in education institutions including public schools and colleges. Blogs can be useful tools for sharing information and tips among co-workers, providing information for students, or keeping in contact with parents. Common examples include blogs written by or for teachers, blogs maintained for the purpose of classroom instruction, or blogs written about educational policy. Educators who blog are sometimes called edubloggers.\n\nWeblogs have existed for close to two decades. However, it wasn't until the second half of the 1990s that weblogs began to grow in popularity. In 1998, there were just a handful of sites of the type that are now identified as weblogs (so named by Jorn Barger in December 1997). In 1999, there were 23 known weblogs, and Pitas http://www.pitas.com/, the first free build your own weblog tool, was launched. Also in 1999 weblogs changed from a mix of links, commentary, and thoughts, to short form journal entries. An early recorded use of the term \"edublog\" can be traced to a webring called the Edublog WebRing, founded on January 30, 2002. The new use of weblogs are largely interest driven and attract readers who have similar interests. In 2004, there were an estimated 3 million blogs and as of July 2011, there are an estimated 164 million blogs.\n\nThe Edublog Awards, the international and community based awards programme for the use of blogs and social media to support education, runs annually online across a range of platforms. The Awards were founded by James N. Farmer in 2004.\n\nThere are several uses of edublogs. Some bloggers use their blogs as a learning journal or a knowledge log to gather relevant information and ideas, and communicate with other people. Some teachers use blogs to keep in contact with students' parents. Some bloggers use blogs to record their own personal life, \nand express emotions or feelings. Some instructors use blogs as an instructional and assessment tool, and blogs can be used as a task management tool. Blogs are used to teach individuals about writing for an audience as they can be made public, and blogging software makes it easier to create content for the Web without knowing much HTML.\n\nEducational blogs have also been used as an engagement and reflective assessment tool for Accounting students and can improve educational outcomes for Accounting students.\n\nThere are many teacher-related blogs on the internet where teachers can share information with one another. Teachers familiarize themselves with edublogs before implementing them with their students. Many teachers share materials and ideas to meet the diverse needs of all learners in their classrooms. Teachers can often rely on these sources to communicate with one another regarding any issues in education that they may be having, including classroom management techniques and policies. In this way, the blog often acts as a support system for teachers where they can access ideas, tools, and gain support and recognition from other professionals in their field. Weblogs can provide a forum for reading, writing and collaborating.\n\nEdublogs can be used as instructional resources, in which teachers can post tips, explanations or samples to help students learn. The use of blogs in the classroom allows both the teacher and student the ability to edit and add content at any time. The ability for both the teacher and student to edit content allows for study to take place outside the classroom environment, since blogs can usually be accessed using the URL of the blog on any computer. Blogs increase exposure to other students from around the country or world, while improving writing and communication skills. Teachers are using blogs as a way to post important information such as homework, important dates, missed lessons, projects, discussion boards, and other useful classroom information that is accessible by all. As noted, students can access this information from home, or from any computer that is connected to the Internet.\n\nTeachers and parents can also use blogs in order to communicate with one another. They can be used to post class announcements for parents or providing schedule reminders. Connecting to a teacher's blog is also a convenient way for parents to find out daily assignments so that they can monitor their children's progress and understand classroom expectations.\n\nStudent blogging describes students in Kindergarten to Grade 12 who are using blogs in some way in a formal classroom context. Blogs are digital platforms that provide students with a medium for sharing knowledge and experiences that go beyond the traditional means of reading and writing in classrooms. Student blogging is a relative newcomer to the digital writing scene, and appears to have gained ground only in the past 7–8 years. In the past 5 years, however, student blogging has become a relatively common phenomenon in classrooms around the world. This may be attributable to the increase in free blog hosting services that have adjustable privacy settings, and the opening up of school internet filters to a greater range of social media.\n\nThe use of blogs in education gives students a global perspective. Teachers and students from different states, countries, and continents are able to collaborate on different projects and ideas. A classroom in China can collaborate with classrooms in Germany, Mexico, Australia, etc. with just a few clicks of a button. Learning through blogs allows students to take control of their own learning and steer it to their own needs. Students are able to see that opinions and even strategies vary based on location and culture. Children are all different, but a common thread of learning can unite them. The use of blogs in the classroom engages children in learning and using technological literacy that will help them in adulthood.\n\nThere has not been a significant amount of research conducted on K-12 students regarding the efficacy of edublogs in enhancing learning. However, anecdotal results discussed by educators have given a glimpse into their utility or promise. There is a general consensus that edublogs create many opportunities for collaborative learning, as well as enhance the ability to locate and reflect upon work.\n\nAccording to extant literature, students use blogging in classrooms for different purposes. Blogs are used to showcase individual student work by enabling them to publish texts, video clips, audio clips, maps, photos and other images, projects and suchlike in a potentially publicly accessible forum. Proponents of student blogging argue that blogging can contribute directly to improved writing abilities and argue that classroom blogging can enable students to engage with audiences beyond their classroom walls by using blogs as personal journals, as diaries, for story writing, and for making editorial responses to news events. \nResearchers have also documented teachers using student blogging to promote creativity and self-expression.\n\nSome researchers claim that student blogs promote learning by providing opportunities for students to take more control of their learning and the content they engage. It is also claimed that student blogging intrinsically motivates students to become better readers and writers.\n\nThere is very little research on student blogging available. That being said, there is a large amount of published anecdotal evidence regarding criticisms of student blogging or limitations in using blogging in classrooms. For example, commentators claim that student blogs often include uncorrected inaccuracies of information, or can be used to instigate online bullying. Commentators also complain that student blogs are difficult to archive or index.\n\n\nAlthough there are many blogs that teachers can use in the classroom with their students, there is also a multitude of blogs that teachers can use for their own professional development. Such blogs include hints on ways to be a better teacher in a certain subject area such as music, mathematics, or ESL, blogs on educational theory, blogs on advice for new teachers, blogs on where to find free technology, and blogs on transforming education, for example. There is much that can be learned from blogs of other teaching professionals and the learning can be done anytime and anywhere.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "970563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=970563", "title": "Edward T. Hall", "text": "Edward T. Hall\n\nEdward Twitchell Hall, Jr. (May 16, 1914 – July 20, 2009) was an American anthropologist and cross-cultural researcher. He is remembered for developing the concept of proxemics and exploring cultural and social cohesion, and describing how people behave and react in different types of culturally defined personal space. Hall was an influential colleague of Marshall McLuhan and Buckminster Fuller.\n\nHall was born in Webster Groves, Missouri and taught at the University of Denver, Colorado, Bennington College in Vermont, Harvard Business School, Illinois Institute of Technology, Northwestern University in Illinois and others. The foundation for his lifelong research on cultural perceptions of space was laid during World War II, when he served in the U.S. Army in Europe and the Philippines.\n\nFrom 1933 through 1937, Hall lived and worked with the Navajo and the Hopi on Native American reservations in northeastern Arizona, the subject of his autobiographical \"West of the Thirties.\" He received his Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1942 and continued with field work and direct experience throughout Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. During the 1950s he worked for the United States State Department, at the Foreign Service Institute (FSI), teaching inter-cultural communications skills to foreign service personnel, developed the concept of \"high context culture\" and \"low context culture\", and wrote several popular practical books on dealing with cross-cultural issues. He is considered a founding father of intercultural communication as an academic area of study.\n\nThroughout his career, Hall introduced a number of new concepts, including proxemics, monochronictime, polychronic time, and high-context and low-context cultures. In his second book, \"The Hidden Dimension\", he describes the culturally specific temporal and spatial dimensions that surround each of us, such as the physical distances people maintain in different contexts.\n\nIn \"The Silent Language\" (1959), Hall coined the term \"polychronic\" to describe the ability to attend to multiple events simultaneously, as opposed to \"monochronic\" individuals and cultures who tend to handle events sequentially.\n\nIn 1976, he released his third book, \"Beyond Culture\", which is notable for having developed the idea of extension transference; by an extension, he simply means any technological item, from clothes to laptops. He brings to our attention the fact that these 'extensions' only help us perform certain functions, but they as extensions will never quite be able to carry out these functions by themselves (for example, think about computers, airplanes, etc. We can fly with airplanes, but we can't on our own and nor can airplanes fly 'on their own'). His biggest claim is that culture itself is an extension of man. Extensions also exist in their own evolutionary realm, as well. That is, they evolve on their own and do not directly influence human evolution. \n\nThe 'transference' of 'extension transference' is a term he coined to describe when people regard a symbol to actually be its referent. The clearest example of this would be language; like when people do not realize that words are merely symbolic to their referents. For example, there is nothing inherently watery about the physical object \"water\", at least in terms of the symbolic acoustic properties that are produced when someone utters \"water\". Evidence for this would be the fact that across languages there are thousands of unique words that all refer to water. Culture, as an extension, is also a good example; extension transference of culture happens naturally when people are unaware of the extent to which culture shapes how they perceive time and space, or that culture shapes their perception of them at all. Time and space are the two prominent aspects that Hall in particular focuses on in many of his works. \n\nHe died at his home in Santa Fe, New Mexico on July 20, 2009.\n\nAccording to Nina Brown, the work of Hall was so groundbreaking that it created a multitude of other areas for research. One of the most widely sought after topics of anthropology is an idea that was first introduced by Edward Hall: Anthropology of Space. Brown goes on to mention that the Anthropology of Space has essentially opened the door to dozens of new topics. Along with influencing the Anthropology of Space, Hall's research had a substantial influence on the development of intercultural communication as a research topic. Since at least 1990, he has been acknowledged frequently for his role in introducing nonverbal aspects of communication, specifically proxemics, the study of the social uses of space, the investigation of communication between members of different cultures. For example, Robert Shuter, a well-known intercultural communication researcher, commented: \"Edward Hall's research reflects the regimen and passion of an anthropologist: a deep regard for culture explored principally by descriptive, qualitative methods... The challenge for intercultural communication... is to develop a research direction and teaching agenda that returns culture to preeminence and reflects the roots of the field as represented in Edward Hall's early research.\"\n\nWhat was particularly innovative about Hall's early work is that instead of focusing on a single culture at a time, or cross-cultural comparison, as was typical in 1950's anthropology, he responded to the needs of his students at the Foreign Service Institute of the Department of State to help them understand interactions between members of different cultures. Hall points out that the only environment in which classroom dialogue is encountered is simply in the classroom, ergo it served the students little use when actually in the foreign country of interest. At the same time, and in response to the same students, he narrowed his focus from an entire culture, as was then standard within anthropology, to smaller moments of interaction. Colleagues working with him at FSI at the time included Henry Lee Smith, George L. Trager, Charles F. Hockett, and Ray Birdwhistell. Between them, they used descriptive linguistics as a model for not only proxemics but also kinesics and paralanguage.\n\n\n\n"}

The writer J. R. R. Tolkien coined the word by affixing the Greek prefix \"eu\", meaning \"good\", to \"catastrophe\", the word traditionally used in classically inspired literary criticism to refer to the \"unraveling\" or conclusion of a drama's plot. For Tolkien, the term appears to have had a thematic meaning that went beyond its literal etymological meaning in terms of form. In his definition as outlined in his 1947 essay \"On Fairy-Stories\", eucatastrophe is a fundamental part of his conception of mythopoeia. Though Tolkien's interest is in myth, it is also connected to the gospel; Tolkien calls the Incarnation of Christ the eucatastrophe of \"human history\" and the Resurrection the eucatastrophe of the Incarnation.\n\nEucatastrophe has been labelled as a form of deus ex machina, due to both sharing an impossible problem being suddenly resolved. However, differences between the two have also been noted, such as its inherent connection to an optimistic view on the unfolding of events in the narrative of the world. In his view, eucatastrophe can also occur without the use of a deus ex machina.\n\nEucatastrophe has been observed in the climax of \"The Lord of the Rings\". Though victory seems assured for Sauron, the One Ring is permanently destroyed as a result of Gollum's waylaying of Frodo at Mount Doom.\n\nAnother example of eucatastrophe is the recurring role of the eagles as unexpected rescuers throughout Tolkien's writing. Tolkien described Bilbo's \"'eucatastrophic emotion\" at the eagles' appearance in \"The Hobbit\" as one of the key moments of the book.\n\n\n"}

Their purpose was to regulate and register the coats of arms of nobility and gentry and boroughs, and to record pedigrees. They took place from 1530 to 1688, and their records (akin to an upper class census) provide important source material for historians and genealogists.\n\nBy the fifteenth century, the use and abuse of coats of arms was becoming widespread in England. One of the duties conferred on William Bruges (or Brydges), the first Garter Principal King of Arms was to survey and record the armorial bearings and pedigrees of those using coats of arms and correct irregularities. Officers of arms had made occasional tours of various parts of the kingdom to enquire about armorial matters during the fifteenth century, however, it was not until the sixteenth century that the process began in earnest.\n\nThe first provincial visitations were carried out under warrant granted by Henry VIII to Thomas Benolt, Clarenceux King of Arms dated 6 April 1530. He was commissioned to travel throughout his province (i.e. south of the Trent) with authority to enter all homes and churches. Upon entering these premises, he was authorized to \"put down or otherwise deface at his discretion... those arms unlawfully used\". He was also required to enquire into all those using the titles of knight, esquire, or gentleman and decided if they were being lawfully used.\n\nBy this writ, Henry VIII also compelled the sheriffs and mayors of each county or city visited by the officers of arms to give aid and assistance in gathering the needed information. When a King of Arms, or Herald, visited a county, his presence was proclaimed by presenting the King's royal commission to the local gentry and nobility, which required them to provide evidence of their right to use a coat of arms. The Sheriff would collect from the bailiff of each hundred within his county a list of all people using titles or arms. \n\nIn the early days, the visiting herald would tour the homes of the gentry and nobility, but from the late 1560s these persons were summoned to attend a central \"place of sitting\" – usually an inn – at a particular time. They were to bring their arms, and proof of their right to use them, most often by way of detailing their ancestral right to them, which would also be recorded. Where an official grant of arms had been made, this was also recorded. Other ancient arms, many of which predated the establishment of the College of Arms, were confirmed. The officer would record the information clearly and make detailed notes that could be entered into the records of the College of Arms when the party returned to London. \n\nThese volumes now make up the collection of Visitation Books at the College, which contain a wealth of information about all armigerous people from the period. If the officers of arms were not presented with sufficient proof of the right to use a coat of arms, they were also empowered to deface monuments which bore these arms and to force persons bearing such arms to sign a disclaimer that they would cease using them. The visitations were not always popular with members of the landed gentry, who were required to present proof of their gentility.\n\nFollowing the accession of William III in 1689, no further commissions to carry out visitations were commanded. The reasons behind this cessation of the programme have been a matter of debate among historians. Philip Styles, for example, related it to a declining willingness of members of the gentry to attend visitations, which he traced to a growing proportion of \"newly risen\" families, who lacked long pedigrees and were therefore apathetic about registering them. However, Janet Verasano has challenged this interpretation, finding that (in Staffordshire, at least) gentry enthusiasm for coats of arms as an enhancement to social standing persisted to the end of the 17th century. The end of the visitations did not have much effect on those counties far removed from London, some of which had only been rarely visited over the entire period of the visitations.\n\nThere was never a systematic visitation of Wales. There were four visitations in the principality, and on 9 June 1551, Fulk ap Hywel, Lancaster Herald of Arms in Ordinary was given a commission to visit all of Wales. This was not carried out, however, as he was degraded and executed for counterfeiting the seal of Clarenceux King of Arms. This is regrettable, since no visitation of all Wales was ever made by the officers of arms.\n\nThe principal records to emerge from the visitations were pedigrees, initially recorded on loose sheets of paper, and afterwards bound together as notebooks. In some cases, the sheets would include blank shields which had been drawn in advance (or at a later date printed), to simplify the process of recording coats of arms. The persons whose pedigrees were recorded were required (from about 1570 onwards) to certify them by signature, and where these original draft pedigrees have survived they are known as \"originals with signatures\". The signed copies were taken back to the College of Arms, where fair copies were made to a higher standard and preserved as the \"office copies\". Sometimes the signed copies were also retained at the College, but in other cases, no longer considered of official interest, they might pass into private hands: once in general circulation, further copies were often made, which might in turn be revised or augmented. As a result, a number of variant manuscript copies of any one visitation record may now survive, possessing varying degrees of accuracy and authority. The Harleian Collection of the British Library is particularly rich in such records. Many visitation records have been published over the years, by the Harleian Society, by county record societies, and a few privately (see listing below). However, because until relatively recently the College of Arms restricted access to its records, many of the older published editions were necessarily based on the unofficial second- or third-generation copies in other collections, and may therefore not always be reliable.\n\nFrom as early as the 1530s, officers of arms on visitation frequently also compiled what were known as \"church notes\". These were fieldnotes (usually in the form of sketches) of coats of arms observed on church monuments, in stained glass windows, or on display in private houses. Sometimes, drawings were also made of non-heraldic antiquities, such as medieval architectural features, views of towns, Roman inscriptions and even Stonehenge.\n\nThe 17th-century visitations generated a growing number of supplementary papers, including warrants, lists of persons who disclaimed any pretence to arms, lists of persons summoned to appear before the heralds (including those who had not appeared), records of fees paid, and miscellaneous correspondence.\n\nVisitations were conducted by or in the name of the two provincial Kings of Arms, Clarenceux and Norroy, within their respective provinces. In the following lists, the Deputies are the officers of arms who actually carried out the visitations. Where no Deputy is named, the visitation can be assumed to have been conducted by the King of Arms in person.\n\nThe Southern Province, the jurisdiction of Clarenceux King of Arms, comprised that part of England south of the River Trent, i.e. the counties of Bedford, Berks, Buckingham, Cambridge, Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Essex, Gloucester, Hereford, Hertford, Huntingdon, Kent, Leicester, Lincoln, Middlesex, Monmouth, Norfolk, Northampton, Oxford, Rutland, Salop, Somerset, Southampton, Suffolk, Surrey, Sussex, Warwick, Wilton, Worcester, and the City of London; and South Wales.\n\nThe Northern Province, the jurisdiction of Norroy King of Arms, comprised that part of England north of the River Trent, i.e. the counties of Chester, Cumberland, Derby, Durham, Lancaster, Northumberland, Nottingham, Stafford, Westmorland and York; and North Wales. The Trent ran through Staffordshire, and the county was therefore technically divided between the two provinces; but for the purposes of visitation it was generally treated (sometimes through a process of deputation) as falling under the jurisdiction of Norroy.\n\nSince the practices of Ulster King of Arms so closely followed those of the English College of Arms, it is hardly surprising that the Irish officers of arms undertook heraldic visitations in their province. The purpose behind these visitations was twofold: to prevent the assumption of arms by unqualified people, and to record the arms of the gentry that were unknown to Ulster office. The first visitation was held by Nicholas Narbon, the second Ulster King of Arms, in 1569. He was authorized to reform practices which were contrary to good armorial practice. He conducted six visitations (Dublin in 1568–1573, Drogheda and Ardee in 1570, Dublin in 1572, Swords in 1572, Cork in 1574, and Limerick in 1574). One of his successors, Daniel Molyneux had the commission renewed, and mounted several visitations. Although Molyneux's last visitation – of Wexford – was the last proper visitation, two other expeditions occurred after 1618 by subsequent Ulster Kings of Arms. The visitations were not very extensive. The officers would not often be found in the disturbed countryside. Thus the visitations are confined to areas under firm control of the Dublin administration.\n\nToday, the original visitation and related manuscripts are in the custody of the Chief Herald of Ireland. Copies are also deposited at the College of Arms in London.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(see also: Cornish heraldry)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

An institutional repository might also include other digital assets generated by academics, such as datasets, administrative documents, course notes, learning objects, or conference proceedings. Deposit of material in an institutional repository is sometimes mandated by that institution.\n\nSome of the main objectives for having an institutional repository are to provide open access to institutional research output by self-archiving in an open access repository, to create global visibility for an institution's scholarly research, and to store and preserve other institutional digital assets, including unpublished or otherwise easily lost (\"grey\") literature such as theses, working papers or technical reports.\n\nDigital institutional repositories are document servers enabling researchers to archive their research output. Worldwide institutions are starting to implement digital institutional repositories for digital formats of research. Scholarly output can be born-digital, in which no digitalisation is necessary before the research is included in a digital repository. A digital institutional repository accessible through the Internet can improve the visibility, usage and impact of research conducted at an institution.\n\nThe origin of the notion of an institutional repository are twofold:\n\nIn 2003 the function of an institutional repository was coined by Clifford Lynch in relation to universities. He argued that:\n\n\"... a university-based institutional repository is a set of services that a university offers to the members of its community for the management and dissemination of digital materials created by the institution and its community members. It is most essentially an organizational commitment to the stewardship of these digital materials, including long-term preservation where appropriate, as well as organization and access or distribution.\"\n\nBesides archiving research output institutional repositories can perform the functions such as knowledge management, research assessment and showcasing an institution's research output.\n\nThe content of an institutional repository depends on the focus of the institution. Higher education institutions conduct research across multiple disciplines, thus research from a variety of academic subjects. Examples of such digital institutional repositories include the MIT Institutional Repository. A disciplinary repository is subject specific. It holds and provides access to scholarly research in a particular discipline. While there can be disciplinary repositories for one institution, disciplinary repositories are frequently not tied to a specific institution. The PsyDok digital repository for example holds German language research in psychology. SSOAR is an international social science full text-server.\n\nInstitutional repositories that provide access to research to users outside the institutional community are one of the recommended ways to achieve the open access vision described in the Budapest Open Access Initiative definition of open access. This is sometimes referred to as the self-archiving or \"green\" route to open access.\n\nRepository 66 is a mashup that indicates the worldwide locations of open access digital repositories. It is based on data provided by ROAR and the OpenDOAR service developed by SHERPA.\n\nAn institutional repository has been understood as a means to ensure that the published work of scholars is available to the academic community even after increases in subscription fees or budget cuts within libraries. The majority of research scholars do not provide free access to their research output to their colleagues in an organization. Institutional repositories provide scholars with a common platform so that everyone in the institution can contribute scholarly material to promote cross-campus interdisciplinary research. The development of an institutional repository redefines the production and dissemination of scholarly material within an academic community. The contents available on the institute’s website usually are removed after a few weeks. An institutional repository can provide a platform to manage institutional information, including web content. Institutional repositories have a number of benefits, including access to resources, visibility of research, and presentations of the contents.\n\nIf an institution has decided to invest in a repository numerous resources exist to help librarians and other repository managers frame and answer such questions, including \"A Librarian's Process for Building an Institutional Repository\",\n\nThe major institutional repository software platforms use a common open standard called OAI-PMH. This standard makes it not just possible to collect and move research output from one platform to another.\n\nWhile a majority of the institutions run institutional repository software on local servers, among new adopters, there is a strong preference towards cloud-based services. A survey commissioned by Duraspace found that 72% of respondents indicated that their institutional repository is a hosted service. Institutions are choosing cloud-based solutions because such providers \"enable institutions to easily get started with a hosted software service, with no need to provision local hardware, software, staff, or other infrastructure nor is there any specific technical skill or expertise required\". Also important to the decision to go hosted may be the understanding that a hosted institutional repository solution \"frees a library from both hardware and software support, allowing staff resources to be directed to other publishing service functions such as consulting and workflow design.\"\n\nThe Confederation of Open Access Repositories (COAR) states in its manifesto that \"Each individual repository is of limited value for research: the real power of Open Access lies in the possibility of connecting and tying together repositories, which is why we need interoperability. In order to create a seamless layer of content through connected repositories from around the world, open access relies on interoperability, the ability for systems to communicate with each other and pass information back and forth in a usable format. Interoperability allows us to exploit today's computational power so that we can aggregate, data mine, create new tools and services, and generate new knowledge from repository content.\"\n\nInteroperability is achieved in the world of institutional repositories using protocols to which repositories should conform, such as OAI-PMH. This allows search engines and open access aggregators, such as BASE and CORE, to index repository metadata and content and provide value-added services on top of this content.\n\nThe Digital Commons Network aggregates by discipline some 500 institutional repositories running on the Bepress Digital Commons platform. It includes more that two million full-text objects.\n\n\n\n"}

A process in which minority groups adopt, at various levels, the lifestyle, language, culture, political and other characteristics of the dominant group in Israel – Israeli-born secular Jews.\n\nThe term is mostly used to describe the changes in the lifestyle and culture of the Arab citizens of Israel since Israel's creation. In this context, the term \"Palestinization\" is used to describe the opposite process – resistance from being overtaken by Israelisation proponents and strengthening political and cultural ties with Palestinians living beyond the Green Line. However, sociologist Majid Al-Haj suggests these are not contradictory processes, and that there is an emergence of two parallel identities among Arab citizens of Israel which he called \"Politicization\". The equivalent term in Arabic is \"Asralah\" (أسرلة) derived from the name of \"Israel\" in Arabic (إسرائيل - Aisraail).\n\nIsraelization has been noted amongst the Druze community in Israel. One study noted a trend whereas the post-1950 Druze generation the younger the generation is, the likelier that there is a preference for Hebrew instead of Arabic with many younger Druze using social media having a near absence of Arabic usage amongst other Druze peers.\n\nThe term \"Israelization\" is also used occasionally to describe the social and political changes in Haredi society in Israel, in particular to describe integration into the Israeli political system, their increasing use of the general media in the Hebrew language, integration into the Israeli labor market etc. In addition, it is sometimes used to describe the assimilation of Jewish immigrants to Israel (Aliyah) among the native-born Israelis and amongst the veterans Jewish immigrants.\n"}

{"id": "564239", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=564239", "title": "Land of Oz", "text": "Land of Oz\n\nThe fictional Land of Oz is a magical country first introduced in the classic children's novel \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" (1900).\n\nOz consists of four vast quadrants, the Gillikin Country in the north, Quadling Country in the south, Munchkin Country in the east and Winkie Country in the west. Each province has its own ruler, but the realm itself has always been ruled by a single monarch. After \"The Marvelous Land of Oz\", this monarch is Princess Ozma.\n\nOriginally, Baum did not intend for \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" to have any sequels, but it achieved a greater popularity than any of the other fairylands he created, including the land of Merryland in Baum's children's novel \"Dot and Tot in Merryland\", written a year later. Due to Oz's worldwide success, Baum decided to return to it four years after \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" was published. For the next two decades, he described and expanded upon the land in the Oz Books, a series which introduced many fictional characters and creatures. Baum intended to end the series with the sixth Oz book \"The Emerald City of Oz\" (1910), in which Oz is forever sealed off and made invisible to the outside world, but this did not sit well with fans, and he quickly abandoned the idea, writing eight more successful Oz books, and even naming himself the \"Royal Historian of Oz.\"\n\nIn all, Baum wrote fourteen best-selling children's books about Oz and its enchanted inhabitants, as well as a spin off-series of six early readers. After his death in 1919, author Ruth Plumly Thompson, illustrator John R. Neill (who had previously collaborated with Baum on his Oz books) and several other writers and artists continued the series. There are now over 50 novels based upon Baum's original Oz saga.\n\nBaum characterized Oz as a real place, unlike MGM's 1939 musical movie adaptation, which presents it as a dream of lead character Dorothy Gale. According to the Oz books, it is a hidden fairyland cut off from the rest of the world by the Deadly Desert.\n\nThe canonical demonym for Oz is \"Ozite\". The term appears in \"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz\", \"The Road to Oz\", and \"The Emerald City of Oz\". Elsewhere in the canon, \"Ozmie\" is also used. In the animated 1974 semi-sequel to the MGM film, \"Journey Back to Oz\", \"Ozonian\" is used. The term \"Ozian\" appears in the script for the Royal Shakespeare Company's stage adaptation of the MGM movie and in the non-canonical modern work \"Wicked\". \"Ozmite\" was used in Reilly & Lee marketing in the 1920s, which has suggested to some critics that \"Ozmie\" may have been a typographical error.\n\nOz is, in the first book \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\", distinguished from Dorothy's native Kansas by not being civilized; this explains why Kansas does not have witches and wizards, while Oz does. In the third book, \"Ozma of Oz\", Oz is described as a \"fairy country\", new terminology that remained to explain its wonders.\n\nOz is roughly rectangular in shape, and divided along the diagonals into four countries: Munchkin Country (but commonly referred to as 'Munchkinland' in adaptations) in the East, Winkie Country in the West (sometimes West and East are reversed on maps of Oz, see West and East below), Gillikin Country in the North, and Quadling Country in the South. In the center of Oz, where the diagonals cross, is the fabled Emerald City, capital of the land of Oz and seat to the monarch of Oz, Princess Ozma.\n\nThe regions have a color schema: blue for Munchkins, yellow for Winkies, red for Quadlings, green for the Emerald City, and (in works after the first) purple for the Gillikins, which region was also not named in the first book. (This contrasts with Kansas; Baum, describing it, used \"gray\" nine times in four paragraphs.) In \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\", this is merely the favorite color, used for clothing and other man-made objects, and having some influence on their choice of crops, but the basic colors of the world are natural colors. The effect is less consistent in later works. In \"The Marvelous Land of Oz\", the book states that everything in the land of the Gillikins is purple, including the plants and mud, and a character can see that he is leaving when the grass turns from purple to green, but it also describes pumpkins as orange and corn as green in that land. Baum, indeed, never used the color schema consistently; in many books, he alluded to the colors to orient the characters and readers to their location, and then did not refer to it again. His most common technique was to depict the man-made articles and flowers as the color of the country, leaving leaves, grass, and fruit their natural colors.\n\nMost of these regions are settled with prosperous and contented people. However, this naturally is lacking in scope for plot. Numerous pockets throughout the Land of Oz are cut off from the main culture, for geographic or cultural reasons. Many have never heard of Ozma, making it impossible for them to acknowledge her as their rightful queen. These regions are concentrated around the edges of the country, and constitute the main settings for books that are set entirely within Oz. \"The Lost Princess of Oz\", for instance is set entirely in rough country in Winkie Country, between two settled areas. In \"Glinda of Oz\", Ozma speaks of her duty to discover all these stray corners of Oz.\n\nIn \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\", a yellow brick road leads from the lands of the Munchkins to the Emerald City. Other such roads featured in other works: one from Gillikin Country in \"The Marvelous Land of Oz\", and a second one from Munchkin Land in \"The Patchwork Girl of Oz\".\n\nOz is completely surrounded on all four sides by a desert which insulates the citizens of the Land of Oz from discovery and invasion. In the first two books, this is merely a natural desert, with only its extent making it dangerous to the traveler, but in \"The Road to Oz\" it is said to turn anyone who touches it to sand. Indeed, in \"The Marvelous Land of Oz\", Mombi tries to escape through it and Glinda chases her over the sands. Still, it is the dividing land between the magic of Oz and the outside world, and the Winged Monkeys can not obey Dorothy's command to carry her home because it would take them outside the lands of Oz. In \"Ozma of Oz\", it has become a magical desert called the Deadly Desert with life-destroying sands and noxious fumes, a feature that remained constant through the rest of the series, although no actual destruction is depicted in the Oz books, unlike in the film \"Return to Oz\". The desert has nonetheless been breached numerous times, both by children from our world (mostly harmless), by the Wizard of Oz himself, and by more sinister characters, such as the Nome King, who attempted to conquer Oz. After such an attempt in \"The Emerald City of Oz\", the book ends with Glinda creating a barrier of invisibility around the Land of Oz, for further protection. This was, indeed, an earnest effort on Baum's part to end the series, but the insistence of readers meant the continuation of the series, and therefore the discovery of many ways for people to pass through this barrier as well as over the sands. Despite this continual evasion, the barrier itself remained; nowhere in any Oz book did Baum hint that the inhabitants were even considering removing the magical barrier.\n\nThe first known map of Oz was a glass slide used in Baum's \"Fairylogue and Radio-Play\" traveling show, showing the blue land of the Munchkins in the east and the yellow land of the Winkies in the west. These directions are confirmed by the text of all of Baum's Oz books, especially the first, in which the Wicked Witch of the East rules over the Munchkins, and the Wicked Witch of the West rules over the Winkies.\n\nLike traditional western maps, the \"Fairylogue and Radio-Play\" map showed the west on the left, and the east on the right. However, the first map of Oz to appear in an Oz book had those directions reversed, and the compass rose adjusted accordingly. It is believed that this is a result of Baum copying the map from the wrong side of the glass slide, effectively getting a mirror image of his intended map. When he realized he was copying the slide backward, he reversed the compass rose to make the directions correct. However, an editor at Reilly and Lee reversed the compass rose, thinking he was fixing an error, and resulting in further confusion. Most notably, this confused Ruth Plumly Thompson, who frequently reversed directions in her own Oz books as a result.\n\nAnother speculation stems from the original conception of Oz, which at first appeared to be situated in an American desert. If Baum thought of the country of the Munchkins as the nearest region to him, it would have been in the east while he lived in Chicago, but when he moved to California, it would have been in the west.\n\nModern maps of Oz are almost universally drawn with the Winkies in the west and the Munchkins in the east, although west and east often appear reversed. Many Oz fans believe this is the correct orientation, perhaps as a result of Glinda's spell, which has the effect of confusing most standard compasses; perhaps resembling its similarity to the world Alice found through the looking glass in which everything was a mirror image; or perhaps just reflecting the alien nature of Oz. In Robert A. Heinlein's book \"The Number of the Beast\" he posits that Oz is on a retrograde planet, meaning that it spins in the opposite direction of Earth so that the sun seems to rise on one's left as one faces north. March Laumer's \"The Magic Mirror of Oz\" attributes the changes to a character named Till Orangespiegel attempting to turn the Land of Oz orange.\n\nOz, like all of Baum's fantasy countries, was presented as existing as part of the real world, albeit protected from civilization by natural barriers. Indeed, in the first books, nothing indicated that it was not hidden in the deserts of the United States. It gradually acquired neighboring magical countries, often from works of Baum's that had been independent, as Ix from \"Queen Zixi of Ix\", and Mo from \"The Magical Monarch of Mo\". The first of these is Ev, introduced in \"Ozma of Oz\".\nIn \"Tik-Tok of Oz\", Baum included maps in the endpapers which definitively situated Oz on a continent with its neighboring countries. Oz is the largest country on the continent unofficially known as Nonestica (this name was proposed by Robert R. Pattrick for the whole of the countries surrounding Oz; Pattrick proposed \"Ozeria\" for the whole continent, but that name is generally unused in fan discussions), which also includes the countries of Ev, Ix, and Mo, which has also been known as Phunniland, among others. Nonestica is, according to the map, in the Nonestic Ocean. A fair amount of evidence in the books point to this continent as being envisioned as somewhere in the southern Pacific Ocean. At the opening of \"Ozma of Oz,\" Dorothy Gale is sailing to Australia with her Uncle Henry when she is washed overboard (in a chicken coop, with Billina the yellow hen), and lands on the shore of Ev—a rare instance in which an outsider reaches the Oz landmass through non-magical (or \"apparently\" non-magical) means. Palm trees grow outside the Royal Palace in the Emerald City, and horses are not native to Oz, both points of consistency with a South-Pacific location; illustrations and descriptions of round-shaped and domed Ozite houses suggest a non-Western architecture. Conversely, Oz has technological, architectural, and urban elements typical of Europe and North America around the turn of the twentieth century; but this may involve cultural input from unusual external sources (see History below). Ruth Plumly Thompson asserts in her first Oz book, \"The Royal Book of Oz\", that the language of Oz is English, which also suggests European or American influence.\n\nAn argument against the South Pacific is that the seasons in Oz are shown as the same seasons in the United States at the same time. In addition, in \"The Wishing Horse of Oz\", Pigasus follows the North Star when he flies to Thunder Mountain, which could only be done in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nBaum's creation of the Emerald City may have been inspired by the White City of the World Columbian Exposition, which he visited frequently. Its quick building, in less than a year, may have been an element in the quick construction of the Emerald City in the first book.\n\nSchematically, Oz is much like the United States, with the Emerald City taking the place of Chicago: to the East, mixed forest and farmland; to the West, treeless plains and fields of wheat; to the South, warmth and lush growth, and red earth.\n\nRuth Plumly Thompson took a different direction with her Oz books, introducing European elements such as the title character of \"The Yellow Knight of Oz\", a knight straight out of Arthurian Legend.\n\nAt the time of \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\", the lands in the North, South, East and West of Oz are each ruled by a Witch. The Witches of the North and South are good, while the Witches of the East and West are wicked. Glinda (the Good Witch of the South) is later revealed to be the most powerful of the four, although later Oz books reveal that the Wicked Witch of the West was so powerful, even Glinda feared her. After Dorothy's house crushes the Wicked Witch of the East, thereby liberating the Munchkins from bondage, the Good Witch of the North tells Dorothy that she (the Witch of the North) is not as powerful as the Wicked Witch of the East had been, or she would have freed the Munchkins herself.\n\nDuring the first scene in Oz in \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\", the Good Witch of the North (Locasta or Tattypoo) explains to Dorothy that Oz still has witches and wizards, not being civilized, and goes on to explain that witches and wizards can be both good and evil, unlike the evil witches that Dorothy had been told of. That book contained only the four witches (besides the humbug wizard), but despite Ozma's prohibition on magic, many more magicians feature in later works.\n\nBaum tended to capitalize the word \"Witch\" when referring to the Witches of the North, South, East or West, but did not do so when referring to witches in general. For example, in the aforementioned first scene of \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\", Locasta (or Tattypoo) thanks Dorothy for killing the \"Wicked Witch of the East\", and introduces herself as \"the Witch of the North\", with the word \"Witch\" capitalized in both cases. However, when she goes on to tell Dorothy that \"I [the Witch of the North] am a good witch, and the people love me\", the word \"witch\" is not capitalized.\n\nWhite is the traditional color of witches in Oz. The Good Witch of the North wears a pointed white hat and a white gown decorated with stars, while Glinda, the Good Witch of the South (called a \"sorceress\" in later books), wears a pure white dress. Dorothy is taken for a witch not only because she had killed the Wicked Witch of the East, but because her dress is blue and white checked.\n\nOzma, once on the throne, prohibits the use of magic by anyone other than Glinda the Good, the Wizard of Oz, and herself – as, earlier, the Good Witch of the North had prohibited magic by any other witch in her domains. The illicit use of magic is a frequent feature of villains in later works in the series, appearing in \"The Scarecrow of Oz\", \"Rinkitink in Oz\", \"The Lost Princess of Oz\", \"The Tin Woodman of Oz\", and \"The Magic of Oz\".\n\nThere are different kinds of animals living in Oz. According to Baum, all animals in Oz have the ability to speak because it is a \"fairy\" kingdom. When asked by his readers why Dorothy's dog Toto did not speak, Baum insisted that he had the ability to, but did not choose to speak, but he finally does so in \"Tik-Tok of Oz\".\n\nAmong the many animals in Oz are:\n\n\nThere is a multitude of other races living in the land of Oz, many of which only appear once. Among the known races are:\n\n\nOutside of them are many other strange races who are often found living in the wilderness of Oz. Despite the overlordship of Ozma, many of the communities live autonomously. Oz has great tolerance for eccentricity and oddness.\n\nMany characters in Oz are animated objects. Such figures as the Glass Cat, the Scarecrow, Jack Pumpkinhead, the Sawhorse, and others are common. Entire regions are the homes of such animated beings. The Dainty China Country is entirely filled with creatures made of china, who would freeze into figurines if removed. The China Princess lives in fear of breaking because she would never be as pretty again, even if repaired.\n\nMany other characters are highly individual, even unique members of a species. Many such people from the outer worlds find refuge in Oz, which is highly tolerant of eccentricity.\n\nThe history of Oz prior to \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" (often called the prehistory of Oz as it takes place before Baum's \"histories\") is often the subject of dispute, as Baum himself gave conflicting accounts. In \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\", the title character recounts that he was a ventriloquist and a circus balloonist from Omaha, and during one flight the rope for his parachute vent became tangled, preventing him from descending until the next morning, and he awoke to find that he was floating over a strange land. When he landed, the people thought he was a great wizard because of his ability to fly. He did not disabuse them of this notion, and with his new power over them, he had them build a city with a palace in the center of Oz. He also ordered them to wear green glasses so it would appear to be made entirely of emeralds. However, in the later Oz books the city is depicted as actually being made of emerald or other green materials. The Wizard was a young man when he first arrived in Oz, and grew old while he was there. Afraid of the Wicked Witches of the West and the East, who, unlike him, could do real magic, the Wizard hid away in a room of his palace and refused to see visitors. He lived in this way until the arrival of Dorothy in the first book.\n\nIn \"The Marvelous Land of Oz\" the prehistory was changed slightly. Glinda, the Good Witch of the South, reveals that the Wizard usurped the previous king of Oz Pastoria and hid away his daughter Ozma. This was Baum's reaction to the popular 1903 Broadway extravaganza Baum adapted from his book, \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\", in which the Wizard took the role of the main antagonist and the Wicked Witch of the West was left out.\n\nThe Wizard, however, had been more popular with his readers than he thought. In \"Ozma of Oz\", he omitted any mention of the Wizard's having usurped the throne of Ozma's father, but the largest changes occurred in the next book.\n\nIn the preface to \"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz\", Baum remarks that the Wizard had turned out to be a popular character with the children who had read the first book and so he brought the Wizard back. During it, the Wizard relates yet another account of his history in Oz, telling Ozma that his birth name was Oscar Zoroaster Phadrig Isaac Norman Henkle Emmanuel Ambroise Diggs, which, being a very long and cumbersome name, and as his other initials spelled out \"PINHEAD,\" he preferred to leave just as O.Z. The balloon part of his story was unchanged, except for the detail added by Ozma, that the people probably saw his initials on his balloon and took them as a message that he was to be their king. She relates that the country was already named Oz (a word which in their language means \"great and good\"), and that it was typical for the rulers to have names that are variations of Oz (King Pastoria being a notable exception to this rule).\n\nOzma elaborates further, saying that there were once four Wicked Witches in Oz, who leagued together to depose the King, but the Wicked Witches of the North and South were defeated by Good Witches before the Wizard arrived in Oz. According to this version, the King at the time was Ozma's grandfather. This version of prehistory restores the Wizard's reputation, but adds the awkwardness of both Ozma and her father having been born in captivity.\n\nIn \"The Tin Woodman of Oz\" Baum writes how Oz came to be a fairyland:\nThenceforward, no one in Oz would ever age, get sick, or die. After becoming a fairyland, Oz harbored many Witches, Magicians, and Sorcerers until the time when Ozma made magic illegal without a permit. In yet another inconsistency, it is implied that Ozma was the fairy left behind by Queen Lurline to rule the country, contradicting the story where she was Pastoria's daughter. This is later confirmed in \"Glinda of Oz\":\n\nWhile this explains why no one dies or ages, and nevertheless there are people of differing ages in Oz, it is completely inconsistent with the earlier versions of the prehistory.\n\nMaguire, author of \"\" addresses this inconsistency by saying that the people of Oz believe that Ozma is reincarnated—that her spirit was left behind by Lurline, but her body is reborn to different mortal queens.\n\nIn Jack Snow's \"The Magical Mimics in Oz\", the prehistory story is retold. This version relates that Ozma was given to the king of Oz as an adoptive daughter, for he was old and had no children.\n\nIn the Magic Land stories of Alexander Melentyevich Volkov, the prehistory is quite different. The land was created 6,000–7,000 years ago by a wizard named Hurricap, who was tired of people coming to him with requests, so he decided to find a place without them annoying him. He found a remote land and separated it from the rest of the world, along with putting the enchantments of eternal spring and talking animals (Volkov's version doesn't include any forms of immortality). However, he failed to notice that the land already contained people (since he was a giant, already suffering from nearsightedness in his advanced age, and the people in the Magic Land were much shorter than in other places), but, upon discovering the fact, decided that removing the enchantments would be unnecessary. Instead, he ordered the people to keep away from his castle. After that, the notable events included a conquest attempt by a sorceress named Arachna (Gurrikap was still alive, and put her in an enchanted sleep for 5,000 years. Her awakening formed the story for the fifth book in Volkov's series), an unsuccessful coup by a prince named Bofaro to overthrow his father about 1,000 years ago (He and his accomplices were banished to a cave and became the Magic Land's main source of metal and gems, an analogue to the Nomes), and the arrival of the Four Witches (which only occurred about 500 years ago in this continuity).\n\nEventually, Dorothy Gale and her whole house are blown into Oz from Kansas by a tornado. When the house lands, it crushes the Wicked Witch of the East (in Gregory Maguire's book, \"\", she is given a name, Nessarose), ruler of the Munchkins. In an attempt to get back to her home, she journeys to the Emerald City. Along the way, she meets the Tin Woodman, the Cowardly Lion, and the Scarecrow, all of whom accompany her. Once there, they become the first people to gain an audience with the Wizard since he went into seclusion, although he disguises himself because Dorothy now has the Wicked Witch of the East's magic silver shoes, and he is afraid of her. The Wizard sends Dorothy and her party to destroy the Wicked Witch of the West and in exchange promises to grant her request to be sent home. Surprisingly, Dorothy \"destroys\" the Witch by throwing a pail of water on her, causing her to melt. Defeated, the Wizard reveals to the group that he is in fact not a real wizard and has no magical powers, but he promises to grant Dorothy's wish and take her home himself in his balloon. He leaves the Scarecrow in his place to rule Oz.\n\nFinally, it is discovered that the wizard had given the daughter of the last king of Oz, Princess Ozma, to the old witch Mombi to have her hidden away. Mombi had turned Ozma into a boy named Tip, whom she raised. When all of this is revealed Tip is turned back into Ozma and takes her rightful place as the benevolent ruler of all of Oz. Ozma successfully wards off several attempts by various armies to overthrow her. To prevent any upheaval of her rule over Oz, she outlaws the practice of all magic in Oz except by herself, the returned and reformed wizard, and by Glinda, and she has Glinda make all of Oz invisible to outsiders. Ozma remains the ruler of Oz for the entire series.\n\nSome political analysts have claimed that Oz is a thinly disguised socialist utopia, though some Baum scholars disagree. Advocates of this theory support it using this quotation from \"The Emerald City of Oz\":\n\nThis is a revision of the original society: in the first two books, the people of Oz lived in a money-based economy. For instance, the people of the Emerald City use \"green pennies\" as coinage. Money was not abolished in the course of the series, but excised from the conception of Oz. Indeed, in \"The Magic of Oz\", a character from Oz gets into trouble when he goes to Ev because he was unaware of the concept of money. This decision to remove money from Oz may reflect Baum's own financial difficulties in the times when he was writing these books.\n\nSince Oz is ruled by a monarch, benevolent though she may be, Oz is closer in nature to an absolute monarchy than a communist or Marxist state. When she was first introduced, Ozma was the monarch specifically of the Emerald City, but in the description of \"Ozma of Oz\", Oz is presented as a federal state, rather like the German Empire, in monarchies rather than republics: having an overall ruler in Ozma, and individual kings and queens of smaller portions.\n\nThe society grew steadily more utopian, in that its peace and prosperity were organized, but from the first book, it was a stupendously wealthy country, in contrast to Kansas's crop failures, droughts, and mortgages—just as it also is colorful to contrast with Kansas's gray. On the other hand, despite the presence of the Emerald City, Oz is an agrarian country, similar to Kansas; the story has been interpreted as a populist parable, and certainly contains many populist themes.\n\nIn \"The Wonder City of Oz\", Princess Ozma (called \"Queen Ozma\" in this book) is seen running for election (\"ozlection\") to her office as ruler against Jenny Jump, a half-fairy newcomer from New Jersey. However, this book was not written by Baum, but by John R. Neill, Baum's second successor. Further, the concept of the \"ozlection\" was not in Neill's manuscript for the book, but was added by an editor at Reilly and Lee, the publisher.\n\nAt times the rulers of Oz's territories have grander titles than would normally be customary, but this is done mostly for the satisfaction of the incumbents. The ruler of the Winkie Country is the Emperor, the Tin Woodman. The ruler of the Quadling Country is Glinda the Good. The Munchkin Country is ruled by a king, later identified as Cheeriobed, who is revealed to be married to the Good Witch of the North, who, a spell broken, abdicates leadership of the Gillikin Country to Joe King and Queen Hyacinth of Up Town.\n\nThe Royal Flag of Oz is based on the map of the Land of Oz; the four colors represent the four countries, and the green star represents the Emerald City.\n\nOz is mostly a peaceful land and the idea of subversion is largely unknown to its people. Most military positions are only formal. This has caused many problems, such as in \"The Marvelous Land of Oz\" when the Emerald City (which was only guarded by an elderly doorman and one soldier who was the entire Army of Oz at the time) was easily conquered by the Army of Revolt led by General Jinjur. This army was in turn overwhelmed by another army of girls led by Glinda.\n\nSecurity of Oz is mostly maintained by magic such as Glinda's spell making Oz completely invisible. Oz also has a natural barrier in the form of a desert that surrounds the land: anyone who touches the desert turns to sand. The Nome King has tried to conquer Oz on several occasions. A nominal army once existed, but it had an extremely large officers/privates ratio; other than its commander the Tin Woodman and one private, the portion of it seen in \"Ozma of Oz\" was composed entirely of cowardly officers. In the end of the book it was said that there are three privates all in all, and it is unknown how many—if any—officers were left at home during Ozma's travel to Ev. The private seen in the book, named Omby Amby, is later promoted to Captain General.\n\nIn the book \"Emerald City of Oz\", there are 2 towns called Rigmarole Town and Flutterbudgets that are the defensive settlements of Oz.\n\nIn the movie \"Return to Oz,\" the mechanical man Tik-Tok is the entire Royal Army of Oz.\n\nAttempts by outsiders to conquer the Land of Oz are frequent, particularly in the Oz books by Ruth Plumly Thompson. But these attempts are always successfully thwarted in the end, usually by Ozma or by forces sympathetic to her.\n\nRecurring characters in the classic Oz series include:\n\n\nThe Land of Oz as portrayed in the classic MGM musical movie of 1939, is quite different from that portrayed in Baum's books. The most notable difference is that in the film the entire land of Oz appears to be dreamed up by Dorothy Gale (thus making it a dream world), although, Dorothy earnestly corrects the adults at the end that she was indeed there, and an image of Dorothy's falling farmhouse returning to earth is presented. The apparent message is that one should appreciate one's home, no matter how dull it may look or uninteresting its surroundings may be, for having a home and a family is not something that should be taken for granted. This contrasts sharply with the books, in which Dorothy and her family are eventually invited to move to Oz due to a bank foreclosure on the farm, showing both that Oz is a real place, and that it is a utopia compared to the prairies of Kansas.\n\nThere are many other small differences between the books and the movie. For example, when Dorothy arrives in Munchkinland the Munchkins are seen wearing colorful costumes, but in the book Munchkins are said to only wear blue as blue is the official dominant color of the east. The first witch Dorothy meets in Oz in the book is the Good Witch of the North, a minor character that only had one other appearance in Baum's books but is an important figure of Oz nonetheless. In the movie this character is conflated with that of Glinda, who is the Good Witch of the South and does not make an appearance until the very end of Baum's story. The character of Glinda in the books dresses in all white silk, as white is the traditional color for good witches, whereas in the film she is seen in pink.\n\nIt is also worthy of note that the Dorothy of the books is only a little girl who is no older than twelve-years-old. However, she is mature and very resourceful, only crying when faced with ultimate despair, whereas the older Dorothy of the movie (portrayed as a twelve-year-old by sixteen-year-old Judy Garland) spends several portions of the film crying and being told by others what to do, however her fear was overshadowed by the Cowardly Lion's. This is more consistent with Thompson's portrayal of Dorothy—Baum is known for his strong and independent female characters.\n\nThe Wicked Witch of the West also changes significantly between books and movie. In the books no mention is ever made of her skin color, whereas in the movie she is green without explanation, although the Winkies she has enslaved and turned into soldiers are also green. In the book it is implied but not stated that she dresses in yellow, as yellow is the official dominant color of the Winkie Country where she rules, whereas in the movie she dresses entirely in black. In the book she is portrayed as having only one eye, which is so powerful it could see distant objects like a telescope, but in the movie she uses a crystal ball to watch Dorothy and her friends from afar. The 1939 MGM film makes the first reference to The Witches of the East and West being sisters, which was not the case in the book; none of the Witches in Baum's Oz are related.\n\nThe Wizard of Oz does not resort to anywhere near as much trickery in the movie as the book. In the book he entertains each member of Dorothy's party on a different day, and takes a different form for each; appearing as a giant green head, a beautiful fairy, a great beast, and a levitating ball of fire. In the movie he takes only one of these forms—that of the giant green head.\n\nThe nature of the Emerald City is changed in the film. In the book, the city is not actually all green, but everyone is forced to wear green tinted spectacles (ostensibly to protect their eyes from the glory and splendor of the luxurious city), thus making everything appear green. In the film, the city is actually all green. The architecture of the Emerald City in the movie uses a much more contemporary Art Deco style than Baum could have imagined. In the book, a giant green wall studded in glittering emeralds surrounds the entire city, whereas in the movie there is only a gate opening.\n\nThe movie replaces the charmed Silver Shoes with pointed toes of the book with Ruby-Red Slippers. This was because full color motion pictures were still a relatively new technology in 1939, and MGM wanted to show off the visually dazzling process. Shiny red shoes were more impressive in a color motion picture compared to silver ones. Due to the popularity of the movie, the green witch and the Ruby Slippers are more well known to the general public and pop culture than their book counterparts, and are even considered iconic.\n\nIn his revisionist Oz novels \"\", \"Son of a Witch\", \"A Lion Among Men\" and \"Out of Oz\", Gregory Maguire portrays a very different version of the Land of Oz. Maguire's Oz is not Baum's utopia, but a land troubled by political unrest and economic hardship. One political issue in Maguire's novels is the oppression of the Animals (Maguire distinguishes speaking Animals from non-speaking animals by the use of initial capital letters). There are many religious traditions in Maguire's Oz, including Lurlinism (which regards the Fairy Lurline as Oz's creator), Unionism, which worships the Unnamed God, and the pleasure faiths which had swept Oz during the time that the witches were at Shiz. An example of the pleasure faiths were tic-toc (where creatures were enchanted to tell secrets or the future and run by clockwork), and sorcery.\n\nMaguire's presentation of Oz's geography is also tinged with politics. A large political prison, Southstairs, exists in caverns below the Emerald City. Gillikin, home of Shiz University, has more industrial development than other parts of Oz. Munchkinland is Oz's breadbasket and at one point declares its independence from the rule of the Emerald City. Quadling Country is largely marshland, inhabited by the artistic and sexually free Quadlings. The Vinkus (Maguire's name for Winkie Country) is largely open grassland, populated by semi-nomadic tribes with brown skin.\n\nThe musical \"Wicked\", based on Maguire's first Oz novel, portrays an Oz slightly closer to the version seen in Baum's novels and the 1939 film. The oppression of the Animals is still a theme, but the geographical and religious divisions portrayed in Maguire's novel are barely present.\n\nIn both the book and musical, several characters from the traditional Oz stories are present with different names. Glinda is originally called Galinda, but changes her name. The Wicked Witch of the West is called Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the East is called Nessarose. In the musical, but not in the book, Boq becomes the Tin Man, and Fiyero becomes the Scarecrow.\n\nAlexander Melentyevich Volkov was a Russian author best known for his translation of \"The Wizard of Oz\" into Russian, and for writing his own original sequels, which were based only loosely on Baum's. Volkov's books have been translated into many other languages, and are better known than Baum's in some countries. The books, while still aimed at children, feature many mature political and ethical elements. They have been retranslated into English by Peter L. Blystone and partially by March Laumer, who used elements of them in his own books.\n\nMarch Laumer was one of the first authors to continue the Oz series after the Famous Forty. His books were written with the permission of Contemporary Books, who owned Reilly & Lee, the original publisher. His canon includes everything he knew of that was set in the land of Oz, including Volkov's Russian Oz, the MGM movie, the Disney sequel, and many of Baum's own books that most fans do not consider canonical.\n\nLaumer also made several controversial changes to Oz. He married off several of the major characters, often to unlikely prospects. For example, the intelligent and mature sorceress Glinda was married to Button Bright, who had been a small and dim-witted child throughout Baum's books. He also aged Dorothy to a teenager to make her a romantic prospect for several characters, made Ozma a lesbian based on her upbringing as a boy, and made the Shaggy Man an ephebophile based on his frequent travels with young girls.\n\nLaumer's books do not portray one consistent version of Oz. Because most of his books were collaborations, he often included elements of other author's visions of Oz which may have been inconsistent with his own. For example, while he explicitly made Dorothy sixteen in \"A Fairy Queen in Oz\", he had her physically eight in \"Aunt Em and Uncle Henry in Oz\"; and while he portrayed Volkov's Oz as a parallel universe in \"Farewell to Oz\" he also showed Volkov's characters living in Baum's Oz in many of his other books, such as \"Aunt Em and Uncle Henry in Oz\". Despite these discrepancies, many of his books are consistent with each other, and characters introduced in some often appear in others.\n\nPhilip José Farmer portrays a very different Oz in his book \"A Barnstormer in Oz\". The premise is that nothing after the first book occurred—Dorothy never returned to Oz, and instead grew up, got married, and had a son. Her son, Hank Stover, is the main character, a World War I veteran flier and the titular barnstormer. While flying in his Curtiss JN-4 biplane he enters a green haze and emerges in the civil war-stricken land of Oz.\n\nFarmer portrays the land of Oz as a science fiction author, attempting to explain scientifically many of the \"magical\" elements of Baum's story.\n\nRobert A. Heinlein's book, \"The Number of the Beast\", passes through many famous fictional worlds including those of \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\"; \"Gulliver's Travels\", specifically Lilliput; E.E. \"Doc\" Smith's Lensman universe; Asgard, connected to Heinlein's own Future History universe by the Rainbow Bridge for one specific reason in one specific location; and Ringworld; as well as some of Heinlein's own works, specifically those set in his Future History through which Lazarus Long moves; and of course the Land of Oz itself.\n\nThe Oz portrayed in the book is very close to Baum's Oz, although Heinlein does make an attempt to explain some things from the standpoint of a science fiction author. He explains that Oz is on a retrograde planet, where the direction of rotation relative to the poles is reversed, resulting in the sun seeming to rise in what would normally be the west.\n\nHeinlein also explains that the population remains steady in Oz despite the lack of death because it is impossible for children to be born in Oz. When the population does increase through immigration, Glinda just extends the borders an inch or two in each direction, which makes more than enough space for all additional people.\n\nL. Sprague de Camp, like Heinlein, brings his own characters to Oz in his book \"Sir Harold and the Gnome King\", part of the originally collaborative Harold Shea series. Unlike Heinlein, he does not attempt to explain Oz as science fiction, though he does deviate from the original corpus. He follows Thompson's Oz books, thus using her spelling of \"Gnome\" and her final fate of the character, but he postulates an incident that has removed the Ozites' immortality, with the result that both Ozma and Dorothy have aged and married by the time his story takes place.\n\nIn the Otherland series, by Tad Williams, a virtual reality version of Oz exists, wherein real-world antagonists play sadistic versions of the roles of the Tin Man, The Scarecrow, and the Cowardly Lion, in a twisted, martial, and post-apocalyptic version of Oz, populated both by characters from the novels, and a large quantity of male and female humans who go by the names \"Henry\" and \"Em\" respectively. The humans, computer-generated characters based on the lost minds of children drawn into the Otherland program, look forward to a messianic prophecy foretelling the coming of \"The Dorothy,\" where a child would be born among them.\n\nThe 2007 Sci Fi television miniseries \"Tin Man\" reinvents Oz as the Outer Zone (O.Z.), a parallel universe that was first visited by Dorothy Gale during the latter Victorian Era and is ruled over by her descendants. It is implied, by reference to centuries having elapsed since Dorothy came to the O.Z., that time has progressed at different rates in the O.Z. and \"the other side\". The re-imagined Oz is described as a place where \"the paint has peeled, and what was once the goodness of Oz has become the horrible bleakness of the O.Z.\" The scenic design of the O.Z. features elements of steampunk, particularly the \"1930's fascist realist\" decor of the evil sorceress's palace and the computer-generated Central City, analogue of the Emerald City.\n\nThe 2009 point-and-click adventure video game \"Emerald City Confidential\" reinvents Oz in a film noir style, with Dorothy Gale as a femme fatale, the Lion as a corrupt lawyer and some other changes.\n\nThe Land of Oz appears in the TV series \"Once Upon a Time\" and is the focus of the episodes \"It's Not Easy Being Green\", \"Kansas\", \"Heart of Gold\", \"Our Decay\", \"Ruby Slippers\", and the most recent episode \"Where Bluebirds Fly\". It was also seen briefly in the episode \"Sisters\".\n\nBeing a fantasy series Oz is rich in magic. In particular, there are many magic items which play an important role in the series.\n\nWhen Dorothy leaves Oz after having several adventures there and befriending many of Oz's natives, she is magically carried over the Deadly Desert by means of the charmed Silver Shoes she had been given shortly after her unexpected arrival when her farmhouse landed on and killed the previous pair's owner, the Wicked Witch of the East. After knocking her heels together three times and wishing to return home, Dorothy is lifted into the air and transported to Kansas. The shoes however, slip off of Dorothy's feet and are lost forever in the desert. Baum states the silver shoes are never recovered. In the 1939 film the shoes are changed to Ruby Slippers. When Dorothy clicks her heels together she closes her eyes and says: \"There's no place like home\". She then wakes up in her bedroom in Kansas believing her experience in Oz to be an elaborate dream.\n\nThe silver shoes and ruby slippers are also used in several other versions including \"Wicked\" by Gregory Maguire. Here the shoes are constructed as a gift and have a chameleon effect. They are decorated with thousands of glittering glass beads that change colors according to the lighting. They can also appear to be several different colors all at once. The shoes are also lost when Dorothy is teleported back home just like in Baum's novel. The Broadway musical based on Maguire's book further shows that they were all silver, but were changed to ruby red by a spell put upon them by the Witch of the West Elphaba, enabling her sister the Witch of the East Nessarose, who prior had been confined to a wheelchair, to magically walk.\n\nA little-known adaptation of the original story made for British television in the mid-90s starring Denise van Outen explained that they had belonged to a visitor from over the rainbow who came to Oz before Dorothy and they were obtained by the Witch when the visitor wished herself home and they fell off her feet on the return trip.\n\nThe Powder of Life is a magic substance from the book series, which first appears in \"The Marvelous Land of Oz\".\n\nIt is a magical powder that brings inanimate objects to life. The witch Mombi first obtained it from a \"crooked magician.\" Later in the series, it is revealed that the substance is made by a Dr. Pipt. In order to make the substance, Dr. Pipt had to stir four large cauldrons for six years. Only a few grains of the powder could be made at a time. It is always described as being carried in a pepper box.\n\nIn \"The Marvelous Land of Oz\", the Powder of Life was used to bring Jack Pumpkinhead, the Sawhorse, and the Gump to life. The first batch of the powder in Mombi's possession was activated by the following incantation and the action that had to be associated with:\n\n\nIn \"The Road to Oz\", the Dr. Pipt's sister Dyna activated the Powder of Life with a simple wish that brought the rug of her late blue bear pet to life.\n\nIn \"The Patchwork Girl of Oz\" it brings the title character to life, also the glass cat and a phonograph.\n\nMombi's shaker also contained three \"wishing pills\" fabricated by Dr. Nikidik.\n\nThe Powder has been used by Volkov in his series. There, it is produced from a certain plant of such viability that the smallest piece can grow into a plant within a day, on any surface except for solid metal. However, if it is sun-dried on such a surface, it turns into the Powder of Life. No incantation is required to make the powder work. The second book of the series is centered around a man who animates an army of wooden soldiers with the Powder and uses them for conquering the Magic Land.\n\nIn \"Return to Oz\", the magic words to bring the inanimate object to life were \"WEAUGH, TEAUGH, PEAUGH\".\n\nThe Magic Belt is first introduced in \"Ozma of Oz\". Originally the belt belonged to the Nome King, but Dorothy Gale stole it and defeated him. When she leaves Oz, she gives it to Ozma for safekeeping.\n\nIn most Oz books, the Magic Belt grants its wearer the ability to transform anyone into any form, and the ability to transport anyone anywhere, and also makes its wearer impervious to harm. In some books, it also grants limited wishes.\n\nIn \"Ozma of Oz\", its power is limited: its magic cannot affect objects which are made of wood.\n\nIn non-canonical \"The Oz Kids\" animated series, the Magic Belt belonged to Dot.\n\nIn Ozma's boudoir hangs a picture in a radium frame. This picture usually appears to be of a pleasant countryside, but when anyone wishes for the picture to show a particular person or place, the scene will display what is wished for. Sometimes the onlooker is able to hear sounds from the scene within the Magic Picture and sometimes an additional device is necessary to transmit sound.\n\nA similar device is present in Volkov's series. There, it is given as a present to the Scarecrow by the Good Witch of the South. It is a box of pink wood with a thick frosted glass screen. The device is password activated, and limited in range to the Magic Land (with the exception of deep caverns and certain types of magical interference). The box is shown to be virtually indestructible; it withstood repeated abuse from a villain attempting to use it.\n\nGlinda's Great Book of Records is introduced in Chapter 29 of \"The Emerald City of Oz\": \" 'It is a record of everything that happens,' replied the Sorceress. 'As soon as an event takes place, anywhere in the world, it is immediately found printed in my Magic Book. So when I read its pages I am well informed.' \" The Book proves useful in \"The Scarecrow of Oz\" and \"Glinda of Oz\"; and it recurs in many of the stories of Baum's successors and imitators. It is one of the prime magic devices of Oz; villains steal it when they can (as in \"The Lost Princess of Oz\" or in \"Handy Mandy in Oz\"). Since it covers the planet and not merely Oz, the Book's entries are compressed and sometimes cryptic, and difficult to decipher (as in \"Paradox in Oz\" or \"Queen Ann in Oz\").\n\nThe book is also featured in the fantasy series \"Once Upon a Time\". Zelena reads the book ignoring Glinda's warning and turns green again because she felt betrayed as it was mentioned in the book that Dorothy would save Oz from a great evil (Zelena thought that evil was her but this was never revealed).\n\nA rusty-looking horseshoe magnet which causes everyone to love its owner. It is closely associated with the Shaggy Man. In \"The Road to Oz\", he finds that being loved by everyone can be inconvenient. In \"Tik-Tok of Oz\" he reveals that Ozma has modified its powers so that it only works when it is displayed and affects only the feelings of those who see it. It is an essential plot-element in \"The Shaggy Man of Oz\". Ozma keeps it hanging over the gate into the Emerald City, so that all who enter will come with love, although this does not always seem to happen.\n\nThe Magic Fan is brought to Oz by Dorothy in \"The Royal Book of Oz\". Several subsequent books mention it. It creates a powerful wind, capable of blowing away an invading army.\n\nA fountain in the Emerald City, anyone who drinks from it forgets everything he knows, including his own name. It is used against the Nome King in \"The Emerald City of Oz\" and again in \"The Magic of Oz\".\n\nCreated by the Red Jinn, it summons a slave named Ginger, who appears bearing a tray full of delicious food when the bell is rung. Besides providing food, the bell also provides a means of escape from danger: anyone who holds onto the slave when he disappears after bringing the food is transported with him to the Red Jinn's castle. There are actually two magic dinner bells, one in the Emerald City and another which the Red Jinn keeps for himself and uses while traveling. The bell is first introduced in \"Jack Pumpkinhead of Oz\" and also appears in \"The Purple Prince of Oz\" and \"The Silver Princess in Oz\".\n\nIn the later Oz books, no one can die. One of the books assures us that while you are in the Land of Oz, you cannot die. Unfortunately, this information comes \"after\" characters in the books have been chopped into pieces, beheaded, melted, and so forth and it is mentioned that you could be transformed into an inanimate object, turned into sand, and buried. Even so, you would still be alive and presumably conscious.\n\nBaum puts it this way in the third chapter of \"The Emerald City of Oz\":\n\nThis passage has been translated by some fans to mean that one ceases to live if one's body is damaged to the extent that it cannot be repaired. However, in \"Tik-Tok of Oz\" Baum suggested that Oz people could go on living after being eaten and digested, and also that Nomes would continue to live after being cut into tiny pieces, which disproves the destruction theory.\n\nNote also the spell which caused this also prevented aging, and took effect on everyone in Oz at the same time; this means that any babies in Oz are eternally babies, and that anyone who was at the moment of death is permanently caught there, and so on.\n\nDeath is treated inconsistently; in some books it is said that it is impossible to die, in others, people die. Problematically, the plot often depends on something either dying, or not being killable.\n\n\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" shows an early example of the problem: although the Tin Woodman does not die when his limbs and head are severed, the two wicked witches are killed (the Wicked Witch of the East could be explained that she was simply crushed and not really dead, but could not do anything anyway, and in \"The Oz Odyssey\", the Wicked Witch of the West comes back to life). One theory brought forth as to why the Tin Woodman does not die is discussed in Edward Einhorn's book \"Paradox in Oz\", where King Oz says that the Tin Woodman (then Nick Chopper) would have died were it not for his time magic. When the Tin Woodman rescues the Queen of the Field Mice by chopping off the head of a pursuing wildcat, it seems unlikely the cat's unjoined head and body continue to live independently of each other, although this goes unmentioned. Again, although the Tin Woodman survived losing all his body, prior to that, he had grown up and lost his parents in a manner inconsistent with later descriptions of Oz. Again, in \"Ozma of Oz\", Jack Pumpkinhead was described as \"a little overripe\", and in \"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz\", he does not appear at all, although all the other characters do reappear; the implication is that he spoiled, as he feared from his creation. It is unlikely, however, since, according to the previous book, while a pumpkin which serves as Jack's head can spoil, it can be replaced, which was done several times without a problem.\n\nBoth \"Ozma of Oz\" and \"Tik-Tok of Oz\" describe trees with meat growing on them, so it is possible that no animal was killed for most of the meat eaten in Oz. However, in \"Tin Woodman of Oz\" a hungry Jaguar tries to eat a live monkey, suggesting that occasionally (among non-human animals, at least) animal flesh is preferred to that of plants.\n\nIn Oz, animals such as the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger can talk, and all native animals appear to be capable of speech. \"\" emphasized the difference between Animals and animals. Animals (capitalized) are sentient beings that can talk. Several theories exist as to how animals gained the gift of speech.\n\nThe treatment of non-native animals was inconsistent. In the first book, the dog Toto never speaks, although brought to Oz; in \"The Patchwork Girl of Oz\", Dorothy specifies that he cannot speak because he is not a fairy dog. However, in \"Ozma of Oz\", the chicken Billina acquires speech merely by being swept to the lands near Oz, and in \"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz\", the same is true of the kitten Eureka and the cab horse Jim when reaching the land of Mangaboos, a similarly magical land. In \"Tik-Tok of Oz\", Baum restored the continuity: Toto can speak, and always could, but never bothered to, because it was unnecessary.\n\nAn additional inconsistency is introduced with \"Tik-Tok of Oz\": Hank the Mule cannot speak until reaching the Land of Oz, although he lands on the shore of Ev first, where Billina the chicken gained the ability to speak. This might be because \"Tik-Tok of Oz\" was originally a stageplay version of \"Ozma of Oz\"; Dorothy was replaced by Betsy because he had sold the stage rights for Dorothy, and Billina was replaced by Hank because a mule could more convincingly be played by two people in a costume. Hank probably could not talk because Baum already had two speaking comedy characters, the Shaggy Man and Tik-Tok. Thus Hank would fill a better niche as a visual comedy character, in the tradition of British pantomime. The part of Hank was also an analog to the part of Dorothy's cow Imogene, Toto's replacement on stage in the immensely successful 1903 Broadway version of \"The Wizard of Oz\", a success that Baum sought to duplicate for the rest of his life.\n\nThere is one small kingdom in Oz where animals are unable to talk: Corumbia.\n\nA legend of uncertain validity is that when relating bedtime stories (the earliest form of the Oz books) Baum was asked by his niece, Ramona Baxter Bowden, the name of the magical land. He glanced at a nearby filing cabinet, which had three drawers, labeled A–G, H–N, and O–Z. Thus he named the land Oz. This story was first told in 1903, but his wife always insisted that the part about the filing cabinet was not true. In \"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz\", the name is translated as \"great and good\". It has also been speculated that Oz was named after the abbreviation for ounce, in the theory that Oz is an allegory for the populist struggle against the illusion (the wizard) of the gold standard.\n\nOthers have said that Oz stands for New York, since the letters of the alphabet before O and Z are N and Y respectively. However, this works just as well with Oz standing for Pennsylvania, because the letters following O and Z are P and A (starting again at the beginning of the alphabet).\n\nSeveral of Baum's fairy stories that take place in the United States were situated on the Ozark Plateau, and the similarity of name may not be a coincidence.\n\n\"Oz\" is a common vernacular contraction of \"Australia\" (Australia—Aussie—Aus—Oz). Australia is a large continent predominated by desert regions, with pockets of intense green tropical, sub-tropical and sub-alpine greenlands and rainforests. It is quite possible that Baum took the popular nickname of Australia as the national name for his fictional world. Also note that many fans place Oz in the South Pacific, see Location above. However, according to the Oxford English dictionary, the first references to Australia by this name were made in 1902—after the first book had been published. Nevertheless, spoken references would certainly have been in use before first appearing in print (as noted by Oxford), hence possibly before the writing of the book.\n\nIt is also possible that it is based on the \"Óg\" in Tír na nÓg. While no direct link between the mythology of Oz and the realm of Irish folklore has been conclusively proven, certain similarities, for instance Ogma and Princess Ozma, are compelling.\n\n"}

The LfL framework and principles have been used in a wide variety of contexts to frame discussions and to inform the evaluation of practice.\n\nThe Leadership for Learning Project (known as Carpe Vitam after its Swedish commissioning body) was a research and development project focusing on the process by which schools made, and then grew, the connections between learning and leadership. It was funded for three years (2002–2005) by the Wallenberg Foundation in Sweden, with further financial support from participating countries. The project was directed from the University of Cambridge in collaboration with eight different groups of university researchers and their nominated schools in eight cities: Athens, Brisbane, Copenhagen, Innsbruck, London, Oslo, Seattle, and Trenton (New Jersey).\nSeven countries, eight higher education institutions and 24 schools participated in exploring the connections between leadership and learning through conferences, workshops, school visits and inter-country exchanges.\n\nThe researchers did not start from a blank slate or from a neutral stance but from a set of democratic values about leadership and learning. How those values could be translated into practical strategies at school and classroom level, however, was something they planned to discover through experimentation, reflection and collective debate over the life of the project.\nPart way through that process they began to identify ‘principles for practice’ that would help to clarify and focus attention on the transformations in learning and leadership that were beginning to take place. These five principles were refined and developed throughout the project.\n\nThe most significant outcome of the project was a set of principles that could be used by researchers, by school leaders, by teachers and students to make the connections between leadership and learning through reflecting on, or researching, their own practice. Five statements came to represent these principles.\n\nLeadership for Learning practice involves:\n\nThese five principles are dynamically interrelated, with dialogue forming the connections, a focus on learning and shared leadership mediated by conditions for learning, and all framed by the fifth principle of accountability. ‘A focus on learning’ is quite deliberately placed first because it can be considered as the prime principle, reflecting a commitment to making learning the number one priority – the core of Leadership for Learning. \nEach headline principle is elaborated through sub-principles that amplify and illustrate.\n\nLfL is under the leadership of Professor John MacBeath and is coordinated by a management team that includes David Frost, Sue Swaffield, John Bangs, Megan Crawford, Panayiotis Antoniou, Ruth Sapsed and Caroline Jestaz.

The phenomenon is that by which a phoneme is modified in a subset of the lexicon, and spreads gradually to other lexical items. For example, in English, has changed to in \"good\" and \"hood\" but not in \"food\"; some dialects have it in \"hoof\" and/or \"roof\" but others do not; in \"flood\" and \"blood\" it happened early enough that the words were affected by the change of to , which is now no longer productive.\n\nThe related theory, proposed by William Wang in 1969, is that all sound changes originate in a single word or a small group of words and then spread to other words with a similar phonological make-up, but may not spread to all words in which they potentially could apply. The theory of lexical diffusion stands in contrast to the Neogrammarian hypothesis that a given sound change applies simultaneously to all words in which its context is found.\n\nMainstream historical linguists reject Wang's hypothesis, continuing to adhere to Neogrammarian exceptionlessness. For example, Pulleyblank regards the theoretical formulation of lexical diffusion as presented by Hsieh in Wang 1977 as \"so manifestly at odds with any realistic picture of how dialects are inter-related and how innovations spread spatially through a language as to make them totally untenable\" (1982: 408).\n\nReferring to one of Wang's touchstones of lexical diffusion, Egerod dismisses his theory as a sleight of hand:\n\nthere is no \"massive split\" involved, but an error of methodology in accounting for tones. Cháozhōu like other languages in China or outside of China has a complicated history with migration waves, loans and analogical formation. The conscientious historical linguist has to account for these before he resorts to a deus ex machina (1981: 173).\n\nMazaudon & Lowe conclude a robust critique of lexical diffusion in a similar vein, remarking that \"a detailed study of the history of the language can disentangle the reflexes from different sources, and it is not necessary to renounce the principle of regular change for the sake of such cases\" (1993: 11).\n\nWilliam Labov, in \"Principles of Linguistic Change\", takes the position that there are two types of sound changes: regular sound change (respecting the Neogrammarian hypothesis) and lexical diffusion. Labov lists a typology, according to which certain phenomena are typically or exclusively regular (example, vowel quality changes), while others (example, metathesis, or vowel shortening) tend to follow a lexical diffusion pattern.\n\nPaul Kiparsky, in the Handbook of Phonology (Goldsmith editor), argues that under a proper definition of analogy as optimization, lexical diffusion is not a type of sound change. Instead, Kiparsky claims it is similar to leveling, in that it is a non-proportional type of analogy.\n\n"}
{"id": "13502171", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13502171", "title": "Local history", "text": "Local history\n\nLocal history is the study of history in a geographically local context and it often concentrates on the local community. It incorporates cultural and social aspects of history. Local history is not merely national history writ small but a study of past events in a given geographical but one that is based on a wide variety of documentary evidence and placed in a comparative context that is both regional and national. Historic plaques are one form of documentation of significant occurrences in the past and oral histories are another. \n\nLocal history is often documented by local historical societies or groups that form to preserve a local historic building or other historic site. Many works of local history are compiled by amateur historians working independently or archivists employed by various organizations. An important aspect of local history is the publication and cataloguing of documents preserved in local or national records which relate to particular areas.\n\nIn a number of countries a broader concept of local lore is known, which is a comprehensive study of everything pertaining to a certain locality: history, ethnography, geography, natural history, etc. \n\nLocal history tends to be less documented than other types, with fewer books and artifacts than that of a country or continent. Many local histories are recorded as oral tales or stories and so are more vulnerable than more well known issues. Artifacts of local history are often collected in local history museums, which may be housed in a historic house or other building. Individual historic sites are inherently local, although they may have national or world history importance as well. Many however have little overall historical impact but add depth to the local area.\n\nIn Australia, local history is focussed on specific cities and suburbs or country towns and regions. In cities, local history might concentrate on a CBD and its bordering suburbs, on a specific suburb or municipality, or on an agglomeration of suburbs and municipalities (because local government boundaries have changed over time). Outside the larger cities, local history often examines regional towns and surrounding areas.\n\nRecords are typically stored at state libraries, municipal libraries, historical societies and public record offices. For example, the State Library of Victoria holds extensive local history records for Melbourne and other places in Victoria. Many other Melbourne libraries have local history collections, along with the Public Record Office Victoria and the Royal Historical Society of Victoria. In New South Wales, the Royal Australian Historical Society has studied local history as part of its remit since its founding in 1901. It holds local history records along with the State Library of NSW and other state and local libraries and archives.\n\nHistorians have examined the ways local history has been written in Australia since the nineteenth century. Early on, the emphasis was on pioneer and settler history. The creative ways that local history contributed to making community has also been argued. Subsequently, local history, urban history, public history and heritage were closely connected in Australia.\n\nThe British Association for Local History in the United Kingdom encourages and assists in the study of local history as an academic discipline and as a leisure activity by both individuals and groups. Most historic counties in England have record societies and archaeological and historical societies which coordinate the work of historians and other researchers concerned with that area.\n\nLocal history in the UK took a long time to be accepted as an academic discipline. In the 18th and 19th centuries, it was widely regarded as an antiquarian pursuit, suitable for country parsons. The Victoria History of the Counties of England project begun in 1899 in honour of Queen Victoria with the aim of creating an encyclopaedic history of each of the historic counties of England. The project is coordinated by the Institute of Historical Research at the University of London. The first academic post related to local history was at Reading University which appointed a research fellow in local history in 1908. There was a department of local history (but without a professor) at Leicester University from 1947. H. P. R. Finberg was the first Professor of English Local History. He was appointed by Leicester in 1964. Local history continues to be neglected as an academic subject within universities. Academic local historians are often found within a more general department of history or in continuing education.\n\nLocal history is rarely taught as a separate subject in British schools. In 1908, a Board of Education circular had urged that schools should pay attention \"to the history of the town and district\" in which they were situated. In 1952, the Ministry of Education suggested schools should use local material to illustrate national themes. Within the current National Curriculum, pupils at level 4 are expected to \"show their knowledge and understanding of local, national and international history\".\n\nThe Alan Ball Local History Awards were established in the 1980s to recognize outstanding contributions in local history publishing in the UK (both in print and in new media), and to encourage the publishing of such works by public libraries and local authorities.\n\nLocal history can become a crucial component to policy-making and serve as a marketable resource and this is demonstrated in the case of Northern Ireland. Aside from its contribution to local development, local history is being used as a non-contentious meeting ground in addressing conflicting traditions by reinforcing shared past rather than adversarial political history.\n\nIn the United States, local history is usually concentrated on any history of the place and people from a particular village or township. Several villages and townships would comprise one county or county history. Library records are often divided by State, then county, then township/local history. The American Local History Network (ALHN) in the United States provides a focus for accessing independent genealogical and historical resources.\n\nIn the United States, 79,000 historic sites are identified as listings on its National Register of Historic Places. State and local municipalities often have additional landmark designations to cover sites of more purely local interest.\n\nIn addition, many regional and state historical societies maintain regional history and actively seek out missing historical collections.\n\nA new form of local history is the movement of \"If This House Could Talk\" projects in various urban neighborhoods in the United States. These small scale locally generated history events encourage an interest in history and provide for open ended participation by the general public. However, there is often no vetting or third party review of the factual evidence that is presented, and therefore such presentations may require oversight by professional third party history organizations if they are to be transcribed into ongoing collections of local history.\n\nIn several Slavic countries there is a related study which may be translated from the local languages as \"country lore\" or \"local lore\". In addition to history, it also incorporates other local studies, such as local geography, nature, and ethnography.\n\nIn the USSR, Russia and Russian-speaking post-Soviet states local lore is known as \"krayevedenie\" (). It is taught in primary schools. There are also local lore museums known as \"krayevedcheskie muzei\". In modern Russia the concept of \"regional studies\" ( Регионоведение) is also considered.\n\nIn Ukraine, the study of local history and regional ethnography is known as \"krayeznavstvo\" (. The National Union of Local Lore Researchers of Ukraine is a professional society for researchers of ethnology and local studies in Ukraine. It was founded in 1925 and has 3,000 members in 17 chapters. The society has published its journal \"Краєзнавство\" since 1927.\n\nIn Poland, the corresponding concept is called \"\", the term known since 1902. In modern Poland various organized \"krajoznawstwo\" activities are carried out by Polskie Towarzystwo Turystyczno-Krajoznawcze, ineptly translated as \"Polish Tourist and Sightseeing Society\".\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "47643", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47643", "title": "Michel Foucault", "text": "Michel Foucault\n\nPaul-Michel Foucault (; 15 October 1926 – 25 June 1984), generally known as Michel Foucault (), was a French philosopher, historian of ideas, social theorist, and literary critic.\n\nFoucault's theories primarily address the relationship between power and knowledge , and how they are used as a form of social control through societal institutions. Though often cited as a post-structuralist and postmodernist, Foucault rejected these labels, preferring to present his thought as a critical history of modernity. His thought has influenced academics, especially those working in communication studies, sociology, cultural studies, literary theory, feminism, and critical theory. Activist groups have also found his theories compelling.\n\nBorn in Poitiers, France, into an upper-middle-class family, Foucault was educated at the Lycée Henri-IV, at the École Normale Supérieure, where he developed an interest in philosophy and came under the influence of his tutors Jean Hyppolite and Louis Althusser, and at the University of Paris (Sorbonne), where he earned degrees in philosophy and psychology. After several years as a cultural diplomat abroad, he returned to France and published his first major book, \"The History of Madness\" (1961). After obtaining work between 1960 and 1966 at the University of Clermont-Ferrand, he produced \"The Birth of the Clinic\" (1963) and \"The Order of Things\" (1966), publications which displayed his increasing involvement with structuralism, from which he later distanced himself. These first three histories exemplified a historiographical technique Foucault was developing called \"archaeology\".\n\nFrom 1966 to 1968, Foucault lectured at the University of Tunis before returning to France, where he became head of the philosophy department at the new experimental university of Paris VIII. Foucault subsequently published \"The Archaeology of Knowledge\" (1969). In 1970, Foucault was admitted to the Collège de France, a membership he retained until his death. He also became active in a number of left-wing groups involved in campaigns against racism and human rights abuses and for penal reform. Foucault later published \"Discipline and Punish\" (1975) and \"The History of Sexuality\" (1976), in which he developed archaeological and genealogical methods which emphasized the role that power plays in society.\n\nFoucault died in Paris of neurological problems compounded by HIV/AIDS; he became the first public figure in France to die from the disease. His partner Daniel Defert founded the AIDES charity in his memory.\n\nPaul-Michel Foucault was born on 15 October 1926 in the city of Poitiers, west-central France, as the second of three children in a prosperous and socially conservative upper-middle-class family.\nFamily tradition prescribed naming him after his father, Dr. Paul Foucault, but his mother insisted on the addition of \"Michel\"; referred to as \"Paul\" at school, he expressed a preference for \"Michel\" throughout his life.\n\nHis father (1893–1959), a successful local surgeon born in Fontainebleau, moved to Poitiers, where he set up his own practice and married local woman Anne Malapert. She was the daughter of prosperous surgeon Dr. Prosper Malapert, who owned a private practice and taught anatomy at the University of Poitiers' School of Medicine. Paul Foucault eventually took over his father-in-law's medical practice, while his wife took charge of their large mid-19th-century house, Le Piroir, in the village of Vendeuvre-du-Poitou. Together the couple had three children – a girl named Francine and two boys, Paul-Michel and Denys – who all shared the same fair hair and bright blue eyes. The children were raised to be nominal Roman Catholics, attending mass at the Church of Saint-Porchair, and while Michel briefly became an altar boy, none of the family were devout.\n\nIn later life, Foucault would reveal very little about his childhood. Describing himself as a \"juvenile delinquent\", he claimed his father was a \"bully\" who would sternly punish him. In 1930 Foucault began his schooling, two years early, at the local Lycée Henry-IV. Here he undertook two years of elementary education before entering the main \"lycée\", where he stayed until 1936. He then undertook his first four years of secondary education at the same establishment, excelling in French, Greek, Latin and history but doing poorly at arithmetic and mathematics. In 1939 the Second World War broke out and in 1940 Nazi Germany occupied France; Foucault's parents opposed the occupation and the Vichy regime, but did not join the Resistance. In 1940 Foucault's mother enrolled him in the Collège Saint-Stanislas, a strict Roman Catholic institution run by the Jesuits. Lonely, he described his years there as an \"ordeal\", but he excelled academically, particularly in philosophy, history and literature. In 1942 he entered his final year, the \"terminale\", where he focused on the study of philosophy, earning his \"baccalauréat\" in 1943.\n\nReturning to the local Lycée Henry-IV, he studied history and philosophy for a year, aided by a personal tutor, the philosopher Louis Girard. Rejecting his father's wishes that he become a surgeon, in 1945 Foucault went to Paris, where he enrolled in one of the country's most prestigious secondary schools, which was also known as the Lycée Henri-IV. Here he studied under the philosopher Jean Hyppolite, an existentialist and expert on the work of 19th-century German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Hyppolite had devoted himself to uniting existentialist theories with the dialectical theories of Hegel and Karl Marx. These ideas influenced Foucault, who adopted Hyppolite's conviction that philosophy must develop through a study of history.\n\nAttaining excellent results, in autumn 1946 Foucault was admitted to the elite École Normale Supérieure (ENS); to gain entry, he undertook exams and an oral interrogation by Georges Canguilhem and Pierre-Maxime Schuhl. Of the hundred students entering the ENS, Foucault was ranked fourth based on his entry results, and encountered the highly competitive nature of the institution. Like most of his classmates, he was housed in the school's communal dormitories on the Parisian Rue d'Ulm.\nHe remained largely unpopular, spending much time alone, reading voraciously. His fellow students noted his love of violence and the macabre; he decorated his bedroom with images of torture and war drawn during the Napoleonic Wars by Spanish artist Francisco Goya, and on one occasion chased a classmate with a dagger. Prone to self-harm, in 1948 Foucault allegedly undertook a suicide attempt, for which his father sent him to see the psychiatrist Jean Delay at the Sainte-Anne Hospital Center. Obsessed with the idea of self-mutilation and suicide, Foucault attempted the latter several times in ensuing years, praising suicide in later writings. The ENS's doctor examined Foucault's state of mind, suggesting that his suicidal tendencies emerged from the distress surrounding his homosexuality, because same-sex sexual activity was socially taboo in France. At the time, Foucault engaged in homosexual activity with men whom he encountered in the underground Parisian gay scene, also indulging in drug use; according to biographer James Miller, he enjoyed the thrill and sense of danger that these activities offered him.\n\nAlthough studying various subjects, Foucault's particular interest was soon drawn to philosophy, reading not only Hegel and Marx but also Immanuel Kant, Edmund Husserl and most significantly, Martin Heidegger. He began reading the publications of philosopher Gaston Bachelard, taking a particular interest in his work exploring the history of science. He graduated from the ENS with a DES (\"\", roughly equivalent to an MA) in Philosophy in 1949. His DES thesis under the direction of Hyppolite was titled \"La Constitution d'un transcendental dans La Phénoménologie de l'esprit de Hegel\" (\"The Constitution of a Historical Transcendental in Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit\").\n\nIn 1948, the philosopher Louis Althusser became a tutor at the ENS. A Marxist, he proved to be an influence both on Foucault and a number of other students, encouraging them to join the French Communist Party (\"Parti communiste français\", PCF). Foucault did so in 1950, but never became particularly active in its activities, and never adopted an orthodox Marxist viewpoint, refuting core Marxist tenets such as class struggle. He soon became dissatisfied with the bigotry that he experienced within the party's ranks; he personally faced homophobia and was appalled by the anti-semitism exhibited during the Doctors' plot in the Soviet Union. He left the Communist Party in 1953, but remained Althusser's friend and defender for the rest of his life. Although failing at the first attempt in 1950, he passed his \"agrégation\" in philosophy on the second try, in 1951. Excused from national service on medical grounds, he decided to start a doctorate at the Fondation Thiers in 1951, focusing on the philosophy of psychology, but he relinquished it after only one year in 1952.\n\nFoucault was also interested in psychology and he attended Daniel Lagache's lectures at the University of Paris, where he obtained a BA (licence) in Psychology in 1949 and a Diploma in Psychopathology (\"Diplôme de psychopathologie\") from the University's Institute of Psychology (now ) in June 1952.\n\nOver the following few years, Foucault embarked on a variety of research and teaching jobs. From 1951 to 1955, he worked as a psychology instructor at the ENS at Althusser's invitation. In Paris, he shared a flat with his brother, who was training to become a surgeon, but for three days in the week commuted to the northern town of Lille, teaching psychology at the Université de Lille from 1953 to 1954. Many of his students liked his lecturing style. Meanwhile, he continued working on his thesis, visiting the Bibliothèque Nationale every day to read the work of psychologists like Ivan Pavlov, Jean Piaget and Karl Jaspers. Undertaking research at the psychiatric institute of the Sainte-Anne Hospital, he became an unofficial intern, studying the relationship between doctor and patient and aiding experiments in the electroencephalographic laboratory. Foucault adopted many of the theories of the psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, undertaking psychoanalytical interpretation of his dreams and making friends undergo Rorschach tests.\n\nEmbracing the Parisian \"avant-garde\", Foucault entered into a romantic relationship with the serialist composer Jean Barraqué. Together, they tried to produce their greatest work, heavily used recreational drugs and engaged in sado-masochistic sexual activity. In August 1953, Foucault and Barraqué holidayed in Italy, where the philosopher immersed himself in \"Untimely Meditations\" (1873–76), a set of four essays by the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. Later describing Nietzsche's work as \"a revelation\", he felt that reading the book deeply affected him, being a watershed moment in his life. Foucault subsequently experienced another groundbreaking self-revelation when watching a Parisian performance of Samuel Beckett's new play, \"Waiting for Godot\", in 1953.\n\nInterested in literature, Foucault was an avid reader of the philosopher Maurice Blanchot's book reviews published in \"Nouvelle Revue Française\". Enamoured of Blanchot's literary style and critical theories, in later works he adopted Blanchot's technique of \"interviewing\" himself. Foucault also came across Hermann Broch's 1945 novel \"The Death of Virgil\", a work that obsessed both him and Barraqué. While the latter attempted to convert the work into an epic opera, Foucault admired Broch's text for its portrayal of death as an affirmation of life. The couple took a mutual interest in the work of such authors as the Marquis de Sade, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Franz Kafka and Jean Genet, all of whose works explored the themes of sex and violence.\n\nInterested in the work of Swiss psychologist Ludwig Binswanger, Foucault aided family friend Jacqueline Verdeaux in translating his works into French. Foucault was particularly interested in Binswanger's studies of Ellen West who, like himself, had a deep obsession with suicide, eventually killing herself. In 1954, Foucault authored an introduction to Binswanger's paper \"Dream and Existence\", in which he argued that dreams constituted \"the birth of the world\" or \"the heart laid bare\", expressing the mind's deepest desires. That same year, Foucault published his first book, \"Mental Illness and Personality\" (\"Maladie mentale et personalité\"), in which he exhibited his influence from both Marxist and Heideggerian thought, covering a wide range of subject matter from the reflex psychology of Pavlov to the classic psychoanalysis of Freud. Referencing the work of sociologists and anthropologists such as Émile Durkheim and Margaret Mead, he presented his theory that illness was culturally relative. Biographer James Miller noted that while the book exhibited \"erudition and evident intelligence\", it lacked the \"kind of fire and flair\" which Foucault exhibited in subsequent works. It was largely critically ignored, receiving only one review at the time. Foucault grew to despise it, unsuccessfully attempting to prevent its republication and translation into English.\n\nFoucault spent the next five years abroad, first in Sweden, working as cultural diplomat at the University of Uppsala, a job obtained through his acquaintance with historian of religion Georges Dumézil. At Uppsala he was appointed a Reader in French language and literature, while simultaneously working as director of the Maison de France, thus opening the possibility of a cultural-diplomatic career. Although finding it difficult to adjust to the \"Nordic gloom\" and long winters, he developed close friendships with two Frenchmen, biochemist Jean-François Miquel and physicist Jacques Papet-Lépine, and entered into romantic and sexual relationships with various men. In Uppsala, he became known for his heavy alcohol consumption and reckless driving in his new Jaguar car. In spring 1956, Barraqué broke from his relationship with Foucault, announcing that he wanted to leave the \"vertigo of madness\". In Uppsala, Foucault spent much of his spare time in the university's \"Carolina Rediviva\" library, making use of their Bibliotheca Walleriana collection of texts on the history of medicine for his ongoing research. Finishing his doctoral thesis, Foucault hoped it would be accepted by Uppsala University, but Sten Lindroth, a positivistic historian of science there, was unimpressed, asserting that it was full of speculative generalisations and was a poor work of history; he refused to allow Foucault to be awarded a doctorate at Uppsala. In part because of this rejection, Foucault left Sweden. Later, Foucault admitted that the work was a first draft with certain lack of quality.\n\nAgain at Dumézil's recognition, in October 1958 Foucault arrived in the Polish capital - Warsaw, placed in charge of the University of Warsaw's Centre Français. Foucault found life in Poland difficult due to the lack of material goods and services following the destruction of the Second World War. Witnessing the aftermath of the Polish October in which students had protested against the governing communist Polish United Workers' Party, he felt that most Poles despised their government as a puppet regime of the Soviet Union, and thought that the system ran \"badly\". Considering the university a liberal enclave, he traveled the country giving lectures; proving popular, he adopted the position of \"de facto\" cultural attaché. As in France and Sweden, homosexual activity was legal but socially frowned upon in Poland, and he undertook relationships with a number of men; one was a Polish security agent who hoped to trap Foucault in an embarrassing situation, which would therefore reflect badly on the French embassy. Wracked in diplomatic scandal, he was ordered to leave Poland for a new destination. Various positions were available in West Germany, and so Foucault relocated to the (where he was director in 1958–60), teaching the same courses he had given in Uppsala and Warsaw. Spending much time in the Reeperbahn red light district, he entered into a relationship with a transvestite.\n\nIn West Germany, Foucault completed in 1960 his primary thesis (\"thèse principale\") for his State doctorate, entitled \"Folie et déraison: Histoire de la folie à l'âge classique\" (\"Madness and Insanity: History of Madness in the Classical Age\"), a philosophical work based upon his studies into the history of medicine. The book discussed how West European society had dealt with madness, arguing that it was a social construct distinct from mental illness. Foucault traces the evolution of the concept of madness through three phases: the Renaissance, the later 17th and 18th centuries, and the modern experience. The work alludes to the work of French poet and playwright Antonin Artaud, who exerted a strong influence over Foucault's thought at the time.\n\n\"Histoire de la folie\" was an expansive work, consisting of 943 pages of text, followed by appendices and a bibliography. Foucault submitted it at the University of Paris, although the university's regulations for awarding a State doctorate required the submission of both his main thesis and a shorter complementary thesis. Obtaining a doctorate in France at the period was a multi-step process. The first step was to obtain a \"rapporteur\", or \"sponsor\" for the work: Foucault chose Georges Canguilhem. The second was to find a publisher, and as a result \"Folie et déraison\" would be published in French in May 1961 by the company Plon, whom Foucault chose over Presses Universitaires de France after being rejected by Gallimard. In 1964, a heavily abridged version was published as a mass market paperback, then translated into English for publication the following year as \"Madness and Civilization\".\n\n\"Folie et déraison\" received a mixed reception in France and in foreign journals focusing on French affairs. Although it was critically acclaimed by Maurice Blanchot, Michel Serres, Roland Barthes, Gaston Bachelard, and Fernand Braudel, it was largely ignored by the leftist press, much to Foucault's disappointment. It was notably criticised for advocating metaphysics by young philosopher Jacques Derrida in a March 1963 lecture at the University of Paris. Responding with a vicious retort, Foucault criticised Derrida's interpretation of René Descartes. The two remained bitter rivals until reconciling in 1981. In the English-speaking world, the work became a significant influence on the anti-psychiatry movement during the 1960s; Foucault took a mixed approach to this, associating with a number of anti-psychiatrists but arguing that most of them misunderstood his work.\n\nFoucault's secondary thesis (his \"thèse complémentaire\" written in Hamburg between 1959 and 1960) was a translation and commentary on German philosopher Immanuel Kant's 1798 work \"Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View\" (the title of his thesis was \"Introduction à l\"Anthropologie\"\", \"Introduction to Kant's \"Anthropology\"\"). Largely consisting of Foucault's discussion of textual dating—an \"archaeology of the Kantian text\"—he rounded off the thesis with an evocation of Nietzsche, his biggest philosophical influence. This work's \"rapporteur\" was his old tutor and then director of the ENS, Hyppolite, who was well acquainted with German philosophy. After both theses were championed and reviewed, he underwent his public defense, the \"soutenance de thèse\", on 20 May 1961. The academics responsible for reviewing his work were concerned about the unconventional nature of his major thesis; reviewer Henri Gouhier noted that it was not a conventional work of history, making sweeping generalisations without sufficient particular argument, and that Foucault clearly \"thinks in allegories\". They all agreed however that the overall project was of merit, awarding Foucault his doctorate \"despite reservations\".\n\nIn October 1960, Foucault took a tenured post in philosophy at the University of Clermont-Ferrand, commuting to the city every week from Paris, where he lived in a high-rise block on the rue du Dr Finlay. Responsible for teaching psychology, which was subsumed within the philosophy department, he was considered a \"fascinating\" but \"rather traditional\" teacher at Clermont. The department was run by Jules Vuillemin, who soon developed a friendship with Foucault. Foucault then took Vuillemin's job when the latter was elected to the Collège de France in 1962. In this position, Foucault took a dislike to another staff member whom he considered stupid: Roger Garaudy, a senior figure in the Communist Party. Foucault made life at the university difficult for Garaudy, leading the latter to transfer to Poitiers. Foucault also caused controversy by securing a university job for his lover, the philosopher Daniel Defert, with whom he retained a non-monogamous relationship for the rest of his life.\n\nFoucault maintained a keen interest in literature, publishing reviews in amongst others the literary journals \"Tel Quel\" and \"Nouvelle Revue Française\", and sitting on the editorial board of \"Critique\". In May 1963, he published a book devoted to poet, novelist, and playwright Raymond Roussel. It was written in under two months, published by Gallimard, and would be described by biographer David Macey as \"a very personal book\" that resulted from a \"love affair\" with Roussel's work. It would be published in English in 1983 as \"Death and the Labyrinth: The World of Raymond Roussel\". Receiving few reviews, it was largely ignored. That same year he published a sequel to \" Folie et déraison\", entitled \"Naissance de la Clinique\", subsequently translated as \"The Birth of the Clinic: An Archaeology of Medical Perception\". Shorter than its predecessor, it focused on the changes that the medical establishment underwent in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Like his preceding work, \"Naissance de la Clinique\" was largely critically ignored, but later gained a cult following. It was of interest within the field of medical ethics, as it considered the ways in which the history of medicine and hospitals, and the training that those working within them receive, bring about a particular way of looking at the body - the 'medical gaze'. Foucault was also selected to be among the \"Eighteen Man Commission\" that assembled between November 1963 and March 1964 to discuss university reforms that were to be implemented by Christian Fouchet, the Gaullist Minister of National Education. Implemented in 1967, they brought staff strikes and student protests.\n\nIn April 1966, Gallimard published Foucault's \"Les Mots et les choses\" (\"Words and Things\"), later translated as \"The Order of Things: An Archaeology of the Human Sciences\". Exploring how man came to be an object of knowledge, it argued that all periods of history have possessed certain underlying conditions of truth that constituted what was acceptable as scientific discourse. Foucault argues that these conditions of discourse have changed over time, from one period's episteme to another. Although designed for a specialist audience, the work gained media attention, becoming a surprise bestseller in France. Appearing at the height of interest in structuralism, Foucault was quickly grouped with scholars Jacques Lacan, Claude Lévi-Strauss, and Roland Barthes, as the latest wave of thinkers set to topple the existentialism popularized by Jean-Paul Sartre. Although initially accepting this description, Foucault soon vehemently rejected it. Foucault and Sartre regularly criticised one another in the press. Both Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir attacked Foucault's ideas as \"bourgeois\", while Foucault retaliated against their Marxist beliefs by proclaiming that \"Marxism exists in nineteenth-century thought as a fish exists in water; that is, it ceases to breathe anywhere else.\"\n\nIn September 1966, Foucault took a position teaching psychology at the University of Tunis in Tunisia. His decision to do so was largely because his lover, Defert, had been posted to the country as part of his national service. Foucault moved a few kilometres from Tunis, to the village of Sidi Bou Saïd, where fellow academic Gérard Deledalle lived with his wife. Soon after his arrival, Foucault announced that Tunisia was \"blessed by history\", a nation which \"deserves to live forever because it was where Hannibal and St. Augustine lived.\" His lectures at the university proved very popular, and were well attended. Although many young students were enthusiastic about his teaching, they were critical of what they believed to be his right-wing political views, viewing him as a \"representative of Gaullist technocracy\", even though he considered himself a leftist.\n\nFoucault was in Tunis during the anti-government and pro-Palestinian riots that rocked the city in June 1967, and which continued for a year. Although highly critical of the violent, ultra-nationalistic and anti-semitic nature of many protesters, he used his status to try to prevent some of his militant leftist students from being arrested and tortured for their role in the agitation. He hid their printing press in his garden, and tried to testify on their behalf at their trials, but was prevented when the trials became closed-door events. While in Tunis, Foucault continued to write. Inspired by a correspondence with the surrealist artist René Magritte, Foucault started to write a book about the impressionist artist Édouard Manet, but never completed it.\n\nIn 1968, Foucault returned to Paris, moving into an apartment on the Rue de Vaugirard. After the May 1968 student protests, Minister of Education Edgar Faure responded by founding new universities with greater autonomy. Most prominent of these was the Centre Expérimental de Vincennes in Vincennes on the outskirts of Paris. A group of prominent academics were asked to select teachers to run the Centre's departments, and Canguilheim recommended Foucault as head of the Philosophy Department. Becoming a tenured professor of Vincennes, Foucault's desire was to obtain \"the best in French philosophy today\" for his department, employing Michel Serres, Judith Miller, Alain Badiou, Jacques Rancière, François Regnault, Henri Weber, Étienne Balibar, and François Châtelet; most of them were Marxists or ultra-left activists.\n\nLectures began at the university in January 1969, and straight away its students and staff, including Foucault, were involved in occupations and clashes with police, resulting in arrests. In February, Foucault gave a speech denouncing police provocation to protesters at the Latin Quarter of the Mutualité. Such actions marked Foucault's embrace of the ultra-left, undoubtedly influenced by Defert, who had gained a job at Vincennes' sociology department and who had become a Maoist. Most of the courses at Foucault's philosophy department were Marxist-Leninist oriented, although Foucault himself gave courses on Nietzsche, \"The end of Metaphysics\", and \"The Discourse of Sexuality\", which were highly popular and over-subscribed. While the right-wing press was heavily critical of this new institution, new Minister of Education Olivier Guichard was angered by its ideological bent and the lack of exams, with students being awarded degrees in a haphazard manner. He refused national accreditation of the department's degrees, resulting in a public rebuttal from Foucault.\n\nFoucault desired to leave Vincennes and become a fellow of the prestigious Collège de France. He requested to join, taking up a chair in what he called the \"history of systems of thought,\" and his request was championed by members Dumézil, Hyppolite, and Vuillemin. In November 1969, when an opening became available, Foucault was elected to the Collège, though with opposition by a large minority. He gave his inaugural lecture in December 1970, which was subsequently published as \"L'Ordre du discours\" (\"The Discourse of Language\"). He was obliged to give 12 weekly lectures a year—and did so for the rest of his life—covering the topics that he was researching at the time; these became \"one of the events of Parisian intellectual life\" and were repeatedly packed out events. On Mondays, he also gave seminars to a group of students; many of them became a \"Foulcauldian tribe\" who worked with him on his research. He enjoyed this teamwork and collective research, and together they would publish a number of short books. Working at the Collège allowed him to travel widely, giving lectures in Brazil, Japan, Canada, and the United States over the next 14 years. In 1970 and 1972, Foucault served as a professor in the French Department of the University at Buffalo in Buffalo, New York.\n\nIn May 1971, Foucault co-founded the Groupe d'Information sur les Prisons (GIP) along with historian Pierre Vidal-Naquet and journalist Jean-Marie Domenach. The GIP aimed to investigate and expose poor conditions in prisons and give prisoners and ex-prisoners a voice in French society. It was highly critical of the penal system, believing that it converted petty criminals into hardened delinquents. The GIP gave press conferences and staged protests surrounding the events of the Toul prison riot in December 1971, alongside other prison riots that it sparked off; in doing so it faced a police crackdown and repeated arrests. The group became active across France, with 2,000 to 3,000, members, but disbanded before 1974. Also campaigning against the death penalty, Foucault co-authored a short book on the case of the executed murderer Pierre Rivière. After his research into the penal system, Foucault published \"Surveiller et punir: Naissance de la prison\" (\"Discipline and Punish\") in 1975, offering a history of the system in western Europe. In it, Foucault examines the penal evolution away from corporal and capital punishment to the penitentiary system that began in Europe and the United States around the end of the 18th century. Biographer Didier Eribon described it as \"perhaps the finest\" of Foucault's works, and it was well received.\n\nFoucault was also active in anti-racist campaigns; in November 1971, he was a leading figure in protests following the perceived racist killing of Arab migrant Dejellali Ben Ali. In this he worked alongside his old rival Sartre, the journalist Claude Mauriac, and one of his literary heroes, Jean Genet. This campaign was formalised as the Committee for the Defence of the Rights of Immigrants, but there was tension at their meetings as Foucault opposed the anti-Israeli sentiment of many Arab workers and Maoist activists. At a December 1972 protest against the police killing of Algerian worker Mohammad Diab, both Foucault and Genet were arrested, resulting in widespread publicity. Foucault was also involved in founding the Agence de Press-Libération (APL), a group of leftist journalists who intended to cover news stories neglected by the mainstream press. In 1973, they established the daily newspaper \"Libération\", and Foucault suggested that they establish committees across France to collect news and distribute the paper, and advocated a column known as the \"Chronicle of the Workers' Memory\" to allow workers' to express their opinions. Foucault wanted an active journalistic role in the paper, but this proved untenable, and he soon became disillusioned with \"Libération\", believing that it distorted the facts; he would not publish in it until 1980.\n\nIn 1976, Gallimard published Foucault's \"Histoire de la sexualité: la volonté de savoir\" (\"The History of Sexuality: The Will to Knowledge\"), a short book exploring what Foucault called the \"repressive hypothesis\". It revolved largely around the concept of power, rejecting both Marxist and Freudian theory. Foucault intended it as the first in a seven-volume exploration of the subject. \"Histoire de la sexualité\" was a best-seller in France and gained positive press, but lukewarm intellectual interest, something that upset Foucault, who felt that many misunderstood his hypothesis. He soon became dissatisfied with Gallimard after being offended by senior staff member Pierre Nora. Along with Paul Veyne and François Wahl, Foucault launched a new series of academic books, known as \"Des travaux\" (\"Some Works\"), through the company Seuil, which he hoped would improve the state of academic research in France. He also produced introductions for the memoirs of Herculine Barbin and \"My Secret Life\".\n\nFoucault remained a political activist, focusing on protesting government abuses of human rights around the world. He was a key player in the 1975 protests against the Spanish government to execute 11 militants sentenced to death without fair trial. It was his idea to travel to Madrid with 6 others to give their press conference there; they were subsequently arrested and deported back to Paris. In 1977, he protested the extradition of Klaus Croissant to West Germany, and his rib was fractured during clashes with riot police. In July that year, he organised an assembly of Eastern Bloc dissidents to mark the visit of Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev to Paris. In 1979, he campaigned for Vietnamese political dissidents to be granted asylum in France.\n\nIn 1977, Italian newspaper \"Corriere della sera\" asked Foucault to write a column for them. In doing so, in 1978 he travelled to Tehran in Iran, days after the Black Friday massacre. Documenting the developing Iranian Revolution, he met with opposition leaders such as Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari and Mehdi Bazargan, and discovered the popular support for Islamism. Returning to France, he was one of the journalists who visited the Ayatollah Khomeini, before visiting Tehran. His articles expressed awe of Khomeini's Islamist movement, for which he was widely criticised in the French press, including by Iranian expatriates. Foucault's response was that Islamism was to become a major political force in the region, and that the West must treat it with respect rather than hostility. In April 1978, Foucault traveled to Japan, where he studied Zen Buddhism under Omori Sogen at the Seionji temple in Uenohara.\n\nAlthough remaining critical of power relations, Foucault expressed cautious support for the Socialist Party government of François Mitterrand following its electoral victory in 1981. But his support soon deteriorated when that party refused to condemn the Polish government's crackdown on the 1982 demonstrations in Poland orchestrated by the Solidarity trade union. He and sociologist Pierre Bourdieu authored a document condemning Mitterrand's inaction that was published in \"Libération\", and they also took part in large public protests on the issue. Foucault continued to support Solidarity, and with his friend Simone Signoret traveled to Poland as part of a Médecins du Monde expedition, taking time out to visit the Auschwitz concentration camp. He continued his academic research, and in June 1984 Gallimard published the second and third volumes of \"Histoire de la sexualité\". Volume two, \"L'Usage des plaisirs\", dealt with the \"techniques of self\" prescribed by ancient Greek pagan morality in relation to sexual ethics, while volume three, \"Le Souci de soi\", explored the same theme in the Greek and Latin texts of the first two centuries CE. A fourth volume, \"Les Aveux de la chair\", was to examine sexuality in early Christianity, but it was not finished.\n\nIn October 1980, Foucault became a visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley, giving the Howison Lectures on \"Truth and Subjectivity\", while in November he lectured at the Humanities Institute at New York University. His growing popularity in American intellectual circles was noted by \"Time\" magazine, while Foucault went on to lecture at UCLA in 1981, the University of Vermont in 1982, and Berkeley again in 1983, where his lectures drew huge crowds. Foucault spent many evenings in the San Francisco gay scene, frequenting sado-masochistic bathhouses, engaging in unprotected sex. He would praise sado-masochistic activity in interviews with the gay press, describing it as \"the real creation of new possibilities of pleasure, which people had no idea about previously.\" Foucault contracted HIV and eventually developed AIDS. Little was known of the virus at the time; the first cases had only been identified in 1980. In summer 1983, he developed a persistent dry cough, which concerned friends in Paris, but Foucault insisted it was just a pulmonary infection. Only when hospitalized was Foucault correctly diagnosed; treated with antibiotics, he delivered a final set of lectures at the Collège de France. Foucault entered Paris' Hôpital de la Salpêtrière—the same institution that he had studied in \"Madness and Civilisation\"—on 10 June 1984, with neurological symptoms complicated by septicemia. He died in the hospital on 25 June.\n\nOn 26 June, \"Libération\" announced his death, mentioning the rumour that it had been brought on by AIDS. The following day, \"Le Monde\" issued a medical bulletin cleared by his family which made no reference to HIV/AIDS. On 29 June, Foucault's \"la levée du corps\" ceremony was held, in which the coffin was carried from the hospital morgue. Hundreds attended, including activist and academic friends, while Gilles Deleuze gave a speech using excerpts from \"The History of Sexuality\". His body was then buried at Vendeuvre in a small ceremony. Soon after his death, Foucault's partner Daniel Defert founded the first national HIV/AIDS organisation in France, AIDES; a pun on the French language word for \"help\" (\"aide\") and the English language acronym for the disease. On the second anniversary of Foucault's death, Defert publicly revealed that Foucault's death was AIDS-related in \"The Advocate\".\n\nFoucault's first biographer, Didier Eribon, described the philosopher as \"a complex, many-sided character\", and that \"under one mask there is always another\". He also noted that he exhibited an \"enormous capacity for work\". At the ENS, Foucault's classmates unanimously summed him up as a figure who was both \"disconcerting and strange\" and \"a passionate worker\". As he aged, his personality changed: Eribon noted that while he was a \"tortured adolescent\", post-1960, he had become \"a radiant man, relaxed and cheerful\", even being described by those who worked with him as a dandy. He noted that in 1969, Foucault embodied the idea of \"the militant intellectual\".\n\nFoucault was an atheist. He was also a fan of classical music, particularly enjoying the work of Johann Sebastian Bach and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and became known for wearing turtleneck jumpers. After his death, Foucault's friend Georges Dumézil described him as having possessed \"a profound kindness and goodness\", also exhibiting an \"intelligence [that] literally knew no bounds.\" His life-partner Daniel Defert inherited his estate.\n\nFoucault's colleague Pierre Bourdieu summarised the philosopher's thought as \"a long exploration of transgression, of going beyond social limits, always inseparably linked to knowledge and power.\"\n\nPhilosopher Philip Stokes of the University of Reading noted that overall, Foucault's work was \"dark and pessimistic\", but that it did leave some room for optimism, in that it illustrates how the discipline of philosophy can be used to highlight areas of domination. In doing so, Stokes claimed, we are able to understand how we are being dominated and strive to build social structures that minimise this risk of domination. In all of this development there had to be close attention to detail; it is the detail which eventually individualises people.\n\nLater in his life, Foucault explained that his work was less about analysing power as a phenomenon than about trying to characterise the different ways in which contemporary society has expressed the use of power to \"objectivise subjects.\" These have taken three broad forms: one involving scientific authority to classify and 'order' knowledge about human populations. A second, and related form, has been to categorise and 'normalise' human subjects (by identifying madness, illness, physical features, and so on). The third relates to the manner in which the impulse to fashion sexual identities and train one's own body to engage in routines and practices ends up reproducing certain patterns within a given society.\n\nPolitically, Foucault was a leftist through much of his life, but his particular stance within the left often changed. Towards the end, as he suffered from AIDS, he adopted classical liberalism and had a strong interest in Stoic philosophy. In the early 1950s he had been a member of the French Communist Party, although he never adopted an orthodox Marxist viewpoint and left the party after three years, disgusted by the prejudice against Jews and homosexuals within its ranks. After spending some time working in Poland, then governed as a socialist state by the Polish United Workers' Party, he became further disillusioned with communist ideology. As a result, in the early 1960s he was considered to be \"violently anticommunist\" by some of his detractors, even though he was involved in leftist campaigns along with most of his students and colleagues.\n\nIn addition to his philosophical work, Foucault also wrote on literature. \"Death and the Labyrinth: The World of Raymond Roussel\" was published in 1963, and translated into English in 1986. It is Foucault's only book-length work on literature. Foucault described it as \"by far the book I wrote most easily, with the greatest pleasure, and most rapidly.\" Foucault explores theory, criticism, and psychology with reference to the texts of Raymond Roussel, one of the first notable experimental writers.\n\nFoucault's discussions on power and discourse have inspired many critical theorists, who believe that Foucault's analysis of power structures could aid the struggle against inequality. They claim that through discourse analysis, hierarchies may be uncovered and questioned by way of analyzing the corresponding fields of knowledge through which they are legitimated. This is one of the ways that Foucault's work is linked to critical theory. His discussion on power and discourse also influences the postcolonial critique in explaining the discursive formation of colonialism Foucault's work has been compared to that of Erving Goffman by the sociologist Michael Hviid Jacobsen and Soren Kristiansen, who list Goffman as an influence on Foucault.\n\nIn 2007, Foucault was listed as the most cited scholar in the humanities by the \"ISI Web of Science\" among a large quantity of French philosophers, the compilation's author commenting that \"What this says of modern scholarship is for the reader to decide—and it is imagined that judgments will vary from admiration to despair, depending on one's view\".\n\nA prominent critique of Foucault's thought concerns his refusal to propose positive solutions to the social and political issues that he critiques. Since no human relation is devoid of power, freedom becomes elusive—even as an ideal. This stance which critiques normativity as socially constructed and contingent, but which relies on an implicit norm in order to mount the critique led philosopher Jürgen Habermas to describe Foucault's thinking as \"crypto-normativist\", covertly reliant on the very Enlightenment principles he attempts to argue against. A similar critique has been advanced by Diana Taylor, and by Nancy Fraser who argues that \"Foucault's critique encompasses traditional moral systems, he denies himself recourse to concepts such as 'freedom' and 'justice', and therefore lacks the ability to generate positive alternatives.\" Likewise, scholar Nancy Pearcey points out Foucault's paradoxical stance: \"[when someone] states that it is impossible to attain objectivity, is that an objective statement? The theory undercuts its own claims.\"\n\nThe philosopher Richard Rorty has argued that Foucault's 'archaeology of knowledge' is fundamentally negative, and thus fails to adequately establish any 'new' theory of knowledge \"per se\". Rather, Foucault simply provides a few valuable maxims regarding the reading of history. Rorty writes:\n\nFoucault has frequently been criticized by historians for what they consider to be a lack of rigor in his analyses. For example, Hans-Ulrich Wehler harshly criticized Foucault in 1998. Wehler regards Foucault as a bad philosopher who wrongfully received a good response by the humanities and by social sciences. According to Wehler, Foucault's works are not only insufficient in their empiric historical aspects, but also often contradictory and lacking in clarity. For example, Foucault's concept of power is \"desperatingly undifferentiated\", and Foucault's thesis of a \"disciplinary society\" is, according to Wehler, only possible because Foucault does not properly differentiate between authority, force, power, violence and legitimacy. In addition, his thesis is based on a one-sided choice of sources (prisons and psychiatric institutions) and neglects other types of organizations as e.g. factories. Also, Wehler criticizes Foucault's \"francocentrism\" because he did not take into consideration major German-speaking theorists of social sciences like Max Weber and Norbert Elias. In all, Wehler concludes that Foucault is \"because of the endless series of flaws in his so-called empirical studies ... an intellectually dishonest, empirically absolutely unreliable, crypto-normativist seducer of Postmodernism\".\n\nThough American feminists have built on Foucault's critiques of the historical construction of gender roles and sexuality, some feminists note the limitations of the masculinist subjectivity and ethical orientation that he describes.\n\nThe philosopher Roger Scruton argues in \"Sexual Desire\" (1986) that Foucault was incorrect to claim, in \"The History of Sexuality\", that sexual morality is culturally relative. He criticizes Foucault for assuming that there could be societies in which a \"problematisation\" of the sexual did not occur, concluding that, \"No history of thought could show the 'problematisation' of sexual experience to be peculiar to certain specific social formations: it is characteristic of personal experience generally, and therefore of every genuine social order.\"\n\nFoucault's approach to sexuality, which he sees as socially constructed, has become influential in queer theory. Foucault's resistance to identity politics, and his rejection of the psychoanalytic concept of object choice, stands at odds with some theories of queer identity.\n\nFoucault is sometimes criticized for his prominent formulation of principles of social constructionism, which some see as an affront to the concept of truth. In Foucault's 1971 televised debate with Noam Chomsky, Foucault argued against the possibility of any fixed human nature, as posited by Chomsky's concept of innate human faculties. Chomsky argued that concepts of justice were rooted in human reason, whereas Foucault rejected the universal basis for a concept of justice. Following the debate, Chomsky was stricken with Foucault's total rejection of the possibility of a universal morality, stating \"He struck me as completely amoral, I'd never met anyone who was so totally amoral [...] I mean, I liked him personally, it's just that I couldn't make sense of him. It's as if he was from a different species, or something.\"\n\nPeruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa, while acknowledging that Foucault contributed to give a right of citizenship in cultural life to certain marginal and eccentric experiences (of sexuality, of cultural repression, of madness), asserts that his radical critique of authority was detrimental to education. Foucault's notion of observation, and its power to change individuals' behavior as a subtle type of authority, influences many fields of education.\n\n\nGeneral sites (updated regularly):\n\nBiographies:\n\nBibliographies:\n\nJournals:\n"}

This field encompasses multidisciplinary participation between design, psychology, computer science, and religion. Mindfulness stems from Buddhist meditation practices and refers to the awareness that arises through paying attention on purpose in the present moment, and non-judgmentally. In the field of Human-Computer Interaction, research is being done on \"Techno-spirituality\" — the study of how technology can facilitate feelings of awe, wonder, transcendence, and mindfulness and on \"Slow design\", which facilitates self-reflection. The excessive use of personal devices, such as smartphones and laptops, can lead to the deterioration of mental and physical health. This area focuses on redesigning and creating technology to improve the wellbeing of its users.\n\nIn 1979, Jon Kabat-Zinn founded the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program at the University of Massachusetts to treat the chronically ill. He is noted to be responsible for the popularization of mindfulness in Western culture. The program uses combination of mindfulness meditation, body awareness, and yoga. These practices were derived from teachings of the Eastern World, specifically Buddhist traditions. Researchers found that enhanced mindfulness through the program mediated the association between increased daily spiritual experiences and improved mental health-related quality of life.\n\nThere are applications for desktop and mobile to help users bring themselves back to the present moment.\n\nAccording to Vietnamese Zen teacher Thich Nhat Hanh, the ringing of a bell every 15 minutes is an effective way to cultivate the mindfulness practice and connect back with the body. The Mindfulness Bell and Mindful Mynah applications simulate the bell on the user's personal device.\n\nA 2011 brain imaging study published in the \"Journal of Neuroscience\" found that even very brief instruction in mindfulness meditation (four 20-minute sessions) was effective in relieving pain by reducing the brain's emotional response to painful stimuli. To help make meditation and mindfulness more accessible, developers have created digital health platforms, such as Headspace, Insight Timer and Buddhify.\n\nThere are several wearables which measures the breath in order to connect the user back to their body. Wo.Defy is a dress which attempts to reveal the beauty of emotional communication using the common platform of the human breath; proposing the best methods of human to human communication lie within us. Spire measures your breathing patterns to give you insights into your state of mind. Being, the mindfulness tracker from Zensorium, maps user’s emotions (stressed, excited normal and calm) through heart rate variability. WellBe monitors heart rate levels and then matches them, through a patent pending algorithm, to specific moments and interactions throughout a user’s day.

By providing real-time visual and sonic feedback, VMW enables patients to learn how to manage their pain.\n\nIntel anthropologist Genevieve Bell has urged the human-computer interaction (HCI) research community to devote more research to the use of technology in spirituality and religion. Techno-spirituality is the study of how technology can facilitate feelings of awe, wonder, transcendence, and mindfulness. Currently, there are 6,000 applications related to spirituality and religion. This area is in high demand and “important under-explored areas of HCI research”.\n\nInspired by Bell’s work, researchers (Sterling & Zimmerman) focused on how mobile phones could be incorporated in American Soto Zen Buddhist community, without conflicting with their philosophy of “the here and the now”. They were able to find three ways to use technology to help strengthen ties within the community.\n\nSlow design is a design agenda for technology aimed at reflection and moments of mental rest rather than efficiency in performance.\n\nMindful design, based on Langer’s theory of mindfulness, is a design philosophy that incorporates the idea of mindfulness into creating meaningful user oriented design. A major tenant is the behavior change of a user through awareness and responsibility of meaningful interactions between user and designed object, and this will encourage more desirable human practices. This type of mind behavior driven change has been most heavily incorporated design for sustainability. Other approaches include crime prevention or health. It is also seen in the design of safety objects and the social interaction of performative objects.\n\nPerformative objects are identified as design objects that are designed to facilitate mindful awareness of the physical and symbolic social actions and their consequences within which they are used.\n\nClasses in mindfulness practices have become part of some of Silicon Valleys major tech giants. Google has implemented a series of bimonthly \"mindfulness lunches\" as well as built a labyrinth for walking meditations. Both Twitter and Facebook have incorporated contemplative practices into their corporate culture. The desired outcome of using mindfulness in the tech workforce is to increase communication and develop the emotional intelligence of their employees.\n\nMindfulness is currently being explored by researchers as a possible treatment for technological addiction, also known as Internet addiction disorder, a form of behavioral addiction. There has been some consensus in the field of psychology on the benefits of using mindfulness to treat behavioral addiction.\nExperts in the field say in order to treat technology addiction with mindfulness, one must be non-judgmental about the behavior and pay attention in order to recognize instances in which technology is being used mindlessly. Then reflect on the helpfulness of the device, and notice the benefits of disconnecting. The three keystones of mindfulness are: Intention, Attention and Action. Technology is said to interfere with mindfulness by causing the individual to forget what matters (intention), the distracts (attention), and then keeps the individual from taking action.\n\nIn technological addiction, the reward system, located in the mid-brain and underlies addiction, evolved to rewards finding and consuming food. In complex animals this evolution also rewards the exchange of information within the social group. In humans this has developed into its current form of mass worldwide communication. The exchange of social information has demonstrated reward based reinforcement, similar to that of gamification.\n\nCritics of the mindfulness movement in technology focus on several key areas, technophobia, pacifications of genuine grievances in the workforce and disconnection from religious roots. The editor of the New Republic, Eygeny Morozov, questions the value of tech companies who advocate \"unplugging\" from the modern digital lifestyle as similar to a drug addict taking a tolerance break from the substance they are addicted to in order to then increase the vigor with which those activities are then resumed (3, 4). They also state that the concept of Mindfulness in the tech world is jargonistic and amorphous.\n\nMobile meditation applications like Calm and Headspace have over a million users and are increasing in popularity. Swedish Researchers found that downloading and using the applications for eight weeks made little to no difference for people with major depression and anxiety. They did, however, see improvements with a subgroup with mild levels of depression.\n\nCriticisms of the slow technology movement are similar to the slow-food movement; it lacks understanding of global scope, and as an individualistic response will not answer the actual problems in technology. This movement has been dubbed by critics as disconnectionists. Mindfulness in technology and has been criticized as being less about restoring self and more about stifling autonomy that technology inspires. Anti-disconnectionists state mindfulness and the expressed need to disconnect from technology and the modern world can be accused of being a nostalgia-manipulating marketing tactic and maybe a technological form of conservatism. Critics state that the labeling of digital connection as debasing and unnatural is in direct proportion to the rapidity of adoption. Thus it is depicted as a dangerous desire and toxin to be regulated. This argument itself can be tied back to rationalization, Walter Benjamin on aura, Jacques Ellul on technique, Jean Baudrillard on simulations, or Zygmunt Bauman and the Frankfurt School on modernity and the Enlightenment. Critics state that disconnectionists see the Internet as having normalized or enforced a repression of an authentic self in favor of a social media avatar. Thus reflecting the desire to connect with a deeper self, which may itself be an illusion. The pathologization of technology use then opens the door for Foucault's idea of \"normalization\" to be applied to technology in similar fashion as other social ills, which then can become a concept around which social control and management can be applied.\n\nThere is some concern among Buddhist practitioners that decoupling mediation and mindfulness from the core tenement of Buddhism may have negative effects. The wide adoption of mindfulness in technology and the tech industry has been accused of increasing passivity in the worker by creating a calm mindstate which then allows for disconnect form actual grievances. Critics of mindfulness in Cognitive Behavior Therapy also comment on this as a possible problem. However, critics of the movement fear that the secularization of mindfulness, dubbed McMindfulness, leads to reinforcement of anti-Buddhist ideas. Buddhists differentiate between Right Mindfulness (samma sati) and Wrong Mindfulness (miccha sati). The distinction is not moralistic: the issue is whether the quality of awareness is characterized by wholesome intentions and positive mental qualities that lead to human flourishing and optimal well-being for others as well as oneself. Mindfulness as adopted by the Silicon Valley Tech giants has been criticized as conveniently shifting the burden of stress and toxic work environment onto the individual employee. Obfuscated by the seemingly inherent qualities of care and humanity, mindfulness is refashioned into a way to coping with and adapting to the stresses and strains of corporate life rather than actually solve them.\n"}

S. Lewis, published by Geoffrey Bles in 1951. It was the second published of seven novels in \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" (1950–1956), and Lewis had finished writing it in 1949, before the first book was out. It is volume four in recent editions of the series, sequenced according to Narnia history. Like the others, it was illustrated by Pauline Baynes and her work has been retained in many later editions.\n\n\"Prince Caspian\" features \"return to Narnia\" by the four Pevensie children of the first novel, about a year later in England but 1300 years later in Narnia. It is the only book of \"The Chronicles\" with men dominating Narnia. The talking animals and mythical beings are oppressed, and some may be endangered. The English siblings are legendary and are magically recalled once again as children by the refugee Prince Caspian.\n\nMacmillan US published an American edition within the calendar year.\n\n\"Prince Caspian\" has been adapted and filmed as two episodes of BBC television series in 1989 and as a feature film in 2008.\n\nWhile standing on a British railway station, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie are magically whisked away to a beach near an old and ruined castle. They determine the ruin is Cair Paravel, where they ruled as the Kings and Queens of Narnia, and discover the treasure vault where Peter's sword and shield, Susan's bow and arrows, and Lucy's bottle of magical cordial and dagger are stored. Susan's horn for summoning help is missing, as she left it in the woods the day they returned to England after their prior visit to Narnia. Although only a year has passed in England, 1300 years have passed in Narnia.\n\nThe children intervene to rescue Trumpkin the dwarf from soldiers who have brought him to the ruins to drown him. Trumpkin tells the children that since their disappearance, a race of men called Telmarines have invaded Narnia, driving the Talking Beasts into the wilderness and pushing even their memory underground. Narnia is ruled by King Miraz and his wife Queen Prunaprismia, but the rightful king is Miraz's nephew, Prince Caspian, who has gained the support of the Old Narnians.\n\nMiraz usurped the throne by killing his brother, Caspian's father King Caspian IX. Miraz tolerated Caspian as heir until his own son was born. Prince Caspian, until that point ignorant of his uncle's deeds, escaped from Miraz's Castle with the aid of his tutor Doctor Cornelius, who schooled him in the lore of Old Narnia, and gave him Queen Susan's horn. Caspian fled into the forest but was knocked unconscious when his horse bolted. He awoke in the den of a Talking Badger, Trufflehunter, and two dwarfs, Nikabrik and Trumpkin, who accepted Caspian as their king.\n\nThe badger and dwarves took Caspian to meet many creatures of Old Narnia. During a midnight council on Dancing Lawn, Doctor Cornelius arrived to warn them of the approach of King Miraz and his army; he urged them to flee to Aslan's How in the great woods near Cair Paravel. The Telmarines followed the Narnians to the How, and after several skirmishes the Narnians appeared close to defeat. At a second war council, they discussed whether to use Queen Susan's horn, and whether it would bring Aslan or the Kings and Queens of the golden age. Not knowing where help would arrive, they dispatched a squirrel to Lantern Waste and Trumpkin to Cair Paravel; it is then that Trumpkin was captured by the Telmarines and rescued by the Pevensies.\n\nTrumpkin and the Pevensies make their way to Caspian. They try to save time by travelling up Glasswater Creek, but lose their way. Lucy sees Aslan and wants to follow where he leads, but the others do not believe her and follow their original course, which becomes increasingly difficult. In the night, Aslan calls Lucy and tells her she must awaken the others and insist they follow her on Aslan's path. When the others obey, they begin to see Aslan's shadow, then Aslan himself. Aslan sends Peter, Edmund, and Trumpkin ahead to Aslan's How to deal with treachery brewing there, and follows with Susan and Lucy.\n\nPeter, Edmund, and Trumpkin enter Aslan's How; they overhear Nikabrik and his confederates, a Hag and a Wer-Wolf, trying to persuade Caspian, Cornelius, and Trufflehunter to help them resurrect the White Witch in hopes of using her power to defeat Miraz. A fight ensues, and Nikabrik and his comrades are slain.\n\nPeter challenges Miraz to single combat; the army of the victor in this duel will be considered the victor in the war. Miraz accepts the challenge, goaded by Lords Glozelle and Sopespian. Miraz loses the combat, but Glozelle and Sopespian declare that the Narnians have cheated and stabbed the King in the back while he was down. They command the Telmarine army to attack, and in the commotion that follows, Glozelle stabs Miraz in the back. Aslan, accompanied by Lucy and Susan, summons the gods Bacchus and Silenus, and with their help brings the woods to life. The gods and awakened trees turn the tide of battle and send the Telmarines fleeing. Discovering themselves trapped at the Great River, where their bridge has been destroyed by Bacchus, the Telmarines surrender.\n\nAslan gives the Telmarines a choice of staying in Narnia under Caspian or returning to Earth, their original home. After one volunteer disappears through the magic door created by Aslan, the Pevensies go through to reassure the other Telmarines, though Peter and Susan reveal to Edmund and Lucy that they are too old to return to Narnia. The Pevensies find themselves back at the railway station.\n\n\nThe two major themes of the story are courage and chivalry and, as Lewis himself said in a letter to an American girl, \"the restoration of the true religion after a corruption\".\n\nThe Telmarine conquest of Narnia, as depicted in the book, is in many ways similar to the historical Norman Conquest of England. Though there is no precise parallel in actual English history to the specific events of this book, the end result – \"Old Narnians\" and Telmarines becoming a single people and living together in harmony – is similar to the historical process of Saxons and Normans eventually fusing into a single English people.\n\nThe BBC adapted \"Prince Caspian\" in two episodes of the 1989 series of \"The Chronicles of Narnia\".\n\nThe second in the series of films from Walt Disney Pictures and Walden Media, titled \"\", was released in the US on 16 May 2008. The UK release date was 26 June 2008.\n\nThe book was the inspiration for a song of the same name on the Phish album \"Billy Breathes\".\n\nThe script for a stage adaptation was written by Erina Caradus and first performed in 2007.\n\n"}
{"id": "51503", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51503", "title": "Progressive rock", "text": "Progressive rock\n\nProgressive rock (shortened as prog; sometimes called art rock, classical rock or symphonic rock) is a broad genre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. Initially termed \"progressive pop\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk, or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \"progressive\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \"art\" and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing.\n\nProg is based on fusions of styles, approaches and genres, involving a continuous move between formalism and eclecticism. Due to its historical reception, prog's scope is sometimes limited to a stereotype of long solos, overlong albums, fantasy lyrics, grandiose stage sets and costumes, and an obsessive dedication to technical skill. While the genre is often cited for its merging of high culture and low culture, few artists incorporated literal classical themes in their work to any great degree, and only a handful of groups purposely emulated or referenced classical music.\n\nThe genre coincided with the mid 1960s economic boom that allowed record labels to allocate more creative control to their artists, as well as the new journalistic division between \"pop\" and \"rock\" that lent generic significance to both terms. Prog saw a high level of popularity in the early-to-mid 1970s, but faded soon after. Conventional wisdom holds that the rise of punk rock caused this, but several more factors contributed to the decline. Music critics, who often labelled the concepts as \"pretentious\" and the sounds as \"pompous\" and \"overblown\", tended to be hostile towards the genre or to completely ignore it. After the late 1970s, progressive rock fragmented in numerous forms. Some bands achieved commercial success well into the 1980s (albeit with changed lineups and more compact song structures) or crossed into symphonic pop, arena rock, or new wave.\n\nEarly groups who exhibited progressive features are retroactively described as \"proto-prog\". The Canterbury scene, originating in the late 1960s, denoted a subset of prog bands who emphasised the use of wind instruments, complex chord changes and long improvisations. Rock in Opposition, from the late 1970s, was more avant-garde, and when combined with the Canterbury style, created avant-prog. In the 1980s, a new subgenre, neo-progressive rock, enjoyed some commercial success, although it was also accused of being derivative and lacking in innovation. Post-progressive draws upon newer developments in popular music and the avant-garde since the mid 1970s.\n\nThe term \"progressive rock\" is synonymous with \"art rock\", \"classical rock\" and \"symphonic rock\". Historically, \"art rock\" has been used to describe at least two related, but distinct, types of rock music. The first is progressive rock as it is generally understood, while the second usage refers to groups who rejected psychedelia and the hippie counterculture in favour of a modernist, avant-garde approach. Similarities between the two terms are that they both describe a mostly British attempt to elevate rock music to new levels of artistic credibility. However, art rock is more likely to have experimental or avant-garde influences. \"Prog\" was devised in the 1990s as a shorthand term, but later became a transferable adjective, also suggesting a wider palette than that drawn on by the most popular 1970s bands.\n\nProgressive rock is varied and is based on fusions of styles, approaches and genres, tapping into broader cultural resonances that connect to avant-garde art, classical music and folk music, performance and the moving image. Although a unidirectional English \"progressive\" style emerged in the late 1960s, by 1967, progressive rock had come to constitute a diversity of loosely associated style codes. When the \"progressive\" label arrived, the music was dubbed \"progressive pop\" before it was called \"progressive rock\", with the term \"progressive\" referring to the wide range of attempts to break with standard pop music formula. A number of additional factors contributed to the acquired \"progressive\" label: lyrics were more poetic; technology was harnessed for new sounds; music approached the condition of \"art\"; some harmonic language was imported from jazz and 19th-century classical music; the album format overtook singles; and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing.\n\nCritics of the genre often limit its scope to a stereotype of long solos, overlong albums, fantasy lyrics, grandiose stage sets and costumes, and an obsessive dedication to technical skill. While progressive rock is often cited for its merging of high culture and low culture, few artists incorporated literal classical themes in their work to any great degree, and only a handful of groups purposely emulated or referenced classical music. Writer Emily Robinson says that the narrowed definition of \"progressive rock\" was a measure against the term's loose application in the late 1960s, when it was \"applied to everyone from Bob Dylan to the Rolling Stones\". Debate over the genre's criterion continued to the 2010s, particularly on Internet forums dedicated to prog.\n\nAccording to musicologists Paul Hegarty and Martin Halliwell, Bill Martin and Edward Macan authored major books about prog rock while \"effectively accept[ing] the characterization of progressive rock offered by its critics. ... they each do so largely unconsciously.\" Academic John S. Cotner contests Macan's view that progressive rock cannot exist without the continuous and overt assimilation of classical music into rock. Author Kevin Holm-Hudson agrees that \"progressive rock is a style far more diverse than what is heard from its mainstream groups and what is implied by unsympathetic critics.\"\n\nIn early references to the music, \"progressive\" was partly related to progressive politics, but those connotations were lost during the 1970s. On \"progressive music\", Holm-Hudson writes that it \"moves continuously between explicit and implicit references to genres and strategies derived not only from European art music, but other cultural domains (such as East Indian, Celtic, folk, and African) and hence involves a continuous aesthetic movement between formalism and eclecticism.\" Cotner also says that progressive rock incorporates both formal and eclectic elements, \"It consists of a combination of factors – some of them intramusical (\"within\"), others extramusical or social (\"without\").\"\n\nOne way of conceptualising rock and roll in relation to \"progressive music\" is that progressive music pushed the genre into greater complexity while retracing the roots of romantic and classical music. Sociologist Paul Willis believes: \"We must never be in doubt that 'progressive' music followed rock 'n' roll, and that it could not have been any other way. We can see rock 'n' roll as a deconstruction and 'progressive' music as a reconstruction.\" Author Will Romano states that \"rock itself can be interpreted as a progressive idea ... Ironically, and quite paradoxically, 'progressive rock', the classic era of the late 1960s through the mid- and late 1970s, introduces not only the explosive and exploratory sounds of technology ... but traditional music forms (classical and European folk) and (often) a pastiche compositional style and artificial constructs (concept albums) which suggests postmodernism.\"\n\nIn 1966, the level of social and artistic correspondence among British and American rock musicians dramatically accelerated for bands like the Beatles, the Beach Boys and the Byrds who fused elements of cultivated music with the vernacular traditions of rock. Progressive rock was predicated on the \"progressive\" pop groups from the 1960s who combined rock and roll with various other music styles such as Indian ragas, oriental melodies and Gregorian chants, like the Beatles and the Yardbirds. The Beatles' Paul McCartney said in 1967: \"we [the band] got a bit bored with 12 bars all the time, so we tried to get into something else. Then came Dylan, the Who, and the Beach Boys. ... We're all trying to do vaguely the same kind of thing.\" Rock music started to take itself seriously, paralleling earlier attempts in jazz (as swing gave way to bop, a move which did not succeed with audiences). In this period, the popular song began signalling a new possible means of expression that went beyond the three-minute love song, leading to an intersection between the \"underground\" and the \"establishment\" for listening publics.\n\nHegarty and Halliwell identify the Beatles, the Beach Boys, the Doors, the Pretty Things, the Zombies, the Byrds, the Grateful Dead and Pink Floyd \"not merely as precursors of prog but as essential developments of progressiveness in its early days\". According to musicologist Walter Everett, the Beatles' \"experimental timbres, rhythms, tonal structures, and poetic texts\" on their albums \"Rubber Soul\" (1965) and \"Revolver\" (1966) \"encouraged a legion of young bands that were to create progressive rock in the early 1970s\". Dylan's poetry, the Mothers of Invention's album \"Freak Out!\" (1966) and the Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" (1967) were all important in progressive rock's development. The productions of Phil Spector were key influences, as they introduced the possibility of using the recording studio to create music that otherwise could never be achieved. The same is said for the Beach Boys' \"Pet Sounds\" (1966), which Brian Wilson intended as an answer to \"Rubber Soul\" and which in turn influenced the Beatles when they made \"Sgt. Pepper's\".\n\nDylan introduced a literary element to rock through his fascination with the Surrealists and the French Symbolists, and his immersion in the New York City art scene of the early 1960s. The trend of bands with names drawn from literature, such as the Doors, Steppenwolf and the Ides of March, were a further sign of rock music aligning itself with high culture. Dylan also led the way in blending rock with folk music styles. This was followed by folk rock groups such as the Byrds, who based their initial sound on that of the Beatles. In turn, the Byrds' vocal harmonies inspired those of Yes, and British folk rock bands like Fairport Convention, who emphasised instrumental virtuosity. Some of these artists, such as the Incredible String Band and Shirley and Dolly Collins, would prove influential through their use of instruments borrowed from world music and early music.\n\n\"Pet Sounds\" and \"Sgt. Pepper's\", with their lyrical unity, extended structure, complexity, eclecticism, experimentalism, and influences derived from classical music forms, are largely viewed as beginnings in the progressive rock genre and as turning points wherein rock, which previously had been considered dance music, became music that was made for listening to. Between \"Pet Sounds\" and \"Sgt. Pepper's\", the Beach Boys released the single \"Good Vibrations\" (1966), dubbed a \"pocket symphony\" by Derek Taylor, who worked as a publicist for both groups. The song contained an eclectic array of exotic instruments and several disjunctive key and modal shifts. Scott Interrante of \"Popmatters\" wrote that its influence on progressive rock and the psychedelic movement \"can't be overstated\". Martin likened the song to the Beatles' \"A Day in the Life\" from \"Sgt. Pepper's\", in that they showcase \"the same reasons why much progressive rock is difficult to dance to\".\n\nAlthough \"Sgt. Pepper's\" was preceded by several albums that had begun to bridge the line between \"disposable\" pop and \"serious\" rock, it successfully gave an established \"commercial\" voice to an alternative youth culture and marked the point at which the LP record emerged as a creative format whose importance was equal to or greater than that of the single. Bill Bruford, a veteran of several progressive rock bands, said that \"Sgt. Pepper's\" transformed both musicians' ideas of what was possible and audiences' ideas of what was acceptable in music. He believed that: \"Without the Beatles, or someone else who had done what the Beatles did, it is fair to assume that there would have been no progressive rock.\" In the aftermath of \"Sgt. Pepper\", magazines such as \"Melody Maker\" drew a sharp line between \"pop\" and \"rock', thus eliminating the \"roll\" from \"rock and roll\" (which now refers to the 1950s style). The only artists who remained \"rock\" would be those who were considered at the vanguard of compositional forms, far from \"radio friendly\" standards, as Americans increasingly used the adjective \"progressive\" for groups like Jethro Tull, Family, East of Eden, Van Der Graaf Generator, and King Crimson.\n\nAccording to AllMusic: \"Prog-rock began to emerge out of the British psychedelic scene in 1967, specifically a strain of classical/symphonic rock led by the Nice, Procol Harum, and the Moody Blues (\"Days of Future Passed\").\" The availability of newly affordable recording equipment coincided with the rise of a London underground scene at which LSD was commonly used. Pink Floyd and Soft Machine functioned as house bands at all-night events at locations such as Middle Earth and the UFO Club, where they experimented with sound textures and long-form songs. Many psychedelic, folk rock and early progressive bands were aided by exposure from BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel. Jimi Hendrix, who rose to prominence in the London scene and recorded with a band of English musicians, initiated the trend towards virtuosity in rock music. The Scottish band 1-2-3, later renamed Clouds, were formed in 1966 and began performing at London clubs a year later. According to \"Mojo\" George Knemeyer: \"some claim [that they] had a vital influence on prog-rockers such as Yes, The Nice and Family.\"\n\nSymphonic rock artists in the late 1960s had some chart success, including the singles \"Nights in White Satin\" (the Moody Blues, 1967) and \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\" (Procol Harum, 1967). The Moody Blues established the popularity of symphonic rock when they recorded \"Days of Future Passed\" together with the London Festival Orchestra, and Procol Harum began to use a greater variety of acoustic instruments, particularly on their 1969 album \"A Salty Dog\". Classical influences sometimes took the form of pieces adapted from or inspired by classical works, such as Jeff Beck's \"Beck's Bolero\" and parts of the Nice's \"Ars Longa Vita Brevis\". The latter, along with such Nice tracks as \"Rondo\" and \"America\", reflect a greater interest in music that is entirely instrumental. \"Sgt. Pepper's\" and \"Days\" both represent a growing tendency towards song cycles and suites made up of multiple movements.\n\nSeveral bands that included jazz-style horn sections appeared, including Blood, Sweat & Tears and Chicago. Of these, Martin highlights Chicago in particular for their experimentation with suites and extended compositions, such as the \"Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon\" on \"Chicago II\". Jazz influences appeared in the music of British bands such as Traffic, Colosseum and If, together with Canterbury scene bands such as Soft Machine and Caravan. Canterbury scene bands emphasised the use of wind instruments, complex chord changes and long improvisations. Martin writes that in 1968, \"full-blown progressive rock\" was not yet in existence, but three bands released albums who would later come to the forefront of the music: Jethro Tull, Caravan and Soft Machine.\n\nThe term \"progressive rock\", which appeared in the liner notes of Caravan's 1968 self-titled debut LP, came to be applied to bands that used classical music techniques to expand the styles and concepts available to rock music. The Nice, the Moody Blues, Procol Harum and Pink Floyd all contained elements of what is now called progressive rock, but none represented as complete an example of the genre as several bands that formed soon after. Almost all of the genre's major bands, including Jethro Tull, King Crimson, Yes, Genesis, Van der Graaf Generator, ELP, Gentle Giant and Curved Air, released their debut albums during the years 1968–1970. Most of these were folk-rock albums that gave little indication of what the band's mature sound would become, but King Crimson's \"In the Court of the Crimson King\" (1969) was a fully formed example of the genre. Critics assumed the album to be the logical extension and development of late 1960s proto-progressive rock exemplified by the Moody Blues, Procol Harum, Pink Floyd and the Beatles. According to Macan, the album may be the most influential to progressive rock for crystallising the music of earlier \"proto-progressive bands ... into a distinctive, immediately recognizable style\".\n\nMost of the genre's major bands released their most critically acclaimed albums during the years 1971–1976. The genre experienced a high degree of commercial success during the early 1970s. Jethro Tull, ELP, Yes and Pink Floyd combined for four albums that reached number one in the US charts, and sixteen of their albums reached the top ten. Mike Oldfield's \"Tubular Bells\" (1973), an excerpt of which was used as the theme for the film \"The Exorcist\", sold 16 million copies.\n\nProgressive rock came to be appreciated overseas, but it mostly remained a European, and especially British, phenomenon. Few American bands engaged in it, and the purest representatives of the genre, such as Starcastle and Happy the Man, remained limited to their own geographic regions. This is at least in part due to music industry differences between the US and Great Britain. Cultural factors were also involved, as US musicians tended to come from a blues background, while Europeans tended to have a foundation in classical music. North American progressive rock bands and artists often represented hybrid styles such as the complex arrangements of Rush, the hard rock of Captain Beyond, the Southern rock-tinged prog of Kansas, the jazz fusion of Frank Zappa and Return to Forever, and the eclectic fusion of the all-instrumental Dixie Dregs. British progressive rock acts had their greatest US success in the same geographic areas in which British heavy metal bands experienced their greatest popularity. The overlap in audiences led to the success of arena rock bands, such as Boston, Kansas, and Styx, who combined elements of the two styles.\n\nProgressive rock achieved popularity in Continental Europe more quickly than it did in the US. Italy remained generally uninterested in rock music until the strong Italian progressive rock scene developed in the early 1970s. Few of the European groups were successful outside of their own countries, with the exceptions of bands like Focus, who wrote English-language lyrics, and Le Orme and PFM, whose English lyrics were written by Peter Hammill and Peter Sinfield, respectively. Some European bands played in a style derivative of English bands. The \"Kosmische music\" scene in Germany came to be labelled as \"krautrock\" internationally and is variously seen as part of the progressive rock genre or an entirely distinct phenomenon. Bands such as Can, which included two members who had studied under Karlheinz Stockhausen, tended to be more strongly influenced by 20th century classical music than the British bands, whose musical vocabulary leaned more towards the Romantic era. Many of these groups were very influential even among bands that had little enthusiasm for the symphonic variety of progressive rock.\n\nPolitical and social trends of the late 1970s shifted away from the early 1970s hippie attitudes that had led to the genre's development and popularity. The rise in punk cynicism made the utopian ideals expressed in progressive rock lyrics unfashionable. Virtuosity was rejected, as the expense of purchasing quality instruments and the time investment of learning to play them were seen as barriers to rock's energy and immediacy. There were also changes in the music industry, as record companies disappeared and merged into large media conglomerates. Promoting and developing experimental music was not part of the marketing strategy for these large corporations, who focused their attention on identifying and targeting profitable market niches.\n\nFour of progressive rock's most successful bands - King Crimson, Yes, ELP and Genesis - went on hiatus or (in Genesis' case) experienced major personnel changes during the mid-1970s. Macan notes the September 1974 breakup of King Crimson as particularly significant, calling it the point when \"all English bands in the genre should have ceased to exist.\" More of the major bands, including Van der Graaf Generator, Gentle Giant and U.K., dissolved between 1978 and 1980. Many bands had by the mid-1970s reached the limit of how far they could experiment in a rock context, and fans had wearied of the extended, epic compositions. The sounds of the Hammond, Minimoog and Mellotron had been thoroughly explored, and their use became clichéd. Those bands who continued to record often simplified their sound, and the genre fragmented from the late 1970s onwards. In Robert Fripp's opinion, once \"progressive rock\" ceased to cover new ground – becoming a set of conventions to be repeated and imitated – the genre's premise had ceased to be \"progressive\".\n\nThe era of record labels investing in their artists, giving them freedom to experiment and limited control over their content and marketing, ended with the late 1970s. Corporate artists and repertoire staff exerted an increasing amount of control over the creative process that had previously belonged to the artists, and established acts were pressured to create music with simpler harmony and song structures and fewer changes in meter. A number of symphonic pop bands, such as Supertramp, 10cc, the Alan Parsons Project and the Electric Light Orchestra, brought the orchestral-style arrangements into a context that emphasised pop singles while allowing for occasional instances of exploration. Jethro Tull, Gentle Giant and Pink Floyd opted for a harder sound in the style of arena rock.\n\nFew new progressive rock bands formed during this era, and those who did found that record labels were not interested in signing them. The short-lived supergroup U.K. was a notable exception since members had already established reputations, although they tended to carry on in the style of previous bands and did little to advance the genre. Some of the genre's more important development at this time occurred in its influence on other styles, as several guitarists with European ties brought a progressive rock approach to heavy metal and laid the groundwork for the future progressive metal style. Michael Schenker, of UFO, and Uli Jon Roth, who replaced Schenker in Scorpions, expanded the modal vocabulary available to guitarists. Roth studied classical music with the intent of using the guitar in the way that classical composers used the violin. Finally, the Dutch-born and classically trained Alex and Eddie Van Halen formed Van Halen, featuring ground-breaking whammy-bar, tapping & cross-picking guitar workand influencing \"shred\" music of the 1980s.\n\nSome established bands moved towards music that was simpler and more commercially viable. Echoes of progressive rock complexity could be heard in arena rock bands like Journey, Kansas, Styx, GTR, ELO and Foreigner, all of which either had begun as progressive rock bands or included members with strong ties to the genre. These bands retained some elements of the orchestral-style arrangements, but they moved away from lyrical mysticism in favour of teen-oriented songs about relationships. Genesis transformed into a successful pop act, and a re-formed Yes released the relatively mainstream \"90125\" (1983), which yielded their only US number-one single, \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\". These radio-friendly groups have been called \"prog lite\". One band who experienced great 1980s success while maintaining a progressive approach was Pink Floyd, who released \"The Wall\" late in 1979. The album, which brought punk anger into progressive rock, was a huge success and was later filmed as \"Pink Floyd – The Wall\".\n\nPunk and prog were not necessarily as opposed as is commonly believed. Both genres reject commercialism, and punk bands did see a need for musical advancement. Author Doyle Green says that post-punk emerged as \"a kind of progressive punk\". Post-punk artists rejected the high cultural references of 1960s rock artists like the Beatles and Bob Dylan as well as paradigms that defined rock as \"progressive\", \"art\", or \"studio perfectionism\". In contrast to punk rock, it balances punk's energy and skepticism with a re-engagement with an art school consciousness, Dadaist experimentalism, and atmospheric, ambient soundscapes. World music, especially African and Asian traditions, was also a major influence. Progressive rock's influence was felt in the work of some post-punk bands, although these bands tended not to draw on classical rock or Canterbury bands as influences but rather Roxy Music and krautrock bands, particularly Can. Groups showed some influence of prog along with their more usually recognised punk influences.\n\nThe term \"post-progressive\" identifies progressive rock that returns to its original principles while dissociating from established 1970s prog styles, and may be located after 1978. Martin credits Roxy Music's Brian Eno as the music's most important catalyst, explaining that his 1973–77 output merged aspects of progressive rock with a prescient notion of punk and new wave. New wave, which surfaced around 1978–79 with some of the same attitudes and aesthetic as punk, was characterised by Martin as \"progressive\" multiplied by \"punk\". Bands in the genre tended to be less hostile towards progressive rock than the punks, and there were crossovers, such as Fripp and Eno's involvement with Talking Heads, and Yes' replacement of Rick Wakeman and Jon Anderson with the pop duo the Buggles. When King Crimson reformed in 1981, they released an album, \"Discipline\", which Macan says \"inaugurated\" the new post-progressive style. According to Martin, Talking Heads also created \"a kind of new-wave music that was the perfect synthesis of punk urgency and attitude and progressive-rock sophistication and creativity. A good deal of the more interesting rock since that time is clearly 'post-Talking Heads' music, but this means that it is post-progressive rock as well.\"\n\nA second wave of progressive rock bands appeared in the early 1980s and have since been categorised as a separate \"neo-progressive rock\" subgenre. These largely keyboard-based bands played extended compositions with complex musical and lyrical structures. Several of these bands were signed by major record labels, including Marillion, IQ, Pendragon and Pallas. Most of the genre's major acts released debut albums between 1983 and 1985 and shared the same manager, Keith Goodwin, a publicist who had been instrumental in promoting progressive rock during the 1970s. The previous decade's bands had the advantage of appearing during a large countercultural movement that provided them with a large potential audience, but the neo-progressive bands were limited to a niche audience and found it difficult to attract a following. Only Marillion and Saga experienced international success.\n\nNeo-progressive bands tended to use Gabriel-era Genesis as their \"principal model\". They were also influenced by funk, hard rock and punk rock. The genre's most successful band, Marillion, suffered particularly from accusations of similarity to Genesis, although they used a different vocal style and a sound with more of a hard rock element. Authors Paul Hegarty and Martin Halliwell have pointed out that the neo-progressive bands were not so much plagiarising progressive rock as they were creating a new style from progressive rock elements, just as the bands of a decade before had created a new style from jazz and classical elements. Author Edward Macan counters by pointing out that these bands were at least partially motivated by a nostalgic desire to preserve a past style rather than a drive to innovate.\n\nA third wave of progressive rock bands, who might more properly be described as a second generation of neo-progressive bands, emerged in the 1990s. The use of the term \"progressive\" to describe groups that follow in the style of bands from ten to twenty years earlier is somewhat controversial, as it has been seen as a contradiction of the spirit of experimentation and progress. These new bands were aided in part by the availability of personal computer-based recording studios, which reduced album production expenses, and the Internet, which made it easier for bands outside of the mainstream to reach widely spread audiences. Record stores specialising in progressive rock appeared in large cities.\n\nThe shred music of the 1980s was a major influence on the progressive rock groups of the 1990s. Some of the newer bands, such as the Flower Kings, Spock's Beard and Glass Hammer, played a 1970s-style symphonic prog but with an updated sound. A number of them began to explore the limits of the CD in the way that earlier groups had stretched the limits of the vinyl LP.\n\nIn the 1990s, the American jam band scene was partly influenced by 1970s progressive rock. For instance, the popular group Phish were influenced by artists such as Genesis, Gong and Gentle Giant. Similarly, Umphrey's McGee were noted by journalists for their progressive rock stylings.\n\nProgressive rock and heavy metal have similar timelines. Both emerged from late-1960s psychedelia to achieve great early-1970s success despite a lack of radio airplay and support from critics, then faded in the late 1970s and experienced revivals in the early 1980s. Each genre experienced a fragmentation of styles at this time, and many metal bands from the new wave of British heavy metal onwards displayed progressive rock influences. Progressive metal reached a point of maturity with Queensrÿche's 1988 concept album \"\" and Voivod's 1989 \"Nothingface\", which featured abstract lyrics and a King Crimson-like texture.\n\nProgressive rock elements appear in other metal subgenres. Black metal is conceptual by definition, due to its prominent theme of questioning the values of Christianity. Its guttural vocals are sometimes used by bands who can be classified as progressive, such as Mastodon, Mudvayne and Opeth. Symphonic metal is an extension of the tendency towards orchestral passages in early progressive rock. Progressive rock has also served as a key inspiration for genres such as post-rock, post-metal and avant-garde metal, math rock, power metal and neo-classical metal.\n\nNew prog describes the wave of progressive rock bands in the 2000s who revived the genre. According to \"Entertainment Weekly\"s Evan Serpick: \"Along with recent success stories like System of a Down and up-and-comers like the Dillinger Escape Plan, Lightning Bolt, and Coheed and Cambria, the Mars Volta create incredibly complex and inventive music that sounds like a heavier, more aggressive version of ’70s behemoths such as Led Zeppelin and King Crimson.\"\n\nThe Progressive Music Awards were launched in 2012 by the British magazine \"Prog\" to honour the genre's established acts and to promote its newer bands. Honorees, however, are not invited to perform at the awards ceremony, as the promoters want an event \"that doesn't last three weeks\".\n\nMany prominent progressive rock bands got their initial exposure at large rock festivals that were held in Britain during the late 1960s and early 1970s. King Crimson made their first major appearance at the 1969 Hyde Park free concert, before a crowd estimated to be as large as 650,000, in support of the Rolling Stones. Emerson, Lake & Palmer debuted at the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival, at which Supertramp, Family and Jethro Tull also appeared. Jethro Tull were also present at the 1969 Newport Jazz Festival, the first year in which that festival invited rock bands to perform. Hawkwind appeared at many British festivals throughout the 1970s, although they sometimes showed up uninvited, set up a stage on the periphery of the event, and played for free.\nRenewed interest in the genre in the 1990s led to the development of progressive rock festivals. ProgFest, organised by Greg Walker and David Overstreet in 1993, was first held in UCLA's Royce Hall, and featured Sweden's Änglagård, the UK's IQ, Quill and Citadel. CalProg was held annually in Whittier, California during the 2000s. The North East Art Rock Festival, or NEARfest, held its first event in 1999 in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania and held annual sold-out concerts until 2012's NEARfest Apocalypse, which featured headliners U.K. and Renaissance. Other festivals include the annual ProgDay (the longest-running and only outdoor prog festival) in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, the annual Rites of Spring Festival (RoSfest) in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, The Rogue Independent Music Festival in Atlanta, Georgia, Baja Prog in Mexicali, Mexico, ProgPower USA in Atlanta, Georgia and ProgPower Europe in Baarlo, Netherlands. Progressive Nation tours were held in 2008 and 2009 with Dream Theater as the headline act. \"Night of the Prog\" in St Goarshausen (Germany) is an established European progressive rock festival held every July during 2–3 days for 12 years.\n\nThe genre has received both critical acclaim and criticism throughout the years. Progressive rock has been described as parallel to the classical music of Igor Stravinsky and Béla Bartók. This desire to expand the boundaries of rock, combined with some musicians' dismissiveness toward mainstream rock and pop, dismayed critics and led to accusations of elitism. Its intellectual, fantastic and apolitical lyrics, and shunning of rock's blues roots, were abandonments of the very things that many critics valued in rock music. Progressive rock also represented the maturation of rock as a genre, but there was an opinion among critics that rock was and should remain fundamentally tied to adolescence, so rock and maturity were mutually exclusive. Criticisms over the complexity of their music provoked some bands to create music that was even more complex.\n\nThe genre's greatest appeal is to white males. Most of the musicians involved were male, as was the case for most rock of the time, Female singers were better represented in progressive folk bands, who displayed a broader range of vocal styles than the progressive rock bands with whom they frequently toured and shared band members.\n\nBritish and European audiences typically followed concert hall behaviour protocols associated with classical music performances, and were more reserved in their behaviour than audiences for other forms of rock. This confused musicians during US tours, as they found American audiences less attentive and more prone to outbursts during quiet passages.\n\nThese aspirations towards high culture reflect progressive rock's origins as a music created largely by upper- and middle-class, white-collar, college-educated males from Southern England. The music never reflected the concerns of or was embraced by working-class listeners, except in the US, where listeners appreciated the musicians' virtuosity. Progressive rock's exotic, literary topics were considered particularly irrelevant to British youth during the late 1970s, when the nation suffered from a poor economy and frequent strikes and shortages. Even King Crimson leader Robert Fripp dismissed progressive rock lyrics as \"the philosophical meanderings of some English half-wit who is circumnavigating some inessential point of experience in his life\". Bands whose darker lyrics avoided utopianism, such as King Crimson, Pink Floyd and Van der Graaf Generator, experienced less critical disfavour.\n\n\"I wasn't a big fan of most of what you'd call progressive rock,\" remarked Floyd guitarist David Gilmour. \"I'm like Groucho Marx: I don't want to belong to any club that would have me for a member.\"\n\n\"I still like the original term that comes from 1969: progressive rock -- but that was with a small ‘p’ and a small ‘r.’ Prog Rock, on the other hand, has different connotations -- of grandeur and pomposity,\" commented Jethro Tull frontman Ian Anderson on the nuance of the genre. \"Back then, when we were doing 'Thick as a Brick,' bands like Yes and Emerson Lake and Palmer were already gaining a reputation for being a little pompous and showing off with their music. I think that was OK. The reality is that certain members of Yes were quite humorous about it; they could laugh at themselves -- as, indeed, Emerson Lake and Palmer privately laughed amongst themselves about themselves.\" He added, \"But that’s part of what was going on back then, and I think looking back on it that most of it was a pretty good experience for musicians and listeners alike. Some of it was a little bit overblown, but in the case of much of the music, it was absolutely spot on.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

Since then, public interest design—frequently described as a movement or field—has gained public recognition.\n\nPublic interest design grew out of the community design movement, which got its start in 1968 after American civil rights leader Whitney Young issued a challenge to attendees of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) national convention:\n\n\". . . \"you are not a profession that has distinguished itself by your social and civic contributions to the cause of civil rights, and I am sure this does not come to you as any shock. You are most distinguished by your thunderous silence and your complete irrelevance\".\"\n\nThe response to Young’s challenge was the establishment of community design centers (CDCs) across the United States. CDCs, which were often established with the support of area universities, provided a variety of design services – such as affordable housing - within their own neighborhoods.\n\nIn architecture schools, “design/build programs” provided outreach to meet local design needs, particularly in low-income and underserved areas. One of the earliest design/build programs was Yale University’s Vlock Building Project. The project, which was initiated by students at Yale University School of Architecture in 1967, requires graduate students to design and build low-income housing.\n\nOne of the most publicized programs is the Auburn University Rural Studio design/build program, which was founded in 1993. The Rural Studio’s first project, Bryant House, was completed in 1994 for $16,500.\n\nInterest in public interest design – particularly socially responsible architecture – began to grow during the 1990s and continued into the first decade of the new millennium. Conferences, books, and exhibitions began to showcase the design work being done beyond the community design centers, which had greatly decreased in numbers since their peak in the seventies.\n\nNon-profit organizations – including Architecture for Humanity, BaSiC Initiative, Design Corps, Public Architecture, Project H, Project Locus, and MASS Design Group – began to provide design services that served a larger segment of the population than had been served by traditional design professions.\n\nMany public interest design organizations also provide training and service-learning programs for architecture students and graduates. In 1999, the Enterprise Rose Architectural Fellowship was established, giving young architects the opportunity to work on three-year-long design and community development projects in low-income communities.\n\nTwo of the earliest formal public interest design programs include the Gulf Coast Community Design Studio at Mississippi State University and the Public Interest Design Summer Program at the University of Texas\n. In February 2015, Portland State University launched the first graduate certificate program in Public Interest Design in the United States.\n\nThe first professional-level training was conducted in July 2011 by the Public Interest Design Institute (PIDI) and held at the Harvard Graduate School of Design.\n\nAlso in 2011, a survey of American Institute of Architects (AIA), 77% of AIA members agreed that the mission of the professional practice of public interest design could be defined as the belief that every person should be able to live in a socially, economically, and environmentally healthy community.\n\nSeveral books have been published that showcase a variety of public interest design projects and practitioners:\n\n\nThe annual Structures for Inclusion conference showcases public interest design projects from around the world. The first conference, which was held in 2000, was called “Design for the 98% Without Architects.\" Speaking at the conference, Rural Studio co-founder Samuel Mockbee challenged attendees to serve a greater segment of the population: “I believe most of us would agree that American architecture today exists primarily within a thin band of elite social and economic conditions...in creating architecture, and ultimately community, it should make no difference which economic or social type is served, as long as the status quo of the actual world is transformed by an imagination that creates a proper harmony for both the affluent and the disadvantaged.\" \n\nIn 2007, the Cooper Hewitt National Design Museum held an exhibition, titled “Design for the Other 90%,” curated by Cynthia Smith. Following the success of this exhibit, Smith developed the \"Design Other 90\" initiative into an ongoing series, the second of which was titled “Design for the Other 90%: CITIES” (2011), held at the United Nations headquarters. In 2010, Andres Lipek of the Museum of Modern Art in New York curated an exhibit, called “Small Scale, Big Change: New Architectures of Social Engagement.”\n\nOne of the oldest professional networks related to public interest design is the professional organization is the Association for Community Design (ACD), which was founded in 1977.\n\nIn 2005, adopting a term coined by architect Kimberly Dowdell, the Social Economic Environmental Design (SEED) Network was co-founded by a group of community design leaders, during a meeting hosted by the Loeb Fellowship at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. The SEED Network established a common set of five principles and criteria for practitioners of public interest design. An evaluation tool called the SEED Evaluator is available to assist designers and practitioners in developing projects that align with SEED Network goals and criteria.\n\nIn 2006, the Open Architecture Network was launched by Architecture for Humanity in conjunction with co-founder Cameron Sinclair's TED Wish. Taking on the name Worldchanging in 2011, the network is an open-source community dedicated to improving living conditions through innovative and sustainable design. Designers of all persuasions can share ideas, designs and plans as well as collaborate and manage projects. while protecting their intellectual property rights using the Creative Commons \"some rights reserved\" licensing system.\n\nIn 2007, DESIGN 21: Social Design Network, an online platform built in partnership with UNESCO, was launched.\n\nIn 2011, the Design Other 90 Network was launched by the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, in conjunction with its Design with the Other 90%: CITIES exhibition.\n\nIn 2012, IDEO.org, with the support of The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, launched HCD Connect, a network for social sector leaders committed to human-centered design. In this context, human-centered design begins with the end-user of a product, place, or system — taking into account their needs, behaviors and desires. The fast-growing professional network of 15,000 builds on \"The Human-Centered Design Toolkit,\" which was designed specifically for people, nonprofits, and social enterprises that work with low-income communities throughout the world. People using the HCD Toolkit or human-centered design in the social sector now have a place to share their experiences, ask questions, and connect with others working in similar areas or on similar challenges.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14499166", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14499166", "title": "Scythian religion", "text": "Scythian religion\n\nScythian religion refers to the mythology, ritual practices and beliefs of the Scythians, an ancient Iranian people who dominated Central Asia and the Pontic-Caspian steppe in Eastern Europe throughout Classical Antiquity. What little is known of the religion is drawn from the work of the 5th century Greek historian and ethnographer Herodotus. Scythian religion is assumed to have been related to the earlier Proto-Indo-Iranian religion, and to have influenced later Slavic, Hungarian and Turkic mythologies, as well as some contemporary Eastern Iranian and Ossetian traditions. \n\nThe primary archaeological context of horse sacrifice are burials, notably chariot burials, but graves with horse remains reach from the Eneolithic well into historical times. Herodotus describes the execution of horses at the burial of a Scythian king, and Iron Age kurgan graves known to contain horses number in the hundreds.\n\nThe Scythians had some reverence for the stag, which is one of the most common motifs in their artwork, especially at funeral sites (see, for example, the Pazyryk burials). \n\nAccording to Herodotus, the Scythians worshipped a pantheon of seven gods and goddesses (heptad), which he equates with Greek divinities of Classical Antiquity following the \"interpretatio graeca\". He mentions eight deities in particular, the eighth being worshipped by the Royal Scythians, and gives the Scythian names for seven of them as follows:\n\nThe mode of Scythian animal sacrifice was, in the opinion of Herodotus, relatively simple. Sacrificial animals included various kinds of livestock, though the most prestigious offering was considered to be the horse. The pig, on the other hand, was never offered in sacrifice, and apparently the Scythians were loath to keep swine within their lands. Herodotus describes the Scythian manner of sacrifice as follows:\n\nAlthough Tabiti was apparently the most important deity in the Scythian pantheon, the worship accorded to the deity Herodotus refers to as \"Ares\" was unique. He notes that \"it is not their custom [...] to make images, altars or temples to any except Ares, but to him it is their custom to make them\". He describes the construction of the altar and the subsequent sacrifice as follows:\n\nAccording to Tadeusz Sulimirski, this form of worship continued among the descendants of the Scythians, the Alans, through to the 4th century CE.; this tradition may be reflected in Jordanes' assertion that Attila was able to assert his authority over the Scythians through his possession of the \"Sword of Mars\".\n\nThe \"Enarei\" were a privileged caste of hereditary priests which played an important political role in Scythian society as they were believed to have received the gift of prophesy directly from the goddess Argimpasa. The method employed by the \"Enarei\" differed from that practised by traditional Scythian diviners: whereas the latter used a bundle of willow rods, the \"Enarei\" used strips cut from the bark of the linden tree (genus \"tilia\") to tell the future. The \"Enarei\" were also noted for dressing themselves in the clothes of women, a custom which Herodotus understands as being reflected in the title \"ena-rei\", glossing this as \"ἀνδρό-γυνοι\" or \"man-women\".\n\n\n"}

It can be used ornamentally in crafts, like a kind of \"macrame\", or to make straw hats. Sennit is an important material in the cultures of Oceania, where it is used in traditional architecture, boat building, fishing and as an ornamentation.\n\nSennit in Tonga is called \"kafa.\"\n\nThe Fijian term used is \"magimagi\", a craft product of the Fiji Islands.\n\nThe term is also used in Hawaii and throughout Polynesia for cordage made by braiding the fibers of coconut husks. It was important in attaching the \"ama\" (outrigger float) via the \"iako\" (spars) to the hull of canoes, stones to war-club handles, erecting \"hale\" (houses), etc.\n\nIn the Samoan language, sennit is called \"afa\". It was used as cordage in the construction of traditional Samoan architecture, boat building with many other functional uses. \"Afa\" is handmade from dried coconut fibre from the husk of certain varieties of coconuts with long fibres, particularly the \"niu'afa\" (\"afa\" palm).\n\nSennit is mentioned in Robert Gibbings book \"Over the Reefs\" (1948). He refers to its use in Samoa in 1946, where he was able to observe its being made on many occasions. He notes that its crafting was a constant occupation in Samoan villages, because so much of the material was required. A significant quote from the book, made by a village chief to Gibbings, emphasises the importance of sennit in Samoan culture: \"In your country,\" said a chief to me, \"only a few men can make nails, but in Samoa, everyone can make nails\" (p. 118). He was referring to the sennit that is used to bind the structures or huts in which they lived. Sennit had a variety of other uses, including in shark fishing, where it was used as a noose that was placed over the shark's head as it came alongside the canoe.\n\n\"They showed me the sennit noose they had used—five years old and as good as new. They said it would last another five years if cared for.\" Robert Gribbings.\n\n"}

K. Rowling. It officially premiered on March 1, 2016 at the Youtube channel Broad Strokes Productions. The fan film caught the attention of BuzzFeed, \"Entertainment Weekly\", \"Time\",\n\"Elite Daily\",\n\"Business Insider\", \"The Huffington Post\",\nIGN,\n\"Seventeen\", Moviepilot, MTV, BBC America, PopSugar, \"The Independent\", and The Mary Sue.\n\nSeverus Snape is enjoying a drink in a bar when a stranger, whose face is covered, joins him. Asking Snape about himself, Snape tells him a story.\n\nSome time before, the Marauders - James Potter, Remus Lupin, Sirius Black and Peter Pettigrew - were in the same bar celebrating their graduation from Hogwarts. Upon seeing Snape, James challenges him to a duel. Before they all disapparate elsewhere, Lily Evans sees them.\n\nThey appear on a forest, and James and Snape start dueling. However, Snape eventually becomes victorious, so Remus, Sirius, and Peter join the fight, and they all produce the Fiendfyre spell, creating a big, four headed fire monster, with each head being their animal form. Snape disapparates to elsewhere in the forest, and Remus, Sirius and James do too, while Peter joins them on foot.\n\nUsing Legilimency, Snape predicts their next attack. However, the Marauders attack him at the same time, eventually having him cornered. Snape, remembering their bullying throughout the years, and Lily, rebounds the spells, applies the Cruciatus curse to Sirius, and Sectumsempra to Remus. Before cursing Peter, he transforms into a rat and escapes. Snape approaches James and attempts to kill him, but Lily apparates before him, demanding an explanation. Snape apologizes for calling her a mudblood (seen in a flashback in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\"). Lily tells Snape that she will forgive him if he changes and stops being with dark wizards, such as Bellatrix Lestrange. Lily disapparates with James, Remus, and Sirius.\n\nReturning to the first scene, the stranger tells Snape that he feels how it is to be subjugated. Snape demands to know who the stranger is, and he reveals his face: he is Lord Voldemort, answering \"You Know Who\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2905368", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2905368", "title": "Squaw", "text": "Squaw\n\nThe English word Squaw is an ethnic and sexual slur, historically used for Indigenous North American women. Contemporary use of the term, especially by non-Natives, is considered offensive, derogatory, misogynist and racist.\n\nThe English word is not used among Native American, First Nations, Inuit or Métis peoples. While a similar morpheme is found within some longer words in some of the Eastern Algonquian languages, these languages only make up a small minority of the languages spoken in the hundreds of Indigenous communities affected by this slur. Even in Algonquian, the words used are not the English-language slur, but longer, Algonquian words that only contain one morpheme. Eastern Algonquian morphemes meaning \"woman\", which are found as components in other words and may have been transcribed into English include the Massachusett language \"squa\", \"\"skwa\", \"esqua\", \"sqeh\", \"skwe\", \"que\", \"kwa\", \"ikwe\", \"exkwew\", \"xkwe\"\", and a number of other variants.\n\nTo date, the term persists in the officially sanctioned names of several municipalities, such as Squaw Grove Township, Illinois and Squaw Township, Iowa.\n\nThe term \"squaw\" is now universally offensive due to its use for hundreds of years in a derogatory context. Apart from any linguistic debate, the word \"squaw\" is offensive because of usage that demeans Native American women, ranging from condescending images (e.g., picture postcards depicting \"Indian squaw and papoose\") to racialized epithets. It treats non-white women as if they were second-class citizens or exotic objects.\n\nSome Native women have attempted to address this problem by calling attention to what they consider the appropriate indigenous context of this word (Palmer 2001). During a featured panel discussion titled \"Squaw: Algonkian Linguistics and Colonial Politics\" at the \"All Women of Red Nations\" Women's Studies Conference at Southern Connecticut State University in 2001, Native women from the Wampanoag and Schaghticoke Nations stressed the need for accurate understandings of colonial histories, and respect for linguistic differences, to avoid misrepresenting and disrespecting Algonquian language recovery efforts. \n\nNo matter the linguistic origins, many Native women feel that any \"reclamation\" efforts would only apply to a small percentage of Native women – those from the Algonquian language groups – while the slur has now been applied in a degrading manner to all Native women. And the history and depth of this slur is now too long, and too painful, for it to ever take on a positive meaning among Indigenous women or Indigenous communities as a whole. In 2015, Jodi Lynn Maracle (Mohawk) and Agnes Williams (Seneca) petitioned the Buffalo Common Council, to change the name of \"Squaw Island\" to \"Deyowenoguhdoh\". Seneca Nation President Maurice John Sr., and Chief G. Ava Hill of the Six Nations of the Grand River wrote letters petitioning for the name change as well, with Chief Hill writing, \n\nThe continued use and acceptance of the word 'Squaw' only perpetuates the idea that indigenous women and culture can be deemed as impure, sexually perverse barbaric and dirty ... Please do eliminate the slur 'Squaw' from your community.\n\nAnti-racist groups have also worked to educate about, and encourage the elimination of, the slur:\n\nWhen people say \"it never used to bother Indian women to be called squaw,\" respond with the following questions and statement.\n\nWhen people ask \"why now?\" explain that:\n\nReflecting efforts to be more culturally sensitive, several dictionaries now warn that \"squaw\" is considered to be, can be, or is offensive (NSOED, Merriam-Webster, and American Heritage, respectively).\n\nIn most colonial texts Squaw was used as general word for Indigenous women. It also became a derogatory adjective used against some men, in \"squaw man,\" meaning either \"a man who does woman's work\" (similar to other languages) or \"a white man married to an Indian woman and living with her people\" (Hodge 1910). (This was a popular literary stereotype, as in \"The Squaw Man\".)\n\nIn a western novel by Max Brand (1926), a male character asks a female character about her intentions:\n\nThe writer Mourning Dove (1927), of Colville, Okanagan and Irish ancestry, showed her mixed-race heroine's opinion of the word:\n\nIf I was to marry a white man and he would dare call me a 'squaw'—as an epithet with the sarcasm that we know so well—I believe that I would feel like killing him.\n\nPerhaps in view of such uses as those above, one early-20th-century dictionary of American usage called \"squaw\" \"a contemptuous term\" (Crowell 1928).\n\nThe activist LaDonna Harris, telling of her work in empowering Native American schoolchildren in the 1960s at Ponca City, Oklahoma, recounted:\n\nWe tried to find out what the children found painful about school [causing a very high dropout rate]. (...) The children said that they felt humiliated almost every day by teachers calling them \"squaws\" and using all those other old horrible terms (Harris 2000).\n\nIn this case the term seems to have been regularly applied to girls in the lower grades of the elementary school, long before their puberty.\n\nAn early comment in which \"squaw\" appears to have a sexual meaning is from the Canadian writer Pauline Johnson (1892), whose father was a Mohawk chief. She wrote about the title character in \"An Algonquin Maiden\" by G. Mercer Adam and A. Ethelwyn Wetherald:\n\nPoor little Wanda! not only is she non-descript and ill-starred, but as usual the authors take away her love, her life, and last and most terrible of all, reputation; for they permit a crowd of men-friends of the hero to call her a \"squaw\" and neither hero nor authors deny that she is a squaw. It is almost too sad when so much prejudice exists against the Indians, that any one should write up an Indian heroine with such glaring accusations against her virtue, and no contradictory statements from either writer, hero or circumstance.\n\nExplicit statements that \"squaw\" came from a word meaning \"female genitals\" gained currency in the 1970s. Perhaps the first example was in Sanders and Peek (1973):\n\nThat curious concept of 'squaw', the enslaved, demeaned, voiceless childbearer, existed and exists only in the mind of the non-Native American and is probably a French corruption of the Iroquois word \"otsiskwa\" [also spelled \"ojiskwa\"] meaning 'female sexual parts', a word almost clinical both denotatively and connotatively. The corruption suggests nothing about the Native American's attitude toward women; it does indicate the \"'s\" [white man's] view of Native American women in particular if not all women in general.\n\nOne of its earliest appearances in print is \"the squa sachim, or queen\" in \"Mourt's Relation\" (1622), one of the first chronicles of the Plymouth colony (Goddard 1997). William Wood similarly defined \"Squaw – a woman\" in his list, \"A Small Nomenclature of the Indian Language,\" in \"New England's Prospect\" (Wood 1637). \nThe adjective form of \"squaw\" has been widely used in English-language names invented by colonists, given to indigenous plants used by Native peoples as medicines specific to female complaints. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" notes:\n\nIn names of plants, as squaw-berry, the edible berry of one of several shrubs, esp. the bear-berry, \"Arctostaphylos uva-ursi\", an evergreen prostrate creeper; squaw corn, a variety of maize having soft grains of various colours; squaw huckleberry, -root, -weed, whortleberry (see quots.). Also squaw-bush, -carpet, -flower, -grass, -mint, -vine (OED 1989).\n\nThe \"Handbook of American Indians North of Mexico\" lists several such plants that are still prized by both traditional herbalists and modern pharmaceutical companies.\n\nAfter the squaw have been named: Squawberry (the partridge berry), squaw bush (in various parts of the country, \"Cornus stolonifera,\" \"C. sericea,\" and \"C. canadensis\") ... squaw flower (\"Trillium erectum,\" also called squaw root) ... squaw mint (the American pennyroyal), squawroot (in different parts of the country, \"Trillium erectum,\" the black and the blue cohosh, \"Conopholis americana,\" and other plants) ... squaw vine (a New England name for the partridge berry) (Hodge 1910).\n\nIn 1940, the anthropologist Frank Speck noted the appearance of this morpheme in various terms in the Penobscot language, including the following.\n\nnȣkskwe'sis = girl, nȣkskwe = young woman, na'kskwe'si'zak = a call for women to come and dance, Mi'kmaskwe'sis = a little Micmac woman, agwuskwe'zun = women's head coverings, gwanuskwa'kwsȣsak = long, peaked hood-like caps so characteristic of the northern peoples (Speck 1940)\n\nThe United States Board on Geographic Names currently does not ban the use of the word \"squaw\" in placenames (only two slurs are banned at the federal level). Despite this, Indigenous activists have continued to work both locally and in more general educational efforts, to rename the locations across America that contain the slur, as well as to eliminate the slur from the lexicon in general.\n\n\nAs of November 2018, Squaw Valley Ski Resort, Squaw Valley (Oregon), Squaw Valley (Fresno County, California), Squaw Peak Inn, Squaw Lake (California), Squaw Lake (Minnesota), Squaw Lake (New York), Squaw Grove Township (DeKalb County, Illinois), Squaw Mountain Ranch, Squaw Valley Academy, Squaw Canyon Oil Field, Squaw Cap (New Brunswick), Squaw Creek Southern Railroad, Squaw Gap (North Dakota), and Squaw Creek (Payette River), to name a few, remain unchanged.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "246363", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=246363", "title": "Terminator (franchise)", "text": "Terminator (franchise)\n\nThe Terminator series is an American science-fiction franchise created by James Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd. It encompasses a series of films, comics, novels, and additional media concerning battles between Skynet's synthetic intelligent machine network, and John Connor's Resistance forces and the rest of the human race. Skynet's most well-known products in its genocidal goals are the various terminator models, such as the T-800 (Model 101), who was portrayed by Arnold Schwarzenegger from the original film in 1984, and similar units he also portrayed in the later films. As of February 2010, the franchise has generated $3 billion in revenue.\n\nThe central theme of the franchise is the battle for survival between the nearly-extinct human race and the world-spanning synthetic intelligence that is Skynet. Skynet is positioned in the first film as a U.S. strategic \"Global Digital Defense Network\" computer system by Cyberdyne Systems which becomes self-aware. Upon activation, it immediately perceives all humans as a \"security threat\", and formulates a plan to systematically wipe out humanity itself. The system initiates a nuclear first strike against Russia, thereby ensuring a devastating second strike and a nuclear holocaust which it anticipates will instantly wipe out much of humanity. Indeed, it does, with approximately 3 billion casualties – more than half of the total human population at the time – in the resulting nuclear war. In the post-apocalyptic aftermath, Skynet later builds up its own autonomous machine-based military capability which includes the Terminators used against individual human targets and, therefore, proceeds to wage a persistent total war against the surviving elements of humanity, some of whom have militarily organized themselves into a Resistance. At some point in this future, Skynet develops the ability of time travel, and both it and the Resistance seek to use this technology in order to win the war; either by altering or accelerating past events in Skynet's favour, or by preventing or forestalling the (present) apocalyptic timeline.\n\nIn the franchise, Judgment Day (a reference to the biblical Day of Judgment) is referred to as the date on which Skynet becomes self-aware, decides to exterminate mankind, and launches a nuclear attack on Russia to provoke a nuclear counter-strike against the United States. Due to time travel and consequent ability to change the future, several differing dates are given for Judgment Day in different films in the franchise. In \"\", Sarah states that Judgment Day will occur on August 29, 1997. However, due to the attack on Cyberdyne Systems in the second film, \"\" shows that the Judgment Day holocaust has been postponed to July 25, 2004. In the separate chronology of \"\", the attack on Cyberdyne Systems in the second film delayed Judgment Day to April 21, 2011.\n\nIn \"Terminator Genisys\", the fifth film in the franchise, Judgment Day was believed to have been postponed to an unspecified day in October 2017, attributed to altered events in both the future and the past. Sarah and Kyle time travel to 2017 and seemingly defeat Skynet but the system core, contained inside a subterranean blast shelter, secretly survives, thus further delaying Judgment Day.\n\nThe real-world passing of April 21, 2011, the date for Judgment Day in \"Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles\", prompted BBC News to pose the question, \"How close were the \"Terminator\" films to the reality of 2011?\". This television news spot attempted to compare and contrast how far present day technology and society had developed in relation to the predictions of the motion picture franchise.\n\n\"The Terminator\" is a 1984 science fiction film released by Orion Pictures, co-written and directed by James Cameron and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn. It is the first work in the \"Terminator\" franchise. In the film, machines take over the world in the near future, directed by the artificial intelligence Skynet. With its sole mission to completely annihilate humanity, it develops android assassins called Terminators that outwardly appear human. A man named John Connor starts the Tech-Com resistance to fight the machines, defeat Skynet and free humanity. With a human victory imminent, the machines' only choice is to send a Terminator back in time to kill John's mother, Sarah Connor, and prevent the boy's birth, thereby handicapping the resistance from ever being founded in the first place. With the fate of humanity at stake, John sends soldier Kyle Reese back to protect his mother and ensure his own existence. Also starring Emmy winner Paul Winfield. It was released on October 26, 1984 to critical acclaim and grossed $78.4 million worldwide.\n\n\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\" is the 1991 sequel to the original \"Terminator\" film and released by TriStar Pictures. It is co-written, directed, and produced by James Cameron and stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong, Robert Patrick, and Joe Morton. After machines fail to prevent John Connor from being born, they try again in 1995, this time attempting to terminate him as a child by using a more advanced Terminator, the T-1000. As before, John sends back a protector for his younger self, a reprogrammed Terminator, who is a doppelgänger to the one from the previous film. After eleven years of preparing for the future war, Sarah decides to use the same tactics the machines used on her: preventing Skynet from being invented by destroying Cyberdyne Systems before they create it. It was released on July 3, 1991 to critical acclaim and grossed $523.7 million worldwide. Additionally, it also won several Academy Awards, one most notably for its then-cutting edge computer animation. The film was remastered for 3D and re-released in August 2017.\n\n\"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\", released by Warner Bros. Pictures domestically and Columbia Pictures internationally, is the 2003 sequel to \"Terminator 2\" and is written by John Brancato, Michael Ferris, directed by Jonathan Mostow and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Nick Stahl, Claire Danes and Kristanna Loken. As a result of the destruction of Cyberdyne at the end of \"Terminator 2\", the Skynet takeover has been postponed, not averted. In an attempt to ensure a victory by the machines, a new Terminator, the T-X, is sent back to terminate the lives of as many of John Connor's future lieutenants as is possible, including John Connor himself and his future wife Kate Brewster. In addition, the T-X's second mission is to assassinate Kate's father, General Robert Brewster (David Andrews), who is Skynet's primary creator, along with his staff; it anticipates that John and Kate would attempt to seek the general's help in stopping Skynet. After Connor's future self is terminated by a doppelgänger of his previous protector, Kate reprograms it and sends it back to save them both from the T-X. It was released on July 2, 2003 to mixed reviews and grossed $433.4 million worldwide.\n\n\"Terminator Salvation\" is the fourth installment of the \"Terminator\" film series, and was made by The Halcyon Company and again distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures and Columbia Pictures with an original release on May 21, 2009 to mixed reviews and which grossed $371.4 million. It was written by John Brancato and Michael Ferris, directed by McG, and stars Christian Bale as John Connor. Following the events of \"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\", after Skynet has destroyed much of humanity in a nuclear holocaust, John struggles to become the leader of humanity to which he is destined. In this future, Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington, who was personally recommended by James Cameron) has somehow altered it, and the T-101 (Roland Kickinger with CG-rendered facial likeness of Arnold Schwarzenegger) is coming online sooner than expected. The film also involves Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) and how he became the man he was in the first film. The film also stars Bryce Dallas Howard, Moon Bloodgood, Common, Michael Ironside and Helena Bonham Carter.\n\n\"Terminator Genisys\" is the fifth installment of the franchise, and, in addition, serves as a reboot that features the main characters from the first two films created by James Cameron, Gale Anne Hurd and William Wisher, Jr., portrayed by a new cast with the exception of Arnold Schwarzenegger reprising his role as the eponymous character. Additionally, Oscar winner J. K. Simmons joined the cast as Detective O'Brien, serving as an ally for the film's protagonists. The feature-length production was written by Laeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier, and directed by Alan Taylor. It was made by Skydance Productions and distributed by Paramount Pictures. The story takes place in an alternate reality resulting from a chain of events related to Skynet's (Matt Smith) actions throughout a previous timeline. Prior to this alteration, on the verge of winning the war against Skynet, John Connor (Jason Clarke) sends his trusted right-hand officer Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) back through time to save his mother's life and ensure his own existence, but Kyle arrives at an alternate timeline where Skynet had never launched its initial attack in 1997, and, therefore, Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke) was brought up by a reprogrammed Terminator (Schwarzenegger), sent by an unknown party to be her guardian ever since childhood. Now Sarah, Kyle and the Guardian need to escape the T-800 Model 101 (Brett Azar with CG-rendered likeness of Schwarzenegger from the first film), the T-1000 (Lee Byung-hun) and Skynet's mysterious nanocyte prototype: the T-3000, in an attempt to stop Judgment Day from ever happening; while trying to uncover the secrets behind Cyberdyne Systems' new application software: \"Genisys\". Assisting the trio is Detective O'Brien (Simmons), whose investigation into Terminators and time travelers lead him to learn about Skynet, and helps the protagonists in their mission to avert Judgment Day. The film was released on July 1, 2015 and grossed $440.6 million worldwide.\n\nSkydance Productions confirmed in September 2013 that \"Terminator Genisys\" was intended to be the first film in a new stand-alone trilogy. Matt Smith's character, the T-5000, was set to appear in all three films of the new series. In September 2014, Paramount Pictures scheduled the release dates of May 19, 2017 and June 29, 2018 for the sequels to \"Genisys\". Franchise creator James Cameron will acquire the rights back in 2019, as copyright reversion takes place after 35 years. Cameron will be the beneficiary of changes to the series.\n\nIn October 2015, it was announced that the \"Terminator Genisys\" sequels were on hold due to the film underperforming at the box office. Skydance chief creative officer Dana Goldberg commented at The Wrap’s Annual Media Leadership Conference that the franchise was not on hold, just ‘re-adjusting’. In January 2016, it was revealed that a sequel to \"Terminator Genisys\" had been removed from Paramount's 2017 release schedule, in favor of a \"Baywatch\" film adaptation starring Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron. In March 2017, Schwarzenegger stated that a sixth film was still in development.\n\nIn January 2017, it was announced that Cameron will return to the franchise and produce the next movie, with director Tim Miller signed on, and the two of them collaborating. In March 2017, David Ellison, CEO of Skydance, stated that the future of the franchise had been figured out and that an announcement of those plans would be coming soon. In May 2017, Arnold Schwarzenegger confirmed that he will return in the film and that James Cameron will be integral in developing the future of the franchise. In July of the same year, Cameron stated that the film rights will revert to him and that he and Ellison were planning the future of the franchise, with a three-film story arc being developed. The first draft of the script had a deadline, which was met. Schwarzenegger later revealed the intended shooting date as March 2018. By September, Skydance Pictures officially confirmed that Miller will be the film's director.\n\nOn September 19, 2017, during the question and answer session after a special screening of \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day 3D\", James Cameron officially announced that Linda Hamilton will return to the series to reprise her role as Sarah Connor. The story treatment was written by James Cameron himself, serving as the outline for the writers' room. Cameron and Miller meet in-person once a week to discuss the film in detail and talk via phone daily to discuss the writing process. Miller stated that the tone will be the same as the first two films. Cameron and Miller jointly acknowledged that the focus of the film is not to create more sequels or generate revenue, but to instead create the proper sequel, with the goal being to just make a good movie. However, there is a plan for a trilogy that would conclude the story should this first film prove successful.\n\nThe writers' room consisted of Josh Friedman, creator of \"Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles\", David S. Goyer, Justin Rhodes and Billy Ray. The creative team has stated that the new film will feature a young 18 to 21 year-old, who could potentially lead the franchise should the first film be successful. Cameron declined to reveal the nature of the new Terminator villain at the event, stating it would \"ruin the surprise\", but was referred to by Cameron as \"he\" and \"really cool\". The director also made mention of creating a theme park attraction akin to \"\" should the film prove successful. At a fan event in Birmingham, England, Arnold Schwarzenegger confirmed that Linda Hamilton had begun training for the film. He also confirmed that because the series deals with time-travel, the film ignores the premise of other movies and the TV show in the series and will not be titled \"Terminator 6\", but will be a direct sequel to \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\". The film is scheduled to be released on July 26, 2019. On March 8, 2018, it was announced that Mackenzie Davis had been cast to star in the upcoming film. The intended shooting time has been revealed to have been moved from March to June, Cameron citing the casting for the new lead role as the reason. In April 2018, the film's release date was delayed to November 22, 2019. The same month, Diego Boneta, Natalia Reyes and Gabriel Luna were cast as primary characters in the film.\n\nThe film's shooting first took place in Isleta del Moro, Almería on June 4, 2018, shooting for a month there, before shooting the rest in America. Jude Collie and Brett Azar have also been cast as a young John Connor and a younger T-800, respectively.\n\nA television series titled \"Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles,\" created by Josh Friedman, is a direct sequel to the second film and ignores the events of the following installments. The series follows Sarah (Lena Headey) and John Connor (Thomas Dekker) as they try to \"live under the radar\", after the explosion at Cyberdyne. Summer Glau plays a Terminator named Cameron and Brian Austin Green plays Derek Reese, the brother of , both sent back in time to protect the Connors and prevent Judgment Day.\n\nOn May 18, 2009, Machinima released \"Terminator Salvation: The Machinima Series\", an animated web series set between the events of \"\" and \"Terminator Salvation\", comprising six episodes. Set in 2016, twelve years after Judgment Day. The series follows Blair Williams (voiced by Moon Bloodgood) who is fighting the war against the machines in downtown Los Angeles, while tracking down the computer hacker named Laz Howard (voiced by Cam Clarke) and trying to pursue him to join sides with the resistance. The series was created using real-time computer animation from the video game and serves as a prequel to the game. It was distributed by Warner Premiere, produced by Wonderland Sound and Vision and The Halcyon Company and was released on DVD on November 3, 2009.\n\nOn May 9, 2007, it was announced that production rights to the \"Terminator\" series had passed from the feuding of Andrew G. Vajna and Mario Kassar to The Halcyon Company. The producers of the company hoped to start a new trilogy based on the franchise. But due to the box office failure of the fourth film and legal troubles, the \"Terminator Salvation\" trilogy was cancelled.\n\nDuring the production of \"Terminator Genisys\", the producers of the film hoped to start a new trilogy of films, with \"Terminator Genisys\" being the first of the three films. Due to the film being a commercial disappointment, this idea was scrapped in favor of the direct sequel to \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\".\n\nBy December 2013, Skydance Productions and Annapurna Pictures were developing a new \"Terminator\" television series. Ashley Miller and Zack Stentz, who had worked together previously on \"Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles\", were named as writers and executive producers. The series was said to deviate from the franchise's history at a critical moment in 1984's \"The Terminator\", and would also integrate with the then-projected film series' direct sequels to \"Terminator Genisys\". With the rights reverting to James Cameron in 2019, the planned television series connected to \"Terminator Genisys\" has since been cancelled.\n\nKey\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%; font-size:85%\"\n! rowspan=\"3\" style=\"width:12%;\" | Characters\n! colspan=\"6\" | Films\n!

{"id": "2930527", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2930527", "title": "The Distinguished Gentleman", "text": "The Distinguished Gentleman\n\nThe Distinguished Gentleman is a 1992 American political comedy film starring Eddie Murphy. The film was directed by Jonathan Lynn. In addition to Murphy, the film stars Lane Smith, Sheryl Lee Ralph, Joe Don Baker, James Garner, Victoria Rowell, Grant Shaud, Kevin McCarthy, Charles S. Dutton, Victor Rivers, Chi McBride, Sonny Jim Gaines, and Noble Willingham.\n\nThe film's plot is centered on politics, specifically what members of Congress and lobbyists do to get what they want in Washington, D.C.\n\nA Florida con man named Thomas Jefferson Johnson uses the passing of the longtime Congressman from his district, Jeff Johnson (who died of a heart attack while having sex with his secretary), to get elected to the United States Congress as a freshman Congressman, where the money flows from lobbyists. Omitting his first name, and abbreviating his middle name, he calls himself \"Jeff\" Johnson. He then manages to get on the ballot by pitching a seniors organization, the Silver Foxes, to nominate him as their candidate for office.\n\nOnce on the election ballot, he uses the dead Congressman's old campaign material and runs a low budget campaign that appeals to name recognition, figuring most people do not pay much attention and simply vote for the \"name you know.\" He wins a slim victory and is off to Washington, a place where the \"streets are lined with gold.\"\n\nInitially, the lucrative donations and campaign contributions roll in, but as he learns the nature of the con game in Washington D.C., he starts to see how the greed and corruption makes it difficult to address issues such as campaign finance reform, environmental protection, and the possibility that electric power companies may have a product that is giving kids in a small town cancer.\n\nIn trying to address these issues, Congressman Johnson finds himself double-crossed by the Chairman of the Committee on Power and Industry, Rep. Dick Dodge. Johnson decides to fight back the only way he knows how: with a con. Johnson succeeds and exposes Dodge as corrupt. As the film ends, it appears likely that Johnson will be thrown out of Congress for the manner in which he was elected, but he defiantly declares, \"I'm gonna run for President!\" then breaking the fourth wall.\n\n\nEddie Murphy appeared in this Disney-produced film after a string of Paramount Pictures star vehicles. Bernie Weinraub, film reviewer for \"The New York Times\", offered his opinion that Murphy wished to \"move beyond the tepid material\" he had been given by Paramount. Writer and producer Marty Kaplan said of Murphy's involvement \"I feel like I've come close to winning the jackpot\".\n\nThe film was shot at various locations in Washington, D.C.; Los Angeles; Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; Maryland, and Pasadena, California.\n\n\"The Distinguished Gentleman\" was released in December 1992 and went on to gross approximately $47 million at the domestic box office. Critical reaction to the movie however was mostly negative. Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" liked the premise and what it had going for it, but criticized it for its \"slow pacing\", despite it being a screwball comedy. Owen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" called it \"a sterile, joyless comedy, photographed in ugly, made-for-video close-up and featuring a farce plot so laborious it suggests John Landis on a bad day\". eFilmCritic.com called it a \"tepid Eddie Murphy political farce\", and the film currently holds a 13% \"Rotten\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nThe movie won the feature film Environmental Media Award in 1993, and in 2001 the Political Film Society gave the film its special award of the year.\n\n"}

Based on the Lego line of construction toys, the story focuses on an ordinary Lego minifigure who finds himself being the only one to help a resistance stop a tyrannical businessman from gluing everything in the Lego worlds into his vision of perfection. Chris Pratt, Will Ferrell, Elizabeth Banks, Will Arnett, Nick Offerman, Alison Brie, Charlie Day, Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman provide their voices for the film's main characters.\n\nThe first film produced by the Warner Animation Group, \"The Lego Movie\" was released on February 7, 2014 by Warner Bros. Pictures. It became a critical and commercial success, grossing $469 million worldwide against a $60 million budget and receiving praise for its visual style, humor, voice acting and heartwarming message. The film won the BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film, the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Animated Feature and the Saturn Award for Best Animated Film; it was also nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song for \"Everything Is Awesome\".\n\nThe film has since expanded into a major franchise which ties into the Lego brand, with a sequel to the film, entitled \"\", scheduled for release on February 8, 2019. A spin-off film, \"The Lego Batman Movie\", was released to theaters on February 10, 2017, with a second spin-off, \"The Lego Ninjago Movie\", released September 22, 2017. A third spin-off, \"The Billion Brick Race\", is in development. A 4D film based on the film itself, entitled \"\", was released to Legoland parks across the world after its premiere at Legoland Florida on January 29, 2016.\n\nThe film is dedicated to Kathleen Fleming, the former director of entertainment development of the Lego company, following her death in Cancún, Mexico in April 2013.\n\nIn the Lego universe, around the mid to late 2000s, populated by anthropomorphic minifigures, the evil Lord Business finds a super-weapon called the \"Kragle\". The wizard Vitruvius attempts to stop him, but is blinded by Business's robots. Before Business leaves with the weapon, Vitruvius prophesies a person called \"The Special\" will find the \"Piece of Resistance\", a brick capable of stopping the Kragle.\n\nEight and a half years later, in the city of Bricksburg, construction worker Emmet Brickowski has a very \"awesome\" day, and pretends that everything in the whole world, even the negative things, are awesome. During after hours, he finds a woman searching for something at his construction site. When he investigates, Emmet falls into a hole and finds the Piece of Resistance. Compelled to touch it, Emmet experiences vivid visions and passes out. He awakens with the Piece of Resistance attached to his back, in the custody of Good Cop/Bad Cop, Lord Business's lieutenant.\n\nThe woman, whos name she tells him is Wyldstyle, rescues Emmet, believing him to be the Special, and takes him to meet Vitruvius in the Old West. Emmet learns Wyldstyle and Vitruvius are \"Master Builders\" – people capable of building anything from their imagination without the need of instructions – who oppose Business. Wyldstyle explains that Business wants to use the Kragle (a tube of Krazy Glue with a weathered label) to freeze the world into perfection. Though disappointed to find Emmet is not a Master Builder, Wyldstyle and Vitruvius are convinced of his potential when he recalls visions of a seemingly human deity referred to as \"The Man Upstairs\".\n\nEmmet, Wyldstyle and Vitruvius evade Bad Cop's forces with the aid of Batman, Wyldstyle's boyfriend. They go to the hidden realm of Cloud Cuckoo Land to attend a council of Master Builders, all of whom are unimpressed with Emmet and refuse to fight Business. Bad Cop's forces attack, having placed a tracking device on Emmet, and capture everyone except Emmet, Wyldstyle, Batman, Vitruvius, and a small group of other Master Builders, and Cloud Cuckoo Land is destroyed. Later, Wyldstyle reveals her real name to be Lucy. Escaping, Emmet devises a plan to infiltrate Business's office tower and disarm the Kragle, but the group is captured and imprisoned in the Think Tank, where all the Master Builders are forced to make instructions. Trying to retaliate, Vitruvius is decapitated by Business, who sets a self-destruct protocol and leaves everyone to die, including Bad Cop.\n\nAs he dies, Vitruvius reveals he made up the prophecy. He soon reappears to Emmet as a ghost and reveals self-belief is what makes one the Special. Strapped to the self-destruct mechanism's battery, Emmet jumps into the abyss outside the tower and severs the connection, saving his friends. Inspired by Emmet's sacrifice, Wyldstyle rallies the Lego people across the universe to use whatever creativity they have to build machines and weapons to fight against Lord Business's forces.\n\nEmmet finds himself in the human world as a Lego mini-figure, unable to move. The events of the story are being played out by a little boy named Finn on his father's expensive Lego set in their basement. His father, \"The Man Upstairs\", comes home from work and is horrified to see his son ruining the set by creating variations of different playsets, and immediately proceeds to rebuild and glue his perceived perfect creations together. Realizing the danger his friends are in, Emmet wills himself to move and gains Finn's attention.\n\nFinn returns Emmet and the Piece of Resistance to the set, where Emmet now possesses the powers of a Master Builder and confronts Business. Meanwhile, Finn's father looks at his son's creations and realizes Finn had based the villainous Business on him and his perfectionism. Through a speech Emmet gives Business, Finn's father comes to his senses and tearfully apologizes to his son, and the two unglue the constructions with mineral spirits, which plays out as Business getting finally freed from his evil nature, capping the Kragle, and thawing his victims. Emmet is hailed as a hero and begins a romantic relationship with Wyldstyle with Batman's blessing.\n\nAs a result of Finn's father allowing Finn's younger sister to join them in playing with his Lego sets, aliens from the planet Duplon beam down on the Lego world and announce their plans to destroy everyone.\n\n\nAnthony Daniels and Billy Dee Williams reprise their \"Star Wars\" roles of C-3PO and Lando Calrissian, respectively, with Keith Ferguson voicing Han Solo (whom he previously voiced in \"Robot Chicken\" and \"Mad\").\n\nShaquille O'Neal voices a Lego version of himself who is a Master Builder alongside two generic members of the 2002 NBA All-Stars.\n\nWill Forte, Dave Franco, Jake Johnson, Keegan-Michael Key, Chris McKay and Jorma Taccone provide voice cameos in the film.\n\nCo-director Christopher Miller cameos as a TV presenter in the studio that films the \"Where Are My Pants?\" TV series.\n\nDan Lin conceived of the idea for the film and began discussing it with Roy Lee before leaving Warner Bros. to form his own production company, Lin Pictures, in 2008. Meanwhile, Warner Bros. home entertainment executive Kevin Tsujihara had recognized the value of the Lego franchise by engineering the studio's purchase of Lego video game licensee Traveller's Tales in 2007, thought the success of the Lego-based video games indicated a Lego-based film was a good idea, and reportedly \"championed\" the development of the film. By August 2009, Dan and Kevin Hageman were writing the script described as \"action adventure set in a Lego world.\" \"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs\" directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller were in talks in June 2010 to write and direct the film. Warner Bros. green-lit the film by November 2011, with a planned 2014 release date. The Australian studio Animal Logic was contracted to provide the animation, which was expected to comprise 80% of the film. By this time Chris McKay, the director of \"Robot Chicken\", had also joined Lord and Miller to co-direct. McKay explained that his role was to supervise the production in Australia once Lord and Miller left to work on \"22 Jump Street\". In March 2012, Lord and Miller revealed the film's working title, \"Lego: The Piece of Resistance\", and a storyline. In April 2012, Warner Bros. scheduled the film for release on February 28, 2014, a date that subsequently changed.\n\nBy June 2012, Chris Pratt had been cast as the voice of Emmet, the lead Lego character, and Will Arnett voicing Lego Batman; the role of Lego Superman was offered to Channing Tatum. By August 2012, Elizabeth Banks was hired to voice Lucy (later getting the alias \"Wyldstyle\") and Morgan Freeman to voice Vitruvius, an old mystic. In October 2012, Warner Bros. shifted the release date for the film, simply titled \"Lego\", to February 7, 2014. In November 2012, Alison Brie, Will Ferrell, Liam Neeson, and Nick Offerman signed on for roles. Brie voices Unikitty, a member of Emmet's team; Ferrell voices the antagonist President/Lord Business; Neeson voices Bad Cop/Good Cop and Offerman voices MetalBeard, a pirate seeking revenge on Business.\n\nIn July 2012, a Lego-user contest announced on the film's Facebook page would choose a winning Lego vehicle to appear in the film. Miller's childhood Space Village playset is utilized in the film.\n\nThe film is strongly inspired by the visual aesthetic and stylistics of Brickfilms and received a great deal of praise in the respective online communities who saw the film as appraising nod to their work. Many Brickfilm-Fans and AFOL’s (Adult Fans of Lego) praised the painstaking amount of detail in the production. Animal Logic tried to make the film's animation replicate a stop motion film even if everything was done through computer graphics, with the animation rigs following the same articulation limits actual Lego figures have. The camera systems also tried to replicate live action cinematography, including different lenses and a Steadicam simulator. The scenery was projected through The Lego Group's own Lego Digital Designer, which as CG supervisor Aidan Sarsfield detailed, \"uses the official LEGO Brick Library and effectively simulates the connectivity of each of the bricks.\" The saved files were then converted to design and animate in Maya and XSI. At times the minifigures were even placed under microscopes to capture the seam lines, dirt and grime into the digital textures. Benny the spaceman was based on the line of Lego space sets sold in the 1980s, and his design includes the broken helmet chin strap, a common defect of the space sets at that time.\n\nThe film's total cost, including production, promotion and advertising (P&A), was $100 million. Half of the film's cost was financed by Village Roadshow Pictures. The rest was covered by Warner Bros., with RatPac-Dune Entertainment providing a smaller share as part of its multi-year financing agreement with Warner Bros. Initially Warner Bros. turned down Village Roadshow Pictures when it asked to invest in the film. However, Warner Bros. later changed its mind, reportedly due to lack of confidence in the film, initially offering Village Roadshow Pictures the opportunity to finance 25% of the film, and later, an additional 25%.\n\nThe film's original score was composed by Mark Mothersbaugh, who had previously worked with Lord and Miller on \"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs\" and \"21 Jump Street\". \"The Lego Movie\" soundtrack contains the score as the majority of its tracks. Also included is the song \"Everything Is Awesome!!!\" written by Shawn Patterson (\"\" and \"Robot Chicken\"), Joshua Bartholomew, and Lisa Harriton, who also perform the song in the movie under the name, Jo Li. The single, released on January 27, 2014, is performed by Tegan and Sara featuring The Lonely Island (Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer, and Jorma Taccone) who wrote the rap lyrics, and is the first song played in the end credits of the movie. The soundtrack was released on February 4, 2014 by WaterTower Music.\n\n\nThe film's theme song, \"Everything is Awesome!!!\", has been critically praised and has undergone some close analysis. Eric Brown, writing in the \"International Business Times\", describes the song as a parody of fascism, saying that the song \"seems little more than an infectiously catchy parody of watered-down radio pop, right down to the faux-dubstep breakdown. There's a lot more happening under the surface, however.\"\n\nIn an interview with Fox News, producer Mark Mothersbaugh says the song \"was supposed to be like mind control early in the film. It's totally irritating, this kind of mindless mantra to get people up and working. It's like the whip crack on their back, but then by the end of the movie it morphs into, instead of being just a mindless, go-to-work song it becomes about co-operation and people working together to do bigger things.\"\n\n\"The Lego Movie\" premiered at the Regency Village Theatre in Los Angeles, California on February 1, 2014, and was released in theaters on February 7, 2014. The film was released in Australia by the film's co-producer, Roadshow Films.\n\nOver twenty Lego sets inspired by scenes from the film were released for the film including a set of Collectible Minifigures. A website was opened up so fans could make minifigure versions of themselves, and later, put that in the film's official trailer. The company recruited a roster of global partners to a broad, multi-category licensing program to support the film. Official Lego Brand Stores also scheduled events. Each week of January 2014, a new character poster (Wyldstyle, Batman, Emmet, Lord Business) came with every purchase. By building a creative model in-store, people received a free accessory pack. Barnes & Noble hosted a themed event in January, February, and March. On February 7, 2014, McDonald's released eight collectible holographic/3D cups in Happy Meals to promote the film. A video game based on the film, \"The Lego Movie Videogame\", by TT Fusion for Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Wii U, Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation Vita, and Windows, was released on February 4, 2014. An exclusive \"Wild West Emmet\" minifigure was released with preorders of the game at GameStop.\n\n\"The Lego Movie\" was released on Digital HD on May 20, 2014. It was released by Warner Home Video on DVD and Blu-ray (2D and 3D) on June 17, 2014. A special Blu-ray 3D \"Everything is Awesome Edition\" also includes an exclusive Vitruvius minifigure and a collectible 3D Emmett photo. The film was released on 4K UHD Blu-Ray on March 1, 2016.\n\n\"The Lego Movie\" was met with \"nearly unanimous positive reviews.\" Review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 96% approval rating and an average rating of 8.2/10 based on 236 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"Boasting beautiful animation, a charming voice cast, laugh-a-minute gags, and a surprisingly thoughtful story, \"The Lego Movie\" is colorful fun for all ages.\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 based on reviews from critics, the film has a score of 83 (indicating \"universal acclaim\") based on 43 reviews. According to CinemaScore polls conducted during the opening weekend, the average grade moviegoers gave \"The Lego Movie\" was A on an A+ to F scale. Filmmaker Edgar Wright, and \"TIME\" Magazine film critic Richard Corliss, each named \"The Lego Movie\" as one of their favorite films of 2014.\n\nMichael Rechtshaffen of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" wrote, \"Arriving at a time when feature animation was looking and feeling mighty anemic…\"The LEGO Movie\" shows 'em how it's done,\" with Peter Debruge of \"Variety\" adding that Lord and Miller \"irreverently deconstruct the state of the modern blockbuster and deliver a smarter, more satisfying experience in its place, emerging with a fresh franchise for others to build upon.\" Tom Huddleston of \"Time Out\" said, \"The script is witty, the satire surprisingly pointed, and the animation tactile and imaginative.\" Drew Hunt of the \"Chicago Reader\" said the filmmakers \"fill the script with delightfully absurd one-liners and sharp pop culture references\", with A. O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" noting that, \"Pop-culture jokes ricochet off the heads of younger viewers to tickle the world-weary adults in the audience, with just enough sentimental goo applied at the end to unite the generations. Parents will dab their eyes while the kids roll theirs.\" Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York \"Daily News\" said the filmmakers \"don't sink into cynicism. Their computer animation embraces the retro look and feel of the toys to both ingenious and adorable effect.\"\n\nClaudia Puig of \"USA Today\" called the film \"a spirited romp through a world that looks distinctively familiar, and yet freshly inventive.\" Liam Lacey of \"The Globe and Mail\" asked, \"Can a feature-length toy commercial also work as a decent kids’ movie? The bombast of the \"G.I. Joe\" and \"Transformers\" franchises might suggest no, but after an uninspired year for animated movies, \"The Lego Movie\" is a 3-D animated film that connects.\" Joel Arnold of NPR acknowledged that the film \"may be one giant advertisement, but all the way to its plastic-mat foundation, it's an earnest piece of work—a cash grab with a heart.\" Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" called the film \"sassy enough to shoot well-aimed darts at corporate branding.\" Michael O'Sullivan of \"The Washington Post\" said that, \"While clearly filled with affection for—and marketing tie-ins to—the titular product that's front and center, it's also something of a sharp plastic brick flung in the eye of its corporate sponsor.\"\n\nOn the negative side, Kyle Smith of the \"New York Post\" called the film \"more exhausting than fun, too unsure of itself to stick with any story thread for too long.\" Moira MacDonald of \"The Seattle Times\", while generally positive, found \"it falls apart a bit near the end.\" Alonso Duralde of \"The Wrap\" said the film \"will doubtless tickle young fans of the toys. It's just too bad that a movie that encourages you to think for yourself doesn't follow its own advice.\"\n\nTelevision personality, author, filmmaker, radio host and conservative political commentator Glenn Beck praised the film for avoiding \"the double meanings and adult humor I just hate.\"\n\nOscar host Neil Patrick Harris referenced \"The Lego Movie\" not being nominated Best Animated Feature, which many critics considered a major snub, saying prior to the award's presentation \"If you’re at the Oscar party with the guys who directed 'The Lego Movie,' now would be a great time to distract them.\"\n\nU.S. Senator Ron Johnson criticized the film's anti-corporate message, saying that it taught children that \"government is good and business is bad\", citing the villain's name of Lord Business. \"That's done for a reason\", Johnson told WisPolitics.com. \"They're starting that propaganda, and it's insidious\". The comments were criticized by many, and Russ Feingold brought up the comments on the campaign trail during his 2016 Senate bid against Johnson.\n\n\"The Lego Movie\" grossed $257.8 million in the U.S. and Canada, and $210.3 million internationally, for a worldwide total of $469.1 million. Calculating in all expenses, \"Deadline Hollywood\" estimated that the film made a profit of $229 million.\n\nIn the U.S. and Canada, the film opened at number one in its first weekend with over $69 million, which was the second-highest weekend debut in February, at the time, behind \"The Passion of the Christ\" ($83.8 million). The movie retained the top spot at box office in its second weekend by declining only 28% and grossing $49.8 million. \"The Lego Movie\" was number one again in its third weekend while declining 37% and grossing $31.3 million. In its fourth weekend, the film dropped to number three grossing $20.8 million.\n\nElsewhere, \"The Lego Movie\" was released in 34 markets in February 7, 2014—the same weekend as its U.S. release. It made $18.7 million on its opening weekend from 5,695 screens from 34 countries. On its opening weekend, which varies depending on the country, it earned $3.8 million in Mexico, $2 million in Spain, and $1.8 million in Brazil. With a total gross of £34.3 million, it was the second-highest-grossing film in the UK and Ireland in 2014.\n\nThe popularity of the film led to a shortage of Lego products by September 2014.\n\nBecause of its critical and commercial success, \"The Lego Movie\" has been turned into a franchise and a shared fictional universe, it consists of:\n\nA direct sequel to the film, entitled \"\", is scheduled for release on February 8, 2019 with Chris Pratt, Elizabeth Banks and Will Arnett reprising their roles of Emmet, Wyldstyle and Batman respectively and Tiffany Haddish joining the cast.\n\nThere are two spin-off films, the first two of which, \"The Lego Batman Movie\" and \"The Lego Ninjago Movie\", were both released in 2017.

It was first published in the book \"Moral Tales for Formal Children\" in 1854 by the Colombian poet[Rafael Pombo. Due to the importance and impact of this play in Latin American children Latin American literature of the nineteenth century, \"The Poor Old Lady\" became one of the most memorable characters in the Colombian and Latin American childhood. This paradoxical but amusing story is still reprinted in compilations of children stories and nursery rhymes.\n\n\"The Poor Old Lady\" tells the story of a rich old lady who has everything (clothes, goods, food.). However, in each verse of the story she is described as someone who complains about having nothing. At the end, the poor old lady dies from all the alleged complications which she had. In an ironic way the story ends with a particular phrase: “God grant that we can enjoy the poverty of that poor lady and die from the same ill.”\n\nThe story revolves around a unique character, the poor old lady, which is based on a commonly known social stereotype.\n\nLike all tales and rhymes of Rafael Pombo, \"The Poor Old Lady\" teaches children about everyday aspects of human beings and society. Women and their insatiable desire to have many shoes and dresses, and in a deeper layer this story deals with a main aspect: the human greed and exposes that material things are not the most important stuff in life.\n\nThe poor old lady explores 2 very basic human ensigns:\n\n\nNegative or positive ensigns?\nFor many she was just a greedy lady that never noticed what she had was more than what many others had.\nBut we could imagine also that an old lady like her probably would have tried along her life all kind of drinks, and meals and shoes and beds and seats, which would have made of her a truly curious and exploratory person, perhaps insatiable.\n\nThe poor old lady is one of the most recognized characters of the Colombian culture, and is commonly used in elementary school textbooks, nursery rhymes, and child literature compilations.\n\nIn 1977, Fernando Laverde performed the animated film version of this story, which is considered the first animated film created in Colombia.\n\nRepresentations of the character are used in parades and carnivals. In recent years, the theme parks Mundo Aventura and Colombian National Coffee Park have used animatronics versions of \"The Poor Old Lady\".\n"}

The course was given in 1997 and 1998. The goal of the curriculum innovations was to transform a large lecture course into a learning community. Professors: Larry Friedlander (English), Haun Saussy (East Asian Studies), and Tim Lenior (History); teaching fellows: Carlos Seligo and Margo Denman and lab staff: Charles Kerns and George Toye worked together to develop a holistic curriculum mediated through a website center for the course.\n\nThis course was developed in response to the shortcomings of earlier large lecture courses. This type of course typically rated poorly in student evaluations and often led students to behaviors that inhibited learning: students skipped lectures and did not read assignments or prepare for meetings; students crammed for exams and waited until the last minute to write papers with a focus on grades and not learning. They were passive participants in a system that did not foster active engagement. Often there was a lack of continuity between lecture and section. Students had widely varying levels of knowledge about the texts. Faculty had very little information about the students’ knowledge as the course proceeded and the students had little feedback on their performance.\n\nThe curriculum was based on the reading of five texts, Genesis, Blade Runner, Hamlet, Descartes' Meditations, from the viewpoint of the scholar of history, literature, or philosophy. The course emphasized methods of reading and critical and interpretive approaches, rather than content.\nThis first year course met weekly in two one-hour lectures for all 100 students and two one-hour discussion section meetings of 15 students each. Students and instructors engaged in web activities including structured reading assignments and asynchronous discussion forums. The web site provided rich resources to supplement the texts. Students worked cross-section group projects and on panel discussions. There was no final exam for the course; a fair was held in which students exhibited their project web sites.\n\nA site that had a calendar, announcements, faculty bios, the asynchronous discussion forums, assignments, and student projects\nThe course web site linked rich resources supporting each text to engage students from novices to those well-informed on the texts. It included explanatory information, annotations, cultural information, critical analyses, visual interpretations of the texts including paintings, video recordings of multiple performances, and different cuts of the films.\nThe web site also had a series of on-line assignments that structured the learners’ reading activities. These on-line activities drew upon the students’ previous knowledge and guided them as they approached each text. In the first year of the project in 1997 students responses were recorded in a personal on-line, shareable portfolio, but after noting little use of the portfolio, the design was changed in the second iteration of the course in 1998 so that assignments were displayed directly in the discussion Forum.\n\nThe Forum had special features to support large lecture courses such as photographs of the posting student next to his/her message, organization into sections, and notification systems to alert faculty and groups to special postings. The forum was used to discuss lectures; it was where assignments were posted (they were not sent to an instructor); and was used for communication in forming project groups.The Forum was enhanced in the second year to allow direct linkage to assignments, faculty-controlled subject organization, and threaded discussion.\n\nThe students in the course completed projects in the second half of the course that demonstrated their understanding of the texts. Projects were constructed in many media the first year but were limited to posters and web sites in the second. Faculty met often with students helping them to plan their projects.

We take public affairs to comprise the parliamentary and legislative process, administrative regulations, the rendering of justice, all quasi-judicial activities, and the overall day-to-day administration.”\n\nThis article lists key events in the evolution of language policy in Canada since 1710, when the French-speaking population of Acadia first came under British administration. The timeline covers the policies of the colonial predecessors to the current Canadian state, and the policies of Canada's provinces and territories. The policies listed include:\n\nThese policy changes have been important to the extent that they affected the lives of individual Canadians. Therefore, in order to give some idea of the relative importance of various policies over the centuries, population statistics for Canada’s different language groups are included where such information is available.\n\nOfficial languages policies, in one form or another, have been in existence since the beginning of the European colonization of North America. In the early years, French was the sole language used in France's North American colonial possessions, English had been the sole language of Britain's colonies in the New World. The First Nations continued to use their indigenous languages in their own affairs. There were a limited number of people who knew both a European and a native North American language, often Christian missionaries the “black robes” and the children of natives they ministered to. These bilinguals were called on in diplomacy, but otherwise the linguistic worlds of the settlers and the natives were largely separate. Without being fluent, natives and settlers often learned very rudimentary forms of each other’s languages called “pidgins”. Pidgins, such as the Algonquian–Basque pidgin, Labrador Inuit Pidgin French, American Indian Pidgin English, and Pidgin Delaware were initially important languages of trade and diplomacy, but none of them was ever prestigious enough to be used in any other governmental context.\n\nThe need for a considered language policy came with the absorption New France into the British Empire. This began with the British occupation of Acadia in 1710 followed by the conquest of Canada in 1759. Britain was then ruling over a large population of non-English speaking white settlers. \nIn what is now the eastern half of the country, some sort of accommodation was made for French during the long period of British colonial rule that followed, but at no point did the language achieve full legal and practical equality with English. The public reaction to this situation was one of the sources of the political instability that led to the adoption of a series of constitutions, culminating in the adoption of a federal structure in 1867 as a way of allowing the two languages to have different levels of official status in different provinces.\n\nFollowing Confederation in 1867, French and English were treated as being fully equal within Quebec, in all matters under provincial jurisdiction. In matters under federal jurisdiction, English occupied a \"de facto\" privileged position, and French was not fully equal, although it did enjoy some constitutionally protected privileges. In other provinces, French was sometimes tolerated and sometimes actively suppressed. Other settler languages, such as Scottish Gaelic, Irish, and German were ignored in politics and increasingly suppressed with adoption of universal public education.\n\nAboriginal languages, which earlier Christian missionaries had studied and helped to document, came under sustained attack by a system of state-sponsored church-run residential schools beginning in the 1840s in the east and later extending across the country. These schools were part of a deliberate policy to suppress or eliminate indigenous languages in favour of English.\nOver the course of the Twentieth and early Twenty-first centuries, the two predominant settler languages, English and French, have gradually achieved a greater level of equality in most of Canada's provinces, and full equality at the federal level. The trend has been very different in Quebec, however, where in the 1970s English was formally deprived of its status of full legal equality. Today, French is, both \"de facto\" and \"de jure\", the sole official language of Quebec.\n\nAlso since the 1960s and the adoption of the policy of Official multiculturalism in Canada, teaching of other languages besides English and French, not only as a separate subject but as the medium of instruction, has expanded dramatically, beginning primarily with European languages, notably Ukrainian, the policy changes at the provincial level have seen a boom in schools catering to a variety of language groups. For example, in Edmonton, Alberta in 2015 the Catholic school board offered full immersion in French, \"bilingual programs\" (one third to one half time immersion) in Polish, Spanish, and Ukrainian, and part-time language and culture programs in Filipino, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, and Nehiyaw Pimatisiwin (Cree). Likewise, the public school board offered American Sign Language Bilingual, Arabic Bilingual, Chinese (Mandarin) Bilingual, French Immersion, Late French Immersion, German Bilingual, Hebrew Bilingual, International Spanish Academy, Ukrainian International Bilingual, and Awasis (Cree) programs.\n\n\n\n\"For events prior to the creation of the province 1905, see Northwest Territories\"\n\n\n\n\n\"For events prior to the creation of the colony in 1784, see Nova Scotia\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For events prior to the creation of the Province of Upper Canada in 1791, see Quebec\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For events prior to the creation of the province 1905, see Northwest Territories\"\n\n\n\"For events prior to the creation of the territory in 1898, see Northwest Territories\"\n\n\n"}

Written by co-creators Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, it was first broadcast on ATV Midlands on 30 September 1965. The plot revolves around criminal mastermind the Hood, who sabotages the nuclear-powered airliner \"Fireflash\" prior to her maiden flight. Unable to land for fear of detonating a motion-sensitive bomb, and threatened by radiation leaking from \"Fireflash\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s overworked atomic reactor, the crew and passengers' only hope of survival is the newly formed International Rescue Organisation.\n\nWhile drafting the episode, the Andersons found inspiration in Gerry's experiences as a conscript in the RAF during the 1940s, when he witnessed the fatal crash of a Mosquito fighter and the controlled landing of a damaged Spitfire. Filmed mostly in late 1964, \"Trapped in the Sky\" features pioneering work from series special effects director Derek Meddings, who used a looping \"rolling road\" mechanism to simplify the shooting of the \"Fireflash\" rescue.\n\nLew Grade, head of distributor ITC, was so pleased with the 25-minute pilot that he instructed the production staff to double the standard episode running length to fill a one-hour commercial timeslot. This necessitated the writing of scenes and subplots.\n\nWell received on its first broadcast, \"Trapped in the Sky\" remains critically acclaimed and is generally considered to be one of the best episodes of the series. It was adapted for audio by Century 21 Records in 1966, transmitted on BBC Radio in revised form in 1990, and had its first TV network broadcast on BBC Two in 1991. In 2015, \"Trapped in the Sky\" was remade as \"Fireflash\", the fifth episode of the CGI reboot \"Thunderbirds Are Go\".\n\nCriminal mastermind the Hood (voiced by Ray Barrett) is telepathically linked to his half-brother, Kyrano (David Graham), the manservant on Tracy Island. Abusing this connection and inflicting severe psychological trauma on his sibling, he discovers that International Rescue – the Tracy family's newly formed life-saving organisation – is ready to start operations. Determined to steal the secrets of IR's \"Thunderbird\" machines, the Hood plots to have the Tracys called to a disaster situation of his own design. Travelling from his temple hideout in the Malaysian jungle to London International Airport, he plants a bomb next to the landing gear hydraulics of Air Terrainean's new \"Fireflash\" – an atomic-powered, hypersonic airliner departing for her maiden flight to Tokyo. One of the passengers is Kyrano's daughter, Tin-Tin. In an anonymous videophone call to London Tower, the Hood warns Commander Norman of Air Traffic Control that the motion-sensitive device will detonate from the impact of landing.\n\n\"Fireflash\" is recalled and Captain Hanson and his co-pilot instructed to circle the airspace above the airport. The shielding on the airliner's atomic reactor is weakening; if \"Fireflash\" does not land within two hours, the passengers and crew will die of radiation exposure. Air Traffic Control commandeers an Air Force jet that docks with \"Fireflash\" in flight, allowing a Lieutenant Bob Meddings to board the hold and attempt to remove the bomb. Meddings is almost killed when he falls through the unclosed maintenance hatch and plummets to the ground; moments before impact, however, he successfully deploys his parachute and ultimately survives.\n\nIR's John Tracy (Barrett), who has been monitoring radio traffic from the space station \"Thunderbird 5\", relays news of the unfolding events to Tracy Island. Jeff (Peter Dyneley) immediately dispatches Scott (Shane Rimmer) and Virgil (David Holliday) in \"Thunderbirds 1\" and \"2\" – the latter carrying Pod 3 – to London. Arriving at the danger zone, Scott assures Norman of IR's good intentions, in return demanding his word that no photographs will be taken of either aircraft. However, the Hood, disguised as one of the airport police detachment, breaks into the unmanned \"Thunderbird 1\" and photographs the cockpit. Scott is alerted by the Automatic Camera Detector and the Hood flees, chased along the M1 motorway by the police.\n\nArriving in \"Thunderbird 2\", Virgil deploys three Elevator Cars, two of which will be remote-controlled from his master vehicle. \"Fireflash\" will be guided into a controlled landing on top of the cars, touching down with its undercarriage raised. Virgil and the Elevator Cars rush to intercept \"Fireflash\" as it speeds down Runway 29, but when one of the remote-controlled cars malfunctions and crashes into parked aircraft, the rescue attempt is aborted and the operation suspended while Virgil activates a reserve car. \"Fireflash\" starts a second run and successfully makes contact with all three vehicles. Applying brakes, Virgil loses control of the master car, which crashes into a trench; he is uninjured, however, and \"Fireflash\" comes to a halt before reaching the end of the runway. The bomb is dislodged from its original position but ultimately fails to explode.\n\nAs the Hood has managed to evade the authorities, Scott leaves him to IR's London agent, Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward (Sylvia Anderson). Chasing the enemy in their specially-modified Rolls-Royce, FAB 1, Penelope and her butler, Parker (Graham), blast him off the motorway using the car's front-mounted machine gun. Although the Hood survives the encounter, his photographs are destroyed.\n\nBack on Tracy Island, Jeff implements \"Operation Cover-Up\" to hide the existence of IR while Kyrano is examined by a doctor from the mainland, who dismisses the manservant's prior nausea as a sign of stress. When the topic of the conversation shifts to the \"Fireflash\" incident, the doctor declares that he would be honoured to shake IR by the hand. With a parting handshake, Jeff grants the unknowing guest his wish, before announcing to his sons, \"Boys, I think we're in business.\"\n\nInspiration for the plot of \"Trapped in the Sky\" was derived from creator-producer Gerry Anderson's memories of his National Service. While stationed at RAF Manston in Kent from 1947 to 1949, the young Anderson had witnessed a Battle of Britain-themed air show coming to a fateful end: a Mosquito fighter had gone out of control and crashed to the ground, resulting in 20 fatalities. A few months after the Mosquito disaster, he saw a Spitfire with a damaged undercarriage make a successful emergency landing at the airbase. During the pre-production of \"Thunderbirds\", Anderson used his recollections of the events as the foundation of the bomb plot surrounding the \"Fireflash\" airliner. Anderson dictated the script to his wife, Sylvia, for typing at their villa in Portugal; it was completed in four sessions during the spring of 1964. As an in-joke, the character of Lieutenant Bob Meddings is named after Bob Bell, the AP Films art director, and Derek Meddings, the director of special effects.\n\nFilming on the pilot episode of \"Thunderbirds\" commenced in the late summer of 1964 after five months of pre-production. Between the scripting and filming stages, the name of the new TV series had been finalised, \"Thunderbirds\" having initially been titled \"International Rescue\"; additionally, the fleet of star vehicles had originally been named the \"Rescues\". Although there is no on-screen title caption, the episode is referred to in all internal production documentation by the name \"Trapped in the Sky\".\n\nWhile preparing to film the \"Fireflash\" controlled landing sequence, Meddings was faced with the difficulty of having to build an extended, dynamic runway set in the limited shooting space available at AP Films Studios. His compact and cost-efficient solution was to isolate the basic set elements – the grass verge foreground, the sky background and the tarmac separating them – and construct separate loops of canvas, all painted to represent one element; these were fitted to rollers that, when run at speeds proportionate to their respective distances from the camera, simulated a continuous backdrop. This \"rolling road\" (or \"roller-road\") technique marked a progression from the \"rolling sky\" that had been pioneered in previous Anderson series, such as \"Stingray\".\n\nThe crash of the left-side remote-controlled Elevator Car was originally a gaffe, caused when the wire pulling the scale model across the \"rolling road\" unexpectedly snapped. So satisfied was Meddings with the realism of the shot that he asked the Andersons to re-write their script to accommodate the error. This was later supplemented with new footage of the rogue Elevator Car colliding with a parked aircraft, starting a fire on the tarmac; in the episode, the stationary vehicles are left to burn since, as stated by Commander Norman, \"\"Fireflash\" is carrying passengers – they're not!\"\n\nDuring the Tracy Island briefing scene, Alan Tracy's voice is audibly lower and deeper than in later episodes. Since voice actor Matt Zimmerman had yet to be added to the regular cast at the time of dialogue recording, Ray Barrett (who voiced John and the Hood) supplied the character's single line (\"OK, father\"). Despite his absence, Zimmerman is listed in the closing credits of \"Trapped in the Sky\". A second continuity error occurs during the concluding scene. When Jeff initiates the \"Operation Cover-up\" security protocol to erase all sign of International Rescue's presence for purposes of the doctor's visit, the portraits on the wall change from photographs of the Tracy brothers in uniform to a different set in which civilian attire is worn; however, in a subsequent shot, the edge of a blue uniform is still visible.\n\nBarry Gray's arrangements for the episode's opening and closing theme music – based on the signature \"The \"Thunderbirds\" March\", which accompanies the stock launch sequences of \"Thunderbirds 1\", \"2\" and \"3\" – are unique to \"Trapped in the Sky\". As an end theme, \"The \"Thunderbirds\" March\" was a last-minute substitute for \"Flying High\"; this was a lyrical track, sung by Gary Miller, which was conceived to serve as a counterpoint to the instrumental opening music. It was judged by Anderson and Gray to be tonally unsuitable and was replaced two weeks before the first broadcast of \"Trapped in the Sky\" in September 1965. Gray recorded the incidental music in December 1964, at the Olympic Studios at Barnes, London, with an orchestra of 30 instrumentalists.\n\n\"Thunderbirds\" was originally due to have a 25-minute episode running time; this was doubled at the instruction of Lew Grade, Anderson's financial backer at distributor ITC, after a preview screening of \"Trapped in the Sky\". Praising the plot and special effects, Grade commented, \"That's not a television series, that's a feature film!\" With the budget per episode also increased from £25,000 to £38,000, the pilot and eight other unfinished episodes were extended and re-edited to run for 50 minutes (filling a one-hour commercial timeslot). In the case of \"Trapped in the Sky\", new footage was filmed during the shooting of \"Operation Crash-Dive\", which features the return of \"Fireflash\" and was written as a sequel to the first episode. Among the newly added scenes were the subplot concerning Meddings' boarding of \"Fireflash\", as well as the first rescue attempt involving the Elevator Cars.\n\n\"Trapped in the Sky\" was first broadcast on ATV Midlands at 7:00 p.m. on 30 September 1965. An alternative, two-part format debuted on 20 October for the episode's Granada Television première. The episode was networked nationwide for the first time on 20 September 1991, after BBC Two acquired the broadcast rights to the series; it achieved ratings of 6.8 million viewers when it was repeated by the channel in 1992. On 18 December 1994, \"Trapped in the Sky\" was transmitted in a re-edited format as the first episode of \"Turbocharged Thunderbirds\"; broadcast on UPN in the United States, the programme combined footage drawn from the 1960s series with new, live-action scenes. The episode was broadcast in surround sound for the first time on BBC Two on 3 September 2000.\n\nAdditionally, the episode has re-appeared several times in condensed audio form. The first adaptation, with narration from Shane Rimmer (in character as Scott), was originally released as the mini-album \"Thunderbird 1\" (MA 108) in April 1966 by Century 21 Records. With an introduction by Gerry Anderson and additional narration by Rimmer, \"Thunderbird 1\" was broadcast on BBC Radio 5 as the first episode of a radio series in November 1990. Most recently, \"Trapped in the Sky\" was adapted for Penguin Audiobooks.\n\n\"Trapped in the Sky\" received a positive, contemporary critical response from L. Marsland Gander of \"The Daily Telegraph\", who commented, \"It is a show that has to be seen to be disbelieved.\" Writing for the same newspaper in 2011, Simon Heffer remembered his enthusiastic impressions of watching \"Trapped in the Sky\" as a boy in 1965, and how it endeared him to the rest of the series: \" ... I had just watched the first episode of \"Thunderbirds\". I felt as though the whole landscape of what passes for my imagination had been changed ... It caused an excitement of the sort that is possible only for the very young, and it lasted for days. Indeed, every Saturday night was a renewal of the miracle.\" Co-creator Sylvia Anderson observes that, by necessity, the pilot episode comprises many examples of exposition for the purposes of introducing the primary characters and vehicles. However, she considers the roles of Lady Penelope and Parker to be \"brief but effective\".\n\nThe episode was listed as a series highlight in issue 61 of \"Cult Times\", published in 2000; writer Mike Fillis referred to \"Trapped in the Sky\" as \"riveting\", and its bomb plot premise as \"very topical\". A BBC retrospective praises aspects of the episode's futuristic design, describing \"Fireflash\" as a \"beautifully-envisioned, Concorde-like craft\", and London Airport's Air Terrainean lounge, where the character of Tin-Tin is first seen, as \"like a set from a Dean Martin movie\". Model-maker Martin Bower, who contributed to the special effects of the Andersons' later series, \"\", comments positively on the \"realistic\" design of the Elevator Cars, writing that they are \"to me, among the most memorable of vehicles\".\n\nIn 2004, \"Trapped in the Sky\" was re-issued on Region 1 DVD as part of A&E Video's release \"The Best of Thunderbirds: The Favorite Episodes\", whose content was selected based on the results of a fan poll hosted on the A&E website. Reviewing the product for DVD Verdict, David Gutierrez awarded \"Trapped in the Sky\" a grade of 95 (out of 100), commending the episode for the rescue itself (considered \"amazing\") and adding: \"Television rarely has moments as exciting as the \"Fireflash\" attempting a forced landing.\" Stuart Galbraith IV of the DVD Talk website characterised the plot as \"sort of an airborne version of \"Speed\"\". In a BBC Online review of the 2003 \"Thunderbirds\" soundtrack album, Morag Reavley commented positively on composer Barry Gray's incidental piece \"\"Fireflash\" Landing\", stating that it is one of several \"catchy, pulse-quickening tunes\" that \"come fast and furious\".\n\nVincent Law of the \"Andersonic\" website argues that the episode's status as series pilot is not detrimental to the writing of the plot, which employs a theme – suggested to be common to many Anderson-produced series – of \"advanced technology, upon which the characters are reliant, going awry.\" Among Law's criticisms is the characterisation, which is considered, at times, to test the limits of credibility; one example offered is the lack of emotional response from Tin-Tin to the precarious position of the sabotaged \"Fireflash\". On the subject of dialogue, he gives a summary of \"limp and routine at times – lots of 'left left, two degrees' – and overall much less witty than \"Stingray\".\" Law concludes that \"Trapped in the Sky\" overall is \"a great opener, arguably the best episode of the series.\"\n\nDr Phillip Atcliffe, an aerospace engineering lecturer at the University of Salford, has praised \"Trapped in the Sky\" for its depiction of commercial hypersonic flight. While discussing on the development of the Lockheed Martin SR-72 reconnaissance plane in 2013, Atcliffe made reference to the episode and commented that the time necessary for the fictional \"Fireflash\" to fly from London to Tokyo (two hours at a reported Mach 6) would be \"surprisingly accurate\" in reality. He also expressed the view that the altitude at which \"Fireflash\" is stated to be travelling – – would be optimal for a passenger aircraft travelling at hypersonic speeds.\n\n\"Trapped in the Sky\" was remade as \"Fireflash\", the fifth episode of \"Thunderbirds Are Go\". Recycled plot elements include the character of Captain Hanson and the rescue involving the Elevator Cars. \"Fireflash\" was first broadcast on 25 April 2015.\n\nFootnotes\nBibliography\n\n"}
{"id": "10886610", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10886610", "title": "Trivialism", "text": "Trivialism\n\nTrivialism () is the logical theory that all statements (also known as propositions) are true and that all contradictions of the form \"p and not p\" (e.g. the ball is red and not red) are true. In accordance with this, a trivialist is a person who believes everything is true.\n\nIn classical logic, trivialism is in direct violation of Aristotle's law of noncontradiction. In philosophy, trivialism is considered by some to be the complete opposite of skepticism. Paraconsistent logics may use \"the law of non-triviality\" to abstain from trivialism in logical practices that involve true contradictions.\n\nTheoretical arguments and anecdotes have been offered for trivialism to contrast it with theories such as modal realism, dialetheism and paraconsistent logics.\n\nTrivialism, as a term, is derived from the Latin word \"trivialis,\" meaning something that can be found everywhere. From this, \"trivial\" was used to suggest something was introductory or simple. In logic, from this meaning, a \"trivial\" theory is something regarded as defective in the face of a complex phenomenon that needs to be completely represented. Thus, literally, the trivialist theory is something expressed in the simplest possible way.\n\nIn symbolic logic, trivialism may be expressed as the following:\n\nThe above would be read as \"given any proposition, it is a true proposition\" through universal quantification (∀).\n\nA claim of trivialism may always apply its fundamental truth, otherwise known as a truth predicate:\n\nThe above would be read as a \"proposition if and only if a true proposition,\" meaning that all propositions are believed to be inherently proven as true. Without consistent use of this concept, a claim of advocating trivialism may not be seen as genuine and complete trivialism; as to claim a proposition is true but deny it as probably true may be considered inconsistent with the assumed theory.\n\nLuis Estrada-González in \"Models of Possiblism and Trivialism\" lists four types of trivialism through the concept of possible worlds, with a \"world\" being a possibility and \"the actual world\" being reality. It is theorized a trivialist simply designates a value to all propositions in equivalence to seeing all propositions and their negations as true. This taxonomy is used to demonstrate the different strengths and plausibility of trivialism in this context:\n\nThe consensus among the majority of philosophers is descriptively a denial of trivialism, termed as non-trivialism or anti-trivialism. This is due to it being unable to produce a sound argument through the principle of explosion and it being considered an absurdity (reductio ad absurdum).\n\nAristotle's law of noncontradiction and other arguments are considered to be against trivialism. Luis Estrada-González in \"Models of Possiblism and Trivialism\" has interpreted Aristotle's \"Metaphysics Book IV\" as such: \"...A family of arguments between 1008a26 and 1007b12 of the form 'If trivialism is right, then X is the case, but if X is the case then all things are one. But it is impossible that all things are one, so trivialism is impossible.'(...)these Aristotelian considerations are the seeds of virtually all subsequent suspicions against trivialism: Trivialism has to be rejected because it identifies what should not be identified, and is undesirable from a logical point of view because it identifies what is not identical, namely, truth and falsehood.\"\n\nIt is implicitly claimed by Graham Priest, a professor of philosophy, that a position for trivialism is unsubstantial: \"...a substantial case can be made for [dialetheism]; belief in [trivialism], though, would appear to be grounds for certifiable insanity.\"\n\nHe has coined his rejection of trivialism \"the law of non-triviality\" as a replacement for the law of non-contradiction in paraconsistent logic and dialetheism.\n\nThere are theoretical arguments for trivialism argued from the position of a devil's advocate:\n\nPaul Kabay has argued for trivialism in \"On the Plenitude of Truth\" from the following:\n\n\nAbove, possibilism (modal realism; related to possible worlds) is the barely accepted theory that every proposition is possible. With this assumed to be true, trivialism can be assumed to be true as well according to Kabay.\n\nThe liar's paradox, Curry's paradox alongside the principle of explosion all can be asserted as valid and not required to be resolved and used to defend trivialism.\n\nIn Paul Kabay's comparison of trivialism to schools of philosophical skepticism (in \"On the Plenitude of Truth\")—such as Pyrrhonism—who seek to attain a form of ataraxia, or state of imperturbability; it is purported the figurative trivialist inherently attains this state. This is claimed to be justified by the figurative trivialist seeing every state of affairs being true, even in a state of anxiety. Once universally accepted as true, the trivialist is free from any further anxieties regarding whether any state of affairs is true.\n\nKabay compares the Pyrrhonian skeptic to the figurative trivialist and claims that as the skeptic reportedly attains a state of imperturbability through a suspension of belief, the trivialist may attain such a state through an abundance of belief.\n\nIn this case—and according to independent claims by Graham Priest—trivialism is considered the complete opposite of skepticism. However, insofar as the trivialist affirms all states of affairs as universally true, the Pyrrhonist neither affirms nor denies the truth (or falsity) of such affairs.\n\nIt is asserted by both Priest and Kabay that it is impossible for a trivialist to truly choose and thus act. Priest argues this by the following in \"Doubt Truth to Be a Liar\": \"One cannot intend to act in such a way as to bring about some state of affairs, \"s\", if one believes \"s\" already to hold. Conversely, if one acts with the purpose of bringing \"s\" about, one cannot believe that \"s\" already obtains.\" Ironically, due to their suspension of determination upon striking equipollence between claims, the Pyrrhonist has also remained subject to apraxia charges.\n\nPaul Kabay, an Australian philosopher, in his book \"A Defense of Trivialism\" has argued that various philosophers in history have held views resembling trivialism, although he stops short of calling them trivialists. He mentions various pre-Socratic Greek philosophers as philosophers holding views resembling trivialism. He mentions that Aristotle in his book \"Metaphysics\" appears to suggest that Heraclitus and Anaxagoras advocated trivialism. He quotes Anaxagoras as saying that all things are one. Kabay also suggests Heraclitus' ideas are similar to trivialism because Heraclitus believed in a union of opposites, shown in such quotes as \"the way up and down is the same\". Kabay also mentions a fifteen century Roman Catholic cardinal Nicholas of Cusa, stating that what Cusa wrote in \"De Docta Ignorantia\" is interpreted as stating that God contained every fact, which Kabay argues would result in trivialism, but Kabay admits that mainstream Cusa scholars would not agree with interpreting Cusa as a trivialist. Kabay also mentions Spinoza as a philosopher whose views resemble trivialism. Kabay argues Spinoza was a trivialist because Spinoza believed everything was made of one substance which had infinite attributes. Kabay also mentions Hegel as a philosophers whose views resemble trivialism, quoting Hegel as stating in \"The Science of Logic\" \"everything is inherently contradictory.\"\n\nJody Azzouni is a purported advocate of trivialism in his article \"The Strengthened Liar\" by claiming that natural language is trivial and inconsistent through the existence of the liar paradox (\"This sentence is false\"), and claiming that natural language has developed without central direction. It is heavily implied by Azzouni that every sentence in any natural language is true.\n\nThe Greek philosopher Anaxagoras is suggested as a possible trivialist by Graham Priest in his 2005 book \"Doubt Truth to Be a Liar\". Priest writes, \"He held that, at least at one time, everything was all mixed up so that no predicate applied to any one thing more than a contrary predicate.\"\n\nLuis Estrada-González in \"Models of Possiblism and Trivialism\" lists eight types of anti-trivialism (or non-trivialism) through the use of possible worlds:\n\n\n"}

Much of this area corresponds to the modern-day state of Rondônia, Brazil. 5 of the 10 Tupian branches are found in this area, as well as some Tupi–Guarani languages (especially Kawahíb), making it the probable urheimat of these languages and maybe of its speaking peoples. Rodrigues believes the Proto-Tupian language dates back to around 3,000 BC.\n\nWhen the Portuguese arrived in Brazil, they found that wherever they went along the vast coast of this newly discovered land, most natives spoke similar languages. Jesuit missionaries took advantage of these similarities, systematizing common standards then named \"línguas gerais\" (\"general languages\"), which were spoken in that region until the 19th century. The best known and most widely spoken of these languages was Old Tupi, a modern descendent of which is still used today by indigenous peoples around the Rio Negro region, where it is known as \"Nheengatu\" (), or the \"good language\". However, the Tupi family also comprises other languages.\n\nIn the neighbouring Spanish colonies, Guarani, another Tupian language closely related to Old Tupi, had a similar history, but managed to resist the spread of Spanish more successfully than Tupi resisted Portuguese. Today, Guarani has 7 million speakers, and is one of the official languages of Paraguay. The Tupian family also includes several other languages with fewer speakers. These share irregular morphology with the Je and Carib families, and Ribeiro connects them all as a Je–Tupi–Carib family.\n\nRodrigues & Cabral (2012) list 10 branches of Tupian, which cluster into Western Tupian and Eastern Tupian.

Though the term has various meanings and has no exact parallel in English, it is generally translated in English as \"leftovers\" or \"leavings\", but with a denigratory aspect. Uchchhishta frequently denotes food scraps after a person has eaten. In a broader sense, it refers to the contamination by food or hand that has come in contact with saliva or the inside of someone's mouth. A person or plate is also said to be Uchchhishta, when he/it comes in contact with Uchchhishta food. Uchchhishta food as well as the Uchchhishta eater/utensil are considered ritually impure. The eater is purified by washing his hand (Hindus traditionally eat with their fingers) and mouth.\n\nIt is highly disrespectful to offer Uchchhishta to someone in general, however it is acceptable to eat Uchchhishta of socially superior individuals, among other exceptions. While an offering of Uchchhishta food or by a person in the Uchchhishta state to Hindu divinities is forbidden in classical Hinduism, some heterodox Tantric deities are worshipped with the taboo offering.\n\nThe Monier-Williams Sanskrit dictionary defines Uchchhishta as: \"left, rejected, stale, spit out of the mouth (as remnants of food); one who has still the remains of food in the mouth or hands, one who has not washed his hands and mouth and therefore is considered impure, impure; leavings, fragments, remainder (especially of a sacrifice or of food)\".\n\nMedhatithi (c. 850–1050 CE), one of the oldest and most famous commentators of the Hindu law book \"Manusmriti\" lists the meanings of Uchchhishta: \n\nWhile Uchchhishta is related to leftovers and contact with saliva, Uchchhishta should be differentiated from other terms also translated in English as \"impure\": \"Amedhya\" (\"unfit for sacrifice\") refers to contamination by contact to human waste, corpses, decomposition etc. and \"malina\" (\"stained\") refers to pollution by physical dirt.\n\nLike other bodily substances like sweat, saliva is considered to be part of body and also not part of it, that is, of \"uncertain status\". Thus, contact with saliva, Uchchhishta, is regarded as impure. The \"Manusmriti\" however does not regard saliva defiling in general, but only in the food context. Drops of saliva, which transmit from one person to another while speaking, are not treated impure.\n\nThe precept of not contaminating all the food or a drink with bacteria or viruses in one's saliva is of particular concern as the health of someone could be threatened through cross contamination.\n\nA medieval Siddhar mocks the concept of Uchchhishta. He questions how are the flowers offered to Hindu deities or honey not defiled by saliva of bees and the cow's milk by the saliva of the calf.\n\n\nUchchhista is generally regarded as highly polluting and impure in Hinduism. Hindus view Uchchhista with revulsion. Eating Uchchhista is considered as humiliating; a Kannada proverb says that he is a dog who eats Uchchhista. Offering Uchchhista to a higher caste member is considered as his insult. \n\nPeople usually do not dip, serve or accept food with the fingers or cutlery that has touched someone's mouth. While cooking also, the cook does not taste food and use the same utensil to stir the food. Once food is tasted with a utensil, it is put away to wash. Food which has been dipped with fingers and cutlery used for eating is considered Uchchhista. While sharing or eating dry food or fruits, the food is portioned so that it does not become contaminated by someone's saliva. For the same reason, Hindus do not generally drink from each other's water glasses. \n\nIn the early 20th century, use of spoons or forks and metal plates were not used by orthodox Hindus as they had come in contact with one's mouth and thus could not be reused as they remained Uchchhista, even though cleaned. One-use leaf plates were preferred; Hindus traditionally eat with their fingers, without cutlery.\n\nUchchhishta is acceptable to be eaten by socially inferior individuals: one's servants, lower caste persons, beggars and animals. \"Untouchables\" including Castes handling human waste historically used to live on leftovers. Eating someone's Uchchhista is seen as a sign of submission and acceptance of the person's superiority.\n\nIn modern India, the rules of Uchchhista are relaxed in the cases of intimacy of a couple or a family. Eating the Uchchhishta food of a young child by his parents is also acceptable, as the child is not regarded a fully-grown separate individual. Parents usually feed young children from their own plate.\n\nIn contrast of the general negative connotations associated with it, eating some types of Uchchhista like of a husband by a wife, of a guru by the student and of a sacrifice or divine offering by all, is highly regarded. Prasad, food offered to a deity and having \"eaten\" by the deity, is sometimes considered the Uchchhista of the gods, as in some parts of North India; however other times as in parts of South India, the comparison of the sacred prasad to Uchchhista, is frowned upon.\n\nA husband is considered equivalent to God for a Hindu wife. As such, wife can eat his Uchchhista as a sign of her love and submission. The wife may eat in the same leaf as the husband's, after he finishes. The husband will leave some food in his plate for her to eat, as a symbol of his love. The custom is ritually performed first at the time of marriage. This act is said to signify her integration in her new family. It is also acceptable if the wife eats the Uchchhista of her in-laws or her husband's brothers.\nThe \"Apastamba Dharmasutra\" (1st-millennium BCE), while describing the code of conduct for a student, refers to the concept of Uchchhishta. In ancient times, a student would stay with a teacher (guru) in the latter's house (Gurukula) and learn. In this period, a student should ask for alms for his livelihood, which he should not consider as Uchchhishta. A student is prescribed to not leave any food uneaten in his plate, that is, leave no Uchchhishta. However, if any Uchchhishta remains, he should bury it, throw it in the water or give it away to a Shudra (a member from the lower social strata). The student is prescribed to eat the Uchchhishta of his guru, which are regarded as sacred as a sacrificial oblation. Eating Uchchhishta of one's father or brother is also acceptable. The \"Vasishtha Dharmasutra\" regards the Uchchhista of the guru, equivalent to medicine that an ill student should have.\n\nExceptions to Uchchhishta are given in the \"Vasishtha Dharmasutra\". Food remnants stuck in teeth or food currently in the mouth are not considered impure, as they are treated part of the mouth like teeth. Swallowing the same cleanses the individual. While pouring water for someone to drink, if drops of water fall on the person's feet; the drops are not Uchchhista, but considered part of the ground.\n\nThe concept of Uchchhishta focuses on purification by washing one's hands and mouth after eating. The cleansing is extended to the kitchen so that so no trace of Uchchhishta or cooking of the meal before, is left.\n\nOffering Uchchhishta food to Hindu deities or worship by an Uchchhishta person is prohibited in mainstream Hinduism. However, the esoteric Tantric goddess Matangi is recommended to be offered Uchchhishta food, in the polluted Uchchhishta state, with the remains of food in the mouth and hands; Matangi is associated with pollution and the outcaste and embodies the forbidden transgression of social norms. The goddess in a legend from the \"Shaktisamgama-tantram\" is also said to be born from Uchchhishta. The deity couples of Shiva-Parvati and Vishnu-Lakshmi dropped specks of food on the ground while eating. A divine maiden rose from the Uchchhishta and asked for their Uchchhishta. The deities blessed her and gave her the name Uchchhishta-Matangini (Matangi).\n\nAnother Tantric deity worshipped in the impure Uchchhishta state is Uchchhishta Ganapati – a Tantric form of the elephant-headed god Ganesha – who also derives his name from Uchchhishta.\n\nWhile Matangi is offered human Uchchhishta, the goddess Vimala is offered divine Uchchhishta of the god Jagannath, a form of Vishnu. Vimala is the Tantric consort of Jagannath and the guardian goddess of the Jagannath Temple, Puri – the principal temple of the god. Vimala is said to be survive of the Uchchhishta of Jagannath; vegetarian food offerings to Jagannath are offered to Vimala, after which they are sanctified as Mahaprasad (prasad). A legend justifies this tradition. Once, Shiva ate a food grain, the Uchchhishta of Vishnu as the latter's prasad. Half the grain stuck in Shiva's bread; however the sage Narada noticed it and ate it. Parvati, was upset that her rightful share of Vishnu's prasad had been eaten by Narada. In a peeved mood, she went to Vishnu and complained. Vishnu pacified her saying that in the Kali Yuga (the present era as per Hindu beliefs), she would live at Puri as Vimala, and would daily eat the remnants of his food.\n\nIn later versions of the Hindu epic \"Ramayana\", Shabari, a forest dweller woman, is instructed by her guru to wait for the arrival of the god Rama in her hermitage. She daily collects wild berries tasting them once for sourness, keeping only the sweet ones and discarding the bitter ones so that she could offer the god Rama only sweet berries, when he visits her. Unknowingly, the berries become Uchchhishta. Over time, she ages to an elderly woman. When Rama finally visits her hermitage, Shabari offers him the Uchchhishta berries. Lakshmana, Rama's brother, objects to the impurity of the Uchchhishta berries, unworthy to be eaten. However, Rama accepts the Uchchhishta berries, as they offered it with great love and devotion.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "33134", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33134", "title": "World music", "text": "World music\n\nWorld music (also called global music or international music) is a musical category encompassing many different styles of music from around the globe, which includes many genres including some forms of Western music represented by folk music, as well as selected forms of ethnic music, indigenous music, neotraditional music, and music where more than one cultural tradition, such as ethnic music and Western popular music, intermingle.\n\nWorld music's inclusive nature and elasticity as a musical category may pose for some obstacles to a universal definition, but its ethic of interest in the culturally exotic is encapsulated in \"Roots\" magazine's description of the genre as \"local music from out there\".\n\nThe term was popularized in the 1980s as a marketing category for non-Western traditional music. Globalization has facilitated the expansion of world music's audiences and scope. It has grown to include hybrid subgenres such as world fusion, global fusion, ethnic fusion, and worldbeat.\n\nThe term has been credited to ethnomusicologist Robert E. Brown, who coined it in the early 1960s at Wesleyan University in Connecticut, where he developed undergraduate through the doctoral programs in the discipline. To enhance the process of learning, he invited more than a dozen visiting performers from Africa and Asia and began a world music concert series. The term became current in the 1980s as a marketing/classificatory device in the media and the music industry. There are several conflicting definitions for world music. One is that it consists of \"all the music in the world\", though such a broad definition renders the term virtually meaningless.\n\nThe term also is taken as a classification of music that combines Western popular music styles with one of many genres of non-Western music that are also described as folk music or ethnic music. However, world music is not exclusively traditional folk music. It may include cutting edge pop music styles as well. Succinctly, it can be described as \"local music from out there\", or \"someone else's local music\". It is a very nebulous term with an increasing number of genres that fall under the umbrella of world music to capture musical trends of combined ethnic style and texture, including Western elements (examples noted in this section).\n\nWorld music may incorporate distinctive non-Western scales, modes and/or musical inflections, and often features distinctive traditional ethnic instruments, such as the kora (West African harp), the steel drum, the sitar or the didgeridoo.\n\nMusic from around the world exerts wide cross-cultural influence as styles naturally influence one another, and in recent years world music has also been marketed as a successful genre in itself. Academic study of world music, as well as the musical genres and individual artists associated with it appear in such disciplines as anthropology, folkloristics, performance studies and ethnomusicology.\n\nIn the age of digital music production the increased availability of high-quality, ethnic music samples, sound bites and loops from every known region are commonly used in commercial music production, which has exposed a vast spectrum of indigenous music texture to developing, independent artists. These influences proliferate quickly in a web-based music industry that is now percolating as a much larger, predominantly self-promoted menu, via an increasing number of indie-artist-friendly, streaming Internet options, such as Last.fm, Rhapsody, Live365, Jango Artist Airplay and ReverbNation.\n\nAn amalgamation of roots music in the global, contemporary listening palette has become apparent, which weakens the role major entertainment labels can play in the cultural perception of genre boundaries. As a result, definitions of the genre have become particularly varied, and determined by particularly wide-ranging and varied opinions.\n\nSimilar terminology between distinctly different sub-categories under primary music genres, such as world, rock and pop can be as ambiguous and confusing to industry moguls as it is to consumers. This is especially true in the context of world music, where branches of ethnically influenced pop trends are as genre-defined by consumer perception as they are by the music industry forums that govern the basis for categorical distinction. Academic scholars tend to agree that, in today's world of consumer music reviews and blogging, global music culture's public perception is what ultimately distils a prevailing basis for definition from genre ambiguity, regardless of how clearly a category has been outlined by corporate marketing forums and music journalism. The world music genre's gradual migration from a clear spectrum of roots music traditions to an extended list of hybrid subgenres is a good example of the motion genre boundaries can exhibit in a globalizing pop culture.\n\nThe classic, original definition of world music was in part created to instill a perceived authenticity and distinction between indigenous music traditions and those that eventually become diluted by pop culture, and the modern debate over how possible it is to maintain that perception in the richly diverse genre of world music is ongoing.\n\nIn a report on the 2014 \"globalFEST\" National Public Radio's Anastasia Tsioulcas said \"Even within the \"world music\" community, nobody likes the term \"world music.\" It smacks of all kinds of loaded issues, from cultural colonialism to questions about what's \"authentic\" and what isn't (and who might get to police such inquiries), and forces an incredible array of styles that don't have anything in common under the label of \"exotic Other.\" What's more: I believe that in many people's imaginations, \"world music\" means a kind of fairly awful, gloppy, hippy-ish, worldbeat fusion. It's a problematic, horrible term that satisfies absolutely no one.\"\n\nExamples of popular forms of world music include the various forms of non-European classical music (e.g. Japanese koto and Chinese guzheng music, Indian raga music, Tibetan chants), Eastern European folk music (e.g. the village music of the Balkans, The Mystery Of The Bulgarian Voices), Nordic folk music and the many forms of folk and tribal music of the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Oceania, Central and South America, Latin music, and Indonesian music.\n\nThe Breton musician Alan Stivell pioneered the connection between traditional folk music, modern rock music and world music with his 1972 album \"Renaissance of the Celtic Harp\". At this time, Stivell's contemporary, Welsh singer-songwriter Meic Stevens popularised Welsh folk music. Neo-traditional Welsh language music featuring a fusion of modern instruments and traditional instruments such as the Pibgorn and the Welsh harp has been further developed by artists such as Bob Delyn a'r Ebillion. Lebanese musical pioneer Lydia Canaan fused Middle-Eastern quarter notes and microtones with anglophone folk, and is listed in the catalog of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum's Library and Archives as the first rock star of the Middle East.\n\nMore recently, other Welsh-language bands such as Calan and 9 Bach have achieved international acclaim. Experimental psychedelic rock group Super Furry Animals's Welsh-language album \"Mwng\" was released in May 2000 and re-released in May 2015, captures the spirit of World music as 'trying to hang on to something that's under serious threat from advanced capitalism'.\n\nThe broad category of world music includes isolated forms of ethnic music from diverse geographical regions. These dissimilar strains of ethnic music are commonly categorized together by virtue of their indigenous roots. Over the 20th century, the invention of sound recording, low-cost international air travel and common access to global communication among artists and the general public has given rise to a related phenomenon called \"crossover\" music. Musicians from diverse cultures and locations could readily access recorded music from around the world, see and hear visiting musicians from other cultures and visit other countries to play their own music, creating a melting pot of stylistic influences. While communication technology allows greater access to obscure forms of music, the pressures of commercialization also present the risk of increasing musical homogeneity, the blurring of regional identities, and the gradual extinction of traditional local music-making practices.\n\nSince the music industry established this term, the fuller scope of what an average music consumer defines as \"world\" music in today's market has grown to include various blends of ethnic music tradition, style and interpretation, and derivative world music genres have been coined to represent these hybrids, such as World fusion, Global fusion, Ethnic fusion or Worldbeat. Good examples of hybrid, world fusion are the Irish / West African meld of Afro Celt Sound System, the pan-cultural sound of AO Music and the jazz / Finnish folk music of Värttinä, each of which bear tinges of contemporary, Western influence—an increasingly noticeable element in the expansion genres of world music. World fusion / Worldbeat / Ethnic fusion / Global fusion can also blend specific indigenous sounds with more blatant elements of Western pop. Good examples are Paul Simon's album \"Graceland\", on which South African Mbaqanga music is heard, Peter Gabriel's work with Pakistani Sufi singer, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, the Deep Forest project, in which vocal loops from West Africa are blended with Western, contemporary rhythmic textures and harmony structure, and the work of Mango, who combined pop and rock music with world elements.\n\nMore recent bands who exhibit experimentation with World music Hybrid Forms include Vampire Weekend, The Very Best, Island Cassettes & Yeasayer, many of which cite inspiration from the work of Paul Simon.\n\nDepending on style and context, world music can sometimes share the new-age music genre, which is a category that often includes Ambient music and textural expressions from indigenous roots sources. Good examples are Tibetan bowls, Tuvan throat singing, Gregorian chant or Native American flute music. World music blended with new-age music is a sound, loosely classified as the hybrid genre, ethnic fusion. Examples of ethnic fusion are Nicholas Gunn's \"Face-to-Face\" from \"Beyond Grand Canyon,\" featuring authentic Native American flute combined with synthesizers, and \"Four Worlds\" from \"The Music of the Grand Canyon\", featuring spoken word from Razor Saltboy of the Navajo Indian Nation.\n\nThe subgenre world fusion is often mistakenly assumed to refer exclusively to a blending of Western jazz fusion elements with world music. Although such a hybrid expression falls easily into the world fusion category, the suffix \"fusion\" in the term world fusion should not be assumed to mean only jazz fusion. Western jazz combined with strong elements of world music is more accurately termed \"world fusion jazz\", \"ethnic jazz\" or \"non-Western jazz\". World fusion and global fusion are nearly synonymous with the genre term \"worldbeat\", and though these are considered subgenres of popular music, they may also imply universal expressions of the more general term, \"world music\". Throughout the 1970s and 80s, fusion in the jazz music genre implied a blending of jazz and rock music, which is where the misleading assumption is rooted.\n\nAlthough it primarily describes traditional music, the world music category also includes popular music from non-Western urban communities (e.g. South African \"township\" music) and non-European music forms that have been influenced by other so-called third-world musics (e.g. Afro-Cuban music), although Western-style popular song sourced from non-English-speaking countries in Europe (e.g. French pop music) would not generally be considered world music.\n\nParis is one of the great European capitals for world music. For many years, the city has attracted numerous musicians from former colonies in West and North Africa. This scene is aided by the fact that there are many concerts and institutions that help to promote the music.\n\nAlgerian and Moroccan music have an important presence in the French capital. Hundreds of thousands of Algerian and Moroccan immigrants have settled in Paris, bringing the sounds of Amazigh (Berber), raï, and Gnawa music. Algerian raï also found a large French audience.\n\nThe West African community is also very large, integrated by people from Senegal, Mali, Ivory Coast, and Guinea. They have introduced manding jeli music, mbalax and other styles.\n\nOne origin of the term was the initiation of (\"World Music Day\") in 1982 in France. World Music Day has been celebrated on 21 June every year since then. On 29 June 1987 a meeting of interested parties gathered to capitalize on the marketing of this genre. Arguably popular interest was sparked with the release in 1986 of Paul Simon's \"Graceland\" album. The concept behind the album was to express his own sensibilities using the sounds he had fallen in love with while listening to artists from Southern Africa, including Ladysmith Black Mambazo and Savuka. This project and the work of Peter Gabriel and Johnny Clegg among others had, to some degree, introduced non-Western music to a wider audience. They saw this as an opportunity. Zila Khan is one of today's leading singers in World Music.\n\nBefore 1987, world music had a following but it was still difficult for interested parties to sell their music to the larger music stores. Although specialist music stores had been important in developing the genre over many years, the record companies, broadcasters and journalists had been finding it difficult to build a following because the music, itself, seemed too scarce. However, they were aware that the jazz and classical markets had developed a crossover audience. They decided the best way forward would be a collective strategy to bring the music to a wider audience.\n\nAt around this time, Cultural Co-operation started the Music Village Festival. This regular series of free world music festivals continues to run. They also started a network of world music artists to help promote their work.\n\nAt the outset of the 1987 meeting, the musician Roger Armstrong advised the reason why something had to be done:\nThe first concern of the meetings was to select the umbrella name that this music would be listed under. Suggestions included \"world beat\" and prefixing words such as \"hot\" or \"tropical\" to existing genre titles. \"World music\" won after a show of hands, but initially it was not meant to be the title for a whole new genre—but just something the record labels could place on record sleeves to distinguish them during the forthcoming campaign. Afterward, they agreed that despite the publicity campaign, this wasn't an exclusive club—and that for the good of all, any label that sold this type of music could use the name.\n\nAnother issue was the distribution methods at the time. Most main labels were unhappy with the lack of specialist knowledge in their sales force, which led to poor service. Many larger outlets were reluctant to carry the music, because they favored larger releases they could promote within the store. It was difficult to justify a large presentation expense with limited stock going into stores.\n\nOne of the marketing strategies used in the vinyl market at the time was the use of browser cards, which would appear in the record racks. As part of the \"world music\" campaign, it was decided that these would be a two color affair designed to carry a special offer package; to aid the retailer a selection of labels would also be included, presumably for shelf or rack edging.\n\nIn an unprecedented move, all of the world music labels coordinated together and developed a compilation cassette for the cover of the music magazine \"NME\". The overall running time was 90 minutes, each package containing a mini-catalog showing the other releases on offer.\n\nBy the time of a second meeting it became clear that a successful campaign required its own dedicated press officer. The press officer would be able to juggle various deadlines and sell the music as a concept—not just to national stations, but also regional DJs keen to expand their musical variety. DJs were a key resource as it was important to make \"world music\" important to people outside London—most regions after all had a similarly heritage to tap into. A cost-effective way of achieving all this would be a leafleting campaign.\n\nThe next step was to develop a world music chart, gathering together selling information from around fifty shops, so that it would finally be possible to see which were big sellers in the genre—so new listeners could see what was particularly popular. It was agreed that the \"NME\" could again be involved in printing the chart and also \"Music Week\" and the London listings magazine \"City Limits\". It was also suggested that Andy Kershaw might be persuaded to do a run down of this chart on his show regularly.\n\nIn most wealthy industrialized countries, large amounts of immigration from other regions has been ongoing for many decades. This has introduced non-Western music to Western audiences not only \nas \"exotic\" imports, but also as local music played by fellow citizens. Caribbean music in the United Kingdom or Chicano rock in the United States would be two obvious examples. But the process is ongoing and continues to produce new forms. In the 2010s several musicians from immigrant communities in the West rose to global popularity, such as Haitian-American Wyclef Jean, Somali-Canadian K'naan, Tamil-Briton M.I.A., or Lebanese-Colombian Shakira, often blending the music of their heritage with hip-hop or pop. Cuban-born singer-songwriter Addys Mercedes started her international career from Germany mixing traditional elements of Son with pop.\n\nThe diverse nature of major Western cities has changed the pace of musical intermixing. Once, an established Western artist might collaborate with an established African artist to produce an album or two. Now, new bands and new genres are built from the ground up by young performers. For example, the Punjabi-Irish fusion band Delhi 2 Dublin is from neither India nor Ireland, but Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Country for Syria, an Istanbul based music collective, blends American Country music with the music of Syrian refugees and local Turkish music.\n\nIn Vancouver, musicians and composers also work collectively to create original compositions for various combinations of ethnic and western instruments.\n\nThe World Music Month was designated in October 1987. It is a music festival held at the Town & Country Club in London, and it was the start of the winter season for both WOMAD and \"Arts Worldwide\". The main press release stressed the issues inherent in the campaign.\n\nSince the early 1980s the enthusiasm for music from 'outside' Western pop culture has been steadily mounting. More and more international artists, many of whom are big stars in their own countries, are coming to England and North America on tour. They started off, like the Bhundu Boys, playing small clubs and pubs, but now many acts are so popular that they are filling larger venues.\n\nExamples of radio shows that feature world music include \"World of Music\" on Voice of America, \"Transpacific Sound Paradise\" on WFMU, \"The Planet\" on Australia's ABC Radio National, DJ Edu presenting \"D.N.A: DestiNation Africa\" on BBC Radio 1Xtra, Adil Ray on the BBC Asian Network, Andy Kershaw's show on BBC Radio 3 and Charlie Gillett's show on the BBC World Service.\n\nWorld music radio programs today often play African hip hop or reggae artists, crossover Bhangra and Latin American jazz groups, etc. Common media for world music include public radio, webcasting, the BBC, NPR, and ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corporation). The scope of what is considered world music has increased. By default, non-region-specific or multi-cultural world music projects are often listed under the generic category of world music.\n\nThe generally accepted geographic standard for what designates world music is withstanding criticism for its universal asymmetry, where nearly every classifiable region under the term is defined, relative to Western music culture; this is primarily due to the fact that dominant corporate structures for music distribution and promotion originate in and , as do the forums for establishing industry genre categories.\nTherefore, in market context, \"ethnic\" music is synthetically defined by a radius that extends from a Western center.\n\nSome musicians and curators of music have come to dislike the term \"world music\".\nTo these critics, \"world music\" is a parochial, catch-all marketing term for non-Western music of all genres.\nIn , label founder and ex-Talking Heads frontman David Byrne wrote an \" editorial in \" explaining his objections to the term. Byrne argued that the labelling and categorization of other cultures as \"exotic\" serves to attract an insincere consumption and deter other potential consumers.\n\nThe BBC Radio 3 Awards for World Music was an award given to world music artists between 2002 and 2008, sponsored by BBC Radio 3. The award was thought up by \"fRoots\" magazine's editor Ian Anderson, inspired by the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards. Award categories included: Africa, Asia/Pacific, Americas, Europe, Mid East and North Africa, Newcomer, Culture Crossing, Club Global, Album of the Year, and Audience Award. Initial lists of nominees in each category were selected annually by a panel of several thousand industry experts. Shortlisted nominees were voted on by a twelve-member jury, which selected the winners in every category except for the Audience Award category. These jury members were appointed and presided over by the BBC. The annual awards ceremony was held at the BBC Proms and winners were given an award called a \"Planet\". In March 2009, the BBC made a decision to axe the BBC Radio 3 Awards for World Music.\n\nIn response to the BBC's decision to end its awards program, the British world music magazine \"Songlines\" launched the Songlines Music Awards in 2009 \"to recognise outstanding talent in world music\".\n\nThe WOMEX Awards were introduced in 1999 to honor the high points of world music on an international level and to acknowledge musical excellence, social importance, commercial success, political impact and lifetime achievement. Every October at the WOMEX event, the award figurine—an ancient mother goddess statue dating back about 6000 years to the Neolithic age—is presented in an award ceremony to a worthy member of the world music community.\n\nMany festivals are identified as being \"world music\"; here is a small representative selection:\n\n\nAustralia\n\nBangladesh\n\nBelgium\n\nCanada\n\nCroatia\n\nFrance\n\nGermany\n\nHungary\n\n\nIceland\n\nIndia\nIndonesia\nIran\n\nItaly\n\n\nMacedonia\n\nMalaysia\n\nMali\n\nMorocco\n\nNew Zealand\n\nPoland\n\nPortugal\n\nRomania\n\nSerbia\n\n\nSpain\nSpain's most important world music festivals are:\n\n\nSweden\n, Green World Yoga & Sacred Music Festival, June this year at Skåne.\n\nTurkey\n\nUganda\n\nUkraine\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nUnited States\n\n\n\n\n"}

Kimbap and jokbal is also popular. Past favorites, now less popular, include memilmuk (buckwheat jelly) and chapssaltteok(rice cakes filled with sweet beans). \n\nFried chicken, first introduced in Korea in the 1980s, and pizza also top the list of night-time favorites. Fried chicken, in particular, has become a wide market, with chicken restaurant chains continually developing new sauces and wooing various Hallyu stars to promote their respective brands. Of course, no late-night chicken order would be complete without a cool pitcher of draft beer.\n"}
