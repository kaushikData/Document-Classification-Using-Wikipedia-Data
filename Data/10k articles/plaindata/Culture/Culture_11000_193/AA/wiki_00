ASSIST places academically and extracurricularly excelling international students on one-year merit-based scholarships at American independent secondary schools.\n\nASSIST is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization with tax-exempt status incorporated in the state of Vermont. ASSIST is designated by the United States State Department as an authorized Exchange Visitor Program and is listed with the Council on Standards for International Educational Travel. This arrangement allows ASSIST to use the services of American facilities and staff overseas and has made possible the endorsement and support of international government officials. ASSIST is able to facilitate the issuance of the J-1 visa, under which some of its students study in the United States for one academic year on Exchange Visitor status.\n\nASSIST was founded in 1969 by Paul G. Sanderson, Jr., then Suffield Academy’s Director of Admissions, who wanted to enrich American independent secondary schools through an international educational community. Sanderson began with a class of 13 students and started ASSIST as an educational and cultural exchange program to bring talented young men and women to study in the United States on one-year scholarships.\n\nFrom its original base in Germany, ASSIST has expanded to numerous other countries and has brought students from nations underrepresented in member schools’ student bodies.\n\nAfter the death of Sanderson, Kenneth and Betsy Lindfors were appointed to lead ASSIST. During their 13-year tenure, ASSIST expanded substantially. Following their retirement, the ASSIST Board of Directors named Robert and Anne Stanley as the third leadership team in ASSIST’s history. Today, Robert Stanley continues as President, joined by Martin Milne as Vice President for School and Family Relations, and Meg Milne Moulton as Vice President for Marketing & Communications.\n\nTo date, more than 4,300 students from 51 countries have become ASSIST Scholars.\n\nASSIST's recruitment and interview teams travel around the world interviewing potential program candidates. In 2013, from a pool of 1,650 applications, 725 finalists were invited to an interview, and 161 were accepted as ASSIST Scholars.\n\nOver 90% of ASSIST students earn honors or high honors academic standing each year. Students are also selected to make contributions to the artistic, athletic, community service and other extracurricular programs and to share their own cultural backgrounds. In the class of 2013/2014, ASSIST scholars come from 20 countries, including Somaliland, and have fluency in three languages on average. Their talents range from award-winning athletes to championship debaters to nationally-recognized musicians.\n\nAll ASSIST member schools are independent high schools and are members of the National Association of Independent Schools. Every school agrees to accept at least one international student on a full scholarship and may also accept additional students on partial scholarships. The scholarship includes tuition and room and board. Scholarships are offered for one year only, after which the scholar must return home to complete his or her secondary education.\n\nASSIST reviews member schools twice annually. Each school is visited by ASSIST staff and volunteers to ensure that the programs available meet the needs of the students who apply to the ASSIST program.\n\nThe organization is active in more than twenty countries per year. Its head office is located in Suffield, Connecticut, United States.\n"}

It was built in 1911.\n\nThe theatre was built at the request of magnate Daniel Mailov and funded by magnate Zeynalabdin Taghiyev. In 1910, famous Russian soprano Antonina Nezhdanova visited Baku giving several concerts at various clubs and performance venues. On a ball organized on the occasion of Nezhdanova's departure at the local casino, she was asked whether she would like to visit Baku again. Her response was negative followed by a concern that in a city of so many wealthy people no one would fund the construction of a decent opera theatre where singers could fully demonstrate their musical talent. Daniel Mailov who had grown to admire both Nezhdanova's voice and persona during her tour decided to use this opportunity and offered her to revisit Baku in one year to attend the opening of a new opera theatre, which he would order to build in her honour. According to an urban legend, Mailov and his brother were not invited to a housewarming ball of a famous opera singer from Baku whose new house (now the head office of SOCAR) was one of the most outstanding pieces of architecture in the city. The Mailovs therefore decided to erect a building of their own outdoing the \"tactless\" singer.\n\nThe Russian architect and civil engineer of Armenian descent Nikolai Bayev designed the architectural sketch of the theatre. However the construction of such grandiose building in a year was unheard of at the time and required many safety measures to be taken. The Mailovs decided not to wait for the approval of the City Council but were ordered to stop the construction as it violated building regulations. Soon Bayev managed to convince the city legislature and received its approval. Azeri magnate Zeynalabdin Taghiyev who had earlier sponsored the construction of the Taghiyev Theatre (present-day Azerbaijan State Musical Comedy Theatre) expressed his doubts that the new theatre could be fully constructed in such a short period of time. Daniel Mailov laid a bet: if the Mailovs did not manage to get the theatre built on time, they would offer it to Taghiyev as a gift; if the theatre was indeed built by 1911, Taghiyev would have to cover all the building expenses.\n\nThe three-shift work at the site involving 200 workers ensured speedy construction of the building. All works were completed in less than 10 months. The total costs for construction exceeded 250,000 rubles. The city mayor Peter Martynov accompanied by architects and engineers examined the newly built theatre and confirmed its safety. As promised, Taghiyev paid all the expenses. The official opening of the Mailyovs' Theatre was scheduled on 28 February 1911. Daniel Mailov notified Nezhdanova of the ceremony by telegramme beforehand, and the renowned soprano became the first singer to perform at the new opera house. Most of Baku's multiethnic elite attended the event; among the ones not present was the opera singer who had not invited the Mailovs to his housewarming ball.\n\nIn 1916, the theatre acquired a resident organization (Pavel Amirago's opera troupe) and began to function on a permanent basis. In 1920, it became a state theatre known as the Opera and Ballet Theatre. In 1925, the Azerbaijani Opera Troupe, the Russian Opera Troupe and the Drama Troupe united to become the official resident organization, and in 1927 the theatre was named after writer Mirza Fatali Akhundov. In 1959, it received the status of an academic theatre.\n\nIn 1985, the newly renovated theatre mysteriously burned down. In 1987, all the restoratory works were finished and the theatre reopened its doors.\n\nSingers who have been associated with opera company include, Azer Zeynalov, Javid Samadov, and Shovkat Mammadova.\n\n"}

{"id": "57125728", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57125728", "title": "Black Horror on the Rhine", "text": "Black Horror on the Rhine\n\nThe Black Horror on the Rhine refers to a moral panic which was aroused in Germany concerning allegations of widespread war crimes, especially sexual war crimes, said to be committed by Senegalese and other African soldiers serving in the French Army during the French occupation of the Rhineland between 1918-1930.\n\nFollowing the Kiel Mutiny on 3 November 1918, revolutionary sailors visited numerous cities across Germany announcing the German Revolution. The German Army had already been experiencing a series of mutinies, particularly since the failure of the German Spring offensive which was brought to a halt in July 1918. Soldiers from the French Colonial army played a significant role in defending the city of Reims which was under siege during the German attack. As one German writer put it \"It is not the French fighting at Reims. France has entrusted the protection of the ancient city of coronation to black and brown soldiers. It is true that the defence of Reims does not cost a drop of French blood, it is Negroes who are sacrificed.\"\n\nBy the evening of 6 November 200 revolutionary soldiers had reached the city of Cologne, where they joined local workers and soldiers to establish a Workers and Soldiers' Council, along the lines of the Russian soviets. When reports of this reached Wilhelm Groener, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Imperial German Army he no longer supported the Wilhelm II's plan to instigate a civil war, but rather joined the call of Friedrich Ebert, leader of the Majority Social Democratic Party of Germany (MSPD) for the Kaiser to abdicate. This the Kaiser did on 9 November, and Ebert became Chancellor of Germany the same day. The MSPD became active in opposing the revolution and worked with the army to establish a liberal republic.\n\nThus the Rhineland had played a significant role in toppling the Kaiser and obliging the German state to accept the armistice. Likewise, the African soldiers of the French Army played a significant role in the defeat of the Imperial German Army in the Second Battle of the Marne. This battle which was a decisive victory for the allies, saw the French Army using a massed tank attack alongside forces of its colonial army. Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg wrote in his 1920 memoirs \"Mein Leben\": \"Where there were no tanks our enemy sent black waves against us. Waves of black Africans! Woe to us when these waves reached our lines and massacred or worse, tortured our defenseless men!\" Notwithstanding this somewhat odd remark by the Chief of the German General Staff, the highly armed German Army used poison gas in attacks on French Colonial Troops in the battle of Reims. The American historian Keith Nelson considers Hindenburg's view of the Senegalese as typical of German views of the Senegalese, and claims there is evidence to suggest that many German soldiers were reluctant to surrender to the Senegalese out of the belief that they would be eaten as racist propaganda that the Senegalese were cannibals from \"darkest Africa\" was widely believed.\n\nFollowing the defeat of the Second French Empire by the Prussians in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870/1, a current of revanchism developed in France which sought to regain the lost territory of Alsace-Lorraine which had been ceded to the newly formed German Empire. Thus politicians such as Georges Clemenceau, of the Radical Republicans, opposed participation in the scramble for Africa as they were concern it would divert the Republic from objectives related regaining Alsace-Lorraine. Nevertheless, French officers repeatedly ignored orders, as they lead the French Army on various campaigns in Africa. Charles Mangin, a career officer in the French Army with campaign experience in Africa set out to resolve these conflicting imperialist strategies in his book his 1910 book \"La force noire\" (\"The Black Force\") He argued that as Germany had a greater population and a higher birth rate than France in the early 20th century this meant that the German Army was potentially going to be larger than the French Army. He proposed that the French had recruited extensively from their African colonies to provide an almost limitless source of manpower that could counter Germany's numerical superiority. Thus the expansion of the French colonial empire could be seen as complementing rather than competing with the desire to oblige Germany to return the lost territory.\n\nOne of the products of the French revolution was a concept of the nation linked to citizenship and military service. The levée en masse or forced mass military conscription was introduced in 1793 during the French Revolutionary Wars. This gave rise to the demand that by serving in the French Army, colonial subjects should gain full French citizenship. However whilst military service provided a very clear expression of political allegiance to the state, French society had developed the idea of the statut personnel by which particularly French Muslims would have a distinct status, being governed by Koranic law administered by local religious authorities. As the norms of Islam permitted polygamy, this created what were considered insurmountable problems by those who defended an assimilationist viewpoint. Many of the assimilationists saw the culture and civilisation of France as something far superior to what they regarded as the barbaric customs of their non-European subjects. Another political current, the associationists advocated something along the lines of indirect rule as practised by the British Empire. They saw the colonised subjects as having to find their own path to civilisation and relied on local elites to manage the colonial system on the ground. Both, however, viewed the subject peoples as being in debt to their conquerors, who by dominating them offered the allegedly profound benefits of French culture. Thus, despite the egalitarian ideology of the French Third Republic – which would theoretically exclude any color line – the development of French colonies created a quite different reality.\n\nHowever the election of Blaise Diagne in February 1914 provided a champion for the demand of citizenship rights for colonial soldiers. Diagne represented the Four Communes, the four oldest colonial towns in French West Africa which had won the right to send deputies to the Chamber of Deputies following the 1848 revolution.\nWithin the ideology of the republic, having Africans and Asians fighting in the French Army was proof of the universalism of French civilization which was open to all. Unlike the British who sent an Indian Army corps to the Western Front in October 1914, which was pulled out in 1916 once there were enough white divisions to replace the Indians, the French kept their Algerian, Tunisian, Moroccan, Senegalese, Malagasy and Vietnamese divisions on the front-line right to the end of war. Through in practice, there was a color line in France, within the context of the times France was a nation that was relatively open to non-white people with for example the African-American singer Josephine Baker finding a degree of acceptance in France that she never found in her own country. The French called anyone from French West Africa \"Senegalese\" regardless if they actually came from Senegal or not; many of the \"Senegalese\" were not from Senegal.\n\nThrough Germany had also recruited soldiers in its African colonies both before and during World War I, the British blockade prevented any \"Askaris\" from fighting in Europe for Germany. During the war, German propaganda had often attacked the French for deploying African soldiers to fight in Europe, claiming that black men were innately savage and barbaric and it was unacceptable for the French to use Senegalese soldiers in Europe as it \"endangered\" European civilization.\n\nUnder the terms of the armistice which ended the fighting on the Western Front on 11 November 1918, the Allies had the right to occupy the Rhineland, and during the negotiations the Germans had specifically demanded that no Senegalese be included in the French occupation force. However, as the terms of the armistice were dictated to the Germans, this was of little import. Under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which was signed on 28 June 1919, the Allies had the right to occupy the Rhineland until 1935, through in fact the last Allied forces were pulled out of the Rhineland in June 1930. The German fears of the Senegalese were widely shared amongst white people in the English-speaking world, and both the U.S. President Woodrow Wilson and the British Prime Minister David Lloyd George asked the French Premier Georges Clemenceau that no Senegalese being used as occupation troops in the Rhineland.\n\nThe first non-European troops to arrive in Germany were soldiers from the Siamese Expeditionary Forces who arrived in Neustadt, in the Palatinate in December 1918. However, their presence which lasted until July 1919 did not cause great upset. Concerns were raised about the subsequent arrival of African troops in the Rhineland, first a regiment from Madagascar, and then the first Senegalese unit in May 1919. General Mangin had gone out of his way to ensure that African units were stationed as part of the Rhineland occupation force. The French deployed African soldiers to the Rhineland in part as not to ensure that build-up of black troops in France, and partly because the Germans had asked them not to be deployed. Mangin had insisted since the French were the victors, they were not going to be dictated to by the vanquished.For Diagne it was important that his fellow Senegalese be deployed to the Rhineland as a way of showing that they were equal and enjoyed the same respect as white French citizens. In a meeting with Clemenceau, Diagne had insisted that if French civilization was truly universal, then the Senegalese should allowed to march into the Rhineland alongside the rest of the French Army and not be excluded simply because the Germans found them offensive. The Francophile Diagne, who believed in the ideal of France's \"civilizing mission\" in Africa, had played a key role in the recruitment soldiers in Senegal to fight for France, and thus had more influence than what his position as a mere Deputy might suggest. The \"colored\" troops in the Rhineland were conscripts from Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Senegal, Madagascar and Vietnam. At their peak, the \"colored\" soldiers were 14% of the French occupation force in the Rhineland. On 1 August 1919, an ultra-nationalist group called the \"Rheinische Volkspflege\" (Protectors of the Rhenish People) was founded with the purpose of seeking to turn public opinion against French support for the Rhenish separatism, and who hit upon the idea of using alleged crimes committed by blacks serving in the French Army as the best way to do so. Closely allied to the \"Rheinische Volkspflege\" was the woman's group, the \"Rheinische Frauenliga\" which was founded in early 1920. The articles published by the \"Rheinische Frauenliga\" articulated \"fantastical visions of imperialism and cultural decline\" as the mass rapes alleged to be committed by the Senegalese became a metaphor for Franco-German relations.\n\nOn 1 August 1919, an ultra-nationalist group called the \"Rheinische Volkspflege\" (Protectors of the Rhenish People) was founded with the purpose of seeking to turn public opinion against French support for the Rhenish separatism, and who hit upon the idea of using alleged crimes committed by blacks serving in the French Army as the best way to do so. Closely allied to the \"Rheinische Volkspflege\" was the woman's group, the \"Rheinische Frauenliga\" which was founded in early 1920. The articles published by the \"Rheinische Frauenliga\" articulated \"fantastical visions of imperialism and cultural decline\" as the mass rapes alleged to be committed by the Senegalese became a metaphor for Franco-German relations.\nThe \"Rheinische Frauenliga\" was in very close contact with E. D. Morel–a leading British radical liberal and an advocate of the viewpoint that the Treaty of Versailles was too harsh on Germany–and much of Morel's writings on the issue was based on reports provided to him by the \"Rheinische Frauenliga\". Morel, a white supremacist who was obsessed with a fear of the sexuality of black men, genuinely believed that black men had an uncontrolled sexuality that made them want to rape white women with abandon, and throughout his writings on the subject he accused the Senegalese of raping German women on an industrial scale, claiming that thousands upon thousands of German women and girls were raped by the Senegalese on a daily basis. The African-American historian Clarence Lusance accused Morel of leading \"one of the most racist political campaigns to be launched in the first half of the 20th century\".\n\nThere was political turmoil in Germany when it came to signing the Versailles Treaty. In June 1919 Philipp Scheidemann, the first democratically elected Chancellor of Germany resigned when faced with allied ultimatum that it should be signed with none of the changes the German government had requested. His was succeeded as Chancellor by Gustav Bauer. The terms of the treaty meant that the counter-revolutionary Freikorps which the Weimar government had created to crush the revolutionary movement faced being disbanded. Rather than submit to this, Wolfgang Kapp gathered significant Army officers around him and launched the Kapp Putsch. The success of the Putsch would open up a possibility of a recommencement of the First World War, a fact not lost on Marshal Foch.\n\nInitially, there were only a few complaints from the German side about the presence of the Senegalese in the Rhineland, and not until April 1920 when the French used Moroccan soldiers to occupy Frankfurt that a hysterical campaign against the French use of \"colored\" soldiers began in Germany. The issue of the deployment of \"colored\" troops was first discussed in the \"Reichstag\" in January 1920. Ray Beveridge, a German-American woman living in Germany had given a series of speeches in Hamburg and Munich in February–March 1920 warning of the dangers of miscegenation to \"the purity of the German race\" caused by the presence of the Senegalese in the Rhineland. E.D. Morel had written in a letter to the editor of \"The Nation\" on 27 March 1920 about the French who \"thrust barbarians–barbarians belonging to a race inspired by Nature with tremendous sexual instincts into the heart of Europe\".\n\nIn early April 1920, Germany violated the terms of the Treaty of Versailles by sending the \"Reichswehr\" into the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland, which led the French to occupy Frankfurt on 6 April 1920 as a reprisal, saying that they would not leave Germany's business capital until the \"Reichswehr\" left the demilitarized zone. One of the French Army units involved in occupying Frankfurt was a Moroccan company that fired into a crowd of demonstrators. Under the front-page of \"The Daily Herald\" on 9 April 1920, there was a cover story reporting on the occupation of Frankfort by Morel whose title read: \"Frankfurt runs red with blood French Blood Troops Use Machine-guns on Civilians\". The next day another front-page article by Morel had the title: \"Black Scourge In Europe Sexual Horror Let Loose by France On Rhine Disappearance of Young German Girls\". Morel wrote France is \"thrusting her black savages into the heart of Germany\", saying these \"primitive African savages, the carriers of syphilis, have become a horror and a terror\". As Morel was a man whose left-wing \"credentials were unimpeachable\" as he had gone to prison for opposing British involvement in the First World, his articles attracted much attention both in Britain and abroad. Like many other British leftists, Morel was bitterly opposed to the Treaty of Versailles which denounced as an unjust treaty which he blamed on a revanchist France.\n\nIn his 1919 book \"The Black's Man Burden\", Morel had denounced mandate system of the Treaty of Versailles for the former German colonies Africa, writing that black people could not survive \"modern capitalist exploitation\". Morel wrote that \"French militarists, whose schemes are a menace to the entire world\" would use these \"Negroes, Malagasies, Berbers and Arabs...in the interest of a capitalist and militant Order\". Specifically, Morel believed the French would use their African troops to put down strikes by the white working classes in Europe, and the theme of the French Army's Senegalese soldiers are as a brutal force upholding capitalism was a recurring one in Morel's articles in \"The Daily Herald\" in 1919 and 1920. Given Morel's views about the Senegalese and his opposition to the Treaty of Versailles, he was predisposed to believe any horror story that might come out of the Rhineland.\n\nThe \"Auswärtige Amt\" saw a chance to turn international opinion against France over this issue, and in April 1920 began a sustained propaganda campaign against the French use of \"colored\" troops. The \"Auswärtige Amt\" issued \"talking points\" to German newspapers, which all through the spring of 1920 ran front-page stories accusing the Senegalese of sorts of atrocities against German civilians. The stories about the \"Die schwarze Schand\" (\"the black shame\") appeared frequently in the German press in the spring of 1920, running what Nelson called hysterical stories with \"astonishing\" frequency. The German MSPD chancellor Hermann Müller in a speech complained that \"Senegalese Negroes occupy the University of Frankfort and guard the Goethe House!\" The Foreign Minister, Dr. Adolf Köster, in a note to the Allied governments wrote: \"if we should suffer from the occupation, we will accept the inferior discipline...among your white troops if only you we will rid us of this black plague!\" \n\nMorel had published in the left-wing newspaper \"The Daily Herald\" on 10 April his \"indictment of the colored outrages\" in the Rhineland, which attracted much attention. Morel wrote about the Senegalese soldiers that during the First World War \"primitive African barbarians...stuffed their haversacks with eye-balls, ears and heads of the foe\". Morel went on to write about \"barely restrainable bestiality of the black troops\" and depicted the Senegalese in the Rhineland as engaging in a reign of terror against German civilians, raping and killing without mercy. In an appeal to his female readers, Morel asked the question: \"is there no obligation laid upon womenhood as such, in a matter of this kind which goes to the very root of any decent instinct the war may have left alive among the white peoples of the earth?\" Morel wrote that \"black savages\" have uncontrolled sexual impulses that \"must be satisfied upon the bodies of white women!\" (emphasis in the original). Despite his claim not to hate black people, Morel wrote: \"There they [the African soldiers] have become a terror and a horror unimaginable to the countryside, raping girls and women-for well known physiological reasons, the raping of a white woman by a negro is nearly always accompanied by serious injuries and not infrequently has fatal results; spreading syphilis, murdering inoffensive civilians, often getting completely out of control; the terrible barbaric incarnation of a barbarous policy, embodied in a so-called peace treaty which puts the clock back 2, 000 years\".\n\nIn a leader (editorial) written by the editor of \"The Daily Herald\", George Lansbury, approved of Morel's article and asked that France pull all African troops out of the Rhineland at once. On 12 April 1920, Lansbury wrote again on the subject, saying if the French did not sent the Senegalese back to Africa at once, \"we shall have savages used to blackleg, and to coerce, the workers of all European countries\". On the same day, \"The Daily Herald\"'s headlines read: \"Brutes in French Uniforms Danger to German women from 30, 000 Blacks Brothels not enough\". The Central Committee of Women's Co-operative Guild in a statement expressed its \"horror and indignation\" at the use of Senegalese troops in the Rhineland, asked the British government pressure the French government to send all African troops back to Africa and called for an international agreement to ban \"the use of any native African troops by any European power\". On 27 April 1920, a mass protest meeting was held in London that was organised jointly by all of the main British feminist groups, namely the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, the National Federation of Women Workers, the Federation of Women Teachers, the Women's Co-operative Guild, the Association of Women Clerks and Secretaries and the Fabian Women's Group to condemn France for the alleged war crimes committed by the Senegalese. At the meeting, Morel asked: that in the interests of good feeling between all the races of the world and the security of all women, this\nmeeting calls upon the League of Nations to prohibit the importation into Europe for warlike purposes of troops belonging to primitive peoples.\"\n\nClaude McKay, the Jamaican writer and industrial unionist who had arrived in London several months earlier, wrote a letter to \"The Daily Herald\", which was not published, asking:\"Why this obscene maniacal outburst about the sex vitality of black men in a proletarian paper?\" Rape is rape; the colour of the skin doesn't make it different. Negroes are no more over-sexed than Caucasians; mulatto children in the West Indies and America were not the result of parthenogenesis. If Negro troops had syphilis, they contracted it from the white and yellow races. As for German women, in their economic plight they were selling themselves to anyone. I do not protest because I happen to be a Negro...I write because I feel that the ultimate result of your propaganda will be further strife and blood-spilling between whites and the many members of my race...who have been dumped down on the English docks since the ending of the European war...Bourbons of the United States will thank you, and the proletarian underworld of London will certainly gloat over the scoop of the Christian-Socialist pacifist \"Daily Herald\". Another letter to the editor of \"The Daily Herald\" which was published on 17 April 1920 came from the africanist Norman Leys and criticized Morel for \"his so-called physiological facts\", which are \"one of the great sources for racial hatred and should never be given currency\".'\n\nMorel's article received much attention and 50, 000 Swedish women signed a petition which was presented at the French Embassy in Stockholm asking the French to withdraw their \"savage\" Senegalese soldiers from the Rhineland. In an article in \"The Labour Leader\" on 22 April 1920, Morel wrote the African soldiers were the \"passively obedient instrument of capitalist society\" and a threat to the working classes of the nations of Europe. Reflecting his opposition to the Treaty of Versailles, Morel blamed the \"black horror\" on the French who deliberately committed this \"supreme outrage\" of sending these \"tens of thousands of savage men\" to the Rhineland. Morel predicated the \"black horror\" would cause another world war, writing that the average German boy was thinking: \"Boys these men raped your mothers and sisters\" (emphasis in the original) . General C.B. Thomson of the British Army published an article in \"The Daily Herald\", which stated that based on his extensive service in Africa, that he knew about the \"sexual proclivities\" of Africans \"who in default of their own race must have intercourse with European women\". General Thomson denounced France for training \"these savages\" who are \"being taught to despise the European races\". On 14 April 1920, a Labour MP, Josiah Wedgwood, stated in the House of Commons that his party \"did not consider Senegalese proper troops to garrison German towns\" and asked the government to apply pressure on France to pull out the Senegalese. In the spring and summer of 1920, Labour MPs repeatedly raised the issue of the \"black horror\" in the Rhineland and demanded the government do something to force the French to pull out their African soldiers. In September 1920 at a meeting of the Trade Union Congress, free copies of Morel's pamphlet \"The Horror on the Rhine\" were handed to the delegates so that they learn about the \"injustices\" of Versailles and the \"horrors\" faced by the working class of the Rhineland.\n\nOn 30 April 1920, the left-wing Vancouver newspaper, the \"British Columbia Federationist\" ran a front-paper cover story \"The Black Scourge Is Now Ravaging Europe\". The article began that the following story \"was a revelation so horrible that only the strongest sense that it is our duty to let the public know what is being done would induce use to publish it\". On 10 May 1920, the Prime Minister of Sweden, Hjalmar Branting, declared in a speech his belief in the truth of Morel's claims, saying that as a white man he was outraged that the French would deploy Senegalese troops in the Rhineland. In August 1920, Morel first used the phrase \"the black horror on the Rhine\" in one of his pamphlets to describe the alleged atrocities. In the United States, so many letters had been received by outraged citizens that President Wilson in June 1920 asked Secretary of State Bainbridge Colby, to have the American ambassador in Paris, Hugh Campbell Wallace, to investigate these stories. General Henry T. Allen, the commander of the American occupation force in Coblenz together with the diplomat E.L. Dresel carried out an investigation and reported on 25 June 1920 that almost all of the stories about the \"black horror on the Rhine\" were baseless. Dresel wrote nearly all of the stories about atrocities were untrue and General Allen praised the \"good discipline\" of the Senegalese. Both men concluded that the stories about the \"black horror on the Rhine\" were being made to influence U.S. public opinion. After the Red Summer of 1919, which had seen widespread race riots across the United States causing hundreds of deaths, most of them African-American, white American public opinion was very sensitive to stories about \"uppity\" blacks getting out of hand, and was inclined to sympathize with those who claimed to be threatened by blacks. The U.S. government did not chose to make these reports public at the time.\n\nA reporter for \"The Nation\", Lewis Gannett, who went to the Rhineland to investigate the allegations found them to be mostly false. Gannett found that there had been cases of rape of German women and girls by the Senegalese, but the total number was far smaller than what had been alleged by Morel; that white French troops had also raped German women, a matter that did not interest Morel very much; and that in rape cases \"the French have inflicted severe punishment upon all soldiers guilty of transgressing against the civil population\". A study done by the British journalist J. Ellis Baker in published in July 1921 edition of \"Current History\" found that between 1918-1921 that there had been a total of 72 creditable allegations of criminal conduct made against \"colored troops\" in the Rhineland, and of which only 9 concerned allegations of rape. Baker's study also listed 96 allegations of criminal conduct which had been judged \"doubtful\" and 59 which were found to be \"unjustified\". The German journalist Maximilian Harden wrote that the sex between \"colored\" soldiers in the French Army and German women in the Rhineland was mostly consensual, writing: \"German women were chiefly responsible for the mingling of colored and white blood which has taken place by the Rhine\".\n\nThe German historian Christian Koller in an exhaustive study of complaints made by the Rhinelanders against \"colored\" French occupation forces found that most of the complaints were of a petty nature, such as playing unauthorized football games in parks. Most of the complaints about violence by \"colored\" soldiers in Worms involved Moroccans, usually brawls in the streets, and Koller found that complaints about sexual violence from the Senegelese were \"rare\" with the mayor of Worms actually wanting the \"well disciplined\" Senegalese to stay rather than be replaced by the more combative Moroccans. In Wiesbaden, relations between the Rhinelanders and the French occupation forces were more tense with references to brawls, property damage and \"four cases of death caused by the colored troops\", which was less than those that white French troops were accused of. Koller also noted the vague nature of the \"black horror\" claims and that when it came to specifics, many of the claims of rape by the Senegalese have a \"sameness\" to not only the accounts of the alleged rapes, but even the same words and phrasing, which led Koller to conclude that the accounts were almost certainly fabricated. On the whole, Koller found that there were isolated cases of rape by \"colored\" soldiers, but there was nothing to support the claim of a reign of terror in the Rhineland by \"colored\" forces. The historian Raffael Scheck wrote most German newspapers outside of the Rhineland ran the \"Black Horror\" stories, but in fact it seems that relations between the \"colored\" troops and the Rhinelanders were \"mostly friendly, sometimes \"too\" friendly for the critics\" as some Rhenish women gave birth to illegitimate children with African, Berber, Arab and Asian features known by the disparaging term, the Rhineland Bastards.\n\nIn the summer of 1920, Morel visited the Rhineland to investigate the matter himself, and in August 1920, he published his pamphlet \"The Horror on the Rhine\". Within a month, all 5, 000 copies of \"The Horror on the Rhine\" had sold out and by April 1921 there had been 8 editions of \"The Horror on the Rhine\". The third edition of \"The Horror on the Rhine\" featured endorsed by the former German chancellor Prince Max of Baden; Jean Longuet of the French Socialist Party; four Socialist members of the Italian parliament; and General C. B. Thomson. In \"The Horror on the Rhine\", Morel wrote about black men having an uncontrolled, fierce sexuality that made them want to rape white women. Morel wrote: \"In ones or twos, sometimes in parties, big, stewart men from the warmer climes, armed with sword-bayonets or knives, sometimes with revolvers, living unnatural lives of restraint, their fierce passions hot within them, roam the countryside\". The African-American philosopher Alain LeRoy Locke visited the Rhineland to investigate Morel's claims and found them mostly baseless. Locke also interviewed the soldiers of the French Army, which he praised as a multi-racial force when skin color did not matter, and stated the morale of the Senegalese was holding up well.\n\nThe claims made by the German government did influence American public opinion. Dudley Field Malone, the leader of the Farmer–Labor Party, wrote to President Wilson that: \"thoughtful persons in America and throughout the world are horrified by the victimization of German women and girls by half-savage African troops\". The French writer Romain Rolland issued a statement approving of Morel's articles and declared: \"The incredible blindness of statesmen who without realizing it are turning Europe over to the black and yellow continents, which they are armed with their own hands, is itself the unconscious instrument of Destiny\". Lothrop Stoddard, a professor at Harvard, an avowed white supremacist and eugenist, had just published his best-selling book \"The Rising Tide of Color Against World-wide White Supremacy\", warning of a black-Asian threat to the \"white races\". Upon reading Morel's \"The Horror on the Rhine\", Stoddard promptly issued his approval, warning of the \"extreme fecundity\" of blacks and that \"black blood, once entering a human stock, seems never to really bred out again\". In October 1920, a debate took place at a conference of Protestant clergymen at the World Ecumenical Conference in Geneva, when a Lutheran pastor from Germany asked the conference to condemn the \"black horror\". The African-American Reverend John R. Hawkins, representing the African Methodist Episcopal church from Washington D.C. said in response: \"\"It was most unfortunate...he should take occasion to drag into this place for high and lofty sentiments the slime and venom of the monster, colour prejudice...Crimes committed by soldiers drunk with the feeling of resentment and the passions of bloody battles have followed all wars; there is no reason for making this invidious distinction and holding up the coloured troops alone to be guilty of such atrocities...The dusky sons of Ham, whether from Africa or America, have come to Europe are among the bravest of the brave and the noblest of the noble, and I will not be silent while their record is attacked.\"\n\nThe \"Christian Science Monitor\" in an editorial on 28 October 1920 wrote: \"France has gone even further than an eye-for-eye and has outplayed Germany at its worse, in a way so terrible that it is impossible to indulge in details\". Two weeks later, the \"Christian Science Monitor\" (CSM) retracted the editorial after receiving a letter from the French consul in Koblenz who showed that the total number of Senegalese in the Rhineland were 5 000, not the 50, 000 alleged by the \"Christian Science Monitor\"; that there had been a total of 13 reported cases of rape of German women by the Senegalese, not the thousands alleged by the CSM; and that in all 13 cases, the rapists had been sentenced to death after being convicted with the consul noting sharply that the French Army did not tolerate rapists in its ranks. The \"Auswärtige Amt\" seeing that the stories about the \"black horror on the Rhine\" were effective in gaining international sympathy for the \"Reich\" greatly increased its propaganda with pamphlets detailing the alleged war crimes committed by the Senegalese being published in English, Dutch, French, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese. The \"Auswärtige Amt\" attached so importance to the promoting the \"Black Horror on the Rhine\" stories that the German embassies in Lima and Santiago were ordered to make publicizing \"Die schwarze Schand\" their main priority. Nelson described the pamphlets handed out by the German diplomats-some of which were written by \"cranks\" and which verged on the pornographic in their depiction of fair German girls being raped by brutish Africans-as presenting a long list of rapes said to be committed by the Senegalese against German women and girls on the orders of their French officers. In 1921, a film was produced in Munich about the \"black horror on the Rhine\" that played all over Germany and in the Netherlands. In June 1921, Beveridge gave a speech at the Sagebiel Hall in Hamburg attended by some 50, 000 people during she accused the Senegalese of raping thousands of German women and girls since they had arrived in the Rhineland.\n\nMuch of the fury that the \"colored\" troops generated in Germany was due to the way that they inverted the normal racial hierarchy with black, brown and Asian men holding power over white Germans. A recurring theme of German complaints against the Senegalese was that Germany had now been \"colonized\" by Africans. A German writer, Alfred von Wrochem, in his best-selling book \"The Colonization of the Rhineland by France\" had attacked the French for undermining belief in worldwide white supremacy by using Senegalese troops. During World War I, the presence of Africans fighting in the French Army had in the word of the British historian Barbara Bush had made \"trans-racial sex between white women and black men of all classes an obsession with white men\". The stationing of Senegalese troops in the Rhineland had tapped into these fears. The British ambassador to Germany, Lord D'Abederon wrote: \"The war increased the German's respect for, and his dislike of the English, but has done nothing to diminish his belief in his own superior sturdiness compared with the French. This will continue subconsciously and subcutaneously whatever happens-even though France possesses an overpowering army and the Germans have no organised means of resistance\". A theme of much the \"black horror\" propaganda was that of a massive contempt for the French who had to use \"colored\" troops to fight their wars. One of the leading \"black horror\" propagandists, August Ritter von Eberlein, wrote: \"Without her colored troops, France is not in a position in the present tense situation to maintain her militarism and imperialism\".\n\nThe fear of sexuality of black men was especially felt very strongly by white feminists and throughout the 1920s, feminist publications in the United States and the United Kingdom presented the \"black horror on the Rhine\" stories as true. An interesting exception was when \"The British Columbia Federationist\" ran an article in October 1920 titled \"France Creates Hell West of the Rhine\", accusing the Senegalese soldiers of committing \"numberless outrages against women and girls\". The Canadian historian Peter Campbell noted that the \"fascinating aspect\" was that there were no letters to the editor of the \"British Columbia Federationist\" expressing either approval or disapproval; which he noted was odd given the way in which the article appealed to the prejudices in the most base way, suggesting that the largely white, working-class readers of \"British Columbia Federationist\" did not approve of the anti-black message. In France, a French Socialist Charles Gide wrote on 16 March 1921 edition of the newspaper \"Foi et Vie\" that Morel claimed that he wanted to protect the Africans, but: \"\"le genre de protection de M. Morel rappelle un peu le precepte que fait afficher la Society protectrice des animaux: 'Soyez bons pour les betes\"'\" (Mr. Morel's kind of protection is a little reminiscent of the precepts of the Society for the Protection of Animals: 'Be good to the animals').\n\nOne group founded in Munich in September 1921 to campaign against the \"black horror\" was the \"Notbund\" led by Heinrich Distler. Known for its enthusiastic hyperbole and its usually false claims, the \"Notbund\"'s pamphlets claimed the Senegalese were raping 100 women/per day in the Rhineland and the Malagasy had caused epidemics of tuberculosis, dysentery, syphilis, malaria, Malta fever, leprosy, Phagedänismus and parasitic worms in the Rhineland. Appealing to the medical ignorance of its readers, the \"Notbund\" maintained that it was possible to contract leprosy solely by being in the presence of a black man without even touching him. In Britain, Norman Angell in his 1921 book \"The Fruits of Victory\" wrote the worse aspect of the Treaty of Versailles was the stationing of the Senegalese in the Rhineland. Angell accused the French of putting \"cannibals from the African forests\" into the \"cultured\" university towns of the Rhineland.\n\nThe motivations of the \"black horror\" writers differed greatly. The German sociologist Iris Wigger divided the writers into two types; a \"liberal racism\" that embraced writers such as E.D Morel and the former Italian Prime Minister Francesco Saverio Nitti who used the \"black horror\" stories primarily as a weapon for attacking the Treaty of Versailles, and a \"conservative racism\" that embraced figures such as the German writer Guido Kreutzer and the American actress Ray Beveridge mainly found within in Germany that used the \"black horror\" stories primarily as a weapon for attacking the Weimar Republic.\n\nIn Morel's own mind, he was an anti-racist who was fighting for the Africans. Morel believed that Africans were far closer to nature than Europeans and as such, the Africans had “the uneducated soul of the savage” and were not up to the demands of modern industrial society. As such, Morel believed that blacks being creatures of \"strong emotions\" needed to be protected from \"modern civilization\" which they were allegedly not capable of handling, which explained his campaigning against the Congo Free State which tried to bring modern work discipline to the Congo in the early 20th century. At the same time, Morel believed that Africans, lacking the self-discipline of whites, had an uncontrolled sexuality. In a 1911 essay after visiting Nigeria, Morel had written the \"reproduction\" of the black race was the main \"obsession\" of all black people, writing about the \"instinctive and mysterious\" call of racial need which supposedly made all black people obsessed with sex all the time to the exclusion of everything else, declaring that \"sexual obsession\" was the \"elementary racial desire\" of black people. In this viewpoint, as long as Africans were left in their \"natural savage state\", all would be well as Africans were not capable of meeting the sexual self-discipline of Europeans, which is why Morel condemned the efforts of missionaries in Africa. Through Morel had been very forceful in condemning the cruel exploitation of the Congo Free State, Morel believed in imperialism, just not the cruel exploitative imperialism of the Congo Company, writing it was the duty of whites to serve as the \"trustees\" for blacks and the \"great white father\" who would protect the \"basic human rights\" of Africans while at the same time accepting the \"infantile\" nature of black people who not the equal in any way of whites. \nMorel was very anti-French not only because of his opposition to the Treaty of Versailles, but because of the nature of France's \"mission civilisatrice\" (\"civilizing mission\") in Africa whereby any African who was willing to embrace the French language and culture would become French and theoretically the equal of whites threatened to upend Morel's beliefs in the essential biological inferiority of blacks. Morel believed that the Africans were committing outrageous crimes against Germans in the Rhineland because the French had empowered them by least theoretically making them into black Frenchmen who were just as much citizens of the republic as anyone else. Precisely because Morel believed in the uncontrolled sexuality of blacks, it was self-evident to him that the \"sexually uncontrolled and uncontrollable\" Senegalese would run amok in the Rhineland, raping every German female in sight. As part of his call for international solidarity with a Germany alleged to be victimized by the Treaty of Versailles, Morel wrote: ‘For the working classes the importation of Negro mercenaries by the hundred thousand from the heart of Africa, to fight the battles and execute the lusts of capitalist governments in the heart of Europe is...a terrifc portent. The workers, alike in Britain, France, and Italy will be ill-advised if they allow it to pass in silence because today the victims happen to be German.” Morel used the alleged massive sexual violence committed against women in the Rhineland as a call for racial togetherness, writing it was in the interests of all white peoples to assist Germany with revising the terms of Versailles which permitted the \"black horror on the Rhine\". In the same way, Morel used the \"black horror\" as a way of attacking France which had caused a “sexual horror on the Rhine” and whose “reign of terror” was a “giant evil” that should inspire “shame into all four corners of the world” and ultimately should “a revision of the Versailles Treaty and the relief for Germany.”\n\nNitti, a liberal Italian politician was known for his calls for an \"United States of Europe\", believing that only when all of the nations of Europe become one would all of the problems of modern Europe be solved. In this regard, Nitti was strongly opposed to the Treaty of Versailles, which he called the \"instrument of oppression\" against Germany, the \"most cultured nation\" in the world. As part of his critique of Versailles, Nitti wrote that the French had put the most \"backward nations\" in the Rhineland, declaring some of the \"most cultured cities in Europe\" that been subjected to \"Negro violence\" and to \"physical and moral trials unknown for centuries in civilized countries\". Nitti wrote the occupation of the Rhineland \"had no military aim\" but rather was an \"attempt to force Germany to the point of moral exhaustion\". At the same time, Nitti, who was very well worried about the prospect of a Communist revolution in Germany, used the \"black horror\" stories as a way of creating unity in Germany, urging that all Germans regardless of class should unite in the common struggle against France. As part of his call for European unity, Nitti went out of his way to portray France's African soldiers as an alien body that did not belong in Europe at all, which allowed him to condemn France as the nation responsible for this state of affairs. Nitti wrote the Senegalese were guilty of \"any form of violence and crime\" as their \"yesterday the representatives of cannibalistic races\" whom were now occupying the \"country of the greatest thinkers in Europe\". Throughout his speeches and essays, Nitti drew a contrast between Europeans who constituted civilization vs Africans who represented barbarism. Nitti even so far as to say he was shocked to see and hear \"music gangs of Negroes and Berbers of Africa\" play \"African music programmes\" on the \"squares of the occupied cities\". Nitti wrote for him it \"seemed unbearable\" that Germans whose nation was a \"cradle of musical genius\" to listen to \"Negro music\". As part of his call to revise Versailles, Nitti urged that the other European nations together with the United States were under the obligation to \"save culture...from the flood of barbarism\" as \"Germany's fall\" would mean \"the downfall of one the largest driving forces of humanity\". As part of his demand for a pan-Western effort to save Germany, Nitti wrote he could hear the “cry of pain of the German woman\", which he wrote was a “most terrible accusation against Christian peoples,” who called themselves “civilized and democratic.”\n\nWigger stated that writers on both sides were equally racist, but there was a difference between those as Morel and Nitti whose main interest was in revising the terms of Versailles in Germany's favor, and those like Kreutzer and Beveridge whose main interest was in proving the Weimar Republic was too \"weak\" to stand up to France. The same conclusion was reached by the British historian Peter Collar who wrote: \"...there existed in Germany a fundamental disagreement over the value of propaganda and the use to which it might be put. To the idealists of the new Republic it offered a way for Germany to advance her cause abroad in the widest sense and to get away from the excesses of the Wilhelmine era...The Right saw things quite differently. In the far Right, exemplified in party political terms by the DNVP and by some within the Bavarian BVP, there existed a deep desire to return to past authoritarian certainty, a past that was idealised in the imaginaton. The concepts behind the new Republic were totally alien and were to be opposed at every opportunity.\" The campaign against the \"black horror\" was not one campaign coordinated by the \"Reich\" government, but several different campaigns launched by the \"Reich\", Bavarian, and Prussian governments together with a number of private groups. With the notable exceptions of the Communists and Independent Social Democrats, every political group in Germany endorsed the \"black horror\" campaign thought Collar described the Majority Social Democratic Party of Germany more as \"fellow travelers in the propaganda war rather than a driving force\". Racism was so pervasive in Europe at the time that the \"black or colored man was generally considered by the white European to be his inferior\".\n\nRay Beveridge, a conservative Germanophile American actress and an ardent racist who was of the leading speakers on the subject, used the \"black horror\" as a call for a right-wing \"Volksgemeinschaft\" (\"people's community\"), urging the German people to reject the Weimar republic and rally around the \"völkisch\" right, which she claimed were the only men capable of \"standing up\" to France. Beveridge was well known for her exaggerated claims and a speaking style that sought to appeal to the worse prejudices in her audience, often spoke about the \"mindless blacks\" with \"enormous sex drives and unrestrained passion\" who allegedly would attack \"white women, white girls, white youth, often old people and even children\". Beveridge usually began her speeches with the remark:\"Why do I come here, an American, to speak to you about the \"Schwarze Schmach\"? Because I come from a nation that ever since it came into being has been threatened by black and yellow problems and the black and yellow peril!...I appeal to women in the world! I appeal to all men worthy of the name. Help! White women, white boys are in danger everyday, every hour of the day as long as a black is allowed to have power over a white women!\" An avowed white supremacist, Beveridge sought to impute the worse about black men, saying in one speech:\"Victims of the promiscuous passions of the blacks are found half dead in meadows and ditches, their clothes in tatters, their delicate young bodies torn by the brutality of the attacks. Many have bite wounds which show clearly how wildly the black beast has fallen on his victim. I could quote innumerable examples with names and dates; and it must not be forgotten that almost all these men are infected with venereal diseases\".\"\n\nBeveridge's speeches were well attended and are described in contemporary newspaper reports as being greeted with huge applause, but others involved in the \"black horror\" campaign like Margarete Gärtner, the chairwoman of the \"Rheinische Frauenliga\", regarded Beveridge as a liability as she was prone to making exaggerated and false claims in her speeches that were easily rebutted by the French. The \"Auswärtige Amt\" in a report stated that Beveridge was harming the German side as she \"outdoes the \"Notbund\" in her hysterical extremes\". Collar called Beveridge the most extreme of all the speakers on the theme of the \"black horror\", describing her as the preferred spokeswoman of the \"extreme right\" in Germany with her speeches being \"nothing less than an incitement to racial hatred\". In one of her speeches, Beveridge said: \"Your weapons have been taken from you, but there still remains a rope and a tree. Take up the natural arms which our men from the South resort: lynch! Hang every black who assaults a white person!\" However, Collar wrote that Beveridge who was fluent in German was a \"charismatic orator...able to whip up her audience into a frenzy\". Linking all this together was Bevridge's call for the \"Volksgemeinschaft\", saying that the \"German spirit, the German science, the German culture, and the German work\" were more than enough to defeat France, provided that all Germans stand \"faithfully together\" and put the nation ahead of \"party politics\". In a speech in a Munich beerhall, Beveridge declared: \"Germans unite-unity is power-only with power can you shake the chains of Versailles!\".\n\nAs part of her appeal, Beveridge spoke the need to keep the \"Volkskörper\" (the collective \"racial body\" of the German people) pure, and as such German women as the bearers of the next generation of Germans had the most important part of the \"Volkskörper\". In Beveridge's mind, the alleged sexual crimes against German women were bad enough, but even worse by threatening the \"Volkskörper\" threatened the very existence of the German \"race\". For Beveridge, the purity of the \"Volkskörper\" was so important that any man who did not fight against the \"black horror\" was not only a “slacker” and “traitor of his country”, but also a “traitor against the white race.” Beveridge often spoke of her \"shame\" for the “German race” who was not willing “to protect” the “honour” of his women from the \"Fremdkörper\" (alien body) that was now threatening the \"Volkskörper\" in the Rhineland. At the time of the Munich Beerhall \"putsch\", Beveridge came out in support for the National Socialists, declaring it “an enormous honor” to mobilise, together with her German husband, “the \"Chiemgau\" for Adolf Hitler”. At the time, Beveridge had said in a speech that Hitler together with General Erich Ludendorff were her “German heroes”. Beveridge later on in the 1930s renounced her U.S. citizenship to become a German citizen, joined the NSDAP, and was a well known \"admirer of Hitler\".\"\n\nLikewise, the \"völkisch\" German writer Guido Kreutzer used the \"black horror on the Rhine\" as a way of attacking both what he saw as the \"unjust\" Treaty of Versailles and even more so the Weimar Republic, which was too \"weak\" to stand up to France. In his very popular 1921 novel \"Die Schwarze Schmach: Der Roman des geschändeten Deutschlands\" (\"The Black Shame A Novel of Disgraced Germany\"), Kreutzer portrayed the Senegalese and Moroccan soldiers as thuggish rapists who violate thousands upon thousands of innocent German girls in the Rhineland, who have all the stereotypical \"Aryan\" look with fair skin, blonde hair and blue eyes; the hero of the novel repeatedly calls the Senegalese \"nigger scum\". The preface to \"Die Schwarze Schmach\" was written by the \"völkisch\" activist Count Ernst zu Reventlow whom praised the novel as a much needed call for the \"Volksgemeinschaft\". Reventlow wrote that Jesus Christ had taught all Christians to love their neighbor, which he took to mean all Germans should love the Rhinelanders and hate the French, writing: \"It is this national hatred that we need! It must pulsate evenly throughout the German people, uniting them and driving them forward. This hatred of an entire people, despite a lack of weapons, will build an insuperable force and, from a certain moment in time, an irresistible one. It must act everywhere and at every moment against the French interloper. In the long term, no conqueror has ever been able to withstand such hatred and at this time in Germany the conqueror is not even there by virtue of his own power.\" In this regard, Reventlow complained that the German people were far too disunited at present, and needed to become united by hating the French, which was why he recommended reading the novel.\n\nKreutzer used \"Die Schwarze Schmach\" as a way of attacking the Weimar Republic which is portrayed as a weak and ineffective in face of the \"black horror on the Rhine\", and called for Germans to embrace a \"strongman\" leader who would rule as a dictator. The cover of \"Die Schwarze Schmach\" featured an ape-like black man wearing the uniform of a French Army private holding a half-naked white woman with a lascivious expression on his face. The hero of the novel is Baron von Yrsch, an aristocrat, former Prussian Army general, war hero and a friend of the former Emperor Wilhelm II who lives on his estate outside of an unnamed town in the Rhineland together with his beautiful daughter, whom the Senegalese naturally want to rape. Yrsch complains about the weak Emperor who abdicated and left into exile while leaving his 70 million loyal subjects \"in the abyss\". Reflecting his nationalistic views, Kreutzer has a French officer say: \"The German Army was the moral victor. Only numerical superiority and hunger had finally forced it to its knees. France by itself would have been overrun by Germany in less than four weeks without being able to offer any serious resistance\". To humiliate Yrsch, the French demand they be allowed to open a brothel on the grounds of his estate to be operated by his daughter Marlene. The Moroccans serving in the French Army are described as having \"a rough-hewn black-brown face; bulging yellowish eyes buried deep under the forehead beneath the steel helmet; the predator teeth dazzlingly bright between the burning red lips\".\n\nAnother supporting character is Lampré, the son of a Rhineland industrialist and a Rhenish separatist whom initially collaborates with the French, but sees the error of his ways when confronted with the \"black horror\" and in the climax of the novel saves Yrsch's daughter from being raped by a \"mulatto\" French Army officer by killing him. When the collaborating mayor orders Yrsch out of the town, thousands of the \"Burschenschaften\" (student fraternities) join forces with the town's workers in a demonstration to persuade him to stay. The villain of the novel is the \"mulatto\" Captain Mustapha Hassan of the French Army; the fact that \"half-Arabian\" Hassan is a Muslim, the self-proclaimed \"black raven of Allah\", who is a descendant of Muslim warriors who fought against the Crusades was meant by Kreutzer to show that France is not longer a \"civilized\" European Christian nation, but has rather become a \"mulatto\" nation that has rejected the values of the European family of nations. In an important symbolic moment, when Captain Hassan tries to rape Yrsch's daughter and Lampré comes to her defense, Hassan's white chauffeur fires a shot at him with his revolver that instead shoots off a finger of a statue of Christ in front of a church, thereby showing the French have turned their backs on Christian Europe. In another important scene, Lampré confronts his Rhenish separatist father to tell him that he \"wants to be German again\" rather than associate with the \"niggers\" of France. Lampré's industrialist father is portrayed as blinded by greed and he has to decided to support Rhenish separatism out of the potential to make millions from working with the French. Ultimately, Lampré's father sees the error of his ways and he too rediscovers his pride in being German again. The Lamprés \"pere\" and \"fils\" represent the elegantly cosmopolitan and Francophile Catholic middle classes of the Rhineland who often resented Prussian militarism as crude and overbearing, seeing themselves as a more civilized type of German.\n\nKreutzer also used \"Die Schwarze Schmach\" as a way of reinforcing traditional gender roles as German women are portrayed as a weak and passive, unable to protect themselves from the rampaging Senegalese and Moroccans, needing the \"manly\" German men to protect them. Using \"völkisch\" language, Kreutzer called for all Germans to feel for their \"tormented \"volksgenossen\"\" (national comrades) in the Rhineland, rediscover their \"national source of strength\" by uniting against the common foe, and allow \"the \"völkisch\" spark to spread\". In the novel, the bodies of German women represent both literally and symbolically the tormented German nation attacked by African \"savages\" with the female body serving as a symbol of German racial purity. Significantly, the children born to German mothers and Senegalese fathers are all born \"physically and morally degenerate\" and are not considered to be German. Furthermore, all of the women raped are by the Senegalese cease to be German the moment they are raped, and it is made clear that there is no place in the \"Volksgemeinschaft\" for them. Kreutzer accuses France of seeking to \"undermine the nation's health\" by allowing African soldiers to \"rape and defile\" German women, who are portrayed as virtuous, wholesome and chaste symbols of German racial purity, blessed with the sacred task of bearing the next generation of Germans.\n\nLampré rejects his French lover, a licentious dancer and a \"worldly little animal\" whose \"soulless chirping voices\" and overt sexuality he finds repulsive for the more wholesome and German figure of Marlene von Yrsch. Marlene von Yrsch is blessed with all the beauty of her \"race\", having a \"girly pristine charm\", blonde hair worn in a \"Greek node\", \"wise eyes\", an \"elegantly narrow face\" with beautiful \"curved brows\" and a \"slim shape\" to her body. Marlene von Yrsch is a symbol of not only Germany, but also of the white race in general, marking out the all that was beautiful in the world vs. the hideously deformed bodies of the Senegalese, Moroccan and Vietnamese soldiers serving in the French Army. The mere sight of her causes Lampré to desert from the French Foreign Legion as he sees in her a \"woe reminder of the fatherland lost forever\" as his mind is flooded with images of his lost \"Heimat\", filling him with \"shame\" for having fought for France. By contrast, Captain Mustapha Hassan is portrayed as a sexual predator with \"primitively carved features\" and a \"brutal\" sexuality, an ugly man with beady lips who \"bites like an animal\" at the sight of Marlene. When Marlene rejects his advances, calling him a \"half-civilized savage\" with \"all the arrogance of her race\", he becomes obsessed with raping her in revenge. Lampré vows to protect Marlene, saying she will not be \"fair game for this nigger\", saying his \"conscience as a human being and a man\" will not let do otherwise and thereby redeems himself for his \"treason\" for having fought for France in the Foreign Legion.\n\nFinally, Kreutzer used \"Die Schwarze Schmach\" as a way of attacking the Social Democrats as group of working class characters in the Rhineland in the novel ultimately abandoned the SPD as they find it is only right-wing leaders like Yrsch who can create the \"Volksgemeinschaft\" that will allow Germany to stand up to France. Reflecting Kreutzer's conservative politics, in \"Die Schwarze Schmach\", the working class characters finally learn the SPD is a divisive force that weakens the German people by dividing the working class from the rest of the German people, and it is when the Rhenish working class learn to accept leadership from traditional elites such as the aristocracy and the industrialists that the German people can finally be united as one in the form of the \"Volksgemeinschaft\" to stand up to France, Germany's ancient archenemy which was responsible for the \"black horror on the Rhine\". In the novel, the working class march under the \"old black-white-red flags\" to protest the \"black horror\" and the expulsion order against the \"national hero\" Yrsch; in Germany the colors red, white and black symbolize the right while the colors red, black and gold symbolize the left. In one scene, a delegation of workers led by a huge union official respectfully pay a visit to Yrsch's estate to ask him to lead them on a struggle against the French, which was Kreutzer's way of showing that Germans needed to defer to their traditional elites to become great again. In paternal relationship, aristocrats like Yrsch understand the problems of the working class, and argue for fair treatment of the workers by their employers, which was Kreutzer's way of saying that in the \"Volksgemeinschaft\" the German people would all be united together as a one big happy family. The novel repeatedly hammers home the point that only if the German people are united as one in the form of the \"Volksgemeinschaft\" can Germany recover from the defeat of 1918, and throughout the novel Germans are of all classes are seen as victimized by the French and their \"colored\" troops. Wigger suggested that Kreutzer was using his racism as a way of uniting all Germans together as the working class characters find the question of racial purity more important than their wages, working conditions and standards of living, and at one point a union official says that every working-class family must be opposed to \"mad strikes and Communist agitations\" that weaken the unity of the German nation. In this regard, when the union leaders rebuke Lampré's father for his treasonous activities, he ceases to be an \"exploitative\" capitalist and turns into a \"good German capitalist\", having a very paternal relationship with his workers whom he takes care of and in their return defer to him.\n\nAt the end of the novel, Lampré marries Marlene and becomes a killing machine, saying no-one will ever threaten his \"German sanctuary again\", and his \"soul is finally at peace\" as he takes up the task of killing Senegalese and Moroccans with gusto. He and his bride enjoy a brief moment of happiness as they \"raved and kissed\" by the banks of the river Rhine and sing the song \"Lovers by the Rhine\"; subsequently an attempt to escape the Rhineland ends with Marlene being killed while Lampré who once rejected German nationalism sees it is too late for him and that his \"treason\" for having served France can never be fully redeemed. Collar wrote that in Kreutzer's novel, the \"Black Horror\" was \"...almost subsidiary in his eyes to a bigger issue-the simple fact that Germany had lost the war. The book was simply the expression of his resentment and fury...The tenor of the book leaves little doubt that it reflected the views of the extreme right-wing \"völkisch\" circles, for whom defeat had come as a crushing blow and for whom the new Republic was an abomination. For them the \"Schwarze Schmach\" was clearly but one element in the array of grievances against France. Incitement of public hatred leading to a war of revenge in the indefinite future was much in evidence\".\n\nIn response to stories about the \"black horror on the Rhine\", the French government published pamphlets settling to rebut the \"calumnies\" while several French newspapers in editorials accused the Germans of engaging in racism. In 1921 the French government published a pamphlet \"La campagne contre les troupes noires\", defending the Senegalese and pointing out inaccuracies in the articles by Morel and Beveridge's speeches, for instance, stating that 50, 000 Senegalese had not been stationed in the Rhineland with the total number of \"colored\" troops in the Rhineland numbering 25, 000, of which 4, 00 were Senegalese. The pamphlet also quoted from German newspapers such as \"Sozialistische Republik\", \"Der Christliche Pilger\" and \"Deutsche pazifistische Monatsschrift\", which all ran stories testifying to the good behavior of the \"colored\" troops. In Paris, the \"Comité d'Assistance aux Troupes Noires\" was founded to defend the reputation of the Senegalese. French Army doctors published statistics showing that there was not an abnormally high rate of sybills among the Senegalese and the German claim that the Africans had brought sleeping sickness to the Rhineland could not be true as none of the Senegalese stationed in the Rhineland had sleeping sickness. Love letters between German women and their Senegalese boyfriends were published in French newspapers in attempt to show that the Senegalese were not the mindless brutes intent upon raping white women as claimed by the German government. The American historian Julia Roos wrote the debate about the \"Black Horror\" stories cut across ideological lines with for instance in France it was chiefly left-wing groups that felt the Treaty of Versailles was too harsh on Germany who were the most receptive towards promoting \"black horror\" stories while it was conservatives believed in the justice of Versailles who defended the Senegalese against the \"black horror\" claims.\n\nHowever, the French efforts were in vain. On the night of 28 February 1921, a protest rally attended by 12, 000 was held in Madison Square Garden in New York City where France was condemned for the \"black horror on the Rhine\". A Republican Representative, Frederick A. Britten, issued resolution condemning France for the \"black horror on the Rhine\", and which called the Senegalese \"semi-civilized, useless and oft-times brutal defamers of women\". The American feminist Harriet Connor Brown in a letter to the State Department written in early 1921 accused Senegalese soldiers of rape, attempted rape, \"immoral crimes against boys\" and of forcing German officials in the Rhineland to open brothels for their benefit. The Women's International League for Peace and Freedom issued a statement condemning the \"black horror on the Rhine\" that was signed by all 25 of its white members of its central committee, and the only one who refused to sign was the lone African-American on the central committee, Mary Terrell, who refused to sign a statement that was a \"direct appeal to race prejudice\".\n\nThe Francophile Republican Senator Henry Cabot Lodge had received leaked copies of the reports by Allen and Dresel, which he read out on the Senate floor \"as act of justice and comity to a friendly nation [France]\". Liberal American journals like \"The Nation\" and \"The New Republic\" ran several articles debunking the claims of \"the black horror on the Rhine\", showing that there were relatively few cases of rape by the Senegalese soldiers. \"The New York Times\" in an article on 25 June 1921 wrote about \"a horrid lack of horrors on the Rhine\". By 1921, many mayors in the Rhineland were complaining in letters to the \"Reich\" government in Berlin that the \"black horror\" propaganda had been too successful, charging that the picture of the Rhineland overrun by Senegalese soldiers looting, raping and killing with impunity, had destroyed the tourist trade. For this reason, the Rhenish mayors asked the \"Reich\" government stop the \"black horror\" propaganda which had ruined the tourism trade in the Rhineland.\n\nWhen Raymond Poincaré, a French conservative well known for his views about upholding the Treaty of Versailles, became the French premier in 1922, there was a much revival of the \"black horror on the Rhineland\" stories both in Germany and abroad. In Washington, Democratic Senator Gilbert Hitchcock in a speech on the Senate floor asked the administration of President Warren G. Harding \"suggest to France the substitution of white troops for black on the Rhine\". When the former French premier Georges Clemenceau visited the United States in November 1922, Senator Hitchcock confronted Clemenceau over the alleged \"black outrages\" in the Rhineland. In a speech, Senator Hitchcock declared about the Senegalese: \"They are men of an inferior, half-civilized race. They are brutes when stationed among white people, as the evidence shows\". Otto Wiefeldt, the German ambassador in Washington asked that his superiors supply him with \"current information preferably with sensational details\" as he noted that the stories about the \"black horror on the Rhine\" were winning over American public opinion to a pro-German position.\n\nHowever, the French occupation of the Ruhr on 11 January 1923 caused the \"Auswärtige Amt\" to lose interest in the \"black horror on the Rhine\" story. Poincaré deliberately used only white troops in occupying the Ruhr to avoid more \"black horror\" stories, through the claim that a Senegalese regiment had been stationed in Essen was widely believed in both Germany and abroad. For most Germans, the French occupation of the Ruhr was a sufficiently \"heinous crime against the peace\" that there was no need to embellish it with \"black horror\" stories. At the same time, the last American occupation troops had been withdrawn from the Rhineland in January 1923, which meant that American public opinion was less important in courting. In a speech given in Darmstadt on 13 February 1923, the Social Democratic German president Friedrich Ebert said: \"daß die Verwendung farbiger Truppen niederster Kultur als Aufseher über eine Bevölkerung von der hohen geistigen und wirtschaftlichen Bedeutung der Rheinländer eine herausfordernde Verletzung der Gesetze europäischer Zivilisation ist\" (\"the use of troops of the lowest culture over the population of the highest spiritual and economic importance in the Rhineland is a challenging violation of the laws of European civilization\").\n\nAfter 1921, the \"Reich\" government started to downplay the \"Black Horror\" propaganda, which had ruined tourism in the Rhineland, causing much resentment in a largely Catholic region that at very least wanted to break away from Protestant majority Prussia. Furthermore, many of those on the \"völkisch\" right made much of the fact there were consensual sexual relationships between mostly lower-class women in the Rhineland and \"colored\" French Army soldiers, attacking these women for bringing the so-called \"Rhineland Bastards\" into world and threatening German racial purity. In the viewpoint of the Rhinelanders the obsession with relationships between German women and non-white French soldiers was highlighting an aspect of the French occupation that was not to their best advantage, and many of the groups like the \"Rheinische Frauenliga\" that at first promoted the story chose to downplay it as the 1920s went on. Finally the \"Reich\" government saw its own \"Black Horror\" propaganda boomerang. Since Germany had been more or less disarmed by the Treaty of Versailles, it was not possible for the \"Reich\" to go to war with France, and the \"völkisch\" groups opposed to the Weimar Republic used the \"black horror\" stories as a way of attacking the Weimar Republic as an \"emasculated\" state incapable of standing up to France; such attacks especially resonated with right-wing men. The end of the Ruhr crisis in September 1923 together with the Dawes Plan in 1924 led to an improvement in Franco-German relations, and Berlin had less interest in pursuing \"black horror\" stories. In January 1925, the French pulled out of the northern Rhineland and by this time there were hardly any \"colored\" troops by the Rhine. Despite this, the Canadian feminist Rose Henderson in a 1925 article in \"The British Columbia Federationist\" wrote \"the power of France rests upon a black basis\", which she called \"one of the most menacing and sinister facts in history\", going to condemn the French for training the Senegalese \"to subdue and enslave white people\".\n\nHowever, the \"black horror on the Rhine\" did much to shape German views of both the French and Africans. In \"Mein Kampf\", Adolf Hitler wrote: \"7, 000, 000 people languish under alien rule and the main artery of the German people flows through the playground of black African hordes...It was and is the Jews who bring the Negro to the Rhineland, always with the same concealed thought and with the clear goal of destroying by the bastardization of the white race they hate\". In a 1928 speech, Hitler ranted against the \"de-Germanization, Negrification and Judaization of our people\". In his 1930 book \"The Myth of the 20th Century\", Alfred Rosenberg denounced France for \"contributing to the dehumanization of Europe by the means of blacks, just as had done by introducing Jewish emancipation 140 years ago\". The \"black horror on the Rhine\" story featured prominently in Nazi anti-French propaganda and throughout the Third Reich with a recurring image in posters showing French Army soldiers as \"a hideous African molesting blonde Aryan women\". On 29 May 1940 in part of the preparations for an offensive scheduled for 5 June, the Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels ordered a major media campaign to bring back memories of the \"Black Horror on the Rhine\" as a reason to hate France, saying at a conference that he wanted journalists to run stories that it had been \"a cultural and racial disgrace...to bring Negroes to the Rhineland\" and to remind German people that the French once again had \"colored\" soldiers fighting for the republic. During the offensive in June 1940 along the river Somme and during the pursuit into central France, the Wehrmacht massacred thousands of Senegalese taken prisoner to avenge the \"black horror on the Rhine\". In the spring of 1920, the conscience of the world had been stirred by mostly imaginary crimes said to have been committed by the Senegalese against the Germans. Twenty years later in the spring of 1940, nobody cared about the massacres of the Senegalese soldiers by the Germans with the French authorities making little effort after 1945 to prosecute the man responsible. Unlike the alleged \"black horror on the Rhine\" which received much media coverage, the massacres of Senegalese POWs in June 1940 received little attention either at the time or afterwards with most history books not even mentioning the massacres.\n\n\n"}

The center was established in 1966 and is housed in a former synagogue built in the Moorish Revival architectural style. The center is run as a public institution by the Sarajevo Canton. \n\nIn 1923 the Jewish Municipality of Sarajevo drew out plans to build a monumental synagogue in the city, at that time the capital of the Drinska banovina, which was home to one of the largest Jewish communities in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The preliminary plans outlined the municipality's desire for the synagogue to be the largest in Southeastern Europe. The motive behind the project was the fact that none of the city's existing synagogues could hold more then a fifth of the total Jewish congregation. A project board formed by the municipality and headed by notable Jewish industrialist, Avram Majer Altarac, purchased the land for 100,000 CHF, with construction beginning in 1926. The famous Croatian Art Nouveau architect Rudolf Lubinski was hired to design the building. His concept of a lavish Moorish Revivalist design, which was prevalent in the architecture of Sarajevo since Austro-Hungarian times was green lighted, with constuction being completed in 1930. The synagogue, known as the Il Kal Grande, was officially opened on 14 May 1931. \n\nAfter the Nazi invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941 and the establishment of the puppet Independent State of Croatia, severe racial laws were implemented by the occupying forced which lead to the desecration and looting of the synagogue in the first months of the occupation. After the end of the war the Jewish Municipality, whose community was desecrated during the holocaust with over 90 percent being murdered in concentration camps , donated the building to the city of Sarajevo. In 1965 architect Ivan Štraus was chosen to head renovation work on the building, which was reestablished as the Đuro Đaković Center, named after Yugoslav communist and revolutionary Đuro Đaković. The center contained a state of the art movie theatre, numerous workshops, classrooms and an art gallery.\n\nIn 1993, during the Siege of Sarajevo, the center was symbolically renamed the Bosnian Cultural Center. During subsequent years it has become the premier cultural center in Bosnia and Herzegovina, hosting weekly concerts, theatre productions and film screenings. It is one of the venues of the Sarajevo Film Festival, Sarajevo Jazz Festival and the main venue for Juventafest. It was expanded and renovated in 2015. Further renovations are planned for 2019. \n\n"}

Denunciation (\"call-outs\") can happen in person or online.\n\nSome commentators contend that callout culture is a pernicious influence in both the academic and business worlds, citing the controversy at Google over a memorandum concerning the respective vocational interests of men and women, authored by former Google engineer James Damore. Other commentators have argued that callout culture can harm progressive politics by attacking people perceived to have exhibited prejudiced behaviour, rather than using dialogue with such people to change such behaviour. A 2013 essay, \"Exiting the Vampire Castle\", by Mark Fisher, is often cited as an early critique of call-out culture. Fisher argued that \"call-out culture\" created a space where \"where solidarity is impossible, but guilt and fear are omnipresent\". Fisher also argues that call-out\nculture reduces every political issue to criticizing the behaviour of individuals, instead of dealing with such political issues through collective action. \n\nCall-out culture found a vehicle in social media. Both as consumers and as political activists, individuals found a means to communicate to a larger crowd in an expedient and pervasive manner. While call-out culture often publicly denounces perceived acts of bigotry, as stated above, it also refers to the act of publicly calling out a larger entity (such as an organization, business or vendor) usually by means of social media. In an effort to hold these businesses or organizations accountable, individuals will take to the online forums to \"call them out\". Whether the individual is addressed by a representative from within the organization or not, some of these posts or tweets (depending on the medium) can go viral and cause a PR headache for the business. \n\nThe effects of call-out culture are also noted as more prevalent today on college-campuses, where most students are aware of the social justice culture that exists and is expressed online. There are some that are careful to avoid missteps (ex: cultural appropriation by way of a Halloween costume) in order to avoid public online call-outs and others that are exploring ways to deal with past aggressors by way of call-out online.\n\nSome people argue in defense of call-out culture and contend that it is a form of social activism. The individual calling someone out is ultimately trying to either stop behavior they deem to be negative or prevent it from happening again. Others argue that the call-out culture today tends to be too aggressive and can often have life-altering affects on the individual being called out. \n\n\n"}

En route to perform at a Christmas special, his van — which doubles as his home — breaks down during a storm and he is stranded deep in the woods. Lost, cold, and succumbing to the elements, Marc is rescued by a local, an emaciated young man named Boris, who takes Marc to a run down inn.\n\nThe sole occupant of the inn is its proprietor, Mr. Bartel, an amiable old man who lives there as a hermit of sorts. Claiming to be a retired standup comedian, Bartel welcomes Marc to stay and offers to repair his van as a token of brotherhood between professional entertainers. Marc accepts the offer, but remains aloof, not speaking with Bartel about his own career or personal life.\n\nThe next morning, Mr. Bartel tows Marc's van into the front yard of the inn. Marc tells Bartel he is going for a walk, at which point Bartel suddenly becomes paranoid and aggressive, warning Marc not to go into the nearby village. Marc agrees, but during his walk he approaches a nearby farm, where he witnesses a family voyeuristically watching a teenage boy have intercourse with a pig, calling the experience \"so tender\". Meanwhile, rather than repairing Marc's van, Bartel snoops through Marc's living quarters and takes his mobile phone and some amateur pornographic photographs presented to Marc by a fan (Brigitte Lahaie).\n\nThat night, Bartel becomes even more aggressive, working himself into a frenzy while recalling his adulterous wife Gloria who abandoned him years before. He insists that Marc sing him a song before going to bed. The next day, Marc finds the homemade porn in the inn and realizes Bartel has been going through his things; when he attempts to call for help, he discovers that the telephone Bartel has been regularly using isn't even wired into the wall. Confronting Bartel, Marc discovers him vandalizing the van and pouring petrol over it; Bartel knocks Marc unconscious and blows the van up.\n\nMarc wakes to find himself tied to a chair, clad only in an old sundress. Mr. Bartel, now babbling, addresses Marc as if he were his wife, asking why \"she\" has come back after leaving him. Mr. Bartel sets about shaving one half of Marc's scalp, to \"protect\" him from the villagers, before forcing him into bed and cuddling next to him.\n\nThe next day, Bartel ties Marc to a tractor and takes him out into the woods to chop down a Christmas tree. Marc escapes, but ends up getting caught in a rabbit snare. He lies there prone while darkness falls, until Boris wanders by. Marc begs him for help, but Boris ignores his pleas, addressing Marc as if he were his lost dog. He sits beside Marc and pets and strokes him until the desperate Marc bites his leg, at which he goes away. The next morning, Bartel, alerted by Boris, retrieves Marc, driving him back to the inn covered by a blanket on the back of a hay truck. A pair of villagers see Boris driving the truck with something concealed under a blanket, but they take no action.\n\nBack at the inn, Bartel chastises \"Gloria\" for running away, then crucifies Marc behind the inn before going into the village to have a drink at the local pub. Seemingly convinced that his wife was a \"slut\" who was sleeping with every man in town, Bartel warns the men drinking in the bar that now \"she\" has \"returned\", none of them can \"have her\". The men all appear frightened at Bartel's ramblings, but once he leaves, one of the patrons sits at the antique piano and begins to play nightmarishly discordant polka music. Gradually the men all get up and begin dancing with one another.\n\nBack at the inn, Bartel brings Marc into the kitchen and they sit down for Christmas dinner. Boris arrives with a calf, convinced that it is his missing dog. Bartel gives a tearful, impassioned speech about love, togetherness, and the spirit of the holidays, before a sudden rifle shot rings out and a bullet explodes through the inn's window, killing Boris. The villagers lay siege to the inn, rushing the inn with a pig on a leash as one would employ a dog, intent on reclaiming the calf, and it quickly becomes apparent that they are also intent on raping Marc, in the shared delusion that Marc is Bartel's returned wife. The villagers mortally wound Bartel before turning their attention to Marc; one of them then briefly rapes Marc on the dining room table.\n\nShots are fired among the men and in the confusion Marc manages to escape from the mob and into the forest. He spends the night running from them through the woods, coming across a cemetery with an imposing crucified Christ gravestone, aligning with the Calvaire of the title. Marc manages to elude all but one of the men, who is about to capture \"Gloria\" when he falls into a bog and starts being swallowed up by the mire. Crying and broken, Marc approaches the drowning man. Instead of using the man's gun against him - or making any attempt to save him - Marc watches as he sinks below the surface. Finally, just before the man's head sinks into the marsh, Marc, as Gloria, responds to his impassioned question by telling him that \"she\" does, in fact, love him. Within seconds, the villager is dead, and Marc is left alone in the wilderness.\n\nIt premiered on 18 May 2004 as part of the Cannes Film Festival and had his US release on August 25, 2006. Its official English title was \"The Ordeal\", but most reviewers have still referred to it as \"Calvaire\" which refers to Christ's ordeal on his crucifixion.\n\nThe short film included on the Tartan Film DVD is called A wonderful love also directed by Fabrice Du Welz. Even the American DVD has Calvaire as the prominent title, with \"The Ordeal\" as a subtitle.\n\nThe film received mixed and divided reviews from critics.\nPeter Bradshaw from The Guardian awarded the film 4 out of a possible 5 stars, calling it \"A brilliant black comic nightmare\".\nMarc Savlov from Austin Chronicle awarded the film a negative 1 out of 5 stars, stating, \"Calvaire has a few passages of genuine dread – a barroom dance by the local villagers is just plain disturbing – but it takes so long to get going and fails to generate the necessary suspense to keep viewers engaged, that the horrific final act is too little, too late, while at the same time nearly being much too much\".\nJ.R. Jones from Chicago Reader gave the film a positive review, complimenting the film's thematic complexity and diabolical humor.\nIt currently has a rating of 39% \"Rotten\" on film review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 5.4/10 based on 23 reviews. On Metacritic the film has a more positive score of 52 based on 8 reviews.\n\n\n\n"}

August \"Auggie\" Anderson, a blind tech operative, is Annie's guide in her new life. In the beginning, Annie's cover story is that she works in Acquisitions at the Smithsonian Museum but she is later let go. As of the fourth season, her new cover is that of a glamorous and well-connected importer/exporter, with expensive tastes and dealings that may not always be legal. The series traces Annie's evolution from a wide-eyed young operative who fetches coffee for her co-workers to a hardened spy who doesn't balk at enhanced interrogation. This change in tone is also seen in the opening credits, which used chick lit-style graphics in the early seasons. The cartoons, like the focus on Annie's home life with her sister, were gone in the fourth and fifth seasons.\n\n\n\n\"Covert Affairs\" first appeared on USA Network's development slate in July 2008. The pilot episode was written by Matt Corman and Chris Ord. Casting was underway in June 2009, with the expectation that successful casting would lead to a production commitment. Piper Perabo was the first actress cast in early July 2009, as CIA officer Annie Walker. The casting of Christopher Gorham came in late July, quickly followed by an announcement that the pilot had been green-lighted by USA Network.\n\nIn early August 2009, Tim Matheson signed on to direct a 90-minute pilot. Further casting announcements included Anne Dudek in mid-August, followed by Kari Matchett and Peter Gallagher in early September. Eric Lively was cast as a fellow CIA officer and peer to Perabo's character, and Eion Bailey was cast in a recurring role as Annie Walker's ex-boyfriend. The pilot began filming in Toronto in September 2009.\n\nIn January 2010, the \"Covert Affairs\" pilot received a 10-episodes order. Sendhil Ramamurthy was added to the cast as a CIA officer, replacing Lively's character, along with Emmanuelle Vaugier in a recurring role as a journalist.\n\nThe series executive producers are Doug Liman and David Bartis and the co-executive producer is Jonathan Glassner. Production of the series takes place in Toronto, Ontario, at primary static sets housed in a studio, as well as at \"stock\" shooting locations throughout the local area. This is combined with material filmed at various international locations in which the series' episodes are set, such as Washington, D.C., capturing geographically unique elements of these places. In some instances, the series' producers use a stand-in location for shots where the costs and logistics of the actual location shoot are impractical, or if the location specified is fictional.\n\n\"Covert Affairs\" received positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports a 93% approval rating, while on Metacritic, the first season of \"Covert Affairs\" received a score of 64 out of 100, based on 23 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". The second season received a score of 68, based on six reviews. At the \"68th Golden Globe Awards\", Piper Perabo was nominated for Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series - Drama.

{"id": "863508", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=863508", "title": "Dalton Plan", "text": "Dalton Plan\n\nThe Dalton Plan is an educational concept created by Helen Parkhurst. It is inspired by the intellectual ferment at the turn of the 20th century. Educational thinkers such as Maria Montessori and John Dewey influenced Parkhurst while she created the Dalton Plan. Their aim was to achieve a balance between a child's talent and the needs of the community.\n\nThe American teacher Helen Parkhurst (1886-1973) developed at the beginning of the twentieth century the Dalton Plan to reform the then current pedagogics and the then usual manner of classroom management. She wanted to break the teacher-centered lockstep teaching. During her first experiment, which she implemented in a small elementary school as a young teacher in 1904, she noticed that when students are given freedom for self-direction and self-pacing and to help one another, their motivation increases considerably and they learn a lot more. In a later experiment in 1911 and 1912 Parkhurst re-organized the education in a large school for nine to fourteen year-olds. Instead of each grade, each subject was appointed its own teacher and its own classroom. The subject teachers made assignments: they converted the subject matter for each grade into learning assignments. In this way, learning became the students’ own work; they could carry out their work independently, work at their own pace and plan their work themselves. The classroom turned into a laboratory, a place where students are working, furnished and equipped as work spaces, tailored to meet the requirements of specific subjects. Useful and attractive learning materials, instruments and reference books were put within the students’ reach. The benches were replaced by large tables to facilitate co-operation and group instruction. This second experiment formed the basis for the next experiments, those in Dalton and New York, from 1919 onwards. The only addition was the use of graphs, charts enabling students to keep track of their own progress in each subject. From now on it was called the Dalton Plan.\n\nIn 1921 en 1922 Parkhurst explained the theory of the Dalton Plan in a series of articles published in “The Times Educational Supplement” and in her book “Education on the Dalton Plan”. It can be reconstructed as follows. The Dalton Plan is an “efficiency measure”: “a simple and economic reorganization of the school” (Parkhurst, 1922, 46). Lockstep teaching is not efficient, because: it is the teacher who does all the work. The Dalton Plan “creates conditions which enable ... the learner to learn” (34). Learning is the same as experience: “Experience is the best and indeed the only real teacher” (152). The school has to provide for sufficient experience. This cannot be achieved by keeping students as passive recipients, separating them from one another, holding them in one place, requiring them to remain silent, making them learn lessons by heart and subjecting them to whole class recitation. We can provide for experience through the “liberation of the pupil” and the “socialization of the school” (46). In the Dalton Plan, freedom is the opportunity to do the schoolwork oneself, to organize it oneself (how where and when) and to carry it out at one’s own pace, particularly to do it undisturbed and to work with commitment and concentration. Self-activity brings about experience. Something similar applies in the Dalton Plan to interaction and co-operation. When students are permitted to interact and work freely with one another and with teachers, in varying groups, in varied locations, with varied resources and materials, they come into contact with one another, the teachers, the subject matter and the learning materials in different ways. This means more experience and consequently more learning.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, Dalton education was spread throughout the world. There is no certainty regarding the exact numbers of Dalton schools, but there was Dalton education in America, Australia, England, Germany, the Netherlands, the Soviet Union, India, China and Japan. Particularly in the Netherlands, China and Japan, Dalton education has remained in existence. In recent years there has been a revival of international interest. It crops up again, for instance, in England, Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The Netherlands is the country with the highest density of Dalton schools. In 2013 there were five hundred; most of them elementary schools. Comprising five percent of all elementary schools, Dalton education is by far the largest educational reform movement in the Netherlands. And, contrary to Montessori, Jena Plan and Waldorf education, it is steadily on the increase. The only Dalton school in the USA, is the school that Helen Parkhurst founded herself in 1919, and which she was subsequently to direct for more than twenty years: the Dalton School in New York. It is a renowned school. But today its fame is not due to its origins as an experiment in progressive education: the Dalton School is one of the most expensive private schools in New York.\n\nParkhurst's specific objectives were as follows:\n\nShe developed a three-part plan that continues to be the structural foundation of a Dalton education:\n\nStudents move between subject \"laboratories\" (classrooms) and explore themes at their own pace.\n\nOn May 27, 1920, a very enthusiastic article describing the working of the Dalton Plan in detail was published in the \"Times' Educational Supplement\". Parkhurst \"has given to the secondary school the leisure and culture of the University student; she has uncongested the curriculum; she has abolished the teacher's nightly preparation of classes and the child's nightmare of homework. At the same time the children under her regime cover automatically all the ground prescribed for examinations 'of matriculation standard,' and examination failures among them are nil.\"\n\nThe Dalton Plan is a method of education by which pupils work at their own pace, and receive individual help from the teacher when necessary. There is no formal class instruction. Students draw up time-tables and are responsible for finishing the work on their syllabuses or assignments. Students are also encouraged to help each other with their work. The underlying aim of the Dalton Plan is to achieve the highest mental, moral, physical and spiritual development of the pupil.\n\nIn the spring of 1921, English headmistress Rosa Bassett went to the Children's University School and stayed with Parkhurst. They spent hours talking about education. Parkhurst found Bassett in complete agreement with her ideas: \"She was Dalton,\" Parkhurst wrote 50 years later. She described Bassett and Belle Rennie as the two people in England who were most enthusiastic and most helpful about the introduction of the Dalton Plan.\n\nIt was in 1922 that the UK Board of Education gave official approval and many hundreds of schools in England adopted some form of the Dalton Plan. That same year Parkhurst published \"Education on the Dalton Plan\". In time it was claimed that there were a thousand \"Dalton\" schools in Japan, another thousand in India, and many in the Soviet Union, Poland, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.\n\nToday there are a number of schools around the world and that employ variations of teaching methods based on the Dalton Plan. Most of the schools listed below interpret the Dalton Plan according to their needs. In some cases, they retain only a minimal part of the original Dalton Plan. Currently, the only schools that have strong affiliation with Helen Parkhurst's Dalton School in New York are Dalton Tokyo and Dalton Nagoya.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal School, Rahuri.

{"id": "1597736", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1597736", "title": "EN 13402", "text": "EN 13402\n\nEN 13402 Size designation of clothes is a European standard for labelling clothes sizes. It is based on body dimensions, measured in centimetres. It replaces many older national dress-size systems in popular use before the year 2007. Acceptance of this form of standardisation varies from country to country. For example, the Spanish Ministry of Health and Consumer Affairs has commissioned a study to categorise female body types with a view to harmonising Spanish clothing sizes with EN-13402. Few other countries are known to have followed suit. For children's clothing it is the de facto standard in most of Europe already.\n\nThere are three approaches for size-labelling of clothes:\n\n\nTraditionally, clothes have been labelled using many different ad hoc size systems.\nThis approach has led to a number of problems:\n\nTherefore, the European standards committee CEN/TC 248/WG 10 started in 1996 the process of designing a new modern system of labelling clothes sizes, resulting in the standard EN 13402 \"Size designation of clothes\".\n\nIt is based on:\n\nThe first part of the standard defines the list of body dimensions to be used for designating clothes sizes, together with an anatomical explanation and measurement guidelines. All body dimensions are measured, preferably without or as few as possible clothes, in centimetres, except for the body mass.\n\nThe standard also defines a pictogram that can be used in language-neutral labels to indicate one or several of the following body dimensions.\n\n\nThe second part of the standard defines for each type of garment one \"primary dimension\".\nThis is the body measure according to which the product must be labelled.\nWhere men’s garments use the chest girth, women’s clothes are designed for a certain bust girth.\n\nFor some types of garment, a single measure may not be sufficient to select the right product. In these cases, one or two \"secondary dimensions\" can be added to the label.\n\nThe following table shows the \"primary\" (in bold) and \"secondary dimensions\" listed in the standard, leaving out the redundant words \"girth\", \"length\" and \"size\" for better overview.\n\nThe third part of the standard defines preferred numbers of primary and secondary body dimensions.\n\nThe product should not be labelled with the average body dimension for which the garment was designed (i.e., not \"height: 176 cm.\"). Instead, the label should show the range of body dimensions from half the step size below to half the step size above the design size (e.g., \"height: 172–180 cm.\").\n\nFor heights, for example, the standard recommends generally to use the following design dimensions, with a step size of 8 cm:\n\nFor trousers, the recommended step size for height is 4 cm:\n\nThe standard defines similar tables for other dimensions and garments, only some of which are shown here.\n\nThe standard sizes and ranges for chest and waist girth are defined in steps of 4 cm:\nExample: While manufacturers will typically design clothes for \"chest girth\" = 100 cm such that it fits \"waist girth\" = 88 cm, they may also want to combine that \"chest girth\" with neighbouring \"waist girth\" step sizes 84 cm or 92 cm, to cover these drop types (−16 cm and −8 cm) as well.\n\nThe standard also suggests that neck girth can be associated with chest girth:\nThe standard further suggests that arm length can be associated with height:\nThe standard sizes and ranges for bust, waist and hip girth are mostly based on a step of 4 cm, for larger sizes 5 cm (hip) or 6 cm (bust and waist):\n\nThe European standard EN 13402 also defines bra sizes based on the \"bust girth\" and the \"underbust girth\". Bras are labeled with the under bust girth (rounded to the nearest multiple of 5 cm), followed by a letter code that indicates the \"cup size\" defined below, according to this table defined by the standard.\n\nThe standard sizes for brassiere are based on a step of 5 cm:\nThe secondary dimension \"cup size\" can be expressed in terms of the difference\nand can be labelled compactly using a letter code appended to the \"underbust girth\":\n\n\nFor clothes where a larger step size is sufficient, the standard also defines a letter code. This code represents the bust girth for women and the chest girth for men. The standard does not define such a code for children.\nEach range combines two adjacent size steps. The ranges could be extended below XXS or above 3XL if necessary.\n\nThe fourth part of the standard is still under review. It will define a compact coding system for clothes sizes. This was originally intended primarily for industry use in databases and as a part of stock-keeping identifiers and catalogue ordering numbers, but later users have also expressed a desire to use compact codes for customer communication. Writing out all the centimetre figures of all the primary and secondary measures from EN 13402-2 can – in some cases – require up to 12 digits. The full list of centimetre figures on the pictogram contains a lot of redundancy and the same information can be squeezed into fewer characters with lookup tables. EN 13402-4 will define such tables.\nAn earlier draft of this part of the standard attempted to list all in-use combinations of EN 13402-3 measures and assigned a short 2- or 3-digit code to each. Some of the industry representatives involved in the standardization process considered this approach too restrictive. Others argued that the primary dimension in centimetres should be a prominent part of the code. Therefore, this proposal, originally expected to be adopted in 2005, was rejected.\nSince then, several new proposals have been presented to the CEN working group. One of these, tabled by the European Association of National Organisations of Textile Traders (AEDT), proposes a 5-character alphanumeric code, consisting of the 3-digit centimetre figure of the primary body dimension, followed by one or two letters that code a secondary dimension, somewhat like the system already defined for bra sizes. For example, an item designed for 100 cm bust girth, 104 cm hip girth and 176 cm height could bear the compact size code \"100BG\". This proposal was agreed upon in 2006, but later disregarded. A paper by Bogusławska-Bączek published in 2010 showed that there were still significant difficulties in identifying clothing sizes.\n\n\n"}

In the 2016 Northern Ireland Assembly election, he was elected as an MLA for the Foyle constituency. He served for nearly 9 months before losing his seat in 2017.\n\nMcCann was born and has lived most of his life in Derry. Raised Catholic, he attended St. Columb's College and is prominently featured in the documentary film, \"The Boys of St. Columb's\". He later attended Queen's University Belfast, where he was president of the Literary and Scientific Society, the university's debating society.\n\nAs a young man he was one of the original organisers of the Derry Housing Action Committee (DHAC), a radical campaign group focusing on access to social housing. DHAC organised, in conjunction with the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA), the second civil rights march in Northern Ireland. This march, which took place on 5 October 1968, is generally seen as the birth date of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Movement. His political contemporaries included Bernadette Devlin, for whom he served as an election agent. He stood for election in the Foyle constituency at the 1969 Northern Ireland general election for the Northern Ireland Labour Party, placing third with 1,993 votes (12.3% of the total).\n\nHe was tried (as one of the so-called Raytheon 9) in Belfast in May–June 2008 over alleged damage caused during the 2006 War on Lebanon to a facility operated by multinational arms company Raytheon in Derry. The jury unanimously acquitted McCann, and all the other defendants, of charges of criminal damage to property belonging to Raytheon. The jury had heard that the groups's actions were prompted by repeated bombing of Lebanese property in which numerous civilians died and the wish to protect those lives and that property from being attacked by Israeli forces with weapons, weaponry systems and missiles supplied by Raytheon. The judge dismissed charges of affray after hearing the prosecution evidence. However, McCann was convicted of the theft of two computer discs, for which he received a 12-month conditional discharge.\n\nIn a statement outside the court McCann said: \"[We] have been vindicated. ... The jury have accepted that we were reasonable in our belief that ... Israeli ... Forces were guilty of war crimes in Lebanon in the summer of 2006. The action we took was intended to have, and did have, the effect of hampering or delaying the commission of war crimes\".\n\nHis appearance at the funeral of former PIRA volunteer, Old Bailey bomber, and republican activist Dolours Price, and a tribute he paid to her, was criticised by a son-in-law of Jean McConville, who was kidnapped, tortured and murdered by the PIRA. Price was suspected of being one of the paramilitaries who took part. McCann explained that her family had asked him to speak at her funeral. He said: \"I don't think I said anything at Dolours Price's grave that contradicted that [calling McConville's murder 'a horrible and unforgivable act'] ... The point I had in mind, the point I was making, was there are some people deeply implicated in the cruel murder of Mrs McConville who appear not to be undergoing any inner turmoil. They appear to find it very easy to handle the knowledge of their own involvement in that murder\".\n\nHe was elected as an MLA for Foyle in May 2016 but lost his seat in January 2017. While the number of seats in the Foyle constituency was reduced from six to five, McCann and People before Profit attracted criticism from Sinn Féin and pro-European activists for supporting Brexit in an area with the 4th highest remain vote (out of approximately 400 counting areas) in the whole of the United Kingdom. Nonetheless, McCann's vote increased in the 2017 election and he came close to taking the fifth seat from the DUP.\n\nMcCann was central to the setting up of the Bloody Sunday Justice Campaign; the role of his investigative journalism and decades of campaigning for justice for the Bloody Sunday families was recognised in 2010 when several of the families proposed him for the Paul Foot Award for campaigning journalism. Their citation said: \"EAMONN McCANN has been using his journalism to campaign for justice for the Bloody Sunday families for almost 40 years. The publication of the Saville Report in June marked a victory for the families, a victory of which McCann was very much a part.\n\nIn February 1972, within a month of the killings, McCann published the first pamphlet on Bloody Sunday, “What happened in Derry”. Throughout the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s he wrote about the injustice of Bloody Sunday whenever he got the opportunity. In the run-up to 1992, the 20th anniversary of the massacre, McCann made a proposal to the families for a book to mark the occasion. The publication of Bloody Sunday in Derry: What Really Happened was crucial in helping to bring together all the Bloody Sunday families for the first time into a single campaign.\n\nThroughout the 1990s McCann wrote constantly about Bloody Sunday, ensuring that every new piece of evidence about what had happened on the day and in the course of the subsequent cover-up was analysed and publicised. He wrote in the local Derry papers, in the Belfast Telegraph, the Irish Times, the Sunday Tribune, in the London Independent, the Guardian, the Observer – anywhere he could place a story. With the announcement of the Saville Tribunal, McCann's writing on Bloody Sunday came into its own. While other journalists focused only on the evidence of the more high-profile witnesses, McCann attended almost every day of the tribunal. He attended the hearings in London's Central Hall, paying his own costs to travel to and from London and staying with family while there. He wrote a weekly analysis for the Sunday Tribune in Dublin, and covered the proceedings daily for the Irish commercial radio station Today FM, as well as contributing articles to the Guardian, Observer, Irish Times, Irish Mirror and Irish Daily Mail.\"\n\nMcCann currently writes for the \"Belfast Telegraph\", \"The Irish Times\" and the \"Derry Journal\". He has written a column for the Dublin-based magazine, \"Hot Press\", and is a frequent commentator on the BBC, RTÉ and other broadcast media. He worked as a journalist for the \"Sunday World\" newspaper and contributed to the original \"In Dublin\" magazine, among others.\n\nMuch of his journalistic work reflects what he himself describes as a \"shuddering fascination\" with religion which, when coupled with his profound skepticism, has made it a topic to which he has often returned.\n\nIn March 2008, McCann spoke with National Public Radio in the U.S. about the solidarity between the Catholic civil rights movement in Northern Ireland and the Civil Rights Movement in the U.S.\n\nIn March 2014, following Crimea's referendum on joining Russia, McCann had a piece published in \"The Irish Times\" on the situation there. He commented: \"After six years in office, Obama believes he has a right to invade anywhere, bomb anything, kill anybody whose jib the CIA doesn't like the cut of, irrespective of national or international law or, indeed, of the provisions of the US constitution. And now he lectures Putin on the necessity of 'respecting international law'. He has a nerve.\" \n\nIn the same piece he wrote: \"Vladimir Putin may run a vicious regime but the people of Crimea have a right to be accepted as Russian if that's what they want, which evidently they do\", and added: \"Putin is right that the main motivation of the US and Nato has been to encircle and enfeeble his country. It might be a close run thing, but in this instance Russia has more right on its side than the West\".\n\n\nHe has also edited two books on Bloody Sunday:\n\nMcCann was the partner of Mary Holland (1935–2004), a journalist who worked for \"The Observer\" and \"The Irish Times\". He has a daughter from that relationship, Kitty, who is now a journalist for \"The Irish Times\", and a son, Luke, who works for the US-based human rights think tank The Center for Economic and Social Rights (www.cesr.org). The academic and activist Goretti Horgan has been his partner since the mid-1980s and they have an adult daughter, Matty.\n\nMcCann is a supporter of Derry City Football Club. In the 2002 film \"Bloody Sunday\", McCann was played by Irish actor Gerard Crossan.\n"}
{"id": "20270864", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20270864", "title": "Environmental enrichment", "text": "Environmental enrichment\n\nEnvironmental enrichment is the stimulation of the brain by its physical and social surroundings. Brains in richer, more stimulating environments have higher rates of synaptogenesis and more complex dendrite arbors, leading to increased brain activity. This effect takes place primarily during neurodevelopment, but also during adulthood to a lesser degree. With extra synapses there is also increased synapse activity, leading to an increased size and number of glial energy-support cells. Environmental enrichment also enhances capillary vasculation, providing the neurons and glial cells with extra energy. The neuropil (neurons, glial cells, capillaries, combined together) expands, thickening the cortex. Research on rodent brains suggests that environmental enrichment may also lead to an increased rate of neurogenesis.\n\nResearch on animals finds that environmental enrichment could aid the treatment and recovery of numerous brain-related dysfunctions, including Alzheimer's disease and those connected to aging, whereas a lack of stimulation might impair cognitive development. Moreover, this research also suggests that environmental enrichment leads to a greater level of cognitive reserve, the brain's resilience to the effects of conditions such as aging and dementia.\n\nResearch on humans suggests that lack of stimulation delays and impairs cognitive development. Research also finds that attaining and engaging in higher levels of education, environments in which people participate in more challenging cognitively stimulating activities, results in greater cognitive reserve.\n\nDonald O. Hebb in 1947 found that rats raised as pets performed better on problem solving tests than rats raised in cages. His research, however, did not investigate the brain nor use standardized impoverished and enriched environments. Research doing this first was started in 1960 at the University of California, Berkeley by Mark Rosenzweig, who compared single rats in normal cages, and those placed in ones with toys, ladders, tunnels, running wheels in groups. This found that growing up in enriched environments affected enzyme cholinesterase activity. This work led in 1962 to the discovery that environmental enrichment increased cerebral cortex volume. In 1964, it was found that this was due to increased cerebral cortex thickness and greater synapse and glial numbers.\n\nAlso starting around 1960, Harry Harlow studied the effects of maternal and social deprivation on rhesus monkey infants (a form of environmental stimulus deprivation). This established the importance of social stimulation for normal cognitive and emotional development.\n\nRats raised with environmental enrichment have thicker cerebral cortices (3.3–7%) that contain 25% more synapses. This effect of environmental richness upon the brain occurs whether it is experienced immediately following birth, after weaning, or during maturity. When synapse numbers increase in adults, they can remain high in number even when the adults are returned to impoverished environment for 30 days suggesting that such increases in synapse numbers are not necessarily temporary. However, the increase in synapse numbers has been observed generally to reduce with maturation. Stimulation affects not only synapses upon pyramidal neurons (the main projecting neurons in the cerebral cortex) but also stellate ones (that are usually interneurons). It also can affect neurons outside the brain in the retina.\n\nEnvironmental enrichment affects the complexity and length of the dendrite arbors (upon which synapses form). Higher-order dendrite branch complexity is increased in enriched environments, as can the length, in young animals, of distal branches.\n\nSynapses in animals in enriched environments show evidence of increased synapse activation. Synapses tend to also be much larger. Gamma oscillations become larger in amplitude in the hippocampus. This increased energy consumption is reflected in glial and local capillary vasculation that provides synapses with extra energy.\nThese energy related changes to the neuropil are responsible for increasing the volume of the cerebral cortex (the increase in synapse numbers contributes in itself hardly any extra volume).\n\nPart of the effect of environmental enrichment is providing opportunities to acquire motor skills. Research upon “acrobatic” skill learning in the rat shows that it leads to increased synapse numbers.\n\nEnvironmental enrichment during pregnancy has effects upon the fetus such as accelerating its retinal development.\n\nEnvironmental enrichment can also lead to the formation of neurons (at least in rats) and reverses the loss of neurons in the hippocampus and memory impairment following chronic stress. However, its relevance has been questioned for the behavioral effects of enriched environments.\n\nEnriched environments affect the expression of genes in the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus that determine neuronal structure. At the molecular level, this occurs through increased concentrations of the neurotrophins NGF, NT-3, and changes in BDNF. This alters the activation of cholinergic neurons, 5-HT, and beta-adrenolin. Another effect is to increase proteins such as synaptophysin and PSD-95 in synapses. Changes in Wnt signaling have also been found to mimic in adult mice the effects of environmental enrichment upon synapses in the hippocampus. Increase in neurons numbers could be linked to changes in VEGF.\n\nResearch in animals suggests that environmental enrichment aids in recovery from an array of neurological disorders and cognitive impairments. There are two mains areas of focus: neurological rehabilitation and cognitive reserve, the brain's resistance to the effects of exposure to physical, natural, and social threats. Although most of these experiments used animal subjects, mainly rodents, researchers have pointed to the affected areas of animal brains to which human brains are most similar and used their findings as evidence to show that humans would have comparable reactions to enriched environments. The tests done on animals are thus meant to represent human simulations for the following list of conditions.\n\nA study conducted in 2011 led to the conclusion that environmental enrichment vastly improves the cognitive ability of children with autism. The study found that autistic children who receive olfactory and tactile stimulation along with exercises that stimulated other paried sensory modalities clinically improved by 42 percent while autistic children not receiving this treatment clinically improved by just 7 percent. The same study also showed that there was significant clinical improvement in autistic children exposed to enriched sensorimotor environments, and a vast majority of parents reported that their child's quality of life was much better with the treatment. A second study confirmed its effectiveness. The second study also found after 6 months of sensory enrichment therapy, 21% of the children who initially had been given an autism classification, using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, improved to the point that, although they remained on the autism spectrum, they no longer met the criteria for classic autism. None of the standard care controls reached an equivalent level of improvement. The therapy using the methodologies is titled Sensory Enrichment Therapy.\n\nThrough environmental enrichment, researchers were able to enhance and partially repair memory deficits in mice between ages of 2 to 7 months with characteristics of Alzheimer's disease. Mice in enriched environments performed significantly better on object recognition tests and the Morris Water Maze than they had when they were in standard environments. It was thus concluded that environmental enrichment enhances visual and learning memory for those with Alzheimer's. Furthermore, it has been found that mouse models of Alzheimer's disease that were exposed to enriched environment before amyloid onset (at 3 months of age) and then returned to their home cage for over 7 months, showed preserved spatial memory and reduced amyloid deposition at 13 months old, when they are supposed to show dramatic memory deficits and amyloid plaque load. These findings reveal the preventive, and long-lasting effects of early life stimulating experience on Alzheimer-like pathology in mice and likely reflect the capacity of enriched environment to efficiently stimulate the cognitive reserve.\n\nResearch has indicated that environmental enrichment can help relieve motor and psychiatric deficits caused by Huntington's disease. It also improves lost protein levels for those with the disease, and prevents striatal and hippocampal deficits in the BDNF, located in the hippocampus. These findings have led researchers to suggest that environmental enrichment has a potential to be a possible form of therapy for those with Huntington's.\n\nMultiple studies have reported that environmental enrichment for adult mice helps relieve neuronal death, which is particularly beneficial to those with Parkinson's disease. A more recent study shows that environmental enrichment particularly affects the nigrostriatal pathway, which is important for managing dopamine and acetylcholine levels, critical for motor deficits. Moreover, it was found that environmental enrichment has beneficial effects for the social implications of Parkinson's disease.\n\nResearch done in animals has shown that subjects recovering in an enriched environment 15 days after having a stroke had significantly improved neurobehavioral function. In addition these same subjects showed greater capability of learning and larger infarct post-intervention than those who were not in an enriched environment. It was thus concluded that environmental enrichment had a considerable beneficial effect on the learning and sensorimotor functions on animals post-stroke. A 2013 study also found that environmental enrichment socially benefits patients recovering from stroke. Researchers in that study concluded that stroke patients in enriched environments in assisted-care facilities are much more likely to be engaging with other patients during normal social hours instead of being alone or sleeping.\n\nA 2008 study found that environmental enrichment was significant in aiding recovery of motor coordination and some recovery of BDNF levels in female mice with conditions similar to those of Rett syndrome. Over the course of 30 weeks female mice in enriched environments showed superior ability in motor coordination to those in standard conditions. Although they were unable to have full motor capability, they were able to prevent a more severe motor deficit by living in an enriched environment. These results combined with increased levels of BDNF in the cerebellum led researchers to conclude that an enriched environment that stimulates areas of the motor cortex and areas of the cerebellum having to do with motor learning is beneficial in aiding mice with Rett syndrome.\n\nA recent study found that adult rats with amblyopia improved visual acuity two weeks after being placed into an enriched environment. The same study showed that another two weeks after ending environmental enrichment, the rats retained their visual acuity improvement. Conversely, rats in a standard environment showed no improvement in visual acuity. It was thus concluded that environmental enrichment reduces GABA inhibition and increases BDNF expression in the visual cortex. As a result, the growth and development of neurons and synapses in the visual cortex were much improved due to the enriched environment.\n\nStudies have shown that with the help of environmental enrichment the effects of sensory deprivation can be corrected. For example, a visual impairment known as \"dark-rearing\" in the visual cortex can be prevented and rehabilitated. In general, an enriched environment will improve, if not repair, the sensory systems animals possess.\n\nDuring development, gestation is one of the most critical periods for exposure to any lead. Exposure to high levels of lead at this time can lead to inferior spatial learning performance. Studies have shown that environmental enrichment can overturn damage to the hippocampus induced by lead exposure. Learning and spatial memory that are dependent on the long-term potentiation of the hippocampus are vastly improve as subjects in an enriched environments had lower levels of lead concentration in their hippocampi. The findings also showed that enriched environments result in some natural protection of lead-induced brain deficits.\n\nResearch has indicated that animals suffering from spinal cord injuries showed significant improvement in motor capabilities even with a long delay in treatment after the injury when exposed to environmental enrichment. Social interactions, exercise, and novelty all play major roles in aiding the recovery of an injured subject. This has led to some suggestions that the spinal cord has a continued plasticity and all efforts must be made for enriched environments to stimulate this plasticity in order to aid recovery.\n\nMaternal deprivation can be caused by the abandonment by a nurturing parent at a young age. In rodents or nonhuman primates, this leads to a higher vulnerability for\nstress-related illness. Research suggests that environmental enrichment can reverse the effects of maternal separation on stress reactivity, possibly by affecting the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex.\n\nIn all children, maternal care is one of the significant influences for hippocampal development, providing the foundation for stable and individualized learning and memory. However, this is not the case for those who have experienced child neglect. Researchers determined that through environmental enrichment, a neglected child can partially receive the same hippocampal development and stability, albeit not at the same level as that of the presence of a parent or guardian. The results were comparable to those of child intervention programs, rendering environmental enrichment a useful method for dealing with child neglect.\n\nDecreased hippocampal neurogenesis is a characteristic of aging. Environmental enrichment increases neurogenesis in aged rodents by potentiating neuronal differentiation and new cell survival. As a result, subjects exposed to environmental enrichment aged better due to superior ability in retaining their levels of spatial and learning memory.\n\nResearch has shown that mice exposed to environmental enrichment are less affected by the consequences of cocaine exposure in comparison with those in standard environments. Although the levels of dopamine in the brains of both sets of mice were relatively similar, when both subjects were exposed to the cocaine injection, mice in enriched environment were significantly less responsive than those in standard environments. It was thus concluded that both the activating and rewarding effects are suppressed by environmental enrichment and early exposure to environmental enrichment can help prevent drug addiction.\n\nThough environmental enrichment research has been mostly done upon rodents, similar effects occur in primates, and are likely to affect the human brain. However, direct research upon human synapses and their numbers is limited since this requires histological study of the brain. A link, however, has been found between educational level and greater dendritic branch complexity following autopsy removal of the brain.\n\nMRI detects localized cerebral cortex expansion after people learn complex tasks such as mirror reading (in this case in the right occipital cortex), three-ball juggling (bilateral mid-temporal area and left posterior intraparietal sulcus), and when medical students intensively revise for exams (bilaterally in the posterior and lateral parietal cortex). Such changes in gray matter volume can be expected to link to changes in synapse numbers due to the increased numbers of glial cells and the expanded capillary vascularization needed to support their increased energy consumption.\n\nChildren that receive impoverished stimulation due to being confined to cots without social interaction or reliable caretakers in low quality orphanages show severe delays in cognitive and social development. 12% of them if adopted after 6 months of age show autistic or mildly autistic traits later at four years of age. Some children in such impoverished orphanages at two and half years of age still fail to produce intelligible words, though a year of foster care enabled such children to catch up in their language in most respects. Catch-up in other cognitive functioning also occurs after adoption, though problems continue in many children if this happens after the age of 6 months\n\nSuch children show marked differences in their brains, consistent with research upon experiment animals, compared to children from normally stimulating environments. They have reduced brain activity in the orbital prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, temporal cortex, and brain stem. They also showed less developed white matter connections between different areas in their cerebral cortices, particularly the uncinate fasciculus.\n\nConversely, enriching the experience of preterm infants with massage quickens the maturating of their electroencephalographic activity and their visual acuity. Moreover, as with enrichment in experimental animals, this associates with an increase in IGF-1.\n\nAnother source of evidence for the effect of environment stimulation upon the human brain is cognitive reserve (a measure of the brain’s resilience to cognitive impairment) and the level of a person’s education. Not only is higher education linked to a more cognitively demanding educational experience, but it also correlates with a person’s general engagement in cognitively demanding activities. The more education a person has received, the less the effects of aging, dementia, white matter hyperintensities, MRI-defined brain infarcts, Alzheimer's disease, and traumatic brain injury. Also, aging and dementia are less in those that engage in complex cognitive tasks. The cognitive decline of those with epilepsy could also be affected by the level of a person’s education.\n\n\n"}

However, the term also refers to the product of this type of research, which of course normally takes a textual form. As a result, ethnography is also sometimes seen as a \"genre of writing, one\" used to describe patterns of human social interaction in particular contexts.\n\nWithin the context of ethnography, the term 'realism' is often used to refer to the assumptions that some kinds of ethnographic work make about the phenomena to be investigated, and how these are to be understood. However, 'ethnographic realism' has also been used to refer to a style of writing that narrates the author's experiences and observations as if the reader were witnessing or experiencing events first hand. A work written using ethnographic realism may be referred to as a realist ethnography, and classified as a subgenre of ethnography.\n\nGeorge Marcus and Dick Cushman described and categorized realist ethnographies under certain characteristics.\n"}

It was written and directed by Kenji Kamiyama, with original character design by Hajime Shimomura and a soundtrack by Yoko Kanno. The first season aired from October 2002 to October 2003 and was positively received by critics. A second season titled Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG, known in Japan as , aired from January 2004 to January 2005.\n\nThe series centers on the members of an elite law enforcement unit known as Public Security Section 9 as they investigate cybercrime and terrorism cases; these cases often are connected to their pursuit of an elite \"Super Class A\" hacker and corporate terrorist known as \"The Laughing Man\". A series of associated short comic animations, titled \"Tachikomatic Days\", aired after each episode. These shorts star the Tachikoma \"think-tanks\" from the main series, and they typically relate directly to the story of the preceding \"Stand Alone Complex\" episode.\n\nThe first season was adapted into a feature-length OVA titled \"The Laughing Man\", which was released in 2005. The series had also received video game spin-offs for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, and mobile phones. \"2nd GIG\" was also later adapted into a feature-length OVA entitled \"Individual Eleven\", which was released in 2006. \"\", a TV-film sequel to the \"Stand Alone Complex\" series, was also released in that year.\n\nThe series takes place in the year 2030, where many people have become cyborgs with prosthetic bodies. Primarily set in the fictional Japanese city of , the series follows the members of Public Security Section 9, a special-operations task-force made up of former military officers and police detectives. While the group investigates various crimes, both seasons feature ongoing investigations into two incidents that embroil the group in corruption within other branches of the Japanese government.\n\nThe first season of \"Stand Alone Complex\" focuses on the Laughing Man incident, wherein a hacktivist ultimately reveals to the Major that he had discovered that several micromachine manufacturing corporations, in association with the Japanese government, suppressed information on an inexpensive cure to a debilitating cyberization disease in order to profit from the more expensive micromachine treatment. He abducted one of the owners of the company and attempted to force him to reveal the truth on live television, resulting in the hacker live-hacking everyone's vision and cameras at the event to cover his face with the stylized laughing face logo that became synonymous with his image. His popularity spawned several genuine imitators, resulting in the series' titular Stand Alone Complex. When Section 9 discovers that these companies and several Japanese politicians later used the Laughing Man's image to garner public support and profit, they begin a campaign to disseminate the truth, ultimately leading to the Cabinet labeling them as domestic terrorists and forcibly disbanding them, resulting in the capture of several members and the apparent death of Motoko Kusanagi. However, it is all a ruse to deceive the government, and the very alive and well members of Section 9 regroup to bring the micromachine corporations and corrupt politicians to justice, resulting in the dissolution of the current Japanese government.\n\nThe second season, \"2nd GIG\", set two years after the events of the first season, explores the political and social ramifications of the two world wars that took place prior to the events of the series. At the time of the Third and the Fourth World Wars, about three million Asians became refugees and were invited into Japan as a source of cheap labor. These \"invited refugees\", based on the reclaimed island of Dejima, soon became unemployed in the post-war period, and their social unrest borders on outright war. Section 9's involvement in the refugee issue begins after they successfully stop a hostage crisis caused by a terrorist group known as the Individual Eleven, after which newly elected Prime Minister Yoko Kayabuki officially reinstates the organization. The group seems to be modeling themselves after the May 15 Incident, where a group of naval officers assassinated the Prime Minister and then gained the support of the public, and hope to stir up the refugees' spirits by fighting for them against the Japanese government. The group also comes into contact with Kazundo Goda, head of the Cabinet Intelligence Service, who gets assistance from the group in defusing several instances between the refugees as well as assisting him in transporting plutonium through Dejima, result in several failures and refugee deaths, further straining relations. Section 9 ultimately discovers that Goda has been manipulating both events behind the scenes, leaking the social virus that creates the Individual Eleven ideology and creating a new Stand Alone Complex, as well as the intentional failures with the refugees. However, he cannot account for the charismatic Hideo Kuze who genuinely believes in the best for the refugees and helps rally for their independence from Japan. Throughout the investigation, Kusanagi discovers she may know Kuze from her childhood. Ultimately, Goda is found guilty of his part in the refugee incidents and killed before he can defect to the American Empire, but not before his ministrations also result in the death of Kuze.\n\nIn the film \"\", taking place two years following the resolution of the Individual Eleven incident, the Major has left Section 9, and Togusa is now field commander, leading an investigation into several deaths of refugees from the Siak Republic, which results in the discovery of a government computer system coordinating the kidnappings of 20 thousand abused children who have had their cyberbrains replaced and placing them under the care of several senior citizens made comatose by another government program that takes care of all of their bodily needs. Their investigation, which brings the Major out of hiding, reveals an entity known as the Puppeteer behind the kidnappings, but the Puppeteer is a rhizome formed by the collective will of the senior citizens, and it was only the Siak Republic's intent to use the kidnapped children in their plans that led to their downfall. However, the investigation further reveals that a member of the House of Representatives is also using the children for his nationalistic purposes, and Section 9 with the Major infiltrates a welfare center where the MP brainwashes the children, resulting in the Puppeteer revealing his own identity that the senior citizens wished to give the children free will in their future, with the politician interfering in that new plan.\n\n\"Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex\" was animated by Production I.G, and produced by Bandai Visual, Bandai Entertainment, Dentsu, Nippon Television Network, Tokuma Shoten, Victor Entertainment, Anchor Bay Entertainment, and Manga Entertainment. The series was directed and written by Kenji Kamiyama, with additional screenwriters including Junichi Fujisaku, Yoshiki Sakurai, Shōtarō Suga, Dai Satō, Nobutoshi Terado, Yutaka Ōmatsu, and Yūichirō Matsuka. Masamune Shirow, author of the original \"Ghost in the Shell\" manga, provided plot for several episodes, sketches of characters and mechanical designs (including the Tachikoma), and gave his approval to the scripts before production. The series was produced with an 800 million yen investment. Kenji Kamiyama decided to make the anime television series as a \"relative\" to the manga and film, serving as a separate parallel world from both.\n\nFor the second season, Mamoru Oshii had contributed with his ideas to the concept of the entire series and initial planning stages. Shuko Murase stated that they were initially going to concentrate on how Japan was going to participate in war after 9/11 as intended to portray a fictional future. But by the time they were working on the episodes, the Iraq War had already started and Japan's Self-Defense Force was sent to Iraq. During this time Japan also had an election. Murase continued to state that he created the \"Individual Eleven\" episodes to express irresponsibility of the Japanese people when they voted for the politicians that planned to send Japanese troops to Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nThe soundtrack for the series was composed by Yoko Kanno and produced by Victor Entertainment. The first season's opening theme is \"Inner Universe\" performed by Origa (written by Origa and Shanti Snyder). The lyrics are in Russian, English, and Latin. The first season's ending theme is \"Lithium Flower\" performed by Scott Matthew (written by Tim Jensen). When the series was later re-broadcast on terrestrial television in Japan, \"Inner Universe\" was replaced with \"GET9\", performed by jillmax (written by Tim Jensen), while \"Lithium Flower\" was replaced with \"I Do\", written and performed by Ilaria Graziano.\n\nThe opening theme for \"S.A.C. 2nd GIG\" is \"Rise\" performed by Origa (written by Tim Jensen), while the ending theme is \"Living Inside the Shell\" performed by Steve Conte (written by Shanti Snyder). \"2nd GIG\" also used alternate opening and closing themes when it was re-broadcast on terrestrial television, with \"Rise\" was replaced by \"CHRisTmas in the SiLenT ForeSt\" performed by Ilaria Graziano (written by Shanti Snyder), and \"Living Inside the Shell\" was replaced by \"Snyper\", performed by Ilaria Graziano (written by Tim Jensen).\n\nThe anime television network Animax first licensed and broadcast the series in 2002 across most of Asia, as well as in Latin America. It was subsequently licensed by both Anchor Bay Entertainment and Manga Entertainment in North America, and Madman Entertainment in Australia. It was broadcast in the United States on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim programming block, in Canada by YTV and in the United Kingdom by AnimeCentral. A series of associated short comic animations, titled , aired immediately after each episode of the series. These shorts star the Tachikoma \"think-tanks\" from the main series, and typically relate directly to the story of the preceding \"Stand Alone Complex\" episode.\n\nThe second season of \"Stand Alone Complex\", titled \"Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG\", aired on Animax from 1 January 2004 to 8 January 2005. The production of a second season was immediately decided after the first season's TV airing. The second season was initially hinted when Bandai has extended the episode list to 52 episodes at Otakon of 2003. On Halloween of 2003, Production I.G officially announced a second season for \"Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex\".\n\nIt premiered on 1 January 2004 in Japan on SKY PerfecTV!'s Perfect Choice (Animax), on a pay-per-view basis. The series was later aired on the terrestrial Nippon TV from 6 April 2005. Animax also later aired the series across its other networks worldwide, including its English language networks in Southeast Asia and South Asia, as well as its other networks in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Latin America, and several other regions. \"2nd GIG\" was also later aired in the United States on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim block. Bandai Visual owns the DVD distribution rights in Japan, while Anchor Bay Entertainment and Manga Entertainment owns the distribution rights in North America and Europe. The show began airing daily on AnimeCentral beginning 4 November 2007 in both English (two nightly screenings) and original Japanese (one late-night screening).\n\nOn 18 March 2015 it was announced that \"Stand Alone Complex\" would receive a full weekly rebroadcasting in Japan on BS11, starting on 1 April 2015 onward.

The OVA retells the first season of the anime television series with minor alterations to the storyline to accommodate an abbreviated take on the Laughing Man affair. Some additional animation and voice work was also added. Although the Japanese-language version retained the voice cast from the anime series, the English version has a new cast of voice actors. The dialogue recording for the English version was produced by Ocean Productions. A Blu-ray version was released on 22 December 2010.\n\n\"Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG – Individual Eleven\" is a feature-length OVA which retells the events of \"S.A.C. 2nd GIG\", altered to focus on both the Individual Eleven investigation and the relationship between Hideo Kuze and Motoko Kusanagi. Newly animated scenes and a remixed soundtrack are also included.\n\nA TV-film sequel titled \"\" was released in 2006.\n\n\"Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex\" has received three video game spin offs. The first video game is \"\" for the PlayStation 2 and was developed by Cavia. It was released on 4 March 2004 in Japan and 8 November 2004 in North America.

The third is an online first person shooter for the PC, titled Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - First Assault Online. Although it is still in beta at the time of this writing it is an open beta and it already has many players.\n\nSeveral mobile phone games have been released exclusively to Japan. The first is titled and was developed by GREE and released on 14 February 2011. The second shares the name of the anime and PlayStation 2 video game, was developed by Mobage and released on 16 November 2011. The game focuses on an unnamed new detective who works for Section 9. The third is a social game also developed by Mobage, titled , and released on 29 March 2012.\n\nOn 13 December 2012, Nexon stated it had obtained the rights of \"Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex\" for the purpose of the creation of a massively multiplayer online game.

The first was called Shadow.Net written by Toh Enjoe which references the Puppeteer's actions from the Solid State Society film but could also conceivably be referring to the events in the manga. The second story(which appears as the third story in the collection) was called Soft and White by Kafka Asagiri which revolves around the Laughing Man's actions in the time period between Standalone Complex and 2nd GIG.\n\nTwo manga series based on \"Stand Alone Complex\" have been published by Kodansha.

Other merchandise includes clothing, key chains, notebooks, patches, bags, posters and body pillows.\n\n\"Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex\" received mostly positive from reviewers, who praised the series' high quality of animation and the musical score by Yoko Kanno. In particular, reviewers reacted positively to the world of high-technology that \"Stand Alone Complex\" presents, described as \"believably futuristic\". Lawrence Person from \"Locus Online\" wrote that \"the world of [Stand Alone Complex] is recognizably our own, or rather, one recognizably extrapolated from modern Japan. While parts of the technology seem unlikely in the time-frame allotted, none seems impossible.\" In addition, several reviews mentioned what they perceived to be overarching themes explored in the series as a result of the setting; specifically, the meaning of humanity in a world where the lines between man and machine were becoming increasingly blurred, as well as various societal issues that might emerge as a result of advances in technology.\n\nReviewers agreed that the main \"Laughing Man\" storyline was satisfying, characterizing it variously as \"interesting\", \"complex\", and \"engaging\". Reaction to the series' \"Stand Alone\" episodes, however, was mixed: some reviewers considered these episodes to be boring and, in some cases, the worst episodes of the series, while others contended that they allowed further development of the characters and the futuristic setting.\n\nCertain commentators specifically focused on the series' success or failure in achieving the high standards set by the critically acclaimed 1995 film \"Ghost in the Shell\". Opinion in this regard was divided: although these reviewers took an overall favorable view, some reviews criticized the quality of animation, while others felt that the series' story lacked the depth of the original film. This \"lack of depth\", however, was attributed to the fact that \"Stand Alone Complex\" is an action-oriented series with a limited episode length in which to explore deeper themes.\n\nBolstering the generally positive reviews of the series, \"Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex\" won an Excellence Prize (Animation Division) at the 2002 Japan Media Arts Festival, a Notable Entry Award at the 2003 Tokyo International Anime Fair, and was featured in June 2004 by Newtype USA, with a \"double scoop\" cover story. The Japan Media Arts Festival provided a brief summary of \"Stand Alone Complex\", calling it a \"completely original television series...entertaining and easy to understand\".\n\nChris Beveridge of Mania gave \"2nd GIG\" an overall score of A praising its coloring stating, \"Colors are gorgeous and solid, especially all the various areas of large soft colors that look to be amazingly solid and with no visible break-up even during pausing.\" Mark Thomas of \"Mania\" also gave it an overall score of A, stating: \"It has plenty of good action and thought provoking plot points.\" Andy Patricio of IGN rated the first DVD volume 9/10 praised the animation, stating: \"Artwork is richer; this is easily the best-looking anime Production I.G. has ever produced. CG is richer and more widely-used. Animation is more complex and fluid, although it's still a little jerky, which is common in TV shows.\" Joe Luscik of Animefringe ranked the series 4.5 out of 5 praising the animation stating it \"is just awesome\". Adam Arseneau of DVD Verdict praised the direction of the 2nd season compared to the first stating, \"The tongue-in-cheek humor that made the show clever and endearing is still present, but the atmosphere feels more violent, more urban and dystopic, as if no longer afraid to address the social problems of the future.\"\n\n\n"}

The book relies almost entirely on interviews and anecdotes from the cable channel’s founders and the artists whose videos appeared on the channel. Over 400 artists, directors, and staff of MTV were interviewed by the authors, music journalists Craig Marks and Rob Tannenbaum. The book's name is derived from a marketing campaign launched by the channel in 1981 that featured many of the artists appearing on the channel at the time exclaiming “I Want My MTV!” The primary purpose of the campaign was to encourage cable subscribers to request the channel on their cable TV lineup. The book is published by Dutton Penguin in the United States.\n\nCraig Marks has been the editor of three influential publications: \"Spin\", \"Blender\", and \"Billboard\". In addition, he has written for \"Rolling Stone\", \"GQ\", and the \"New York Times\". He is the co-founder of the pop music site \"Popdust\".\n\nRob Tannenbaum has written for \"GQ\", \"New York\", the \"New York Times Magazine\", \"Details\", \"Rolling Stone\", \"Spin\", the \"Village Voice\", the \"New York Observer\", \"Harper’s Bazaar\", \"George\", \"Premiere\", and \"Playboy\". He was the music editor of \"Blender\".\n\n\"Remember when MTV was just about music videos?\" \"I Want My MTV\" chronicles the rise of MTV from its early inception at the beginning of cable television's advance into the suburbs and beyond. As an oral history, the authors interview over 400 artists, music industry, video disc-jockeys or VJs. The book follows the evolution of MTV from the first new wave videos imported from Britain, to the introduction of black artists, including Michael Jackson, and the rise of hair metal bands. The book concludes its history in 1992 when MTV first revealed the groundbreaking reality show \"The Real World\", grunge music made its debut, and MTV broke away from its all-video format.\n\nThe book covers the hiring of the first VJ's based on Bob Pittman's analysis that the video channel needed human beings. The first five VJs were selected to match certain demographics.\n\nThe launch of MTV occurred on August 1, 1981 with the classic MTV promo of the Apollo 11 mission footage. The first video was the Buggles \"Video Killed the Radio Star\". While only a handful of videos were available, and often played several times a day, it was not long before record executives understood the value of producing a video. This created a one-two effect, according to Tom Freston, where exposure on MTV could lead to more radio airplay and consequently record sales. The ability of MTV to influence record sales, combined with the \"I Want My MTV\" campaign, led to most cable operators picking up the independent network.\n\nSeveral interviews reveal the artistic side of music video production, the reluctance of some artists to enter the fray, and the artists that ultimately capitalized on the exposure MTV gave them. One example is Men at Work, a band that the record executives had few expectations. Their videos ultimately placed their album at number one for 16 weeks. Ultimately, the inability to have a video played on MTV could make or break an artist.\n\nThe book also chronicles the introduction of metal bands to MTV, the criticism that no African-American artists were featured, and how Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\" turned the video music world on its head.\nThe book concludes with an exploration of the end of programming focused on videos and the introduction of non-music programming, most notably \"The Real World.\"\n\nThis is a partial selection of the people interviewed or highlighted in the book who were instrumental to the creation of MTV:\n\n\nFilmmaker James Ponsoldt will write and direct the film adaptation of \"I Want My MTV\", which does not yet have a release date.\n\n\"I Want My MTV\" was named one of the Best Books of 2011 by NPR, Spin, USA Today, CNBC, Pitchfork, The Onion, The Atlantic, The Huffington Post, VEVO, the Boston Globe, and the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\n“As will be evident by now, \"I Want My MTV\" is compulsively entertaining, hugely edifying… and occasionally profound.” - Jessica Winter, \"Time\".\n\n“This is the perfect gift for that person in your life who won't shut up about MTV not playing music videos anymore. \"I Want My MTV\" is an oral history of the network's first 10 years, chronicling its conception, its launch, its unprecedented rise to power, and finally its almost wholesale abandonment of the music video format.” - Stephen Deusner, \"Pitchfork\".\n\n“I guarantee you'll have a tough time putting it down. Then, after you finish, your brain will be overloaded with random trivia to spout at dinner parties.” - Whitney Matheson, \"USA Today\".\n\n“The book is full of nostalgia and inside tidbits, with lots of bizarre stories about animals on video sets, such as the doves that may or may not have been sucked into a fan, chopped up and then splattered all over Prince during a long-ago video shoot… you will want this book.” - J.

{"id": "37688915", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37688915", "title": "Inside the Neolithic Mind", "text": "Inside the Neolithic Mind\n\nInside the Neolithic Mind: Consciousness, Cosmos and the Realm of the Gods is a cognitive archaeological study of Neolithic religious beliefs in Europe co-written by the archaeologists David Lewis-Williams and David Pearce, both of the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa. It was first published by Thames and Hudson in 2005. Following on from Lewis-Williams' earlier work, \"The Mind in the Cave\" (2002), the book discusses the role of human cognition in the development of religion and Neolithic art.\n\nThe premise of \"Inside the Neolithic Mind\" is that irrespective of cultural differences, all humans share in the ability to enter into altered states of consciousness, in which they experience entoptic phenomenon, which the authors discern as a three-stage process leading to visionary experiences. Arguing that such altered experiences have provided the background to religious beliefs and some artistic creativity throughout human history, they focus their attention on the Neolithic, or \"New Stone Age\" period, when across Europe, communities abandoned their nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyles and settled to become sedentary agriculturalists.\n\nAdopting case studies from the opposite ends of Neolithic Europe, Lewis-Williams and Pearce discuss the archaeological evidence from both the Near East – including such sites as Nevalı Çori, Göbekli Tepe and Çatalhöyük – and Atlantic Europe, including the sites of Newgrange, Knowth and Bryn Celli Ddu. The authors argue that these monuments illustrate the influence of altered states of consciousness in constructing cosmological views of a tiered universe, in doing so drawing ethnographic parallels with shamanistic cultures in Siberia and Amazonia.\n\nAcademic reviews published in such peer-reviewed journals as \"Antiquity\" were mixed. Critics argued that the use of evidence was selective, and that there was insufficient evidence for the authors' three-stage model of entopic phenomenon. Others praised the accessible and engaging writing style.\n\nIn their preface, Lewis-Williams and Pearce explain their approach, and their reasons for comparing megalithic art and archaeology from the Near East and Atlantic Europe. They express their opinion that such comparisons are made possible – despite the cultural and geographical differences – because of the \"universal functioning of the human brain\" which unites all \"Homo sapiens\" and leads different societies to develop similar religious and cosmological beliefs. \nChapter one, \"The Revolutionary Neolithic\", explores the background to this period of time, in which humans became increasingly sedentary and developed agriculture. Discussing the various different understandings of the Neolithic advocated within archaeology, they propose that it should be seen as a \"revolutionary\" period than as \"a revolution\" in itself, in this way challenging the view made famous by V. Gordon Childe. Moving on to an exploration of why humans adopted agriculture, they proclaim their adherence to Jacques Cauvin's concept of the Symbolic Revolution. From there, they discuss the role of religion, suggesting that it should be understood as a tripartite system uniting experience, practice and belief. This leads on to a discussion of some of the earliest archaeological evidence for the Neolithic, at Nevalı Çori and Göbekli Tepe, both in Southeastern Turkey, referring to the theory that the ritual beliefs practiced here resulted in the development of agriculture. Lewis-Williams and Pearce round off the chapter by quoting Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem \"Kubla Khan\", written after an experience in an altered state of consciousness.\n\nIn the second chapter, \"The Consciousness Contract\", the authors explore such altered states of consciousness, beginning with a discussion of the life and work of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Listing the symptoms of such altered states, they put forward their three-stage model for how the human brain experiences these states, and then interprets them as recognisable images. Chapter three, \"Seeing and Building a Cosmos\", proceeds to discuss early humanity's conceptions of cosmology, which the authors argue was probably divided into several tiered realms through which shamans were believed to traverse while in an altered state of consciousness. They follow this with a discussion of the shamanic symbolism of the eye, drawing comparisons with the eyes in the clay statues from 'Ain Ghazal and the plastered skulls from other Near Eastern sites. Chapter four, \"Close Encounters with a Built Cosmos\", examines two Neolithic settlements in the Near East – 'Ain Ghazal and Çatalhöyük – and argues that their layout and design may have reflected shamanistic conceptions of cosmology. In doing so, the authors draw parallels with the ethnographically-recorded Barasana people of Amazonia, whose \"maloca\" buildings were understood as cosmological microcosms.\n\nIn the fifth chapter, \"Domesticating Wild Nature\", the authors seek to explore how the people of the Neolithic Near East might have understood the concepts of \"death\", \"birth\" and the \"wild\", drawing on ethnographic examples from various recorded shamanistic societies in order to do so. Chapter six, \"Treasure the Dream Whatever the Terror\", discusses how aspects of consciousness and cosmology can make their way into myth, expanding on the problematic nature of defining \"myth\". Turning to the structuralist ideas of anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss, they discuss Lévi-Strauss's ideas of neurologically based \"mythemes\" that provided the building blocks for myths; although rejecting his structuralism, they concur that there is a neuropsychological \"deep structure\" behind mythology, and proceed to compare the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" with a Samoyed narrative, \"The Cave of the Reindeer Woman.\"\n\nThe seventh chapter, \"The Mound in the Dark Grove\", turns its attention to Atlantic Europe, on the western end of the continent. Opening with a reference to William Blake, the authors focus their attention on two Early Neolithic tombs on the island of Anglesey off the Welsh coast: Bryn Celli Ddu and Barclodiad y Gawres. Chapter eight, \"Brú na Bóinne\", examines the valley of the same name in County Meath, Ireland, the home to a number of Early Neolithic tombs. Lewis-Williams and Pearce turn their attention to the most prominent two, Newgrange and Knowth, arguing that their architectural designs reflect cosmological views of the world influenced by altered states of consciousness.\n\nIn the penultimate chapter, \"Religion de Profunais\", the authors examine a number of recurring features in Neolithic Western Europe which they believe can shed light on the religious beliefs of the period. Exploring ritual elements to the act of flint mining at such sites as Grimes Graves, they discuss the potential shamanic symbolism of quartz. From there, they look at the art motifs found at sites in this part of the continent, highlighting the argument of Dronfield that such motifs were an attempt to depict entopic phenomenon, in doing so drawing ethnographic parallels with the artworks created by shamans among the Tukano people of Amazonia. The concluding chapter, \"East is East and West is West\", discusses the authors' views on the potential of their theory, making reference to Hawkes' ladder of inference and arguing for the need to consider emic perspectives when dealing with past societies.\n\nSusan A. Johnston of George Washington University reviewed the book for the \"American Anthropologist\" journal, in which she noted that many of the authors' analyses were \"interesting, and sometimes quite new and innovative.\" However, she also felt that there was a disconnection between the theoretical underpinnings to the tome and the analyses that followed; noting that while they were trying to avoid the neurological determinism which had been critiqued by Paul Bahn and Patricia Helvenston in their \"Waking the Trance Fixed\" (2005), she nevertheless thought their approach similar to it. Ultimately acknowledging that the analysis on offer do not require the neurological backing that the authors provide, Johnston suggested that the contemporary preoccupation with rooting archaeological interpretations in \"biological reality\" was a part of the \"21st-century mind\".\n\nThe \"Antiquity\" journal published a review of \"Inside the Neolithic Mind\" authored by Chris Scarre of Durham University, in which he noted the controversial nature of Lewis-Williams' \"three stages of trance\" model, proclaiming that those already unconvinced by the theory will get little from the new book. Scarre noted that inevitably, there was \"much to question and to applaud\" in the work, before highlighting that the use of evidence was selective, and that the art on the Breton megaliths was not included. \"American Scientist\" published a review authored by Brian D. Hayden of Simon Fraser University, in which he described it as a \"very enjoyable\" book, praising the book's vignettes as making it \"eminently readable\". Although remarking that the authors' \"endorse cognitive interpretations that are quite different from the more economic and practical interpretations that I generally favor\", Hayden nevertheless commented that he agreed with their basic premise. He comments that while some of their assertions do seem plausible, others – for instance their claims that the idea of a tiered cosmos has a neurological basis – are less so, being the sort of \"speculative indulgences\" that he believes typify \"English archaeology\". Moving on to discuss the authors' views on the relationship between altered states of consciousness and power elites, he expresses his disagreement with them, noting that \"the issues of domestication and the emergence of socioeconomic complexity are poorly served by cognitively based explanations.\"\n\nDavid S. Webster of Durham University's Archaeological Services reviewed the work for the \"European Journal of Archaeology\" in which he highlighted its \"popular tone and style\" and use of the \"contentious\" three mode-model of trance states, a model he dismisses as a \"myth\". In \"Archaeology\", the publication of the Archaeological Institute of America, Michael Balter positively reviewed \"Inside the Neolithic Mind\", praising its \"superb writing\" and \"lavishly illustrated descriptions\" of archaeological sites. Although he notes that most archaeologists would concur that Neolithic people probably believed in a spirit world, he expressed his belief that \"they may balk at the idea\" that the act of climbing down step ladders at Çatalhöyük symbolized the descent into the underworld or that hearths in the floors of 'Ain Ghazal symbolized the transformation of fire, rather than the remnants of cookery. He also noted that archaeologists would be more receptive to their idea that geometric patterns on European megaliths have parallels with similarities in Southern Africa and California. Concluding his review, Balter remarked that the authors \"can be assured that their foray into the Neolithic mind will not be ignored.\"\n\n"}

It is held every year on the first Sunday of May. The Jongmyo rite is usually accompanied with the court music playing (\"Jerye-ak\") and dance called \"Ilmu\" or \"line Dance\". Jongmyo Jerye and Jeryeak were designated as the first of South Korea's Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO in 2001.\n\nThe Jongmyo rites originated from Ancient China. These rituals were seen as essential to the preservation and continued prosperity of the state and so each dynasty in China and Korea placed a great deal of importance in them which can be seen from Confucian texts and the very mention of 'preserving the Sacred Shrines' whenever there was talk about the state being in peril. The ceremonies reinforce the Confucian link between ancestors and their descendants, parent and child, essentially the family; the act of communing with them is a prayer and invocation for the ancestors for the preservation and good health of the state.\n\nThey were practised in Korea for the first time in Silla era and preserved from the Goryeo Dynasty to the last Korean Dynasty of Joseon. Along with the ceremony for praying to the Gods of Earth for bountiful crops, it is considered Korea's highest-ranked rites. These practices have been lost in China due to the abolition of the monarchy but Korea still preserved it well after their own monarchy was abolished.\n\nThe current ceremonies are organised and performed by the descendants of the former royal family, the Korean Imperial Household, with assistance from other cultural organisations. The King's role is played by a senior member of the Household, usually the Hereditary Prince Imperial of Korea, who technically would have performed the same rites if Korea was at present a monarchy (the former kings being his actual ancestors).\n\nThe Jerye procedures were divided into three parts. It is regarded as Korea's highest-ranked ritual, so it was held strictly and solemnly. The first part is the procedures to invite and greet the spirits. Most of the rites are held by king, officiants and his family. The first part's procedures are \"jagye\" (purification). \"Chwiwi\" is the part when the king and choheongwan (people who bring the wine for offering rituals) take the position into the chamber of the shrine. Then they wash their hands for greeting the spirits (\"gwansewi\"). In the \"Cheonghaengrye\" and \"Singwanrye\" rituals, they begin the rite of greeting the gods of Heaven and Earth by offering wine.\n\nThe second is rituals for entertaining the spirits. It is started the rites of \"Jinchan\", which serves 63 kinds of foods to the spirits. Then the king begin to serve the first wine offering to the ancestral rites (\"Choheonrye\") followed by Aheongwan (Crown Prince) and Jongheongwan (Prime Minister). This ritual is followed by rite of reciting the prayer paper by people called Daechukgwan. \"Aheonrye\" and \"Jongheonrye\" are the rites of the second and third (last) of wine offering.\n\nThe third part is the last rites which are held to send off the spirits to heaven. \"Eumbok\" is an occasion of sharing foods and wine to the officiants. The \"Cheonbyeondu\" is the rite of removing all the foods served for the spirits. In \"Songsin\", the Choheongwan and other officiants bows four times to send off the spirits to heaven. \"Mangryorye\" is the last rite held by burning the prayer papers and the king is reported by the Heongwan and Daechukgwan that the rituals and services are completed and all the officiants withdraw.\n\nDuring the rituals of Jerye, it were held together with the court music playing (\"Jerye-ak\") to bring an enjoyment for the spirits invited into the rites. Jerye-ak compositions played in the rites were Botaepyeong and Jeongdaeeop. There were also songs that accompanied the jerye-ak, named Jongmyo Akjang.\n\nAn elaborate performance of ancient court music (with accompanying dance) known as \"Jongmyo jeryeak\" (hangul: 종묘제례악; hanja: 宗廟祭禮樂) is performed there each year. Musicians, dancers, and scholars would perform Confucian rituals, such as the Jongmyo Daeje (Royal Shrine Ritual) in the courtyard five times a year. . Today the rituals have been reconstructed and revived. The Jongmyo Daeje has been designated as Important Intangible Cultural Property No. 56 and is performed every year in May. . The \"Jongmyo Jerye-ak\", the traditional court music of Joseon, is performed by the Royal Court Orchestra and has been designated as Important Intangible Cultural Property No. 1.. This court music has its origins in Chinese court music that was brought to Korea during the Goryeo period. . King Sejong composed new music for the ritual based largely on \"hyangak\" (with some \"dangak\") in 1447 and 1462. .\n\nThe Jerye's dance is called \"Ilmu\" (line dance). Ilmu divided into Botaepyeong-ji-mu (dance to praise achievements of the former kings), and Jeongdaeeop-ji-mu, (dance to praise the king's military achievements). Ilmu dances are performed by a group of 64 women dancers wearing purpled-clothing dance. They called Palilmu because they dance in 8 lines and rows.\n\nIlmu divided into two types of dance, \"Munmu\" and \"Mumu\". Munmu means the \"civil dance\" and is accompanied by Botaepyeong-ji-ak, with Yak (a three-holed bamboo flute) in the left hand and Jeok (a pheasant-feather tasseled wooden bar) in the right hand. Mumu is a military dance. The dancers move quickly by holding wooden swords and the rear four rows wooden spears in the front four rows.\n\n"}

{"id": "215522", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=215522", "title": "L'Age d'Or", "text": "L'Age d'Or\n\nL'Age d'Or (, ), commonly translated as The Golden Age or Age of Gold, is a 1930 French surrealist satirical comedy film directed by Luis Buñuel about the insanities of modern life, the hypocrisy of the sexual mores of bourgeois society and the value system of the Roman Catholic Church. The screenplay is by Salvador Dalí and Buñuel. \"L'Age d'Or\" was one of the first sound films made in France, along with \"Prix de Beauté\" and \"Under the Roofs of Paris\".\n\nThe first scene of the film is a documentary about scorpions. After that, the film is a series of vignettes, wherein a couple's attempts at consummating their romantic relationship are continually thwarted by the bourgeois values and sexual mores of family, church, and society.\n\nThe couple are first seen creating a disturbance by making love in the mud during a religious ceremony. The man is apprehended and led away by two men who struggle to control their captive's sudden impulses. He momentarily breaks free long enough to kick a small dog. Later he struggles free to aggressively crush a beetle with his shoe. As he is escorted through city streets, he sees an advertisement that inspires him to fantasize a woman's hand rubbing herself, and becomes transfixed by another advertisement showing a woman's legs in silk stockings. He eventually escapes his handlers, inexplicably assaults a blind man standing at a curb, and gets into a taxi.\n\nMeanwhile, the woman is at home, where she tells her mother she hurt her finger, which is wrapped in a bandage that disappears and reappears from scene to scene. The woman and her parents attend a party where the guests seem oblivious to alarming or incongruous events in their midst: a maid screams and falls to the floor after emerging from a doorway where flames are visible; a horse-drawn cart filled with rowdy men drinking from large bottles passes through the elegant company in the ballroom; the father converses with guests while ignoring several flies on his face; a small boy is shot and killed for a minor prank.\n\nThe man arrives at the party and sees his lover from across the room. He behaves brusquely toward the other guests while looking ardently in the woman's direction, and she looks longingly at him. The woman's mother hands the man a drink, but spills a drop on his hand. He becomes enraged and slaps her, which seems to excite the daughter. Seeking sexual release and satisfaction, the couple go into the garden and make love next to a marble statue, while the rest of the party guests assemble outdoors for an orchestral performance of \"Liebestod\". When the man is called away to answer a telephone call, the woman sublimates her sexual passion by fellating the toe of the statue until the man returns.\n\nThe \"Liebestod\" music stops abruptly when the conductor, his hands gripping his head, walks away, and wanders into the garden where the couple are. The woman runs to comfort the elderly conductor before finally French kissing him. The man stands up, bumping his head on a hanging flower pot, and grasps his head in pain as he leaves the garden. He stumbles away to her bedroom where he throws a burning tree, a bishop, a plow, the bishop's staff, a giraffe statue and handfuls of pillow feathers out the window.\n\nThe final vignette is an allusion to the Marquis de Sade's novel \"The 120 Days of Sodom\"; the intertitle reads: \"120 Days of Depraved Acts\", about an orgy in a castle, wherein the surviving orgiasts are ready to emerge to the light of mainstream society. From the castle door emerges the bearded and berobed Duc de Blangis (a character from de Sade's novel) who greatly resembles Jesus, the Christ, who comforts a young woman who has run out from the castle, before he takes her back inside. Afterwards, a woman's scream is heard, and only the Duc re-emerges; and he is beardless. The concluding image is a Christian cross festooned with the scalps of women; to the accompaniment of jovial music, the scalps sway in the wind.\n\n\n\"L'Age d'Or\" began as the second artistic collaboration between Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí, who had fallen out by the time of the film's production. A neophyte cinéast, Buñuel overcame his ignorance of cinematic production technique by sequentially filming most of the screenplay; the 63-minute movie is composed of almost every meter of film exposed and dramatic sequence photographed.\n\nThe production budget was a million francs, and was financed and produced by the Vicomte Charles de Noailles (1891–1981), a nobleman who, beginning in 1928, yearly commissioned a film as a birthday gift to his wife, the Vicomtesse Marie-Laure de Noailles (1902–1970), who was a renowned patroness of the arts and of artists, such as Dalí and Buñuel, Balthus, Jean Cocteau, Man Ray, Francis Poulenc, Jean Hugo, Jean-Michel Frank and others.\n\n\"L'Age d'Or\" included actors who were famous artists, such as Max Ernst and Josep Llorens Artigas.\n\nUpon receiving a cinematic exhibition permit from the Board of Censors, \"L'Age d'Or\" had its premiere presentation at Studio 28, Paris, on 29 November 1930. Later, on 3 December 1930, the great popular success of the film provoked attacks by the right-wing \"Ligue des Patriotes\" (League of Patriots), whose angry viewers took umbrage at the visual statements made by Buñuel and Dalí. The reactionary French \"Patriots\" interrupted the screening by throwing ink at the cinema screen and assaulting viewers who opposed them. They then went to the lobby and destroyed art works by Dalí, Joan Miró, Man Ray, Yves Tanguy, and others. On 10 December 1930, the Prefect of Police of Paris, Jean Chiappe, arranged to have the film banned from further public exhibition after the Board of Censors re-reviewed the film.\n\nA contemporary right-wing Spanish newspaper published a condemnation of the film and of Buñuel and Dalí, which described the content of the film as \"...the most repulsive corruption of our age ... the new poison which Judaism, Masonry, and rabid, revolutionary sectarianism want to use in order to corrupt the people\". In response, the de Noailles family withdrew \"L'Age d'Or\" from commercial distribution and public exhibition for more than forty years; nonetheless, three years later, in 1933, the film was privately exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art, in New York City. Forty-nine years later, from 1–15 November 1979, the film had its legal U.S. premiere at the Roxie Cinema in San Francisco.\n\nThe film critic Robert Short said that the scalp-decorated crucifix and the scenes of socially repressive violence, wherein the love-struck protagonist is manhandled by two men, indicate that the social and psychological repression of the libido and of romantic passion and emotion, by the sexual mores of bourgeois society and by the value system of the Roman Catholic Church, breed violence in the relations among people, and violence by men against women.\n\nToday, \"L'Age d'Or\" is widely regarded as one of the key works of surrealist cinema. British critic Philip French noted that the film, alongside Buñuel's \"Un Chien Andalou\" (1929), featured \"bizarre sequences that assault bourgeois values and sexual oppression while making no logical sense, and they were acclaimed by the leading arbiters of surrealism as the first authentic surrealist films.\" In the British Film Institute's 2012 \"Sight & Sound\" polls, 15 critics and six directors named \"L'Age d'Or\" one of their 10 favorite films in history. Ed Gonzalez of \"Slant\" analyzed the film's sound design in relation to his argument that Buñuel's overriding message is the ability of love to \"conquer all sorts of moral restraints.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes reports an average rating of 8.8/10 among 25 critics, with 92% approval overall. The aggregation site \"They Shoot Pictures, Don't They\" has since found \"L'Age d'Or\" to be the 120th most acclaimed film ever made.\n\n"}

{"id": "44928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44928", "title": "Mahogany", "text": "Mahogany\n\nMahogany is a kind of wood—the straight-grained, reddish-brown timber of three tropical hardwood species of the genus \"Swietenia\", indigenous to the Americas and part of the pantropical chinaberry family, Meliaceae.\n\nThe three species are:\n\nWhile the three \"Swietenia\" species are classified officially as \"genuine mahogany\", other Meliaceae species with timber uses are classified as \"true mahogany.\" (Only members of the genus Swietenia can be called \"genuine mahogany.\") Some may or may not have the word mahogany in their trade or common name. Some of these true mahoganies include the African genera \"Khaya\" (African mahogany) and \"Entandrophragma\" (sapele mahogany); New Zealand mahogany or kohekohe (\"Dysoxylum spectabile\"); Chinese mahogany, \"Toona sinensis\"; Indonesian mahogany, \"Toona sureni\"; Indian mahogany, \"Toona ciliata\"; Chinaberry, \"Melia azedarach\"; Pink Mahogany (or Bosse), \"Guarea\"; Chittagong (also known as Indian Mahogany), \"Chukrasia velutina\"; and Crabwood \"Carapa guianensis\". Some members of the genus \"Shorea\" (Meranti, Balau, or Lauan) of the family Dipterocarpaceae are also sometimes sold as Philippine mahogany, although the name is more properly applied to another species of Toona, \"Toona calantas\".\nMahogany is a commercially important lumber prized for its beauty, durability, and color, and used for paneling and to make furniture, boats, musical instruments and other items. The leading importer of mahogany is the United States, followed by Britain; while the largest exporter today is Peru, which surpassed Brazil after that country banned mahogany exports in 2001. It is estimated that some 80 or 90 percent of Peruvian mahogany exported to the United States is illegally harvested, with the economic cost of illegal logging in Peru placed conservatively at $40–70 million USD annually. It was estimated that in 2000, some 57,000 mahogany trees were harvested to supply the U.S. furniture trade alone.\n\nMahogany is the national tree of the Dominican Republic and Belize. A mahogany tree with two woodcutters bearing an axe and a paddle also appears on the Belizean national coat of arms, under the national motto, \"Sub umbra floreo\", Latin for \"under the shade I flourish.\"\n\nSpecific gravity of mahogany is 0.55. \n\nThe natural distribution of these species within the Americas is geographically distinct. \"S. mahagoni\" grows on the West Indian islands as far north as the Bahamas, the Florida Keys and parts of Florida; \"S. humilis\" grows in the dry regions of the Pacific coast of Central America from south-western Mexico to Costa Rica; \"S. macrophylla\" grows in Central America from Yucatan southwards and into South America, extending as far as Peru, Bolivia and extreme western Brazil. In the 20th century various botanists attempted to further define \"S. macrophylla\" in South America as a new species, such as \"S. candollei\" Pittier and \"S. tessmannii\" Harms., but many authorities consider these spurious. According to Record and Hess, all of the mahogany of continental North and South America can be considered as one botanical species, \"Swietenia macrophylla\" King.\n\nThe name mahogany was initially associated only with those islands in the West Indies under British control (French colonists used the term \"acajou\", while in the Spanish territories it was called \"caoba\"). The origin of the name is uncertain, but it could be a corruption of 'm'oganwo', the name used by the Yoruba and Ibo people of West Africa to describe trees of the genus \"Khaya\", which is closely related to \"Swietenia\". When transported to Jamaica as slaves, they gave the same name to the similar trees they saw there. Though this interpretation has been disputed, no one has suggested a more plausible origin. The indigenous Arawak name for the tree is not known. In 1671 the word mahogany appeared in print for the first time, in John Ogilby's \"America\". Among botanists and naturalists, however, the tree was considered a type of cedar, and in 1759 was classified by Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778) as \"Cedrela mahagoni\". The following year it was assigned to a new genus by Nicholas Joseph Jacquin (1727–1817), and named \"Swietenia mahagoni\".\n\nUntil the 19th century all of the mahogany was regarded as one species, although varying in quality and character according to soil and climate. In 1836 the German botanist Joseph Gerhard Zuccarini (1797–1848) identified a second species while working on specimens collected on the Pacific coast of Mexico, and named it \"Swietenia humilis\". In 1886 a third species, \"Swietenia macrophylla\", was named by Sir George King (1840–1909) after studying specimens of Honduras mahogany planted in the Botanic Gardens in Calcutta, India. Today, all species of \"Swietenia\" grown in their native locations are listed by CITES, and are therefore protected. Both \"Swietenia mahagoni\", and \"Swietenia macrophylla\" were introduced into several Asian countries at the time of the restrictions imposed on American mahogany in the late 1990s and both are now successfully grown and harvested in plantations in those countries. A small percentage of global supply of genuine mahogany comes from these Asian plantations, notably from India, Bangladesh, Indonesia and from Fiji, in Oceania. For \"Swietenia macrophylla\", the trees in these plantations are still relatively young compared to the trees being harvested from old growth forests in South America. Thus, the illegal trade of bigleaf mahogany continues apace.\n\nSpecies of \"Swietenia\" cross-fertilise readily when they grow in proximity; the hybrid between \"S. mahagoni\" and \"S. macrophylla\" is widely planted for its timber.\n\nIn addition, the U.S. timber trade also markets various other Federal Trade Commission-defined species as \"mahoganies\" under a variety of different commercial names, most notably \"Philippine mahogany\", which is actually from the genus \"Shorea\", a dipterocarp. This wood is also called \"Lauan\" or \"Meranti\".\n\nIn the 17th century, the buccaneer John Esquemeling recorded the use of mahogany or cedrela on Hispaniola for making canoes: \"The Indians make these canoes without the use of any iron instruments, by only burning the trees at the bottom near the root, and afterwards governing the fire with such industry that nothing is burnt more than what they would have...\"\n\nThe wood first came to the notice of Europeans with the beginning of Spanish colonisation in the Americas. A cross in the Cathedral at Santo Domingo, bearing the date 1514, is said to be mahogany, and Phillip II of Spain apparently used the wood for the interior joinery of the Escorial Palace, begun in 1584. However, \"caoba\", as the Spanish called the wood, was principally reserved for ship building, and it was declared a royal monopoly at Havana in 1622. Hence very little of the mahogany growing in Spanish controlled territory found its way to Europe.\n\nAfter the French established a colony in Saint Domingue (now Haiti), some mahogany from that island probably found its way to France, where joiners in the port cities of Saint-Malo, Nantes, La Rochelle and Bordeaux used the wood to a limited extent from about 1700. On the English-controlled islands, especially Jamaica and the Bahamas, mahogany was abundant but not exported in any quantity before 1700.\n\nWhile the trade in mahogany from the Spanish and French territories in America remained moribund for most of the 18th century, this was not true for those islands under British control. In 1721 the British Parliament removed all import duties from timber imported into Britain from British possessions in the Americas. This immediately stimulated the trade in West Indian timbers including, most importantly, mahogany. Importations of mahogany into England (and excluding those to Scotland, which were recorded separately) reached 525 tons per annum by 1740, 3,688 tons by 1750, and more than 30,000 tons in 1788, the peak year of the 18th century trade.\n\nAt the same time, the 1721 Act had the effect of substantially increasing exports of mahogany from the West Indies to the British colonies in North America. Although initially regarded as a joinery wood, mahogany rapidly became the timber of choice for makers of high quality furniture in both the British Isles and the 13 colonies of North America.\nUntil the 1760s over 90 per cent of the mahogany imported into Britain came from Jamaica. Some of this was re-exported to continental Europe, but most was used by British furniture makers. Quantities of Jamaican mahogany also went to the North American colonies, but most of the wood used in American furniture came from the Bahamas. This was sometimes called Providence wood, after the main port of the islands, but more often \"madera\" or \"maderah\", which was the Bahamian name for mahogany.\n\nIn addition to Jamaica and Bahamas, all the British controlled islands exported some mahogany at various times, but the quantities were not large. The most significant third source was Black River and adjacent areas on the Mosquito Coast (now Republic of Honduras), from where quantities of mahogany were shipped from the 1740s onwards. This mahogany was known as 'Rattan mahogany', after the island of Ruatan, which was the main offshore entrepot for the British settlers in the area.\n\nAt the end of the Seven Years' War (1756–63), the mahogany trade began to change significantly. During the occupation of Havana by British forces between August 1762 and July 1763, quantities of Cuban or Havanna mahogany were sent to Britain, and after the city was restored to Spain in 1763, Cuba continued to export small quantities, mostly to ports on the north coast of Jamaica, from where it went to Britain. However, this mahogany was regarded as inferior to the Jamaican variety, and the trade remained sporadic until the 19th century.\n\nAnother variety new to the market was Hispaniola mahogany, also called 'Spanish' and 'St Domingo' mahogany. This was the result of the 1766 Free Ports Act, which opened Kingston and other designated Jamaican ports to foreign vessels for the first time. The object was primarily to encourage importations of cotton from French plantations in Saint Domingue, but quantities of high quality mahogany were also shipped. These were then forwarded to Britain, where they entered the market in the late 1760s.\n\nIn terms of quantity, the most significant new addition to the mahogany trade was Honduras mahogany, also called 'baywood', after the Bay of Honduras. British settlers had been active in southern Yucatan since the beginning of the 18th century, despite the opposition of the Spanish, who claimed sovereignty over all of Central America.\n\nTheir main occupation was cutting logwood, a dyewood in high demand in Europe. The centre of their activity and the primary point of export was Belize. Under Article XVII of the Treaty of Paris (1763), British cutters were for the first time given the right to cut logwood in Yucatan unmolested, within agreed limits. Such was the enthusiasm of the cutters that within a few years the European market was glutted, and the price of logwood collapsed.\n\nHowever, the price of mahogany was still high after the war, and so the cutters turned to cutting mahogany. The first Honduras mahogany arrived in Kingston, Jamaica, in November 1763, and the first shipments arrived in Britain the following year.\n\nBy the 1790s most of the viable stocks of mahogany in Jamaica had been cut, and the market was divided between two principal sources or types of mahogany. Honduras mahogany was relatively cheap, plentiful, but rarely of the best quality. Hispaniola (also called Spanish or Santo Domingo) mahogany was the wood of choice for high quality work.\n\nData are lacking, but it is likely that the newly independent United States now received a good proportion of its mahogany from Cuba. In the last quarter of the 18th century France began to use mahogany more widely; they had ample supplies of high quality wood from Saint Domingue. The rest of Europe, where the wood was increasingly fashionable, obtained most of their wood from Britain.\n\nThe French Revolution of 1789 and the wars that followed radically changed the mahogany trade, primarily due to the progressive collapse of the French and Spanish colonial empires, which allowed British traders into areas previously closed to them. Saint Domingue became the independent republic of Haiti, and from 1808, Spanish controlled Santo Domingo and Cuba were both open to British vessels for the first time.\n\nFrom the 1820s mahogany from all these areas was imported into Europe and North America, with the lion's share going to Britain. In Central America British loggers moved northwest towards Mexico and south into Guatemala. Other areas of Central America as far south as Panama also began to be exploited.\n\nThe most important new development was the beginning of large scale logging in Mexico from the 1860s. Most mahogany was cut in the province of Tabasco and exported from a number of ports on the Gulf of Campeche, from Vera Cruz eastwards to Campeche and Sisal. By the end of the 19th century there was scarcely any part of Central America within reach of the coast untouched by logging, and activity also extended into Colombia, Venezuela, Peru and Brazil.\n\nTrade in American mahogany probably reached a peak in the last quarter of the 19th century. Figures are not available for all countries, but Britain alone imported more than 80,000 tons in 1875. This figure was not matched again. From the 1880s, African mahogany (\"Khaya\" spp.), a related genus, began to be exported in increasing quantities from West Africa, and by the early 20th century it dominated the market.\n\nIn 1907 the total of mahogany from all sources imported into Europe was 159,830 tons, of which 121,743 tons were from West Africa. By this time mahogany from Cuba, Haiti and other West Indian sources had become increasingly difficult to obtain in commercial sizes, and by the late 20th century Central American and even South American mahogany was heading in a similar direction. In 1975 \"S. humilis\" was placed on CITES Appendix II followed by \"S. mahagoni\" in 1992. The most abundant species, \"S. macrophylla\", was placed on Appendix III in 1995 and moved to Appendix II in 2003.\n\nMahogany has a straight, fine, and even grain, and is relatively free of voids and pockets. Its reddish-brown color darkens over time, and displays a reddish sheen when polished. It has excellent workability, and is very durable. Historically, the tree's girth allowed for wide boards from traditional mahogany species. These properties make it a favorable wood for crafting cabinets and furniture.\n\nMuch of the first-quality furniture made in the American colonies from the mid 18th century was made of mahogany, when the wood first became available to American craftsmen. Mahogany is still widely used for fine furniture; however, the rarity of Cuban mahogany, the over-harvesting of Honduras and Brazilian mahogany, and the protests by indigenous peoples and environmental organizations from the 1980s into the 2000s, have diminished their use.\n\nMahogany also resists wood rot, making it attractive in boat construction and outdoor decking. It is a tonewood, often used for musical instruments, particularly the backs, sides and necks of acoustic guitars, electric guitar bodies, and drum shells because of its ability to produce a very deep, warm tone compared to other commonly used woods, such as maple or birch. Guitars featuring mahogany in their construction include Martin D-18, select Taylor Guitars, Gibson Guitars, Hagström. In the 1930s Gibson used the wood to make banjo necks as well, the RB, TB and PB style 3s and RB, TB and PB style 75s were most commonly fitted with mahogany necks.\n\nIn the Philippines, environmentalists are calling for an end to the planting of mahogany because of its negative impact on the environment and wildlife, including possibly causing soil acidification and no net benefit to wildlife.\n"}
{"id": "3657925", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3657925", "title": "Model-centered instruction", "text": "Model-centered instruction\n\nModel-centered instruction is a general theory of instructional design developed by Andrew S. Gibbons. This theory can be used to design individual and group instruction for all kinds of learning in any type of learning environment. In addition, this theory may be used to design instruction with a wide variety of technologies and many media delivery systems. \n\nThe theory of model-centered instruction is based on the assumption that the purpose of instruction is to help learners construct knowledge about objects and events in their environment. In the field of cognitive psychology, theorists assert that knowledge is represented and stored in human memory as dynamic, networked structures generally known as schema or mental models. This concept of mental models was incorporated by Gibbons into the theory of model-centered instruction. This theory is based on the assumption that learners construct mental models as they process information they have acquired through observations of or interactions with objects, events, and environments. Instructional designers can assist learners by (a) helping them focus attention on specific information about an object, event, or environment and (b) initiating events or activities designed to trigger learning processes.\n\nInstructional designers may guide learner attention by introducing learners to carefully selected objects and events that occur in certain environments. In some situations, it is not possible to have learners work with real objects, events, or environments. In these cases, instructional designers may create representations of the objects, events, or environments. These representations are called models. A model is a definition or representation of an object, event, or environment that includes some information regarding their properties, actions, or cause-effect relationships. Instructional designers may use a variety of models to help learners construct their own mental models. A model can take various mediated forms, from simple textual descriptions to complex, multimedia simulations. \n\nAccording to the theory of model-centered instruction, there are three types of models: (a) a natural or manufactured cause-effect system, (b) an environment in which one or more systems operate, or (c) an expert performance—a set of purposeful, goal-driven actions that causes changes within systems and environments. These three types of models — system, environment, and expert performance - form a comprehensive framework for the representation and communication of subject-matter information in any domain. \n\nWhen learners interact with complex objects or models, they sometimes need assistance in discovering and processing information. Instructional designers can guide learners by introducing problems to be solved in a sequence that may be partially or fully determined by the learner. Gibbons defines a problem as “a request for information about an incompletely known model. A problem is a request for the learner…to supply one or more of the model’s behaviors, elements, or interrelations that are missing”. Problems act as filters or masks that focus learner attention on specific information about the objects or models. Problems also trigger learning processes used in the construction of mental models. As problems are solved in sequence, learners process more information and construct more comprehensive and useful mental models.\n\nGibbons has defined seven principles that summarize the general design prescriptions of model-centered instruction. These principles are related to the overall instructional purposes, subject-matter content, and instructional strategies of model-centered instruction. Key ideas related to designing, selecting, and sequencing problems can also be found in these principles. In addition, these principles provide guidance in how to provide supportive information, physical materials, tools, and personalized assistance to the learner. These principles, as defined by Gibbons, are listed below.\n\n1. Experience: Learners should be given maximum opportunity to interact for learning purposes with one or more systems or models of systems of three types: environment, system, and/or expert performance. The terms model and simulation are not synonymous; models can be expressed in a variety of computer-based and non-computer-based forms.\n\n2. Problem solving: Interaction with systems or models should be focused by the solution of one or more carefully selected problems, expressed in terms of the model, with solutions being performed by the learner, by a peer, or by an expert.\n\n3. Denaturing: Models are necessarily denatured from the real by the medium in which they are expressed. Designers must select a level of denaturing matching the target learner’s existing knowledge and goals.\n\n4. Sequence: Problems should be arranged in a carefully constructed sequence for modeled solution or for active learner solution.\n\n5. Goal orientation: Problems selected should be appropriate for the attainment of specific instructional goals.\n\n6. Resourcing: The learner should be given problem solving information resources, materials, and tools within a solution environment (which may exist only in the learner’s mind) commensurate with instructional goals and existing levels of knowledge.\n\n7. Instructional augmentation: The learner should be given support during solving in the form of dynamic, specialized, designed instructional augmentations.\n"}

{"id": "217662", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=217662", "title": "Music therapy", "text": "Music therapy\n\nMusic therapy is the use of music to improve health or functional outcomes. Music therapy is a creative arts therapy, consisting of a process in which a music therapist uses music and all of its facets—physical, emotional, mental, social, aesthetic, and spiritual—to help clients improve their physical and mental health. Music therapists primarily help clients improve their health in several domains, such as cognitive functioning, motor skills, emotional development, communication, sensory, social skills, and quality of life by using both active and receptive music experiences such as improvisation, re-creation, composition, and listening and discussion of music to achieve treatment goals. There is a wide qualitative and quantitative research literature base. \nSome commonly found practices include developmental work (communication, motor skills, etc.) with individuals with special needs, songwriting and listening in reminiscence/orientation work with the elderly, processing and relaxation work, and rhythmic entrainment for physical rehabilitation in stroke victims. Music therapy is also used in some medical hospitals, cancer centers, schools, alcohol and drug recovery programs, psychiatric hospitals, and correctional facilities \n\nMusic has been found to be an effective tool for music therapists through extensive research. It is beneficial for any individual, both physically and mentally, through improved heart rate, reduced anxiety, stimulation of the brain, and improved learning. Music therapists use their techniques to help their patients in many areas, ranging from stress relief before and after surgeries, to neuropathologies such as Alzheimer's disease. One study found that children who listened to music while having an IV inserted into their arms showed less distress and felt less pain than the children who did not listen to music while having an IV inserted. Studies have been carried out on patients diagnosed different mental disorders such as anxiety, depression and schizophrenia and there has been a visible improvement in their mental health after the therapy.\n\nApproaches used in music therapy that have emerged from the field of music education include Orff-Schulwerk (Orff), Dalcroze eurhythmics, and Kodály method. Models that developed directly out of music therapy are neurologic music therapy (NMT), Nordoff-Robbins music therapy and the Bonny method of guided imagery and music.\n\nMusic therapists may work with individuals who have behavioral-emotional disorders. To meet the needs of this population, music therapists have taken current psychological theories and used them as a basis for different types of music therapy. Different models include behavioral therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and psychodynamic therapy. The therapist has an ongoing responsibility to evaluate the extent to which the client is achieving the goals of therapy and whether the methods of therapy being used are helping or hindering the client.\n\nOne therapy model based on neuroscience, called \"neurologic music therapy\" (NMT), is \"based on a neuroscience model of music perception and production, and the influence of music on functional changes in non-musical brain and behavior functions\". In other words, NMT studies how the brain is without music, how the brain is with music, measures the differences, and uses these differences to cause changes in the brain through music that will eventually affect the client non-musically. As Michael Thaut put it: \"The brain that engages in music is changed by engaging in music.\" NMT trains motor responses (i.e. tapping foot or fingers, head movement, etc.) to better help clients develop motor skills that help \"entrain the timing of muscle activation patterns\".\n\nThere are two fundamental types of music therapy: 'receptive music therapy', and 'active music therapy', which is sometimes called 'expressive music therapy'. Active music therapy engages clients or patients in the act of making vocal or instrumental music. Receptive music therapy guides patients or clients in listening to live or recorded music.\n\nReceptive music therapy involves listening to recorded or live music selected by a therapist. It can improve mood, decrease stress, pain, anxiety level, and enhance relaxation. While it doesn't affect disease, for instance, it can help with coping skills.\n\nRecipients engage in some form of music-making, whether it's singing or with instruments. Baylor, Scott, and White researchers are studying the effect of harmonica playing on patients with COPD in order to determine if they help improve lung function. In a nursing home in Japan, elderly are taught to play easy-to-use instruments in order to help overcome physical difficulties.\n\nPaul Nordoff, a Juilliard School graduate and Professor of Music, was a pianist and composer who, upon seeing disabled children respond so positively to music, gave up his academic career to further investigate the possibility of music as a means for therapy. Clive Robbins, a special educator, partnered with Nordoff for over 17 years in the exploration and research of music’s effects on disabled children—first in the United Kingdom, and then in the USA in the 1950s and 60s. Their pilot projects included placements at care units for autistic children and child psychiatry departments, where they put programs in place for children with mental disorders, emotional disturbances, developmental delays, and other handicaps. Their success at establishing a means of communication and relationship with autistic children at the University of Pennsylvania gave rise to the National Institutes of Health's first grant given of this nature, and the 5-year study \"Music therapy project for psychotic children under seven at the day care unit\" involved research, publication, training and treatment. Several publications, including \"Therapy in Music for Handicapped Children\", \"Creative Music Therapy\", \"Music Therapy in Special Education\", as well as instrumental and song books for children, were released during this time. Nordoff and Robbins's success became known globally in the mental health community, and they were invited to share their findings and offer training on an international tour that lasted several years. Funds were granted to support the founding of the Nordoff Robbins Music Therapy Centre in Great Britain in 1974, where a one-year graduate program for students was implemented. In the early eighties, a center was opened in Australia, and various programs and institutes for music therapy were founded in Germany and other countries. In the United States, the Nordoff-Robbins Center for Music Therapy was established at New York University in 1989.\n\nThe Nordoff-Robbins approach, based on the belief that everyone is capable of finding meaning in and benefitting from musical experience, is now practiced by hundreds of therapists internationally. It focuses on treatment through the creation of music by both therapist and client together. Various techniques are used to accommodate all capabilities so that even the most low functioning individuals are able to participate actively.\n\nDeveloped by Gertrude Orff at the Kindezentrum München, is another approach known as Orff Music Therapy. Both the clinical setting of social pediatrics as well as the Orff Schulwerk (schoolwork) approach in music education (developed by German composer Carl Orff) influence this method, which is used with children with developmental problems, delays and disabilities. The area of social pediatrics was developed after the Second World War in Germany by Theodor Hellbrügge, who understood that medicine alone could not meet the complex needs of developmentally disabled children. He consulted psychologists, occupational therapists and other mental healthcare professionals whose knowledge and skills could aid in the diagnostics and treatment of children. Gertrude Orff was asked to develop a form of therapy based on the Orff Schulwerk approach to support the emotional development of patients. Elements found in both the music therapy and education approaches include the understanding of holistic music presentation as involving word, sound and movement; the use of both music and play improvisation as providing a creative stimulus for the child to investigate and explore; Orff instrumentation, including keyboard instruments and percussion instruments as a means of participation and interaction in a therapeutic setting; and lastly, the multisensory aspects of music used by the therapist to meet the particular needs of the child, such as both feeling and hearing sound.\n\nCorresponding with the attitudes of humanistic psychology, the developmental potential of the child- as in the acknowledgement of their strengths as well as their handicaps, and the importance of the therapist- child relationship are central factors in Orff music therapy. Theoretical foundations are also influenced by the strong emphasis on social integration and the involvement of parents in the therapeutic process found in social paediatrics. Knowledge of developmental psychology puts into perspective how developmental disabilities influence the child, as do their social and familial environments. The basis for interaction in this method is known as \"responsive interaction\", in which the therapist meets the child at their level and responds according to their initiatives, combining both humanistic and developmental psychology philosophies. Involving the parents in this type of interaction, by having them participate directly or observe the therapist's techniques, equips the parents with ideas of how to interact appropriately with their child, thus fostering a positive parent-child relationship.\n\nMusic educator and therapist Helen Lindquist Bonny (1921 – May 25, 2010) developed an approach influenced by humanistic and transpersonal psychological views, known as the Bonny method of guided imagery in music (GIM). Guided imagery refers to a technique used in natural and alternative medicine that involves using mental imagery to help with the physiological and psychological ailments of patients. The practitioner often suggests a relaxing and focusing image and through the use of imagination and discussion, aims to find constructive solutions to manage their problems. Bonny applied this psychotherapeutic method to the field of music therapy by using music as the means of guiding the patient to a higher state of consciousness where healing and constructive self- awareness can take place. Music is considered a \"co-therapist\" because of its importance. GIM with children can be used in one-on-one or group settings, and involves relaxation techniques, identification and sharing of personal feeling states, and improvisation to discover the self, and foster growth. The choice of music is carefully selected for the client based on their musical preferences and the goals of the session. Usually a classical piece, it must reflect the age and attentional abilities of the child in length and genre, and a full explanation of the exercises must be offered at their level of understanding.\n\nThe use of guided imagery with autistic children has been found to decrease stereotypical behaviours and hyperactivity, increase attention and the ability to follow instructions, as well as increase self-initiated communication, both verbal and non-verbal.\n\nBonny (Bonny Method of Guided Imagery and Music) writes a lot about the different features of music types in the classical genre.\n\nClassical music can be multi-layered; melodic line, harmony structure and base line. All of these aspects work together with other things to create different layers of musical sound. Classical music is written in different forms: ternary form, sonata form, theme and variations, prelude and tone poem.\n\nIt is associated Baroque era. It is for therapy work; it forms a stable and safe musical container, where the repetition of the open section that is recognizable before the period of change.\n\nIt is associated with the Classical and Romantic era. It is composed of three parts: introduction, exposition, development and recapitulation (which may be in code).\n\nIt uses different eras of music composition. The melody may be played by different instruments; played in different register (high, medium, low). It might become elongated by making each note twice is original length or shortened by making each note half the length.\n\nIt is a short piece for an orchestra that is already completed. The most receptive music therapy is Debussy's Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun, also Faure's Pavane for a Dead Princess.\n\nThis one is also from Romantic Era and also in the 20th century. Ein Heldenleben (A Hero's Life) and Enchanted Lake are great examples of this.\n\nNew Age Music is the type of music that allows relaxation while drawing images like landscapes enhanced by computer generated sounds. Kobialkais a type of new age music that produces large volume music that has violins playing over the background of synthesizes sounds. It's often very relaxing because the quality is seamless.\n\nThis is average in character, and sometimes there are vocal selection involved in Celtic music, adding to the appeal of the song choice. An example would be the Watermark by Enya. 12 minutes maybe be able to cause deep relaxation.\n\nMeditative music has a diverse range of styles and instrumentation. Most of them have single-line melody of a wooden or pan-flute.\n\nTrance Music is the type of music that many musical therapists who work with adolescent-aged clients. Trance is a style of electronic dance music that was created in 1990s, and it has a tempo of 130 and 160 bpm. Trance music enhances a feeling of calmness despite the rapid pace.\n\nJazz Music came out in the early part of the twentieth, generally known as the music of black Americans. The blues is a slow kind of jazz music that is used gentle relaxation. Jazz music is a sedative in receptive music therapy methods. Examples would be I Got Rhythm by Louie Armstrong or In a Mellotone by Duke Ellington.\n\nMusic therapy may be used with adolescent populations to treat disorders usually diagnosed in adolescence, such as mood/anxiety disorders and eating disorders, or inappropriate behaviors, including suicide attempts, withdrawal from family, social isolation from peers, aggression, running away, and substance abuse. Goals in treating adolescents with music therapy, especially for those at high risk, often include: increased recognition and awareness of emotions and moods, improved decision-making skills, opportunities for creative self expression, decreased anxiety, increased self-confidence, improved self-esteem, and better listening skills.\n\nTwo main methods for music therapy in this age group are group meetings and individual sessions. Both methods may include listening to music, discussions concerning moods and emotions in or toward music, analyzing the meanings of specific songs, writing lyrics, composing music, performing music, and musical improvisation.\n\nPrivate individual sessions can provide personal attention and are most effective when the music used is preferred by the patient. Using music that an adolescent can relate to or connect with can be successful in helping adolescent patients view the therapist as a safe and trustworthy adult, and to engage in the therapeutic process with less resistance. Music therapy conducted in groups affords opportunities for an adolescent individual to feel a sense of belonging, to express their opinions, learn how to socialize and verbalize appropriately with peers, improve compromising skills, and develop tolerance and empathy. Group sessions emphasize cooperation and cohesion, and can be quite effective in working with adolescents.\n\nAssessment includes obtaining a full medical history, musical (ability to duplicate a melody or identify changes in rhythm, etc.) and nonmusical functioning (social, physical/motor, emotional, etc.).\n\nPremature infants are those born at 37 weeks or less gestational stage. They are subject to numerous health risks, such as abnormal breathing patterns, decreased body fat and muscle tissue, as well as feeding issues. The coordination for sucking and breathing is often not fully developed, making feeding a challenge. The improved developmental activity and behavioural status of premature infants when they are discharged from the NICU, is directly related to the stimulation programs and interventions they benefited from during hospitalization, such as music therapy.\n\nMusic is typically conducted by a musical therapist in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), with five main techniques designed to benefit premature infants:\n\nMusic therapy has multiple benefits which contribute to the maintenance of health and the drive toward rehabilitation for children. Advanced technology that can monitor cortical activity offers a look at how music engages and produces changes in the brain during the perception and production of musical stimuli. Music therapy, when used with other rehabilitation methods, has increased the success rate of sensorimotor, cognitive, and communicative rehabilitation.\nMusic therapy intervention programs can include an average of 18 sessions of treatment. The achievement of a physical rehabilitation goal relies on the child's existing motivation and feelings towards music and their commitment to engage in meaningful, rewarding efforts. Regaining full functioning also confides in the prognosis of recovery, the condition of the client, and the environmental resources available. Both techniques use systematic processes where the therapists assist the client by using musical experiences and connections that collaborate as a dynamic force of change toward rehabilitation.\n\nMusic has many calming and soothing properties that can be used as a sedative in rehabilitation. For example, a patient with chronic pain may decrease the physiological result of stress and draw attention away from the pain by focusing on music.\n\nMusic therapy used in child rehabilitation has had a substantial emphasis on sensorimotor development including; balance and position, locomotion, agility, mobility, range of motion, strength, laterality and directionality. Music motivate and can be an element of distraction. Rhythmic stimuli has been found to help balance training for those with a brain injury.\n\nSinging is a form of rehabilitation for neurological impairments. Neurological impairments following a brain injury can be in the form of apraxia – loss to perform purposeful movements, dysarthria, muscle control disturbances (due to damage of the central nervous system), aphasia (defect in expression causing distorted speech), or language comprehension. Singing training has been found to improve lung, speech clarity, and coordination of speech muscles, thus, accelerating rehabilitation of such neurological impairments. For example, melodic intonation therapy is the practice of communicating with others by singing to enhance speech or increase speech production by promoting socialization, and emotional expression.\n\nMusic therapy is thought to be helpful with children with autism spectrum by providing repetitive stimuli which aim to \"teach\" the brain other possible ways to respond that might be more useful as they grow older.\n\nAccording to a 2013 Cochrane review, listening to music may improve heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure in those with coronary heart disease (CHD).\n\nMusic has proven useful in the recovery of motor skills.\n\nAlzheimer's disease and other types of dementia are among the disorders most commonly treated with music therapy. Like many of the other disorders mentioned, some of the most common significant effects are seen in social behaviors, leading to improvements in interaction, conversation, and other such skills. A meta-study of over 330 subjects showed music therapy produces highly significant improvements to social behaviors, overt behaviors like wandering and restlessness, reductions in agitated behaviors, and improvements to cognitive defects, measured with reality orientation and face recognition tests. As with many studies of MT's effectiveness, these positive effects on Alzheimer's and other dementias are not homogeneous among all studies. The effectiveness of the treatment seems to be strongly dependent on the patient, the quality and length of treatment, and other similar factors.\n\nAnother meta-study examined the proposed neurological mechanisms behind music therapy's effects on these patients. Many authors suspect that music has a soothing effect on the patient by affecting how noise is perceived: music renders noise familiar, or buffers the patient from overwhelming or extraneous noise in their environment. Others suggest that music serves as a sort of mediator for social interactions, providing a vessel through which to interact with others without requiring much cognitive load.\n\nMelodic intonation therapy (MIT) is a method used by music therapists and speech-language pathologists to help people with communication disorders caused by damage to the left hemisphere of the brain by engaging the singing abilities and possibly engaging language-capable regions in the undamaged right hemisphere. \n\nBroca’s aphasia, or non-fluent aphasia, is a language disorder caused by damage to Broca’s area and surrounding regions in the left frontal lobe. Those with non-fluent aphasia are able to understand language fairly well, but they struggle with language production and syntax. \n\nWhile unable to speak fluently, patients with non-fluent aphasia are often able to sing words, phrases, and even sentences they cannot express otherwise. MIT harnesses the singing ability of patients with non-fluent aphasia as a means to improve their communication. Although its exact nature depends on the therapist, in general MIT relies on the use of intonation (the rising and falling of the voice) and rhythm (beat/speed) to train patients to produce phrases verbally. In MIT, common words and phrases are turned into melodic phrases, generally starting with two step sing-song patterns and eventually emulating typical speech intonation and rhythmic patterns. A therapist will usually begin by introducing an intonation to their patient through humming. They will accompany this humming with a rhythm produced by the tapping of the left hand. At the same time, the therapist will introduce a visual stimuli of the written phrase to be learned. The therapist then sings the phrase with the patient, and ideally the patient is eventually able to sing the phrase on their own. With much repetition and through a process of “inner-rehearsal” (practicing internally hearing one’s voice singing), a patient may eventually be able to produce the phrase verbally without singing. As the patient advances in therapy, the procedure can be adapted to give them more autonomy and to teach them more complex phrases. Through the use of MIT, a non-fluent aphasic patient can be taught numerous phrases which aid them to communicate and function during daily life. \n\nThe mechanisms of this success are yet to be fully understood. It is commonly agreed that while speech is lateralized mostly to the left hemisphere (for right-handed and most left-handed individuals), some speech functionality is also distributed in the right hemisphere. MIT is thought to stimulate these right language areas through the activation of music processing areas also in the right hemisphere Similarly, the rhythmic tapping of the left hand stimulates the right sensorimotor cortex in order to further engage the right hemisphere in language production. Overall, by stimulating the right hemisphere during language tasks, therapists hope to decrease dependence on the left hemisphere for language production.\n\nWhile results are somewhat contradictory, studies have in fact found increased right hemispheric activation in non-fluent aphasic patients after MIT. This change in activation has been interpreted as evidence of decreased dependence on the left hemisphere. There is debate, however, if changes in right hemispheric activation are part of the therapeutic process during/after MIT, or are simply a side effect of non-fluent aphasia. In hopes of making MIT more effective, researchers are continually studying the mechanisms of MIT and non-fluent aphasia.\n\nNeurological researchers Sparks, Helm, and Albert developed MIT in 1973.\n\nA 2016 meta-analysis-analysis on the use of music therapy in the treatment of schizophrenia found that the treatment effect was significantly better in the patients who received adjunct music therapy than in those who did not, in negative symptoms, mood symptoms, and also positive symptoms.\n\nA 2017 Cochrane review found that moderate- to low-quality evidence suggests that music therapy as an addition to standard care improves the global state, mental state (including negative and general symptoms), social functioning, and quality of life of people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like disorders. However, effects were inconsistent across studies and depended on the number of music therapy sessions as well as the quality of the music therapy provided.\n\nA 2017 review of studies of music therapy for children and adolescents with major depressive or anxiety disorders found that music-based interventions may be efficient in reducing the severity of internalizing symptoms in children and adolescents. There is moderate-quality evidence that music therapy added to treatment as usual is more effective than treatment as usual alone in people with depression.\n\nA 2017 theoretical review on the use of music therapy in post-traumatic stress disorder suggests that music therapy may be a useful therapeutic tool to reduce symptoms and improve functioning among individuals with trauma exposure and PTSD, though more rigorous empirical study is required.\n\nIn 1999, the first program for music therapy in Africa opened in Pretoria, South Africa. Research has shown that in Tanzania patients can receive palliative care for life-threatening illnesses directly after the diagnosis of these illnesses. This is different from many Western countries, because they reserve palliative care for patients who have an incurable illness. Music is also viewed differently between Africa and Western countries. In Western countries and a majority of other countries throughout the world, music is traditionally seen as entertainment whereas in many African cultures, music is used in recounting stories, celebrating life events, or sending messages.\n\nOne of the first groups known to heal with sound were the aboriginal people of Australia. The modern name of their healing tool is the didgeridoo, but it was originally called the yidaki. The yidaki produced sounds that are similar to the sound healing techniques used in modern day. For at least 40,000 years, the healing tool was believed to assist in healing \"broken bones, muscle tears and illnesses of every kind\".\nHowever, here are no reliable sources stating the didgeridoo's exact age. Archaeological studies of rock art in Northern Australia suggest that the people of the Kakadu region of the Northern Territory have been using the didgeridoo for less than 1,000 years, based on the dating of paintings on cave walls and shelters from this period. A clear rock painting in Ginga Wardelirrhmeng, on the northern edge of the Arnhem Land plateau, from the freshwater period (that had begun 1500 years ago) shows a didgeridoo player and two songmen participating in an Ubarr Ceremony.\nAustralia in 1949, music therapy (not clinical music therapy as understood today) was started through concerts organized by the Australian Red Cross along with a Red Cross Music Therapy Committee. The key Australian body, the Australian Music Therapy Association (AMTA), was founded in 1975.\n\nIn 1956, Fran Herman, one of Canada's music therapy pioneers, began a 'remedial music' program at the Home For Incurable Children, now known as the Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital, in Toronto. Her group 'The Wheelchair Players' continued until 1964, and is considered to be the first music therapy group project in Canada. Its production \"The Emperor's Nightingale\" was the subject of a documentary film.\n\nComposer/pianist Alfred Rosé, a professor at the University of Western Ontario, also pioneered the use of music therapy in London, Ontario at Westminster Hospital in 1952 and at the London Psychiatric Hospital in 1956.\n\nTwo other music therapy programs were initiated during the 1950s; one by Norma Sharpe at St. Thomas Psychiatric Hospital in St. Thomas, Ontario, and the other by Thérèse Pageau at the Hôpital St-Jean-de-Dieu (now Hôpital Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine) in Montreal.\n\nA conference in August 1974, organized by Norma Sharpe and six other music therapists, led to the founding of the Canadian Music Therapy Association, which was later renamed the Canadian Association for Music Therapy (CAMT). As of 2009, the organization had over 500 members.\n\nCanada's first music therapy training program was founded in 1976, at Capilano College (now Capilano University) in North Vancouver, by Nancy McMaster and Carolyn Kenny.\n\nNorway is widely recognised as an important country for music therapy research. Its two major research centres are the Center for Music and Health with the Norwegian Academy of Music in Oslo, and the Grieg Academy Centre for Music Therapy (GAMUT), at University of Bergen. The former was mostly developed by professor Even Ruud, while professor Brynjulf Stige is largely responsible for cultivating the latter. The centre in Bergen has 18 staff, including 2 professors and 4 associate professors, as well as lecturers and PhD students. Two of the field's major international research journals are based in Bergen: \"Nordic Journal for Music Therapy\" and \"\". Norway's main contribution to the field is mostly in the area of \"community music therapy\", which tends to be as much oriented toward social work as individual psychotherapy, and music therapy research from this country uses a wide variety of methods to examine diverse methods across an array of social contexts, including community centres, medical clinics, retirement homes, and prisons.\n\nMusic therapy has existed in its current form in the United States since 1944 when the first undergraduate degree program in the world was begun at Michigan State University and the first graduate degree program was established at the University of Kansas. The American Music Therapy Association (AMTA) was founded in 1998 as a merger between the National Association for Music Therapy (NAMT, founded in 1950) and the American Association for Music Therapy (AAMT, founded in 1971). Numerous other national organizations exist, such as the Institute for Music and Neurologic Function, Nordoff-Robbins Center For Music Therapy, and the Association for Music and Imagery. Music therapists use ideas from different disciplines such as speech and language, physical therapy, medicine, nursing, and education.\n\nA music therapy degree candidate can earn an undergraduate, master's or doctoral degree in music therapy. Many AMTA approved programs offer equivalency and certificate degrees in music therapy for students that have completed a degree in a related field. Some practicing music therapists have held PhDs in fields other than, but usually related to, music therapy. Recently, Temple University established a PhD program in music therapy. A music therapist typically incorporates music therapy techniques with broader clinical practices such as psychotherapy, rehabilitation, and other practices depending on client needs. Music therapy services rendered within the context of a social service, educational, or health care agency are often reimbursable by insurance and sources of funding for individuals with certain needs. Music therapy services have been identified as reimbursable under Medicaid, Medicare, private insurance plans and federal and state government programs.\n\nA degree in music therapy requires proficiency in guitar, piano, voice, music theory, music history, reading music, improvisation, as well as varying levels of skill in assessment, documentation, and other counseling and health care skills depending on the focus of the particular university's program. A music therapist may hold the designations CMT (Certified Music Therapist), ACMT (Advanced Certified Music Therapist), or RMT (Registered Music Therapist) – credentials previously conferred by the former national organizations AAMT and NAMT ; these credentials remain in force through 2020 and have not been available since 1998. The current credential available is MT-BC. To become board certified, a music therapist must complete a music therapy degree from an accredited AMTA program at a college or university, successfully complete a music therapy internship, and pass the Board Certification Examination in Music Therapy, administered through The Certification Board for Music Therapists. To maintain the credential, either 100 units of continuing education must be completed every five years, or the board exam must be retaken near the end of the five-year cycle. The units claimed for credit fall under the purview of the Certification Board for Music Therapists.\nNorth Dakota, Nevada and Georgia have established licenses for music therapists. In the State of New York, the License for Creative Arts Therapies (LCAT) incorporates the music therapy credentials within their licensure.\n\nIn 2006, Hamda Farhat introduced music therapy to Lebanon, developing and inventing therapeutic methods such as the triple method to treat hyperactivity, depression, anxiety, addiction, and post traumatic stress disorder. She has met with great success in working with many international organizations, and in the training of therapists, educators, and doctors.\n\nLive music was used in hospitals after both World Wars as part of the treatment program for recovering soldiers. Clinical music therapy in Britain as it is understood today was pioneered in the 1960s and 1970s by French cellist Juliette Alvin whose influence on the current generation of British music therapy lecturers remains strong. Mary Priestley, one of Juliette Alvin's students, created \"analytical music therapy\". The Nordoff-Robbins approach to music therapy developed from the work of Paul Nordoff and Clive Robbins in the 1950/60s.\n\nPractitioners are registered with the Health Professions Council and, starting from 2007, new registrants must normally hold a master's degree in music therapy. There are master's level programs in music therapy in Manchester, Bristol, Cambridge, South Wales, Edinburgh and London, and there are therapists throughout the UK. The professional body in the UK is the British Association for Music Therapy In 2002, the World Congress of Music Therapy, coordinated and promoted by the World Federation of Music Therapy, was held in Oxford on the theme of Dialogue and Debate. In November 2006, Dr. Michael J. Crawford and his colleagues again found that music therapy helped the outcomes of schizophrenic patients.\n\nThe roots of musical therapy in India, can be traced back to ancient Hindu mythology, Vedic texts, and local folk traditions. It is very possible that music therapy has been used for hundreds of years in the Indian culture.\n\nThe \"Indian Association of Music Therapy\" was established in 2010 by Dr. Dinesh C. Sharma with a motto \"to use pleasant sounds in a specific manner like drug in due course of time as green medicine\" He also publish a journal \"International Journal of Music Therapy (ISSN 2249-8664) to popularize and promote music therapy research on international platform\n\nSuvarna Nalapat has studied music therapy in the Indian context. Her books \"Nadalayasindhu-Ragachikilsamrutam\" (2008), \"Music Therapy in Management Education and Administration\" (2008) and \"Ragachikitsa\" (2008) are accepted textbooks on music therapy and Indian arts. Indian Association of Music Therapy, New Delhi establish in 2010 by Dr. Dinesh C. Sharma with a motto \"to use pleasant sounds as drug in due course of time as green medicine\"\n\nThe \"Music Therapy Trust of India\" is yet another venture in the country. It was started by Margaret Lobo She is the founder and director of the Otakar Kraus Music Trust and her work began in 2004. 7\n\nMusic has been used as a healing implement for centuries. Apollo is the ancient Greek god of music and of medicine. Aesculapius was said to cure diseases of the mind by using song and music, and music therapy was used in Egyptian temples. Plato said that music affected the emotions and could influence the character of an individual. Aristotle taught that music affects the soul and described music as a force that purified the emotions. Aulus Cornelius Celsus advocated the sound of cymbals and running water for the treatment of mental disorders. Music therapy was practiced in the Bible when David played the harp to rid King Saul of a bad spirit (1 Sam 16:23). As early as 400 B.C., Hippocrates played music for mental patients. In the thirteenth century, Arab hospitals contained music-rooms for the benefit of the patients. In the United States, Native American medicine men often employed chants and dances as a method of healing patients. The Turco-Persian psychologist and music theorist al-Farabi (872–950), known as Alpharabius in Europe, dealt with music therapy in his treatise \"Meanings of the Intellect\", in which he discussed the therapeutic effects of music on the soul. In his \"De vita libri tres\" published in 1489, Platonist Marsilio Ficino gives a lengthy account of how music and songs can be used to draw celestial benefits for staying healthy. Robert Burton wrote in the 17th century in his classic work, \"The Anatomy of Melancholy\", that music and dance were critical in treating mental illness, especially melancholia.\n\nThe rise of an understanding of the body and mind in terms of the nervous system led to the emergence of a new wave of music therapy in the eighteenth century. Earlier works on the subject, such as Athanasius Kircher's \"Musurgia universalis\" of 1650 and even early eighteenth-century books such as Michael Ernst Ettmüller's 1714 \"Disputatio effectus musicae in hominem\" (Disputation on the Effect of Music on Man) or Friedrich Erhardt Niedten's 1717 \"Veritophili\", still tended to discuss the medical effects of music in terms of bringing the soul and body into harmony. But from the mid-eighteenth century works on the subject such as Richard Brocklesby's 1749 \"Reflections of Antient and Modern Musick\", the 1737 \"Memoires\" of the French Academy of Sciences, or Ernst Anton Nicolai's 1745 \"Die Verbindung der Musik mit der Arzneygelahrheit\" (The Connection of Music to Medicine), stressed the power of music over the nerves.\n\nAfter 1800 books on music therapy often drew on the Brunonian system of medicine, arguing that the stimulation of the nerves caused by music could directly improve health. For example, Peter Lichtenthal's influential 1807 book \"Der musikalische Arzt\" (The Musical Doctor) was also explicitly Brunonian in its treatment of the effects of music on the body. Lichtenthal, a musician, composer and physician with links to the Mozart family, was mostly positive about music, talking of 'doses of music', which should be determined by someone who knows the \"Brunonian scale\".\n\nMusic therapy as we know it began in the aftermath of World Wars I and II, when, particularly in the United Kingdom, musicians would travel to hospitals and play music for soldiers suffering from war-related emotional and physical trauma.\n\nEven as recent as 2017, music therapy has shown the ability to provide emotional relief to the members of our society. With Logic's \"1-800-273-8255\", suicide prevention calls experienced a 33% growth in relation to their number of calls received in the previous year.\n\nMusic therapy finds its roots in the military. The United States Department of War issued Technical Bulletin 187 in 1945, which described the use of music in the recuperation of military service members in Army hospitals. The use of music therapy in military settings started to flourish and develop following World War II and research and endorsements from both the United States Army and the Surgeon General of the United States. Although these endorsements helped music therapy develop, there was still a recognized need to assess the true viability and value of music as a medically-based therapy. Walter Reed Army Medical Center and the Office of the Surgeon General worked together to lead one of the earliest assessments of a music therapy program. The goal of the study was to understand whether “music presented according to a specific plan” influenced recovery among service members with mental and emotional disorders. Eventually, case reports in reference to this study relayed not only the importance but also the impact of music therapy services in the recovery of military service personnel.\n\nThe first university sponsored music therapy course was taught by Margaret Anderton in 1919 at Columbia University. Anderton's clinical specialty was working with wounded Canadian soldiers during World War II, using music-based services to aid in their recovery process.\n\nToday, Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom have both presented an array of injuries; however, the two signature injuries are Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). These two signature injuries are increasingly common among millennial military service members and in music therapy programs.\n\nMusic therapists work with active duty military personnel, veterans, service members in transition, and their families. Music therapists strive to engage clients in music experiences that foster trust and complete participation over the course of their treatment process. Music therapists use an array of music-centered tools, techniques, and activities when working with military-associated clients, many of which are similar to the techniques used in other music therapy settings. These methods include, but are not limited to: group drumming, listening, singing, and songwriting. Songwriting is a particularly effective tool with military veterans struggling with PTSD and TBI as it creates a safe space to, \"... work through traumatic experiences, and transform traumatic memories into healthier associations\".\n\nMusic therapy in the military is seen in programs on military bases, VA healthcare facilities, military treatment facilities, and military communities. Music therapy programs have a large outreach because they exist for all phases of military life: pre-mobilization, deployment, post-deployment, recovery (in the case of injury), and among families of fallen military service personnel.\n\nResounding Joy, Inc., a San Diego, California-based music therapy program, is a pioneer for the use of music therapy in the military. Its Semper Sound program specializes in providing music therapy services to active duty military service members and veterans diagnosed with PTSD, TBI, substance abuse, and other trauma-related diagnoses. It features different programs such as The Semper Sound Band, based in San Diego, California, and the GI Jams Band, based in Chelsea, Massachusetts.\n\nWalter Reed Army Medical Center located in Bethesda, Maryland, is another pioneer for the use of music therapy in the military. All patients at the medical center are eligible to receive music therapy services; therefore, the range of clients is wide: TBI, stroke, psychological diagnoses (anxiety, depression, PTSD), autism spectrum disorder, and more.\n\nThe Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP) also exists to provide music therapy services to active duty military families who have a family member with a developmental, physical, emotional, or intellectual disorder. Currently, programs at the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Resounding Joy, Inc., and the Music Institute of Chicago partner with EFMP services to provide music therapy services to eligible military family members.\n"}

The recordings preserved in the United States National Recording Registry form a registry of recordings selected yearly by the National Recording Preservation Board for preservation in the Library of Congress.\n\nThe legislative intent of the National Recording Preservation Act of 2000 was to develop a national program to guard America's sound recording heritage. The Act resulted in the formations of the National Recording Registry, The National Recording Preservation Board and a fund-raising foundation to aid their efforts. The act established the Registry specifically for the purpose of maintaining and preserving sound recordings and collections of sound recordings that are culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant. Beginning in 2002, the National Recording Preservation Board began selecting nominated recordings each year to be preserved.\n\nThe first four yearly lists each included 50 selections. However, since 2006, 25 recordings have been selected annually. Thus, a total of 500 recordings have been preserved in the Registry . Each calendar year, public nominations are accepted for inclusion in that year's list of selections to be announced the following spring. Nominations are made in the following categories:\nEach yearly list has often included a few recordings that have also been selected for inclusion in the holdings of the National Archives' audiovisual collection. Those recordings on the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry that are of a political nature will tend to overlap with the audiovisual collection of the National Archives. The list shows overlapping items and whether the National Archives has an original or a copy of the recording.\n\nThe criteria for selection are as follows:\n\nOn January 27, 2003, the following 50 selections were announced by the National Recording Preservation Board.\n\nIn March 2004, the following 50 selections were made by the National Recording Preservation Board.\n\nIn April 2005, the following 50 selections were made by the National Recording Preservation Board.\n\nIn April 2006, the following 50 selections were made by the National Recording Preservation Board.\n\nOn March 6, 2007, the following 25 selections were made by the National Recording Preservation Board.\n\n \n\nOn May 14, 2008, the following 25 selections were made by the National Recording Preservation Board.\n\nOn June 10, 2009, the following 25 selections were made by the National Recording Preservation Board.\nOn June 23, 2010, the following 25 selections were made by the National Recording Preservation Board.\n\nOn April 6, 2011, the following 25 selections were announced.\nOn May 23, 2012, the following 25 selections were made by the National Recording Preservation Board.\n\nOn March 21, 2013, the following 25 selections were announced.\n\nOn April 2, 2014, the following 25 selections were announced.\nOn March 25, 2015, the following 25 selections were announced.\n\nOn March 23, 2016, the following 25 selections were announced.\n\nOn March 29, 2017, the following 25 selections were announced.\n\nOn March 21, 2018, the following 25 selections were announced.\n\n, the oldest recording on the list is Edouard-Leon Scott de Martinville's Phonautograms which date back to 1853. The most recent is \"Fanfare for the Uncommon Woman\" by Joan Tower, performed by the Colorado Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Marin Alsop, which was released in 1999.\n\nSelections vary widely in duration. Both the early Edison recordings and the instrumental \"Rumble\" by Link Wray, as well as \"Rock Around the Clock\" by Bill Haley and His Comets clock in at under three minutes; the Edison Talking Doll cylinder is only 17 seconds long and some of Scott de Martinville's Photoautograms are just as brief. Meanwhile, Georg Solti's recording of Wagner's complete \"Ring Cycle\" is approximately 15 hours in duration and Alexander Scourby's recitation of the King James Bible is over 80 hours in length.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3429305", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3429305", "title": "Niche real estate", "text": "Niche real estate\n\nA niche is a specialized sector of the property market. Examples include income property, garden real estate, condos, equestrian property, vacation property, farm property, golf property, golf course redevelopment, waterfront homes, beach houses and luxury homes. These are often categories in which potential buyers think about the property they seek. They are also used by real estate marketing companies to reach these types of buyers. In this context a niche describes a specific segment of home buyers and sellers, classified by ethnicity, nationality or socio-economic group (e.g. social housing or luxury real estate).\n\nIncome properties are bought for the purpose of making an income or profit through renting or leasing. These properties can be commercial or residential. Residential properties are also known as \"non-owner occupied\" and these types are considered to involve a higher risk, and a mortgage for it may carry a higher interest rate than a mortgage for ’’owner-occupied’’ income property.\n\nGarden real estates include a significant garden design that contributes to the overall value of the property. These properties originate in three different ways: gardens that are designed by prominent landscapers, gardens that were designed by architects or professional landscapers, and gardens that were designed by the previous owner. \nGolf properties include residential properties and communities surrounding golf courses. The value of these properties may increase through being near well established golf courses. \nCondominiums are individually-owned single housing units in a multi-unit building. The owner of a unit pays property taxes on his unit and may rent, mortgage, or sell the unit just like any other type of personal property. Condominiums can be residential or commercial, such as office condominiums.\nEquestrian properties, also called \"horse communities,\" are facilitated communities where nearby facilities and trails cater to the needs of all types of horses and horse owners. Stables and open areas may be either shared or private with a resident staff. Hangars, fueling stations, and maintenance facilities may also be incorporated into the equestrian community.\nFarm property is an area of land that includes arable land used for growing crops together with home and surrounding facilities used for keeping animals and maintenance.\n\nVacation properties can be separated into smaller segments of the market defined by season of occupancy, locale and associated activity. Vacation property can be owned or rented by vacationers through agencies, and it usually includes beachfront condominiums, lakeside fishing retreats, mountain cottages, etc.\n\nWaterfront homes sit near a body of water such as a river, lake, ocean or canal. Water frontage is likely to boost the value of homes and make them worth more than double of the value of homes overall.\n\nBeach house is a property located on a beach or within a mile from a beach. It can be used for either residential or vacation purposes. \nLuxury homes are unique and exclusive properties. There is no exact size, style, and design that embodies a luxury home, but homes with a storied history, extraordinary views, remarkable architecture, or beautiful interior and exterior design can also be included in the category of luxury homes.\n"}

The device has USB and SD ports, can play DVDs and EVDs (enhanced versatile discs, which are physically identical to DVDs but use a different file format), and contains a radio and TV tuner.\n\nNotels have been popular in North Korea since around 2005, significantly facilitating the extension of the \"Korean Wave\" (\"Hallyu\", the increase of the popularity of South Korean pop culture internationally) into the isolated country. After an earlier crackdown that caused their black market prices to drop, the devices were legalized in December 2014. As of 2015, they are available in some government stores (possession must be registered) as well as selling on the black market for around 300 Chinese yuan (ca. US$50), and are present in up to one in two urban households, according to some estimations. In China, Notels are no longer popular as of 2015, but sell well in the provinces that border on North Korea.\n\nAccording to defectors, the Notel's multi-format support is used for evading detection of illegal media consumption: A North Korean DVD is placed in the device while a South Korean video is played from a USB drive or the SD card, which can be quickly removed in case government inspectors arrive and check the device's temperature to see if it has been recently used, leaving the DVD as an alternative explanation.\n\n"}

One \"pahar\" nominally equals three hours, and there are eight \"pahars\" in a day. In India, the measure is primarily used in North India and Urdu speaking communities throughout the Deccan in Southern India.\n\n\"Pahar\"/\"pehar\"/\"peher\" is derived from Sanskrit word prahar which is an ancient unit of time in India.\n\nThe word \"pahar\"/\"peher\" has the same root as the Hindustani word \"pehra\" (meaning \"to stand guard\") and \"pehredar\" (literally \"guard\"/watchman). It literally means a \"watch\" (i.e. period of guard-duty).\n\nTraditionally, night and day were each allocated four \"pahars\", or \"watches.\" The first \"pahar\" of the day (or \"din pahar\") was timed to begin at sunrise, and the first \"pahar\" of the night (\"raat pahar\") was timed to begin at sunset.\n\nThis meant that in the winter the daytime \"pahars\" were shorter than the nighttime \"pahars,\" and the opposite was true in summer. The \"pahar\"s were exactly equal on the equinoxes. Thus, the length of the traditional \"pahar\" varied from about 2.5 hours to 3.5 hours in the Indo-Gangetic plains.\n\nEach \"pahar\" of a 24-hour day-night cycle has a specific name and number. The first \"pahar\" of the day, known as \"pehla pahar\" (Hindustani: \"pehla\", meaning \"first\"), corresponds to the early morning. The second \"pahar\" is called \"do-pahar\" (Hindustani: \"do\", meaning \"second\"). In the common speech of North India, Pakistan and Nepal, \"dopahar\" (दोपहर or دوپہر) has come to be the generic term for \"afternoon\" or \"midday\". The third \"pahar\" is called \"seh pahar\" (Persian:\"seh\", meaning \"three\") and has generically come to mean evening, though the term is less commonly used than \"shaam\".\n\nThe poet-saint Kabir mentions \"pahar\" in one of his dohas:\n\nपाँच पहर धंधे गया, तीन पहर गया सोय ।\n\nएक पहर हरि नाम बिन, मुक्ति कैसे होय ॥\n\n[You] went to work for five \"pahar\"s, slept for the remaining three \"pahar\"s.

{"id": "49972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49972", "title": "Rosicrucianism", "text": "Rosicrucianism\n\nRosicrucianism is a spiritual and cultural movement which arose in Europe in the early 17th century after the publication of several texts which purported to announce the existence of a hitherto unknown esoteric order to the world and made seeking its knowledge attractive to many. The mysterious doctrine of the order is allegedly \"built on esoteric truths of the ancient past\", which \"concealed from the average man, provide insight into nature, the physical universe, and the spiritual realm.\" The manifestos do not elaborate extensively on the matter, but clearly combine references to Kabbalah, Hermeticism, alchemy, and mystical Christianity.\n\nThe Rosicrucian manifestos heralded a \"universal reformation of mankind\", through a science allegedly kept secret for decades until the intellectual climate might receive it. Controversies have arisen on whether they were a hoax, whether the \"Order of the Rosy Cross\" existed as described in the manifestos, or whether the whole thing was a metaphor disguising a movement that really existed, but in a different form. In 1616, Johann Valentin Andreae famously designated it as a \"ludibrium\". Some esoteric scholars suggest that this statement was later made by Andreae in order to shield himself from the wrath of the religious and political institutions of the day, which were intolerant of free speech and the idea of a \"universal reformation\", which the manifestos called for. \n\nAn example of the rosicrucian, rosy cross symbol predating the early rosicrucian manifestoes is that shown on the central panel of Herbaville Triptych, which is Byzantine and comes from the 10th or 11th century. The symbol is a Calvary cross with a rose in its centre, which is identical with what masonic/rosicrucian scholar, Manly Palmer Hall, claimed to be the original symbol of the rosicrucians.\nIn his work \"Silentium Post Clamores\" (1617), rosicrucian, Michel Maier (1568–1622), described rosicrucianism as having arisen from a \"Primordial Tradition\" in the following statement: \"Our origins are Egyptian, Brahmanic, derived from the mysteries of Eleusis and Samothrace, the Magi of Persia, the Pythagoreans, and the Arabs.\"\n\nBy promising a spiritual transformation at a time of great turmoil, the manifestos influenced many figures to seek esoteric knowledge. Seventeenth-century occult philosophers such as Michael Maier, Robert Fludd, and Thomas Vaughan interested themselves in the Rosicrucian world view. According to historian David Stevenson, it was influential to Freemasonry as it was emerging in Scotland.\n\nIn later centuries, many esoteric societies have claimed to derive from the original Rosicrucians. Rosicrucianism is symbolized by the Rosy Cross or Rose Cross. \nThe largest and most influential of these societies has been the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, which consisted of several well known members of society. The other is the Rosicrucian Order, A.M.O.R.C, an international, initiatic Fraternity, which involves itself in several educational and cultural activities, worldwide.\n\nBetween 1614 and 1617, three anonymous manifestos were published, first in Germany and later throughout Europe. These were the \"Fama Fraternitatis RC\" (\"The Fame of the Brotherhood of RC\", 1614), the \"Confessio Fraternitatis\" (\"The Confession of the Brotherhood of RC\", 1615), and the \"Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosicross a.D. MCCCCLIX\" (1617).\n\nThe \"Fama Fraternitatis\" presents the legend of a German doctor and mystic philosopher referred to as \"Father Brother C.R.C.\" (later identified in a third manifesto as Christian Rosenkreuz, or \"Rose-cross\"). The year 1378 is presented as being the birth year of \"our Christian Father\", and it is stated that he lived 106 years. After studying in the Middle East under various masters, possibly adhering to Sufism, he was unable to spread the knowledge he had acquired to prominent European scientists and philosophers. Instead, he gathered a small circle of friends/disciples and founded the Rosicrucian Order (this can be deduced to have occurred around 1407).\n\nDuring Rosenkreuz's lifetime, the order was said to comprise no more than eight members, each a doctor and a sworn bachelor. Each member undertook an oath to heal the sick, but without payment, to maintain a secret fellowship, and to find a replacement for himself before he died. Three such generations had supposedly passed between c. 1500 and c. 1600, a time when scientific, philosophical and religious freedom had grown so that the public might benefit from the Rosicrucians' knowledge, so that they were now seeking good men.\n\nThe manifestos were and are not taken literally by many but rather regarded either as hoaxes or as allegorical statements. The manifestos directly state: \"We speak unto you by parables, but would willingly bring you to the right, simple, easy, and ingenuous exposition, understanding, declaration, and knowledge of all secrets.\"\n\nIt is evident that the first Rosicrucian manifesto was influenced by the work of the respected hermetic philosopher Heinrich Khunrath, of Hamburg, author of the \"Amphitheatrum Sapientiae Aeternae\" (1609), who was in turn influenced by John Dee, author of the \"Monas Hieroglyphica\" (1564). The invitation to the royal wedding in the \"Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz\" opens with Dee's philosophical key, the \"Monas Hieroglyphica\" symbol. The writer also claimed the brotherhood possessed a book that resembled the works of Paracelsus. Adam Haslmayr a close friend of Karl Widemann (who collected Paracelsus' work), wrote him a letter about Rosicrucian people who revealed the Theophrastiam, on December 24, 1611.\n\nTheir literature announced them as moral and religious reformers. They used the techniques of chemistry (alchemy) and of the sciences generally as media through which to publicize their opinions and beliefs.\n\nIn his autobiography, Johann Valentin Andreae (1586–1654) claimed that the anonymously published \"Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz\" was one of his works, and he subsequently described it as a \"ludibrium\". In his later works, he makes alchemy an object of ridicule and places it along with music, art, theater and astrology in the category of less serious sciences. According to some sources, his role in the origin of the Rosicrucian legend is controversial. However, it was generally accepted according to others.\n\nIn the early 17th century, the manifestos caused excitement throughout Europe by declaring the existence of a secret brotherhood of alchemists and sages who were preparing to transform the arts, sciences, religion, and political and intellectual landscape of Europe. Wars of politics and religion ravaged the continent. The works were re-issued several times, followed by numerous pamphlets, favorable or otherwise. Between 1614 and 1620, about 400 manuscripts and books were published which discussed the Rosicrucian documents.\n\nThe peak of the \"Rosicrucianism furore\" was reached when two mysterious posters appeared on the walls of Paris in 1622 within a few days of each other. The first said \"We, the Deputies of the Higher College of the Rose-Croix, do make our stay, visibly and invisibly, in this city (...)\", and the second ended with the words \"The thoughts attached to the real desire of the seeker will lead us to him and him to us.\"\n\nThe legendary first manifesto, \"Fama Fraternitatis Rosae Crucis\" (1614), inspired the works of Michael Maier (1568–1622) of Germany; Robert Fludd (1574–1637) and Elias Ashmole (1617–1692) of England; Teophilus Schweighardt Constantiens, Gotthardus Arthusius, Julius Sperber, Henricus Madathanus, Gabriel Naudé, Thomas Vaughan and others.\n\nIn Elias Ashmole's \"Theatrum Chimicum britannicum\" (1650) he defends the Rosicrucians. Some later works impacting Rosicrucianism were the \"Opus magocabalisticum et theosophicum\" by George von Welling (1719)—of alchemical and paracelsian inspiration—and the \"Aureum Vellus oder Goldenes Vliess\" by Hermann Fictuld in 1749.\n\nMichael Maier was appointed \"Pfalzgraf\" (Count Palatine) by Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Hungary and King of Bohemia. He also was one of the most prominent defenders of the Rosicrucians, clearly transmitting details about the \"Brothers of the Rose Cross\" in his writings. Maier made the firm statement that the Brothers of R.C. exist to advance inspired arts and sciences, including alchemy. Researchers of Maier's writings point out that he never claimed to have produced gold, nor did Heinrich Khunrath or any of the other \"Rosicrucianists\". Their writings point toward a symbolic and spiritual alchemy, rather than an operative one. In a combination of direct and veiled styles, these writings conveyed the nine stages of the involutive-evolutive transmutation of the \"threefold body\" of the human being, the \"threefold soul\" and the \"threefold spirit\", among other esoteric knowledge related to the \"Path of Initiation\".\n\nIn his 1618 pamphlet, \"Pia et Utilissima Admonitio de Fratribus Rosae Crucis\", Henrichus Neuhusius wrote that the Rosicrucians departed for the east due to European instability caused by the start of the Thirty Years' War. In 1710, Sigmund Richter, founder of the secret society of the Golden and Rosy Cross, also suggested the Rosicrucians had migrated eastward. In the first half of the 20th century, René Guénon, a researcher of the occult, presented this same idea in some of his works. An eminent author of the 19th century, Arthur Edward Waite, presented arguments contradicting this idea. It was in this fertile field of discourse that many Rosicrucian societies arose. They were based on the occult, inspired by the mystery of this \"College of Invisibles\".\n\nSome modern scholars, for example Adam McLean and Giordano Berti, assume that among the first followers of the Rose Cross there was also the German theologian Daniel Cramer, who in 1617 published a bizarre treatise entitled \"Societas Jesus et Rosae Crucis Vera\" (The True Society of Jesus and the Rosy Cross), containing 40 emblematic figures accompanied by biblical quotations.\nThe literary works of the 16th and 17th centuries were full of enigmatic passages containing references to the Rose Cross, as in the following (somewhat modernized):\n\nThe idea of such an order, exemplified by the network of astronomers, professors, mathematicians, and natural philosophers in 16th-century Europe promoted by such men as Johannes Kepler, Georg Joachim Rheticus, John Dee and Tycho Brahe, gave rise to the Invisible College. This was the precursor to the Royal Society founded in 1660. It was constituted by a group of scientists who began to hold regular meetings to share and develop knowledge acquired by experimental investigation. Among these were Robert Boyle, who wrote: \"the cornerstones of the Invisible (or as they term themselves the Philosophical) College, do now and then honour me with their company...\"; John Wilkins and John Wallis, who described those meetings in the following terms: \"About the year 1645, while I lived in London (at a time when, by our civil wars, academical studies were much interrupted in both our Universities), ... I had the opportunity of being acquainted with divers worthy persons, inquisitive natural philosophy, and other parts of human learning; and particularly of what hath been called the New Philosophy or Experimental Philosophy. We did by agreements, divers of us, meet weekly in London on a certain day and hour, under a certain penalty, and a weekly contribution for the charge of experiments, with certain rules agreed amongst us, to treat and discourse of such affairs...\"\n\nAccording to Jean Pierre Bayard, two Rosicrucian-inspired Masonic rites emerged toward the end of 18th century, the Rectified Scottish Rite, widespread in Central Europe where there was a strong presence of the \"Golden and Rosy Cross\", and the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, first practised in France, in which the 18th degree is called \"Knight of the Rose Croix\".\n\nThe change from \"operative\" to \"speculative\" Masonry occurred between the end of the 16th and the beginning of the 18th century. Two of the earliest speculative Masons for whom a record of initiation exists were Sir Robert Moray and Elias Ashmole. Robert Vanloo states that earlier 17th century Rosicrucianism had a considerable influence on Anglo-Saxon Masonry. Hans Schick sees in the works of Comenius (1592–1670) the ideal of the newly born English Masonry before the foundation of the Grand Lodge in 1717. Comenius was in England during 1641.\n\nThe Gold und Rosenkreuzer (Golden and Rosy Cross) was founded by the alchemist Samuel Richter who in 1710 published \"Die warhhaffte und vollkommene Bereitung des Philosophischen Steins der Brüderschaft aus dem Orden des Gülden-und Rosen-Creutzes\" (\"The True and Complete Preparation of the Philosopher's Stone by the Brotherhood from the Order of the Golden and Rosy Cross\") in Breslau under the pseudonym Sincerus Renatus in Prague in the early 18th century as a hierarchical secret society composed of internal circles, recognition signs and alchemy treatises. Under the leadership of Hermann Fictuld the group reformed itself extensively in 1767 and again in 1777 because of political pressure. Its members claimed that the leaders of the Rosicrucian Order had invented Freemasonry and only they knew the secret meaning of Masonic symbols. The Rosicrucian Order had been founded by Egyptian \"Ormusse\" or \"Licht-Weise\" who had emigrated to Scotland with the name \"Builders from the East\". In 1785 and 1788 the Golden and Rosy Cross group published the \"Geheime Figuren\" or \"The Secret Symbols of the 16th and 17th century Rosicrucians\".\n\nLed by Johann Christoph von Wöllner and General Johann Rudolf von Bischoffwerder, the Masonic lodge (later: \"Grand Lodge\") \"Zu den drei Weltkugeln\" (\"The Three Globes\") was infiltrated and came under the influence of the Golden and Rosy Cross. Many Freemasons became Rosicrucianists and Rosicrucianism was established in many lodges. In 1782 at the Convent of Wilhelmsbad the \"Alte schottische Loge Friedrich zum goldenen Löwen\" (\"Old Scottish Lodge Friedrich at the Golden Lion\") in Berlin strongly requested Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and all other Freemasons to submit to the Golden and Rosy Cross, without success.\n\nAfter 1782, this highly secretive society added Egyptian, Greek, and Druidic mysteries to its alchemy system. A comparative study of what is known about the Gold and Rosenkreuzer appears to reveal, on the one hand, that it has influenced the creation of some modern initiatic groups and, on the other hand, that the Nazis (see \"The Occult Roots of Nazism\") may have been inspired by this German group.\n\nAccording to the writings of the Masonic historian E.J. Marconis de Negre, who together with his father Gabriel M. Marconis is held to be the founder of the \"Rite of Memphis-Misraim\" of Freemasonry, based on earlier conjectures (1784) by a Rosicrucian scholar Baron de Westerode and also promulgated by the 18th century secret society called the \"Golden and Rosy Cross\", the Rosicrucian Order was created in the year 46 when an Alexandrian Gnostic sage named Ormus and his six followers were converted by one of Jesus' disciples, Mark. Their symbol was said to be a red cross surmounted by a rose, thus the designation of Rosy Cross. From this conversion, Rosicrucianism was supposedly born, by purifying Egyptian mysteries with the new higher teachings of early Christianity.\n\nAccording to Maurice Magre (1877–1941) in his book \"Magicians, Seers, and Mystics\", Rosenkreutz was the last descendant of the Germelshausen, a German family from the 13th century. Their castle stood in the Thuringian Forest on the border of Hesse, and they embraced Albigensian doctrines. The whole family was put to death by Landgrave Conrad of Thuringia, except for the youngest son, who was then five years old. He was carried away secretly by a monk, an Albigensian adept from Languedoc, and placed in a monastery under the influence of the Albigenses, where he was educated and met the four Brothers later to be associated with him in the founding of the Rosicrucian Brotherhood. Magre's account supposedly derives from oral tradition.\n\nAround 1530, more than eighty years before the publication of the first manifesto, the association of cross and rose already existed in Portugal in the Convent of the Order of Christ, home of the Knights Templar, later renamed Order of Christ. Three \"bocetes\" were, and still are, on the \"abóboda\" (vault) of the initiation room. The rose can clearly be seen at the center of the cross. At the same time, a minor writing by Paracelsus called \"Prognosticatio Eximii Doctoris Paracelsi\" (1530), containing 32 prophecies with allegorical pictures surrounded by enigmatic texts, makes reference to an image of a double cross over an open rose; this is one of the examples used to prove the \"Fraternity of the Rose Cross\" existed far earlier than 1614.\n\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th centuries, various groups styled themselves Rosicrucian. The diverse groups who link themselves to a \"Rosicrucian Tradition\" can be divided into three categories: Esoteric Christian Rosicrucian groups, which profess Christ; Masonic Rosicrucian groups such as Societas Rosicruciana; and initiatory groups such as the Golden Dawn and the Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis (AMORC).\n\nEsoteric Christian Rosicrucian schools provide esoteric knowledge related to the inner teachings of Christianity.\n\n\nAccording to Masonic writers, the Order of the Rose Cross is expounded in a major Christian literary work that molded the subsequent spiritual beliefs of western civilization: \"The Divine Comedy\" (ca. 1308–1321) by Dante Alighieri.\n\nOther Christian-Rosicrucian oriented bodies include:\n\n\nFreemasonic Rosicrucian bodies providing preparation either through direct study and/or through the practice of symbolic-initiatic journey.\n\nInitiatory groups which follow a degree system of study and initiation include:\n\nMany of these groups generally speak of a lineal descent from earlier branches of the ancient Rosicrucian Order in England, France, Egypt, or other countries. However, some groups speak of a spiritual affiliation with a true and invisible Rosicrucian Order. Note that there are other Rosicrucian groups not listed here. Some do not use the name \"Rosicrucian\" to name themselves. Some groups listed may have been dissolved and are no longer operating.\n\nOld editions\nPublications\nEssays\nFictional literature\nConspiracy literature\n\n"}

In such cultures, girls' puberty held more significance than boys' due to menstruation, the girl's potential for giving birth, and widespread ideas of ritual purification related to the sacred power of blood. These societies practised various rites of passage, many of which lost their original forms or completely disappeared with the emergence of modern trends such as industrialization.\n\nTwo rules were common in the seclusion of adolescent girls: the girl must neither touch the ground nor see the sun. According to Sir James George Frazer, these rules also applied to divine kings and priests. These divine kings were carried on shoulders by their underlings who walked upon tapestry or carpet. Scholars have speculated that the Paleolithic Venus figurines are related to such puberty rites as they lack facial features (not seeing the sun), their tapered legs without feet (not touching the ground), and their adiposity (caused by seclusion).\n\nAmong puberty rites which Frazer described, many adhered to the above rules:\nFrazer believed that the Greek myth of Danaë, who was kept by her father in seclusion but was impregnated by Zeus, was related to girls' puberty rites. Lincoln also finds parallels between the Greek myth about the abduction of Persephone and the seclusion of girls at puberty. According to him, the seclusion of Tukuna girls at puberty may be referred to as \"being in the underworld\".\n\nSuch seclusion rites are linked to the social preparation of girls for womanhood and their roles as wives and mothers. During their seclusion, girls would be taught by older women about their future roles.\n\nFrazer claims the reason for seclusion practises was the \"deeply engrained dread\" of \"menstruous blood\". The first appearance of menstrual blood caused more fear than subsequent menstrual cycles. These fears stemmed more from superstition related to the sacred power of blood than from hygienic issues or the possible spread of disease.\n\nAmong the Apache Indians, \"the adolescent girls are not segregated as sources of danger, but court is paid to them as to direct sources of supernatural blessing\". A girl at her first menstruation was considered to be possessed of \"a degree of supernatural power\" which, though not entirely malevolent, still aroused feelings of the \"power of evil\".\n\nThe Bushmen of South Africa believed that making eye contact with a girl during this period would make men \"fixed in whatever position they happen to occupy\".\n\nIn earlier societies, some pubescent girls might have shown some unusual behaviours, giving rise to superstitions. Such behaviours could have been triggered by a number of factors; for example, pubescent girls are more prone to depressive episodes than boys of a similar age. Historical records also show that these girls may have been subjects of incestuous relationships and abuse, triggering abnormal behaviours.\n\n\n"}

The practice, dating back many centuries, led to the symbol eventually becoming associated with the concept of death. Some crucifixes feature a skull and crossbones beneath the corpus (the depiction of Jesus' body), in reference to a legend that the place of the crucifixion was also the burial place of Adam or, more likely, in reference to the New Testament statement (King James Version: Matthew 27:33, Mark 15:22, and John 19:17) that the place of his crucifixion was called \"Golgotha\" (tr. \"the Place of a Skull\").\n\nToday, an example of a real skull and crossbones may be seen in the 1732 Nuestra Señora del Pilar church overlooking the famous Recoleta Cemetery in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It contains several altars rescued from other early Spanish churches in South America. One of these has twenty rectangular window boxes arrayed behind and above the altar, five wide by four tall. The size of these glass window boxes is such that the femurs of the priests thus interred are a bit too long to lie flat and so must be leaned up in an \"X\" formation. The other bones fill in the spaces around the femurs with the skull sitting prominently on top of the bone pile centered above the \"X\".\n\nThe Jolly Roger, and the similar Totenkopf was a popular symbol of mortality across at this time across Europe and has its origins in the mediaeval Danse Macabre.\n\nTombstones from the 18th century in Southern Scotland fairly frequently feature skull and crossbones.\n\nThe Church of St Nicholas in Deptford features two Deaths Heads on its gateposts dating to the early 18th century.\n"}

{"id": "155747", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=155747", "title": "Travel", "text": "Travel\n\nTravel is the movement of people between distant geographical locations. Travel can be done by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, bus, airplane, or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip. Travel can also include relatively short stays between successive movements.\n\nThe origin of the word \"travel\" is most likely lost to history. The term \"travel\" may originate from the Old French word \"travail\", which means 'work'. According to the Merriam Webster dictionary, the first known use of the word \"travel\" was in the 14th century. It also states that the word comes from Middle English \"travailen\", \"travelen\" (which means to torment, labor, strive, journey) and earlier from Old French \"travailler\" (which means to work strenuously, toil). In English we still occasionally use the words \"travail\", which means struggle. According to Simon Winchester in his book \"The Best Travelers' Tales (2004)\", the words \"travel\" and \"travail\" both share an even more ancient root: a Roman instrument of torture called the \"tripalium\" (in Latin it means \"three stakes\", as in to impale). This link may reflect the extreme difficulty of travel in ancient times. Today, travel may or may not be much easier depending upon the destination you choose (e.g. Mt. Everest, the Amazon rainforest), how you plan to get there (tour bus, cruise ship, or oxcart), and whether you decide to \"rough it\" (see extreme tourism and adventure travel). \"There's a big difference between simply being a tourist and being a true world traveler\", notes travel writer Michael Kasum. This is, however, a contested distinction as academic work on the cultures and sociology of travel has noted.\n\nReasons for traveling include recreation, tourism or vacationing, research travel, the gathering of information, visiting people, volunteer travel for charity, migration to begin life somewhere else, religious pilgrimages and mission trips, business travel, trade, commuting, and other reasons, such as to obtain health care or waging or fleeing war or for the enjoyment of traveling. Travellers may use human-powered transport such as walking or bicycling; or vehicles, such as public transport, automobiles, trains and airplanes.\n\nMotives for travel include:\n\n\nTravel dates back to antiquity where wealthy Greeks and Romans would travel for leisure to their summer homes and villas in cities such as Pompeii and Baiae.\nWhile early travel tended to be slower, more dangerous, and more dominated by trade and migration, cultural and technological advances over many years have tended to mean that travel has become easier and more accessible. Mankind has come a long way in transportation since Christopher Columbus sailed to the new world from Spain in 1492, an expedition which took over 10 weeks to arrive at the final destination; to the 21st century where aircraft allow travel from Spain to the United States overnight.\n\nTravel in the Middle Ages offered hardships and challenges, however, it was important to the economy and to society. The wholesale sector depended (for example) on merchants dealing with/through caravans or sea-voyagers, end-user retailing often demanded the services of many itinerant peddlers wandering from village to hamlet, gyrovagues (Wandering Monks) and wandering friars brought theology and pastoral support to neglected areas, travelling minstrels practiced the never-ending tour, and armies ranged far and wide in various crusades and in sundry other wars.\nPilgrimages were common in both the European and Islamic world and involved streams of travellers both locally (Canterbury Tales-style) and internationally.\n\nIn the late 16th century it became fashionable for young European aristocrats and wealthy upper class men to travel to significant European cities as part of their education in the arts and literature. This was known as the Grand Tour, it included cities such as London, Paris, Venice, Florence and Rome.\nHowever, The French revolution brought with it the end of the Grand Tour.\n\nTravel by water often provided more comfort and speed than land-travel, at least until the advent of a network of railways in the 19th century. Travel for the purpose of tourism is reported to have started around this time when people began to travel for fun as travel was no longer a hard and challenging task. This was capitalised on by people like Thomas Cook selling tourism packages where trains and hotels were booked together. Airships and airplanes took over much of the role of long-distance surface travel in the 20th century, notably after the second World War where there was a surplus of both aircraft and pilots.\n\nTravel may be local, regional, national (domestic) or international. In some countries, non-local internal travel may require an internal passport, while international travel typically requires a passport and visa. A trip may also be part of a round-trip, which is a particular type of travel whereby a person moves from one location to another and returns.\n\nAuthorities emphasize the importance of taking precautions to ensure travel safety. When traveling abroad, the odds favor a safe and incident-free trip, however, travelers can be subject to difficulties, crime and violence. Some safety considerations include being aware of one's surroundings, avoiding being the target of a crime, leaving copies of one's passport and itinerary information with trusted people, obtaining medical insurance valid in the country being visited and registering with one's national embassy when arriving in a foreign country. Many countries do not recognize drivers' licenses from other countries; however most countries accept international driving permits. Automobile insurance policies issued in one's own country are often invalid in foreign countries, and it is often a requirement to obtain temporary auto insurance valid in the country being visited. It is also advisable to become oriented with the driving-rules and -regulations of destination countries. Wearing a seat belt is highly advisable for safety reasons; many countries have penalties for violating seatbelt laws.\n\nThere are three main statistics which may be used to compare the safety of various forms of travel (based on a DETR survey in October 2000):\n\n"}

It is also known as wire decking or ventilated shelving.\n\nWire decking consists of wire mesh supported by metal supports and is intended to be load-bearing. The mesh is usually welded to the supports, but may be attached in other ways as well. In commercial and industrial applications, the wire mesh usually has a minimum wire gauge of 0.105 inches when round wire is used. The most common shelf size is 42 inches deep by 46 inches wide, while two such shelves placed side-by-side can usually be combined to allow for a single shelf of 8 feet wide. The weight capacity of a 42x46 shelf ranges from 2,000 to 3,500 pounds, while the decking itself weighs from 24 to 30 pounds. The finish on the steel may either be painted or sprayed on, or be electroplated with zinc. Electroplating is more common with Chinese manufacturers while painting or spraying is more common with American manufacturers.\n\nWire shelving is used in a broad range of commercial and home applications. It is often used in restaurant, food service and retail store applications due to its ability to stay clean and resist rust and mold. It is also used by retailers, in industrial applications and in home kitchens as well. Wire shelving is excellent in areas where fire prevention is stressed because its open design allows sprinkler systems to function where solid shelving might block water flow.\n\nChrome-plated steel is much cheaper and much less rust resistant to scratches. Typical colors are chrome, white and black.\n\nWire shelving for industrial use consists of steel wire, used for the decking, and steel sheets, used for the supports. The wire makes up about 60% of the weight and the sheet steel about 40%.\n\nCoiled steel wire is cut to the correct lengths required using straight-cut machines. Then, these individual wires are fed through a welding machine that joins them, using electric-resistance welding at each junction. The creates a continuous wire mesh, which is then cut to the lengths required.\n\nManufacturers receive sheets of steel pre-cut for the widths required. The sheets are fed through a roll-forming machine to create a \"U\" or \"V\" shape. The roll-forming machine also cuts the supports to the length required.\n\nAfter welding, the decking is coated with either baked-on enamel or baked-on powder coating. This requires a cleaning process, heat drying, cooling, paint dip, and then final curing. The decking can instead be electroplated with zinc.\n\nMost manufacturers use the same equipment to produce other products. These include concrete reinforcement, mining, containers and other items made from steel mesh\n\nIn 2008, eleven firms in the United States produced comprised 99% of that country's industry. Most US manufacturers sell wire decking nationwide. Manufacturers usually sell to distributors rather than directly to customers, with big-box retail being a large buyer. Walmart was the number one purchaser for several years during the 2000s. Both US and Chinese firms had high levels of excess capacity around 2010, allowing them to quickly respond to potential increases in demand. Manufacturers reported that the product had changed very little in the previous decade.\n\nThere is no predictable business cycle in the wire decking industry. Demand closely tracks industrial output and real estate construction, but with a 6 to 9-month delay. As a result, the wire decking industry didn't feel the effects of the Great Recession until well into 2009.\n\nThe industry has developed a quality certification called \"R-Mark.\"\n\nIn the 2000s, US producers accused China of subsidizing wire decking and unfair trade practices. A US Trade Commission investigation rejected these allegations.\n\nHowever, not all pole diameters and shelf widths in use are the same. The various plastic connectors are not interchangeable among manufacturers. Many use proprietary designs that do not fit with the systems of other makers. This variance tends to make it difficult to mix and match various brands of shelving.\n"}
