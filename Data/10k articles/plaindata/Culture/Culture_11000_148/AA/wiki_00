The foundation of the Empire in 27 BC would be AUC 727.\n\nUsage of the term was more common during the Renaissance, when editors sometimes added AUC to Roman manuscripts they published, giving the false impression that the convention was commonly used in antiquity. In reality, the dominant method of identifying years in Roman times was to name the two consuls who held office that year. In late antiquity, regnal years were also in use, as was the Diocletian era in Roman Egypt after AD 293, and in the Byzantine Empire after AD 537, following a decree by Justinian.\n\nThe traditional date for the founding of Rome, 21 April 753 BC, is due to Marcus Terentius Varro (First Century BC). Varro may have used the consular list (with its mistakes) and called the year of the first consuls \"\"ab urbe condita\" 245,\" accepting the 244-year interval from Dionysius of Halicarnassus for the kings after the foundation of Rome. The correctness of this calculation has not been confirmed, but it is still used worldwide.\n\nFrom the time of Claudius (ruled AD 41 to AD 54) onward, this calculation superseded other contemporary calculations. Celebrating the anniversary of the city became part of imperial propaganda. Claudius was the first to hold magnificent celebrations in honor of the anniversary of the city, in AD 48, the eight hundredth year from the founding of the city. Hadrian and Antoninus Pius held similar celebrations, in AD 121, and in AD 147 and AD 148, respectively.\n\nIn AD 248, Philip the Arab celebrated Rome's first millennium, together with Ludi saeculares for Rome's alleged tenth sæculum. Coins from his reign commemorate the celebrations. A coin by a contender for the imperial throne, Pacatianus, explicitly states \"[y]ear one thousand and first\", which is an indication that the citizens of the empire had a sense of the beginning of a new era, a \"Sæculum Novum\".\n\nThe Anno Domini (AD) year numbering was developed by a monk named Dionysius Exiguus in Rome in AD 525, as a result of his work on calculating the date of Easter. \nDionysius did not use the AUC convention, but instead based his calculations on the \nDiocletian era.\nThis convention had been in use since AD 293, the year of the tetrarchy, as it became impractical to use regnal years of the current emperor.\nIn his Easter table, the year AD 532 was equated with the 248th regnal year of Diocletian. The table counted the years starting from the presumed birth of Christ, rather than the accession of the emperor Diocletian on 20 November AD 284, or as stated by Dionysius: \"sed magis elegimus ab incarnatione Domini nostri Jesu Christi annorum tempora praenotare…\" (\"but rather we choose to name the times of the years from the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ …\"). Blackburn and Holford-Strevens review interpretations of Dionysius which place the Incarnation in 2 BC, 1 BC, or AD 1. \n\nIt has later been calculated (from the historical record of the succession of Roman consuls) that the year AD 1 corresponds to AUC 754, based on the epoch of Varro. \nThus, \n\n"}

He brought the tradition of radicalism in Russian literature to prominence with his 1790 novel \"Journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow\". His depiction of socio-economic conditions in Russia resulted in his exile to Siberia until 1797.\n\nHe was the grandfather of painter Alexey Bogolyubov.\n\nRadishchev was born on an estate just outside Moscow, into a minor noble family of Tatar descent, tracing its roots back to defeated princes who entered into the service of Ivan the Terrible after the conquest of Kazan in 1552, the Tsar offering them, in exchange of baptism, to work for him and being allotted lands of some twenty-two thousand acres, a number their descendants will keep upgrading by serving the Tsars over the generations. His father, Nicholas Afanasevich Radischev, a prominent landowner in Moscow, had a reputation for treating his 3000-plus serfs humanely. Until he was 8 years old he lived on his father's estate in Verkhni Oblyazovo (then part of the Saratov Governorate, today in Penza Oblast), one hundred miles west of the Volga river with a nurse and tutor. He then went to live with a relative in Moscow, where he was allowed to spend time at the newly established Moscow University. In 1765 his family connections provided him with an opportunity to serve as a page in Catherine's court, which he nonetheless regarded with suspicion for its \"contempt for the Orthodox faith, and a desire to deliver the homeland into foreign (German) hands\". Because of his exceptional academic promise, Radishchev was chosen as of one of a dozen young students to be sent abroad to acquire Western learning. For several years he studied at the University of Leipzig. His foreign education influenced his approach to Russian society, and upon his return he hoped to incorporate Enlightenment philosophies such as natural law and the social contract into Russian conditions. Even as he served as a Titular Councillor, drafting legal protocols, in Catherine's civil service, he lauded revolutionaries like George Washington, praised the early stages of the French Revolution, and found himself enamored of the Russian Freemason, Nicholas Ivanovich Novikov, whose publication \"The Drone\" offered the first public critiques of the government, particularly with regards to serfdom. Novikov's sharp satire and indignation inspired Radischev's most famous work – \"Journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow\" – in which he emulates Novikov's harsh and passionate style. He too was especially critical of serfdom and of the limits to personal freedom imposed by the autocracy.\n\nThe Empress Catherine the Great read the work, viewed Radishchev's calls for reform as evidence of Jacobin-style radicalism, and ordered copies of the text confiscated and destroyed. Out of the 650 copies originally printed, only 17 had survived by the time the work was reprinted in England fifty years later. In 1790 Radischev was arrested and condemned to death. He humbly begged forgiveness of Catherine, publicly disowning his book, and his sentence was commuted to exile to Ilimsk in Siberia. \"En route\" the writer was treated like a common convict, shackled at the ankles and forced to endure the Russian cold from which he eventually fell ill. His friend, Count Alexander Vorontsov, who held sway with Catherine, interceded and managed to secure Radischev more appropriate accommodations, allowing him to return to Moscow to recover and restart his journey with dignity and comfort. Beginning in October, 1790, Radischev's two-year trip took him through Siberia, stopping in the towns of Ekaterinberg, Tobolsk, and Irkutsk before reaching the small town of Ilimsk in 1792. Along the way, he began writing a biography of Yermak, the Cossack conqueror of Siberia, and pursuing an interest in geology and nature. Settling in Ilimsk for five years with his second wife, Elizabeth Vasilievna Rubanovsky, and his two children, Radischev, as the only educated man in the area, became the local doctor and saved several lives. He also wrote a long treatise, \"On Man, His Mortality, His Immortality\", revered as one of the few great philosophical works of Russia. In it he addresses man's belief in the afterlife, the corporality of the soul, the ultimate redemption of sinners and the faults of materialism.\n\nAfter Catherine's death (1796) her successor Tsar Paul recalled Radishchev from Siberia and confined him to his own estate; the writer again attempted to push for reforms in Russia's government. When Alexander I became Emperor (1801), Radishchev was briefly employed to help revise Russian law, a realization of his lifelong dream. Unfortunately, his tenure in this administrative role proved short and unsuccessful. In 1802 a despondent Radishchev - possibly rebuked in a friendly manner, for expressing radical ideas, by Count Zavadovsky who in his reproof spoke of another exile to Siberia - committed suicide by drinking poison.\n\nDuring the author's last years, his Moscow apartment became the center of several literary circles who extolled similar views and most outspokenly mourned his death. The Russian autocracy, however, managed to prevent \"A Journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow\" from being published until 1905, during which time it circulated through radical groups and was translated into several languages. Alexander Pushkin, sympathetic to Radischev's views and passion, undertook to write a sequel to his inflammatory book, which was unfortunately never finished and early on faced pressure from the censors. Following the 1905 and 1917 revolutions, however, Radischev was accepted into the radical canon and became widely read throughout Russia and Europe. Despite the discrepancies between the author's ideal and the Soviet reality, authorities managed to paint him as \"a materialist, an active fighter against autocratic tyranny, and a veritable forefather of Bolshevism.\"\n\nAs a true student of the Enlightenment, Radischev held views that favored the freedom of the individual, Humanism, and patriotism. These values are best summed up by “equality of all classes before the law, abolition of the Table of Ranks, trial by jury, religious toleration, freedom of the press, emancipation of manorial serfs, habeas corpus, and freedom of trade”. Upon his return from Leipzig in 1771, Radischev saw with fresh eyes the stark contrast between life under liberal Western states like England and Switzerland and that under Russia's autocracy. Echoing the sentiments of Catherine herself, he advocated education for all classes, a system he had the fortune to witness in a school in Irkutsk. A more educated populace would provide the foundation for an eventual republican or parliamentary system. Of all of Russia's social ills, Radischev especially despised the inequality and prolongation of serfdom, rooted in a traditional social system that enforced a strict hierarchy and permitted abuses and exploitation. Ironically, under Catherine's enlightened reign, serfdom was intensified and spread to newly conquered territories. While in Siberia, Radischev's economic thought developed, not only in terms of decreasing dependence on serfdom but denouncing international trade. Though influenced by Adam Smith, Radischev maintained protectionist views, condemning unnecessary international trade and proposing stronger domestic production. In the debate over Sino-Russian trade relations, he believed Russia's own resources were enough to support it.\n\nCriticizing the history of arbitrary rule in Russia, Radischev called autocracy the system of governance \"most contrary to human nature\". Under this system, government was better positioned to breach its social contract with the governed, creating an unjust and oppressed society. He extends this system to master-serf relations as well, noting that seeking unlimited power is a natural human vice. Radischev does not sweepingly criticize all autocrats, but only tyrants, praising, in fact, Lycurgus, the philosopher king of Sparta who promoted equality and civil rights. Radischev, however, did not believe in, or desire, bloody revolution and instead hoped for a reforming autocrat who would abolish serfdom and \"maintain equality in society, protect the widow and the orphan and save the innocent from harm\". As a member of the ruling class, he didn’t seek to overturn autocracy but to persuade his countrymen and superiors to give up some of their vested power. In no way an idealist, the writer acknowledged that “where there was more enlightenment, where there was more social life, there was more corruption, so inseparable are good and evil on the earth.”\n\nRadischev's religious and philosophical views were incredibly liberal for his time. Denying the belief that sensory experience is primary, Radischev, in \"On Man, His Mortality, His Immortality\", speaks in favor of man's higher virtues as the main elements in complex human thought. He believed that man's hereditary faculties have as much influence on his development as the external environment. He also points out, however, that there are common, innate traits that bind all people, particularly the belief in a higher power. The belief in immortality remains particularly potent for him, both as a factor of faith and as a solace amidst the difficulties of life.\n\n"}

His theories about romance are shown when he describes the angst of the main character, Luís da Silva: suffering, anxiety, a feeling of sickness. It's curious to say but there's an influence from the psychoanalysis, too, when the imagined disease of Luís da Silva begins to change his behavior and his sense of reality.

It was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on November 20, 2018. Those who pre-ordered the Deluxe Edition of the game were granted early access to the game on November 15, 2018, and Origin Access Premium subscribers on PC received access to the game on 9 November 2018. The game is based on World War II and is a thematic continuation of its World War I based precursor \"Battlefield 1\".\n\nPre-release reception of the game was mixed, with the announcement trailer causing backlash from fans of the series for a perceived lack of historical accuracy and the inclusion of female soldiers. Upon release, \"Battlefield V\" received generally favourable reviews from critics. \n\n\"Battlefield V\" will focus extensively on party-based features and mechanics, scarcity of resources, and removing \"abstractions\" from game mechanics to increase realism. There will be an expanded focus on player customization through the new Company system, where players will be able to create multiple characters with various cosmetic and weapon options. Cosmetic items, and currency used to purchase others, will be earned by completing in-game objectives.\n\nThe game will feature several new multiplayer modes, including the \"continuous\" campaign mode \"Tides of War\", \"Firestorm\", and \"Grand Operations\". The Grand Operations mode is an expansion of the \"Operations\" mode introduced in \"Battlefield 1\", which focuses on matches taking place across multiple stages to simulate a campaign from the war. In Grand Operations, each round will have specific objectives, and performance in each stage will influence the next. Games will culminate with a \"Final Stand\", with players using only a primary weapon with limited ammo, and no respawns. Similarly to \"Battlefield 1\", the game will feature a collection of single-player \"war stories\" based on aspects of World War II. The game also features a cooperative mode not seen since \"Battlefield 3\" called \"Combined Arms\", where four players can undertake missions together and features dynamic missions and objectives so missions cannot be played the same way each time. Combined Arms is scheduled to be released after launch. The Battle Royale mode will be built around the franchise's \"core pillars of destruction, team play, and vehicles\". The name \"Firestorm\" is derived from a literal storm of fire that engulfs players similar to the popular Battle Royale game mechanic of restricting the play area. Furthermore, this particular game mode is not being developed by EA DICE themselves, but has been outsourced to Criterion Games and features the biggest map created by the franchise to date. It is playable by 64 players, which are divided into up to 16 squads with a focus on team work. Firestorm is scheduled to be released in March 2019.\n\nAs in \"Battlefield 1\", the single-player campaign is divided into episodic \"War Stories,\" three of which are available at launch: \"Nordlys\" takes place from the point-of-view of a Norwegian resistance fighter taking part in the sabotage of the German nuclear program, \"Tirailleur\" tells the story of a Senegalese Tirallieur during Operation Dragoon, and \"Under No Flag\" puts the player in the shoes of Billy Bridger, a convicted bank robber and explosives expert conscripted into the Special Boat Service to take part in Operation Albumen. A fourth campaign, \"The Last Tiger\", will launch later.\n\nDICE unveiled the first details surrounding \"Battlefield V\" on May 23, 2018, with more information to be unveiled during the EA Play press conference near E3 2018 in June. DICE has stated that, unlike \"Battlefield 1\", it does not plan to use paid downloadable content, or \"loot boxes\" for non-cosmetic items within \"Battlefield V\"; new content will be added to the game for all players over time (which, itself, will progress through the different stages of World War II), at no additional charge. The decision to exclude these features was made following the outrage over the loot box system in \"Star Wars Battlefront II\", another EA DICE title. The game was originally set to release on October 19, but was delayed to November 20 to enable the developers to \"make some final adjustments to core gameplay\".\n\nThe announcement trailer was met with a backlash from fans of the series who criticized the game for a lack of historical accuracy and authenticity. Complaints were given to the use of certain weapons, prosthetics, and body art as being very uncommon in that time period. Some fans were also frustrated with the portrayal of women in the game, specifically with the British woman featured in the trailer as British women never participated in frontline combat and were mostly relegated to supporting roles. Although acknowledging that British women were rarely on the frontline, critics have responded that female soldiers did participate in World War II, highlighting real-life examples from multiple countries, and that previous games in the \"Battlefield\" series are not seen as a completely realistic portrayal of war. Some also suggested that the backlash was partly due to misogyny, rather than genuine worries over historical accuracy.\n\nIn response to the outcry, the game's executive producer Aleksander Grøndal wrote on Twitter that the team would \"always put fun over authentic.\" DICE's general manager Oskar Gabrielson also responded on Twitter, saying \"Player choice and female playable characters are here to stay ... Our commitment as a studio is to do everything we can to create games that are inclusive and diverse. We always set out to push boundaries and deliver unexpected experiences.\" EA chief creative officer Patrick Söderlund said the developer was uninterested in taking flak for diversifying the gaming space. \"We stand up for the cause, because I think those people who don’t understand it, well, you have two choices: either accept it or don’t buy the game,\" he said. \"I’m fine with either or.\" Söderlund went on to say that the development team itself pushed for women in \"Battlefield V\". In September, after the game was delayed by a month, DICE revealed they are planning on \"dialing back\" the character customization to attempt to \"give more authenticity to the game\", saying \"We want players to be excited about customizing their characters with authentic gear. We dialed it back a bit. It was pretty crazy, We wanted to offer some authenticity, and that’s important to us, that’s important to our players.”\n\nIn August, the Cowen Group, gaming industry analysts, reported that pre-order sales of \"Battlefield V\" were \"weak\", being 85% behind those of \"\".\n\nAccording to review aggregator Metacritic, \"Battlefield V\" received \"generally favourable\" reviews for the PC and Xbox One versions and \"mixed or average\" reviews for the PlayStation 4 version.\n\nIn \"GameInformer\"s 8/10 review, they wrote, \"Ultimately, \"Battlefield V\" will be defined by the success or failure of the pending Combined Arms cooperative mode, Firestorm battle royale mode, and whether or not DICE can continually provide new and engaging content.\" \"GamesRadar+\" gave the game 3.5/5 stars, praising the gameplay but criticizing the online multiplayer, writing: \"Not as drastic a change up as its WW1 predecessor, nor as wild or wondrous, \"Battlefield 5\"s deliberative design sidelines its strengths as a simulative sandbox.\"\n\nIn November, it was reported that \"Battlefield V\" sold fewer than half the physical copies that \"Battlefield 1\" did upon its launch during the same period of time.\n"}

{"id": "7431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7431", "title": "Counter-Strike (video game)", "text": "Counter-Strike (video game)\n\nCounter-Strike (also known as Half-Life: Counter-Strike) is a first-person shooter video game developed by Valve Corporation. It was initially developed and released as a \"Half-Life\" modification by Minh \"Gooseman\" Le and Jess Cliffe in 1999, before Le and Cliffe were hired and the game's intellectual property acquired. \"Counter-Strike\" was released by Valve on the Microsoft Windows platform in 2000. The game spawned a franchise, and is the first installment in the \"Counter-Strike\" series. Several remakes and ports of \"Counter-Strike\" have been released on the Xbox console, as well as OS X and Linux. It is commonly referred to as Counter-Strike 1.6 to distinguish it from other titles of the series, 1.6 being the final major software update the game received.\n\nSet in various locations around the globe, players assume the roles of members of combating teams of the governmental counter-terrorist forces and various terrorist militants opposing them. During each round of gameplay, the two teams are tasked with defeating the other by the means of either achieving the map's objectives, or else eliminating all of the enemy combatants. Each player may customize their arsenal of weapons and accessories at the beginning of every match, with currency being earned after the end of each round.\n\n\"Counter-Strike\" is a first-person shooter game in which players join either the terrorist team, the counter-terrorist team, or become spectators. Each team attempts to complete their mission objective and/or eliminate the opposing team. Each round starts with the two teams spawning simultaneously. All players have only one life by default and start with a pistol as well as a knife.\n\nThe objectives vary depending on the type of map, and these are the most usual ones:\n\nA player can choose to play as one of eight different default character models (four for each side, although \"\" added two extra models, bringing the total to ten). Players are generally given a few seconds before the round begins (known as \"freeze time\") to prepare and buy equipment, during which they cannot attack or move. They can return to the buy area within a set amount of time to buy more equipment (some custom maps included neutral \"buy zones\" that could be used by both teams). Once the round has ended, surviving players retain their equipment for use in the next round; players who were killed begin the next round with the basic default starting equipment.\n\nStandard monetary bonuses are awarded for winning a round, losing a round, killing an enemy, being the first to instruct a hostage to follow, rescuing a hostage, planting the bomb (Terrorist) or defusing the bomb (Counter-Terrorist).\n\nThe scoreboard displays team scores in addition to statistics for each player: name, kills, deaths, and ping (in milliseconds). The scoreboard also indicates whether a player is dead, carrying the bomb (on bomb maps), or is the VIP (on assassination maps), although information on players on the opposing team is hidden from a player until his/her death, as this information can be important.\n\nKilled players become \"spectators\" for the duration of the round; they cannot change their names before their next spawn, text chat cannot be sent to or received from live players, and voice chat can only be received from live players and not sent to them. Spectators are generally able to watch the rest of the round from multiple selectable views, although some servers disable some of these views to prevent dead players from relaying information about living players to their teammates through alternative media (most notably voice in the case of Internet cafes and Voice over IP programs such as TeamSpeak or Ventrilo). This form of cheating is known as \"ghosting.\"\n\n\"Counter-Strike\" itself is a mod, and it has developed its own community of script writers and mod creators. Some mods add bots, while others remove features of the game, and others create different modes of play. Some mods, often called \"admin plugins\", give server administrators more flexible and efficient control over their servers. There are some mods which affect gameplay heavily, such as Gun Game, where players start with a basic pistol and must score kills to receive better weapons, and Zombie Mod, where one team consists of zombies and must \"spread the infection\" by killing the other team (using only the knife). There are also the Superhero and mods which mix the first-person gameplay of \"Counter-Strike\" with an experience system, allowing a player to become more powerful as they continue to play. The game is also highly customizable on the player's end, allowing the user to install or even create their own custom skins, HUDs, spray graphics, sprites, and sound effects, given the proper tools.\n\n\"Counter-Strike\" has been a target for cheating in online games since its release. In-game, cheating is often referred to as \"hacking\" in reference to programs or \"hacks\" executed by the client. Valve has implemented an anti-cheat system called Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC). Players cheating on a VAC-enabled server risk having their account permanently banned from all VAC-secured servers.\n\nWith the first version of VAC, a ban took hold almost instantly after being detected and the cheater had to wait two years to have the account unbanned. Since VAC's second version, cheaters are not banned automatically. With the second version, Valve instituted a policy of 'delayed bans,' the theory being that if a new hack is developed which circumvents the VAC system, it will spread amongst the 'cheating' community. By delaying the initial ban, Valve hopes to identify and ban as many cheaters as possible. Like any software detection system, some cheats are not detected by VAC. To remedy this, some servers implement a voting system, in which case players can call for a vote to kick or ban the accused cheater. VAC's success at identifying cheats and banning those who use them has also provided a boost in the purchasing of private cheats. These cheats are updated frequently to minimize the risk of detection, and are generally only available to a trusted list of recipients who collectively promise not to reveal the underlying design. Even with private cheats however, some servers have alternative anticheats to coincide with VAC itself. This can help with detecting some cheaters, but most paid for cheats are designed to bypass these alternative server-based anticheats.\n\nWhen \"Counter-Strike\" was published by Sierra Studios, it was bundled with \"Team Fortress Classic\", \"\" multiplayer, and the \"Wanted\", \"Half-Life: Absolute Redemption\" and \"Firearms\" mods.\n\nOn March 24, 1999, Planet Half-Life opened its \"Counter-Strike\" section. Within two weeks, the site had received 10,000 hits. On June 19, 1999, the first public beta of \"Counter-Strike\" was released, followed by numerous further \"beta\" releases. On April 12, 2000, Valve announced that the \"Counter-Strike\" developers and Valve had teamed up. In January 2013, Valve began testing a version of \"Counter-Strike\" for OS X and Linux, eventually releasing the update to all users in April 2013.\n\nUpon its retail release, \"Counter-Strike\" received highly favorable reviews. \"The New York Times\" reported that E-Sports Entertainment ESEA League started the first professional fantasy e-sports league in 2004 with the game \"Counter-Strike\". Some credit the move into professional competitive team play with prizes as a major factor in \"Counter-Strike\" longevity and success.\n\nGlobal retail sales of \"Counter-Strike\" surpassed 250,000 units by July 2001, and 1.5 million by December 2003. In the United States alone, its retail version sold 550,000 copies and earned $15.7 million by August 2006, after its release in November 2000. It was the country's 22nd best-selling computer game between January 2000 and August 2006.\n\nOn January 17, 2008, a Brazilian federal court order prohibiting all sales of \"Counter-Strike\" and \"EverQuest\" began to be enforced. The federal Brazilian judge Carlos Alberto Simões de Tomaz ordered the ban in October 2007 because, as argued by the judge, the games \"bring imminent stimulus to the subversion of the social order, attempting against the democratic state and the law and against public security.\" As of June 18, 2009, a regional federal court order lifting the prohibition on the sale of \"Counter-Strike\" was published. The game is now being sold again in Brazil.\n\nFollowing the success of the first \"Counter-Strike\", Valve went on to make multiple sequels to the game. \"\", a game using \"Counter-Strike's\" GoldSrc engine, was released in 2004. \"\", a remake of the original \"Counter-Strike\" game, was the first in the series to use Valve's Source engine and was also released in 2004, only eight months after the release of \"Counter-Strike: Condition Zero\". The next game in the \"Counter-Strike\" series to be developed primarily by Valve Corporation was \"\", released for Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 in 2012.\n\nThe game also spawned multiple spin-offs in the form of arcade games developed by Nexon Corporation and targeted primarily at Asian gaming markets. Four \"Counter-Strike\" games have been developed and released by Nexon Corporation thus far, \"Counter-Strike Neo\", \"Counter-Strike Online\", \"\", and \"Counter-Strike Online 2\".\n\n"}

It can also indicate social, marital or religious status. If the costume is used to represent the culture or identity of a specific ethnic group, it is usually known as ethnic costume (also ethnic dress, ethnic wear, ethnic clothing, traditional ethnic wear or traditional ethnic garment). Such costumes often come in two forms: one for everyday occasions, the other for traditional festivals and formal wear.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of romantic nationalism, the peasantry of Europe came to serve as models for all that appeared genuine and desirable. Their dress crystallised into so-called \"typical\" forms, and enthusiasts adopted that attire as part of their symbolism.\n\nIn areas where Western dress codes have become usual, traditional garments are often worn at special events or celebrations; particularly those connected with cultural traditions, heritage or pride. International events may cater for non-Western attendees with a compound dress code such as \"business suit or national dress\".\n\nIn modern times, there are instances where traditional garments are required by sumptuary laws. In Bhutan, the traditional Tibetan-style clothing of \"gho\" and \"kera\" for men, and \"kira\" and \"toego\" for women, must be worn by all citizens, including those not of Tibetan heritage. In Saudi Arabia, women are also required to wear the abaya in public.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was a son of Leuthard I, Count of Fézensac and of Paris, and his wife Grimildis.\n\nGirart is not described as being from Roussillon in authentic historical sources. The placename in his title is derived from a castle he built on Mont Lassois, near Vix and Châtillon-sur-Seine (Côte-d'Or).\n\nGirart de Roussillon also is an epic figure in the cycle of Carolingian romances, collectively known as the \"Matter of France.\" In the genealogy of the cycle’s legendary heroes, Girart is a son of Doon de Mayence and appears in the various irreconcilable events.\n\nGirart fought at the Battle of Fontenay in 841, and doubtless followed Lothair I, his future brother-in-law, to Aix-en-Provence. In 843, he married Bertha, daughter of Lothair I (May 800 - Sep 855) and Ermengarde of Tours (800-851). Hugh II (780-837) was Bertha's grandfather.\n\nIn 855, Girart became governor of Provence for Lothair's son Charles, nominal king of Provence. His wife Bertha defended Vienne unsuccessfully against Charles the Bald in 870. Girart, who had perhaps aspired to be the titular ruler of the northern part of Provence, continued to administer it under Lothair II until that prince's death in 869. He retired with his wife to Avignon where he died probably in 877, certainly before 879.\n\nThe legend of Girart’s piety, the heroism of his wife Bertha, and of his wars with Charles passed into the genre of literary romance; however, the historical facts are so distorted that, in the epic \"Girart de Roussillon\", he became an opponent of Charles Martel who was married to Bertha's sister. The legendary narrative \"Girart de Roussillon\" was long held to be a Provençal work, but its Burgundian origin has been proven.\n\nAccounts of Girart are found in several early manuscripts. The earliest \"chanson de geste\", called \"Le Chanson de Girart de Roussillon\", dates from the second half of the 12th century. The original text, written in rhymed decasyllables, is preserved at the Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF). It was translated the first time by Paul Meyer in 1884, (Paris: Champion). A recent translation into modern French with notes by Micheline Combarieu du Grès and Gérard Gouiran was published in 1993 (Paris: Librairie générale française).\n\nA romance written in rhymed alexandrines was written between 1330 and 1349 by monks in the abbey of Pothières, which was founded in about 860 by Girart. It was dedicated to Odo IV, Duke of Burgundy (ca. 1295–1350), and Jeanne de Bourgogne (called \"Joan the Lame\"), queen of France (1293–1349). The text is composed in a dialect midway between French and Old Occitan. Five manuscript copies of this version survive; two in Montpellier, France at the Bibliothèque Interuniversitaire (section médecine), one in Troyes (now held at the Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal in Paris), one in Paris at the BnF, and one in Brussels at the Bibliothèque royale de Belgique. This version was printed by Yale University in 1939 (New Haven: Yale University Press, Yale Romanic Studies, 16).\n\nThe version in Alexandrines was the source for a romance in prose by Jehan Wauquelin in 1447 (Paris: éd. L. de Montille, 1880).\n\nSouthern French traditions concerning Girart, in which he is called the son of Garin de Monglane, are embodied in the 13th century narrative in rhymed decasyllable verses about the siege of Vienne by Charlemagne in \"Girart de Vienne\" by Bertrand de Bar-sur-l'Aube. The same traditions also are embraced in \"Aspramonte\" by Andrea da Barberino, based on the French \"chanson\" \"Aspremont\", where he is called Girart de Frete or de Fraite and he leads an army of infidels against Charlemagne.\n\n\n\n"}

It was usually said to be in Abkhazia and was officially known as Hanyson or Hamson (or some variation; the name apparently comes from the Hamshen area of Turkey), or simply the Forest of Abkhazia.\n\nThe Land of Darkness enjoyed popularity in fictional medieval travel literature such as the \"Alexander Romance\" and the \"Travels of Sir John Mandeville\". According to Mandeville, no one ventures into Hanyson out of fear, but the people in the surrounding area know it to be populated, as they can hear human voices inside. The residents of Hanyson are the descendants of Persian Emperor Saures (Shapur II) and his men, who were trapped there forever by a miracle of God. Saures had been persecuting his Christian subjects in Abkhazia, and had cornered them on a plain. They prayed to God, and God responded by surrounding the king's armies in the thick, impenetrable darkness that still affected the land. In the \"Alexander Romance\", Alexander the Great crosses the Land of Darkness in his search for the Water of Life. After passing through Russia and coming almost to the edge of the world, Alexander finds the darkened country and travels it with his servant Andreas (in the Persian version of the \"Romance\", this servant is identified with Al-Khidr, the hero from the Qur'an). Alexander cannot find his way through the darkness, but his servant does. Andreas drinks of the Water of Life and becomes immortal.\n\nThe Land of Darkness was also identified with the area around the northern Ural Mountains. When Abu Hamid al-Gharnati visited Volga Bulgaria in 1135-36 he was told that the Land of Darkness was not far from Yugra. \n\nIbn Battuta was in the same area and wanted to visit the Land of Darkness but decided not to because it required a 40-day journey on \"small wagons drawn by large dogs.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "19136234", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19136234", "title": "Ludi", "text": "Ludi\n\nLudi (Latin plural) were public games held for the benefit and entertainment of the Roman people (\"populus Romanus\"). \"Ludi\" were held in conjunction with, or sometimes as the major feature of, Roman religious festivals, and were also presented as part of the cult of state.\n\nThe earliest \"ludi\" were horse races in the circus (\"ludi circenses\"). Animal exhibitions with mock hunts (\"venationes\") and theatrical performances (\"ludi scaenici\") also became part of the festivals.\n\nDays on which \"ludi\" were held were public holidays, and no business could be conducted — \"remarkably,\" it has been noted, \"considering that in the Imperial era more than 135 days might be spent at these entertainments\" during the year. Although their entertainment value may have overshadowed religious sentiment at any given moment, even in late antiquity the \"ludi\" were understood as part of the worship of the traditional gods, and the Church Fathers thus advised Christians not to participate in the festivities.\n\nThe singular form ludus, \"game, sport\" or \"play\" has several meanings in Latin. The plural is used for \"games\" in a sense analogous to the Greek festivals of games, such as the Panhellenic Games. The late-antique scholar Isidore of Seville, however, classifies the forms of \"ludus\" as \"gymnicus\" (\"athletic\"), \"circensis\" (\"held in the circus,\" mainly the chariot races), \"gladiatorius\" (\"gladiatorial\") and \"scaenicus\" (\"theatrical\"). The relation of gladiatorial games to the \"ludi\" is complex; see Gladiator.\n\nOriginally, all \"ludi\" seem to have been votive offerings (\"ludi votivi\"), staged as the fulfillment of a vow to a deity whose favor had been sought and evidenced. In 366 BC, the \"Ludi Romani\" became the first games to be placed on the religious calendar as an annual event sponsored by the state as a whole. Games in the circus were preceded by a parade \"(pompa circensis)\" featuring the competitors, mounted youths of the Roman nobility, armed dancers, musicians, a satyr chorus, and images of the gods. As the product of military victory, \"ludi\" were often connected to triumphs. The first recorded \"venatio\" (staged beast hunt) was presented in 186 BC by M. Fulvius Nobilior as part of his \"ludi votivi\", for which he paid with booty displayed at his triumph.\n\nAs religious ceremonies, \"ludi\" were organized at first by various colleges of priests; during the Republic, they were later presented by consuls, but became most associated with the responsibilities of the aediles. Although public money was allocated for the staging of \"ludi\", the presiding official increasingly came to augment the splendor of his games from personal funds as a form of public relations. The sponsor was able to advertise his wealth, while declaring that he intended to share it for public benefit. Although some men with an eye on the consulship skipped the office of aedile for the very reason that massive expenditures were expected, those with sufficient resources spent lavishly to cultivate the favor of the people. The religious festivals to which the \"ludi\" were attached also occasioned public banquets, and often public works such as the refurbishing or building of temples.\nFollowing the assassination of Julius Caesar at the Ides of March in 44 BC, Marcus Brutus realized that a significant segment of the \"populus\" regarded him not as a liberator, but as the murderer of a beloved champion, and among other gestures of goodwill toward the people, he arranged to sponsor the \"Ludi Apollinares\", held annually July 6–13. Caesar's heir Octavian at once upstaged him with \"Ludi Victoriae Caesaris\", \"games in honor of Caesar's victory,\" which ran July 20–28 in conjunction with a festival to honor Venus Genetrix, Caesar's patron deity and divine matriarch of the Julian \"gens\". It was during these \"ludi\", which also served as funeral games, that the comet famously appeared to \"announce\" Caesar's newly divine status. Octavian recognized the value of the festivals in unifying the people, and as Augustus instituted new \"ludi\" within his program of religious reform; public spectacles and entertainments were thus subsumed by Imperial cult.\n\nThe \"ludi compitalicii\" (\"crossroads games\") were entertainments staged by the neighborhoods or community associations of Rome (\"vici\") in conjunction with the Compitalia, the new year festival held on movable dates between the Saturnalia and January 5 in honor of the crossroads Lares. In the late Republic, performances were held at the main intersections of neighborhoods throughout the city on the same day. During the civil wars of the 80s, these \"ludi\" gave rise to often unruly plebeian political expression by the neighborhood organizations. Freedmen played a leading role, and even slaves participated in the festivities.\n\nIn 67 BC, the Compitalia had been disrupted by a riot at the \"ludi\", which were also the scene of disturbances in 66–65 BC. This unrest on the first occasion was a response to the trial of Manilius, who had backed reforms pertaining to the voting rights of freedmen, and on the second is attached to the murky events later referred to misleadingly as the First Catilinarian Conspiracy. Along with some forms of occupational guilds (\"collegia\") and neighborhood associations, the \"ludi compitalicii\" were consequently banned by the senate in 64 BC.\n\nAn unnamed tribune of the \"plebs\" supported efforts to stage the \"ludi\" for 61 BC, but the consul-designate Metellus Celer squelched the attempt. In 58 BC, Clodius Pulcher, who had given up his patrician status to become one of the people's tribunes, restored the right of association, but even before his law was enacted, his aide Sextus Cloelius had prepared the way by organizing new-year \"ludi\". The consul Calpurnius Piso, father-in-law of Caesar, permitted the games, even though the organizations that ran them were still outlawed. Caesar banned the \"collegia\" and \"ludi\" again in 46 BC.\n\nIn 7 BC, Augustus reorganized Rome for administrative purposes into 265 districts which replaced but which were still called \"vici\". An image of the Genius of Augustus now stood between the Lares at the crossroads shrines, and the \"ludi\" once considered dangerously subversive became expressions of Imperial piety.\n\n\"Ludi circenses\" were games presented in the circus. The Circus Maximus was primarily a venue for chariot races, but other athletic events, races, and beast hunts might be offered as well. The games were preceded by an opening parade, the \"pompa circensis\". \"Ludi circenses\" were regularly featured in celebrating a triumph or dedicating a major building. They were part of the most important holidays and festivals, such as the Floralia, \"Ludi Romani\" (\"Roman Games\"), and \"Ludi Plebeii\" (\"Plebeian Games\"). During the Imperial era, circus games were often added to festivals for which they were not traditionally celebrated in the Republic. Circus games were held in various provinces throughout the empire, as indicated by archaeological remains of tracks and supporting structures, although many areas would have lacked costly permanent facilities and instead erected temporary stands around suitable grounds.\n\nThe following lists of \"ludi\" are not exhaustive. Unless otherwise noted, the sources are Matthew Bunson, \"A Dictionary of the Roman Empire\" (Oxford University Press, 1995), pp. 246–247, and Roland Auguet, \"Cruelty and Civilization: The Roman Games\" (Routledge, 1972, 1994) pp. 212–213.\n\nListed in order by month as they appear on the Roman calendar.\n\n\nThe following \"ludi\" were held only once.\n\n"}

On a far ring planet, known as \"World Called Maanerek\" by its inhabitants, only a weak memory of Earth has survived, and technology has declined to preindustrial. Maanerek is coveted by a highly developed civilization because it is situated at a location of strategical value.\n\nAs the story opens, the protagonist \"Torrek\" jumps down onto a large bird with a wing spread of nine meters, kills it and lands with it in the sea, to prove himself worthy of marrying \"Sonna\", a girl of the local tribe.\n\nTorrek and Sonna are seized in invisible bonds and abducted in a spaceship. It is revealed that Torrek was a member of the same military unit of the abductors. In a neurological experiment, he has been sent to Maanerek with his memory emptied, for the sake of infiltrating the natives so that they willingly cooperate. The natives have accepted him as a somewhat strange, but friendly fellow.\n\nWith his memory restored, Torrek begins talking as if no time had passed, sharing all the biased views of his military comrades about the natives. He now considers himself the officer \"Korul Wanen\" again, and reproaches his leaders for having sent him to the planet, because he could have died there.\n\nThey bring him to the girl, hoping to obtain information from her that will make it easier to eradicate her people; but Wanen still feels a strong sympathy towards her. To change that, he is commanded to rape and to kill her. Wanen finds confederates and frees Sonna forcefully. He steals a spaceship and flees, leaving his earlier \"civilised\" companions behind him, in a fireball. \n\nThough his memory of having been Torrek is gone, Wanen's loyalty is now with the inhabitants of the planet, whom he would help to develop technologically and be better prepared for any new incursion by his former compatriots. \n\nMany competing groups try, each in its own way, to reunite the disparate planets of the former Empire. \n\n\"Memory\" was first published in the Science Fiction magazine Galaxy. It was published together with six other narrations by Anderson in the collection \"Beyond the Beyond\", in 1969.\n\n"}
{"id": "23139208", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23139208", "title": "Middle-earth", "text": "Middle-earth\n\nMiddle-earth is the fictional setting of much of British writer J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium.\nThe term is equivalent to the term \"Midgard\" of Norse mythology, describing the human-inhabited world, that is, the central continent of the Earth in Tolkien's imagined mythological past.\n\nTolkien's most widely read works, \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\", take place entirely in Middle-earth, and \"Middle-earth\" has also become a short-hand to refer to the legendarium and Tolkien's fictional take on the world.\n\nWithin his stories, Tolkien translated the name \"Middle-earth\" as \"Endor\" (or sometimes \"Endórë\") and \"Ennor\" in the Elvish languages Quenya and Sindarin respectively, sometimes referring only to the continent that the stories take place on, with another southern continent called the Dark Land.\n\nMiddle-earth is the north continent of Earth (\"Arda\") in an imaginary period of the Earth's past (Tolkien placed the end of the Third Age at about 6,000 years before his own time), in the sense of a \"secondary or sub-creational reality\". Its general position is reminiscent of Europe, with the environs of the Shire intended to be reminiscent of England (more specifically, the West Midlands, with Hobbiton set at the same latitude as Oxford).\n\nTolkien's stories chronicle the struggle to control the world (called Arda) and the continent of Middle-earth: on one side, the angelic Valar, the Elves and their allies among Men; on the other, the demonic Melkor or \"Morgoth\" (a Vala fallen into evil) and his minions, mostly Orcs, Dragons and enslaved Men. In later ages, after Morgoth's defeat and expulsion from Arda, his place was taken by his lieutenant Sauron.\n\nThe Valar withdrew from direct involvement in the affairs of Middle-earth after the defeat of Morgoth, but in later years they sent the wizards or Istari to help in the struggle against Sauron. The most important wizards were Gandalf the Grey and Saruman the White. Gandalf remained true to his mission and proved crucial in the fight against Sauron. Saruman, however, became corrupted and sought to establish himself as a rival to Sauron for absolute power in Middle-earth. Other races involved in the struggle against evil were Dwarves, Ents and most famously Hobbits. The early stages of the conflict are chronicled in \"The Silmarillion\", while the final stages of the struggle to defeat Sauron are told in \"The Hobbit\" and in \"The Lord of the Rings\".\n\nConflict over the possession and control of precious or magical objects is a recurring theme in the stories. The First Age is dominated by the doomed quest of the elf Fëanor and most of his Noldorin clan to recover three precious jewels called the Silmarils that Morgoth stole from them (hence the title \"The Silmarillion\"). The Second and Third Age are dominated by the forging of the Rings of Power, and the fate of the One Ring forged by Sauron, which gives its wearer the power to control or influence those wearing the other Rings of Power (hence the title \"The Lord of the Rings\").\n\nIn ancient Germanic mythology, the world of Men is known by several names, such as Midgard, Middenheim, Manaheim, and Middengeard. The Old English \"middangeard\" descends from an earlier Germanic word and so has cognates in languages related to Old English such as the Old Norse word \"Miðgarðr\" from Norse mythology, transliterated to modern English as \"Midgard\".\n\nThe term \"Middle-earth\"; also commonly referred to as \"middle-world,\" was therefore not invented by Tolkien. It is found throughout the Modern English period as a development of the Middle English word \"middel-erde\" (cf. modern German \"Mittelerde\"), which developed in turn, through a process of folk etymology, from \"middanġeard\" (the \"g\" being soft, i.e. pronounced like \"y\" in its modern descendant \"yard\"). By the time of the Middle English period, \"middangeard\" was being written as \"middellærd\", \"midden-erde\", or \"middel-erde\", indicating that the second element had been reinterpreted, based on its similarity to the word for \"earth\". The shift in meaning was not great, however: \"middangeard\" properly meant \"middle enclosure\" instead of \"middle-earth\"; Nevertheless, \"middangeard\" has been commonly translated as \"middle-earth\" and Tolkien followed this course.\n\nTolkien first encountered the term \"middangeard\" in an Old English fragment he studied in 1914:\n\n\"Éala éarendel engla beorhtast / ofer middangeard monnum sended.\"\nHail Earendel, brightest of angels / above the middle-earth sent unto men.\n\nThis quote is from the second of the fragmentary remnants of the Crist poems by Cynewulf. The name \"Éarendel\" was the inspiration for Tolkien's mariner Eärendil, who set sail from the lands of Middle-earth to ask for aid from the angelic powers, the Valar. Tolkien's earliest poem about Eärendil, from 1914, the same year he read the Crist poems, refers to \"the mid-world's rim\".\n\nThe concept of \"middangeard\" was considered by Tolkien to be the same as a particular usage of the Greek word - \"oikoumenē\" (from which the word ecumenical is derived). In this usage Tolkien says that the \"oikoumenē\" is \"the abiding place of men\"; by this he means it is the physical world in which Man lives out his life and destiny, as opposed to the unseen worlds, like Heaven or Hell. Tolkien wrote:\n\nHowever, the term \"Middle-earth\" is not found in Tolkien's earliest writings about Middle-earth, dating from the early 1920s and published in \"The Book of Lost Tales\" (1983-4). Nor is the term used in \"The Hobbit\" (1937). Tolkien began to use the term \"Middle-earth\" in the late 1930s, in place of the earlier terms \"Great Lands\", \"Outer Lands\", and \"Hither Lands\". The term \"Middle-earth\" appears in drafts of \"The Lord of the Rings\", and the first published appearance of the word \"Middle-earth\" in Tolkien's works is in the Prologue to that work: \"... Hobbits had, in fact, lived quietly in Middle-earth for many long years before other folk even became aware of them.\"\n\nThe term Middle-earth has also come to be applied as a short-hand for the entirety of Tolkien's legendarium, instead of the technically more appropriate, but lesser known terms \"Arda\" (which refers to the physical world) and \"Eä\" (which refers to the physical reality of creation as a whole).\n\nThis wider use is reflected in book titles such as \"The Complete Guide to Middle-earth\", \"The Road to Middle-earth\", \"The Atlas of Middle-earth\", and in particular the series \"The History of Middle-earth\", all of which cover areas outside of the strict geographical definition of the term Middle-earth. Tolkien himself used the term loosely at times.\n\nThe term \"Middle-earth\" is sometimes incorrectly capitalised as \"Middle-Earth\", and the hyphen is sometimes incorrectly omitted as well, as in \"Middle Earth\", \"Middle earth\" and \"Middleearth\".\n\nWithin the overall context of his legendarium, Tolkien's Middle-earth was part of his created world of Arda (which includes the Undying Lands of Aman and Eressëa, removed from the rest of the physical world), which itself was part of the wider creation he called Eä.\n\nAman and Middle-earth are separated from each other by the Great Sea Belegaer (analogous to the Atlantic Ocean). \nThe western continent, Aman, was the home of the Valar and the Elves called the Eldar.\n\nThe eastern side of Middle-earth was washed by the Eastern Sea. Beyond this lay an uninhabited Eastern continent, but this does not figure in the stories. \n\nMost of the events of in Tolkien's stories take place in the north-west of Middle-earth. In the First Age the north-west was the subcontinent Beleriand, which was later engulfed by the ocean at the end of the First Age.\n\nTolkien prepared several maps of Middle-earth and of the regions of Middle-earth where his stories took place. \nSome were published in his lifetime, though some of the earliest maps were not published until after his death. \nThe main maps are those published in \"The Hobbit\", \"The Lord of the Rings\", \"The Silmarillion\", and \"Unfinished Tales\", and appear as foldouts or illustrations.\n\nThe definitive map of Middle-earth was published in \"The Lord of the Rings\". This iconic map incorporates all the chief locations of the main story, and also includes places from some of the background histories. This map was also published (with various additions and embellishment) as a stand-alone poster: \"A Map of Middle-Earth\".\n\nIt is important to note that this map does not cover all of Middle-earth, but only shows the north-west of the continent. This is made more explicit in the revised version published in \"Unfinished Tales\", which is titled 'The West of Middle-earth at the end of the Third Age'. Tolkien's sketch-maps of the whole world also confirm that Middle-earth is far vaster than the area depicted on the \"Lord of the Rings\" map. The part of the map designated as 'Rhûn' is in fact only the western edge of that vast region; similarly the area inscribed 'Far Harad' is merely the northern extremity of Middle-earth's vast southern region.\n\nThe Ered Luin (Blue Mountains) on the upper left of the map are essentially the same range that stands on the extreme left of the map of Beleriand that is published in \"The Silmarillion\".\n\nTolkien's maps focus on the regions of Middle-earth where the main stories are set. However in \"The Shaping of Middle-earth\", volume IV of \"The History of Middle-earth\", Christopher Tolkien published several remarkable maps which his father had created in the latter part of the 1930s. These depict the whole world of which Middle-earth was a part: both the original flat Earth and the subsequent round world, and they also show other continents besides Middle-earth. Karen Wynn Fonstad drew from these maps to develop detailed, but non-canonical, \"whole world maps\" reflecting a world consistent with the historical ages depicted in \"The Silmarillion\", \"The Hobbit\", and \"The Lord of the Rings\".\n\nThe first maps appearing in Tolkien's published works – those in \"The Hobbit\" – were drawn entirely by the author himself. The finished versions of maps appearing in later publications were drawn by Tolkien's son Christopher, based on the detailed base-maps that the author had developed; in the case of \"The Lord of the Rings\" Tolkien supervised the process.\n\nThe developmental base-maps were later published in the \"History of Middle-earth\" series. Tolkien's early conceptions of the map of Beleriand were published as \"The First \"Silmarillion\" Map\" in volume 4 (\"The Shaping of Middle-earth\") and \"The Second Map of Middle-earth west of the Blue Mountains\" (also known as \"The Second \"Silmarillion\" Map\") in volume 11 (\"The War of the Jewels).\" The author's first drafts of the map of Middle-earth in \"The Lord of the Rings\" were published as \"The First Map of \"The Lord of the Rings\"\" in volume 7 (\"The Treason of Isengard\"); subsequent versions were published as \"The Second Map (West)\" and \"The Second Map (East)\" in volume 8 (\"The War of the Ring\").\n\nThe Tolkien Estate maintains the position that the geographical layout of Middle-earth or any other places in the imaginary universe created by J.R.R. Tolkien was the intellectual property of J.R.R. Tolkien and subsequently is that of his heirs. The Tolkien Estate has therefore restricted the publishing of maps to those authorized by the Estate and legally pursues anyone who publishes any maps, including self-made works, on the Internet.\n\nIn Tolkien's conception, \"Arda\" (the Earth) was created specifically as \"the Habitation\" (\"Imbar\" or \"Ambar\") for the Children of Ilúvatar (Elves and Men). It is envisaged in a flat Earth cosmology, with the sun, moon and stars revolving around it. Tolkien's sketches show a disc-like face for the world which looked up to the stars. However, Tolkien's legendarium addresses the spherical Earth paradigm by depicting a catastrophic transition from a flat to a spherical world, in which Aman was removed \"from the circles of the world\".\n\nMiddle-earth or Endor originally conformed to a largely symmetrical scheme that was marred by Melkor. The various conflicts with Melkor (as well as by the action of the Valar on one occasion) resulted in the shapes of the lands being distorted.\n\nOriginally, Arda began as a single flat world and the Valar created two great lamps to illuminate it, Illuin and Ormal. The Vala Aulë forged vast towers, Helcar in the north of Middle-earth, and Ringil in the south. Illuin was set upon Helcar and Ormal upon Ringil. In the middle, where the light of the lamps mingled, the Valar dwelt at the island of Almaren in the midst of a Great Lake.\n\nWhen Melkor destroyed the Lamps of the Valar, two vast inland seas formed at their sites (the Sea of Helcar and Sea of Ringil), but Almaren and its lake were destroyed. Arda's two main oceans, Belegaer and the Eastern Sea, were also created in this primeval epoch.\n\nThe Valar left Middle-earth and went to the newly formed continent of Aman in the west, where they created their home called Valinor. To discourage Melkor from assailing Aman, they thrust the continent of Middle-earth to the east, thus widening Belegaer at its middle and raising five major mountain ranges in Middle-earth which adopted a relatively symmetrical distribution, namely the Blue, Red, Grey, Yellow Mountains and the Mountains of the Wind. This act, however, ruined the symmetry of the shape of the continents and their intervening seas.\n\nMany centuries after Valinor was established, Melkor raised the Misty Mountains to impede the progress of the Vala Oromë as he hunted Melkor's beasts during the period of darkness in Middle-earth prior to the awakening of the Elves.\n\nAdditional changes occurred when the Valar assaulted Utumno, some years after the Awakening of the Elves. The North-west of Middle-earth, notably the regions west of the Blue Mountains (named Beleriand) wherein Melkor met the Valar host, was \"much broken\". Belegaer, the sea between Middle-earth and Aman widened further, creating among other bays one which was the Bay of Balar, the confluence of Sirion. The highland of Dorthonion and the mountains about Hithlum were also a result of the battles.\n\nIn the central region of Middle-earth, a Great Gulf (of Belegaer) was formed (the precursor to the later Bay of Belfalas). To the far south, the Inland Sea of Ringil expanded greatly and separated the southernmost part of the continent from the mainland, in effect forming the Dark Land (Hyarmenor) and the Inner Sea, linking by straits the previously separated Belegaer and Eastern Sea.\n\nAs told in \"The Silmarillion\", most of the events of the First Age took place in the large Middle-earth region of Beleriand and its environs. Tolkien placed within the bounds of Beleriand the hidden Elven kingdoms of Doriath, ruled by King Thingol, and Gondolin, founded by Turgon. Also important was the fortress of Nargothrond, founded by the elf Finrod Felagund. In the Blue Mountains to the east were the great dwarf halls of Belegost and Nogrod. Beleriand was split into eastern and western sections by the great river Sirion. In East Beleriand was the river Gelion with its seven tributaries, which defined the Green-elf realm of Ossiriand. To the north of Beleriand lay the regions of Nevrast, Hithlum and Dor-lómin, and the Iron Mountains where Morgoth (Melkor) had his fortress of Angband. The violent struggles during the War of Wrath between the Host of the Valar and the armies of Melkor at the end of the First Age brought about the destruction of Angband, and changed the shape of Middle-earth so that most of Beleriand vanished under the sea.\n\nIn the First Age geographical changes also occurred in Aman, the continent to the west of Middle-earth. The Pelóri Mountains were raised, along with the Enchanted Isles, to make Valinor essentially impassable save by the fortified Calacirya.\n\nIn the Second and Third Ages, during which Tolkien set the events of the \"Akallabêth\", \"The Hobbit\", and \"The Lord of the Rings\", the Western regions of Middle-earth contained the lands of Eriador, Gondor, the Misty Mountains, and the vales of the great river Anduin. Eriador was bordered by the Ered Luin or Blue Mountains to the west, which bordered the sea and the Grey Havens, also called Mithlond. On the east of Eriador stood the Misty Mountains, which ran from the far north to Isengard, home of the wizard Saruman, in the south. The Misty Mountains contained the great Dwarf-halls of Khazad-dûm or Moria.\n\nWithin Eriador lay originally the kingdom of Arnor, founded by Men who had fled the destruction of Númenor. It later split into the kingdoms of Arthedain, Cardolan, and Rhudaur. These kingdoms too had long since passed into history by the time of \"The Lord of the Rings\". Eriador also contained the Shire, homeland of the Hobbits, and the nearby settlement of Bree. Rivendell or Imladris, the home of the Half-elven Elrond also lay in Eriador, close to the western side of the Misty Mountains.\n\nEast of the Misty Mountains lay the large region called Wilderland (Rhovanion) and the great river Anduin. On its western side, between Anduin and the Misty Mountains, lay the Elvish kingdom of Lothlórien, home of the elf Galadriel, and the forest of Fangorn, home of the Ents. To the east of the Anduin lay the great forest of Mirkwood, (formerly Greenwood), and further east again were the Lonely Mountain or Erebor (seized from the Dwarves by the dragon Smaug), the town of Dale, Dorwinion, and the Iron Hills. South and east of the Misty Mountains was the kingdom of Rohan, inhabited by the allies of Gondor, and further south the kingdom of Gondor, founded like Arnor by men who escaped the destruction of the island of Númenor. East of Gondor, and surrounded by high mountains was Mordor, home of Sauron in his fortress of Barad-dûr.\n\nSouth of Gondor lay the far lands of Harad and Khand, and the port of Umbar. In the far East of Middle-earth, beyond Rhovanion, was the Sea of Rhûn, on the eastern side of which dwelt the Easterling peoples. The inhabitants of all these farther lands were traditionally hostile to Gondor, and allied with Sauron at the time of \"The Lord of the Rings\".\n\nTolkien described the region in which the Hobbits lived as \"the North-West of the Old World, east of the Sea\", and the north-west of the Old World is essentially Europe (including Britain). However, as he noted in private letters, the geographies do not match, and he did not consciously make them match when he was writing (with the exception of a newly discovered annotated map, see below):\n\nAs for the shape of the world of the Third Age, I am afraid that was devised 'dramatically' rather than geologically, or paleontologically.\n\nI am historically minded. Middle-earth is not an imaginary world. The name is the modern form (appearing in the 13th century) of midden-erd>middel-erd, an ancient name for the \"oikoumene\", the abiding place of Men, the objectively real world, in use specifically opposed to imaginary worlds (as Fairyland) or unseen worlds (as Heaven or Hell). The theatre of my tale is this earth, the one in which we now live, but the historical period is imaginary. The essentials of that abiding place are all there (at any rate for inhabitants of N.W. Europe), so naturally it feels familiar, even if a little glorified by enchantment of distance in time.\n\n\"...if it were 'history', it would be difficult to fit the lands and events (or 'cultures') into such evidence as we possess, archaeological or geological, concerning the nearer or remoter part of what is now called Europe; though the Shire, for instance, is expressly stated to have been in this region...I hope the, evidently long but undefined gap* in time between the Fall of Barad-dûr and our Days is sufficient for 'literary credibility', even for readers acquainted with what is known as 'pre-history'. I have, I suppose, constructed an imaginary time, but kept my feet on my own mother-earth for place. I prefer that to the contemporary mode of seeking remote globes in 'space'. However curious, they are alien, and not loveable with the love of blood-kin...\n\nIn another letter, Tolkien made correspondences in latitude (not equations) between Europe and Middle-earth:\n\nThe action of the story takes place in the North-west of 'Middle-earth', equivalent in latitude to the coastlands of Europe and the north shores of the Mediterranean. ... If Hobbiton and Rivendell are taken (as intended) to be at about the latitude of Oxford, then Minas Tirith, 600 miles south, is at about the latitude of Florence. The Mouths of Anduin and the ancient city of Pelargir are at about the latitude of ancient Troy.\n\nHe did confirm, however, that the Shire, the land of his Hobbit heroes, was \"based on\" England:\n\n'The Shire' is based on rural England and not any other country in the world...\n\nIn the Prologue to \"The Lord of the Rings\", Tolkien writes: \"Those days, the Third Age of Middle-earth, are now long past, and the shape of all lands has been changed...\"\n\nThe Appendices make several references in both history and etymology of topics 'now' (in modern English languages) and 'then' (ancient languages);\nThe year no doubt was of the same length,¹ [\"the footnote here reads\": 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 46 seconds.] for long ago as those times are now reckoned in years and lives of men, they were not very remote according to the memory of the Earth.\n\nNodded to both in Appendices and \"The Silmarillion\" (with supporting information within the \"History of Middle-earth\" series) there are constellations and stars that correspond to the astronomy seen in the northern hemisphere of Earth, including references to the Sun, the Moon, Orion (and his belt), Ursa Major and other planets (described as \"stars\"; thus Carnil is \"Mars\").\n\nA map annotated by Tolkien, discovered in October 2015 in Pauline Baynes's collection, places Hobbiton on the same latitude as Oxford, but also corresponds Minas Tirith with Ravenna, Italy. The author also used Belgrade, Cyprus, and Jerusalem as other reference points. (This map is the source of locations on Baynes's poster map that aren't included on the maps printed in the books, such as Framsburg and Dorwinion.)\n\nIn \"The Silmarillion\" the history of Arda is divided into four great time periods, known as the Ainulindalë, the Years of the Lamps, the Years of the Trees (the Valian years) and the Years of the Sun. In Middle-earth recorded history did not begin until the First Age and the Awakening of the Elves during the Years of the Trees - the time prior to that is simply known as the Beginning of Days. During the First Age the awakening of Men coincided with the first rising of the Sun and the beginning of the Years of the Sun, which have lasted from the First Age, through the Second, Third and Fourth Ages to the present day.\n\nIn Tolkien's universe, God is called Eru Ilúvatar. Tolkien created a cosmogony in which the genesis of the world was musical: in the beginning, Ilúvatar created spirits named the Ainur and taught them to make music. After the Ainur had become proficient in their skills, Ilúvatar commanded them to make a great music based on a theme of his own design. The most powerful Ainu, Melkor (later called \"Morgoth\" or \"Dark Enemy\" by the Elves), disrupted the theme. In response, Ilúvatar introduced new themes that enhanced the music beyond the comprehension of the Ainur. The foundation of Tolkien's creation is that the movements of their song, and the conflict in themes between Melkor and Ilúvatar, laid the seeds of much of the history of the as-yet-unmade universe and the people who were to dwell therein.\n\nThen Ilúvatar stopped the music and revealed its meaning to the Ainur through a vision. Moved, many of the Ainur felt a compelling urge to experience its events directly. Ilúvatar therefore created Eä, the universe itself, and some of the Ainur went into the universe to share in its experience. But upon arriving in Eä, the Ainur found that it was shapeless because they had entered at the beginning of time. The Ainur undertook great labours in these unnamed \"ages of the stars\", in which they shaped the universe and filled it with many things far beyond the reach of Men.\n\nIn time, however, the Ainur formed Arda, the future abiding place of the Children of Ilúvatar: Elves and Men. Melkor and his followers entered Eä as well, and they set about ruining and undoing whatever the others did. The fifteen most powerful Ainur are called the Valar; Melkor was the most powerful, but Manwë was the leader. Each of the Valar was attracted to a particular aspect of the world that became the focus of their powers. Melkor was drawn to terrible extremes and violence — bitter cold, scorching heat, earthquakes, rendings, breakings, utter darkness, burning light etc. His power was so great that at first the Valar were unable to restrain him, until the Vala Tulkas entered Eä and tipped the balance. Driven out by Tulkas, Melkor brooded in the darkness at the outer reaches of Arda. The Valar settled in Arda to watch over it and help prepare it for the awakening of the Children.\n\nThe Years of the Lamps began shortly after the Valar finished their labours in shaping Arda. Arda began as a single flat world and the Valar created two great Lamps to illuminate it, Illuin and Ormal. Each Lamp was set on an enormous pillar in Middle-earth. In the middle, where the light of the Lamps mingled, the Valar dwelt on the island of Almaren. This period, known as the \"Spring of Arda\", was a time when the Valar had ordered the World as they wished and rested upon Almaren, and Melkor lurked beyond the Walls of Night. During this time animals first appeared, and forests started to grow. The Spring was interrupted when Melkor returned to Arda, and ended completely when he destroyed the Lamps of the Valar. Melkor's destruction of the two Lamps marked the end of the Years of the Lamps.\n\nThe Years of the Trees began after Melkor's destruction of the two Lamps, when the Valar left Middle-earth and retreated to the extreme western regions of Arda. There the Vala Yavanna made the Two Trees named Telperion and Laurelin to give light to their new homeland of Valinor in the land of Aman. The Trees illuminated Aman, leaving the rest of Arda (including Middle-earth) in darkness, illuminated only by the stars.\n\nThe First Age in Tolkien's history of Middle-earth began when the Elves awoke beside Lake Cuiviénen in the east of Endor (Middle-earth). The Elves were soon approached by the Valar, who requested that they leave Middle-earth and come to Aman to live beside them. Many of the Elves were persuaded to undertake the Great Journey westwards towards Aman, but not all of them completed the journey (see Sundering of the Elves). The Valar had imprisoned Melkor, but he appeared to repent and was released on parole. He sowed great discord among the Elves and stirred up rivalry between the Elven princes Fëanor and Fingolfin. He then slew their father, King Finwë, destroyed the Two Trees themselves with the aid of Ungoliant the spider, and stole the Silmarils, three extraordinarily precious gems crafted by Fëanor that contained light of the Two Trees, from their maker's vault.\n\nFëanor persuaded most of his people, the Noldor, to leave Aman in pursuit of Melkor to Beleriand in Middle-earth, cursing him with the name \"Morgoth\", 'Black Enemy'. He and his sons swore an oath to recover the Silmarils at any cost. Fëanor led the first of two groups of the Noldor. The second and larger group was led by Fingolfin. The Noldor stopped at the Teleri port-city, Alqualondë, but the Teleri refused to give them ships to get to Middle-earth. The first Kinslaying ensued when Fëanor and many of his followers attacked the Teleri and stole their ships. Fëanor's host sailed on the stolen ships, leaving Fingolfin's behind. The second group had little choice but to cross over to Middle-earth through the deadly Helcaraxë (or 'Grinding Ice') in the far north. Subsequently, Fëanor was slain, but most of his sons survived and founded realms, as did Fingolfin and his heirs. Meanwhile, the Valar took the last two living fruit of the Two Trees and used them to create the Moon and Sun, which remained a part of Arda, but were separate from Ambar (the earthly world).\n\nThe Years of the Sun began when the Valar made the Sun, and it rose over Ambar, and thereafter time in the First Age was counted from the date of its rising. After several great battles, a Long Peace ensued for four hundred years, during which time the first Men, the Edain, entered Beleriand by crossing over the Blue Mountains. When Morgoth broke the siege of Angband, one by one, the Elven kingdoms fell, even the hidden city of Gondolin. The only measurable success achieved by Elves and Men came when Beren of the Edain and Lúthien, daughter of Thingol and Melian, retrieved a Silmaril from the crown of Morgoth. Afterward, Beren and Lúthien died, and were restored to life by the Valar with the understanding that Lúthien was to become mortal and Beren should never be seen by Men again.\n\nThingol quarrelled with the Dwarves of Nogrod and they slew him, stealing the Silmaril. Beren waylaid the dwarves and recovered the Silmaril, which he gave to Lúthien. Soon afterwards, both Beren and Lúthien died again. The Silmaril was given to their son Dior Half-elven, who had restored the Kingdom of Doriath. The sons of Fëanor demanded that Dior surrender the Silmaril to them, and he refused. The Fëanorians destroyed Doriath and killed Dior in the second Kinslaying, but Dior's young daughter Elwing escaped with the jewel. Three sons of Fëanor—Celegorm, Curufin, and Caranthir—died trying to retake the jewel.\n\nBy the end of the age, all that remained of the free Elves and Men in Beleriand was a settlement at the mouth of the River Sirion. Among them was Eärendil, who married Elwing. But the Fëanorians again demanded the Silmaril be returned to them, and after their demand was rejected they resolved to take the jewel by force, leading to the third Kinslaying. Eärendil and Elwing took the Silmaril across the Great Sea, to beg the Valar for pardon and aid. The Valar responded. Melkor was captured, most of his works were destroyed, and he was banished beyond the confines of the world into the Door of Night.\n\nThe Silmarils were recovered at a terrible cost, as Beleriand itself was broken and began to sink under the sea. Fëanor's last remaining sons, Maedhros and Maglor, were ordered to return to Valinor. They proceeded to steal the Silmarils from the victorious Valar. But, as with Melkor, the Silmarils burned their hands and they then realized they were not meant to possess them, and that their oath was null. Each of the brothers met his fate: Maedhros threw himself with the Silmaril into a chasm of fire, and Maglor threw his Silmaril into the sea. Thus, one Silmaril ended in the sky, worn by Eärendil, a second in the earth, and the third in the sea.\n\nAt the beginning of the Second Age, the Edain were given the island of Númenor toward the west of the Great Sea as their home, while many Elves were welcomed into the West. The Númenóreans were blessed by the Valar with long life, three times that of lesser men. They became great seafarers, and, in their days of glory, came to Middle-earth to teach the lesser men great skills. However, the Númenóreans grew jealous of their immortal brethren, the Elves. At the height of their power, the Númenóreans ruled over the Men of Middle-earth, instead of helping them. After a few centuries, Sauron, Morgoth's most powerful servant and chief captain, began to organize evil creatures in the eastern lands. He persuaded Elven smiths in Eregion to create Rings of Power, and secretly forged the One Ring to control the other Rings. But the Elves became aware of Sauron's plan as soon as he put the One Ring on his hand, and they removed their own Rings before he could master their wills. During this time, the Shadow grew over Númenor, as kings no longer laid down their lives when they had lived to the fullest, but rather clung greedily to life. Númenor, ever thankful to Eru Ilúvatar and the Valar in the past, now neglected to pay tribute, growing ever more restless about the Doom of Man, the curse of mortality. The people of Númenor became divided between the King's Men, those who would see the power and dominion of Númenor grow and their gratitude towards the Elves and Valar wane, and the Faithful, who still maintained their ties with the Elves, and still paid heed to the words of Eru.\n\nWith his newfound might and growing dominion over Middle-earth, Sauron claimed that he was the King of Men. Ar-Pharazôn, the last king of Númenor, thinking that none but he should have this title, sailed to Middle-earth with an army to challenge Sauron's claim. Sauron, seeing the might of Númenor at its noontide, knew that he could not stand against them. So he allowed himself to be captured and taken back to Númenor as a hostage. Soon, Sauron's deceit and fair-seeming words won him favour with the King. He lied to the King, and told him that Melkor, Lord of Darkness, was the true God and that Eru was but an invention of the Valar. Thus began the persecution of the Faithful, who were sacrificed in the name of Melkor. Finally, as Ar-Pharazôn grew old, Sauron, using the power of the One Ring, told the King that none, not even the Valar of Valinor, could challenge the might of Númenor, and that the King should assail Valinor, and by setting foot on the Undying Lands, achieve immortality. Ar-Pharazôn, fearing death, assembled a massive fleet and set sail for the Undying Lands. Amandil, chief of those still faithful to the Valar, remembering the embassy of Eärendil, set sail to seek mercy from the Valar. To disguise his intent, he sailed first to the east, and then sailed west, but was never heard from again. His son Elendil and grandsons Isildur and Anárion kept the Faithful out of the coming war and made preparations to flee in nine ships.\n\nBefore the end of the Second Age, when the Men of Númenor rebelled against the Valar due to the deceits of Sauron, Ilúvatar destroyed Númenor, separated Valinor from the rest of Arda, and formed new lands, making the world round. When the King's forces landed on Aman, the Valar called for Ilúvatar to intervene. The world was changed, so that Aman was removed from Imbar. From that time onward, Men could no longer find Aman, but Elves seeking passage in specially hallowed ships received the grace of using the Straight Road, which led from Middle-earth's seas to the seas of Aman. The mighty fleet of Ar-Pharazôn and the land of Númenor, were utterly destroyed, and with it the fair body of Sauron; but his spirit endured and fled back to Middle-earth. Elendil and his sons also escaped to Middle-earth, and founded the realms of Gondor and Arnor.\n\nSauron soon rose again, but the Elves allied with the Men to form the Last Alliance and defeated him. In a siege that lasted years, Gil-galad, High King of the Elves; Elendil, the ruler of Gondor and Arnor; and Anárion, son of Elendil; were slain, as was Sauron's body. Elendil's other son Isildur finally cut the One Ring from Sauron's hand with his father's sword, diminishing Sauron's power and making his spirit flee once again, and thus achieving victory and peace for a time. But Isildur refused to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom, against all advice, and took it as a weregild for his father and brother. However, the Ring soon betrayed him when it abandoned him during an ambush of Orcs at the Gladden Fields; Isildur was slain and the Ring was lost in the Anduin for over two thousand years.\n\nThe Third Age saw the rise in power of the realms of Arnor and Gondor, and their decline. By the time of \"The Lord of the Rings\", Sauron had recovered much of his former strength, and was seeking the One Ring. He learned that it was in the possession of a Hobbit and sent out the nine Ringwraiths to retrieve it. The Ring-bearer, Frodo Baggins, travelled to Rivendell, where it was decided that the Ring had to be destroyed in the only way possible: casting it into the fires of Mount Doom. Frodo set out on the quest with eight companions—the Fellowship of the Ring. At the last moment, he failed, but with the intervention of the creature Gollum—who was saved by the pity of Frodo and Bilbo Baggins—the Ring was nevertheless destroyed. Frodo with his companion Sam Gamgee were hailed as heroes. Sauron was destroyed and his spirit forever dissipated.\n\nThe end of the Third Age marked the end of the dominion of the Elves and the beginning of the dominion of Men.\n\nAs the Fourth Age began, many of the Elves who had lingered in Middle-earth left for Valinor, never to return; those who remained behind would \"fade\" and diminish. The Dwarves returned in large numbers to Moria and resettled it, though they eventually dwindled away as well. Under King Elessar of Gondor (Aragorn of the Dúnedain), peace was restored between Gondor and the lands to the south and east.\n\nIn this age King Elessar bans humans from entering the Shire, allowing the Hobbits to live peaceful and unmolested lives. Elessar and Queen Arwen die at almost the same time, and the kingdom is passed to his son.\n\nTolkien started a story to be known as The New Shadow set several generations after King Elessar in which a new evil had arisen, men playing at orcs, and which the protagonist follows one of the cultists to learn more about them, before the thirty pages of the draft abruptly stops. Tolkien never finished the story, as he regarded it merely as a \"thriller\".\n\nThe Ainur were angelic beings created by Ilúvatar. The cosmological myth called the \"Ainulindalë\", or \"Music of the Ainur\", describes how the Ainur sang for Ilúvatar, who then created Eä to give material form to their music. Many of the Ainur entered Eä, and the greatest of these were called the Valar. Melkor, the chief agent of evil in Eä, and later called \"Morgoth\", was initially one of the Valar.\n\nWith the Valar came lesser spirits of the Ainur, called the Maiar. Melian, the wife of the Elven King Thingol in the First Age, was a Maia. There were also evil Maiar, called Umaiar, including the Balrogs and the second Dark Lord, Sauron. Sauron devised the Black Speech (Burzum) for his slaves (such as Orcs) to speak. In the Third Age, a number of the Maiar were embodied and sent to Middle-earth to help the free peoples to overthrow Sauron. These are the Istari (or \"Wise Ones\", called Wizards by Men), including Gandalf, Saruman, Radagast, Alatar and Pallando.\n\nThe Elves are known as the first born of Ilúvatar: intelligent beings created by Ilúvatar alone. There are many different clans of Elves, but the main distinction is between the Calaquendi or Light Elves and the Moriquendi or Dark Elves. Tolkien's work \"The Silmarillion\" tells of how the race of Elves awoke in Cuiviénen in eastern Middle-earth. The Valar came to Middle-earth soon afterwards, and invited the Elves to come and live with them in their home in Aman, the continent to the west of Middle-earth. Those elves who accepted and began the Great Journey to Aman from their birthplace of Cuiviénen were called the Eldar or the Middle-earth Eldar. The elves who completed the journey were sometimes called the Light Elves because they saw the magical Light of the Two Trees, the source of light in Aman. Those elves who refused the offer were called the Avari, and the Eldar who tired of the long journey west and remained behind in Middle-earth were called the Dark Elves because they would never see the Light of the Two Trees. Generally Dark Elves were considered less powerful than Light Elves, but the term 'Dark' did not imply they were in any way evil. In later years some of the Light Elves (chiefly the Noldor clan) returned to Middle-earth, mainly on a quest to retrieve precious jewels called the Silmarils, stolen from them by Morgoth.\n\nOriginally Elves all spoke the same Common Eldarin ancestral tongue, but after the long separation of thousands of years it diverged into different languages. The two main Elven languages were Quenya, spoken by the Light Elves, and Sindarin, spoken by the Sindar, the Dark Elves who stayed behind in Beleriand as mentioned above. Tolkien compared the use of Quenya in Middle-earth as like Latin, with Sindarin as the common speech. The Teleri of Valinor spoke Telerin, which was very close to Quenya but generally considered a distinct language and not a dialect.\n\nPhysically the Elves resemble humans almost identically; indeed, they are arguably the same species, as they can marry and have children (though this is extremely rare and the Half-elven are very famous as a result). However the Elves have a more ethereal and less visceral nature, and their bodies \"fade\" into their spirits, to the point that any Elves alive today would be totally ghostlike and invisible to most Humans.\n\nThe Elves are very agile and quick-footed. They are generally somewhat taller than Men. They are also extremely well coordinated, as is evident in \"The Fellowship of the Ring\", when the elves walk across the tightrope in the woods of Lothlórien. Their eyesight is hawk-like and they are also said to glow with light. Another example is when the Fellowship take the pass of Caradhras, where Legolas is able to walk across the deep snow without falling through. Though they can be killed, Elves are immortal, and when they reach maturity they appear to cease aging (though they do continue to physically age, just at a rate so slow as to be almost imperceptible, such as in Círdan's case). They are also re-embodied in Valinor if they are slain or die in an accident, and in the first and second ages, had the ability to return to Middle Earth exactly as they were previously, though they very seldom opted to do so. Their ears are pointed to a slight extent.\n\nIn Tolkien's writings the elves have been divided in several subgroups described in English as high elves, light-elves, fair-elves, deep elves, sea-elves, green-elves, wood-elves (sylvan elves), dark elves, grey-elves, and the special category half-elves. In the languages of the Elves there are additional subgroups under the above categories.\n\nMen were the second born of the Children of Ilúvatar, who awoke in Middle-earth much later than the Elves and (probably) also after the Dwarves. The capitalized term \"Man\" (plural \"Men\") is used as a gender-neutral racial description, to distinguish humans from the other human-like races of Middle-earth.\n\nIn appearance they are much like Elves, but on average less beautiful. Unlike Elves, Men are mortal, ageing and dying quickly, usually living 40–80 years. However the Númenóreans could live several centuries, and their descendants the Dúnedain also tended to live longer than regular humans. Nevertheless, except in a few 'purer' houses, this tendency was weakened both by time and by intermingling with 'lesser' peoples.\n\nThe Men involved in Tolkien's stories are mainly the Edain and their descendants. Originally the Edain were three tribes of Men who allied themselves with the Elves of Beleriand in the First Age. As a reward for their loyalty and suffering in the Wars of Beleriand, the Edain were given a new home on Númenor, a large island in the ocean far to the west of Middle-earth. Eventually, near the end of the Second Age, Númenor was destroyed, and a remnant of the Númenóreans established realms in the northern lands of Middle-earth. Those who remained faithful to the Valar founded the kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor. These Men were then known as the Dúnedain. Other Númenórean survivors, still devoted to evil but living far to the south, became known as the Black Númenóreans.\n\nThe languages spoken by Men include Adûnaic – spoken by the Númenóreans, Westron – The 'Common Speech' – represented by English, and Rohirric – spoken by the Rohirrim – represented in \"The Lord of the Rings\" by Old English.\n\nAt the end of the Third Age and the beginning of the Fourth, the King of Gondor is Aragorn. Other notable Men in \"The Lord of the Rings\" are Théoden, Éowyn, and Éomer of Rohan, and the brothers Boromir and Faramir of Gondor.\n\nBeorn appears in \"The Hobbit\" as a huge man with the ability to transform into a bear. Beorn often left home for days at a time to fight the enemies threatening the forest people. His origins lay in the distant past; Gandalf suspected that he and his people originally came from the mountains. Beorn is the ancestor of the Beornings, who live in the north at the end of the Third Age, allied with the Woodsmen of Mirkwood.\n\nThe Dwarves are a race of humanoids shorter than Men, and larger than Hobbits. They are mortal like Men, but live much longer, usually several hundred years. A peculiarity of Dwarves is that both males and females are bearded, and thus appear identical to outsiders. The language spoken by Dwarves is called Khuzdul, and was kept largely as a secret language for their own use. Like Men and Hobbits, Dwarves live exclusively in Middle-earth. They generally reside under mountains, where they are specialists in mining and metalwork.\n\nThe Dwarves are said to have been created by the Vala Aulë, who offered to destroy them when Ilúvatar confronted him. The seven Dwarf Fathers had no true life as created by Aulë, but were tied to his power. When Ilúvatar saw that Aulë had created the Dwarves in a desire to see Ilúvatar's vision fulfilled and not out of a desire for power or domination of Aulë's will, Ilúvatar brought true life to the seven Dwarf fathers. He forgave Aulë's transgression and adopted the Dwarves as his own. His only condition was that they were not allowed to awaken before the Elves. Therefore, the Dwarves' creator Aulë laid them to sleep in widely-separated hidden mountain locations in northern Middle-earth, and there they remained in suspended animation until after the had Elves awoken. These dwarves were known as the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves, who (along with their mates) went on to found the seven kindreds of Dwarves when they awoke.\n\nThe first dwarf to awake was Durin the father of the Longbeards, the oldest and wisest kindred of the Dwarves, and the main focus of Tolkien's stories. Durin founded the greatest Dwarf kingdom called Khazad-dûm, later known as Moria in the Misty Mountains. The Dwarves spread throughout northern Middle-earth and each kindred founded its own kingdom. Only two other of these kingdoms are mentioned by Tolkien, Nogrod and Belegost in the Blue Mountains. These were the home of the Firebeards and the Broadbeams, who were allies of the Elves of Beleriand against Morgoth in the First Age.\n\n\"The Silmarillion\" introduces the Petty-dwarves who were diminutive even by dwarvish standards. They had been exiled from several of the Dwarf houses. They were hunted by the elves, leading to their eventual extinction. They had other cultural differences including that they were more unsociable, and freely gave out their Khuzdul names to outsiders.\n\nOf the races, Dwarves are the most resistant to corruption and influence of Morgoth and later Sauron. The seven rings of Power of the dwarves did not turn them to evil, but it did amplify their greed and lust for gold. The Dwarves' resistance to corruption is perhaps explained by their origin as the creations of Aulë and not being created by or original children in Ilúvatar's vision. It is said that very few wilfully served the side of darkness. Of those who did very little was written. Of the seven houses few fought on either side during the Last Alliance at the end of the Second Age, and is known that none from the House of Durin ever fought on the side of evil.\n\nDuring the early parts of the Third Age (or at least in legends of the previous), it is known that in some places wicked dwarves had made alliances with Orcs. It is suggested by Tolkien in some of his notes that of the dwarves that turned to wickedness they most likely came from the Dwarves of the far eastern mansions (and perhaps some of the nearer ones) came under the Shadow of Morgoth and turned to evil. It is however unclear if these refer to Dwarves beyond Iron Hills (the most eastern known stronghold of the Dwarves). Because Dwarves are not evil by nature, few ever served the Enemy of their own free will (though rumors of Men suggest the total was greater).\n\nTolkien identified Hobbits as an offshoot of the race of Men. Another name for Hobbit is 'Halfling', as they were generally only half the size of Men (Men in those times usually grew to six feet (ca. 180 cm) in height, and a Hobbit would be only three or four feet (ca. 90–120 cm) tall). In their lifestyle and habits they closely resemble Men, except for their preference for living in holes underground.\n\nAlthough their origins and ancient history are not known, Tolkien implied that they settled in the Vales of Anduin early in the Third Age, but after a thousand years the Hobbits began migrating west over the Misty Mountains into Eriador. Eventually, many Hobbits settled in the Shire and in nearby Bree. Tolkien says that there were three kinds of Hobbit: the Stoors, Fallohides and Harfoots.\n\nThe hobbits who appear most prominently in Tolkien's stories are Bilbo Baggins and his nephew Frodo Baggins, who each have an important role in the quest to destroy the One Ring of Power forged by Sauron; another is Sméagol, who took the One Ring after it was found in the Anduin. Frodo is told by Gandalf that Sméagol was part of a Hobbit-like riverfolk, but long possession of the ring corrupted and deformed him into the creature Gollum.\n\nBy the time of \"The Lord of the Rings\" Hobbits had long spoken the Mannish tongue Westron, though their dialect of Westron indicates that they formerly spoke a language akin to that of the Men of Rohan.\n\nThe Ents were shepherds of trees. They were created by Ilúvatar at the request of Yavanna, to protect trees from the depredations of Elves, Dwarves, and Men. When the Elves first awoke, they \"desired to converse with all things\", and taught the Ents to speak. The Ents developed their own peculiar \"Entish\" language, which was impossible for other races to learn due to its long descriptive phrases for even the smallest things. Nevertheless, the Ents could learn other races' languages and were able to communicate with others that way. Huorns were intermediate in form between Ents and trees: Ents that were \"falling asleep\" or trees that were becoming wildly active; they bore a deep antagonism toward orcs. By the time of \"The Lord of the Rings\" the Ents were a dwindling race, as the Entwives had left the Ents and disappeared. In \"The Lord of the Rings\", the Ents, led by Treebeard, the oldest Ent, were instrumental in defeating Saruman by destroying his fortress of Isengard, and the Huorns destroyed his army of orcs.\n\nOrcs and Trolls were evil creatures bred by Morgoth. They were not original creations but rather \"mockeries\" of the Children of Ilúvatar and Ents, since only Ilúvatar has the ability to give conscious life to things. The precise origins of Orcs and Trolls are unclear, as Tolkien considered various possibilities and sometimes changed his mind, leaving several inconsistent accounts. \"The Hobbit\" speaks of Goblins and Hobgoblins, and a note at the beginning of most editions explains that \"orc\" and \"goblin\" are synonymous, while \"hobgoblin\" refers to orcs of larger size. Late in the Third Age, the Uruks or Uruk-hai appeared: a race of Orcs of great size and strength that tolerate sunlight better than ordinary Orcs.\n\nTolkien also mentions \"Men-orcs\" and \"Orc-men\"; or \"half-orcs\" or \"goblin-men\". They share some characteristics with Orcs (like \"slanty eyes\") but are described as looking more like men. Some appear at the battle of Helm's Deep and in the \"Scouring of the Shire\", where it is recalled that similar-looking men were seen earlier causing trouble in Bree.\n\nTrolls were made from stone. The Ent Treebeard describes them in \"The Lord of the Rings\" as \"mockeries of Ents, they are stupid creatures, foul mouthed and brutal\". Daylight turned such \"stone trolls\" back into stone. In \"Roast Mutton\" in \"The Hobbit\", three trolls catch Bilbo and his Dwarf companions, and plan on eating them; but they are turned back to stone by the light of dawn before they get the chance. Tolkien also describes a race of trolls bred by Sauron called the 'Olog-hai' who were larger and stronger than ordinary trolls, and who could endure daylight. Other varieties mentioned include cave-trolls, hill-trolls, mountain-trolls (which dwarf all other troll kinds), and snow-trolls. In \"The Hobbit\", Gandalf alludes to trolls that have more than one head: \"I am afraid trolls do behave like that, even those with only one head each.\" Some soldiers from Far Harad are described as Half-trolls or troll-men.\n\nStone-giants appear in \"The Hobbit\" fighting one another in the valleys of the Misty Mountains. No further reference is made to them in any other of Tolkien's writings. In \"The Hobbit\", Bilbo remembers stories of giants and ogres, and thinks of them when trying to solve one of Gollum's riddles. Giants are mentioned in passing throughout \"The Lord of the Rings\", sometimes in poetic passages. Frodo mistakes the Argonath for giants before seeing that they are just statues, and both Helm's Deep and Minas Tirith were reputedly built by giants.\n\nMewlips are legendary creatures mentioned in \"The Adventures of Tom Bombadil\". They said to live in a fortress beyond Merlock Mountains and the Marsh of Tode (though it is not clear if these are actual places). They capture their victims and drag them down into the fortress to feast upon.\n\nSapient animals also appear in Middle-earth, such as the Eagles, Huan the Great Hound from Valinor and the wolf-like Wargs. The Eagles were created by Ilúvatar along with the Ents, and the Wargs were possibly descendants of earlier werewolves, but in general the origins and nature of these animals are unclear. Giant spiders such as Shelob descended from Ungoliant, of unknown origin. Other sapient species include the Crebain, evil crows who become spies for Saruman, and the Ravens, who brought news to the Dwarves. Vampires are mentioned briefly in \"The Silmarillion\" (possibly equivalent to large bats who aided the Goblins and Wargs in \"The Hobbit\"). The horse-line of the Mearas of Rohan also appear to be intelligent and understand human speech. Beorn had a number of animal friends about his house. The Badger-folk are introduced in \"The Adventures of Tom Bombadil\". They are said to live between the Barrow-downs and the Old Forest. In one story they capture Tom Bombadil. In another poem Bombadil speaks with several local animals: Little Bird, the willow-wren; Fisher Blue, a kingfisher, Whisker-lad of the Otter-folk, and Old Swan of Elvet-isle.\n\nIn \"The Two Towers\", when Gandalf returns, he mentions nameless things that dwelt along the path he followed deep under the earth, creatures who gnaw at the roots of the world.\n\nDragons (or \"worms\") appear in several varieties, distinguished by whether they have wings and whether they breathe fire (cold-drakes versus fire-drakes). The first of the fire-drakes (\"Urulóki\" in Quenya) was Glaurung the Golden, bred by Morgoth in Angband, and called \"The Great Worm\", \"The Worm of Morgoth\", and \"The Father of Dragons\". Glaurung played a decisive part in the battles of Morgoth against the Elves in the First Age, and directed the defeat of Nargothrond, but was eventually slain by Túrin. Winged dragons first appeared in the Great Battle at the end of the First Age, led by Ancalagon the Black, the mightiest of that host. In that battle he was slain by Eärendil. Gandalf avers, however, that even the fire of Ancalagon was not sufficiently hot to destroy Sauron's One Ring.\n\nIn the Third Age lived Scatha the Worm, \"the great dragon of the Ered Mithrin\" or Grey Mountains, He owned a large hoard of dwarf-treasure, but was killed by Fram of the Éothéod in the North not long after the dwarves were driven from Moria. The dwarves demanded their treasure back, but Fram gave them only a necklace made of Scatha's teeth. Subsequently, many dwarves settled in the Grey Mountains; but dragons multiplied there, and a great cold-drake killed Dain I (whereupon his heir Thrór, grandfather of Thorin Oakenshield, returned to re-establish the Kingdom under the Mountain at Erebor). After nearly two centuries, that kingdom was destroyed by Smaug, a flying fire-drake, who was later killed by Bard the Bowman in \"The Hobbit\". \"The Hobbit\" also refers in passing to \"Were-worms in the Last Desert\" (in the \"East of East\"), and to stone dragons.\n\nTurtle-fish are a race of giant sea-turtles mentioned in \"The Adventures of Tom Bombadil\". Fastitocalon, the last of the Turtle-fish, emulates an island, waiting for people to land on his back. Then he turns over, sending them to their deaths in the sea.\n\n\"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" are presented as Tolkien's retelling of events depicted in the Red Book of Westmarch, which was written by Bilbo Baggins, Frodo Baggins, and other Hobbits, and corrected and annotated by one or more Gondorian scholars. Tolkien wrote extensively about the linguistics, mythology and history of the world, which provide back-story for these stories. Many of these writings were edited and published posthumously by his son Christopher.\n\nAmong them is \"The Silmarillion\", which provides a creation story and description of the cosmology that includes Middle-earth. \"The Silmarillion\" is the primary source of information about Valinor, Númenor, and other lands. The \"Unfinished Tales\" and the multiple volumes of \"The History of Middle-earth\" include many incomplete stories and essays as well as numerous drafts of Tolkien's Middle-earth mythology, from the earliest forms down through the last writings of his life.\n\n\nTolkien died in 1973. All his further works connected to Middle-earth were edited by his son Christopher Tolkien and published posthumously. Only \"The Silmarillion\", \"Bilbo's Last Song\" and \"The Children of Húrin\" are presented as finished work — the others are collections of notes and draft versions.\n\n\n\n\nIn a letter to his son Christopher Tolkien, J. R. R. Tolkien set out his policy regarding film adaptations of his works: \"Art or Cash\". He sold the film rights for \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" to United Artists in 1969 after being faced with a sudden tax bill. They are currently in the hands of Middle-earth Enterprises, formerly known as Tolkien Enterprises. The Tolkien Estate retains the film rights to \"The Silmarillion\" and other works.\n\nThe first adaptation to be shown was \"The Hobbit\" in 1977, made by Rankin-Bass studios. This was initially shown on United States television.\n\nThe following year (1978), a movie entitled \"The Lord of the Rings\" was released, produced and directed by Ralph Bakshi; it was an adaptation of the first half of the story, using rotoscope animation. Although the film was relatively faithful to the story and a commercial success, its critical response (from critics, readers and non-readers alike) was mixed.\n\nIn 1980, Rankin-Bass produced a TV special covering roughly the last half of \"The Lord of the Rings\", called \"The Return of the King\". However, this did not follow on directly from the end of the Bakshi film.\n\nPlans for a live-action version of \"The Lord of the Rings\" would wait until the late 1990s to be realized. These were directed by Peter Jackson and funded by New Line Cinema, and produced in New Zealand with backing from the government and banking system.\n\nThe trilogy was a box office and critical success. The three films won seventeen Oscars altogether (at least one in each applicable category for a fictional, English language, live-action feature film, except in the acting categories).\n\nThe Hobbit (film series), a live-action adaptation of \"The Hobbit\", was made as a prequel to \"The Lord of the Rings\" film trilogy, produced in New Zealand under the direction of Peter Jackson. Although Tolkien's novel \"The Hobbit\" is a single book, unlike \"The Lord of the Rings\", \"The Hobbit\" film series is a trilogy like \"The Lord of the Rings\" film series. The films were released in December 2012, December 2013, and December 2014.\n\nThe works of Tolkien have been a major influence on role-playing games along with others such as Robert E. Howard, Fritz Leiber, H. P. Lovecraft, and Michael Moorcock. Although the most famous game to be inspired partially by the setting was Dungeons & Dragons, there have been two specifically Middle-earth based and licensed games. These are the Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game from Decipher Inc. and the Middle-earth Role Playing game (MERP) and Middle Earth the Wizards CCG from Iron Crown Enterprises.\n\nA \"Middle-Earth Play-By-Mail\" game was originally created in 1990 by Game Systems, Inc. under license by Tolkien Enterprises and is still produced. This play-by-email game was inducted into the Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts & Design's Hall of Fame in 1997.\n\nSimulations Publications created three war games based on Tolkien's work. \"War of the Ring\" covered most of the events in \"The Lord of the Rings\". \"Gondor\" focused on the battle of Pelennor Fields, and \"Sauron\" covered the Second Age battle before the gates of Mordor. The three games above were then released together as the \"Middle Earth\" game trilogy. Iron Crown Enterprises published \"The Fellowship of the Ring\". A board game also called \"War of the Ring\" has been published by Fantasy Flight Games.\n\nEA Games has released games based on the Jackson movies for the gaming consoles and the PC. These include the platformers \"The Two Towers\", \"The Return of the King\", the real-time strategy game \"\", its sequel \"\" and its expansion \"The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-King\"—which puts you in control of the warriors of Angmar, the home of the Witch-king, and the role-playing game \"\".\nAlso recently, Pandemic Studios, famous creators of the worked with EA to create , a game with a similar system to Battlefront. The game has mixed reviews but overall was successfully accepted. \"Traveller's Tales\" games developed \"Lego The Hobbit\" and before that \"Lego The Lord of the Rings\". The games were based on the films, but their worlds and characters were almost entirely made of LEGO bricks.\n\nBook-based games (officially licensed from Tolkien Enterprises) include Vivendi's own platformer, \"\", and Sierra's own real-time strategy game, \"\", and the many games based on \"The Hobbit\".\n\nTo add on to that, some games take place in between Tolkien's two major works (The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings), such as \"\". In this game players take on the role of Talion, a slain Ranger of Gondor, trapped between life and death. He is aided by the wraith of Celebrimbor. Together they must sow chaos throughout the armies and servants of the second Dark Lord, Sauron.\n\nTurbine (now a subsidiary of Warner Bros.) released the first Middle-earth-based graphical massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG): \"\" in April 2007. Since then, there have been five major expansions of the game, each adding large portions of the Middle-earth landscape.\n\nAside from officially licensed games, many Tolkien-inspired mods, custom maps and total conversions have been made for many games, such as \"Warcraft III\", \"Minecraft\", \"\", \"\", \"\" and \"\".\n\nMoreover, the Middle-Earth DEM Project seeks to create a highly detailed model of middle earth by using various middle-earth maps to map every feasible aspect of the fictional world such as rivers, vegetation and buildings for their dataset compiled for the Outerra game engine.\n\nIn addition, there are many text-based MMORPGs (known as MU*s) based on Tolkien's Middle-earth. The oldest of these dates back to 1991, and was known as Middle-Earth MUD, run by using LPMUD. After Middle-Earth MUD ended in 1992, it was followed by Elendor and MUME (Multi Users in Middle-earth).\n\nClimatologists from the University of Bristol actually simulated what the weather would be like in author J.R.R. Tolkien's fictional world of Middle-earth from \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy. Richard Pancost, one of the scientists who worked on the climate model, pointed out in a press release: \"Because climate models are based on fundamental scientific processes, they are able not only to simulate the climate of the modern Earth, but can also be easily adapted to simulate any planet, real or imagined, so long as the underlying continental positions and heights, and ocean depths are known.\"\n\nThere are allusions to concepts similar to, or identical to Middle-earth, in other works by Tolkien, and the work of other writers. The earliest of these in modern English is the poem \"The Gray Magician\" (1918) by Margaret Widdemer:\n\nAnother example is C. S. Lewis's \"Space Trilogy,\" in which Earth is also called Middle-earth. Lewis's novels are situated at the approximate time of World War II, with the last novel, \"That Hideous Strength,\" taking place in post-war England, and they specifically bring in references to Tolkien's legendarium (at that time largely unpublished) and treats these references as primary fact within Lewis's fiction. Merlin, of King Arthur fame, is treated as a successor to the Atlantis magic found within \"Numinor\" (Lewis's unintentional misspelling of Númenor), and similarities can also be found in the Quenya name for Númenor, which is \"Atalantë,\" and Lewis specifically references the earth as Middle-earth twice, both in Chapter 13, \"They Have Pulled Down Deep Heaven on Their Heads\". Lewis's borrowings came directly from Tolkien himself: they were close friends and shared each other's literary creations. Lewis encouraged Tolkien to persevere with his Middle-earth writings.\n\n\nA small selection from the many books about Tolkien and his created world:\n\n\n"}

The museum building is also known as the Old Ashmolean Building to distinguish it from the newer Ashmolean Museum building completed in 1894. The museum was built in 1683, and it is the world's oldest surviving purpose-built museum.\n\nThe museum is open to the general public every afternoon except Mondays, with free admission.\n\nBuilt in 1683 to house Elias Ashmole's collection, it was the world's first purpose-built museum building and was also open to the public. The original concept of the museum was to institutionalize the new learning about nature that appeared in the 17th century and experiments concerning natural philosophy were undertaken in a chemical laboratory in the basement, while lectures and demonstration took place in the School of Natural History, on the middle floor. Ashmole's collection was expanded to include a broad range of activities associated with the history of natural knowledge and in 1924 the gift of Lewis Evans' collection allowed the museum further improvement, becoming the \"Museum of the History of Science\" and appointing Robert Gunther as its first curator.\n\nThe collection and the building itself now occupies a special position in the study of the history of science and in the development of western culture and collecting.\nOne of the most iconic objects in the collection is Einstein's Blackboard that Albert Einstein used on 16 May 1931 in his lectures while visiting the University of Oxford, rescued by dons including and E. J. Bowen and Gavin de Beer.\n\nThe current collection contains around 18,000 objects from antiquity to the early 20th century, representing almost all aspects of the history of science and is used for both academic study and enjoyment by the visiting public.\nThe museum contains a wide range of scientific instruments, such as quadrants, astrolabes (the most complete collection in the world with c.170 instruments), sundials, early mathematical instruments (used for calculating, astronomy, navigation, surveying and drawing), optical instruments (microscopes, telescopes and cameras), equipment associated with chemistry, natural philosophy and medicine, and a reference library regarding the history of scientific instruments that includes manuscripts, incunabula, prints and printed ephemera, and early photographic items.\n\nThe museum shows the development of mechanical clocks. Lantern clocks and longcase clocks are exhibited in the Beeson Room, named after the antiquarian horologist Cyril Beeson (1889–1975) who gave his collection to the museum. Early turret clocks are exhibited above the stairs from the basement to the raised ground floor.\n\nFrom October 2009 until February 2010, the Museum hosted the first major exhibition of Steampunk art objects, curated by Art Donovan and presented by Dr Jim Bennett, then the museum director.\n\nThe museum is also home to the Rochester Avionic Archive, which includes a collection of avionics that originated with the Elliot Brothers, but also includes pieces from Marconi and BAE Systems.\n\nThe following have been Curator or Secretary to the Committee or Director at the museum:\n\n\n\n"}

(film)\n\nOh, God! is a 1977 American comedy film starring George Burns and John Denver. Based on a novel of the same name by Avery Corman, the film was directed by Carl Reiner from a screenplay written by Larry Gelbart. The story centers on unassuming supermarket manager Jerry Landers (Denver), chosen by God (Burns) to spread his message despite the skepticism of the media, religious authorities, and Landers' own wife (Teri Garr).\n\nThe film inspired two sequels, \"Oh, God! Book II\" (1980) and \"Oh, God! You Devil\" (1984), both of which featured Burns reprising his role, but with no other recurring characters from the original story.\n\nGod (George Burns) appears as a kindly old man to Jerry Landers (John Denver), an assistant supermarket manager. After a few failed attempts in trying to set up an \"interview,\" God tells Jerry that he has been selected to be His messenger to the modern world, much like a contemporary Moses. Timidly at first, Landers tells his wife (Teri Garr), children and a religion editor of the \"Los Angeles Times\" of his encounters with God and soon becomes a national icon of comedic fodder.\n\nJerry soon appears on television with Dinah Shore and describes the look God takes when he encounters him. The next day, after Jerry is stranded from a car breakdown, God appears as a taxi driver to take Jerry home, where they are met by a bunch of chanting \"religious nuts.\" Before he disappears, God consoles Jerry that he has the \"strength that comes from knowing.\"\n\nSkeptical at first, Landers finds his life turned upside down as a group of theologians attempt to discredit him by challenging him to answer a series of written questions in Aramaic while locked in a hotel room alone to prove God is contacting him directly. To Jerry's relief after an agonizing wait, God, working as room service, delivers food to Jerry and answers the questions. After being sued for slander by a charismatic preacher that God directed Jerry to call a \"phony,\" Jerry decides to prove his story in a court of law.\n\nJerry argues that if God's existence is a reasonable possibility, then He can materialize and sit in the witness chair if He so chooses. At first, God fails to appear and the judge threatens to charge Jerry with contempt for \"what you apparently thought was a clever stunt.\" Jerry argues that when everyone waited for a moment to see what would happen when he raised the mere possibility of God making a personal appearance in the courtroom, that proved that He at least deserves the , although given that a plaintiff in an American civil lawsuit needs only prove his/her case by a preponderance of the evidence in order to win, the mere establishment of reasonable doubt (including merely establishing that a given doubt is reasonable) is not enough to guarantee a defense verdict.\n\nSuddenly, without opening the doors, God appears and asks to be sworn in, concluding the procedure with \"So help me Me.\" \"If it pleases the court, and even if it doesn't please the court, I'm God, your honor.\"\n\nGod provides some miracles, first in the form of a few rather impressive card tricks for the judge. Then, to help the people believe, he leaves the stand, walks a few steps and, with everyone watching, literally disappears before their eyes. His disembodied voice then issues a parting shot: \"It can work. If you find it hard to believe in Me, maybe it will help to know that I believe in you.\"\n\nSometime later, after hearing the ringing of a public telephone, Jerry meets up with God once again. God states he's going on a trip to spend some time with animals. Jerry expresses worry that they failed, but God compares him to Johnny Appleseed, saying he was given the best seeds and they'll take root. Jerry then says he has lost his job and that everybody thinks he's a nut, but God assures him that there are other supermarkets and that he's in \"good company.\" God had said to Jerry earlier: \"lose a job; save a world.\" God gets ready to leave and says that he will not be coming back. Jerry then asks what if he needs to talk with him. God says to him \"I'll tell you what, you talk. I'll listen.\" He then disappears. Jerry smiles as God departs.\n\n\"Oh, God!\" garnered both critical acclaim and box office success upon its release.\n\nThe film was released on October 7, 1977 in 198 theaters and earned $1.9 million on its opening weekend. It ultimately grossed $51,061,196 domestically, making it the sixth highest-grossing film of 1977.\n\nThe film was well received by critics and was regarded by many as one of the best films of 1977, including Gene Siskel, who placed it on his top 10 list for the year. Roger Ebert gave the film 3.5 stars out of possible 4, praising the casting of Burns and Denver and noting that \"Oh God!\" struck the right tone by avoiding both pious religious platitudes and \"cheap shots\" about faith.\n\nThe film holds a 71% \"Fresh\" rating on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nLarry Gelbart's screenplay received an Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay and a Saturn Award nod for Best Writing. The screenplay also won the Writers Guild award for Best Comedy Adapted from Another Medium.\n\n\"Oh, God!\" was also awarded two Saturn Awards for Best Fantasy Film and Best Actor for George Burns. It received an additional nomination for Carl Reiner's direction.\n\n"}

{"id": "23940", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23940", "title": "Proto-Human language", "text": "Proto-Human language\n\nThe Proto-Human language (also Proto-Sapiens, Proto-World) is the hypothetical direct genetic predecessor of the world's languages.\n\nThe concept is purely speculative and not amenable to analysis in historical linguistics. It presupposes a monogenetic origin of language, i.e. the derivation of all natural languages from a single origin, presumably at some point of the Middle Paleolithic. As the predecessor of all \"extant\" languages, it would not necessarily be ancestral to a hypothetical Neanderthal language.\n\nThere is no generally accepted term for this concept. Most treatments of the subject do not include a name for the language under consideration (e.g. Bengtson and Ruhlen 1994). The terms \"Proto-World\" and \"Proto-Human\" are in occasional use. Merritt Ruhlen has been using the term \"Proto-Sapiens\".\n\nThe first serious scientific attempt to establish the reality of monogenesis was that of Alfredo Trombetti, in his book \"L'unità d'origine del linguaggio\", published in 1905 (cf. Ruhlen 1994:263). Trombetti estimated that the common ancestor of existing languages had been spoken between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago (1922:315).\n\nMonogenesis was dismissed by many linguists in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when the doctrine of the polygenesis of the human races and their languages was widely popular (e.g. Saussure 1986/1916:190).\n\nThe best-known supporter of monogenesis in America in the mid-20th century was Morris Swadesh (cf. Ruhlen 1994:215). He pioneered two important methods for investigating deep relationships between languages, lexicostatistics and glottochronology.\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, Joseph Greenberg produced a series of large-scale classifications of the world's languages. These were and are controversial but widely discussed. Although Greenberg did not produce an explicit argument for monogenesis, all of his classification work was geared toward this end. As he stated (1987:337): \"The ultimate goal is a comprehensive classification of what is very likely a single language family.\"\n\nNotable American advocates of linguistic monogenesis include Merritt Ruhlen, John Bengtson, and Harold Fleming.\n\nThe first concrete attempt to estimate the date of the hypothetical ancestor language was that of Alfredo Trombetti (1922:315), who concluded it was spoken between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago, or close to the first emergence of \"Homo sapiens\".\n\nIt is uncertain or disputed whether the earliest members of \"Homo sapiens\" had fully developed language. Some scholars link the emergence of language proper (out of a proto-linguistic stage that may have lasted considerably longer) to the development of behavioral modernity towards the end of the Middle Paleolithic or at the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic, roughly 50,000 years ago. \nThus, in the opinion of Richard Klein, the ability to produce complex speech only developed some 50,000 years ago (with the appearance of modern humans or Cro-Magnons).\nJohanna Nichols (1998) argued that vocal languages must have begun diversifying in our species at least 100,000 years ago.\nIn a 2012 study, an estimate on the time of the first emergence of human language was based on \nphonemic diversity. This is based on the assumption that phonemic diversity evolves much more slowly than grammar or vocabulary, slowly increasing over time (but reduced among small founding populations).\nAfrican languages today have some of the largest phonemic inventories in the world, while the smallest inventories are found in South America and Oceania, some of the last regions of the globe to be colonized.\nThe authors used data from the colonization of Southeast Asia to estimate the rate of increase in phonemic diversity.\nApplying this rate to African languages, they arrived at an estimated age of 350,000 to 150,000 years ago, compatible with the emergence and early dispersal of \"H. sapiens\".\nThe validity of this approach has been criticized as flawed.\n\nSpeculation as to \"characteristics\" of Proto-World is limited to linguistic typology, i.e. the identification of universal features shared by all human languages, such as grammar (in the sense of \"fixed or preferred sequences of linguistic elements\"), and recursion (\"clauses [or phrases] embedded in other clauses [or phrases]\"), but that beyond this nothing can be known of it (Campbell and Poser 2008:391).\n\nChristopher Ehret has hypothesized that Proto-Human had a very complex consonant system, including clicks.\n\nA few linguists, such as Merritt Ruhlen, have suggested the application of mass comparison and internal reconstruction (cf. Babaev 2008). A number of linguists have attempted to reconstruct the language, while many others reject this as fringe science.\n\nAccording to Murray Gell-Mann and Merritt Ruhlen (2011), the ancestral language would have had a basic order of Subject (S) - Object (O) - Verb (V) or SOV.\n\nRuhlen tentatively traces a number of words back to the ancestral language, based on the occurrence of similar sound-and-meaning forms in languages across the globe. Bengtson and Ruhlen (1994) identify 27 \"global etymologies\". The following table, adapted from Ruhlen (1994b), lists a selection of these forms:\n\nBased on these correspondences, Ruhlen (1994b:105) lists these roots for the ancestor language:\n\n\nIn a 2011 paper, Murray Gell-Mann and Merritt Ruhlen argued that the ancestral language had subject–object–verb (SOV) word order. The reason for thinking so is that in the world's natural language families, it is typical for the original language to have an SOV word order, and languages that evolve from it sometimes deviate. Their proposal develops an earlier one made by Talmy Givón (1979:271–309).\n\nLanguages with SOV word order have a strong tendency to have other word orders in common, such as:\n\n\nFor example, instead of saying \"The man goes to the wide river\", as in English, Ruhlen's Proto-Human speakers would have said \"Man wide river to goes\". However, half of all current languages have SOV order, and historically languages cycle between word orders, so finding evidence of this order in the reconstructions of many families may reflect no more than this general tendency, rather than reflecting a common ancestral form.\n\nMany linguists reject the methods used to determine these forms. Several areas of criticism are raised with the methods Ruhlen and Gell-Mann employ. The essential basis of these criticisms is that the words being compared do not show common ancestry; the reasons for this vary. One is onomatopoeia: for example, the suggested root for 'smell' listed above, *\"čuna\", may simply be a result of many languages employing an onomatopoeic word that sounds like sniffing, snuffling, or smelling. Another is the taboo quality of certain words. Lyle Campbell points out that many established proto-languages do not contain an equivalent word for *\"putV\" 'vulva' because of how often such taboo words are replaced in the lexicon, and notes that it \"strains credibility to imagine\" that a proto-World form of such a word would survive in many languages.\n\nUsing the criteria that Bengtson and Ruhlen employ to find cognates to their proposed roots, Lyle Campbell finds seven possible matches to their root for woman *\"kuna\" in Spanish, including \"cónyuge\" 'wife, spouse', \"chica\" 'girl', and \"cana\" 'old woman (adjective)'. He then goes on to show how what Bengtson and Ruhlen would identify as reflexes of *\"kuna\" cannot possibly be related to a proto-World word for woman. \"Cónyuge\", for example, comes from the Latin root meaning 'to join', so its origin had nothing to do with the word 'woman'; \"chica\" is a feminine adjective coming from a Latin noun meaning 'worthless object'; \"cana\" comes from the Latin word for 'white', and again shows a history unrelated to the word 'woman' (Campbell and Poser 2008:370–372). Campbell's assertion is that these types of problems are endemic to the methods used by Ruhlen and others.\n\nThere are some linguists who question the very possibility of tracing language elements so far back into the past. Campbell notes that given the time elapsed since the origin of human language, every word from that time would have been replaced or changed beyond recognition in all languages today. Campbell harshly criticizes efforts to reconstruct a Proto-human language, saying \"the search for global etymologies is at best a hopeless waste of time, at worst an embarrassment to linguistics as a discipline, unfortunately confusing and misleading to those who might look to linguistics for understanding in this area.\" (Campbell and Poser 2008:393)\n\n\n\n"}

The rebenque was used also for fighting, as a weapon by itself, when the fight did not merit a knife, or with the strap rolled on his left hand and the handle hanging, as a secondary weapon to the knife in his right hand. \n\nOf course, it was also used for domestic punishments, and for quasi-judicial chastisement (corporal punishments were outlawed in Argentina, at least in the books, from 1813 on, but the country was very large, sparsely populated and not totally under government control, not unlike the American West). A couple of lashes with the rebenque on the bare legs were widely used as a punishment for children, even in the urban areas.\n\nAs an equestrian culture, not only the poor gauchos used the rebenque, and there were (and still are) elaborate versions, with silver knobs and ferrules for the ranch owners (estancieros) and prominent citizens, the cost of the \n\nBesides the common rebenque described above, there were several other types.\n"}

Pavel in his 1986 book, \"Fictional Worlds\". The concept refers to the referential relationship of a text to a fictional world, the ontology of which can be established by a possible worlds approach. A large text that refers to a small fictional world is said to have low referential density, whereas a small text referring to a large fictional world has high referential density. The size of the text is measured in abstract terms as amplitude, which in most cases will correspond to its physical length; exceptions to this may arise in cases of embedded discourses, such as metanarratives (or imaging digressions), which refer to the actual world. For this reason, the form and genre of a fictional work provide only an approximate indication of its size; by the same token, it is possible to refer to the size and referential density of part of a fictional work. The size of a fictional world, in turn, is measured in terms of the sum total of properties applicable to the objects and agents inhabiting the fictional world.\n\nRelative (referential) density builds upon the abstract definition of referential density by including context sensitive factors such as the degree of external information the reader has to import to his reconstruction of the fictional world, the text’s narrative crowding, the ratio between action and description, and the epistemic paths chosen by the text. These factors will usually have more impact on the number of references in a text than its amplitude.\n\nReferential density and relative (referential) density account for much of what makes fictional texts 'thick' or 'easy' reads. All other factors being equal, high density will make for difficult reading in that the reader is required to reconstruct the fictional world in a short space, whereas low density is characteristic of a high degree of action. An author may, however, focus on psychology and thereby have a static plot with low density. On the other hand, certain authors and genres make the reader's reconstruction of the fictional world the very point of the text's enjoyment, which is the case with most works of science-fiction, fantasy, and historical fiction.\n"}

{"id": "73161", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73161", "title": "Seigniorage", "text": "Seigniorage\n\nSeigniorage , also spelled seignorage or seigneurage (from Old French \"seigneuriage\" \"right of the lord (\"seigneur\") to mint money\"), is the difference between the value of money and the cost to produce and distribute it. The term can be applied in the following ways:\n\n\nThe term also applies to monetary seignorage, where sovereign-issued securities are exchanged for newly minted bank notes by a central bank, thus allowing the sovereign to 'borrow' without needing to repay. However, monetary seignorage refers to the sovereign revenue obtained through routine debt monetization, including expanding the money supply during GDP growth and meeting yearly inflation targets.\n\nSeigniorage is a convenient source of revenue for some governments. By providing the government with increased purchasing power at the expense of the public's purchasing power, it imposes what is metaphorically known as an inflation tax on the public.\n\nA person has one ounce of gold, trades it for a government-issued gold certificate (providing for redemption in one ounce of gold), keeps that certificate for a year, and then redeems it in gold. That person ends up with exactly one ounce of gold again. No seigniorage occurs.\n\nInstead of issuing gold certificates, a government converts gold into currency at the market rate by printing paper notes. A person exchanges one ounce of gold for its value in currency. This person keeps the currency for one year, and then exchanges it all for an amount of gold at the new market value. If the value of the currency relative to gold has changed during the interim this second exchange may yield more or less than one ounce of gold. (Assume that the value or direct purchasing power of one ounce of gold remains constant through the year.)\n\nIf the value of the currency relative to gold has decreased, then the person receives less than one ounce of gold. Seigniorage occurred.\n\nIf the value of the currency relative to gold has increased, then the person receives more than one ounce of gold. Seigniorage did not occur.\n\nSeigniorage, therefore, is the positive return on issuing notes and coins, or \"carry\" on money in circulation.\n\nThe opposite, \"cost of carry (demurrage)\", is not regarded as a form of seigniorage.\n\nOrdinarily seigniorage is only an interest-free loan (for instance of gold) to the issuer of the coin or paper money. When the currency is worn out, the issuer buys it back at face value, thereby balancing exactly the revenue received when it was put into circulation, without any additional amount for the interest value of what the issuer received.\n\nHistorically, seigniorage was the profit resulting from producing coins. Silver and gold were mixed with base metals to make durable coins. Thus the British \"sterling\" was 92.5% pure silver; the base metal added (and thus the pure silver retained by the government mint) was (less costs) the profit, the seigniorage. United States gold coins before 1933 were made from 90% gold and 10% copper. To make up for the lack of gold the coins are over-weighted. A one-ounce Gold American Eagle will have as much of the alloy as is needed to contain a total of one ounce of gold which will be over one ounce. Seigniorage is earned by selling the coins above the melt value in exchange for guaranteeing the weight of the coin.\n\nCurrently, under the rules governing monetary operations of major central banks (including the central bank of the United States), seigniorage on bank notes is simply defined as the interest payments received by central banks on the total amount of currency issued. This usually takes the form of interest payments on treasury bonds purchased by central banks, putting more dollars into circulation. However, if the currency is collected, or is otherwise taken permanently out of circulation, the back end of the deal never occurs (that is, the currency is never returned to the central bank). Thus the issuer of the currency keeps the whole seigniorage profit, by not having to buy worn out issued currency back at face value.\n\nThe solvency constraint of the standard central bank only requires that the present discounted value of its net non-monetary liabilities (separate from its monetary liabilities accrued through seigniorage attempts) be zero or negative in the long run. Its monetary liabilities are liabilities only in name, as they are irredeemable: the holder of base money cannot insist at any time on the redemption of a given amount of base money into anything else other than the same amount of itself (base money)—unless, of course, the holder of said base money is another central bank reclaiming the value of its original interest-free loan.\n\nEconomists regard seigniorage as a form of inflation tax, redistributing real resources to the currency issuer. Issuing new currency, rather than collecting taxes paid out of the existing money stock, is then considered in effect a tax that falls on those who hold the existing currency. Inflation of the money supply in the long run may cause—and, all other things being equal, will cause—a general rise in prices due to the reduced purchasing power of the currency.\n\nThis is one reason offered in support of free banking, a gold or silver standard, or at a minimum the reduction of political control over central banks. The latter could then take as their primary objective ensuring a stable value of currency by controlling monetary expansion and thus limiting inflation. Independence from government is required to reach this aim – indeed, it is well known in economic literature that governments face a conflict of interest in this regard. In fact, \"hard money\" advocates argue that central banks have utterly failed to obtain the objective of a stable currency. Under the gold standard, for example, the price level in both England and the US remained relatively stable over hundreds of years, though with some protracted periods of deflation. Since the US Federal Reserve was formed in 1913, however, the US dollar has fallen to barely a twentieth of its former value through the consistently inflationary policies of the bank. Economists counter that deflation is hard to control once it sets in and its effects are much more damaging than modest, consistent inflation.\n\nBanks or governments relying heavily on seigniorage and fractional reserve sources of revenue can find it counterproductive. Rational expectations of inflation take into account a bank's seigniorage strategy, and inflationary expectations can maintain high inflation. Instead of accruing seigniorage from fiat money and credit, most governments opt to raise revenue primarily through formal taxation and other means.\n\nIn the book \"Inflation Tax: The Plan To Deal With The Debts\", there are suggested to be a number of ways in which governments gain benefits directly or indirectly from inflation i.e.\n\nIt has been argued that inflation has been used by successive governments since 1945 as a tool to manage their debts.\n\nThe \"50 State\" series of quarters (25-cent coins) was launched in the U.S. in 1999. The U.S. government planned on a large number of people collecting each new quarter as it rolled out of the U.S. Mint, thus taking the pieces out of circulation. Each set of quarters is worth $14.00 (a complete set includes quarters for all fifty states, the five U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia). Since it costs the Mint about five cents for each 25-cent piece it produces, the government made a profit whenever someone \"bought\" a coin. The U.S. Treasury estimates that it has earned about US$6.3 billion in seigniorage from the quarters over the course of the entire program.\n\nIn some cases, national mints report the amount of seigniorage provided to their respective governments; for example, the Royal Canadian Mint reported that in 2006 it generated $C93 million in seigniorage for the Government of Canada. The U.S. government, the largest beneficiary of seignorage, earned approximately $25 billion annually as of 2000. For coinage only, seigniorage accruing to the U.S. Treasury per dollar issued for the fiscal year 2011 was 45 cents.\n\nOccasionally, central banks have introduced limited quantities of higher-valued banknotes in unusual denominations, with the intention of these notes being collected. The denomination chosen will usually coincide with an anniversary of national significance. However, the potential seigniorage that can be earned from such printings has proven to be limited, since the unusual denomination makes the notes more difficult to circulate and only a relatively small number of people are willing to collect higher-valued notes.\n\nAccording to some reports, over half of Zimbabwe governmental revenue in 2008 was seigniorage. Zimbabwe has experienced hyperinflation (see \"Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe\"), with the annualized rate at about 24,000% in July 2008 (prices doubling every 46 days).\n\nA very profitable type of seignorage is from the international circulation of banknotes. While the cost of printing banknotes is minimal, the foreign entity must provide goods and services at the face value of the note to obtain it. The banknote is retained because the entity values it as a \"store of value\" because of mistrust of the local currency.\n\nOverseas circulation is intimately tied in with large value banknotes. One purpose of using foreign currency is for store of value, but another is efficiency of private transactions, some of which are illegal.\n\nAmerican currency has been circulating globally for most of the 20th century. Certainly in World War II, the amount of currency in circulation was increased several fold. However, the modern era of huge printings of the United States one hundred-dollar bill started with the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. Production was quadrupled with the first ever trillion dollar printing of this bill. As of the end of 2008, U.S. currency in circulation with the public amounted to $824 billion and 76% of the currency supply was in the form of $100 denomination banknotes, amounting to twenty $100 bills per U.S. citizen. Over the past decade there has been considerable controversy concerning the amount of U.S. currency circulating abroad. Porter and Judson have claimed that in the mid nineties between 53 and 67 percent of U.S. currency was overseas, whereas Feige’s estimates suggested a figure closer to 40 percent abroad. Most recently, Goldberg writing in a New York Federal Reserve publication asserted that “about 65 percent ($580 billion) of all banknotes are in circulation outside of the country. However, these assertions are contradicted by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors Flow of Funds statistics which show that at the end of March 2009, only $313 billion (36.7 percent) of U.S. currency was held abroad. Feige calculates that since 1964, \"the cumulative seigniorage earnings accruing to the U.S. by virtue of the currency held by foreigners amounted to $167–$185 billion and over the past two decades seigniorage revenues from foreigners have averaged $6–$7 billion dollars per year\".\n\nThe American $100 bill has some competition, primarily from the €500 note. The larger value of the banknote makes it easier to transport larger amounts of money. As an example, $1 million in currency in $100 bills weighs 22 pounds, if, say, you were to carry it on board an airplane. It is difficult to carry this much money without a briefcase and some physical security. The same amount in €500 notes would weigh less than three pounds, and it could probably be dispersed in clothing and in luggage without attracting attention or alerting a security device. For many illegal operations, the problem of transporting currency is more difficult than transporting cocaine because of the size and weight of the currency. The ease of transporting banknotes makes the euro very attractive to Latin American drug cartels.\n\nThe Swiss 1000 franc note is probably the only other banknote that is in circulation outside of its home country. It is worth slightly more than US$1000. However, to the non-Swiss it doesn't provide a significant advantage over the €500 note as there are 20 times as many of the €500 note circulating and they are more widely recognized. As a reserve currency it is roughly 0.1% of the currency composition of official foreign exchange reserves.\n\nGovernments differ radically in their issuance of large banknotes. As of August 2009, the number of 1000 Swiss franc notes circulating was over three times the population of Switzerland. In comparison, the number of £50 banknotes circulating is slightly less than three times the population of the United Kingdom. But the 1000 franc note is worth roughly £600. The British government has traditionally been wary of large banknotes since the counterfeiting Operation Bernhard in World War II which caused the Bank of England to withdraw all notes larger than £5 from circulation, and not reintroduce other denominations until the early 1960s (£10), 1970 (£20) and March 20, 1981 (£50).\n\nThe American treasury considered re-issuing a US$500 banknote when the euro banknotes began circulating. There was concern that the high value banknotes would provide competition. However, after recognition that the $500 banknote would provide a huge advantage to worldwide criminal operations and dictatorships, the decision was made not to pursue this option.\n\n"}

In addition to temperature change, the shape change of SMPs can also be triggered by an electric or magnetic field, light or solution. As well as polymers in general, SMPs also cover a wide property-range from stable to biodegradable, from soft to hard, and from elastic to rigid, depending on the structural units that constitute the SMP. SMPs include thermoplastic and thermoset (covalently cross-linked) polymeric materials. SMPs are known to be able to store up to three different shapes in memory. SMPs have demonstrated recoverable strains of above 800%.\n\nTwo important quantities that are used to describe shape-memory effects are the strain recovery rate (\"R\") and strain fixity rate (\"R\"). The strain recovery rate describes the ability of the material to memorize its permanent shape, while the strain fixity rate describes the ability of switching segments to fix the mechanical deformation.\n\nwhere \"N\" is the cycle number, \"ε\" is the maximum strain imposed on the material, and \"ε(N)\" and \"ε(N-1)\" are the strains of the sample in two successive cycles in the stress-free state before yield stress is applied.\n\nShape-memory effect can be described briefly as the following mathematical model:\n\nwhere \"E\" is the glassy modulus, \"E\" is the rubbery modulus, \"f\" is viscous flow strain and \"f\" is strain for \"t » t\".\n\nWhile most traditional shape-memory polymers can only hold a permanent and temporary shape, recent technological advances have allowed the introduction of triple-shape-memory materials. Much as a traditional double-shape-memory polymer will change from a temporary shape back to a permanent shape at a particular temperature, triple-shape-memory polymers will switch from one temporary shape to another at the first transition temperature, and then back to the permanent shape at another, higher activation temperature. This is usually achieved by combining two double-shape-memory polymers with different glass transition temperatures or when heating a programmed shape-memory polymer first above the glass transition temperature and then above the melting transition temperature of the switching segment.\n\nPolymers exhibiting a shape-memory effect have both a visible, current (temporary) form and a stored (permanent) form. Once the latter has been manufactured by conventional methods, the material is changed into another, temporary form by processing through heating, deformation, and finally, cooling. The polymer maintains this temporary shape until the shape change into the permanent form is activated by a predetermined external stimulus. The secret behind these materials lies in their molecular network structure, which contains at least two separate phases. The phase showing the highest thermal transition, \"T\", is the temperature that must be exceeded to establish the physical crosslinks responsible for the permanent shape. The switching segments, on the other hand, are the segments with the ability to soften past a certain transition temperature (\"T\") and are responsible for the temporary shape. In some cases this is the glass transition temperature (\"T\") and others the melting temperature (\"T\"). Exceeding \"T\" (while remaining below \"T\") activates the switching by softening these switching segments and thereby allowing the material to resume its original (permanent) form. Below \"T\", flexibility of the segments is at least partly limited. If \"T\" is chosen for programming the SMP, strain-induced crystallization of the switching segment can be initiated when it is stretched above \"T\" and subsequently cooled below \"T\". These crystallites form covalent netpoints which prevent the polymer from reforming its usual coiled structure. The hard to soft segment ratio is often between 5/95 and 95/5, but ideally this ratio is between 20/80 and 80/20. The shape-memory polymers are effectively viscoelastic and many models and analysis methods exist.\n\nIn the amorphous state, polymer chains assume a completely random distribution within the matrix. W represents the probability of a strongly coiled conformation, which is the conformation with maximum entropy, and is the most likely state for an amorphous linear polymer chain. This relationship is represented mathematically by Boltzmann's entropy formula \"S\" = \"k\" ln \"W\", where \"S\" is the entropy and \"k\" is Boltzmann's constant.\n\nIn the transition from the glassy state to a rubber-elastic state by thermal activation, the rotations around segment bonds become increasingly unimpeded. This allows chains to assume other possibly, energetically equivalent conformations with a small amount of disentangling. As a result, the majority of SMPs will form compact, random coils because this conformation is entropically favored over a stretched conformation.\n\nPolymers in this elastic state with number average molecular weight greater than 20,000 stretch in the direction of an applied external force. If the force is applied for a short time, the entanglement of polymer chains with their neighbors will prevent large movement of the chain and the sample recovers its original conformation upon removal of the force. If the force is applied for a longer period of time, however, a relaxation process takes place whereby a plastic, irreversible deformation of the sample takes place due to the slipping and disentangling of the polymer chains.\n\nTo prevent the slipping and flow of polymer chains, cross-linking can be used, both chemical and physical.\n\nRepresentative shape-memory polymers in this category are polyurethanes, polyurethanes with ionic or mesogenic components made by prepolymer method. Other block copolymers also show the shape-memory effect, such as, block copolymer of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyethyleneoxide (PEO), block copolymers containing polystyrene and poly(1,4-butadiene), and an ABA triblock copolymer made from poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline) and polytetrahydrofuran.\n\nA linear, amorphous polynorbornene (Norsorex, developed by CdF Chemie/Nippon Zeon) or organic-inorganic hybrid polymers consisting of polynorbornene units that are partially substituted by polyhedral oligosilsesquioxane (POSS) also have shape-memory effect.\n\nThe main limitation of physically crosslinked polymers for the shape-memory application is irreversible deformation during memory programming due to the creep. The network polymer can be synthesized by either polymerization with multifunctional (3 or more) crosslinker or by subsequent crosslinking of a linear or branched polymer. They form insoluble materials which swell in certain solvents.\n\nThis material can be made by using excess diisocyanate or by using a crosslinker such as glycerin, trimethylol propane. Introduction of covalent crosslinking improves in creep, increase in recovery temperature and recovery window.\n\nThe PEO-PET block copolymers can be crosslinked by using maleic anhydride, glycerin or dimethyl 5-isophthalates as a crosslinking agent. The addition of 1.5 wt% maleic anhydride increased in shape recovery from 35% to 65% and tensile strength from 3 to 5 MPa.\n\nWhile shape-memory effects are traditionally limited to thermosetting plastics, some thermoplastic polymers, most notably PEEK, can be used as well.\n\nLight-activated shape-memory polymers (LASMP) use processes of photo-crosslinking and photo-cleaving to change \"T\". Photo-crosslinking is achieved by using one wavelength of light, while a second wavelength of light reversibly cleaves the photo-crosslinked bonds. The effect achieved is that the material may be reversibly switched between an elastomer and a rigid polymer. Light does not change the temperature, only the cross-linking density within the material. For example, it has been reported that polymers containing cinnamic groups can be fixed into predetermined shapes by UV light illumination (> 260 nm) and then recover their original shape when exposed to UV light of a different wavelength (< 260 nm). Examples of photoresponsive switches include cinnamic acid and cinnamylidene acetic acid.\n\nThe use of electricity to activate the shape-memory effect of polymers is desirable for applications where it would not be possible to use heat and is another active area of research. Some current efforts use conducting SMP composites with carbon nanotubes, short carbon fibers (SCFs), carbon black, or metallic Ni powder. These conducting SMPs are produced by chemically surface-modifying multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) in a mixed solvent of nitric acid and sulfuric acid, with the purpose of improving the interfacial bonding between the polymers and the conductive fillers. The shape-memory effect in these types of SMPs have been shown to be dependent on the filler content and the degree of surface modification of the MWNTs, with the surface modified versions exhibiting good energy conversion efficiency and improved mechanical properties.\n\nAnother technique being investigated involves the use of surface-modified super-paramagnetic nanoparticles. When introduced into the polymer matrix, remote actuation of shape transitions is possible. An example of this involves the use of oligo (e-caprolactone)dimethacrylate/butyl acrylate composite with between 2 and 12% magnetite nanoparticles. Nickel and hybrid fibers have also been used with some degree of success.\n\nShape-memory polymers differ from shape memory alloys (SMAs) by their glass transition or melting transition from a hard to a soft phase which is responsible for the shape-memory effect. In shape-memory alloys martensitic/austenitic transitions are responsible for the shape-memory effect. \nThere are numerous advantages that make SMPs more attractive than shape memory alloys. They have a high capacity for elastic deformation (up to 200% in most cases), much lower cost, lower density, a broad range of application temperatures which can be tailored, easy processing, potential biocompatibility and biodegradability, and probably exhibit superior mechanical properties than SMAs.\n\nOne of the first conceived industrial applications was in robotics where shape-memory (SM) foams were used to provide initial soft pretension in gripping. These SM foams could be subsequently hardened by cooling making a shape adaptive grip. Since this time the materials have seen widespread usage in e.g. the building industry (foam which expands with warmth to seal window frames), sports wear (helmets, judo and karate suits) and in some cases with thermochromic additives for ease of thermal profile observation. Polyurethane SMPs are also applied as an autochoke element for engines.\n\nOne fascinating field in which SMPs are impacting quite significantly nowadays is photonics. Due to the shape changing capability, SMPs enable the production of functional and responsive photonic gratings. In fact, by using modern soft lithography techniques such as replica molding, it is possible to imprint periodic nanostructures, with sizes of the order of magnitude of visible light, onto the surface of shape memory polymeric blocks. As a result of the refractive index periodicity, these systems diffract light. By taking advantage of the polymer’s shape memory effect, it is possible to reprogram the lattice parameter of the structure and consequently tune its diffractive behavior.\nAnother application example of SMPs in photonics is in shape changing random lasers. By doping SMPs with highly scattering particles such as titania ones it is possible to tune the light transport properties of the composite. Additionally, optical gain may be introduced by adding a molecular dye to the material. By configuring both the amount of scatters and of the organic dye, a light amplification regime may be observed when the composites are optically pumped. Shape memory polymers have been also been used in conjunction with Nanocellulose to fabricate composites exhibiting both chiroptical properties and thermo-activated shape memory effect. \n\nMost medical applications of SMP have yet to be developed, but devices with SMP are now beginning to hit the market. Recently, this technology has expanded to applications in orthopedic surgery.\nAdditionally, SMPs are now being used in various ophthalmic devices including punctal plugs, glaucoma shunts and introacular lenses.\n\nSMPs are smart materials with potential applications as, e.g., intravenous cannula, self-adjusting orthodontic wires and selectively pliable tools for small scale surgical procedures where currently metal-based shape-memory alloys such as Nitinol are widely used. Another application of SMP in the medical field could be its use in implants: for example minimally invasive, through small incisions or natural orifices, implantation of a device in its small temporary shape. Shape-memory technologies have shown great promise for cardiovascular stents, since they allow a small stent to be inserted along a vein or artery and then expanded to prop it open. After activating the shape memory by temperature increase or mechanical stress, it would assume its permanent shape. Certain classes of shape-memory polymers possess an additional property: biodegradability. This offers the option to develop temporary implants. In the case of biodegradable polymers, after the implant has fulfilled its intended use, e.g. healing/tissue regeneration has occurred, the material degrades into substances which can be eliminated by the body. Thus full functionality would be restored without the necessity for a second surgery to remove the implant. Examples of this development are vascular stents and surgical sutures. When used in surgical sutures, the shape-memory property of SMPs enables wound closure with self-adjusting optimal tension, which avoids tissue damage due to overtightened sutures and does support healing and regeneration.\n\nFurther potential applications include self-repairing structural components, such as e.g. automobile fenders in which dents are repaired by application of temperature. After an undesired deformation, such as a dent in the fender, these materials \"remember\" their original shape. Heating them activates their \"memory.\" In the example of the dent, the fender could be repaired with a heat source, such as a hair-dryer. The impact results in a temporary form, which changes back to the original form upon heating—in effect, the plastic repairs itself. SMPs may also be useful in the production of aircraft which would morph during flight. Currently, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA is testing wings which would change shape by 150%.\n\nThe realization of a better control over the switching behavior of polymers is seen as key factor to implement new technical concepts. For instance, an accurate setting of the onset temperature of shape recovering can be exploited to tune the release temperature of information stored in a shape memory polymer. This may pave the way for the monitoring of temperature abuses of food or pharmaceuticals.\n\nRecently, a new manufacturing process, Mnemosynation, was developed at Georgia Tech to enable mass production of crosslinked SMP devices, which would otherwise be cost-prohibitive using traditional thermoset polymerization techniques. Mnemosynation was named for the Greek goddess of memory, Mnemosyne and is the controlled imparting of memory on an amorphous thermoplastic materials utilizing radiation-induced covalent crosslinking, much like Vulcanization imparts recoverable elastomeric behavior on rubbers using sulfur crosslinks. Mnemosynation combines advances in ionizing radiation and tuning the mechanical properties of SMPs to enable traditional plastics processing (extrusion, blow molding, injection molding, resin transfer molding, etc.) and allows thermoset SMPs in complex geometries. The customizable mechanical properties of traditional SMPs are achievable with high throughput plastics processing techniques to enable mass producible plastic products with thermosetting shape-memory properties: low residual strains, tunable recoverable force and adjustable glass transition temperatures.\n\nShape memory polymers may serve as technology platform for a safe way of information storage and release. Multifunctional labels may even make counterfeiting increasingly difficult. Shape memory polymers have already been made into shape memory film by extruder machine, with covert and overt 3D embossed pattern internally, and 3D pattern will be released to be embossed or disappeared in just seconds irreversibly as soon as it is heated; Shape memory film can be used as label substrates or face stock for anti-counterfeiting, brand protection, tamper-evident seals, anti-pilferage seals, etc.\n\n"}

Scientific skepticism involves the application of skeptical philosophy, critical-thinking skills, and knowledge of science and its methods to empirical claims, while remaining agnostic or neutral to non-empirical claims (except those that directly impact the practice of science). The movement has the goal of investigating claims made on fringe topics and determining whether they are supported by empirical research and are reproducible, as part of a methodological norm pursuing \"the extension of certified knowledge\". The process followed is sometimes referred to as skeptical inquiry.\n\nRoots of the movement date at least from the 19th century, when people started publicly raising questions regarding the unquestioned acceptance of claims about spiritism, of various widely-held superstitions, and of pseudoscience.\nPublications such as those of the Dutch Vereniging tegen de Kwakzalverij (1881) also targeted medical quackery.\n\nUsing as a template the Belgian organization founded in 1949, Comité Para, Americans Paul Kurtz and Marcello Truzzi founded the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP), in Amherst, New York in 1976. Now known as the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI), this organization has inspired others to form similar groups worldwide.\n\nScientific skepticism or rational skepticism (also spelled scepticism), sometimes referred to as skeptical inquiry, is a practical, epistemological position in which one questions the veracity of claims lacking empirical evidence. In practice, the term is most commonly applied to the examination of claims and theories that appear to be beyond mainstream science, rather than to the routine discussions and challenges among scientists. Scientific skepticism is different from philosophical skepticism, which questions humans' ability to claim any knowledge about the nature of the world and how they perceive it. Methodological skepticism, a systematic process of being skeptical about (or doubting) the truth of one's beliefs, is similar but distinct. The \"New Skepticism\" described by Paul Kurtz is scientific skepticism. For example, Robert K. Merton asserts that all ideas must be tested and are subject to rigorous, structured community scrutiny (as described in Mertonian norms).\n\nAn important difference to classical skepticism, according to religious history professor Olav Hammer, is that it is not directly aligned with classical pyrrhonian scepticism, which would question all sort of orthodox wisdom, as well as the one established by modern science. According to Hammer, \"the intellectual forebears of the modern skeptical movement are rather to be found among the many writers throughout history who have argued against beliefs they did not share.\"\n\nThe following are quotations related to scientific skepticism:\n\nWith regard to the skeptical social movement, Loxton refers to other movements already promoting \"humanism, atheism, rationalism, science education and even critical thinking\" before. He saw the demand for the new movement—a movement of people called \"skeptics\" — being based on a lack of interest by the scientific community to address paranormal and fringe science claims. In line with Kendrick Frazier, he describes the movement as a surrogate in that area for institutional science. The movement set up a distinct field of study, and provided an organizational structure, while long-standing genre of individual skeptical activities lacked such a community and background. Skeptical organizations typically tend to have science education and promotion among their goals.\n\nScientific skeptics maintain that empirical investigation of reality leads to the truth, and that the scientific method is best suited to this purpose. Scientific skeptics attempt to evaluate claims based on verifiability and falsifiability and discourage accepting claims on faith or anecdotal evidence. Skeptics often focus their criticism on claims they consider to be implausible, dubious or clearly contradictory to generally accepted science. Scientific skeptics do not assert that unusual claims should be automatically rejected out of hand on \"a priori\" grounds—rather they argue that claims of paranormal or anomalous phenomena should be critically examined and that extraordinary claims would require extraordinary evidence in their favor before they could be accepted as having validity. From a scientific point of view, theories are judged on many criteria, such as falsifiability, Occam's Razor, Morgan's Canon and explanatory power, as well as the degree to which their predictions match experimental results. Skepticism in general may be deemed part of the scientific method; for instance an experimental result is not regarded as established until it can be shown to be repeatable independently.\n\nThe skeptic spectrum has been characterized as divided into \"wet\" and \"dry\" sceptics, primarily based on the level of engagement with those promoting claims that appear to be pseudoscience; the dry skeptics preferring to debunk and ridicule, in order to avoid giving attention and thus credence to the promoters, and the \"wet\" skeptics, preferring slower and more considered engagement, in order to avoid appearing sloppy and ill-considered and thus similar to the groups all skeptics opposed.\n\nRon Lindsay has argued that while some of the claims appear to be harmless or \"soft targets,\" it is important to continue to address them and the underlying habits of thought that lead to them so that we do not \"have a lot more people believing that 9/11 was an inside job, that climate change is a hoax, that our government is controlled by aliens, and so forth -- and those beliefs are far from harmless.\" \n\nThe movement has had issues with allegations of sexism. The disparity between women and men in the movement was raised in a 1985 skeptic newsletter by Mary Coulman. The skeptic movement has generally been made up of men; at a 1987 conference the members there discussed the fact that the attendees were predominantly older white men and a 1991 listing of 50 CSICOP fellows included four women. Following a 2011 conference, Rebecca Watson, a prominent skeptic, raised issues of the way female skeptics are targeted with online harassment including threats of sexual violence by opponents of the movement, and also raised issues of sexism within the movement itself. While she received some support in response to her discussion of sexism within the movement, she later became a target of virulent online harassment, even from fellow skeptics, after posting an online video that equated a man showing interest in her with misogyny. This became known as \"Elevatorgate\", based on Watson's discussion about being propositioned in a hotel elevator in the early morning after a skeptic event.\n\nThe term \"debunk\" is used to describe efforts by skeptics to expose or discredit claims believed to be false, exaggerated, or pretentious. It is closely associated with skeptical investigation or rational inquiry of controversial topics (compare list of topics characterized as pseudoscience) such as U.F.O.s, claimed paranormal phenomena, cryptids, conspiracy theories, alternative medicine, religion, or exploratory or fringe areas of scientific or pseudoscientific research.\n\nFurther topics that scientifically skeptical literature questions include health claims surrounding certain foods, procedures, and alternative medicines; the plausibility and existence of supernatural abilities (e.g. tarot reading) or entities (e.g. poltergeists, angels, gods—including Zeus); the monsters of cryptozoology (e.g. the Loch Ness monster); as well as creationism/intelligent design, dowsing, conspiracy theories, and other claims the skeptic sees as unlikely to be true on scientific grounds.\n\nSkeptics such as James Randi have become famous for debunking claims related to some of these. Paranormal investigator Joe Nickell cautions, however, that \"debunkers\" must be careful to engage paranormal claims seriously and without bias. He explains that open minded investigation is more likely to teach and change minds than debunking.\n\nA striking characteristic of the skeptical movement is the fact that while most of the phenomena covered, such as astrology and homeopathy, have been debunked again and again, they stay popular. Frazier reemphasized in 2018 that \"[w]e need independent, evidence-based, science-based critical investigation and inquiry now more than perhaps at any other time in our history.\" \n\nThe scientific skepticism community has traditionally been focused on what people believe rather than why they believe—there might be psychological, cognitive or instinctive reasons for belief when there is little evidence for such beliefs. According to Hammer, the bulk of the skeptical movement's literature works on an implicit model, that belief in the irrational is being based on scientific illiteracy or cognitive illusions. He points to the skeptical discussion about astrology: The skeptical notion of astrology as a \"failed hypothesis\" fails to address basic anthropological assumptions about astrology as a form of ritualized divination. While the anthropological approach attempts to explain the activities of astrologers and their clients, the skeptical movement's interest in the cultural aspects of such beliefs is muted.\n\nAccording to sociologist David J. Hess, the skeptical discourse tends to set science and the skeptical project apart from the social and the economic. From this perspective, he argues that skepticism takes on some aspects of a sacred discourse, as in Emile Durkheim's \"Elementary Forms of the Religious Life\"—Science, seen as pure and sacred (motivated by values of the mind and reason), is set apart from popular dealings with the paranormal, seen as profane (permeated by the economic and the social); obscuring the confrontation between science and religion. Hess states as well a strong tendency in othering: both skeptics and their opponents see the other as being driven by materialistic philosophy and material gain and assume themselves to have purer motives.\n\nWhile not all pseudoscientific beliefs are necessarily dangerous, some can potentially be harmful. Plato believed that to release others from ignorance despite their initial resistance is a great and noble thing. Modern skeptical writers address this question in a variety of ways. Bertrand Russell argued that some individual actions based on beliefs for which there is no evidence of efficacy, can result in destructive actions.\nJames Randi often writes on the issue of fraud by psychics and faith healers. Unqualified medical practice and alternative medicine can result in serious injury and death.Skeptical activist Tim Farley, who aims to create catalogue of harmful pseudoscientific practices and cases of damage caused by them, estimates documented number of killed or injured to be more than 600.000. Richard Dawkins points to religion as a source of violence (notably in \"The God Delusion\"), and considers creationism a threat to biology. Some skeptics, such as the members of The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe podcast, oppose certain new religious movements because of their cult-like behaviors.\n\nLeo Igwe, Junior Fellow at the Bayreuth International Graduate School of African Studies and past Research Fellow of the James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF), wrote \"A Manifesto for a Skeptical Africa\", which received endorsements from multiple public activists in Africa, as well as skeptical endorsers around the world. He is a Nigerian human rights advocate and campaigner against the impacts of child witchcraft accusations. Igwe came into conflict with high-profile witchcraft believers, leading to attacks on himself and his family.\n\nIn 2018, Amardeo Sarma provided some perspective on the state of the skeptical movement by addressing \"the essence of contemporary skepticism and [highlighting] the vital nonpartisan and science-based role of skeptics in preventing deception and harm.\" He emphasized the dangers of pseudoscience as a reason for prioritizing skeptical work.\n\nRichard Cameron Wilson, in an article in \"New Statesman\", wrote that \"the bogus sceptic is, in reality, a disguised dogmatist, made all the more dangerous for his success in appropriating the mantle of the unbiased and open-minded inquirer\". Some advocates of discredited intellectual positions (such as AIDS denial, Holocaust denial and climate change denial) engage in pseudoskeptical behavior when they characterize themselves as \"skeptics\". This is despite their cherry picking of evidence that conforms to a pre-existing belief. According to Wilson, who highlights the phenomenon in his 2008 book \"Don't Get Fooled Again\", the characteristic feature of false skepticism is that it \"centres not on an impartial search for the truth, but on the defence of a preconceived ideological position\".\n\nScientific skepticism is itself sometimes criticized on this ground. The term \"pseudoskepticism\" has found occasional use in controversial fields where opposition from scientific skeptics is strong. For example, in 1994, Susan Blackmore, a parapsychologist who became more skeptical and eventually became a Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP) fellow in 1991, described what she termed the \"worst kind of pseudoskepticism\":\n\nCommenting on the labels \"dogmatic\" and \"pathological\" that the \"Association for Skeptical Investigation\" puts on critics of paranormal investigations, Bob Carroll of the \"Skeptic's Dictionary\" argues that that association \"is a group of pseudo-skeptical paranormal investigators and supporters who do not appreciate criticism of paranormal studies by truly genuine skeptics and critical thinkers. The only skepticism this group promotes is skepticism of critics and [their] criticisms of paranormal studies.\"\n\nAccording to skeptic author Daniel Loxton, \"skepticism is a story without a beginning or an end.\" His article \"Why Is There a Skeptical Movement\" claims a history of two millennia of paranormal skepticism. He is of the opinion that the practice, problems, and central concepts extend all the way to antiquity and refers to a debunking tale as told in some versions of the Old Testament, where the Prophet Daniel exposes a tale of a \"living\" statue as a scam. According to Loxton, throughout history, there are further examples of individuals practicing critical inquiry and writing books or performing publicly against particular frauds and popular superstitions, including people like Lucian of Samosata (2nd century), Michel de Montaigne (16th century), Thomas Ady and Thomas Browne (17th century), Antoine Lavoisier and Benjamin Franklin (18th century), many different philosophers, scientists and magicians throughout the 19th and early 20th century up until and after Harry Houdini. However, skeptics banding together in societies that research the paranormal and fringe science is a modern phenomenon.\n\nDaniel Loxton mentions the Belgian Comité Para (1949) as the oldest \"broad mandate\" skeptical organization. Although it was preceded by the Dutch Vereniging tegen de Kwakzalverij (VtdK) (1881), which is therefore considered the oldest skeptical organization by others, the VtdK only focuses on fighting quackery, and thus has a 'narrow mandate'. The Comité Para was partly formed as a response to a predatory industry of bogus psychics who were exploiting the grieving relatives of people who had gone missing during the Second World War. In contrast, Michael Shermer traces the origins of the modern scientific skeptical movement to Martin Gardner's 1952 book \"Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science\".\n\nIn 1968, the French Association for Scientific Information (AFIS) was founded. AFIS strives to promote science against those who deny its cultural value, abuse it for criminal purposes or as a cover for quackery. According to AFIS, science itself cannot solve humanity's problems, nor can one solve them without using the scientific method. It maintains that people should be informed about scientific and technical advancements and the problems it helps to solve. Its magazine, \"Science et pseudo-sciences\", attempts to distribute scientific information in a language that everyone can understand.\n\nIn 1976, the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP), known as the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI) since November 2006, was founded in the United States. Some see this as the \"birth of modern skepticism\", however, founder Paul Kurtz actually modeled it after the Comité Para, including its name. Kurtz' motive was being \"dismayed ... by the rising tide of belief in the paranormal and the lack of adequate scientific examinations of these claims.\"\n\nKurtz was an atheist and had also founded the Committee for the Scientific Examination of Religion. While he saw both aspects as being covered in the skeptical movement, he had recommended CSICOP to focus on paranormal and pseudoscientific claims and to leave religious aspects to others. Despite not being the oldest, CSICOP was \"the first successful, broad-mandate North American skeptical organization of the contemporary period\", popularized the usage of the terms \"skeptic\", \"skeptical\" and \"skepticism\" by its magazine, \"Skeptical Inquirer\", and directly inspired the foundation of many other skeptical organizations throughout the world, especially in Europe.\n\nThese included Australian Skeptics (1980), Vetenskap och Folkbildning (Sweden, 1982), New Zealand Skeptics (1986), GWUP (Austria, Germany and Switzerland, 1987), Skepsis r.y. (Finland, 1987), Stichting Skepsis (Netherlands, 1987), CICAP (Italy, 1989) and SKEPP (Dutch-speaking Belgium, 1990).\n\nBesides scientists such as astronomers, stage magicians like James Randi were important in investigating charlatans and exposing their trickery. In 1996 Randi formed the James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF) and created the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge, where anyone who could demonstrate paranormal abilities, under mutually agreed-upon controlled circumstances, could claim the prize. After Randi's retirement in 2015, the Paranormal Challenge was officially terminated by the JREF with the prize unclaimed:\n\nOther influential second-generation American organizations were The Skeptics Society (founded in 1992 by Michael Shermer), the New England Skeptical Society (originating in 1996) and the Independent Investigations Group (formed in 2000 by James Underdown).\n\nAfter the Revolutions of 1989, Eastern Europe saw a surge in quackery and paranormal beliefs that were no longer restrained by the generally secular Communist regimes or the Iron curtain and its information barriers. The foundation of many new skeptical organizations was as well intending to protect consumers. These included the Czech Skeptics' Club Sisyfos (1995), the Hungarian Skeptic Society (2006), the Polish Sceptics Club (2010) and the Russian-speaking Skeptic Society (2013). The Austrian Skeptical Society in Vienna (founded in 2002) deals with issues such as Johann Grander's \"vitalized water\" and the use of dowsing at the Austrian Parliament\".\n\nThe European Skeptics Congress (ESC) has been held throughout Europe since 1989, from 1994 onwards co-ordinated by the European Council of Skeptical Organizations. In the United States, The Amaz!ng Meeting (TAM) hosted by the JREF in Las Vegas had been the most important skeptical conference since 2003, with two spin-off conferences in London, UK (2009 and 2010) and one in Sydney, Australia (2010). Since 2010, the Merseyside Skeptics Society and Greater Manchester Skeptics jointly organized (QED) in Manchester, UK. World Skeptics Congresses have been held so far, namely in Buffalo, New York (1996), Heidelberg, Germany (1998), Sydney, Australia (2000), Burbank, California (2002), Abano Terme, Italy (2004) and Berlin, Germany (2012).\n\nIn 1991, the Center for Inquiry, a US think-tank, brought the CSICOP and the Council for Secular Humanism (CSH) under one umbrella. In January 2016, the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science announced its merger with the Center for Inquiry.\n\nIn 2010, as a form of skeptical outreach to the general population, Susan Gerbic launched the Guerrilla Skepticism on Wikipedia (GSoW) project to improve skeptical content on Wikipedia. In 2017, Gerbic (who was made a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry in 2018) and her GSoW team received an award from the James Randi Educational Foundation which \"is given to the person or organization that best represents the spirit of the foundation by encouraging critical questions and seeking unbiased, fact-based answers. We are pleased to recognize Susan's efforts to enlist and train a team of editors who continually improve Wikipedia as a public resource for rationality and scientific thought.\"\n\nIn July 2018, \"Wired\" reported that the GSoW team had grown to more than 120 volunteer editors from around the world, and they were collectively responsible for creating or improving some of Wikipedia's most heavily trafficked articles on skeptical topics. As of July 2018, GSoW had created or completely rewritten more than 630 Wikipedia articles in many languages, which together have accumulated over 28 million page visits.\n\nBooks\n\n\nMagazines\n\n\nTelevision programs\n\nPodcasts\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "29641", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29641", "title": "Sound change", "text": "Sound change\n\nResearch on sound change is usually conducted on the working assumption that it is \"regular\", which means that it is expected to apply mechanically whenever its structural conditions are met, irrespective of any non-phonological factors (such as the meaning of the words affected). However, apparent exceptions to regular change can occur—due to dialect borrowing, grammatical analogy, or other causes known and unknown—and some changes are described as \"sporadic\", meaning that they affect only one particular word or a few words, without any apparent regularity.\n\nThe Neogrammarian linguists of the 19th century introduced the term \"sound law\" to refer to rules of regular change, perhaps in imitation of the laws of physics. and the term \"law\" is still used in referring to specific sound rules named after their authors, such as Grimm's Law, Grassmann's Law, . Real-world sound changes often admit exceptions; nevertheless, the expectation of their regularity or absence of exceptions is of great heuristic value, since it allows historical linguists to define the notion of \"regular correspondence\" (see: comparative method).\n\nEach sound change is limited in space and time. This means it functions within a limited area (within certain dialects) and during a limited period of time. For these (and other) reasons, the term \"sound law\" has been criticized for implying a universality that is unrealistic with regard to sound change.\n\nSound change that affects the phonological system, in the number or distribution of its phonemes, is covered more fully at phonological change.\n\nA statement of the form\n\nis to be read, \"sound A changes into (or is replaced by, is reflected as, etc) sound B\". Therefore, A belongs to an older stage of the language in question, whereas B belongs to a more recent stage. The symbol \">\" can be reversed, B < A, still meaning that the (more recent) B derives from the (older) A\".\n\nFor example,\n\nThe two sides of such a statement indicate start and end points only, and do not imply that there are no additional intermediate stages. The example above is actually a compressed account of a \"sequence\" of changes; *t changed first into a voiceless dental fricative (like the initial consonant of English \"thin\"), which has yielded present-day [f]. This can be represented more fully as:\n\nUnless a change operates unconditionally (in all environments), the context in which it applies must be specified:\n\nFor example:\n\nA second example:\n\nThe symbol \"#\" stands for a word boundary (initial or final). Thus the notation \"/__#\" means \"word-finally\", and \"/#__\" means \"word-initially\". For example:\n\nThis can be simplified to\n\nwhere capital P stands for any plosive.\n\nThe following statements are used as heuristics in formulating sound changes as understood within the Neogrammarian model. However, for modern linguistics, they are not taken as inviolable rules; rather, they are seen as guidelines.\n\nSound change has no memory: Sound change does not discriminate between the sources of a sound. If a previous sound change causes X,Y > Y (features X and Y merge as Y), a new one cannot affect only an original X.\n\nSound change ignores grammar: A sound change can only have phonological constraints, like X > Z in unstressed syllables. For example, it cannot only affect adjectives. The only exception to this is that a sound change may or may not recognise word boundaries, even when they are not indicated by prosodic clues. Also, sound changes may be regularized in inflectional paradigms (such as verbal inflection), in which case the change is no longer phonological but morphological in nature.\n\nSound change is exceptionless: if a sound change can happen at a place, it will. It affects all sounds that meet the criteria for change. Apparent exceptions are possible, due to analogy and other regularization processes, or another sound change, or an unrecognized conditioning factor. This is the traditional view, expressed by the Neogrammarians. In past decades it has been shown that sound change does not necessarily affect all the words that in principle it could. However, when a sound change is initiated, it often expands to the whole lexicon given enough time, though not always. For example, in Spanish the fronting of the Vulgar Latin [g] (voiced velar stop) before [i e ɛ] seems to have reached every possible word it could. By contrast, the voicing of word-initial Latin [k] to [g] occurred in \"colaphus\" > \"golpe\" and \"cattus\" > \"gato\", but not in \"canna\" > \"caña\". See also lexical diffusion.\n\nSound change is unstoppable: \"All\" languages vary from place to place and time to time, and neither writing nor media prevent this change.\n\nIn historical linguistics, a number of traditional terms designate types of phonetic change, either by nature or result. A number of such types are often (or usually) sporadic, that is, more or less accidents that happen to a specific form. Others affect a whole phonological system. Sound changes that affect a whole phonological system are also classified according to how they affect the overall shape of the system; see \"phonological change\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6834653", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6834653", "title": "Star Trekkin'", "text": "Star Trekkin'\n\n\"Star Trekkin'\" is a 1987 song by British band The Firm. It parodies the first television series of \"\", and prominently features comical voice caricatures of the original \"Trek\" characters, provided by members of the band, a studio technician, and the wife of one of the songwriters. One of song's phrases, \"It's life, Jim, but not as we know it\", originated with \"Star Trekkin'\", but has been subsequently misattributed to the TV series.\n\nThe song's promotional video was created by a team of art students called The Film Garage, featuring a combination of puppetry, stop motion animation and computer-generated imagery.\n\nThe song entered the UK charts at number 74, eventually climbing to spend two weeks at number 1. It also found chart success in a number of other countries, selling more than a million copies.\n\n\"Star Trekkin originated from songwriter Rory Kehoe's experiences with an English Civil War combat reenactment society called The Sealed Knot. Kehoe had written a series of five lines about the 1960s American science fiction television series \"\", which were sung around campfires, after Sealed Knot battles, to the tune of \"The Music Man\". This version was re-titled \"I Am The Star Trek Man\". Chris Steinhauer performed this version at a folk club one evening in 1986, which is where it was first heard by Grahame Lister, of novelty band The Firm. Lister convinced Steinhauer to record the song onto an audio cassette and took it to his writing partner John O'Connor.\n\nThe duo dropped \"The Music Man\" melody, and wrote a new chorus. They at first attempted to set Kehoe's lyrics to the tune of their 1982 hit single, \"Arthur Daley (e's Alright)\", creating an alternative version initially entitled \"Captain Kirk (He's Alright)\". Unsatisfied, they sought to create something original, locking themselves away for a week to write \"Star Trekkin'\", based on an increasing tempo seen previously in Rolf Harris' \"The Court of King Caractacus\". They sought to have it recorded professionally, but were received unfavourably by potential recording labels. Instead, they recorded it at O'Connor's and Brian O'Shaughnessy's Bark Studios in Walthamstow, East London. The arrangement was by Bill C. Martin, and the rest of The Firm was made up of Dev Douglas and Peter Sills. O'Shaughnessy later said \"One of the greatest highlights of my career was producing 'Star Trekkin. The record was produced to mock the series and we had no idea it was going to be a big hit.\"\n\nThe song features the catchphrases of several \"Star Trek\" characters, including Captain James T. Kirk, Spock and Doctor Leonard McCoy. These were intended to be recognisable to British listeners who had seen the episodes of the series on re-runs throughout the 1970s and 1980s, or those who were only relatively familiar with the source. While several of the lines such as Scotty's \"Ye cannae change the laws of physics!\", or Uhura's \"There's Klingons on the starboard bow.\" had been said in the series, other phrases had not. Spock's quote, \"It's life, Jim, but not as we know it\", never featured in \"The Original Series\" but \"Star Trekkin subsequently so popularised the phrase that it is now commonly misattributed. The closest equivalent in the series is the phrase \"No life as we know it\" in \"The Devil in the Dark\". Kirk's \"We come in peace; shoot to kill\" also never featured, and was suggested by author Brian Robb as having \"summed up the popular impression of the trigger-happy captain's approach to alien encounters\". The voices of the characters were not provided by the actors who portrayed them in \"The Original Series\"; O'Connor voiced the Kirk and McCoy, while Douglas voiced Spock. Scotty was voiced by a studio engineer and O'Connor's wife, Shelly, voiced Uhura.\n\nHaving funded the pressing of 500 copies of the single, O'Connor sent copies of it to British radio stations, with the studio's phone number on them. One Liverpool station began giving the phone number out on air and O'Connor began to receive many phone calls from the area, asking for copies of the record. A Radio 1 disc jockey, Simon Bates, promoted the song and after an initial release where it reached 74th position in the on the UK Singles Chart, it climbed the following week to 13th place. For the two weeks afterwards, it was placed at number one, and becoming the ninth best-selling single of 1987 in the UK. While it was at number one, it kept Whitney Houston's \"I Wanna Dance With Somebody\" in second place, which was previously at number one. At one point, it was selling 60,000 copies a day, and went on to sell more than 470,000 copies in the UK alone.\n\nThe single was also released outside of the UK, reaching 22nd place in the Ultratop chart within Belgium, 9th place in the neighbouring Dutch Top 40, and on the other side of the world, it reached third place in the ARIA Charts within Australia and peaked at the number 2 spot on Official New Zealand Music Chart. Worldwide, it sold more than a million copies. \"Star Trekkin has become well known in the United States due to frequent play on the \"Dr. Demento Show\" radio program.\n\nThe Firm subsequently released an album, \"Serious Fun\", in 1987, through K-Tel in the UK and Dino Music in Australia. \"Star Trekkin was track one on the A-side of the record, and the album featured previous single \"Arthur Daley (e's Alright)\". The album also featured the follow-up single to \"Star Trekkin, \"Superheroes\", which was released in the UK on 26 September that year. It reached the 99th spot in the top 100, while the album did not chart.\n\nFollowing the success of the single, the band realised that they would be expected to appear on the British television series \"Top of the Pops\" on BBC1 the following week. The decision was made not to make personal television appearances, as O'Connor and Lister felt that they were a \"bunch of balding thirty-something’s\" and an appearance as themselves on the show \"would kill the whole fun element of the thing stone dead!\" So despite the time limit, they sought for an animated music video to be created. They approached several potential providers, including the production company behind the television series \"Spitting Image\", who had previously produced the video for the single \"Land of Confusion\" by Genesis. However, the cost was too high, and they needed longer than the week to create the video. One of the other companies approached were a team of graduate art students called The Film Garage. On a low budget, the new company created a claymation stop motion animated video.\n\nThe characters in the video are based on food items, such as being made out of potatoes, with the \"Enterprise\" being created to look like it was made from pizza and sausages. The idea for the video as described by co-director Pete Bishop was that \"Kirk has been out in space too long, and is hallucinating – about food\". It was shot over seven days under the direction of Pete Bishop and Marc Kitchen-Smith, while the company No Strings were responsible for the model construction. The video was completed with hours to spare before it was due to air for the first time on \"Top of the Pops\".\n\nIn Brian Robb's 2012 book, \"A Brief Guide to Star Trek\", he said it was a testament to the quality of the series and of the characters that some 20 years after it was originally broadcast, a series of catchphrases could still summarise the appeal of the television series. The song has appeared in several lists, such as in MSN's list of the most annoying songs of all time, \"Star Trekkin, placed in 15th place. British Sunday newspaper \"The People\" included it in a list of the most irritating songs in 2005, calling it \"Funny, but dreadful.\" In 2011, it was included in \"Wired\"'s list of seven great geek comedy songs.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5171532", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5171532", "title": "Stone Protectors", "text": "Stone Protectors\n\nStone Protectors is a British/American/French multi-media entertainment property consisting primarily of an action figure line and animated series. The series also had a tie-in video game released for the Super NES. It served as a late attempt to market the troll doll craze of the early 1990s to young boys. While not particularly successful, nor inspired by a prior medium, Stone Protectors generally followed in the same vein as contemporaries including Toxic Crusaders, Swamp Thing, and the highly popular Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.\n\nA kingdom built of crystals came under attack by the Saurians whose leader, Zok, desired the powerful crystals protected by the Empress. Zok broke into the castle and reached for the crystals only to see them explode into pieces and fly to Earth.\n\nAfter being thrown out the back door of a New York City club, an awful rock band known as the Rock Detectors found the five magical stones which gave them troll-like appearances and special skills (not the least of which is playing \"good\" music). This put them at odds with the music-hating Zok and his henchman Zink, collectively known as The Prodtectors.\n\n\nA short-lived cartoon series based on the characters debuted in 1993. In it, Empress Opal of Mythrandir splits the legendary Great Crystal into six pieces to keep it out of Zok's hands. Zok manages to capture one piece, but the other five bond with the future Stone Protectors, spiriting them away to Mythrandir to help Opal upset Zok's schemes and spread a sentiment of peace and freedom with their music. The series lasted one season; 8 out of 13 episodes were released on VHS in 1994 by Family Home Entertainment, the whole series was released on VHS in England.\n\nIt's notable that while the advertisements for the action figures attempted to tie the Stone Protectors into the troll doll fad, the cartoon seemed eager to avoid the comparison. For instance, it replaced the line \"trolls on a roll\" from the theme song in the commercials with \"Don't you know?\"\n\nThe series has also been broadcast on the BBC in England, TV2 in Malaysia, Bop TV in South Africa and TV2 in New Zealand.\n\nThe Stone Protectors action figures were produced by the Ace Novelty Toy Company. All of the figures were roughly 5\" tall and featured cut joints at the neck, shoulders, and elbows as well as ball joints at the hips. Their heads were a soft, rubbery material with tall, synthetic hair sticking straight out the top. In rotating the right arm of a Stone Protectors figure, a flint module would ignite inside its chest, creating a quick yet bright flash seen through the translucent chest emblem. A second series of sports-themed figures was also released. Princess Opal was never made as a figure, nor were there any generic Saurian Guards.\n\nUnfortunately, the toyline as well as the cartoon that followed it were seen as poor imitations of the popular Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles line of toys and cartoon series and overlooked by many.\n\nA Super NES game based on the property was released in November 1994 by Kemco. A Genesis version was developed and completed, but not released. This version, intended to be published by Vic Tokai, was finally leaked to the public in 2010.\n\n\"Stone Protectors\" features 10 levels in which the heroes – Clifford, Cornelius, Chester, Maxwell, and Angus – battle The Predators throughout their mission to retrieve Zok's crystal and bring them all back to the kingdom. Weapons can also be acquired but only used by certain characters. Depending on the difficulty setting, the game's ending scene also features different music in which the Stone Protectors are seen performing as a band.\n\n\"GamePro\" gave the game a generally negative review, commenting that the graphics are good but the animation is poor, and the controls make it difficult to pull off special attacks or counteract enemy attacks. They concluded the game, while not without merits, is overall \"a frustrating journey.\"\n\nPressman Toy Corp. released a Stone Protectors board game. In late 1993, Harvey Comics debuted \"Stone Protectors\" \"Premiere Issue\" (effectively an issue #0), followed by issues #1–3.\n\n"}
{"id": "5238117", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5238117", "title": "Séamas Dall Mac Cuarta", "text": "Séamas Dall Mac Cuarta\n\nSéamas Dall Mac Cuarta (c. 1647? – 1733) was an Irish poet, and a central figure in the seventeenth and eighteenth century Airgíalla school of poets and songwriters in the Irish language. Like his neighbours Peadar Ó Doirnín, Art Mac Cumhaigh and Cathal Buí Mac Giolla Ghunna, Mac Cuarta was part of the Airgíalla tradition of poetry and song.\n\nMac Cuarta was possibly born in Omeath in County Louth, although Kilkerley to the north-west of Dundalk is also mentioned as bearing links to his life; he appears to have spent most of his life moving around this area and the Boyne Valley. As his name suggests, he was either blind or had seriously impaired vision and, at a time when gentry patronage of the poetic class was on the wane, this placed more emphasis on his literary skills rather than the traditional poetic tools of flattery towards their patrons. He was, by all accounts, very sociable and among his friends were fellow musicians and poets Niall Óg Mac Mhurchaidh, Pádraig Mac Giolla Fhiondáin (1665–1733), and Toirdhealbhach Ó Cearbhalláin (1670–1738).\n\nHis works display a close affiliation with the older literary traditions, as well as the influence of contemporary popular song and balladry. In the words of Nollaig Ó Muraíle, \"Mac Cuarta's poetry reflects a familiarity with Irish literature and history, the classics (Greek and Latin), and the Bible.\"\n\nHis poems also bear a very strong resonance to the political turmoil of the period or, as Ó Muraíle put it, 'Much of Mac Cuarta's work echoes the political events of his time, such as the catastrophic battle of Aughrim (1691)—which inspired \"Tuireamh Shomhairle Mhic Dónaill\" (a lament for a Catholic leader who fell in that battle)—and the subsequent subjugation of his people by the English, who are condemned both as foreigners and heretics.'\n\nAmong Séamas's patrons were chieftains of Gaelic and Norman origin, and he dedicated poems to, among others, Toirealach Ó Néill, Brian Mac Naois, Brian Mac Eoghain, Mac Airt Uí Néill, Baron Slane. \nHe lamented in particular the overthrow of the Ó Néill chiefs of the Fews in south Armagh, whose castle in Glasdrummond lay deserted at the time of his writing. However, despite his praise of these nobles, Séamas dismissed nobles who he believed did not resist the English sufficiently; instead, he promoted men without noble lineage but who resisted the English conquest.\n\nHis poetry also displays a great love of nature, despite his blindness—a love most poignantly shown in 'Fáilte don éan' from c. 1707. His best poems are those in the form of Trí Rainn agus Amhrán: three stanzas in loose syllabic verse and one stanza in song form, where both traditions are finely merged. Unlike the classic poetry of most of his contemporaries, Mac Cuarta's work displays a strong feeling for nature, a tendency which marked the Early Irish poets. Other poems praise women, although these are not considered to be among his most passionate poems. Some fifty of Mac Cuarta's poems still survive. They are contained in about 130 manuscripts, the earliest of which is from 1690.\n\nSéamas Dall Mac Cuarta died in 1733, and is buried in an unmarked grave in the old graveyard at Monknewton, Co. Meath.\n\n\n"}

It was used in feudal Europe and its colonies in the early modern period, as well as the early American frontier, mostly as a type of mob vengeance (compare Lynch law). It is also used in modern popular culture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe image of the tarred-and-feathered outlaw remains a metaphor for public humiliation many years after the practice became uncommon. To tar and feather someone can mean to punish or severely criticize that person.

{"id": "25154227", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25154227", "title": "Tulipamwe", "text": "Tulipamwe\n\nTulipamwe means \"we are together\" and is an independently funded artists project coordinated by the Tulipamwe Arts Trust in Namibia. The trust is organized under the auspices of the Visual & Performing Arts Department of the University of Namibia and is affiliated to the Triangle Network of Workshops initiated by Sir Robert Lauder.\n\nHistorically Namibia (in southern Africa) has been isolated by the politics of the Apartheid Government in South Africa from the rest of the world and especially from the rest of Africa (except South Africa) for over fifty years. This isolation has been in almost every sphere of interaction, but especially in the arts. The cultural boycott of South Africa extended to Namibia, and South Africa’s policy of destabilization of her neighbours ensured that Namibians did not interact peacefully with these “front-line states”. Since independence (1989) and since democracy in South Africa (1994) this isolation has been addressed in many different ways. Namibians are encouraged to see themselves as part of Africa rather than just a part of South Africa and in the Visual Arts, Tulipamwe has been a major force in the opening up of Namibia’s arts to Africa and the world and the introduction of foreign artists to Namibia.\n\nTulipamwe, aptly, means ‘we are together’. As an international workshop it aims to fulfill the promise of its name. The first Tulipamwe International Artists Workshop was held in 1994. The workshops bring together about 20 artists from all over the world. Artists from Uganda, Zimbabwe, Mauritius, Rwanda, South Africa, Nigeria, Spain, USA, and Germany all applied. The selection process is strictly monitored by members of the organizational committee. The criteria for selection is based on the work submitted with the application and what the artist could bring to the workshop and on how much the artist is expected to gain from it, this allows for both students and professional artists to gain and receive in equal measures. Tulipamwe brings people together who have nothing in common besides their artistic passion which has proved time and time again to be all that is needed for success. Artists were not expected to come with any preparation, but rather to be open to new ideas in a new environment.\n\nTulipamwe is funded annually by sponsors, such as the Triangle Trust and the Ford Foundation as well as the foreign embassies operating in Windhoek. It depends entirely on the support of these sponsors as it is a non-profit organization founded simply for the benefit of local communities and artists.\n\nIn 2008 Tulipamwe was held at Okombahe, a rural community, with a design that included the local people. Five of the local residents of Okombahe participated. This article concentrates mainly on this workshop and the work created by the participants.\nAfter the long process of organizing and coordinating the artists met, travelled to Okombahe and worked together for two solid weeks. Both International artists and local artists where encouraged to experiment with different materials and styles. This gave all the artists the opportunity to learn from each other. Seven nationalities, including Namibia, where represented. These artists were all at different stages of training and understanding in artistic ability and inter-cultural contact. Many of the artists had attended international workshops of a similar nature while for others this was their first.\n\nThe Tulipamwe project was founded in 1994. Since then more than 200 Namibian artists and international artists have taken part in successful workshops. The Tulipamwe workshops have been held in many different locations; each of these was chosen for its peaceful atmosphere and more recently for the surrounding community. Tulipamwe has gone through a series of small changes over the last 14 years as it has changed hands three times during this time.\n\nThe Tulipamwe project was originally inspired by the Triangle Trust's workshop model. This was an international model on which many other similar projects have been based. Tulipamwe was founded in Namibia with the help of a consultant from the UK, Anna Kindersly, who co-ordinated the first workshop in 1994. The coordination was then taken over by the staff of the Visual Arts Department of the University of Namibia (UNAM). UNAM and the working group hosted six International Artists Workshops until 1999. These workshops all concentrated on the artists’ creative exploration. From 1999 to 2004 Tulipamwe was independently run by a Namibian artist, Jo Rogge. Four international workshops were held during this time. In 2005 it returned to the management of UNAM. The aims were then revived and revised and the workshops started again in 2008.\n\n1994 – Otjiwa Game Lodge The first international artists' workshop in Namibia was held at Otjiwa Game Lodge. The workshop was highly anticipated and much was expected of it.\n\"“In planning, the working group anticipated that the Tulipamwe process would address a broad spectrum of creative issues relevant to contemporary Namibian art. What however could not have been anticipated was the degree of success. Not only did the workshop address these predicted issues but it generated an exceptionally high degree of creative energy, experimentation, and learning-through-sharing”\"\nIt is clear that Tulipamwe exceeded its aims, this can be seen not only in the statements made by the participants and organizers but also by the fact that it continues to be promoted today. In this workshop the main impromptu educational focus was on sculpture. A lot of Namibian artists such as Silverius Olibile and Trudi Dicks started their first sculpture pieces at Tulipamwe with the help of sculptors from Zimbabwe, SA and Zambia.\nArtists attended from: Botswana, Namibia, UK, USA, Germany, France, Mozambique, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Senegal and South-Africa.\n\n1995 – Peperkorrel Farm Tulipamwe was then held at Peperkorrel Farm, this farm is the home and studio of internationally famous Namibian sculptor Dorte Berner. The coordinator of this workshop was Hercules Viljoen, a Namibian artist who is head of the visual arts department at UNAM. Because of the different backgrounds of the artists who attend these workshops different opinions are often argued over. In 1995 a spontaneous and rather explosive debate erupted over the relevance and validity of abstract art, the debate ended amicably and so Tulipamwe was all the more rewarding and renewing. The final exhibit at the end of the workshop brought with it a totally new experience for the National Gallery of Namibia. This was the first time that an installation piece was exhibited in the space. This installation, called ‘Territories viii: Dreams of Africa”, was produced by Jack Beng-Thi a visiting artist from France-Reunion.\n\nArtists attended from France-Reunion, Congo, Namibia, UK, Germany, Zambia, Zimbabwe and South-Africa.\n\n1996 – Zebra River Lodge\nHercules Viljoen coordinated this workshop at Zebra River Lodge, a country lodge in the south of Namibia situated in the beautiful Zebra River Valley. This Tulipamwe, like all the others, had the aim of encouraging the free flow of ideas and information between professional artists from within Namibia and from abroad. This meeting of artistic minds has been described as \"an exciting and stimulating experience of personal growth that can not be duplicated other than in a similar workshop situation\" by Cathy McRoberts, a Namibian artist in 1996. This workshop inspired one of its participants, Samuel Amunkete, to further his education in the arts. In a similar way the land art, by Eric Pongerard from France-Reunion, inspired many of the Namibian artists to continue in this style, and this is coming out more and more clearly today.\n\nArtists attended from: Botswana, Namibia, Kenya, Zimbabwe, UK, India, South Africa,\nFrance-Reunion, Zambia, France, Germany and Spain\n\n1997- Otjiruze Guest Lodge\nBy the fourth annual workshop, Tulipamwe had become one of the major annual events in the Namibian cultural calendar. The coordinator of this workshop, held at Otjiruze Guest Lodge, was Hercules Viljoen. The location of this workshop resounded so well with the artists that it was used again for the next two Tulipamwe workshops. This workshop brought out in its participants a wish to express their own social, political, moral, and religious beliefs. Eric Schnack, from Namibia, produced work depicting his disgust for game hunting. Max Edison, from Namibia, used his work to bring awareness to mistreated women and children. Moitshepi Mandidela, from Botswana, worked mainly on works that revolved around religion, his primary piece was called ‘My peoples religion’\nArtists attended from: Australia, Mozambique, Namibia, Zambia, UK, South-Africa, France-Reunion, France, Germany and Spain\n\n1998- Otjiruze Guest Lodge\nThis was the last workshop coordinated by Hercules Viljoen before it became a privately run project in 1999. Nine of the participating Namibian artists had attended Tulipamwe workshops previously and were able to build on their experiences and skills. This is an important part of the workshop.\n\n1999- Otjiruze Guest Farm\nJo Rogge coordinated and ran Tulipamwe in 1999 and in spite of the change in coordinator the ethos remained the same. Seven of the participants had attended Tulipamwe before.\nArtists attended from: Namibia, Denmark, Botswana, Spain, Norway, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Rwanda, Germany, South Africa, Finland and Zambia.\n\n\"'2000 - Kansimba Game Lodge\"\n'This workshop was held at a lodge near Karibib in the Erongo region and was coordinated by Jo Rogge. The participant from Zimbabwe, Chiko, remained after the workshop to host a series of printmaking classes at the John Muafangejo Art Centre.\nArtists attended from: Namibia, Norway, Zimbabwe, Finland, Zambia, South Africa, UK, Germany, Botswana, France and Spain.\n\n2001 – Gobabeb Research Station\nThe experiences of the artists at the Gobabeb Research Station tended to be more tranquil and serene. This was mainly because the research station is in the middle of the desert, on the divide between the dune fields and the gravel plains, and is situated in an extremely barren area. This seems to have had an effect on the art produced, much of it inspired by nature. The artist from Ireland, Janet Crimble made a large piece of land art in the riverbed made entirely of the pods from the indigenous trees. Francois Niay made large drawings of natural objects.\nArtists attended from: Namibia, Northern Ireland, Botswana, Spain, Finland, France, Mozambique, South Africa, Norway and Germany\n\n2003 – Otjiruze Guest Farm\nThis Tulipamwe was coordinated by Jo Rogge and had an emphasis on experience and professionalism. \"Enthusiasm for participation over the years has not waned, rather, artists eagerly forward their applications\". Sculpture and installation art once again were a huge portion of the work produced.\nArtists attended from: Namibia, Uganda, France, Mozambique, Finland, Norway, Zimbabwe.\n\nThe Tulipamwe Arts Trust is an independent body attached to the University of Namibia which provides some logistical and administrative support but the workshops need to be funded annually. It is approved by the Ministry of Basic Education and Culture as well as the National Art Gallery of Namibia. The coordinator and the working group seek funding each year for the running of the workshop. The funding is used for transport, accommodation, catering, materials and publicity. Traditionally the workshop is funded by international donors such as HIVOS, a Dutch funding agency and the Ford Foundation. Funding is also acquired from local international agencies such as the Goethe Centre, the American Cultural Centre, the Franco Namibian Cultural Centre and UNESCO. The private sector in Namibia has also provided funding in the form of services and materials. The funders are acknowledged widely in the press as well as in the catalogues and on the web site. An Open Day is held at the end of the workshop to give an opportunity for the sponsors to meet and talk to the artists in their studios and to view the work created. At the end of a workshop the donors are presented with an artwork in thanks for their sponsorship.\n\nTriangle Arts Trust is an umbrella organization that facilitates and supports various workshop initiatives in 23 countries all over the world. It helps to support at least 10 different workshop organizations in Sub-Saharan Africa. Artists often attend more than one workshop in various countries and start to form connections with countries, arts institutions and artists all over the region. Some of these workshops are: Thapong – Botswana, Thupelo – South Africa, Aftershave – Nigeria, Batapata – Zimbabwe, Kuona – Kenya, Insaka – Zambia\nUta Goeble-Gross, from Germany, compared her experience at the 2008 Tulipamwe workshop to two other workshops she had attended in Cape Town. While these urban experiences were both educative and useful to the communities, they lacked the connection she felt to the other artists at Tulipamwe. She felt that the isolation in the empty landscape made it a more individual experience and so allowed her to expand, and work on a bigger scale.\n\nArterial is an arts network for Africa and provides active network of individuals, organizations, sponsors, companies, and institutions all of which deal with African culture and the arts. This Network was formed to support African arts and to aid the growth of creative projects in Africa. An example of one of Arterials workshops was one that was held recently in Zimbabwe, Harare, it dealt with the marketing strategies of arts organizations. Tulipamwe makes use of networks such as this one and Triangle to advertise their workshops.\n\nIn 1994 Tulipamwe was coordinated by Anna Kindersley, from England, she described the benefits of Tulipamwe.\n\"“The benefits emanating from such a workshop are many and varied. The positive effects in participants’ work may sometimes be seen months later together with the knock-on effects for the artists’ respective community or country. The inaugural Tulipamwe has created new and important networks between artists in SA, West Africa, Europe, and USA. This will open new horizons for Namibian artists such as opportunities to participate in sister workshops and to exhibit and work in other countries.”\"\nWhen the aims of Tulipamwe changed to focus on community development (2008) the value of the Tulipamwe project also increased. The local artists who participate in Tulipamwe have the opportunity to apply their creativity in a cultural context and to pass on skills to their community. This may change the perception of artists as people who are willing to share skills and knowledge as opposed to people reliant on community aid. The idea that art can be an income generating activity is also now encouraged.\n\nTulipamwe has always been located in isolated areas and, more recently, in rural communities. This is one of its unique qualities. These areas have been called ‘marvelous’ and ‘spiritual and quiet warming’. Many other workshops are located in large cities right in the center of the hustle and bustle of everyday life; Tulipamwe escapes this, and so much more time can be spent concentrating on the individual. Uta Goebel-Gross (2008; Germany) explained in her interview how the new environment allowed her to expand as an artist. The absence of day-to-day chores and commitments allows artists a unique space in which to make their art. At the same time, this rural setting allows a whole community to develop and benefit from the workshop.\n\nIn 2008 it was particularly clear that Okombahe, its people and environment, featured strongly in the art works produced. Okombahe - the \"Place of the Giraffe\" appeared in the imagery of paintings and large ceramics were made out of clay from the Omaruru river and were fired in a self-built kiln. Found materials (seed pods, rusty tins) were in artworks and installations. As Seth Basson, a member of the Okombahe community stated, \"I learned that you can make beautiful things from scratch, trees and waste\".\n\nPersonal benefits to artists\n\nThe fact that Tulipamwe was first of all a learning workshop was reiterated by many of the local artists who participated. They were often exposed to western art for the first time and many learnt about abstract and conceptual art from a different perspective. Links were formed across language barriers and many local artists worked in new ways for the first time. Like Ester Ihuhwa a Namibian craftsperson “I enjoyed painting on canvas for the first time. I was very happy to meet new friends from so many different places.”\nDias Machate( 1994 Mozambique). “I’m a teacher but Tulipamwe was anyway a constellation of knowledges: a university in which anyone may become a student of another through exchanges of experience.”\n\nForeign artists often do not know what to expect from Namibia or Tulipamwe, the experience of working in a rural African setting is often daunting but nonetheless rewarding. Simon Faithfull, from Britain, participate in the 1997 Tulipamwe project, during his time there he wrote a journal of his experience. He worked both as a conceptual and installation artist.\nIn an unusual turnabout, foreign artists are usually more isolated in their own workspaces than local artists, this is because in the large cities they come from they are pressed for studio space and find it hard to work in groups because there is a lack of space. Generally in developed countries people are isolated by their living arrangements, which are very different from the communal living apparent in less developed countries. African artists often share resources, materials, and space. They tend to work together on projects this perhaps originated in the communal making of traditional functional objects such as baskets and pots.\nIn the words of a German Tulipamwe participant: “Artists are usually solitary and to be forced to work as a group is unusual and challenging. For me it was a journey of self-discovery where all the artists worked together and helped each other.”\nExposure to raw materials such as clay from riverbeds, abundant indigenous wood and found materials has been inspirational to many of the foreign participants.\n\nTulipamwe 2008 held in Okombahe, as an international artists workshop, was dormant for the 3 years between 2004 and 2007. This was due to a lack of committed people with time to organize an event like this. The new Tulipamwe was launched in 2007 with new commitment from UNAM to ensure that the project was sustainable. A new working group was gathered together; who would be responsible for the organization, funding and selecting of participants. Tulipamwe was legally constituted as the Tulipamwe Arts Trust and a Board of Trustees was formed, the trustees are high profile members of the Namibian art community as well as a lawyer and an accountant. In 2007 it was decided to work towards the first workshop in 2008.\n\nThe original vision for Tulipamwe was not changed, instead it was given broader aims that encompassed a much larger goal. Tulipamwe now focuses not only on artistic development but also on helping needy communities by holding the workshop in their vicinity and including community members in the program.\n\n1. To create an invigorating artistic environment for Namibian artists to share creative skills with each other and with international artists.\n\n2. To provide international artists with the opportunity to work in a unique African environment where they can explore new creative avenues.\n\n3. To benefit a disadvantaged community by bringing positive energy, activity and community engagement to it through visual arts initiatives.\n\n4. To allow the community the initiative to share in Tulipamwe’s funding by providing workshop facilities, accommodation and meals to workshop participants.\n\n5. To celebrate local traditions and culture as integral part of the global community.\n\n6. To create the opportunity for development in visual art, thereby contributing to Namibia’s cultural capital.\n\nIt was decided to hold the next Tulipamwe International Workshop in a rural community. Various communities were investigated. Among those investigated was Gibeon and Bathseba, in the south; however, they were not chosen due to the lack of interest shown by community leaders. Instead the elders of the village council at Okombahe in the Erongo region near Omaruru were approached.\nOkombahe showed enthusiasm and could provide accommodation in the form of a large community house. The community was also able to provide catering services and had several interested artists who wished to participate. Six of these artists were chosen by the community elders and came in on a daily basis to work with the other artists.\nThrough the different artist’s networks, including the Triangle Trust, a call for applications from international artists was sent out. There was an overwhelming response and the fundraising began. By May 2008 the selection process was complete. Artists from Mauritius, SA, USA, France, Germany and Botswana as well as 12 from Namibia where chosen to participate. Due to insufficient funds a lot of the artists had to fund their own travel costs.\n\nTulipamwe 2008 was held in Okombahe (place of the giraffe) The following artists participated in Tulipamwe 2008: Nirveda Alleck, a painter and installation artist from Mauritius; Diana Hyslop, an object maker from South Africa; Hannah Naomi Kim, a new media artist and painter from the USA; Raphael Caloone an animator and sculptor from France; Uta Goebel- Gross a painter from Germany; Kim Modise a painter from Botswana; Shiya Karuseb an installation artist and print maker from Namibia; Gretta Nashongo a textile maker from Namibia; Helena Iitembu a painter from Namibia; John Nampala a ceramic artist from Namibia; Abneil Enkali a mixed media artist from Namibia; and Barbara Böhlke a painter from Namibia. Hulda Gomachas, Cecilia Gowases, Seth Basson, Sandro! Naruseb, MC Henry Gomachab and Ebeneyus Ebos were the participating Okombahe Community Artists.\n\nThe artists arrived from their various countries a few days before the workshop. They were accommodated in a Bed and Breakfast. They spent the following few days getting to know one another in Windhoek. On the 16th of August all of the artists were transported to Okombahe with the use of UNAM combis. The Artists immediately got to work and started to experiment with new media. Half way through the workshop the artists were taken to the Brandberge on an outing. This was an astonishing experience for both the Namibian and foreign artists as many of them had never been to this area.\n\nOpen day was held on the 29th of August, press, sponsors and other interested parties all attended. They were shown around the area and were given the chance to see the work that had been produced in the space where it had been made, they were also able to talk to the artists about the process of production.\n\nAfter the workshop back in Windhoek a public discussion was organized and held at the FNCC (Franco Namibian Cultural Center), and an exhibition of selected works was held at the Goethe Center. The exhibition was opened by Joy Sasman, the chairperson of the Board of Trustees; quite a few sales were made.\n\n"}

Mostly it uses the chest register and is close to a controlled scream. Air escapes through the fully open throat. They are used for the upper and medium resonators, laryngeal cartilage, bones and air cavities in the head and throat. A characteristic feature of this kind of voice is its brightness and intensity, more important than the smooth running and control of breathing. Most of the traditional songs feature the modal voice register.\n\nIt had been practiced since ancient times among the rural population in Central and Eastern Europe. Loud and clear singing originates from practicing in the open air while working in the fields.\n\nIt was used during weddings and annual rituals, khorovodes, in large gatherings human in small spaces.\n\nUkraine, Lithuania, Belarus, Russia and Bulgaria white voice takes part polyphonic singing. In Poland, Czech, Slovak the approach uses one voice (monody).\n\nToday, more and more frequently held workshops of the white voice conducted by the followers of the old way of singing.\n"}
{"id": "2954927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2954927", "title": "Wu Ming", "text": "Wu Ming\n\nWu Ming (extended name: Wu Ming Foundation) is a pseudonym for a group of Italian authors formed in 2000 from a subset of the Luther Blissett community in Bologna.\nFour of the group earlier wrote the novel \"Q\" (first edition 1999). Unlike the open name \"Luther Blissett\", \"Wu Ming\" stands for a defined group of writers active in literature and popular culture. The band authored several novels, some of which have been translated in many countries.\n\nTheir books are seen as part of a body of literary works (the \"nebula\", as it is frequently called in Italy) described as the New Italian Epic, a phrase that was proposed by Wu Ming.\n\nIn Chinese, \"wu ming\" can mean \"anonymous\" () or, with a different tone on the first syllable, \"five people\" (), the pun being part of the reason the collective adopted the name. The name is meant both as a tribute to dissidents (\"Wu Ming\" is a common byline among Chinese citizens demanding democracy and freedom of speech) and as a rejection of the celebrity-making machine which turns the author into a star. \"Wu Ming\" is also a reference to the third sentence in the \"Daodejing\": \"Heaven and Earth's nameless origin\" ().\n\nThe members of Wu Ming are typically known as \"Wu Ming 1\", \"Wu Ming 2\", \"Wu Ming 3\", \"Wu Ming 4\", and \"Wu Ming 5\". Real names are not secret though:\n\n\nThe five authors do extensive book tours (which they describe as \"almost gratefuldeadesque\") and frequently appear in public. However, they refuse to be photographed or filmed by the media. Even on their official website, they do not provide any pictures of themselves. Here is how Wu Ming 1 explained the group's stance in a 2007 interview:\n\nIn Wu Ming's official biographical page (Italian version), the collective denies rumors they once beat up a press photographer:\n\n\"54\" is a complex novel about popular culture, the shattered dreams of the Italian Resistance, and the relationship between Europe and America.\n\nBackground research began in 1999, after the publication of the group's previous novel \"Q\". Plots were outlined in the aftermath of the Kosovo war. Actual writing work ended ten days after 11 September, on the eve of the war in Afghanistan. These two wars are explicitly referred to in the novel's \"End Titles\": \"Begun in May 1999, during the Nato bombings of Belgrade. Delivered to the Italian publishers on September 21, 2001, awaiting the escalation\". The events leading to (and following) 11 September are also allegorically described in the book's forenote.\n\n\"54\" was published in Italy in the springtime of 2002. In the following months, Wu Ming collaborated with Italian folk-rock band , whose ensuing concept album \"\" (2004) was directly inspired from the novel.\n\nWu Ming is also credited as co-writers for the Italian film \"\" (aka \"Radio Alice\"), directed by , released in Italy in 2004.\n\nThe original title means \"Working slowly\" and cites a protest song, a popular leftist anthem in the 1970s: \"Work slowly / And effortlessly / Work may hurt you / And send you to the hospital / Where there's no bed left / And you may even die. / Work slowly / And effortlessly / Health is priceless.\" (Translated by Wu Ming)\n\nThe film is set during an actual student uprising that paralysed Bologna for several days in March 1977. Several narrative threads are woven around Radio Alice, the station run by the \"creative wing\" (the so-called \"Mao-Dadaists\") of the radical Autonomia movement. In the morning of 11 March a brawl involving radical and catholic students escalated to a full-scale riot in the university district. The Carabinieri riot squad attacked and shot down a 25-year-old student called Francesco Lorusso. As a result, thousands of students and activists stormed the centre of the town, clashing with the police and throwing molotov cocktails. On 13 March the premises of Radio Alice were invaded and vandalised by the police, the station was shut down and every member of the staff was arrested. The film tells the story mixing real anecdotes with semi-fictional characters.\n\n\"Radio Alice\" has won several awards and prizes at movie festivals all over Europe, including the Marcello Mastroianni Award for the Best Young Actors at the 2004 Venice Film Festival and the First Prize at the 2005 Festival de Cinema Politic in Barcelona, Spain.\n\n\"Manituana\" is the third of Wu Ming's collectively authored novels. It was written in the 2003–07 period and published in Italy in 2007. It is the first episode of an 18th-century pan-Atlantic trilogy which the authors call \"the Atlantic Triptych\". All novels will be set in the 1770s, all across the Atlantic Ocean (North America, Europe, the West Indies and Africa), before and during the American Revolution.\n\nIn the springtime of 2007, \"Manituana\" reached No. 4 in the Italian best-seller charts The English translation was published in the UK and the US by Verso Books in the Fall of 2009.\n\nIn an entry on their weblog, Wu Ming wrote that\n\nThe novel is set in the years 1775–1783 in New York's Mohawk Valley, Quebec and London (UK). Among the many real historical chapters that populate the book, the most important ones are Joseph Brant, war chief of the Mohawk nation, and Molly Brant, a matron of the Wolf clan in the Iroquois Six Nations.\n\nIn Italy \"Manituana\" was awarded the Premio Sergio Leone 2007 and the Premio Emilio Salgari 2008. In November 2010 it was nominated for International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award.\n\nIn May 2009 Wu Ming announced that they had almost finished writing a new book, entitled \"Altai\", set \"in [their debut novel] Q's world and historical continuum\". \"After this accomplishment\", they added, \"we'll go back to the Atlantic Triptych.\" Later on, they explained:\nThe novel, entitled \"Altai\", was published in Italy on 20 November 2009 and immediately reached No. 5 in the national list of best-sellers.\n\nStarting from 2001, each individual member of Wu Ming also authored one or more \"solo\" novels. Some of them have been translated into other languages, but not yet in English.\n\nWu Ming 1 is the author of \"New Thing\" (2004), an \"unidentified narrative object\" blending fiction, journalism and free verse. It is an allegorical tale on free jazz and the 1960s, set in 1967 New York City and constructed around John Coltrane's final days. The French newspaper \"Le Monde\" described the book as \"a choral novel, an inquiry, and a political jam-session loaded with syncopated poetry\".\n\nWu Ming 2 is the author of \"Guerra agli umani\" [War on the Humans] (2004), a satire of primitivism and survivalism set on the Apennines in an undefined year. The main character and narrator is called Marco, but he nicknames himself \"Marco Walden\", after Thoreau's \"Walden\". At the beginning of the book, Marco quits his job as a restroom cleaner at a big cemetery, because he wants to leave the city (presumably Bologna, although it remains unnamed), go to the mountains and become a \"hunter-gatherer superhero\".\n\nWu Ming 4 is the author of \"Stella del mattino\" [Star of the Morning] (2008). The novel is set in 1919 Oxford and centered around T.E. Lawrence suffering writer's block while working on The Seven Pillars of Wisdom. Among the characters Lawrence encounters in the book, important roles are played by writers J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis and, most notably, Robert Graves. Wu Ming themselves described \"Stella del mattino\" as \"the best solo novel ever manufactured in our smithy\" and \"a bridge between our collective and solo novels\".\n\nWu Ming 5 is the author of both \"Havana Glam\" (2001) and \"Free Karma Food\" (2007). \"Havana Glam\" is set in an alternate 1970s world where David Bowie is a communist sympathizer and has a \"Cuban period\" instead of a \"\". This causes some turmoil in Havana, as the Cuban intelligence suspect the rockstar to be an infiltrator. \"Free Karma Food\" describes a future society where all kinds of cattle have been killed by a global pandemic known as \"The Great Murrain\". Some Italian critics described Wu Ming 5's novels as belonging to the literary subgenre known as \"New Weird\". Such inclusion, however, has been questioned in weblogs and social network discussion groups devoted to science-fiction.\n\nWu Ming 1 is the Italian translator of several Elmore Leonard novels. He translated \"Cat Chaser\", \"Freaky Deaky\", \"Tishomingo Blues\" and \"Mr Paradise\", and wrote an essay on how to render Leonard's prose into Italian The essay was published in the catalogue of the 2006 \"Courmayer Noir in Festival\", at which Leonard was presented with the Raymond Chandler Award. Wu Ming 1 also translated one Walter Mosley novel, \"Little Scarlet\". In 2010 he became the Italian translator of Stephen King's books.\n\nWu Ming 2 has written the theater play \"Razza Partigiana\" in 2013; he is also participating on stage, with musical support from Paul Pieretto, Federico Oppi (Settlefish) and Egle Sommacal (Massimo Volume). The plot follows the story of Giorgio Marincola, a partisan from World War II, a dark-skinned Italian who is the son of a Somalian mother and an Italian father, born in 1923 near Mogadishu.\n\nWu Ming 5 was guitar player in , one of the first Oi! bands to reach a cult following in Italy during the early 1980s. The band broke up in 1987 but got together again in the early 1990s, only to break up again in 1998. Nabat reunited in 2010 for a comeback tour, with Wu Ming 5 still on guitar, \"splitting services between two bands [Wu Ming and Nabat]\", as he quipped during a radio interview.\n\nThe group has published several novels and non-fiction books in print and online, released under a Creative Commons license, and they are available for download on the group's website. Only \"Q\", \"54\", \"Manituana\" and \"Altai\" have been translated into English, whereas most books are available in several European languages.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
