{"id": "207009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=207009", "title": "Cohousing", "text": "Cohousing\n\nCohousing is an intentional community of private homes clustered around shared space. Each attached or single family home has traditional amenities, including a private kitchen. Shared spaces typically feature a common house, which may include a large kitchen and dining area, laundry, and recreational spaces. Shared outdoor space may include parking, walkways, open space, and gardens. Neighbors also share resources like tools and lawnmowers.\n\nHouseholds have independent incomes and private lives, but neighbors collaboratively plan and manage community activities and shared spaces. The legal structure is typically a homeowner association or housing cooperative. Community activities feature regularly-scheduled shared meals, meetings, and workdays. Neighbors gather for parties, games, movies, or other events. Cohousing makes it easy to form clubs, organize child and elder care, and carpool.\n\nCohousing facilitates interaction among neighbors and thereby provides social, practical, economic, and environmental benefits.\n\nCohousing communities generally share a set of common characteristics.\n\nCohousing communities are usually structured - in principle and often in architecture - to encourage frequent interactions and the formation of close relationships between their members. Neighbors are encouraged to cooperate within the community and to care for their neighbors. Cohousing developments are usually intentionally limited to around 20-40 homes and frequently feature large common areas for residents to interact in.\n\nWhile cohousing developments are designed to encourage community, residents usually still have as much personal privacy as they want. Residents are able to choose how much they engage in order to find the right balance between their privacy and the community.\n\nDecision making in cohousing communities is often based on forming a consensus within the community. Residents have shared space which they can all use, usually saving money; however, residents can still manage their own space to appeal to them.\n\nThe modern theory of cohousing originated in Denmark in the 1960s among groups of families who were dissatisfied with existing housing and communities that they felt did not meet their needs. Bodil Graae wrote a newspaper article titled \"Children Should Have One Hundred Parents,\" spurring a group of 50 families to organize around a community project in 1967. This group developed the cohousing project Sættedammen, which is the oldest known modern cohousing community. Another key organizer was Jan Gudmand Høyer who drew inspiration from his architectural studies at Harvard and interaction with experimental U.S. communities of the era. He published the article \"The Missing Link between Utopia and the Dated Single Family House\" in 1968, converging a second group.\n\nThe Danish term \"bofællesskab\" (living community) was introduced to North America as \"cohousing\" by two American architects, Kathryn McCamant and Charles Durrett, who visited several cohousing communities and wrote a book about it. The book resonated with some existing and forming communities, such as Sharingwood in Washington state and N Street in California, who embraced the cohousing concept as a crystallization of what they were already about. Though most cohousing groups seek to develop multi-generational communities, some focus on creating senior communities. Charles Durrett later wrote a handbook on creating senior cohousing. The first community in the United States to be designed, constructed and occupied specifically for cohousing is Muir Commons in Davis, California. Architects, Kathryn McCamant and Charles Durrett were responsible for the programming and the design of the site plan, common house and private houses.\n\nThere are precedents for cohousing in the 1920s in New York with the cooperative apartment housing with shared facilities and good social interaction. The Siheyuan, or quadrangle design of housing in China has a shared courtyard and is thus similar in some respects to cohousing.\n\nCohousing communities are part of the new cooperative economy in the United States and are predicted to expand rapidly in the next few decades as individuals and families seek to live more sustainably, and in community with neighbors. Since the first cohousing community was completed in the U.S. – Muir Commons in Davis, California, now celebrating 25 years – more than 160 communities have been established in 25 states plus the District of Columbia, with more than 125 in process. For a listing of cohousing communities visit www.cohousing.org/directory. Most cohousing communities are intergenerational with both children and elders; in recent years, senior cohousing focused on older adult needs have grown. These communities come in a variety, but are often environment friendly and socially sustainable.\n\nHundreds of cohousing communities exist in Denmark and other countries in northern Europe. In Canada, there are 11 completed communities, and approximately 19 in the forming or development phase (see ). There are more than 300 cohousing communities in the Netherlands (73 mixed-generation and 231 senior cohousing), with about 60 others in planning or construction phases.\n\nThere are also communities in Australia (see Cohousing Australia), the United Kingdom (see UK Cohousing Network http://www.cohousing.org.uk for information, Threshold Centre Cohousing Community http://www.thresholdcentre.org.uk/ offers training), and other parts of the world.\n\nCohousing started to develop in the UK at the end of the 1990s. The movement has gradually built up momentum and there are now 14 purpose built cohousing communities. A further 40+ cohousing groups are developing projects and new groups are forming all the time. Cohousing communities in the UK range from around 8 households to around 30 households. Most communities are mixed communities with single people, couples and families but some are only for people over 50 and one is only for women over 50 years. The communities themselves range from new developments built to modern eco standards to conversions of everything from farms to Jacobean mansions to former hospital buildings and are in urban, rural and semi- rural locations.\n\nBecause each cohousing community is planned in its context, a key feature of this model is its flexibility to the needs and values of its residents and the characteristics of the site. Cohousing can be urban, suburban or rural. The physical form is typically compact but varies from low-rise apartments to townhouses to clustered detached houses. They tend to keep cars to the periphery which promotes walking through the community and interacting with neighbors as well as increasing safety for children at play within the community. Shared green space is another characteristic, whether for gardening, play, or places to gather. When more land is available than is needed for the physical structures, the structures are usually clustered closely together, leaving as much of the land as possible \"open\" for shared use. This aspect of cohousing directly addresses the growing problem of suburban sprawl.\n\nIn addition to \"from-scratch\" new-built communities (including those physically retrofitting/re-using existing structures), there are also \"retrofit\" (aka \"organic\") communities in which neighbors create \"intentional neighborhoods\" by buying adjacent properties and removing fences. Often, they create common amenities such as Common Houses after the fact, while living there. N Street Cohousing in Davis, CA, is the canonical example of this type; it came together before the term Cohousing was popularized in the United States.\n\nCohousing differs from some types of intentional communities in that the residents do not have a shared economy or a common set of beliefs or religion, but instead invest in creating a socially rich and interconnected community. A non-hierarchical structure employing a consensus decision-making model is common in managing cohousing. Individuals do take on leadership roles, such as being responsible for coordinating a garden or facilitating a meeting.\n\nCohousing communities in the U.S. currently rely on one of two existing legal forms of real estate ownership: individually titled houses with common areas owned by a homeowner association(condominium)s or a housing cooperative. Condo ownership is most common because it fits financial institutions' and cities' models for multi-unit owner-occupied housing development. U.S. banks lend more readily on single-family homes and condominiums than housing cooperatives. Charles Durrett points out that rental cohousing is a very likely future model, as it already is being practiced in Europe.\n\nCohousing differs from standard condominium development and master-planned subdivisions because the development is designed by, or with considerable input from, its future residents. The design process invariably emphasizes consciously fostering social relationships among its residents. Common facilities are based on the actual needs of the residents, rather than on what a developer thinks will help sell units. Turnover in cohousing developments is typically very low, and there is usually a waiting list for units to become available.\n\nIn Europe the term \"joint building ventures\" has been coined to define the form of ownership and housing characterized as cohousing. According to the European Urban Knowledge Network (EUKN): \"Joint building ventures are a legal federation of persons willing to build who want to create owner-occupied housing and to participate actively in planning and building.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is one of 162 \"German Student Corps\" in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, Latvia and Hungary today. The Corps is a member of the Weinheimer Senioren-Convent (WSC), the second oldest federation of classical European fraternal corporations, with roots dating back to the 15th century and fraternities founded in several European countries.\n\nMembership in the fraternity is open to honorable men studying at one of Aachen's universities and is based exclusively on personality, good moral standing, and strength of character. Members of the Corps Marko-Guestphalia value and engage in the tradition of academic fencing as a way to sharpen and prove their character under pressure. Continuing a practice dating back into the 1700s, Marko-Guestphalia's members wear the traditional couleur, colored stripes, in green-white-black. The fraternity teaches and expects tolerance from its members, stemming from diverse ethnic, national, religious and political backgrounds. While many of their members stem from the west-Rhine region of Germany, Marko-Guestphalia enjoys a strong membership of international students (examples include Denmark, India, Italia, Serbia, Turkey, USA, Peru), similar to the internationally very open character of the RWTH.\n\nLike all \"German Student Corps\", Marko-Guestphalia expects tolerance from its members in political, scientific and religious affairs. Members are encouraged to have their own point of view about the world and be able to argue it, but Marko-Guestphalia as an entity always remains neutral. This \"neutrality\" is a fundamental pillar of all Corps and differentiates them from fraternities who require a certain political or religious affinity. The fraternity encourages freshly admitted (pledging \"fox\") members with diverse ethnic, national, religious and political backgrounds to prove themselves as valuable Corps brothers, purely on the basis of personal character and merit, before becoming eligible to be fully incorporated (\"Rezeption\"). The fraternity has about 300 members of all ages (including alumni) coming from or currently residing in Europe, Asia, the Americas and Africa. Every full member is a member for life.\nMembers of the Corps Marko-Guestphalia value and practice the tradition of engagements in \"academic fencing\", or \"Mensur\" in German, with members of other old-school fraternities. Academic fencing, originating in the German school of fencing, is understood as a way to exercise good judgement and prove character, allowing participants to show determination by standing their ground under pressure, while enhancing the bonds between the Corps brothers at the same time. Mark Twain described one of these fencing duels/challenges in his day and age; his description is remarkably similar to current practices. Marko-Guestphalia's members identify themselves wearing the traditional \"couleur\", colored stripes, as well as caps and/or other specific garments at official occasions. This tradition, known as \"wearing colors\" (German: \"Farben tragen\"), provides means to recognize members of other fraternities and, likewise, identification for the Corps brothers with each other and their traditions.\n\n\"Activity\" and \"responsibility\" are two fundamental expectations for fraternity members. With the goal to achieve members who are prepared to become active leaders in society, every Corps brother is expected to hold a leadership position at least once for a term (\"Semester\") while a student. Members are further encouraged to organize internal and open fraternity events that draw attention from other fraternities and guests from industry, academia, politics and other active societies. Allocating the necessary resources appropriately and living up to set expectations teaches responsibility. All members must show active participation in the regular fraternity Convents, providing the foundation for the fraternity's members to meet and discuss past, present and future developments. Decisions are cast in a democratic manner, sometimes after intense debates. Participation at such Convents teaches a better understanding of proper argumentation, group dynamics and critical analysis of other members' views, plans and arguments, thereby preparing its participants to become active members of society. Similarly, every member must finish his higher educational degree with good academic standing in order to advance to the status of \"Alter Herr\" (alumnus).\n\nLong-term guidance is expected from and provided by said \"Alte Herren\", who often remain very engaged and well connected with the fraternity. Every year at the end of May, student and alumni members of all German Student Corps meet in one of two cities (Weinheim and Bad Kösen) for three days to refresh their bonds with their fraternity and friends from the entire Corps network (WSC/KSCV). In addition to these international meetings once a year, alumni join the student members for multiple local meetings, lasting an evening or a weekend. These regular meetings result in strong bonds spanning the generations within the fraternity.\n\nThe fraternity was founded by three fraternity students of other fraternities on December 2, 1871 who had come to the Royal Rheinian-Westphalian Polytechnical School at Aachen for their graduate studies. The fraternity grew quickly and joined the Weinheimer Senioren-Convent (WSC) on May 17, 1872.\n\nThe fraternity has official relationships with the Corps Saxo-Thuringia München in Munich and a close relationship with the other Corps of the \"Blaues Kartell\" with member fraternities Corps Altsachsen Dresden, Corps Hannoverania Hanover and Corps Berlin.\n\n"}
{"id": "25243147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25243147", "title": "Cosmos and Psyche", "text": "Cosmos and Psyche\n\nCosmos and Psyche: Intimations of a New World View is a 2006 book by cultural historian Richard Tarnas, in which the author proposes the existence of relationships between planetary transits and events in the lives of major historical figures, as well as cultural events.\n\nTarnas's first book, \"The Passion of the Western Mind\" serves as an introduction to \"Cosmos and Psyche\". Tarnas acknowledges that astrology's status in contemporary thought is, as he puts it, \"the gold standard for superstition\".\n\nThe book's objective is to challenge the materialistic and dysteleological assumptions of the modern world view, and to set forth evidence for a correspondence between planetary alignments and patterns of human history. The book attempts to provide an archetypal cosmology to accompany Tarnas's proposed participatory epistemology, \"in which human beings are regarded as an essential vehicle for the creative selfunfolding of reality\".\n\nThe idea for \"Cosmos and Psyche\" began when Tarnas realized that the climax of the 1960s cultural revolution took place precisely during the only Uranus-Pluto conjunction in the 20th century. For Tarnas, the characteristics of the astrological entity Uranus match with those of the Greek mythical figure Prometheus better than with those of the conservative mythological figure Uranus. Tarnas associates the astrological planet Uranus with freedom and change, while Pluto is associated with evolution, instinct, and \"eros\". Thus in Tarnas's theory, the apparent relationships (conjunctions, oppositions, and squares) of Uranus and Pluto have momentous potential for human history. (Tarnas's research has not found significant correlation between the zodiac signs and human events.) Tarnas further observed that a Uranus-Pluto opposition occurred during the French Revolution. Like the 1960s, the French Revolution featured the characteristics of Uranus-Pluto alignment: revolution through the manifestation of the suppressed. These historical-astrological coincidences or synchronicities led Tarnas to further explore the relationship of pivotal moments in Western cultural history to the conjunctions, oppositions, and squares of the outer planets. The historical events analyzed include the Reformation, the Renaissance, Romanticism, the Scientific Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, Modernism, Postmodernism, etc.\n\nIn the book Tarnas discusses the correspondences between planetary transits and the biographies of such figures as Friedrich Nietzsche, William Blake, Walt Whitman, and Arthur Schopenhauer. Tarnas believes that the correspondences between historical events and astrological alignments are consistently astonishing.\n\nTarnas uses C. G. Jung's concept of synchronicity, or meaningful coincidence, to argue that there is an acausal connection between the outer world and the human psyche.\n\nTarnas does not argue for a causal relationship between the planets and human events:In the perspective I am suggesting here, reflecting the dominant trend in contemporary astrological theory, the planets do not \"cause\" specific events any more than the hands on a clock \"cause\" a specific time. Rather, the planetary positions are indicative of the cosmic state or archetypal dynamics at that time.\n\nThomas Meaney panned \"Cosmos and Psyche\" in \"The Wall Street Journal\", writing that the premise may sound \"like an elaborate joke\". Calling it \"unadulterated crack-pottery\", he wrote that Tarnas's observations were vacuous, opining that they \"...drain human events of meaning rather than fill them with significance.\"\n\nOther reviews were more positive. In \"Inside Bay Area\", Esther Fields opined that \"...[n]ot only does it challenge modern assumptions about how the world works, but it also points the way toward a new way of understanding your place in the cosmos...and shows how we are on the brink of world changes as great as those of the time of Galileo and Copernicus.\" Anthroposophist Frederick Dennehy opined in \"Lilipoh\" magazine that \"Tarnas’ deeply radical hypothesis is that the disenchantment of the modern universe is unreal – the result of a “simplistic epistemology” and moral positioning totally inadequate to the depths, complexity and grandeur of the cosmos.\"\n\nIn \"The Observer\", astrologer Neil Spencer favorably contrasted Tarnas's book \"Cosmos and Psyche\" to the writings of Richard Dawkins:\n'In effect, the objective world has been ruled by the Enlightenment, the subjective world by Romanticism,' Richard Tarnas says in his remarkable book Cosmos & Psyche, an attempt to heal that schism, to 're-enchant' the cosmos and redeem what he calls the 'pathos' of the modern condition. By contrast, Dawkins' one-eyed view turns reason, as Blake warned, into the enemy of imagination and of art. John Heron critiqued the methodology and conclusions of \"Cosmos\" in the journal \"Network Review\", describing 18 internal problems with Tarnas' theory. In the following issue of \"Network Review\", Keiron Le Grice responded point-by-point to Heron's critique. Rob Brezsny, American astrologer, opined that \"Cosmos and Psyche\" is \"the definitive astrology book of the 21st century—probably the 20th century, too.\"\n\nIn \"Tikkun\" magazine Jordi Pigem opined, In the last ten years, landmark works...have been reflecting and kindling a growing awareness that nature is not merely a sum of molecules obeying physical and chemical laws, but a living, sensuous, and ensouled matrix in which we fully participate and belong. Tarnas' \"Cosmos and Psyche\" extends this rising awareness beyond the bounds of the biosphere. Our psyche is not only deeply connected with our immediate natural environment, but with the whole of the cosmos encompassing us, with the rhythms of the planets we can see above us on clear nights. Searching beneath the depths of the psyche, Tarnas has found the heights of the cosmos. \"Cosmos and Psyche\" may radically transform the way we see cultural and political history, individual life journeys, and our sense of participation in the universe. Daniel Pinchbeck, writing in \"Reality Sandwich\", opined that \"Cosmos\" was \"scrupulously researched and carefully argued\", and that it advances \"a radical thesis...which seeks to revive astrology as a serious intellectual discipline and provide a cosmological missing link between the human world and the greater universe in which we are embedded.\" Pinchbeck writes that \"Cosmos\" may offer \"a transformative matrix for reconceiving our relationship to the cosmos.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "27038201", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27038201", "title": "Death and the Internet", "text": "Death and the Internet\n\nA recent extension to the cultural relationship with death is the increasing number of people who die having created a large amount of digital content, such as social media profiles, that will remain after death. This may result in concern and confusion, because of automated features of dormant accounts (e.g. birthday reminders), uncertainty of the deceased's preferences that profiles be deleted or left as a memorial, and whether information that may violate the deceased's privacy (such as email or browser history) should be made accessible to family.\n\nIssues with how this information is sensitively dealt with are further complicated as it may belong to the service provider (not the deceased) and many do not have clear policies on what happens to the accounts of deceased users. While some sites, including Facebook and Twitter, have policies related to death, others remain dormant until deleted due to inactivity or transferred to family or friends. It is expected that the accounts of deceased people will outnumber those of active users unless providers include specific policies and accounts' management tools.\n\nGmail and Hotmail allow the email accounts of the deceased to be accessed, provided certain requirements are met. Yahoo! Mail will not provide access, citing the No Right of Survivorship and Non-Transferability clause in the Yahoo! terms of service. In 2005 Yahoo! was ordered by the Probate Court of Oakland County, Michigan, to release emails of deceased US Marine Justin Ellsworth to his father, John Ellsworth.\n\nFacebook's policy on death is to turn the deceased user's profile into a memorial, \"as a place where people can save and share their memories of those who've passed.\" Memorializing of a profile involves: the deceased user no longer showing up in the \"Suggestions\" box on the right-hand side of the homepage; the privacy setting is altered so that only confirmed friends can view the profile and search for it; contact information and status updates are removed; no one is able to log into the account in the future. Deletion of an account entails the complete removal of the deceased user's data from the online platform, however Facebook holds the legal right to sustain the user's credentials for up to 90 days after request of deletion.\n\nIn order to memorialize a deceased person's account, a special contact form must be filled out. In this contact form, a proof of death must be provided, such as an obituary or news article. Both family members and non-family members are allowed to submit this form.\n\nThe general terms of service for Dropbox state that inactive accounts will be deleted after 90 days since the last login. Access to the account of a deceased individual may be requested by providing verification that the person is deceased and the applicant has a legal right to access their files (such as a court order).\n\nIn April 2013, Google announced the creation of the 'Inactive Account Manager', which allows users of Google services to set up a process in which ownership and control of inactive accounts is transferred to a delegated user.\n\nGoogle also allows users to submit a range of requests regarding accounts belonging to deceased users. Google can work with immediate family members and representatives to close online accounts in some cases once a user is known to be deceased, and in certain circumstances may provide content from a deceased user's account.\n\nMySpace will allow a memorial to be set up to honor deceased users.\n\nUpon request, Twitter can close accounts and provide archives of public tweets for deceased users. Family members are required to submit a formal request to Twitter's Trust and Safety department. They must have a copy of the death certificate or Twitter will not take action despite obituary articles and news clips.\nThis has changed and now Twitter only allows account deactivation for the deceased.\n\nUsers who have made at least several hundred edits or are otherwise known for substantial contributions to Wikipedia can be noted at a . Wikipedia user pages are ordinarily fully edit-protected after the user has died, to prevent vandalism.\n\nYouTube grants access to accounts of deceased persons under certain conditions. It is one of the data options that one can select to give access to a trusted contact with Google's Inactive Account Manager.\n\n\"Digital inheritance\" is the process of handing over (personal) digital assets to (human) beneficiaries. These digital assets include digital estates and the right to use them. It may include bank accounts, writings, photographs, and social interactions.\n\nThere are several services that offer to keep multiple passwords, sending them to people of personal choice after death. Some of these send the customer an email from time to time, prompting to confirm that that person is still alive, and failure to respond to multiple emails makes the service provider to assume that the person has deceased, and will thereafter give out the passwords as previously requested. The \"Data Inheritance\" function from SecureSafe gives an \"activator code\" that the customer will hand to another trustworthy person of personal choice, and in the event of death that person then enters the code into Secure Safe's system to get access to the deceased person's digital inheritance. Legacy Locker and SafeBeyond require two verifiers who both must confirm the death, as well as providing a death certificate, before any passwords will be handed out.\n\nFor those who are paranoid about their online Privacy, platforms like LifeBank offer a helpful secure capability to store all internet account passwords offline whilst ensuring that a trusted person is given permission to access the individual's LifeBank when they die. This gives the inheritor the ability to access and edit accounts, including deleting information or indeed the entire account.\n\n\n"}

Until, June 6, 2018, it used to be held annually on May 29. It was a tradition that held for 18 years, beginning in 2000. It now holds on June 12.\n\nMay 29, celebrated as Nigeria's Democracy Day, was a public holiday to commemorate the restoration of democracy in the Federal Republic of Nigeria, when the newly elected Olusegun Obasanjo took office as the President of Nigeria in May 1999 ending multiple decades of military rule that began in 1966 and had been interrupted only by a brief period of democracy from 1979 to 1983.\n\nOn June 6, 2018, eight days after May 29, 2018 had been celebrated as Democracy Day, the President Buhari-led Federal Government of Nigeria declared June 12 to be the new Democracy Day. This was done to commemorate the democratic election of MKO Abiola on June 12, 1993, in what has been adjudged to be Nigeria's freest and fairest elections. It was, however, cancelled by the Ibrahim Babangida Junta.\n\nAfter gaining independence in 1960 from Great Britain, Nigeria fell prey to civil war and the first of so many military coups in 1966. Democracy was briefly restored from 1979 to 1983 to the country, but for most of its independent history, Nigeria was ruled by a series of military juntas. The last major military ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha, died suddenly in 1998. His successor, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar promised a transition to democracy, and accordingly a new constitution was adopted on May 5th, 1999. Elections were held and retired Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, who had previously governed Nigeria as a military ruler, was elected the new president. \n\nThe end of military rule brought about a new era of regular elections as well as the return of civil liberties, free press and an end to arbitrary arrests and torture, although human rights violations still occur regularly. Nigeria also began a long campaign against the bureaucratic and military corruption that had paralyzed its economy and severely tarnished its international reputation.\n\n"}

They are considered to be gods offering both protection and fertility and were placed outside of gates for protection against demons travelling between realities.\n\nDol hareubangs are carved from porous basalt (volcanic rock) and can be up to three metres high. The statues' faces feature grinning expressions, bulging eyes without pupils, a long, broad nose, and slight smile, and their hands rest on their bellies, one slightly above the other. In sets of two, one has a higher left hand, and the other a higher right hand. The hat is commonly described as phallic or mushroom-like.\n\nThe name \"dol hareubang\" derives from the Korean word for \"stone\" (\"dol\" 돌), plus the Jeju dialect word \"hareubang\" (하르방), meaning \"grandfather\" or \"senior\" (\"harabeoji\" [할아버지] in Standard Korean), and was coined in the mid-20th century. Other earlier names for the statues include \"beoksumeori\", \"museongmok\", and \"useongmok\". \"Beoksumeori\", meaning shaman head, is used in the former area of Jeongui \"Hyeon\" (county), \"museongmok\" in Daejeong Hyeon and Jeongui Hyeon, and \"useongmok\" only in Jeju Hyeon. Historically, the \"Tamna Chronicles\" called them \"ongjungseok\" (옹중석/翁仲石), but this usage is unknown today.\n\nThere are three main theories as to the origin of \"dol hareubangs\": either that they were introduced by visitors from the sea, that they are a counterpart to the \"jangseungs\" (totem poles) of mainland Korea, or that they spread with shamanic mushroom culture. \"Jangseungs\" are also called \"beoksu\" in southern Korea, and this similarity with the name \"beoksumeori\" lends credence to the second theory.\nAccording to the \"Tamnaji\" a work dealing with the geography of Jejudo, the first dolhareubang was manufactured in 1754. \"Dol hareubangs\" produced from 1763 to 1765 once stood outside the eastern, western, and southern gates of the Jeju City fortress as guardian deities.\n\nIn 2014, a Korea Aerospace University Professor Woo Sil-ha found a Chinese seokinsang (石人像, stone man statue) strikingly similar to \"dol hareubang\" in the Jianping Museum, Chaoyang, Liaoning, China. The seokinsang which is of Chinese Liao dynasty (907–1125) was discovered in December 2011 in Heishui, Jianping County, Liaoning, China. The Professor said that the origin of \"dol hareubang\" requires re-examination.\n\n\"Dol hareubangs\" have become the symbol of Jeju Island, and replicas of various sizes are sold as tourist souvenirs. The statues are sometimes sold as sources of fertility, and small replicas are sometimes given to women with fertility problems. The origin of this may have more to do with Jeju Do's present-day status as a \"honeymoon island\" than tradition.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20913753", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20913753", "title": "Drama", "text": "Drama\n\nDrama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance: a play, opera, mime, ballet, etc, performed in a theatre, or on radio or television. Considered as a genre of poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's \"Poetics\" (c. 335 BC)—the earliest work of dramatic theory.\nThe term \"drama\" comes from a Greek word meaning \"action\" (Classical Greek: , \"drama\"), which is derived from \"I do\" (Classical Greek: , \"drao\"). The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy. \n\nIn English (as was the analogous case in many other European languages), the word \"play\" or \"game\" (translating the Anglo-Saxon \"pleġan\" or Latin \"ludus\") was the standard term used to describe drama until William Shakespeare's time—just as its creator was a \"play-maker\" rather than a \"dramatist\" and the building was a \"play-house\" rather than a \"theatre\". \n\nThe use of \"drama\" in a more narrow sense to designate a specific \"type\" of play dates from the modern era. \"Drama\" in this sense refers to a play that is \"neither\" a comedy nor a tragedy—for example, Zola's \"Thérèse Raquin\" (1873) or Chekhov's \"Ivanov\" (1887). It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries, along with film studies, adopted to describe \"drama\" as a genre within their respective media. \"Radio drama\" has been used in both senses—originally transmitted in a live performance, it has also been used to describe the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio.\n\nThe enactment of drama in theatre, performed by actors on a stage before an audience, presupposes collaborative modes of production and a collective form of reception. The structure of dramatic texts, unlike other forms of literature, is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception. \n\nMime is a form of drama where the action of a story is told only through the movement of the body. Drama can be combined with music: the dramatic text in opera is generally sung throughout; as for in some ballets dance \"expresses or imitates emotion, character, and narrative action\". Musicals include both spoken dialogue and songs; and some forms of drama have incidental music or musical accompaniment underscoring the dialogue (melodrama and Japanese Nō, for example). Closet drama describes a form that is intended to be read, rather than performed. In improvisation, the drama does not pre-exist the moment of performance; performers devise a dramatic script spontaneously before an audience.\n\nWestern drama originates in classical Greece. The theatrical culture of the city-state of Athens produced three genres of drama: tragedy, comedy, and the satyr play. Their origins remain obscure, though by the 5th century BC they were institutionalised in competitions held as part of festivities celebrating the god Dionysus. Historians know the names of many ancient Greek dramatists, not least Thespis, who is credited with the innovation of an actor (\"\"hypokrites\") who speaks (rather than sings) and impersonates a character (rather than speaking in his own person), while interacting with the chorus and its leader (\"coryphaeus\"\"), who were a traditional part of the performance of non-dramatic poetry (dithyrambic, lyric and epic).\n\nOnly a small fraction of the work of five dramatists, however, has survived to this day: we have a small number of complete texts by the tragedians Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides, and the comic writers Aristophanes and, from the late 4th century, Menander. Aeschylus' historical tragedy \"The Persians\" is the oldest surviving drama, although when it won first prize at the City Dionysia competition in 472 BC, he had been writing plays for more than 25 years. The competition (\"\"agon\") for tragedies may have begun as early as 534 BC; official records (\"didaskaliai\"\") begin from 501 BC when the satyr play was introduced. Tragic dramatists were required to present a tetralogy of plays (though the individual works were not necessarily connected by story or theme), which usually consisted of three tragedies and one satyr play (though exceptions were made, as with Euripides' \"Alcestis\" in 438 BC). Comedy was officially recognized with a prize in the competition from 487 to 486 BC.\n\nFive comic dramatists competed at the City Dionysia (though during the Peloponnesian War this may have been reduced to three), each offering a single comedy. Ancient Greek comedy is traditionally divided between \"old comedy\" (5th century BC), \"middle comedy\" (4th century BC) and \"new comedy\" (late 4th century to 2nd BC).\n\nFollowing the expansion of the Roman Republic (509–27 BC) into several Greek territories between 270–240 BC, Rome encountered Greek drama. From the later years of the republic and by means of the Roman Empire (27 BC-476 AD), theatre spread west across Europe, around the Mediterranean and reached England; Roman theatre was more varied, extensive and sophisticated than that of any culture before it.\n\nWhile Greek drama continued to be performed throughout the Roman period, the year 240 BC marks the beginning of regular Roman drama. From the beginning of the empire, however, interest in full-length drama declined in favour of a broader variety of theatrical entertainments. The first important works of Roman literature were the tragedies and comedies that Livius Andronicus wrote from 240 BC. Five years later, Gnaeus Naevius also began to write drama. No plays from either writer have survived. While both dramatists composed in both genres, Andronicus was most appreciated for his tragedies and Naevius for his comedies; their successors tended to specialise in one or the other, which led to a separation of the subsequent development of each type of drama.\n\nBy the beginning of the 2nd century BC, drama was firmly established in Rome and a guild of writers (\"collegium poetarum\") had been formed. The Roman comedies that have survived are all \"fabula palliata\" (comedies based on Greek subjects) and come from two dramatists: Titus Maccius Plautus (Plautus) and Publius Terentius Afer (Terence). In re-working the Greek originals, the Roman comic dramatists abolished the role of the chorus in dividing the drama into episodes and introduced musical accompaniment to its dialogue (between one-third of the dialogue in the comedies of Plautus and two-thirds in those of Terence). The action of all scenes is set in the exterior location of a street and its complications often follow from eavesdropping.\n\nPlautus, the more popular of the two, wrote between 205 and 184 BC and twenty of his comedies survive, of which his farces are best known; he was admired for the wit of his dialogue and his use of a variety of poetic meters. All of the six comedies that Terence wrote between 166 and 160 BC have survived; the complexity of his plots, in which he often combined several Greek originals, was sometimes denounced, but his double-plots enabled a sophisticated presentation of contrasting human behaviour. No early Roman tragedy survives, though it was highly regarded in its day; historians know of three early tragedians—Quintus Ennius, Marcus Pacuvius, and Lucius Accius.\n\nFrom the time of the empire, the work of two tragedians survives—one is an unknown author, while the other is the Stoic philosopher Seneca. Nine of Seneca's tragedies survive, all of which are \"fabula crepidata\" (tragedies adapted from Greek originals); his \"Phaedra\", for example, was based on Euripides' \"Hippolytus\". Historians do not know who wrote the only extant example of the \"fabula praetexta\" (tragedies based on Roman subjects), \"Octavia\", but in former times it was mistakenly attributed to Seneca due to his appearance as a character in the tragedy.\n\nBeginning in the early Middle Ages, churches staged dramatised versions of biblical events, known as liturgical dramas, to enliven annual celebrations. The earliest example is the Easter trope \"Whom do you Seek? (Quem-Quaeritis)\" (c. 925). Two groups would sing responsively in Latin, though no impersonation of characters was involved. By the 11th century, it had spread through Europe to Russia, Scandinavia, and Italy; excluding Islamic-era Spain.\n\nIn the 10th century, Hrosvitha wrote six plays in Latin modeled on Terence's comedies, but which treated religious subjects. Her plays are the first known to be composed by a female dramatist and the first identifiable Western drama of the post-Classical era. Later, Hildegard of Bingen wrote a musical drama, \"Ordo Virtutum\" (c. 1155).\n\nOne of the most famous of the early secular plays is the courtly pastoral \"Robin and Marion\", written in the 13th century in French by Adam de la Halle. \"The Interlude of the Student and the Girl\" (c. 1300), one of the earliest known in English, seems to be the closest in tone and form to the contemporaneous French farces, such as \"The Boy and the Blind Man.\"\n\nA large number of plays survive from France and Germany in the late Middle Ages, when some type of religious drama was performed in nearly every European country. Many of these plays contained comedy, devils, villains, and clowns. In England, trade guilds began to perform vernacular \"mystery plays,\" which were composed of long cycles of a large number of playlets or \"pageants,\" of which four are extant: York (48 plays), Chester (24), Wakefield (32) and the so-called \"N-Town\" (42). \"The Second Shepherds' Play\" from the Wakefield cycle is a farcical story of a stolen sheep that its protagonist, Mak, tries to pass off as his new-born child asleep in a crib; it ends when the shepherds from whom he has stolen are summoned to the Nativity of Jesus.\n\nMorality plays (a modern term) emerged as a distinct dramatic form around 1400 and flourished in the early Elizabethan era in England. Characters were often used to represent different ethical ideals. \"Everyman\", for example, includes such figures as Good Deeds, Knowledge and Strength, and this characterisation reinforces the conflict between good and evil for the audience. \"The Castle of Perseverance\" (c. 1400—1425) depicts an archetypal figure's progress from birth through to death. \"Horestes\" (c. 1567), a late \"hybrid morality\" and one of the earliest examples of an English revenge play, brings together the classical story of Orestes with a Vice from the medieval allegorical tradition, alternating comic, slapstick scenes with serious, tragic ones. Also important in this period were the folk dramas of the Mummers Play, performed during the Christmas season. Court masques were particularly popular during the reign of Henry VIII.\n\nOne of the great flowerings of drama in England occurred in the 16th and 17th centuries. Many of these plays were written in verse, particularly iambic pentameter. In addition to Shakespeare, such authors as Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Middleton, and Ben Jonson were prominent playwrights during this period. As in the medieval period, historical plays celebrated the lives of past kings, enhancing the image of the Tudor monarchy. Authors of this period drew some of their storylines from Greek mythology and Roman mythology or from the plays of eminent Roman playwrights such as Plautus and Terence.\n\nRestoration comedy refers to English comedies written and performed in England during the Restoration period from 1660 to 1710. Comedy of manners is used as a synonym of Restoration comedy. After public theatre had been banned by the Puritan regime, the re-opening of the theatres in 1660 with the Restoration of Charles II signalled a renaissance of English drama. Restoration comedy is known for its sexual explicitness, urbane, cosmopolitan wit, up-to-the-minute topical writing, and crowded and bustling plots. Its dramatists stole freely from the contemporary French and Spanish stage, from English Jacobean and Caroline plays, and even from Greek and Roman classical comedies, combining the various plotlines in adventurous ways. Resulting differences of tone in a single play were appreciated rather than frowned on, as the audience prized \"variety\" within as well as between plays. Restoration comedy peaked twice. The genre came to spectacular maturity in the mid-1670s with an extravaganza of aristocratic comedies. Twenty lean years followed this short golden age, although the achievement of the first professional female playwright, Aphra Behn, in the 1680s is an important exception. In the mid-1690s, a brief second Restoration comedy renaissance arose, aimed at a wider audience. The comedies of the golden 1670s and 1690s peak times are significantly different from each other.\n\nThe unsentimental or \"hard\" comedies of John Dryden, William Wycherley, and George Etherege reflected the atmosphere at Court and celebrated with frankness an aristocratic macho lifestyle of unremitting sexual intrigue and conquest. The Earl of Rochester, real-life Restoration rake, courtier and poet, is flatteringly portrayed in Etherege's \"The Man of Mode\" (1676) as a riotous, witty, intellectual, and sexually irresistible aristocrat, a template for posterity's idea of the glamorous Restoration rake (actually never a very common character in Restoration comedy). The single play that does most to support the charge of obscenity levelled then and now at Restoration comedy is probably Wycherley's masterpiece \"The Country Wife\" (1675), whose title contains a lewd pun and whose notorious \"china scene\" is a series of sustained double entendres.\n\nDuring the second wave of Restoration comedy in the 1690s, the \"softer\" comedies of William Congreve and John Vanbrugh set out to appeal to more socially diverse audience with a strong middle-class element, as well as to female spectators. The comic focus shifts from young lovers outwitting the older generation to the vicissitudes of marital relations. In Congreve's \"Love for Love\" (1695) and \"The Way of the World\" (1700), the give-and-take set pieces of couples testing their attraction for one another have mutated into witty prenuptial debates on the eve of marriage, as in the latter's famous \"Proviso\" scene. Vanbrugh's \"The Provoked Wife\" (1697) has a light touch and more humanly recognisable characters, while \"The Relapse\" (1696) has been admired for its throwaway wit and the characterisation of Lord Foppington, an extravagant and affected burlesque fop with a dark side. The tolerance for Restoration comedy even in its modified form was running out by the end of the 17th century, as public opinion turned to respectability and seriousness even faster than the playwrights did. At the much-anticipated all-star première in 1700 of \"The Way of the World\", Congreve's first comedy for five years, the audience showed only moderate enthusiasm for that subtle and almost melancholy work. The comedy of sex and wit was about to be replaced by sentimental comedy and the drama of exemplary morality.\n\nThe pivotal and innovative contributions of the 19th-century Norwegian dramatist Henrik Ibsen and the 20th-century German theatre practitioner Bertolt Brecht dominate modern drama; each inspired a tradition of imitators, which include many of the greatest playwrights of the modern era. The works of both playwrights are, in their different ways, both modernist and realist, incorporating formal experimentation, meta-theatricality, and social critique. In terms of the traditional theoretical discourse of genre, Ibsen's work has been described as the culmination of \"liberal tragedy\", while Brecht's has been aligned with an historicised comedy.\n\nOther important playwrights of the modern era include Antonin Artaud, August Strindberg, Anton Chekhov, Frank Wedekind, Maurice Maeterlinck, Federico García Lorca, Eugene O'Neill, Luigi Pirandello, George Bernard Shaw, Ernst Toller, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams, Jean Genet, Eugène Ionesco, Samuel Beckett, Harold Pinter, Friedrich Dürrenmatt, Dario Fo, Heiner Müller, and Caryl Churchill.\n\nWestern opera is a dramatic art form that arose during the Renaissance in an attempt to revive the classical Greek drama in which dialogue, dance, and song were combined. Being strongly intertwined with western classical music, the opera has undergone enormous changes in the past four centuries and it is an important form of theatre until this day. Noteworthy is the major influence of the German 19th-century composer Richard Wagner on the opera tradition. In his view, there was no proper balance between music and theatre in the operas of his time, because the music seemed to be more important than the dramatic aspects in these works. To restore the connection with the classical drama, he entirely renewed the operatic form to emphasize the equal importance of music and drama in works that he called \"music dramas\".\n\nChinese opera has seen a more conservative development over a somewhat longer period of time.\n\nPantomime (informally panto), is a type of musical comedy stage production, designed for family entertainment. It was developed in England and is still performed throughout the United Kingdom, generally during the Christmas and New Year season and, to a lesser extent, in other English-speaking countries. Modern pantomime includes songs, gags, slapstick comedy and dancing, employs gender-crossing actors, and combines topical humour with a story loosely based on a well-known fairy tale, fable or folk tale. It is a participatory form of theatre, in which the audience is expected to sing along with certain parts of the music and shout out phrases to the performers.\n\nThese stories follow in the tradition of fables and folk tales. Usually, there is a lesson learned, and with some help from the audience, the hero/heroine saves the day. This kind of play uses stock characters seen in masque and again commedia dell'arte, these characters include the villain (doctore), the clown/servant (Arlechino/Harlequin/buttons), the lovers etc. These plays usually have an emphasis on moral dilemmas, and good always triumphs over evil, this kind of play is also very entertaining making it a very effective way of reaching many people.\n\nPantomime has a long theatrical history in Western culture dating back to classical theatre. It developed partly from the 16th century commedia dell'arte tradition of Italy, as well as other European and British stage traditions, such as 17th-century masques and music hall. An important part of the pantomime, until the late 19th century, was the harlequinade. Outside Britain the word \"pantomime\" is usually used to mean miming, rather than the theatrical form discussed here.\n\nMime is a theatrical medium where the action of a story is told through the movement of the body, without the use of speech. Performance of mime occurred in Ancient Greece, and the word is taken from a single masked dancer called \"Pantomimus\", although their performances were not necessarily silent. In Medieval Europe, early forms of mime, such as mummer plays and later dumbshows, evolved. In the early nineteenth century Paris, Jean-Gaspard Deburau solidified the many attributes that we have come to know in modern times, including the silent figure in whiteface.\n\nJacques Copeau, strongly influenced by Commedia dell'arte and Japanese Noh theatre, used masks in the training of his actors. Étienne Decroux, a pupil of his, was highly influenced by this and started exploring and developing the possibilities of mime and refined corporeal mime into a highly sculptural form, taking it outside of the realms of naturalism. Jacques Lecoq contributed significantly to the development of mime and physical theatre with his training methods.\n\nWhile some ballet emphasises \"the lines and patterns of movement itself\" dramatic dance \"expresses or imitates emotion, character, and narrative action\". Such ballets are theatrical works that have characters and \"tell a story\", Dance movements in ballet \"are often closely related to everyday forms of physical expression, [so that] there is an expressive quality inherent in nearly all dancing\", and this is used to convey both action and emotions; mime is also used. Examples include Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's \"Swan Lake\", which tells the story of Odette, a princess turned into a swan by an evil sorcerer's curse, Sergei Prokofiev's ballet \"Romeo and Juliet\", based on Shakespeare's famous play, and Igor Stravinsky's \"Petrushka\", which tells tells the story of the loves and jealousies of three puppets.\n\nCreative drama includes dramatic activities and games used primarily in educational settings with children. Its roots in the United States began in the early 1900s. Winifred Ward is considered to be the founder of creative drama in education, establishing the first academic use of drama in Evanston, Illinois.\n\nThe earliest form of Indian drama was the Sanskrit drama. Between the 1st century AD and the 10th was a period of relative peace in the history of India during which hundreds of plays were written. With the Islamic conquests that began in the 10th and 11th centuries, theatre was discouraged or forbidden entirely. Later, in an attempt to re-assert indigenous values and ideas, village theatre was encouraged across the subcontinent, developing in a large number of regional languages from the 15th to the 19th centuries. Modern Indian theatre developed during the period of colonial rule under the British Empire, from the mid-19th century until the mid-20th.\n\nThe earliest-surviving fragments of Sanskrit drama date from the 1st century AD. The wealth of archeological evidence from earlier periods offers no indication of the existence of a tradition of theatre. The ancient \"Vedas\" (hymns from between 1500 and 1000 BC that are among the earliest examples of literature in the world) contain no hint of it (although a small number are composed in a form of dialogue) and the rituals of the Vedic period do not appear to have developed into theatre. The \"Mahābhāṣya\" by Patañjali contains the earliest reference to what may have been the seeds of Sanskrit drama. This treatise on grammar from 140 BC provides a feasible date for the beginnings of theatre in India.\n\nThe major source of evidence for Sanskrit theatre is \"A Treatise on Theatre\" (\"Nātyaśāstra\"), a compendium whose date of composition is uncertain (estimates range from 200 BC to 200 AD) and whose authorship is attributed to Bharata Muni. The \"Treatise\" is the most complete work of dramaturgy in the ancient world. It addresses acting, dance, music, dramatic construction, architecture, costuming, make-up, props, the organisation of companies, the audience, competitions, and offers a mythological account of the origin of theatre.\n\nIts drama is regarded as the highest achievement of Sanskrit literature. It utilised stock characters, such as the hero (\"nayaka\"), heroine (\"nayika\"), or clown (\"vidusaka\"). Actors may have specialised in a particular type. It was patronized by the kings as well as village assemblies. Famous early playwrights include Bhasa, Kalidasa (famous for \"Vikrama and Urvashi\", \"Malavika and Agnimitra\", and \"The Recognition of Shakuntala\"), Śudraka (famous for \"The Little Clay Cart\"), Asvaghosa, Daṇḍin, and Emperor Harsha (famous for \"Nagananda\", \"Ratnavali,\" and \"Priyadarsika\"). \"Śakuntalā\" (in English translation) influenced Goethe's \"Faust\" (1808–1832).\n\nRabindranath Tagore was a pioneering modern playwright who wrote plays noted for their exploration and questioning of nationalism, identity, spiritualism and material greed. His plays are written in Bengali and include \"Chitra\" (\"Chitrangada\", 1892), \"The King of the Dark Chamber\" (\"Raja\", 1910), \"The Post Office\" (\"Dakghar\", 1913), and \"Red Oleander\" (\"Raktakarabi\", 1924).\nGirish Karnad is a noted playwright, who has written a number of plays that use history and mythology, to critique and problematize ideas and ideals that are of contemporary relevance. Karnad's numerous plays such as \"Tughlaq\", \"Hayavadana\", \"Taledanda\", and \"Naga-Mandala\" are significant contributions to Indian drama. Vijay Tendulkar and Mahesh Dattani are amongst the major Indian playwrights of the 20th century. Mohan Rakesh in Hindi and Danish Iqbal in Urdu are considered architects of new age Drama. Mohan Rakesh's Aadhe Adhoore and Danish Iqbal's \"Dara Shikoh\" are considered modern classics.\n\nUrdu Drama evolved from the prevailing dramatic traditions of North India shaping Rahas or Raas as practiced by exponents like Nawab Wajid Ali Shah (1822 – 1887) of Awadh. His dramatic experiments led to the famous Inder Sabha of Amanat and later this tradition took the shape of Parsi Theatre. Agha Hashr Kashmiri is the culmination of this tradition.\n\nUrdu theatre tradition has greatly influenced modern Indian theatre. Theatre has flourished in Urdu (which was called Hindi by early writers), along with Gujrati, Marathi, and Bengali. Urdu drama has had an important influence on Bombay Film industry and all the early works of Urdu theatre (performed by Parsi Companies) were made into films. Urdu dramatic tradition has existed for more than a 100 years.\n\nProf Hasan, Ghulam Jeelani, J.N,Kaushal, Shameem Hanfi, Jameel Shaidayi, etc. belong to the old generation, contemporary writers like Danish Iqbal, Sayeed Alam, Shahid Anwar, Iqbal Niyazi, and Anwar are a few postmodern playwrights actively contributing in the field of Urdu Drama.\n\nSayeed Alam is known for his wit and humour and more particularly for plays like 'Ghalib in New Delhi', 'Big B' and many other works, which are regularly staged for large audiences. \"Maulana Azad\" is his most important play both for its content and style.\n\nDanish Iqbal's play \"Dara Shikoh\" directed by M. S. Sathyu is a modern classic that uses newer theatre techniques and a contemporary perspective. His other plays are \"Sahir\". on the famous lyricist and revolutionary poet. \"Kuchh Ishq kiya Kuchh Kaam\" is another play written by Danish which is basically a Celebration of Faiz's poetry, featuring events from the early part of his life, particularly the events and incidents of pre-partition days which shaped his life and ideals. \"Chand Roz Aur Meri Jaan\" – another play inspired from Faiz's letters written from various jails during the Rawalpindi Conspiracy days. He has written 14 other plays including \"Dilli Jo Ek Shehr Thaa\" and \"Main Gaya Waqt Nahin hoon\". Shahid's \"Three B\" is also a significant play. He has been associated with many groups like 'Natwa' and others. Zaheer Anwar has kept the flag of Urdu theatre flying in Kolkata. Unlike the writers of previous generation Sayeed, Shahid, Danish Iqbal and Zaheer do not write bookish plays but their work is a product of performing tradition. Iqbal Niyazi of Mumbai has written several plays in Urdu, his play \"AUR KITNE JALYANWALA BAUGH?\" won a National award other awards. Hence this is the only generation after Amanat and Agha Hashr who actually write for stage and not for libraries.\n\nChinese theatre has a long and complex history. Today it is often called Chinese opera although this normally refers specifically to the popular form known as Beijing opera and Kunqu; there have been many other forms of theatre in China, such as zaju.\n\nJapanese Nō drama is a serious dramatic form that combines drama, music, and dance into a complete aesthetic performance experience. It developed in the 14th and 15th centuries and has its own musical instruments and performance techniques, which were often handed down from father to son. The performers were generally male (for both male and female roles), although female amateurs also perform Nō dramas. Nō drama was supported by the government, and particularly the military, with many military commanders having their own troupes and sometimes performing themselves. It is still performed in Japan today.\n\nKyōgen is the comic counterpart to Nō drama. It concentrates more on dialogue and less on music, although Nō instrumentalists sometimes appear also in Kyōgen. Kabuki drama, developed from the 17th century, is another comic form, which includes dance.\n\n"}

{"id": "16761344", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16761344", "title": "External wall insulation", "text": "External wall insulation\n\nAn external wall insulation system (or EWIS) is a thermally insulated, protective, decorative exterior cladding procedure involving the use of expanded polystyrene, mineral wool, polyurethane foam or phenolic foam, topped off with a reinforced cement based, mineral or synthetic finish and plaster.\n\nThe thickness of thermal insulation is dependent on whatever type is required in order to create a partition with a heat transmission factor of U=0.25-0.3 W/m2K. When calculating the actual insulation requirements, consideration must be given to current Building Regulation standards. Consideration must also be given to exposure and durability, and whether the structure might be subjected to vandalism etc. In many older properties, special attention is required for concrete beams or lintels which act as thermal bridges providing poor insulation.\n\nExternal wall insulation systems generally comprise firstly an insulation layer (an element which helps to achieve the requisite thermal performance); and secondly,a protected weatherproof finish (usually a render, although brick slips, tiles, and decorative boards can also be used). Insulating render can also be an advantage in certain locations. Choice of types and sizes will depend on the substrate and design exposure requirements.\n\nDry finishes are usually fixed to the substrate by means of timber battens independently fixed to the substrate.\n\nAny system selected and installed, should be certified by a notified body.\n\nA selection of traditional finishes is currently utilised within the external wall insulation industry. Dry-dash render is a traditional render application commonly used. By this method, dry dashing aggregate is thrown onto the wet render to create a natural aggregate finish. Available in a wide variety of colours, sizes and textures, the practice is relatively cheap. Manufactured aggregates such as ceramics and glass can be used for more specialised projects, but the costs will be greater than for projects using natural aggregates.\n\nScratch plaster render is a coloured cementitious render scratched while the surface is still workable, but after the initial setting has taken place. The surface of the render is removed by the action of the scratching tool, and approximately of render are removed exposing the open matrix of the aggregate mix. The true colour of the render is exposed with a light even texture.\n\nRough-cast render consists of a top-coat render and aggregate mix thrown onto a backing coat in a slurry form, the aggregate being totally encapsulated within the cementitious slurry. The aggregate may be any hard stone of an equal graded size to suit the particular application and creates a “lumpy texture” finish. This method is traditionally widely used in Scotland.\n\nAn innovation is the inclusion of silicone water-proofers in pre-blended and pre-packed proprietary renders. This development increases the specification and capabilities of polymer renders, particularly for exposed or coastal areas. It is applied in the conventional manner and is now readily available in all the usual colours.\n\nTyrolean finishes are sprayed cementitious mixes, pre-coloured and applied by a hand-held machine. This finish is widely used throughout the UK as an economical, easily applied colourful finish for all forms of building type. It has medium-term durability under average conditions.\n\nSmooth/painted finishes consist of masonry paint, and are applied to a good rendered surface to give a smooth coloured effect, free of the imperfections that the more natural aggregate finishes can sometimes deliver. A very wide selection of light colours are available.\n\nTextured coatings are applied by roller or trowel to an approximate thickness of , and are usually acrylic or silicone-based for waterproofing and long term durability. They produce an even, flat-textured, finish.\n\nAcrylic variants are easily applied, and are considered “high performance” finishes. Some cheaper variants might result in the loss opacity of surface brightness over a relatively short life span. High quality acrylics can provide a longer term durability, colour stability, and crack resistance compared to polymer cement finishes. Acrylic variants are available in a very wide range of colours.\n\nSilicone variants are more resistant to marine environments than acrylics, as they have superior water resistance, but they can be more costly, and come in a smaller range of colours.\n\nBrick slips are a thin facing applied over an insulant to provide a traditional “brick” wall finish. Slips can either be manufactured by extrusion or cut from real bricks. Specialist waterproof coloured pointing mortars are used to complete the effect. Commercially available brick slip systems have been developed to include support for the brick slip finish, certified by BBA/BRE. The brick slips usually have a size of about 210-240 x 50-71 x 20 mm (length x height x width).\n\nSimulated brick renders can also be replicated in coloured polymer to a high standard. Two coloured layers of polymer-modified external cementitious render are applied in layers onto a coloured backing. The “brick” pattern is cut into the top layer, exposing an under-layer of differing colour representing the cement joints.\n\nSimulated stone renders are made from coloured polymer. Two coloured layers of polymer-modified external cementitious render are applied in layers onto a specified backing. The “stone” pattern is cut into the top layer exposing an under-layer of differing colour to represent the cement joints.\n\nTerracotta tiles are usually of clay burnt material imported from Europe. These proprietary systems are secured by a system of extruded aluminium rail systems fixed securely to the substrate with insulation material inserted within the void. Special pressed metal profiles and cills are added to make them waterproof.\n\nTimber boards, aluminium or PVC “sidings” can be installed over insulation to provide additional alternatives to the traditional render and applied finishes. The boards are usually of shiplap profile, and either cedar or treated softwood. Aluminium or PVC systems are also available as alternatives.\n\nTraditional tile hanging finishes can be applied onto conventional timber support structures and insulated with the required type and thickness of insulation. Suitable consideration has to be given to ventilation passages to avoid interstitial condensation.\n\nWith the UK aiming to reduce its carbon emissions by 80% by the year 2050, the British government has offered up to £6,000 cashback to homeowners who install EWI at their solid wall property. South Wales, where the housing stock is in particular need of being updated to become energy efficient, has seen a surge in applications for this scheme.\n\nExternal wall insulation is a great and confirmed way to reduce energy usage needed to heat up the building. Installing it is a part of and eco home or carbon neutral home idea.\n\nParticular product requirements need to be met such as the external wall insulation product reaching a particular u-value in order to make the building sufficiently thermally insulated and therefore be used for a green deal project.\n\nThe application of External Wall Insulation can help to deal with rain penetration problems through solid walls by blocking wind-driven rain. However, it can also make the problem worse if poor detailing (e.g. around eaves) allows water to pass behind the external wall insulation where it can become trapped. A high standard of design and installation should therefore be insisted upon. The dangers of not adequately designing and specifying these systems is dealt with in a research paper written by Joe Malone and published in the CIOB's Construction, Research and Innovation Journal (Volume 4, Issue 4, Dec 2013 The Risky Business of Covering Up)\n\nExternal Wall Insulation should only be applied to walls that do not suffer from pre-existing dampness problems. The Energy Saving Trust give the following advice.\n\n\"The main damp issue to be avoided with external wall insulation is rising damp. If you already have a problem with this, then it will have to be fixed before the insulation is fitted, otherwise you run the risk of trapping the damp inside the wall structure and so making the problem worse.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31847810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31847810", "title": "Feminist ethics", "text": "Feminist ethics\n\nFeminist ethics is an approach to ethics that builds on the belief that traditionally ethical theorizing has under-valued and/or under-appreciated women's moral experience, which is largely male dominated, and it therefore chooses to re imagine ethics through a holistic feminist approach to transform it.\n\nFeminist philosophers critique traditional ethics as pre-eminently focusing on men's perspective with little regard for women's viewpoints. Caring and the moral issues of private life and family responsibilities were traditionally regarded as trivial matters. Generally, women are portrayed as ethically immature and shallow in comparison to men. Traditional ethics prizes masculine cultural traits like \"independence, autonomy, intellect, will, wariness, hierarchy, domination, culture, transcendence, product, asceticism, war, and death,\" and gives less weight to culturally feminine traits like \"interdependence, community, connection, sharing, emotion, body, trust, absence of hierarchy, nature, immanence, process, joy, peace, and life.\" Should women embody or use any traditionally masculine cultural traits they are seen as other or as an attempt to be more like men. Traditional ethics has a \"male\" orientated convention in which moral reasoning is viewed through a framework of rules, rights, universality, and impartiality and becomes the standard of a society. The \"female\" approaches to moral reasoning emphasizes relationships, responsibilities, particularity, and partiality.\n\nFeminist ethics developed from Mary Wollstonecraft's 'Vindication of the Rights of Women' published in 1792. With the new ideas from the Enlightenment, individual feminists being able to travel more than ever before, generating more opportunities for the exchange of ideas and advancement of women's rights. With new social movements like Romanticism there developed unprecedented optimistic outlook on human capacity and destiny. This optimism was reflected in John Stuart Mill's essay The Subjection of Women (1869). Feminist approaches to ethics, were further developed around this period by other notable people like Catherine Beecher, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton with an emphasis on the gendered nature of morality, specifically related to 'women's morality'.\n\nThe American writer and sociologist Charlotte Perkins Gilman imagined a fictional \"Herland\". In this male-free society, women produce their daughters through parthenogenesis and live a superior morality. This women-centered society valued both industriousness and motherhood while discouraged individualistic competitive approaches to life. Gilman thought that in such a scenario women could relate cooperatively as there would be no requirement to dominate each other. Herland cultivates and combines the best \"feminine\" virtues and the best \"masculine\" virtues together as co-extensive with human virtue. If a society wants to be virtuous, according to Gilman, it should exemplify the fictional utopia of Herland. However so long as women are dependent on men for economic support, women will continue to be known for their servility and men for their arrogance. Women need to be men's economic equals before they can develop truly human moral virtue, this is a perfect blend of pride and humility that we call self-respect.\n\nCarol Gilligan and Nel Noddings are exponents of a feminist care ethics which criticize traditional ethics as deficient to the degree they lack, disregard, trivialize or attack women's cultural values and virtues. In the 20th-century feminist ethicists developed a variety of care focused feminist approaches to ethics in comparison to non-feminist care-focused approaches to ethics, feminist ones tend to appreciate the impact of gender issues more fully. Feminist care-focused ethicists note the tendencies of patriarchal societies not to appreciate the value and benefits of women's ways of loving, thinking, working and writing and tend to view females as subordinate. This is why some social studies make a conscious effort to adopt feminist ethics, rather than just the traditional ethics of studies. An example of this was Roffee and Waling's 2016 study into microaggressions against the LGBTIQ community. Even though it was focused on the LGBTIQ community the feminist ethics were better suited, as they are more considerate to the vulnerabilities and needs of the participants. Medical fields also fail to recognize that ethics plays an often negative part in the LGBTIQ community in how they receive treatment and what treatments are given as options to them. As well a how women are also treated within medical fields.\n\nFeminist justice ethics is a feminist view on morality which seeks to engage with, and ultimately transform, traditional universal approaches to ethics. Like most types of feminist ethics, feminist justice ethics looks at how gender is left out of mainstream ethical considerations. Mainstream ethics are argued to be male-oriented. However, feminist justice ethics does differ considerably from other feminist ethics. A universal set of ethics is a significant part of feminist justice ethics but depending on the geographical location, such as the difference between the Global North and Global South, may differ in how justice is applied and may change what is considered justice. Feminist justice ethics is clear in dividing \"thick\" morality from \"thin\" morality. Other ethical approaches that define themselves by differentiating groups from one another through culture or other phenomena are regarded as \"thick\" accounts of morality. Feminist justice ethics claims that \"thick\" accounts of morality, as opposed to \"thin\" accounts of morality, are intrinsically prone to eroding valid feminist critique.\n\nFeminist ethicists believe there is an obligation for women's differing points of view to be heard and then to fashion an inclusive consensus view from them. To attempt to achieve this and to push towards gender equality with men together is the goal of feminist ethics. The fixing of these issues are important in modern times because of the shifting view points as well as what has considered to be 'ethical' in terms of treatment and how women, in particular, women's bodies should be treated.\n\n\"The goal of feminist ethics is the transformation of societies and situations where women are harmed through violence, subordination and exclusion. When such injustices are evident now and in the future, radical feminist activists will continue their work of protest and action following careful appraisal and reflection\" With violence, it once again circles back to masculine behavior and traditional ethics that such behavior and treatment was encourages. In today's society, the twentieth century, it is becoming less socially acceptable to commit violence against women.\n\nFeminist theories and that of ethics broaden the scope of the predominantly masculine sphere of International Relations. This is especially important for issues of the private realm to take stage into the public which includes issues such as children's rights, gender violence and discrimination, gender relations in war torn societies, and other similar issues which remain difficult to appear relevant in the mainstream discussions of ethics in international relations. The feminist dialogues of ethics are almost inescapably present to the private realm and are known to only shadow dominant 'male' paradigms of ethics in the public realm. This is especially a reality in discussion of ethics in International Relations where it is predominantly built on a language of violence, technologies or economics and what are known to be the masculine topics of discussion.\n\nSee Kimberly Hutchings discussion in \"Ethics\" for further detail on the foundations of the theory in International Relations \n\nAlison Watson \n\nWatson discusses the issue of children born of wartime rape and uses feminist theory of ethics in addressing these marginalized issues. The invisibility is emphasized in the traditional construction within much of the existing international discourse of motherhood as a 'private sphere activity' where important focused issues such as children of wartime rape can be lost in translation of international dialogue and minimally touched upon. Feminist theory of ethics is provided in terms of broadening theoretical dialogues of international relations and addressing issues that remain marginalized.\n\nPuechguirbal \n\nThere is evidence that failure to broaden the current scope of ethics in peacekeeping operations and rebuilding strategies, surrounding arms and violence, results in failing to meet the needs of both men and women. Puechguirbal argues that conflict is a 'gendered experience' and discusses the importance of peacekeeping operations keeping in check the differential impacts of war on women, men, boys and girls in post conflict society so as to not further marginalize the most vulnerable groups of the population Currently, peacekeeping operations are heavily masculine in the sense that security revolves around the cessation of hostilities and disarmament. Peacebuilding operations must shift the focus from solely disarming and cessation of hostilities against gang members to social constructions of violence against women, men, and children that is embedded in societies broken apart by conflict. Gender issues have not been part of mandates of peacekeeping missions and urges women to take a more active role in political processes in post-conflict reconstruction. Applying Feminist ethics in peacekeeping and re-building strategies can reach a wider range of issues as well as deemed not of dire importance in dialogues of International Relations. Current strategies are not reaching target goals of generating peace and cessation of gender violence and sexual abuses that continue to reach high levels in incidences. This remains a residue of post-conflict societies that must be addressed. Implementing feminist ethics generates greater peacekeeping and peacebuilding strategies for gendered strategies to meet the needs of both genders so as to be implemented into not only the institutions but society.\n\nWhen applying feminist ethics and care, it is important to consider in what way does that apply to those who are transgender, either Female to Male or Male to Female. As there is a historical with ethics being deeply rooted in religious ethics. For those who are transgender and wish to be identified as their preferred gender have to apply either masculine or feminine ethics in both appearance and thinking to pass. One notable mention is when “Halberstam claims that surgical intervention in the case of “sex-change” serves to “fictionalize” gender (i.e., render or expose as artificial) … a masculine performing butch lesbian, for example…”\n\n"}

However, in July 2010 the Congress of New Caledonia voted in favour of a wish to fly the Kanak flag alongside the French tricolor.\n\nIn 2008 the government of New Caledonia debated the introduction of an official regional flag and anthem, as required by the Accord de Nouméa. A flag in fairly widespread unofficial use was the flag of the Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front (FLNKS), a political party favoring independence for New Caledonia, but the French tricolor would remain the only flag used for the next two years.\n\nIn July 2010 the Congress of New Caledonia voted in favour of a wish to fly the Kanak flag alongside the French tricolor in the territory. On 17 July 2010, French Prime minister François Fillon took part in a ceremony in Nouméa where the FLNKS flag was hoisted alongside the French tricolor.\n\nHowever, the debate on finding a permanent official regional flag continued.\n\nThe adoption of the Kanak flag proved controversial. Some New Caledonians argued for a completely new flag for New Caledonia, which would incorporate designs from both the French tricolor and the Kanak flags. Such new flag would aim to promote a \"common destiny\" for ethnic Kanaks and ethnic French residents in New Caledonia.\n\nThe FLNKS flag, first adopted by the party in 1980, is composed of three horizontal stripes of blue (Pantone 286c), red (Pantone 032c) and green (Pantone 347c) charged with a yellow (Pantone 102c) disc of a diameter two-thirds the height of the flag centered at a position of one-third the width of the flag, measured from the hoist side. The disc is fibrated black and defaced with a vertical symbol, also black.\n\nThe blue symbolizes both the sky and more importantly the ocean surrounding New Caledonia. The red symbolizes the blood shed by the Kanaks in their struggle for independence, socialism, and unity. The green symbolizes the land itself and by extension the ancestors buried within it. The yellow disc is a representation of the sun and the symbol upon it consists of a \"flèche faitière\", a kind of arrow that adorns the roofs of Kanak houses thrust through \"tutut\" shells.\n\nNew Caledonia is divided into three provinces, each with its own flag.\n\n"}

He was an ardent admirer and follower of the Discalced Carmelite charism – but was not of their order – and was a central figure in the spiritual formation of Karol Józef Wojtyła who became Pope John Paul II. He was both the leader and student mentor of his friend's college parish of Saint Stanisław Kostka in the 1940s as well as a small group he ran on the behalf of the Salesians of Don Bosco during the wartime period.\n\nHis old friend launched the beatification process on 28 April 1997 and titled him as a Servant of God while the confirmation of his heroic virtue at the beginning of 2017 allowed for Pope Francis to title him as Venerable.\n\nJan Leopold Tyranowski was born on 9 February 1901 in Kraków to Jan Tyranowski and Apolonia Hrobak.\n\nHis father had plans for him and directing him to the accounting profession which he studied for. He obtained his high school diploma to enter accounting but this was something cut short in 1930 when he suffered from a chronic and debilitating stomach ailment that forced him to quit. He began to work in his father's tailor shop and inherited it after his death and so made this the focus of his life alongside his mother who aided him. When he assumed tailoring his stress reduced and he seemed to become much happier and active in his parish. He liked to be a loner and kept to himself and never married nor had children; he liked taking photos as well as gardening and had an avid interest in science and foreign languages. In 1935 he attended Mass and listened to a sermon a Salesian priest gave that would forever change his life and broaden his spiritual horizons. The priest said in the sermon that \"it is not difficult to become a saint\" and this had a profound impact on his own thinking on what it meant to be a saint and aspire for personal holiness. He became an ardent admirer and devotee to Saint John of the Cross and Saint Teresa of Ávila after reading their spiritual writings and he soon became enthralled with the Carmelite charism despite never joining them as a religious or secular member.\n\nAt the end of May 1941 one of the last Salesian priests asked him to assume control of a religious group of men and he accepted this and organized meetings of fifteen teenagers or young adults and called them \"Living Rosary\" groups. He continued the meetings in his apartment during the war and aided the Salesians whenever possible during the war due to an extensive number of them being apprehended as prisoners. The Gestapo even once discovered one such meeting but dismissed it as the gatherings of a religious fanatic. It was at these meetings that he first met Karol Józef Wojtyła – the future Pope John Paul II – in February or March 1940 during a retreat at the local parish.\n\nSometime in 1946 he fell ill with pulmonary tuberculosis and suffered great pain over the next several months due to the intensity of the disease that later claimed his life in 1947. He managed to attend Wojtyła's ordination as a priest on 1 November 1946 just a few months before his death. He was first buried at the Rakowicki Cemetery but was exhumed on 26 March 1998 and was buried in the church of Saint Stanisław Kostka that the Salesians of Don Bosco manage in Kraków's district of Dębniki.\n\nThe future pope found the man intense to an almost unbearable degree but soon came to see something of profound import in him. Later in life Wojtyła stated: \"What he tried to teach us was new. He wanted to pull new listeners to this new life\". The future pope went on to state that Tyranowski made the effort to teach them new things that were unknown to them or what people were unwilling to learn and accept. The future pope was also introduced to the writings of the Carmelite Saint John of the Cross after Tyranowski exposed him to it; John of the Cross would come to be one of the great inspirations in the life of Wojtyla.\n\nHe was one of those unknown saints, hidden amid the others like a marvelous light at the bottom of life, at a depth where night usually reigns. He disclosed to me the riches of his inner life, of his mystical life. In his words, in his spirituality and in the example of a life given to God alone, he represented a new world that I did not yet know. I saw the beauty of a soul opened up by grace.\n\nMieczyslaw Malinski – a friend of Wojtyła's and a member of Tyranowski's group who later became a priest was also skeptical at first about this religious eccentric but came to accept Tyranowski's teachings as something deep and insightful. Malinski stated later that \"Jan's influence with [Karol] was gigantic. I can safely say that if it wasn't for him neither Wojtyla nor I would have become priests\".\n\nWojtyla wrote in May 1949:\nThis man was not a fiction or a symbol, but a real living person. His name was Tyranowski. Jan Tyranowski. He lived in Krakow, in Debniki, at 15 Rozana Street. He was born in 1900 and died in March 1947 ... His family was of a typical suburban middle class ... It is worth noting that Jan’s demeanor, for example, the way he wore his watch, his expressions, all of the many details that reflect the social environment, were totally consistent with that environment. The entire difference was hidden within, and it was from within that all his external habits obtained their particular character. Jan guided his inner life according to the book \"Mistyka\" by Father Semenenko. Later, however, Saint John of the Cross and Saint Thérèse of the Child Jesus became his chief spiritual masters. They were not only his masters, they led him to discover himself, they explained and justified his own life.\n\nThe Salesians of Don Bosco – whom he aided during World War II – took charge of the cause for beatification. His old friend John Paul II started the beatification cause on 28 April 1997 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the \"nihil obstat\" and titled him as a Servant of God. The diocesan process spanned from 30 September 1997 until 15 March 2000 when it closed and it later received C.C.S. validation on 16 November 2001 before the C.C.S. received the Positio dossier from the postulation in 2011.\n\nThe theologians met and approved the dossier's contents on 15 September 2015 as did the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. on 17 January 2017. The confirmation of his life of heroic virtue allowed for Pope Francis to title him as Venerable on 20 January 2017.\n\nThe current postulator for the cause is the Salesian priest Pierluigi Cameroni while the previous postulator was the Salesian bishop Enrico dal Covolo.\n\n\n"}

A lining reduces the wearing strain on clothing, extending the useful life of the lined garment. A smooth lining allows a coat or jacket to slip on over other clothing easily, and linings add warmth to cold-weather wear.\n\nLinings are typically made of solid colors to coordinate with the garment fabric, but patterned and contrasting-colored linings are also used. Designer Madeleine Vionnet introduced the ensemble in which the coat was lined in the fabric used for the dress worn with it, and this notion remains a characteristic of the Chanel suit, which often features a lining and blouse of the same fabric.\n\nIn tailoring, home sewing, and ready-to-wear clothing construction, linings are usually completed as a unit before being fitted into the garment shell.

Although the mudik homecoming travel before Lebaran takes place in most Indonesian urban centers, the highlight is on the nation's largest urban agglomeration; Greater Jakarta, as millions of Jakartans exit the city by various means of transportation, overwhelming train stations and airports and also clogging highways, especially the Trans-Java toll road and Java's Northern Coast Road.\n\nThe motivation of this homecoming tradition is of course to visit one's family, especially parents. However, people might seek to come to their hometown during this period to attend a rare opportunity: a gathering of members of the extended family, the seldomly seen relatives that are normally scattered in other cities, other provinces or even overseas.\n\nMudik for Eid al-Fitr, or its similar traditions, exists in countries with Muslim majorities, such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Other similar annual homecoming traditions are also observable in various parts of the world, including Chinese New Year in China, Thai Songkran, Christmas in Europe, Divali in India and Thanksgiving in America, where family members are expected to come home during these specific holidays.\n\nThe term \"mudik\" in Indonesian means \"to sail or to travel to \"udik\" (upstream, inland) by the river\". The term \"mudik\" or \"udik\" is also found in local Indonesian languages, including Malay, Minang, Betawi, Sundanese and Javanese languages.\n\nThe tradition to visit one's hometown, home village or family ancestral home is not a new tradition in Indonesian history. Manuscripts dated from the Majapahit period describes that nobles and royals often travelled from the capital city in Trowulan to their ancestral home, in order to honor and appease ancestral spirits. In Balinese tradition, Hindu Balinese people came home to their hometowns or their home villages during Galungan and Kuningan sacred days, as they believed it marks the time when the ancestral spirits visit their descendants in the mortal world.\n\nIn most parts of Indonesia where Islam is the majority, the homecoming or \"mudik\" tradition is most often conducted in the month of Ramadhan, between a week to several days prior to Lebaran (Eid al-Fitr). Nevertheless, other ethnicities such as the Madurese are known to conduct their \"mudik\" tradition prior to Eid al-Adha instead. Indonesian Christians, on the other hand, might travel to their hometown prior to Christmas.\n\nThe term \"mudik\" to coin the specific homecoming activity, started to enter common Indonesians' vocabulary since the 1970s. It is suggested that in 1970s, during the start of Suharto's centralized New Order regime, the prominence of Jakarta as the center of the nation's politics, administrative and economic activities prompted massive urbanization, where the population of rural Javanese villages flocked and migrated to Jakarta and surrounding areas (Greater Jakarta) seeking jobs and economic opportunities. The majority of the migrants came from rural Javanese areas; nevertheless, Jakarta also attracted migrants from all over Indonesia. These newcomer migrants, that still nurture their links to their hometowns in rural Java or other corners in Indonesia, were actively involved in the annual mudik travel.\n\nOutside of Java, Mudik homecoming is also significantly observable in Sumatra, especially in West Sumatra, Riau, Jambi, South Sumatra corridors, where numbers of migrant workers, especially Minang \"perantauan\" (migrant) return to their hometown to celebrate Idul Fitri.\n\nThe government of Indonesia provides additional transportation to handle the massive surge of travellers in several days prior to and after the Lebaran. In 2013 there were around 30 million people travelling to their hometowns during Lebaran. They spent a total sum of around 90 trillion rupiah (around US$9 billion) in rural areas. The numbers of Indonesians that take \"mudik\" or \"pulang kampung\" travel is quite tremendous. In 2017 it was estimated that the people that took annual \"mudik\" travel reached 33 million people. The numbers is approximately equal to the whole population of Malaysia (31 million, 2017 est.). This causes massive traffic jams and a sudden rise of demand and volume of intercity transportation.\n\nThe demand for train and airplane tickets usually spikes a month or two prior to Lebaran, prompting an unusually higher cost for tickets for highly sought days of departure. Some airlines might add extra flights or operate larger airplanes to deal with the surge in demand. Indonesian train operator Kereta Api Indonesia usually offers additional train trips or introduces longer trains with more cars in order to meet the demand. The private operators of intercity and interprovince buses usually charge higher ticket costs during this period.\n\nThe heaviest burdens faced during mudik are congestion and travel delays on public transport or the existing road network.\n\nThe impact is indeed tremendous as millions of buses, cars and motorcycles jam the roads and highways, causing kilometres of traffic jams each year. The massive congestion usually occurs along Trans-Java toll road and Java's Northern Coast Road. \nThe mudik travellers take various modes of transportation to reach their hometowns. Some of them might even ride a motorcycle. Although it might be done for short range of travel, the police and authority have discouraged this practice, citing the motorcycle's potential danger and unsuitablity for mid- to long-range mudik travel. Large numbers of mudik accidents involve motorcyclists. To reduce mudik travellers using motorcycles, the government tried to lure motorcyclists away from mudik travel by offering \"mudik gratis\", or free mudik program. The program offers motorcyclists a free service to send their motorcycles via railways, trucks or ships to their towns separately, while they travel with another mode of transportation instead. Despite initial success in reducing mudik motorcyclists in 2014 and 2015, the number of mudik motorcyclists spiked in 2016 to 5.6 million motorcycles.\n\nThe sudden exodus of large numbers of migrant workers — most of them are low-skilled labourers, domestic helpers, and those who work in service sectors — has created a void in Jakarta and other major cities' daily activities, as numbers of business, services, establishments, \"warung\" and restaurants are closed for Lebaran. The sudden loss of occupants after Mudik is also observable on relatively empty Jakarta streets during Lebaran, which normally suffers from clogged traffic. Additionally, the wealthier classes — who do not participate in mudik travel — often go to local hotels or overseas to accommodate the absence of their domestic servants, drivers, and even security guards.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "162883", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=162883", "title": "Māori culture", "text": "Māori culture\n\nMāori culture is the culture of the Māori of New Zealand (an Eastern Polynesian people) and forms a distinctive part of New Zealand culture.\n\nWithin the Māori community, and to a lesser extent throughout New Zealand as a whole, the word Māoritanga is often used as an approximate synonym for Māori culture, the Māori suffix \"-tanga\" being roughly equivalent to the qualitative noun ending \"-ness\" in English. There have been three distinct but overlapping cultural eras—before widespread European contact, the 1800s in which Māori began interacting with European visitors and settlers, and the modern era since the beginning of the 20th century. Culture in the modern era has been shaped by increasing urbanisation, closer contact with New Zealanders of European descent (or \"Pākehā\") and revival of traditional practices.\n\nTraditional arts make up a large section of New Zealand art and include whakairo (carving), raranga (weaving), kapa haka (group performance), whaikorero (oratory), and tā moko (tattoo). Practitioners often follow the techniques of their ancestors, but today Māoritanga also includes contemporary arts such as film, television, poetry and theatre.\n\nPre-European Māori stories and legends were handed down orally and through weavings and carvings. Some surviving \"Te Toi Whakairo\", or carving, is over 500-years-old. \"Tohunga Whakairo\" are the great carvers—the master craftsmen. The Māori believed that the gods created and communicated through the master craftsmen. Carving has been a \"tapu\" art, subject to the rules and laws of \"tapu\". Pieces of wood that fell aside as the carver worked were never thrown away, neither were they used for the cooking of food. Women were not permitted near \"Te Toi Whakairo\".\n\nThe Māori language is known natively as \"te reo Māori\", or shortened to \"te reo\" (literally, the language). At the beginning of the twentieth century, it looked like \"te reo\" as well as other aspects of Māori life would disappear. In the 1980s however, government-sponsored schools taught \"te reo\", educating those of European descent as well as Māori.\n\nMāori cultural history is inextricably tied into the culture of Polynesia as a whole. Aotearoa (New Zealand) is the southwestern corner of the Polynesian Triangle, a region of the Pacific Ocean with three island groups at its corners: the Hawaii islands, Rapa Nui (Easter Island), and New Zealand (Aotearoa in Māori). The many island cultures within the Polynesian Triangle share similar languages derived from a proto-Malayo-Polynesian language used in southeastern Asia 5,000 years ago. Polynesians also share cultural traditions such as religion, social organisation, myths, and material culture. Anthropologists believe that all Polynesians have descended from a south Pacific proto-culture created by an Austronesian (Malayo-Polynesian) people that had migrated from southeastern Asia.\n\nThe other main Polynesian cultures are Rapa Nui (now known as Easter Island), Hawaiʻi, Marquesas, Sāmoa, Tahiti, Tonga, and Cook Islands.\n\nOver the last five millennia, a sequence of complicated and remarkable transoceanic treks were performed in an unprecedented accomplishment of navigation and curiosity. The final segments of these feats were across extreme and unmatched distances: to Hawaii, Rapanui, and Aotearoa. \n\nPolynesian seafarers were ocean navigators and astronomers. Polynesians would travel long distances by sea. The strong female presence among early settlers in New Zealand suggests Polynesian migration voyages were not accidental but deliberate. The most current reliable evidence strongly indicates that initial settlement of New Zealand occurred around 1280 CE from the Society Islands. In 1769 the experienced Society Island navigator Tupaia joined Captain Cook in the Endeavour on his voyage south. Despite a gap of many hundreds of years Tupaia was able to understand the Maori language which was very similar to the language he spoke. His presence and ability to translate avoided much of the friction between other European explorers and Maori in New Zealand.\n\nEuropean sailors, including Cook, found Polynesian sailors lost at sea, suggesting that by mid 18th century Polynesians had lost the art of very long distance navigation.\n\nResearchers often label the time from about 1280 to about 1450 the \"Moa-hunter period\" - after the moa, the large flightless bird that formed a large part of the diet of the early settlers. Nine different moa species occurred commonly in the south-east and east of the South Island. In the far South it was too cold to grow the kūmara sweet potato . Large quantities of tī tubers were eaten that were slow-cooked in large \"umu\" or \"hāngi\" (earth ovens) to get rid of poison and to produce a slightly sweet pulp. Shellfish, fish, sharks and seals were also common foods. Native dogs (kurī) and rats were brought from the Pacific Islands. The introduction of rats undoubtedly had more impact on New Zealand wildlife than any other organism apart from humans. The dogs were used for hunting but also as food.\nThe Society Island colonists explored New Zealand to find suitable stone for tool-making. The main stone source areas included Mayor Island, Taupo and Kerikeri for obsidian (volcanic glass); prospectors soon found \"pounamu\" (greenstone or jade) and argillite (\"pakohe\") resources in the South Island in the Reefton and Nelson areas. Stone served in all aspects of Polynesian life: from chopping wood to cutting and slicing food, as anchors for \"waka\" and fishing nets, as hangi stones for retaining the heat in a slow-cooking earth oven, as drills using chert, and for stone clubs.\n\nArchaeological evidence in early proto-Māori settlements, especially at the Wairau Bar that was intensively studied by Roger Duff, shows some typical East Polynesian cultural practices, including burial methods and the use of hangi (earth ovens).\n\nTwo Polynesian artifacts link early settlers to Polynesia. One, a turret shell only found in the South Pacific islands, most notably in the Society Islands, has been reworked into a small chisel found at Wairau Bar and dated to about 1300. The other is a 6 cm long Polynesian pearl fishing lure found at Tairua in 1962. This lure has been reliably dated to the early- to mid-14th century. It was found at a typical small coastal moa-hunters' site which has been interpreted as an itinerant hunting camp (whakaruruhau). The discovery of Mayor Island obsidian on the Kermadec Islands, halfway between New Zealand and Polynesia, strongly suggests return journeys were made.\n\nThe new environment offered challenges to the settlers. Its cold climate meant that tropical staple crops needed careful cultivation to survive, and some failed to grow locally. Kūmara was an important crop that arrived with the Polynesian settlers. Much of the activity to produce kūmara became ritualised – it was even associated with Rongomātāne (Rongo), a high-ranking atua (god). Kūmara featured in some whakataukī (proverbs): \"Kaore te kūmara e kōrero mo tōna māngaro\" (the kūmara does not speak of its own sweetness) encouraged people to be modest.\n\nHowever, there were also new opportunities. Māori learned to use local resources like pounamu, native timber, \"harakeke\" and the abundant birdlife, producing practical tools or food, as well as beautiful ornaments and items of clothing.\n\nSeasonal activities included gardening, fishing and the hunting of birds. Main tasks were segregated for men and women, but there were also a lot of group activities involving food gathering and food cultivation.\n\nMāori artifacts began to change around the 15th century from East Polynesian style to one more recognisably \"classical\" Māori, a style which persisted well into the contact period in the 18th and 19th centuries. At the same time, Māori groups became less nomadic, more settled in defined territories, and more dependent on gardening as a food source. Reliance on stored food such as kūmara tubers meant that stores needed to be protected from marauding neighbours. The widespread construction of large fortifications called pā on prominent hills and spurs dates from this time, as evidence of the development of a more martial, tribal culture.\n\nA key concept regulating social and economic exchange was utu, which is sometimes translated as revenge but better translated as \"reciprocity\" or \"balanced exchange\". Economically, this took the form of gift exchange. This was governed by three basic principles. Firstly giving had to have the appearance of being free and spontaneous, without stipulation of a return present. Secondly a strict system of obligation was in force whereby the receiver was bound to not only reciprocate but to increase the value of the reciprocated gift. Thirdly the system demanded that further social obligation had now been established to continue the exchanges. Failure to respond meant loss of mana or influence. Where parties had traveled a long way to give a present it was expected that the return gift be immediate but often due to seasonal food supplies it was accepted that a return gift would be given at some later date when supplies allowed.\n\nWhile a gift conveyed an obligation to return the favour, so did an insult. The response might be a martial one. Historian Angela Ballara describes warfare as a \"learned, culturally determined [response] to offences against the rules of Māori society.\"\n\nHistorian Judith Binney says that maintaining and increasing the mana of whanau and hapu and loyalty within the group are unquestionably at the heart of Māori cultural concepts. She says that Māori cultural history is confusing to the uninformed as it consists of narrative-myths that stretch far back in time. Also confusing is that chronological time is irrelevant or distorted to the Māori cultural story, so a person living in the present may narrate a story about their family or hapu that happened centuries ago; nonetheless, the narrator appears as a contemporary figure in the myth. A key element of cultural leadership is to link the narrator to a well known historical figure with mana (prestige/authority power). This is why being able to recite the family history is so important. In Māori culture names of people and places are fluid. Individuals may change their name several times or have several different names that they use depending on the cultural situation. In the past, hapu changed names if they moved to another area where an alternative name was more positive. One of the main reasons for name fluidity was access to resources. As a hapu moved seasonally to utilise different resources its name changed to reflect an ancestor who had historical cultural rights to that resource. Binney says that being connected to a powerful hapu with many well known ancestors was important for protection and survival.\nAs Māori communication was almost totally oral until well into the contact period, oral myth-narratives became more varied to match the needs of each hapu or whanau.\n\nTapu is a key concept within Maori culture, that sustains structure and social order. It can be seen as a legal or religious concept, that is centered on the idea of being \"forbidden\" and \"sacred.\" When a person, place, or thing is considered to be \"tapu,\" it is often distinguished as something in high value and importance, being set aside by the gods. \n\nMana is a cultural concept of the Māori, meaning a sacred power or authority. Tapu is similar to mana. Together, they keep the harmony of things. Mana is sacred power bestowed by the gods on the ancestral lineage of chiefs, or tohunga. While the mana itself is a supernatural gift, the chief is free to waste or magnify it. \n\nThe word \"utu\" is often associated with the word 'revenge'. However, in a broader sense, \"utu\" is meant as the preservation of balance and harmony within a civilization. In the concept of \"utu\", a fault must always be corrected. However, the means by which this is accomplished may vary greatly by case. In the context of a gift exchange, \"utu\" creates and preserves social connections and commitments. \"Utu\" recovers balance in the event that social relations are interrupted. A version of \"utu\", \"muru\", is defined as the confiscation of a person's possessions as reparation for a misdeed against an individual, community, or society. \nClassic Māori viewed disease as a punishment for breaking tribal tapu but tohunga recognised that some families were prone to certain disease. The standard practice of tohunga was to isolate the victim in a small shelter. The most common serious disease was tuberculosis (\"kohi\"), which was present in the colonizing Polynesians. Classic Māori did not recognise the symptoms as being from one disease. Kohi was considered the work of demons and caused by Makutu (witchcraft). Toke toke was the name of the devil that caused tubercular bone disease. Tuberculosis of the neck glands was called hura or hone. This was very common. Tubercular ulcers were called poka poka. The early European explorer and painter, Earle, noted in 1827 that these diseases were common even in isolated inland districts such as Taupo. His Māori advisers said the diseases were very old. Leprosy was another common disease. Māori legends had the disease arriving with the canoe that bought the Ngati Whatua to New Zealand. The Māori name was Ngerengare or Tuwhenua or Tukawaiki. Lepers were carefully isolated and avoided as it was recognised the disease was contagious. Two places-a location on Maungatautari mountain, near Cambridge and a cave at Oremu in Taupo have been recognised as places where lepers were isolated. Treatment of leprosy was by mixing two plants -Kawakawa and Ngaio with either dog or human excreta. The treatment did not work if a dog was touched according to Māori lore. Earle recognised that tohunga used a range of plants to treat minor skin ailments. Much later European doctors advocated investigation of the medicinal properties of plants commonly used in Māori medicine.\n\nEating shellfish such as mussels and oysters was very common. During summer sea fish such as kahawai were caught using bone or mangemange hooks, 2 piece lures or large flax nets. In creeks and lakes, eels were caught in large numbers when migrating along known waterways using hinaki, a long cone shaped net. Birds such as ducks were targeted during the moulting season and young birds such as Petrels and Gannets were taken from nests and cooked in their own fat to preserve them. Such preserved birds were favourite gifts to fulfill social gift obligations. Māori closely observed the natural world to take advantage of seasonal opportunities. Native pigeons ate Miro berries which made them thirsty. Māori carved wooden bowls equipped with multiple neck snares and placed these in Miro trees to catch these large birds.\n\nEvidence from many recent Eastern Golden Bay excavations, especially at Tata Beach, shows that in middens local shellfish and fish bones were most prominent, followed by dog (kuri) bones and rat bones. Less common were bones from small birds and sea mammals. The Tata beach site and other nearby sites such as Takapou were in use during the late \"Moa hunter\" period-1450 up to 1660, well into the \"Classic Māori\" period. The coastal sites showed that Māori had created man made soils in the sand dunes ranging from small to very large(over 100M2). The natural soil A horizons had been modified by placing dark, humus rich soil near the surface. This practice was widespread in Māori communities where kūmara was grown, although in many cases free-draining sand, gravels and pumice were mixed with humus rich loam. Kūmara are slow growing in the temperate NZ climate and need free-draining sub soils. In the Eastern Golden Bay north facing slopes were favoured.\n\nThe standard building in a classic Māori settlement was a simple sleeping \"whare puni\" (house/hut) about 2 metres x 3 metres with a low roof, an earth floor, no window and a single low doorway. Heating was provided by a small open fire in winter. There was no chimney.\n\nMaterial used in construction varied between areas, but raupo reeds, flax and totara bark shingles for the roof were common. Similar small \"whare\", but with interior drains, were used to store kūmara on sloping racks.\n\nIn the classic period a higher proportion of \"whare\" were located inside \"pa\" than was the case after contact with Europeans. A chief's \"whare\" was similar but larger—often with full headroom in the centre, a small window and a partly enclosed front porch. In times of conflict the chief lived in a \"whare\" on the \"tihi\" or summit of a hill pa. In colder areas, such as in the North Island central plateau, it was common for \"whare\" to be partly sunk into the ground for better insulation.\n\nFood was not cooked in the sleeping \"whare\" but in the open or under a \"kauta\" (lean-to). Saplings with branches and foliage removed were used to store and dry items such as fishing nets or cloaks. Valuable items were stored in pole-mounted storage shelters called \"pataka\". Other constructions were large racks for drying split fish.\n\nDuring the construction of important buildings, slaves were sometimes used as a sacrifice. This practice was done in order to express the buildings' significance and to secure the gods' protection. For smaller buildings, small animals were sacrificed to distinguish it from other buildings and to exhibit its uniqueness. \n\nBecause of the very small number of Europeans who visited New Zealand in the 18th and early 19th century, the core values of Māori culture were little altered. Henry Williams estimated there were only 1100 Europeans in the North Island in 1839, with 200 being missionaries, and a total of about 500–600 Europeans in the Bay of Islands. The northern Māori population at the time has been estimated by Ian Poole at about 30,000 to 40,000.\n\nFor decades, missionaries had very little influence over Māori in the north. Missionaries were appalled at the violent, seemingly arbitrary nature of Māori behaviour. They had no influence on warfare, slavery, sexual abuse of women, killing of female children or revenge killings. Cannibalism continued as before, except that increasingly Māori learnt to be less boastful about this act. However, by 1840, the custom was all but abolished.\n\nIn the coastal South Island the Māori population was very small. Whalers set up shore stations along the southern and eastern coasts and formed Māori–European working communities. In the early 1800s it was common for chiefs to provide whalers with Māori wives, often their daughters. By the 1820s, European men had married about 200 Māori women in the coastal area between modern Christchurch and Invercargill, about half of all the marriageable aged women in the South Island - in fact Māori men were finding it hard to compete for wives.\n\nContact with Europeans enabled Māori to access the material culture of England, then the most advanced industrial nation in the world. By 1800, the desire for iron objects such as large ships' nails overcame apprehension about boarding an anchored ship and this drove Māori trading behaviour, lasting until 1840. Desirable steel objects and blankets were at first traded for fish. Māori were generally very curious about European culture after initial misunderstandings and apprehension, with Māori showing great ability to accept changes and integrating these into their normal way of life Marion Du Fresne gave northern Māori potatoes, wheat, onions, goats, pigs, chickens and other food to raise. Potatoes and pigs rapidly became a key part of Māori agriculture in the north, but the new food was almost exclusively reserved for trading purposes, with Māori still eating fish and fern roots, supplemented by kūmara. Later, as Māori grew large areas of potatoes (Hongi Hika had a 40-acre potato field), whalers would call into the Bay of Islands in particular to trade for fresh supplies.\n\nOne significant change was the immediacy of reciprocation in trade. In tradition Māori tikanga, when an item was given there was no expectation of immediate response as gifted items were mainly food, which was governed by seasonal supply. When dealing with Europeans, Māori learnt that immediate payment was expected. Gift giving was a different matter in Māori culture. Gifts were given to recognise mana (power or authority).\n\nBurial practices also changed to incorporate aspects of Christianity. Bodies were usually buried in the ground by the mid 1840s although sometimes coffins, decorated with Maori motifs were used, suspended in trees or on poles as drawn by J. Polack. These were highly tapu.\n\nGradually, the Māori learned to trade for money instead of goods. This was rare before 1834 but became increasingly common as more Māori worked as sailors on European ships, where they gained a good reputation as being strong capable workers.\n\nBy 1839 a large proportion of the Māori trade in goods was paid for in cash, with Māori showing a strong preference for coins rather than paper banknotes. Northern Māori learnt that they could more easily hide cash from their relatives avoiding the traditional obligatory sharing of goods with their \"hapu\". The period 1835 to 1840 completed the revolution in the north Māori economy with Māori abandoning many of their former trading habits and adopting those of the Europeans to the point where Māori became dependent on the flow of European goods to maintain their new way of life.\nThe effect of trading increased the influence of chiefs over their \"hapu\". Northern traders assumed that the chief was the organizational head of the \"hapu\" and all trade went through him including payments for goods purchased. O'Malley says this gave chiefs much more influence, especially after 1835, because trade was so regular. He says that in pre-contact times the power of chiefs was never very great, largely being restricted to directing warfare. Early European observers noted that at \"hapu\" and \"whanuau hui\"(meetings) every person, including women, had their say and the chief had no more influence than any other person on the final decision. Where a chief had great mana, especially powers of persuasion, chiefs had more influence because of their personality rather than any recognised authority.\nNot all iwi had regular contact with Europeans. The French explorer D'Urville visited Tasman Bay in 1827 and using knowledge he had picked up at the Bay of Islands was able to communicate with local Māori. He found that although they had some passing awareness of Europeans—they seemed to know about firearms—the extent of their understanding was far less than that of the Northern Māori.\n\nIn the Waikato regular contact did not start until five decades after contact in the north of New Zealand. It was not until Ngāti Toa was forced out of Kawhia in 1821 that the bulk of the Tainui people had contact with Europeans. In 1823 a man called Te Puaha visited the Bay of Islands bringing back with him a Captain Kent who arrived by ship at Kawhia.\n\nBy 1859 trade was the main area in which Māori interacted with Europeans. Trade was an area that Māori expected to control. From first contact they had sold or exchanged fresh foodstuffs initially for high value goods such as axes and later for money. Grey was keen to encourage Māori trade and commerce and established new laws to empower them in 1846. Māori brought numerous cases under this legislation and won. This was their first and most successful legal experience. Māori had begun to include European concepts into their own cultural behaviour.\n\nThe introduction of European foods changed many aspects of Māori agriculture. Under tradition, Māori agriculture land was abandoned after a few crops because of reduced production. This was the common pattern apart from a few very fertile alluvial river valleys. Fertiliser was not used although Māori had devised various techniques to enhance production such as the addition of pumice or similar materials to improve drainage on heavy soils. Māori allowed gardens to revert to shrubs and plantations were shifted to another area.\n\nThe warmer climate of the north and northern and central coastal regions allowed better growth of subtropical plants such as kūmara, yam and gourds. In Auckland, and on Mayor Island, volcanic land was cleared of rocks which were used for low shelter walls. In some areas piles of volcanic rock which kept warm at night, were used to train the vines of gourds.\n\nMany special techniques had been devised to grow and especially to store kūmara so it did not rot. Careful storage and use of tapu was essential to prevent unauthorised use. Seed kūmara in particular were highly tapu. The main problem for kūmara growers were native caterpillars. Early European explorers reported that Māori often ringed a garden with burning vegetation in an attempt to control caterpillars. The introduction of foreign weeds which thrived was a significant issue from the 1820s but offset by the widespread growth of the introduced potato.\n\nEuropean farms and the methods they used became a cultural and economic magnet for Māori in the North, in Auckland and later in the Te Awamutu area of the Waikato. Under the tuition of missionaries, Māori learnt to mass-produce food, especially potatoes, far in excess of their own needs for trading into the late 1850s. In 1858 European numbers equalled Māori numbers and increasingly European farmers were able to supply towns such as Auckland. At the same time the strong market demand for supplying food to the gold rush markets in Australia and California ended.\n\nMāori continued to use traditional fern roots—aruhe—as a normal part of their diet into the mid-19th century.\n\nMany Europeans entered into dealings with Māori to obtain land for their use. In some cases settlers thought they were buying land to obtain equivalent to freehold title under British law; Māori now claim that the various deeds signed by Māori were more limited and conditional, stopping short of outright alienation. They claim that the use of the word \"tuku\" in deeds, meaning to let or allow or give freely, was not the same as selling. In 1997 the Waitangi Tribunal found that before the Treaty, Māori customs with respect to the land applied, and no valid sales could have been concluded. Critics, such as Dr Vincent O'Malley and history professor Michael Ballard, argue that the Tribunal ignored a large volume of documentary evidence that ran counter to its findings while upholding oral traditions that were incapable of being corroborated.\n\nMāori, especially after 1830, were eager to have Europeans living on their land under their protection so they could benefit from European knowledge. Missionaries on the other hand were keen to buy land so they could grow their own food to make them less dependent on tribal \"protectors\", who sometimes used food supplies to coerce them. Missionaries sought the ownership of land to enjoy financial security. Settlers allowed Maori to stay on the land they had \"bought\" and often continued to give presents to tribal chiefs, often prompted by the chiefs themselves, in order to maintain friendly relationships. These compromises stopped with the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi.\n\nAnother reason for Māori to \"sell\" land to missionaries was to protect the title of the land from other tribal competitors. Māori who had converted to Christianity wanted to protect their land without resorting to warfare. Some degree of control passed to the missionaries who Māori trusted to allow them continued access and use.\n\nFrom 1840 generally older chiefs were reluctant to sell while younger chiefs were in favour. The situation was complicated as Māori often had overlapping rights on poorly defined land. The settlers and the government also had very limited access to trained surveyors and even freehold land boundaries were ill-defined. Surveying was a relatively new skill, invented in USA in the late 18th century, and involved much hard physical work especially in hill country. New farmers were able to purchase a small freehold farm from Māori on which they established their homestead and farm buildings. They then entered into leases with Māori owners for much larger areas of land. Short term leases gave Māori a powerful position as there was a large demand for grazing land.\n\nThe Native Lands Act was a policy enforced by the government in 1865, which allowed the Māori people to obtain individual titles for their land to sell. This act abolished the traditional shared landholdings and made it easier for European settlers to directly purchase land for themselves. \n\nThere is little direct information on Māori slaves before the Musket Wars but it seems as though slavery was most likely present as the use of the term mokai indicates. Also Ngati Mutanga argued before the Native Land Court in 1870 that their enslavement of Morori was traditional Māori tikanga.\n\nThe British had outlawed slavery by 1807 but missionaries in New Zealand were in no position to force Māori to follow suit. Missionaries such as Henry Williams wrote of the fate of slaves being brought to the Bay of Islands by returning war canoes. Whanau who had lost a close relative in battle were seen to carry out immediate and bloody \"utu.\" Generally only female slaves were kept as they were less threat and more useful as potato farmers and partners. Potatoes could be grown by slaves, as they were not subject to the tapu restrictions around kūmara growing.\n\nIn 1834 Ngapuhi, partly due to the influence of missionaries such as Henry Williams, freed slaves they had captured in earlier wars, and in the later 1830s some northern chiefs complained to missionaries they found it difficult to adjust to former slaves behaving in a confident, and at times cocky manner, to their former owners.\n\nThe only place in New Zealand where slavery was common after 1835 was in the Chatham Islands where North Taranaki tribes Ngati Tama and Ngati Mutanga invaded and launched a massacre of about 10% of the local Moriori, and enslaved the remainder who were forbidden to marry or continue any aspects of their own unique culture. Slavery continued on the island until about 1863.\n\nCMS missionaries insisted Maori abandon cannibalism and child infanticide before they could be baptised. They tried to discourage polygamy. Some early missionaries had sympathy for abandoned wives but Henry Williams was adamant that polygamy disqualified Maori from baptism. CMS missionaries also outlawed the use of further \"moko,\" taking part in lewd dances and practising customary funeral rites. Catholic missionaries who arrived 20 years after the Church of England CMS missionaries were less concerned with stopping these customary practices before Christian conversion. They reasoned that they could influence Maori more effectively after baptism and were subsequently successful in attracting many converts in the western Hokianga district, away from the dominant CMS influence.\n\nMissionaries did not arrive in the Waikato until about 1834-5. CMS Mission Stations were established at Manakau, Maraetai, Waikato Heads, Kaitotehe opposite Tuapiri, Te Awamutu, Kopua and Kawhia. Missionaries helped explain the Treaty of Waitangi to Tainui in 1840.\n\nAccording to oral information Maori were familiar with the concept of schooling in tradition times as taught by tohunga (witch doctor/shaman). Bishop Selwyn took adult Maori to Sydney where they experienced limited schooling to learn English. When missionaries back in arrived in the Bay of Islands they realised that if they were going to introduce Christianity and change what they considered to be barbaric practices like cannibalism, slavery, lewd dancing and having multiple wives, they would need to establish schools. Both the missionaries and their wives constructed schools and provided slates and bibles as reading material. The first school was established by T. Kendal in 1816. Recently original slates and written material from that period in the Bay of Islands has been located, photographed and published. Some adults attended school but most pupils were the sons or daughter of chiefs or other persons of status.\nBy 1853 Mr and Mrs Ashwell had been running a mission school at Taupiri in the Waikato for 50 Maori girls for 3 years. The girls learnt arithmetic and reading. In the early 1860s Governor Grey had provided money to support a trade school near Te Awamutu in the Waikato. The aim was to produce Maori workers who were literate but could also work with, and repair, agricultural machinery as used on farms and in the new flour mills. In 1863 the renegade Rewi Maniapoto attacked and burnt down the school, stealing the printing press. He aimed to kill leading Europeans in the area but they had been warned by friendly Maori and left before the attack. Because of the negative influence of Maniapoto and other anti government factions, the school had previously had poor attendance, with as few as 10 boys attending regularly. All teaching by missionaries was in Maori and this continued in the native schools until 1900 when at the insistence of the Young Maori Party Maori MPs, schools started teaching in English. Influential Maori MPs Ngata and Pōmare insisted that Maori be taught modern ways and sponsored the Suppression of Tohungaism Act in parliament. Pōmare in particular worked hard to banish ancient Maori concepts and practices that caused harm in the Maori community.\n\nMaori were quick to learn the power of the printed word. The first Maori newspaper appeared in 1842. A number of different newspapers such as Te Pipiwharauroa and Te Korimako were written in Maori by Maori to convey information to a widespread Maori audience, often of a political or ideological nature. Although print runs were often small it was common for a newspaper to be passed around a whole hapu. Although the government printed newspapers in Maori such as Te Karere Maori, the Kingitanga movement was anxious to convey their own message to Maori. Whereas the government and missionaries often used their newspapers as an educational tool -to inform Maori of British and later New Zealand laws and customs, the Kingitanga countered this with arguments for self-determination. Maori newspapers eagerly reported on events from overseas that showed groups such as the Irish challenging British sovereignty to obtain home rule.\n\nIn the 1830s Te Atua Wera started the Papahurihia Faith in opposition to the missionaries. It mixed Christian, Judaic and Māori customary influences. They held services on Saturday and called themselves Hurai or Jews. Te Atua Wera reverted to the more customary role of a tohunga figure by the late 1830s. Te Atua Wera taught that heaven was a place where there was happiness, no cold or hunger with an abundance of flour, sugar, muskets, ships, murder and voluptuousness.\n\nFrom the time of their arrival in New Zealand, Māori lived in tribes that functioned independently under the leadership of their own chiefs. However, by the 1850s Māori were faced with increasing numbers of British settlers, political marginalisation and growing demand from the Crown to purchase their lands. From about 1853 Māori began reviving the ancient tribal \"runanga\" or chiefly war councils where land issues were raised and in May 1854 a large meeting—attracting as many as 2000 Māori leaders—was held at Manawapou in south Taranaki where speakers urged concerted opposition to selling land. Inspired by a trip to England during which he had met Queen Victoria, Te Rauparaha's son, Tamihana Te Rauparaha, used the \"runanga\" to promote the idea of forming a Māori kingdom, with one king ruling over all tribes. The \"kotahitanga\" or unity movement was aimed at bringing to Māori the unity that was an obvious strength among the Europeans. It was believed that by having a monarch who could claim status similar to that of Queen Victoria, Māori would be able to deal with Pākehā (Europeans) on equal footing. It was also intended to establish a system of law and order in Māori communities to which the Auckland government had so far shown little interest.\n\nSeveral North Island candidates who were asked to put themselves forward declined, \nbut in February 1857 Wiremu Tamihana, a chief of the Ngāti Hauā \"iwi\" in eastern Waikato, proposed the elderly and high-ranking Waikato chief Te Wherowhero as an ideal monarch and despite his initial reluctance he was crowned at Ngaruawahia in June 1858, later adopting the name Pōtatau Te Wherowhero or simply Pōtatau. Though there was widespread respect for the movement's efforts in establishing a \"land league\" to slow land sales, Pōtatau's role was strongly embraced only by Waikato Māori, with \"iwi\" of North Auckland and south of Waikato showing him scant recognition. Over time the King Movement came to have a flag, a council of state, a code of laws, a \"King's Resident Magistrate\", police, a bank, a surveyor and a newspaper, \"Te Hokioi\", all of which gave the movement the appearance of an alternative government.\n\nPōtatau was succeeded at his death in 1860 by Matutaera Tāwhiao, whose 34-year reign coincided with the military invasion of the Waikato, which was partly aimed at crushing the Kingitanga movement, with the government viewing it as a challenge to the supremacy of the British monarchy. Five Māori monarchs have subsequently held the throne, including Dame Te Atairangikaahu, who reigned for 40 years until her death in 2006. Her son Tūheitia is the current king. The historic traditions such as the poukai (annual visits by the monarch to marae) and the koroneihana (coronation celebrations) continue.\n\nToday, the Māori monarch is a non-constitutional role with no legal power from the perspective of the New Zealand government. Reigning monarchs retain the position of paramount chief of several important tribes and wield some power over these, especially within Tainui.\n\nThe records of early European visitors suggest that Māori children were indulged and led a rather carefree life, full of play. An early French explorer, Julien Crozet, commented that ‘[the women] seemed to be good mothers and showed affection for their offspring. I have often seen them play with the children, caress them, chew the fern root, pick at the stringy parts, and then take it out of their mouth to put it into that of their nurslings. The men were also very fond of and kind to their children.’ French missionary Jean-Simon Bernard wrote, disapprovingly, in 1844: ‘The children here are completely free; the parents never do anything to them. They never beat them and do not allow anyone else to beat them.’ \n\nHistorian Paul Moon writes of reports by missionaries of young girls being forced into the sex trade by their families with the object of obtaining valuable and scarce English goods in the 1820s. He describes how, when a new ship arrived, the fathers came to take girls as young as 10 out of school. Moon says that infanticide was widespread in Maori settlements—particularly the killing of baby girls, slaves captured in battle or half-caste children. Census figures in the 19th century showed a marked male/female imbalance throughout the North Island amongst Māori children. The 1857-8 Maori census recorded 32,329 males and only 23,928 females.\n\nThe killing of children could be the take (cause) of war. In 1815 two Ngāti Maniapoto boys were killed by the north Taranaki Ngati Tama iwi while they were visiting friends at Motuawa near the Mokau heads. This led to a Ngāti Maniapoto reprisal raid when warriors pretended to be peaceful visitors and launched a surprise attack on Ngati Tama.\n\nThe concept of whāngai (adopting or fostering children) has been, and still is, important within Māori whānau. It is the practice of raising nieces, nephews, cousins and other wider-family members as if they were members of the immediate family. Whāngai are adopted children who are raised with a whānau, most often as another member of that whānau, like a brother or sister.\n\nFrom 1978 to 1987 the Māori child-homicide rate was 1.15 times the non-Māori rate. However, between 1991 and 2000, the Māori rate rose to more than 3.5 times the non-Māori rate and from 2001 to 2005 the Māori child-homicide rate was around 2.4 times that of non-Māori. As part of a response to these statistics, national Māori child-advocacy organisation Te Kāhui Mana Ririki was formed in 2008. Te Kahui Mana Ririki has commissioned research into traditional Māori parenting in order to tackle child abuse in the Māori community.\n\nFace carving/tattooing was a traditional practice especially by men of rank but also by women. The facial tattoo gives details of the wearers lineage status, origin and possibly exploits. Prior to the arrival of Europeans tattooing was a sacred activity with many rituals.\n\nLater in their desire to obtain European muskets and powder in the 1820s, northern Māori produced a profusion of tattooed severed heads for sale to traders. At least two different methods of preserving heads were used. The head was severed from the body and emptied of its contents, with the nostrils and inside of the skull stuffed with flax. At the neck the skin was sewn together to allow a passage for the hand. Then it was rolled up in leaves and steamed at a low to moderate heat until all the moisture had gone. The head was either smoked over a fire or left in the air to dry. This caused the flesh to become hard and tough. The facial features, hair, and teeth were as perfect as in life, nor did they decay. Various reasons have been put forward for the rationale behind the traditional use of dried dead heads. One possibility is that it was a reminder of the deceased, another as a trophy made from the heads of slain enemies. Enemies' heads were displayed on poles as a macabre totem of victory. A third possibility was that it was a ritualistic way of capturing the enemies' mana, as heads of chiefs in particular were very tapu. Heads might be returned in an effort to settle a tribal disagreement, but they were never traded. Northern Māori quickly learnt that missionaries were repulsed by dried heads and hid them from view. In the 1820s, one European – Craik – was left with the impression that northern Māori had gone to war with the specific purpose of obtaining heads to trade for gunpowder. Another Māori offered to go and shoot some people who had killed his son if the European would give him some gunpowder to obtain heads. Māori quickly changed a centuries-old sacred practice to meet the demands for dried heads. The demand for military hardware by Māori seemed to override any older traditional practices or beliefs. In 1824 a French captain obtained an imperfect smoked head (it had been partly chewed by a dog) in exchange for one pound of gunpowder.\n\nThe normal Māori method of travel was on foot. The North Island had an extensive network of single lane one metre wide tracks that traversed beaches, plains, valleys and mountain passes. Some of these tracks were used by many iwi and were considered neutral territory. Missionaries who travelled with Māori guides found that at river crossings canoes were left for the use of any traveller. Between 1840 and 1850 numbers of explorers, artists, government officials including Governor Grey traveled inland with the aid of Maori guides. The guides carried heavy loads and would carry Europeans across creeks. Crossing swamps was common. Although they carried some food they relied on purchasing basic foodstuffs such as potatoes or native pigeons from Maori settlements. The most popular payment was in tobacco which was in great demand. In more remote areas travelers sometimes found Maori living by themselves and growing a few potatoes.\n\nCanoes (\"waka)\" were used extensively. These ranged from small river-going boats, to the large \"waka taua\" sea-going war vessels carrying up to 80 paddlers, and up to long Waka were used extensively for long range travel down the east coast and to cross Cook Strait. In 1822-23 Te Rauparaha who had established a base by capturing Kapiti Island, reconnoitered the upper South Island in waka before launching a seaborne invasion the following year against Ngai Tahu and Rangitane iwi. Te Rauparahaa later hired a European ship to attack Akoroa Harbour. Henry Williams who followed several war parties reported as many as 50 waka taua travelling together at one time, although he reported they only went out to sea in relatively calm weather. From 1835 large numbers of European ships entered the Bay of Islands every year with Henry Williams reporting an average of 70-80 ships per year. Many Māori men worked on the ships, with a reported average of eight Māori seamen per whaling ship. 10m long whaleboats began to be used by Māori. They could be both rowed and sailed. In the 1850s as Māori with the active encouragement of Grey embraced trade were gradually able to develop a large fleet of small trading schooners and similar craft. All the initial European centres had been supported by Maori. In Auckland and Northland Māori dominated shipping trade. In 1851 51 vessels were registered and 30 smaller vessels licensed. By 1857 there were 37 schooners. The fleet increased steadily during the Tasman trade boom of 1853–56. Māori paid customs duties to the government and invested heavily in vessels, so suffered considerably when a dramatic market slump hit New Zealand especially effecting the Auckland -Waikato- Hauraki area. During the musket war period and for a time afterwards, Maori, isolated from their tribal support by these devastating conflicts, hid in isolated places, living off patches of vegetables they grew in tiny gardens. This practice was very common in Taranaki which had been devastated by Waikato attacks in particular. European explorers, such as Dieffenbach, often stumbled upon these survivors while exploring. He described these whare as hotbeds for rats and vermin.\n\nThe traditional Māori whare continued to be used in rural areas in particular well into the post contact period. They were usually very small with a dirt floor and full of vermin, especially fleas. In winter a central fire was lit that filled the whare with smoke which slowly filtered through the roof. Even as late as 1849 George Cooper the assistant private secretary to George Grey described a village in the relatively affluent lower Eastern Waihou River area as \"a wretched place, containing about a dozen miserable raupo huts all tumbling to pieces\". 11. In the 19th century settlements were hapu-based, and 5 buildings became standardized-the sleeping whare, Kauta or communal cookhouse/shelter, whata or wood store, pataka or storehouse and increasingly from the 1870s wharepuni or community meeting house. Significant finance and mana was invested in increasingly elaborate meeting houses which became a source of hapu or iwi pride and prestige. A meeting house was likely to have outside carvings and increasingly as European tools were used, intricate interior carving and woven panels depicting tribal history. Rotorua became a centre of carving excellence under the encouragement of the Māori MPs in the Young Māori party. Intinerant specialist carvers travelled widely, employing their skills in many locations. Meeting houses became places for tribal celebrations or political meetings, especially after the 1860s Land Wars. They were a place to display largesse and enhance mana with elaborate feasts and entertainment. By the 20th century Wharepuni were common and averaged 18–24m long by 8m wide. There were no Māori buildings of this size in pre European days.\nAs Māori became familiar with European building construction and design they incorporated features such as chimneys and fireplaces and made use of bigger doorways and windows as well as sawn timber but even by the turn of the 19th century toilet facilities were often primitive, despite the urgings of the Māori MPs Pomare and Ngata who worked hard to improve the standard of Māori dwellings over their many years in office.\n\nFrom the early sealing days Māori working in sealing camps in the South Island had adopted European style clothing. Traditional clothing made from flax and dog skins had gone out of common use by 1850 everywhere. This type of clothing took a long time to make and did not offer much protection or warmth. European clothing had become widely available from itinerant peddlers who also sold pipes, tobacco, axes, billies, buckets and other household items Māori could not make. The blanket was the most common item in use. It was worn as a kilt, cloak or shawl. Blankets were used at night to partly replace the fires lit inside a sleeping whare which, without chimneys, \"had a detrimental effect on eyesight and lungs\". From the end of the 19th century and continuing into the present, traditional clothing is only used on ceremonial occasions.\n\nMāori continued to experience significant cultural change during this century. In 1900 few Māori lived in urban settlements. It was rare for any Māori to live in a European settlement. This changed very slowly. There were only 1,766 Māori in Auckland in 1935. By 1936 only 11.2% of Māori lived in urban areas. By 1945 this had risen to 19% and by 1971 to 68%. These changes reflect a significant alteration in the basis for income and employment-from working on hapu-based rural land to working mainly in construction, freezing works or labouring. The dominant factors influencing this shift were the burgeoning Māori population and the inability of the land to support the increasing population. During the 1930s and 1940s MP Ngata had passed land legislation to help Māori make better use of their remaining tribal land. Māori were handicapped in using and developing the land for modern agriculture as much Māori land was steep, remote, erosion prone with high rainfall. European farmers who owned their land freehold mechanized to gain higher productivity, using bank loans for the new equipment. Māori were unable to gain loans as their land was generally tribal land and could not be used for securing individual loans. Leasing land to European farmers gave Māori a steady income but this was spread among many people. \nMāori farming was often based on a different system of values and not driven by European goals of efficiency and high productivity.\n\nApart from jobs, another attraction to urban migration were the monetary, recreational and lifestyle attractions of the city. Many Māori felt that success lay in the city rather than the country. King describes this as a \"fantasy contagion-the realty did not live up to the myth but this did not stop the fantasy or the migration\".\nOther changes were a rising birth rate. In 1955, the Māori birth rate was nearly double the European rate at 43.6 compared to 26 per 1000. At the same time Māori had less qualifications. In 1956 6.5% of Māori held professional, managerial or clerical jobs compared to 26.7% non Māori. As a result, only 3.36% of Māori earned 700 pounds or more per annum compared to 18.6% for non Māori.\nMāori were significantly impacted by changing economic circumstances such as the drop in wool prices. This made Māori more vulnerable to economic and social deprivation. King says that the lower Māori educational attainment lead to lower income jobs, which led to lower income, poor housing, and poor health, which in turn led to higher rates of crime.\n\nThese ingredients were potential causes of racial tension. They were seen by the wider community as \"Māori problems\". By the 1970s and 1980s enough urbanized Māori had reached positions of influence to bring about a gradual but radical change to the thinking of governments. Their advocacy was underscored by an increasing willingness to use vigorous protest to push Mana Māori. Young urban radicals beat up a group of University students taking a comical view of Māori dance. Protestors occupied Bastion Point which was claimed as Māori land and resisted police arrest. In Raglan local Māori protesters reclaimed ownership of land used as an airstrip and golf course.\n\nEducated urban Māori advocated the teaching of Māori language and the inclusion of a Māori point of view in all aspects of education.\nMāori began to express their ideas in new political movements with Māori voters switching from supporting the Labour party to alternatives such as the Māori lead New Zealand First party in 1992. The introduction of MMP (Mixed Member Proportional) elections in 1996 had the effect of giving minority groups of any shades, more influence. The 1996 election produced 14 Māori MPs with 3 in cabinet. Māori MP Winston Peters, was the deputy Prime minister. This gave Māori an unprecedented voice in the nation's political executive.\nThis position set high expectations for positive results from the Treaty of Waitangi Tribunal which was set up to investigate Māori grievances against historical New Zealand governments in relation to the treaty. From the early 1990s a series of favourable outcomes from the treaty tribunal resulted in a large flow of capital in the form of land, primary resources and cash from the government to various Māori iwi and hapu. The largest tribal deals approached $1 billion although many were far smaller. This gave iwi and hapu organizations a source of financial security they had not had previously. To 2013 the total paid by government exceeds $4 billion. These resulted in more cohesive tribal organization as all assets went to tribal or hapu organizations. In 2012 it was estimated that the total value of Māori controlled assets was about $400 billion.\n\nFrom the early 1970s a new generation of radicals arose demanding more Māori influence. Amongst the demands were for increased \"tino rangatiratanga\". The expression, an abstraction of the word for aristocracy, had been coined by Henry Williams in the Treaty of Waitangi to convey the idea of \"chieftainship\". However, the term was often used by Māori to express the idea of political rights for all Māori not just the rangatira class, or the idea of Māori sovereignty or Māori independence.\n\nThe most appropriate venue for any Māori cultural event is a \"marae\", which is an enclosed area of land where a meeting house or \"wharenui\" (literally \"big house\") stands. A \"marae\" is the centre for much of Māori community life. Generally the Māori language is used in ceremonies and speeches, although translations and explanations are provided when the primary participants are not Māori speakers. Increasingly, New Zealand schools and universities have their own \"marae\" to facilitate the teaching of Māori language and culture.\n\nThe \"marae\" is a communal ceremonial centre where meetings and ceremonies take place in accordance with traditional protocols. The \"marae\" symbolises group unity and generally consists of an open cleared area in front of a large carved meeting house, along with a dining hall and other facilities necessary to provide a comfortable stay for visiting groups. On the marae official functions take place including formal welcomes, celebrations, weddings, christenings, reunions, and \"tangihanga\" (funerals). The older people have the authority on the marae, and they impart, primarily through oral tradition, traditions and cultural practices to the young people. These include genealogy, spirituality, oratory, and politics, and arts such as music composition, performance, weaving, or carving.\n\nThe details of the protocols, called \"tikanga\" or \"kawa\", vary by iwi but in all cases locals and visitors have to respect certain rules especially during the rituals of encounter. When a group of people come to stay on a marae, they are considered \"manuhiri\" (guests) while the hosts of the marae are known as \"tangata whenua\". Should other groups of manuhiri arrive, the \"manuhiri\" who arrived previously are considered \"tangata whenua\" for the purposes of formally welcoming the new group.\n\nAlthough marae have modern cooking facilities, the traditional \"hāngi\" is still used to provide meals for large groups because the food it produces is considered flavourful. The hāngi consists of a shallow hole dug in the ground, in which a fire is prepared and stones are placed on the top. When the stones are hot, prepared food is placed on top of them, meat first and then vegetables such as the kūmara, potatoes and pumpkin. The hāngi is then covered with leaves or mats woven out of harakeke flax, or wet sacks, and soil is then heaped over the hāngi to seal in the heat to cook the food.\n\nLike in pre-European times, marae continue to be the location of many ceremonial events, including birthdays, weddings, and anniversaries. The most important event located at marae are tangihanga. Tangihanga are the means by which the dead are farewelled and the surviving family members supported in Māori society. As indicated by Ka'ai and Higgins, \"the importance of the tangihanga and its central place in marae custom is reflected in the fact that it takes precedence over any other gathering on the marae\" (p. 90).\n\nThe history of individual tribal groups is kept by means of narratives, songs and chants, hence the importance of music, story and poetry. Oratory, the making of speeches, is especially important in the rituals of encounter, and it is regarded as important for a speaker to include allusions to traditional narrative and to a complex system of proverbial sayings, called \"whakataukī\". Oral traditions include songs, calls, chants, haka and formalised speech patterns that recall the history of the people.\n\nSignificant Māori cultural events or activities include:\n\n\nFilms that feature Māori themes and culture include:\n\nThe novels of Witi Ihimaera and the short stories of Patricia Grace provide an insider's view of the culture. \"The Bone People\" a novel by Keri Hulme, won the Booker Prize for Fiction in 1985. Jacqueline Sturm was the first Māori woman to complete an undergraduate university degree, at Victoria University College, followed by an MA in Philosophy. Sidney Moko Mead wrote \"Tikanga Maori: Living by Maori Values\", which provides a thorough introduction about the Māori way of doing things, both in the past and present.\n\nMāori take part fully in New Zealand's sporting culture with both the national Rugby league and Rugby Union teams have featured many Māori players, and other sports also feature many Māori players. There are also national Māori rugby union, rugby league and cricket teams, which play in international competitions, separate from the main national ones.\n\nKi-o-rahi and tapawai are two sports of Māori origin. Ki-o-rahi got an unexpected boost when McDonald's chose it to represent New Zealand.\n\nMāori Television is a New Zealand TV station broadcasting programmes that tries to make a significant contribution to the revitalisation of \"te reo\" and \"tikanga Māori\". Funded by the New Zealand Government, the station started broadcasting on 28 March 2004 from a base in Newmarket.\n\nTe Reo is the station's second channel, launched 28 March 2008. Te Reo is presented in 100% Māori language with no advertising or subtitles. It features special tribal programming with a particular focus on new programming for the fluent audience.\n\n"}

For example, \"kappa\" (sometimes called \"isokappa\") is still used at markets to measure exactly 5 liters of potatoes. When ordering firewood, some customers (and even dealers) use \"syli\" to refer to a cubic meter, but some old people use the term to refer to various much larger amounts of firewood.\n\nMost Finnish obsolete units of measurement were identical to Swedish units of measurement, including units of length being based on the Swedish \"foot\" (29.69 cm) that was defined in 1605, since Finland was part of Sweden from the Middle Ages to 1809, but later some Russian units were also used.\n\nThe measurements were first standardized by law in 1665 and were revised in 1735. Before this, measurements often varied between towns.

However, nowadays the proverb \"mitata Porvoon mitalla\" (to measure in Porvoo units) has a positive meaning of measuring in excess or generously.\n\nCertain units were standardized to the metric system in 1861, and Finland fully converted to the metric system in 1880.\n\n\nObsolete:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "320082", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=320082", "title": "Old French", "text": "Old French\n\nOld French (, , ; Modern French: ) was the language spoken in Northern France from the 8th century to the 14th century. \nIn the 14th century, these dialects came to be collectively known as the \"langue d'oïl\", contrasting with the \"langue d'oc\" or Occitan language in the south of France. The mid-14th century is taken as the transitional period to Middle French, the language of the French Renaissance, specifically based on the dialect of the Île-de-France region.\n\nThe place and area where Old French was spoken natively roughly extended to the northern half of the Kingdom of France and its vassals (including parts of the Angevin Empire, which during the 12th century remained under Anglo-Norman rule), and the duchies of Upper and Lower Lorraine to the east (corresponding to modern north-eastern France and Belgian Wallonia), but the influence of Old French was much wider, as it was carried to England, Sicily and the Crusader states as the language of a feudal elite and of commerce.\n\nThe areal of Old French in contemporary terms corresponded to the northern parts of the Kingdom of France (including Anjou and Normandy, which in the 12th century were ruled by the Plantagenet kings of England), Upper Burgundy and the duchy of Lorraine. The Norman dialect was also spread to England and Ireland, and during the crusades, Old French was also spoken in the Kingdom of Sicily, and in the Principality of Antioch and the Kingdom of Jerusalem in the Levant.\nAs part of the emerging Gallo-Romance dialect continuum, the \"langues d'oïl\" were contrasted with the \"langue d'oc\" (the emerging Occitano-Romance group, at the time also called Provençal), adjacent to the Old French area in the south-west, and with the Gallo-Italic group to the south-east. The Franco-Provençal group developed in Upper Burgundy, sharing features with both French and Provençal; it may have begun to diverge from the \"langue d'oïl\" as early as the 9th century, and is attested as a distinct Gallo-Romance variety by the 12th century.\n\nDialects or variants of Old French included:\nSome modern languages are derived from Old French dialects other than Classical French, which is based on the Île-de-France dialect. They include\nAngevin, Berrichon, Bourguignon-Morvandiau, Champenois, Franc-Comtois, Gallo, Lorrain, Norman, Picard, Poitevin, Saintongeais and Walloon.\n\nBeginning with Plautus’s time (254–184 ), one can see phonological changes between Classical Latin and what is called Vulgar Latin, the common spoken language of the Western Roman Empire. Vulgar Latin differed from Classical Latin in phonology and morphology as well as exhibiting lexical differences. However they were mutually intelligible until the 7th century when Classical Latin 'died' as a daily spoken language, and had to be learned as a second language (though it was long thought of as the formal version of the spoken language). Vulgar Latin was the ancestor of the Romance languages, including Old French.\n\nSome Gaulish words influenced Vulgar Latin and, through this, other Romance languages. For example, classical Latin \"equus\" was uniformly replaced in Vulgar Latin by \"caballus\" ‘nag, work horse’, derived from Gaulish \"caballos\" (cf. Welsh , Breton ), giving Modern French \"cheval\", Occitan \"caval\" (\"chaval\"), Catalan \"cavall\", Spanish \"caballo\", Portuguese \"cavalo\", Italian \"cavallo\", Romanian \"cal\", and, by extension, English \"cavalry\".\nAn estimated 200 words of Gaulish etymology survive in modern French, for example \"chêne\" ‘oak tree’ and \"charrue\" ‘plough’.\n\nWithin historical phonology and studies of language contact, various phonological changes have been posited as caused by a Gaulish substrate, although there is some debate. One of these is considered certain, because this fact is clearly attested in the Gaulish-language epigraphy on the pottery found at la Graufesenque ( 1st century). There, the Greek word \"paropsid-es\" (written in Latin) appears as \"paraxsid-i\". The consonant clusters /ps/ and /pt/ shifted to /xs/ and /xt/, e.g. Latin \"capsa\" > \"*kaxsa\" > \"caisse\" ( Italian \"cassa\") or \"captīvus\" > \"*kaxtivus\" > OF \"chaitif\" (mod. \"chétif\"; cf. Irish \"cacht\" ‘servant’; ≠ Italian \"cattiv-ità\", Portuguese \"cativo\", Spanish \"cautivo\"). This phonetic evolution is parallel to the shift of the Latin cluster /kt/ in Old French (Latin \"factum\" > \"fait\", ≠ Italian \"fatto\", Portuguese \"feito\", Spanish \"hecho\"; or \"lactem\"* > \"lait\", ≠ Italian \"latte\", Portuguese \"leite\", Spanish \"leche\").\n\nThe Celtic Gaulish language is thought to have survived into the 6th century in France, despite considerable cultural Romanization. Coexisting with Latin, Gaulish helped shape the Vulgar Latin dialects that developed into French, with effects including loanwords and calques (including \"oui\", the word for \"yes\"), sound changes shaped by Gaulish influence, and influences in conjugation and word order. Recent computational studies suggest that early gender shifts may have been motivated by the gender of the corresponding word in Gaulish.\n\nThe pronunciation, vocabulary, and syntax of the Vulgar Latin spoken in Roman Gaul in Late Antiquity was modified by the Old Frankish language, spoken by the Franks who settled in Gaul from the 5th century and conquered the entire Old French-speaking area by the 530s.\nThe name \"français\" itself is derived from the name the Franks.\n\nThe Old Frankish language had a definitive influence on the development of Old French, which partly explains why the earliest attested Old French documents are older than the earliest attestations in other Romance languages (e.g. Strasbourg Oaths, Sequence of Saint Eulalia). It is the result of an earlier gap created between Classical Latin and its evolved forms, which slowly reduced and eventually severed the intercomprehensibility between the two. The Old Low Franconian influence is also believed to be responsible for the differences between the \"langue d′oïl\" and the \"langue d′oc\" (Occitan), being that various parts of Northern France remained bilingual between Latin and Germanic for some time, and these areas correspond precisely to where the first documents in Old French were written. \n\nThis Germanic language shaped the popular Latin spoken here and gave it a very distinctive identity compared to the other future Romance languages. The very first noticeable influence is the substitution of the Latin melodic accent by a Germanic stress and its result was diphthongization, differentiation between long and short vowels, the fall of the unaccented syllable and of the final vowels:\n\nAdditionally, two phonemes that had long since died out in Vulgar Latin were reintroduced: and (> OF \"g(u)-\", ONF \"w-\" cf. Picard \"w-\"):\n\nOn the opposite, the Italian, Portuguese and Spanish words of Germanic origin borrowed from French or directly from Germanic retain ~ , e.g. It, Sp. \"guerra\" ‘war’, alongside in French \"guerre\"). In these examples, we notice a clear consequence of bilingualism, that sometimes even changed the first syllable of the Latin words. One example of a Latin word influencing an Old Low Franconian loan is \"framboise\" ‘raspberry’, from OF \"frambeise\", from OLF \"*brāmbesi\" ‘blackberry’ (cf. Dutch \"braambes\", \"braambezie\"; akin to German \"Brombeere\", English dial. \"bramberry\") blended with LL \"fraga\" or OF \"fraie\" ‘strawberry’, which explains the replacement > and in turn the final \"-se\" of \"framboise\" added to OF \"fraie\" to make \"freise\", modern \"fraise\" (≠ Wallon \"frève\", Romanian \"fragă\", Romansh \"fraja\", Italian \"fragola\", \"fravola\" ‘strawberry’).\n\nPope (1934) estimated that perhaps still 15% of the vocabulary of modern French derives from Germanic sources (while the proportion was larger in Old French, because the French language borrowed heavily from Latin and Italian).\nAt the third Council of Tours in 813, priests were ordered to preach in the vernacular language (either Romance or Germanic), since the common people could no longer understand formal Latin.\n\nThe earliest documents said to be written in the Gallo-Romance that prefigures French – after the Reichenau and Kassel glosses (8th and 9th centuries) – are the Oaths of Strasbourg (treaties and charters into which King Charles the Bald entered in 842):\n\nThe second-oldest document in Old French is the Eulalia sequence, which is important for linguistic reconstruction of Old French pronunciation due to its consistent spelling.\n\nThe royal House of Capet, founded by Hugh Capet in 987, inaugurated the development of northern French culture in and around Île-de-France, which slowly but firmly asserted its ascendency over the more southerly areas of Aquitaine and Tolosa (Toulouse). The Capetians' \"langue d'oïl\", the forerunner of modern standard French, did not begin to become the common speech of all of France, however, until after the French Revolution.\n\nIn the Late Middle Ages, the Old French dialects diverged into a number of distinct \"langues d'oïl\", among which Middle French proper was the dialect of the Île-de-France region.\nDuring the Early Modern period, French now becomes established as the official language of the Kingdom of France throughout the realm, also including the \"langue d'oc\"-speaking territories in the south. \nIt was only in the 17th to 18th centuries – with the development especially of popular literature of the \"Bibliothèque bleue\" – that a standardized Classical French spread throughout France alongside the regional dialects.\n\nThe material and cultural conditions in France and associated territories around the year 1100 triggered what Charles Homer Haskins termed the \"Renaissance of the 12th century\", resulting in a profusion of creative works in a variety of genres. Old French gave way to Middle French in the mid-14th century, paving the way for early French Renaissance literature of the 15th century.\n\nThe earliest extant French literary texts date from the ninth century, but very few texts before the 11th century have survived. The first literary works written in Old French were saints' lives. The \"Canticle of Saint Eulalie\", written in the second half of the 9th century, is generally accepted as the first such text.\n\nAt the beginning of the 13th century, Jean Bodel, in his \"Chanson de Saisnes\", divided medieval French narrative literature into three subject areas: the Matter of France or Matter of Charlemagne; the Matter of Rome (romances in an ancient setting); and the Matter of Britain (Arthurian romances and Breton lais). The first of these is the subject area of the \"chansons de geste\" (\"songs of exploits\" or \"songs of (heroic) deeds\"), epic poems typically composed in ten-syllable assonanced (occasionally rhymed) \"laisses\". More than one hundred \"chansons de geste\" have survived in around three hundred manuscripts. \nThe oldest and most celebrated of the \"chansons de geste\" is \"The Song of Roland\" (earliest version composed in the late 11th century).\n\nBertrand de Bar-sur-Aube in his \"Girart de Vienne\" set out a grouping of the \"chansons de geste\" into three cycles: the \"Geste du roi\" centering on Charlemagne, the \"Geste de Garin de Monglane\" (whose central character was William of Orange), and the \"Geste de Doon de Mayence\" or the \"rebel vassal cycle\", the most famous characters of which were Renaud de Montauban and Girart de Roussillon.\nA fourth grouping, not listed by Bertrand, is the \"Crusade cycle\", dealing with the First Crusade and its immediate aftermath.\n\nJean Bodel's other two categories—the \"Matter of Rome\" and the \"Matter of Britain\"—concern the French romance or \"roman\". Around a hundred verse romances survive from the period 1150–1220. From around 1200 on, the tendency was increasingly to write the romances in prose (many of the earlier verse romances were adapted into prose versions), although new verse romances continued to be written to the end of the 14th century. \nThe most important romance of the 13th century is the \"Romance of the Rose\" which breaks considerably from the conventions of the chivalric adventure story.\n\nMedieval French lyric poetry was indebted to the poetic and cultural traditions in Southern France and Provence—including Toulouse, Poitiers, and the Aquitaine region—where \"langue d'oc\" was spoken (Occitan language); in their turn, the Provençal poets were greatly influenced by poetic traditions from the Hispano-Arab world. \nThe Occitan or Provençal poets were called troubadours, from the word \"trobar\" \"to find, to invent\". Lyric poets in Old French are called \"trouvères\".\n\nBy the late 13th century, the poetic tradition in France had begun to develop in ways that differed significantly from the troubadour poets, both in content and in the use of certain fixed forms. The new poetic (as well as musical: some of the earliest medieval music has lyrics composed in Old French by the earliest composers known by name) tendencies are apparent in the \"Roman de Fauvel\" in 1310 and 1314, a satire on abuses in the medieval church, filled with medieval motets, lais, rondeaux and other new secular forms of poetry and music (mostly anonymous, but with several pieces by Philippe de Vitry, who would coin the expression \"ars nova\" to distinguish the new musical practice from the music of the immediately preceding age). The best-known poet and composer of \"ars nova\" secular music and chansons of the incipient Middle French period was Guillaume de Machaut.\n\nDiscussions about the origins of non-religious theater (\"théâtre profane\") – both drama and farce—in the Middle Ages remain controversial, but the idea of a continuous popular tradition stemming from Latin comedy and tragedy to the 9th century seems unlikely.\nMost historians place the origin of medieval \"drama\" in the church's liturgical dialogues and \"tropes\". Mystery plays were eventually transferred from the monastery church to the chapter house or refectory hall and finally to the open air, and the vernacular was substituted for Latin. In the 12th century one finds the earliest extant passages in French appearing as refrains inserted into liturgical dramas in Latin, such as a Saint Nicholas (patron saint of the student clercs) play and a Saint Stephen play.\nAn early French dramatic play is \"Le Jeu d'Adam\" (c. 1150) written in octosyllabic rhymed couplets with Latin stage directions (implying that it was written by Latin-speaking clerics for a lay public).\nA large body of fables survive in Old French; these include (mostly anonymous) literature dealing with the recurring trickster character of Reynard the Fox. Marie de France was also active in this genre, producing the \"Ysopet\" (Little Aesop) series of fables in verse. Related to the fable was the more bawdy \"fabliau\", which covered topics such as cuckolding and corrupt clergy. These \"fabliaux\" would be an important source for Chaucer and for the Renaissance short story (\"conte\" or \"nouvelle\").\n\nOld French was constantly changing and evolving. However, the form in the late 12th century, as attested in a great deal of mostly poetic writings, can be considered standard. The writing system at this time was more phonetic than that used in most subsequent centuries. In particular, all written consonants (including final ones) were pronounced, except for \"s\" preceding non-stop consonants and \"t\" in \"et\", and final \"e\" was pronounced . The phonological system can be summarised as follows:\n\nNotes:\n\nIn Old French, the nasal vowels were not separate phonemes but only allophones of the oral vowels before a nasal consonant. The nasal consonant was fully pronounced; \"bon\" was pronounced (Modern French ). Nasal vowels were present even in open syllables before nasals where Modern French has oral vowels, as in \"bone\" (Modern French \"bonne\" ).\n\nNotes:\n\nNotes:\n\nIn addition to diphthongs, Old French had many instances of hiatus between adjacent vowels because of the loss of an intervening consonant. Manuscripts generally do not distinguish hiatus from true diphthongs, but modern scholarly transcription indicates it with a diaeresis, as in Modern French:\n\nOld French maintained a two-case system, with a nominative case and an oblique case, for longer than did some other Romance languages like Spanish and Italian. Case distinctions, at least in the masculine gender, were marked on both the definite article and the noun itself. Thus, the masculine noun \"li veisins\" \"the neighbour\" (Latin \"vicīnus\" > Proto-Romance *\"vecínos\" > OF \"veisins\" ; Modern French \"le voisin\" ) was declined as follows:\n\nIn later Old French, the distinctions had become moribund. As in most other Romance languages, it was the oblique case form that usually survived to become the Modern French form: \"l'enfant\" \"the child\" represents the old oblique (Latin accusative \"īnfāntem\"); the Old French nominative was \"li enfes\" (Latin \"īnfāns\"). There are some cases with significant differences between nominative and oblique forms (derived from Latin nouns with a stress shift between the nominative and other cases) in which either it is the nominative form that survives or both forms survive with different meanings:\n\nIn a few cases in which the only distinction between forms was the nominative \"-s\" ending, the \"-s\" was preserved in spelling to distinguish otherwise-homonymous words. An example is \"fils\" \"son\" (< Latin nominative \"fīlius\"), spelled to distinguish it from \"fil\" \"wire\". In this case, a later spelling pronunciation has resulted in the modern pronunciation (earlier ).\n\nAs in Spanish and Italian, the neuter gender was eliminated, and most old neuter nouns became masculine. Some Latin neuter plurals were reanalysed as feminine singulars: Latin \"gaudium\" was more widely used in the plural form \"gaudia\", which was taken for a singular in Vulgar Latin and ultimately led to modern French \"la joie\", \"joy\" (feminine singular).\n\nNouns were declined in the following declensions:\n\nClass I is derived from the Latin first declension. Class Ia mostly comes from Latin feminine nouns in the third declension. Class II is derived from the Latin second declension. Class IIa generally stems from second-declension nouns ending in \"-er\" and from third-declension masculine nouns; in both cases, the Latin nominative singular did not end in \"-s\", which is preserved in Old French.\n\nThe classes show various analogical developments: \"-es\" from the accusative instead of \"-∅\" (\"-e\" after a consonant cluster) in Class I nominative plural (Latin \"-ae\"), \"li pere\" instead of \"*li peres\" (Latin \"illi patres\") in Class IIa nominative plural, modelled on Class II, etc.\n\nClass III nouns show a separate form in the nominative singular that does not occur in any of the other forms. IIIa nouns ended in \"-ātor\", \"-ātōrem\" in Latin and preserve the stress shift; IIIb nouns also had a stress shift, from \"-ō\" to \"-ōnem\". IIIc nouns are an Old French creation and have no clear Latin antecedent. IIId nouns represent various other types of third-declension Latin nouns with stress shift or a change of consonant (\"soror\", \"sorōrem; īnfāns, īnfāntem; presbyter, presbyterem; seiior, seiiōrem; comes, comitem).\n\nRegular feminine forms of masculine nouns are formed by adding an \"-e\" to the masculine stem unless the masculine stem already ends in \"-e\". For example, \"bergier\" (shepherd) becomes \"bergiere\" (Modern French \"berger\" and \"bergère\").\n\nAdjectives agree in terms of number, gender and case with the noun that they are qualifying. Thus, a feminine plural noun in the nominative case requires any qualifying adjectives to be feminine, plural and nominative. For example, in \"femes riches\", \"riche\" has to be in the feminine plural form.\n\nAdjectives can be divided into three declensional classes:\n\nClass I adjectives have a feminine singular form (nominative and oblique) ending in \"-e\". They can be further subdivided into two subclasses, based on the masculine nominative singular form. Class Ia adjectives have a masculine nominative singular ending in \"-s\":\n\nFor Class Ib adjectives, the masculine nominative singular ends in \"-e\", like the feminine. There are descendants of Latin second- and third-declension adjectives ending in \"-er\" in the nominative singular:\n\nFor Class II adjectives, the feminine singular is not marked by the ending \"-e\":\nAn important subgroup of Class II adjectives is the present participial forms in \"-ant\".\n\nClass III adjectives have a stem alternation, resulting from stress shift in the Latin third declension and a distinct neuter form: \n\nIn later Old French, Classes II and III tended to be moved across to Class I, which was complete by Middle French. Modern French thus has only a single adjective declension, unlike most other Romance languages, which have two or more.\n\nVerbs in Old French show the same extreme phonological deformations as other Old French words. Morphologically, however, Old French verbs are extremely conservative in preserving intact most of the Latin alternations and irregularities that had been inherited in Proto-Romance. Old French has much less analogical reformation than Modern French has and significantly less than the oldest stages of other languages (such as Old Spanish) despite the fact that the various phonological developments in Gallo-Romance and Proto-French led to complex alternations in the majority of commonly-used verbs.\n\nFor example, the Old French verb \"laver\" \"to wash\" (Latin \"lavāre\") is conjugated \"je lef\", \"tu leves\", \"il leve\" in the present indicative and \"je lef\", \"tu les\", \"il let\" in the present subjunctive, in both cases regular phonological developments from Latin indicative \"lavō\", \"lavās\", \"lavat\" and subjunctive \"lavem\", \"lavēs\", \"lavet\". The following paradigm is typical in showing the phonologically regular but morphologically irregular alternations of most paradigms:\nModern French, on the other hand, has \"je lave\", \"tu laves\", \"il lave\" in both indicative and subjunctive, reflecting significant analogical developments: analogical borrowing of unstressed vowel /a/, analogical \"-e\" in the first singular (from verbs like \"j'entre\", with a regular \"-e\" ) and wholesale replacement of the subjunctive with forms modelled on \"-ir\"/\"-oir\"/\"-re\" verbs. All serve to eliminate the various alternations in the Old French verb paradigm. Even modern \"irregular\" verbs are not immune from analogy: For example, Old French \"je vif\", \"tu vis\", \"il vit\" (\"vivre\" \"to live\") has yielded to modern \"je vis\", \"tu vis\", \"il vit\", eliminating the unpredictable \"-f\" in the first-person singular.\n\nThe simple past also shows extensive analogical reformation and simplification in Modern French, as compared with Old French.\n\nThe Latin pluperfect was preserved in very early Old French as a past tense with a value similar to a preterite or imperfect. For example, the Sequence of Saint Eulalia (878 AD) has past-tense forms such as \"avret\" (< Latin \"habuerat\"), \"voldret\" (< Latin \"voluerat\"), alternating with past-tense forms from the Latin perfect (continued as the modern \"simple past\"). Old Occitan also preserved this tense, with a conditional value; Spanish still preserves this tense (the \"-ra\" imperfect subjunctive), as does Portuguese (in its original value as a pluperfect indicative).\n\nIn Latin, stress was determined automatically by the number of syllables in a word and the weight (length) of the syllables. That resulted in certain automatic stress shifts between related forms in a paradigm, depending on the nature of the suffixes added. For example, in \"pensō\" \"I think\", the first syllable was stressed, but in \"pensāmus\" \"we think\", the second syllable was stressed. In many Romance languages, vowels diphthongized in stressed syllables under certain circumstances but not in unstressed syllables, resulting in alternations in verb paradigms: Spanish \"pienso\" \"I think\" vs. \"pensamos\" \"we think\" (\"pensar\" \"to think\"), or \"cuento\" \"I tell\" vs. \"contamos\" \"we tell\" (\"contar\" \"to tell\").\n\nIn the development of French, at least five vowels diphthongized in stressed, open syllables. Combined with other stress-dependent developments, that yielded 15 or so types of alternations in so-called strong verbs in Old French. For example, diphthongized to before nasal stops in stressed, open syllables but not in unstressed syllables, yielding \"aim\" \"I love\" (Latin \"amō\") but \"amons\" \"we love\" (Latin \"amāmus\").\n\nThe different types are as follows:\nIn Modern French, the verbs in the \"-er\" class have been systematically levelled. Generally, the \"weak\" (unstressed) form predominates, but there are some exceptions (such as modern \"aimer\"/\"nous aimons\"). The only remaining alternations are in verbs like \"acheter\"/\"j'achète\" and \"jeter\"/\"je jette\", with unstressed alternating with stressed and in (largely-learned) verbs like \"adhérer/j'adhère\", with unstressed alternating with stressed . Many of the non-\"er\" verbs have become obsolete, and many of the remaining verbs have been levelled. A few alternations remain, however, in what are now known as irregular verbs, such as \"je tiens\", \"nous tenons\"; \"je dois\", \"nous devons\" and \"je meurs\", \"nous mourons\".\n\nSome verbs had a more irregular alternation between different-length stems, with a longer, stressed stem alternating with a shorter, unstressed stem. That was a regular development stemming from the loss of unstressed intertonic vowels, which remained when they were stressed:\n\nThe alternation of \"je desjun\", \"disner\" is particularly complicated; it appears that \"disiēiūnāre\" > Western Romance > (preliminary intertonic loss) > (triphthong reduction) > (metaphony) > (further intertonic loss and other proto-French developments). Both stems have become full verbs in Modern French: \"déjeuner\" \"to have lunch\" and \"dîner\" \"to dine\". Furthermore, \"déjeuner\" does not derive directly from \"je desjun\" (< \"*disi(ēi)ūnō\", with total loss of unstressed \"-ēi-\"). Instead, it comes from Old French \"desjeüner\", based on the alternative form \"je desjeün\" (< \"*disiē(i)ūnō\", with loss of only \"-i-\", likely influenced by \"jeûner\" \"to fast\" < Old French \"jeüner\" < \"je jeün\" \"I fast\" < \"iē(i)ūnō\": \"iē-\" is an initial rather than intertonic so the vowel \"-ē-\" does not disappear).\n\nNon-finite forms:\nAuxiliary verb: \"avoir\"\n\nNon-finite forms:\nAuxiliary verb: \"avoir\"\n\nNon-finite forms:\nAuxiliary verb: \"estre\"\n\nNon-finite forms:\nAuxiliary verb: \"avoir\"\n\nNon-finite forms:\nAuxiliary verb: \"avoir\"\n\nAdverbs, prepositions, conjunctions and interjections are generally invariable, one notable exception being the adverb \"tot\", like Modern French \"tout\": all, every.\n\n\n\n"}

Located in the major port city of Ostia, this open-air market was essential for Rome as a place of varying and exotic goods from foreign lands. Merchants gathered here to sell anything from grain and shipping services to elephants and giraffes.\n\nRebuilt in the 2nd century AD, The Forum of Corporations was also representative of the many diverse cultures that made up the Roman Empire. Oil importers, grain importers, rope-makers, and ship builders from corporations spanning across the empire came here to benefit from Ostia’s positioning at the mouth of the Tiber River which easily facilitated the importation and transportation of goods into the empire.\n\nThe forum was enclosed by a wall made of brick surfaced with stucco and measured 100 meters by 80 meters. A total of 61 rooms, each which was 4 meters by 4 meters, opened up to the forum. The rooms were separated by a wooden partition and were arranged based on geographical origin of the merchant or business, the majority which were based in Africa.\n\nThere is also a temple in the middle of the forum to Annona Augusta, the Divinity of Imperial Supplies, or Ceres Augusta. This temple served as a guild temple and reflects the role of religion in all aspect of Roman life, including business.\n\nThe most notable detail of the Forum of Corporations are the intricate black and white mosaics that lie in front of each shop. These mosaics indicated the professional associations of each vendor as well as inspired a sense of nostalgia for the distant homes of each of the merchants. The forum was adjacent to the theater of Ostia and people would also pass through the forum before and after performances.\n\nThe Piazzale dell Corporazioni was often the home of the offices for approximately 40 guilds. These guilds were religious associations that dealt mainly with grain trade and navigation through Ostia, which served as the main food supply source for Rome. There were six divisions of guilds: Grain Shipping and Related Services, Commerce, Transport, Trades, Civil Service, Cults (Hermansen). The guilds represented a bridge between international and domestic relations through trading, worship and banquets.\n\nMany guilds used the temple in the center of the Forum of Corporations as a meeting place where they would worship, and hold banquets and assemblies. The various perennial religious ceremonies that they celebrated were performed at the temple.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5265708", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5265708", "title": "Public participation", "text": "Public participation\n\nPublic participation (citizen participation) is a political principle or practice, and may also be recognised as a right. The terms public participation, often called P2 by practitioners, is sometimes used interchangeably with the concept or practice of stakeholder engagement and/or popular participation.\n\nGenerally public participation seeks and facilitates the involvement of those potentially affected by or interested in a decision. This can be in relation to individuals, governments, institutions, companies or any other entities that affect public interests. The principle of public participation holds that those who are affected by a decision have a right to be involved in the decision-making process. Public participation implies that the public's contribution will influence the decision.\n\nPublic participation may be regarded as a way of empowerment and as vital part of democratic governance.\n\nIn the context of knowledge management the establishment of ongoing participatory processes is seen by some in the facilitator of collective intelligence and inclusiveness, shaped by the desire for the participation of the whole community or society.\n\nPublic participation is part of \"people centred\" or \"human centric\" principles, which have emerged in Western culture over the last thirty\nyears, and has had some bearings of education, business, public policy and international relief and development programs. Public participation is advanced by the humanist movements. Public participation may be advanced as part of a \"people first\" paradigm shift. In this respect public participation may challenge the concept that \"big is better\" and the logic of centralized\nhierarchies, advancing alternative concepts of \"more heads are better than one\" and arguing that public participation can sustain productive and durable change.\n\nThe role of public participation in economic and human development was enshrined in the 1990 African Charter for Popular Participation in Development and Transformation.\n\nIn 1990 practitioners established the International Association for Public Practitioners in order to respond to the increasing interest in the practice, and in turn established the International Association for Public Participation (IAP2). The practice is well established globally and the International Association of Public Participation now has affiliate organizations across the globe.\n\nParticipatory budgeting is a process of democratic deliberation and decision-making, in which ordinary city residents decide how to allocate part of a municipal or public budget. Participatory budgeting is usually characterized by several basic design features: identification of spending priorities by community members, election of budget delegates to represent different communities, facilitation and technical assistance by public employees, local and higher level assemblies to deliberate and vote on spending priorities, and the implementation of local direct-impact community projects.\nParticipatory budgeting may be used by towns and cities around the world, and has been widely publicised in Porto Alegre, Brazil, were the first full participatory budgeting process was developed starting in 1989.\n\nIn economic development theory, there is a school of participatory development. The desire to increase public participation in humanitarian aid and development has led to the establishment of a numerous context-specific, formal methodologies, matrices, pedagogies and ad hoc approaches. These include conscientization and praxis; Participatory action research (PAR), rapid rural appraisal (RRA) and participatory rural appraisal (PRA); appreciation influence control analysis (AIC); \"open space\" approaches; Objectives Oriented Project Planning (ZOPP); vulnerability analysis and capacity analysis.\n\nIn some countries public participation has become a central principle of public policy making. In the UK it has been observed that all levels of government have started to build citizen and stakeholder engagement into their policy-making processes. This may involve large-scale consultations, focus group research, online discussion forums, or deliberative citizens' juries. There are many different public participation mechanisms, although these often share common features (for a list over 100, and a typology of mechanisms, see Rowe and Frewer, 2005).\n\nPublic participation is viewed as a tool, intended to inform planning, organising or funding of activities. Public participation may also be used to measure attainable objectives, evaluate impact, and identify lessons for future practice.\n\nIn the United States public participation in administrative rulemaking refers to the process by which proposed rules are subject to public comment for a specified period of time. Public participation is typically mandatory for rules promulgated by executive agencies of the US government. Statutes or agency policies may mandate public hearings during this period.\n\nIn recent years loss of public trust in authorities and politicians has become a widespread concern in many democratic societies. Public participation is a regarded as one potential solution to the crisis in public trust and governance, particularly in the UK, Europe, and other democracies. The idea is that public should be involved more fully in the policy process in that authorities seek public views and participation, instead of treating the public as simply passive recipients of policy decisions.\n\nThe underlying assumption by political theorists, social commentators, and even politicians is that public participation increase public trust in authorities, improving citizen political efficacy, enhancing democratic ideals and even improving the quality of policy decisions. However, the assumed benefits of public participation in restoring public trust are yet to be confirmed.\n\nPublic participation may also be viewed as accountability enhancing. The argument being that public participation can be a means for the participating communities to hold public authorities accountable for implementation. In the United Kingdom citizens are used to ensure the fair and humane detention of prisoners. Volunteers comprise the Independent Monitoring Board that reports on the fair and humane detention of prisoners and detainees.\n\nIn recent years public participation has become to be seen as a vital part of addressing environmental problems and bringing about sustainable development. In this context the limits of solely relying on technocratic bureaucratic monopoly of decision making, and it is argued that public participation allows governments to adopt policies and enact laws that are relevant to communities and take into account their needs.\n\nPublic participation is recognised as an environmental principle, see Environmental Principles and Policies, and has been enshrined in the Rio Declaration.\n\nWith growing complexities of the environmental issues, public participation has come to the fore in academic analysis concerning the contemporary debates about environmental governance.\n\nThere have emerged a number of arguments in favour of a more participatory approach, which stress that public participation is a crucial element in environmental governance that contributes to better decision making. It is recognised that environmental problems cannot be solved by government alone. Participation in environmental decision-making effectively links the public to environmental governance. By involving the public, who are at the root of both causes and solutions of environmental problems, in environmental discussions, transparency and accountability are more likely to be achieved, thus secures the democratic legitimacy of decision-making that good environmental governance depends on. Arguably, a strong public participation in environmental governance could increase the commitment among stockholders, which strengthens the compliance and enforcement of environmental laws. GIS can provide a valuable tool for such work (see GIS and environmental governance). In addition, some opponents argue that the right to participate in environmental decision-making is a procedural right that \"can be seen as part of the fundamental right to environmental protection\". From this ethical perspective, environmental governance is expected to operate within a framework coinciding the \"constitutional principle of fairness (inclusive of equality)\", which inevitably requires the fulfillment of \"environmental rights\" and ultimately calls for the engagement of public. Further, in the context of considerable scientific uncertainties surrounding environmental issues, public participation helps to counter such uncertainties and bridges the gap between scientifically-defined environmental problems and the experiences and values of stakeholders. Through joint effort of the government and scientists in collaboration with the public, better governance of environment is expected to be achieved by making the most appropriate decision possible.\n\nAlthough broad agreements exist, the notion of public participation in environmental decision-making has been subject to a sustained critique concerning the real outcome of participatory environmental governance. Critics argue that public participation tends to focus on reaching a consensus between actors who share the same values and seek the same outcomes. However, the uncertain nature of many of the environmental issues would undermine the validity of public participation, given that in many cases the actors come to the table of discussion hold very different perceptions of the problem and solution which are unlikely to be welded into a consensus due to the incommensurability of different positions. This may run the risk of expert bias, which generates further exclusion as those who are antagonistic to the consensus would be marginalised in the environmental decision-making process, which violates the assumed advantage of participatory approach to produce democratic environmental decisions. This raises the further question of whether consensus should be the measure of a successful outcome of participation. As Davies suggests, participative democracy could not guarantee the substantive environmental benefits 'if there are competing views of what the environment should be like and what it is valuable for'. Consequently, who should be involved at what points in the process of environmental decision-making and what is the goal of this kind of participation become central to the debates on public participation as a key issue in environmental governance.\n\nCitizen science is a coined term commonly used to describe the participation of non-scientists in scientific research.\n\nLiz Richardson, a Visiting Fellow in the Centre for Analysis of Social Exclusion (CASE) at the London School of Economics and an editor for the journal Local Government Studies, has long advocated for the greater inclusion of non-professional scientists in policy research. She emphasizes that it is academia's responsibly to facilitate the \"democratization of policy research\" noting several benefits of having citizens involved in not just the contribution of data, but also the framing and development of research itself (2014). She notes that the biggest disadvantage of citizen science is the reliance on using citizens as only contributing members of the scientific endeavors and pushes for a more community-based participatory research method which would include laypeople in the entirety of the research process while emphasizing the scientific method popularized by citizen science.\n\nIn their 2017 article, Colin Chapman and Crona Hodges outline what they believe to be the key to success in applying citizen science to policy development: data which is \"suitable, robust, and of a known quality for evidence-based policy making\" (2017). They identified several barriers to applying citizen science to policy development including a lack of suitability between the data collected and the policy in question and skepticism regarding the data collected by non-experts.\n\nIn some jurisdictions the right to public participation is enshrined by law. The right to public participation may also be conceived of as human right, or as manifestation of the right to freedom of association and freedom of assembly. As such the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark and Sweden, have public participation and freedom of information provisions in their legal systems since before the Middle Ages. Democracy and public participation are closely connected democratic societies have incorporated public participation rights into their laws for centuries. For example, in the US the right to petition has been part of the first Amendment of the US constitution since 1791. More recently, since the 1970s in New Zealand numerous laws (e.g.: health, local government, environmental management) require government officials to \"consult\" those affected by a matter and take their views into consideration when making decisions.\n\nEffective public participation depends on the public having accessing to accurate and comprehensive information. Hence laws regarding public participation often deal with the issue of the right to know, access of information and freedom of information.\n\nThe right to participation may also be advanced in the context of equality and group rights, meant to ensure equal and full participation of a designated group in society. For example, in the context of disabled people.\n\nThe Rio Declaration of 1992 enshrines public participation in its 27 principles. Principle 10 states that \"environmental issues are best handled with participation of all concerned citizens, at the relevant level\". The Rio Declaration continues, drawing a close link between access to information and public participation: \n\nAt the national level, each individual shall have appropriate access to information concerning the environment that is held by public authorities, including information on hazardous materials and activities in their communities, and the opportunity to participate in decision-making processes. States shall facilitate and encourage public awareness and participation by making information widely available. Effective access to judicial and administrative proceedings, including redress and remedy, shall be provided.\n\nThe 2006 Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recognised that \"disability results from the interaction between persons with impairments and attitudinal and environmental barriers that hinders their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others\" and that \"persons with disabilities continue to face barriers in their participation as equal members of society.\"\n\nThe Convention makes participation of disabled one of its principles, stating \"The principles of the present Convention shall be:...Full and effective participation and inclusion in society;\", subsequently enshrining the right of disabled to participate fully and equally in the community, education, all aspect of life (in the context of habilitation and rehabilitation), political and public life, cultural life, leisure and sports.\n"}

Many of these were not easily beatmixed, so DJs started to laboriously edit songs by splicing reel-to-reel tape copies, making their own, unique versions that were better structured for a dancefloor.\n\n1977 saw the creation of the first remix service, Disconet. These companies gathered DJs and producers together to create monthly, promotional-only compilation albums containing re-edits, remixes, or medleys that were intended specifically for club DJs.\n\nBy 1994, there was a saturation of remix services, most of which typically remixed the same tracks as their competitor. At that point, the RIAA got involved and began notifying remix services that they needed to have clear permission from publishers or face litigation. Coincidentally, the services that survived the fallout (Ultimix, X-mix, Hot Tracks, Wicked Mix) all featured remixers that currently had radio mix-shows. In exchange for allowing remixing of certain tracks, remixers could be counted on by the labels to help \"break\" the new song they were trying to promote by featuring the track heavily in their mix-show.\n\nWhile some services decided to ultimately cease operations, mixes began to pop up at most DJ record shops. It should be noted that an effort was made by one of the larger services to clear a way for all services to become legal. The idea was for every service to pay either a flat fee or a percentage of sales to a commission who would then allocate the money to the publishers whose tracks were used. This idea was rebuffed by the labels.\n\nOver the years, the remixes featured on these compilations have varied from simple edits, adding a mixable intro and outro to a song, or full-fledged, digital, multi-track remixes that barely resemble the original track. Many remix services have focused on a specific style of music (such as hip-hop or rock) or type of remix (such as house mixes of pop hits).\n\nAs of 2006, there have been over 50 official remix services worldwide with at least as many spinoffs, although most of these companies (including Disconet) have long since folded due to financial or legal reasons. All remix services are required to get the original record label or artists' permission to edit and release a track, but many bootleg services exist that do not.\n\nMost of these companies required a DJ subscription agreement to buy the records or CDs, and each issue was typically limited in quantity from 100 to several thousand. Many of these compilations have become sought after collectors items as a result. Once in a while a remix service version of a song is released commercially by the artist's record label, but 99% of remix service mixes are sold only to DJs on the compilations.\n\nSome of these companies helped launch the careers of many well-known remixers/producers.\n\nChris Cox (formerly of Thunderpuss) worked for Hot Tracks (now Select Mix). Armand Van Helden created mixes for Mega-Mixx and X-Mix. Markus Schulz, C. L. McSpadden and Aaron \"The Pimp\" Scofield made mixes for Powerhouse - after the company folded Scofield and McSpadden offered remixes through Culture Shock, while Schulz releases remixes and original compositions through his own Coldharbour Recordings label. Ben Liebrand released numerous remixes with DMC. A few companies/artists besides Schulz have also developed their own commercial record labels to release new tracks.\n\nThe UK-based DMC remix service probably has the most members in the world, with offices in nearly every country, and that they sponsor the yearly World DJ Championships as well as releasing many commercial compilations.\n\nSome of the better known remix services (all US-based unless stated):\n\nMany remix services issues also contain megamixes. A megamix contains multiple songs mixed together, sometimes in rapid succession. They can consist of a single artist (just Madonna songs, etc.) or multiple artists. Some may follow a theme as well (Christmas, only songs that have \"queen\" in the title, only David Morales mixes, etc.). Often megamixes are also called medleys.\n\nMegamixes are also commonly found on commercial releases, sometimes using the same mix previously released to DJs on a remix service. The earlier Jive Bunny & The Mastermixers series of 50s and 60s megamixes were originally released on the Music Factory Mastermix service.\n\nAmong modern services, Ultimix is well known for producing several megamixes every year based on popular songs of the year (\"flashback medleys\") as well as some single artist megamixes. Culture Shock has the \"Hit \"AC\" Megamixes\" on their main series derived from their now defunct radio show, as well as a satellite series entitled \"Use Alternative Routes\" which contains Modern Rock megamixes. Similarly, the UK-based DMC and Music Factory Mastermix remix services frequently include megamixes on their issues.\n\nMastermix digital web site\n\n"}

{"id": "3252046", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3252046", "title": "Rota Fortunae", "text": "Rota Fortunae\n\nIn medieval and ancient philosophy the Wheel of Fortune, or Rota Fortunae, is a symbol of the capricious nature of Fate. The wheel belongs to the goddess Fortuna (Greek equivalent Tyche) who spins it at random, changing the positions of those on the wheel: some suffer great misfortune, others gain windfalls. Fortune appears on all paintings as a woman, sometimes blindfolded, \"puppeteering\" a wheel.\n\nThe origin of the word is from the \"wheel of fortune\" - the zodiac, referring to the Celestial spheres of which the 8th holds the stars, and the 9th is where the signs of the zodiac are placed. The concept was first invented in Babylon and later developed by the ancient Greeks.\n\nThe concept somewhat resembles the \"Bhavacakra\", or Wheel of Becoming, depicted throughout Ancient Indian art and literature, except that the earliest conceptions in the Roman and Greek world involve not a two-dimensional wheel but a three-dimensional sphere, a metaphor for the world. It was widely used in the Ptolemaic perception of the universe as the zodiac being a wheel with its \"signs\" constantly turning throughout the year and having effect on the world's fate (or fortune).\nVettius Valens, a second century BC astronomer and astrologer, wrote:\n\nIn the same century, the Roman tragedian Pacuvius wrote:\n\nThe idea of the rolling ball of fortune became a literary topos and was used frequently in declamation. In fact, the \"Rota Fortunae\" became a prime example of a trite topos or meme for Tacitus, who mentions its rhetorical overuse in the \"Dialogus de oratoribus\".\n\nThe goddess and her Wheel were eventually absorbed into Western medieval thought. The Roman philosopher Boethius (c. 480-524) played a key role, utilizing both her and her Wheel in his \"Consolatio Philosophiae\". For example, from the first chapter of the second book:\n\nI know the manifold deceits of that monstrous lady, Fortune; in particular, her fawning friendship with those whom she intends to cheat, until the moment when she unexpectedly abandons them, and leaves them reeling in agony beyond endurance.\n\nHaving entrusted yourself to Fortune's dominion, you must conform to your mistress's ways. What, are you trying to halt the motion of her whirling wheel? Dimmest of fools that you are, you must realize that if the wheel stops turning, it ceases to be the course of chance.\"\n\nThe Wheel was widely used as an allegory in medieval literature and art to aid religious instruction. Though classically Fortune's Wheel could be favourable and disadvantageous, medieval writers preferred to concentrate on the tragic aspect, dwelling on downfall of the mighty - serving to remind people of the temporality of earthly things. In the morality play \"Everyman\" (c. 1495), for instance, Death comes unexpectedly to claim the protagonist. Fortune's Wheel has spun Everyman low, and Good Deeds, which he previously neglected, are needed to secure his passage to heaven.\n\nGeoffrey Chaucer used the concept of the tragic Wheel of Fortune a great deal. It forms the basis for the \"Monk's Tale\", which recounts stories of the great brought low throughout history, including Lucifer, Adam, Samson, Hercules, Nebuchadnezzar, Belshazzar, Nero, Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar and, in the following passage, Peter I of Cyprus.\n\n~ Geoffrey Chaucer, \"The Canterbury Tales\", The Monk's Tale\n\nFortune's Wheel often turns up in medieval art, from manuscripts to the great Rose windows in many medieval cathedrals, which are based on the Wheel. Characteristically, it has four shelves, or stages of life, with four human figures, usually labeled on the left \"regnabo\" (I shall reign), on the top \"regno\" (I reign) and is usually crowned, descending on the right \"regnavi\" (I have reigned) and the lowly figure on the bottom is marked \"sum sine regno\" (I am without a kingdom). Dante employed the Wheel in the \"Inferno\" and a \"Wheel of Fortune\" trump-card appeared in the Tarot deck (circa 1440, Italy).\n\nIn the medieval and renaissance period, a popular genre of writing was \"Mirrors for Princes\", which set out advice for the ruling classes on how to wield power (the most famous being \"The Prince\" by Niccolò Machiavelli). Such political treatises could use the concept of the Wheel of Fortune as an instructive guide to their readers. John Lydgate's \"Fall of Princes\", written for his patron Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester is a noteworthy example.\n\nMany Arthurian romances of the era also use the concept of the Wheel in this manner, often placing the Nine Worthies on it at various points.\n\n...fortune is so variant, and the wheel so moveable, there nis none constant abiding, and that may be proved by many old chronicles, of noble Hector, and Troilus, and Alisander, the mighty conqueror, and many mo other; when they were most in their royalty, they alighted lowest. \n~ Lancelot in Thomas Malory's \"Le Morte d'Arthur\", Chapter XVII.\n\nLike the Mirrors for Princes, this could be used to convey advice to readers. For instance, in most romances, Arthur's greatest military achievement - the conquest of the Roman Empire - is placed late on in the overall story. However, in Malory's work the Roman conquest and high point of King Arthur's reign is established very early on. Thus, everything that follows is something of a decline. Arthur, Lancelot and the other Knights of the Round Table are meant to be the paragons of chivalry, yet in Malory's telling of the story they are doomed to failure. In medieval thinking, only God was perfect, and even a great figure like King Arthur had to be brought low. For the noble reader of the tale in the Middle Ages, this moral could serve as a warning, but also as something to aspire to. Malory could be using the concept of Fortune's Wheel to imply that if even the greatest of chivalric knights made mistakes, then a normal fifteenth-century noble didn't have to be a paragon of virtue in order to be a good knight.\n\nThe Wheel of Fortune motif appears significantly in the \"Carmina Burana\" (or \"Burana Codex\"), albeit with a postclassical phonetic spelling of the genitive form \"Fortunae\". Excerpts from two of the collection's better known poems, \"\"Fortuna Imperatrix Mundi\" (Fortune, Empress of the World)\" and \"\"Fortune Plango Vulnera\" (I Bemoan the Wounds of Fortune),\" read:\n\n\"\n\nFortune and her Wheel have remained an enduring image throughout history. Fortune's wheel can also be found in Thomas More's \"Utopia\".\n\nWilliam Shakespeare in \"Hamlet\" wrote of the \"slings and arrows of outrageous fortune\" and, of fortune personified, to \"break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel.\" And in \"Henry V\", Act 3 Scene VI are the lines:\n\nShakespeare also references this Wheel in \"King Lear\". The Earl of Kent, who was once held dear by the King, has been banished, only to return in disguise. This disguised character is placed in the stocks for an overnight and laments this turn of events at the end of Act II, Scene 2:\n\nIn Act IV, scene vii, King Lear also contrasts his misery on the \"wheel of fire\" to Cordelia's \"soul in bliss\".\n\nRosalind and Celia also discuss Fortune, especially as it stands opposed to Nature, in \"As You Like It\", Act I, scene ii.\n\nIn Anthony Trollope's novel \"The Way We Live Now\", the character Lady Carbury writes a novel entitled \"The Wheel of Fortune\" about a heroine who suffers great financial hardships.\n\nSelections from the \"Carmina Burana\", including the two poems quoted above, were set to new music by twentieth-century classical composer Carl Orff, whose well-known \"O Fortuna\" is based on the poem \"Fortuna Imperatrix Mundi\".\n\nFortuna does occasionally turn up in modern literature, although these days she has become more or less synonymous with Lady Luck. Her Wheel is less widely used as a symbol, and has been replaced largely by a reputation for fickleness. She is often associated with gamblers, and dice could also be said to have replaced the Wheel as the primary metaphor for uncertain fortune. In his novel, \"The Club Dumas\", Arturo Pérez-Reverte includes a wheel of fortune in one of the illustrations that accompany the text. Ignatius J. Reilly, the central protagonist of John Kennedy Toole's novel \"A Confederacy of Dunces\", states that he believes the Rota Fortunae to be the source of all men's fate.\n\nJerry Garcia recorded a song entitled \"The Wheel\" (co-written with Robert Hunter and Bill Kreutzmann) for his 1972 solo album \"Garcia\", and performed the song regularly with the Grateful Dead from 1976 onward. The song \"Wheel in the Sky\" by Journey from their 1978 release \"Infinity\" also touches on the concept through the lyrics \"Wheel in the sky keeps on turnin' / I don't know where I'll be tomorrow\". The song \"Throw Your Hatred Down\" by Neil Young on his 1995 album \"Mirror Ball\", recorded with Pearl Jam, has the verse \"The wheel of fortune / Keeps on rollin' down\". The Trip-Hop group Massive Attack refer to the Wheel of Fortune on their track \"Hymn Of The Big Wheel\" on the 1991 album Blue Lines.\n\nSeveral old folk tunes mention the wheel of fortune, most notably 'Fakenham Fair' with its chorus lyrics of 'So spin me around on the merry-go-round/Give the wheel of fortune a whirl'.\n\nVarious games of chance involve spinning a wheel marked with preset outcomes, mirroring the \"wheel of fortune\" concept. This is notably done on the long-running, internationally syndicated game show \"Wheel of Fortune\", where contestants win or lose money determined by the spin of the wheel. Such a wheel is also featured in the game show \"The Price Is Right\", in the \"Showcase Showdown\" segment. In the 1985 film \"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome\", such a wheel was used to determine punishments for criminals.\n\nThe 1994 film \"The Hudsucker Proxy\" refers often to the Rota Fortunae concept, especially in its use of circles as a visual motif. In the TV series \"Firefly\" (2002), the main character, Malcolm Reynolds, says \"The Wheel never stops turning, Badger\" to which Badger replies \"That only matters to the people on the rim\". In the science fiction TV series \"Farscape\", the third-season episode \"Self-Inflicted Wounds (Part 2): Wait for the Wheel\" has main character Crichton mention that his grandmother told him that fate was like a wheel, alternately bringing fortunes up and down.\n\nThe video game series character Kain (Legacy of Kain) used the wheel of fate. In the \"Fable\" video game series, the wheel of fortune appears twice, somehow perverted. The Wheel of Unholy Misfortune is a torture device in \"Fable II\". It is found in the Temple of Shadows in Rookridge. The Hero can use the wheel to sacrifice followers to the shadows. In \"Fable III\", Reaver's Wheel of Misfortune is a device that, once activated, sends to The Hero a round of random monsters.\n\nThe Wheel of Fortune is featured in a \"\" card by that name that forces all players to discard their hands and draw new ones.\n"}
{"id": "3538206", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3538206", "title": "Sallekhana", "text": "Sallekhana\n\nSallekhana (IAST: ), also known as Samlehna, Santhara, Samadhi-marana or Sanyasana-marana; is a supplementary vow to the ethical code of conduct of Jainism. It is the religious practice of voluntarily fasting to death by gradually reducing the intake of food and liquids. It is viewed in Jainism as the thinning of human passions and the body, and another means of destroying rebirth-influencing karma by withdrawing all physical and mental activities. It is not considered as a suicide by Jain scholars because it is not an act of passion, nor does it deploy poisons or weapons. After the \"sallekhana\" vow, the ritual preparation and practice can extend into years.\n\n\"Sallekhana\" is a vow available to both for Jain ascetics and householders. Historic evidence such as \"nishidhi\" engravings suggest \"sallekhana\" was observed by both men and women, including queens, in Jain history. However, in the modern era, death through \"sallekhana\" has been a relatively uncommon event.\n\nThere is debate about the practice from a right to life and a freedom of religion viewpoint. In 2015, the Rajasthan High Court banned the practice, considering it suicide. Later that year, the Supreme Court of India stayed the decision of the Rajasthan High Court and lifted the ban on \"Sallekhana\".\n\nThere are Five Great vows prescribed to followers of Jainism; \"Ahimsa\" (non-violence), \"Satya\" (not lying), \"Asteya\" (not stealing), \"Brahmacharya\" (chastity), and \"Aparigraha\" (non-possession). A further seven supplementary vows are also prescribed, which include three \"Gunavratas\" (merit vows) and four \"Shiksha vratas\" (disciplinary vows). The three \"Gunavratas\" are: \"Digvrata\" (limited movements, limiting one's area of activity), \"Bhogopabhogaparimana\" (limiting use of consumable and non-consumable things), and \"Anartha-dandaviramana\" (abstain from purposeless sins). The \"Shikshavratas\" include: \"Samayika\" (vow to meditate and concentrate for limited periods), \"Desavrata\" (limiting movement and space of activity for limited periods), \"Prosadhopavāsa\" (fasting for limited periods), and \"Atithi-samvibhag\" (offering food to the ascetic).\n\n\"Sallekhana\" is treated as a supplementary to these twelve vows. However, some Jain teachers such as Kundakunda, Devasena, Padmanandin, and Vasunandin have included it under \"Shikshavratas\".\n\n\"Sallekhana\" () means to properly 'thin out', 'scour out' or 'slender' the passions and the body through gradually abstaining from food and drink. \"Sallekhana\" is divided into two components: \"Kashaya Sallekhana\" (slenderising of passions) or \"Abhayantra Sallekhana\" (internal slendering) and \"Kaya Sallekhana\" (slenderising the body) or \"Bahya Sallekhana\" (external slendering). It is described as \"facing death voluntarily through fasting\". According to Jain texts, \"Sallekhana\" leads to \"Ahimsa\" (non-violence or non-injury), as a person observing \"Sallekhana\" subjugates the passions, which are the root cause of \"Himsa\" (injury or violence).\n\nWhile \"Sallekhana\" is prescribed for both \"householders\" and ascetics, Jain texts describe conditions when it is appropriate. It should not be observed by a householder without guidance of a Jain ascetic.\n\nSallekhana is always voluntary, undertaken after public declaration, and never assisted with any chemicals or tools. The fasting causes thinning away of body by withdrawing by choice food and water to oneself. As death is imminent, the individual stops all food and water, with full knowledge of colleagues and spiritual counsellor. In some cases, Jains with terminal illness undertake \"sallekhana\", and in these cases they ask for permission from their spiritual counsellor. For a successful \"sallekhana\", the death must be with \"pure means\", voluntary, planned, undertaken with calmness, peace and joy where the person accepts to scour out the body and focuses his or her mind on spiritual matters.\n\n\"Sallekhana\" differs from other forms of ritual deaths recognized in Jainism as appropriate. The other situations consider ritual death to be better for a mendicant than breaking his or her Five Great vows (\"Mahavrata\"). For example, celibacy is one of the Five vows, and ritual death is considered better than being raped or seduced or if the mendicant community would be defamed. A ritual death under these circumstances by consuming poison is believed to be better and allows for an auspicious rebirth.\n\nThe duration of the practice can vary from a few days to years. The sixth part of the \"Ratnakaranda śrāvakācāra\" describes \"Sallekhana\" and its procedure as follows— \n\nJain texts mention five transgressions (\"Atichara\") of the vow: the desire to be reborn as a human, the desire to be reborn as a divinity, the desire to continue living, the desire to die quickly, and the desire to live a sensual life in the next life. Other transgressions include: recollection of affection for friends, recollection of the pleasures enjoyed, and longing for the enjoyment of pleasures in the future.\n\nThe ancient Svetambara Jain text \"Acharanga Sutra\", dated to about 3rd or 2nd century BCE, describes three forms of \"Sallekhana\": the \"Bhaktapratyakhyana\", the \"Ingita-marana,\" and the \"Padapopagamana\". In \"Bhaktapratyakhyana\", the person who wants to observe the vow selects an isolated place where he lies on a bed made of straw, does not move his limbs, and avoids food and drink until he dies. In \"Ingita-marana\", the person sleeps on bare ground. He can sit, stand, walk, or move, but avoids food until he dies. In \"Padapopagamana\", a person stands \"like a tree\" without food and drink until he dies.\n\nAnother variation of \"Sallekhana\" is \"Itvara\" which consists of voluntarily restricting oneself in a limited space and then fasting to death.\n\nThe \"Acharanga Sutra\" () describes three forms of the practice. Early Svetambara text \"Shravakaprajnapti\" notes that the practice is not limited to ascetics. The Bhagavati Sūtra (2.1) also describes \"Sallekhana\" in great detail, as it was observed by Skanda Katyayana, an ascetic of Mahavira. The 4th century text \"Ratnakaranda śrāvakācāra,\" and the Svetambara text \"Nava-pada-prakarana,\" also provide detailed descriptions. The \"Nava-pada-prakarana\" mentions seventeen methods of \"voluntarily chosen death\", of which it approves only three as consistent with the teachings of Jainism. The practice is also mentioned in the 2nd century CE Sangam era poem \"Sirupanchamoolam\".\n\nThe \"Panchashaka\" makes only a cursory mention of the practice and it is not described in \"Dharmabindu\" – both texts by Haribhadra (). In the 9th century text \"Ādi purāṇa\" by Jinasena the three forms are described. \"Yashastilaka\" by Somadeva (10th century) also describes the practice. Other writers like Vaddaradhane (10th century) and Lalitaghate also describe the \"Padapopagamana\", one of its forms. Hemchandra () describes it in a short passage despite his detailed coverage of the observances of householders (\"Shravakachara\").\n\nAccording to \"Tattvartha Sutra\", \"a householder willingly or voluntary adopts \"Sallekhana\" when death is very near.\" According to the medieval era Jain text, \"Puruşārthasiddhyupāya\", both the ascetics and the householder should \"court voluntarily death at the end of life\", thinking that only sallekhana is a pious death. The \"Silappadikaram\" (Epic of the Anklet) by the Jain prince-turned-monk, Ilango Adigal, mentions \"Sallekhana\" by the Jain nun, Kaundi Adigal.\n\nIn South India, especially Karnataka, a memorial stone or footprint is erected to commemorate the death of person who observed \"Sallekhana\". This is known as \"Nishidhi\", \"Nishidige\" or \"Nishadiga\". The term is derived from the Sanskrit root \"Sid\" or \"Sad\" which means \"to attain\" or \"waste away\".\n\nThese \"Nishidhis\" detail the names, dates, the duration of the vow, and other austerities performed by the person who observed the vow. The earliest \"Nishidhis\" (6th to 8th century) mostly have an inscription on the rock without any symbols. This style continued until the 10th century when footprints were added alongside the inscription. After the 11th century, \"Nishidhis\" are inscribed on slabs or pillars with panels and symbols. These slabs or pillars were frequently erected in \"mandapa\"s (pillared pavilions), near \"basadi\" (temples), or sometimes as an inscription on the door frame or pillars of the temple.\n\nIn Shravanabelgola in Karnataka, ninety-three \"Nishidhis\" are found ranging from circa 6th century to the 19th century. Fifty-four of them belong to the period circa 6th to the 8th century. It is believed that a large number of \"Nishidhis\" at Shravanabelgola follow the earlier tradition. Several inscriptions after 600 CE record that Chandragupta Maurya () and his teacher Bhadrabahu observed the vow atop Chandragiri Hill at Sharavnabelagola. Historians such as R. K. Mookerji consider the accounts unproven, but plausible.\n\nAn undated inscription in old Kannada script is found on the \"Nishidhi\" from Doddahundi near Tirumakudalu Narasipura in Karnataka. Historians such as J. F. Fleet, I. K. Sarma, and E.P. Rice have dated it to 840 or 869 CE by its textual context. The memorial stone has a unique depiction in frieze of the ritual death (\"Sallekhana\") of King Ereganga Nitimarga I () of the Western Ganga Dynasty. It was raised by the king's son Satyavakya. In Shravanabelgola, the Kuge Brahmadeva pillar has a \"Nishidhi\" commemorating Marasimha, another Western Ganga king. An inscription on the pillar in front of Gandhavarna Basadi commemorates Indraraja, the grandson of the Rashtrakuta King Krishna III, who died in 982 after observing the vow.\n\nThe inscriptions in South India suggest \"sallekhana\" was originally an ascetic practice which later extended to Jain householders. Its importance as an ideal death in the spiritual life of householders ceased by about the 12th century. The practice was revived in 1955 by the Digambara monk Acharya Santisagara.\n\n\"Sallekhana\" is a respected practice in the Jain community. It has not been a \"practical or general goal\" among Svetambara Jains for many years. It was revived among Digambara monks. In 1955, Acharya Shantisagar, a Digambara monk took the vow because of his inability to walk without help and his weak eye-sight. In 1999, Acharya Vidyanand, another Digambara monk, took a twelve-year-long vow.\n\nBetween 1800 and 1992, at least 37 instances of \"Sallekhana\" are recorded in Jain literature. There were 260 and 90 recorded Sallekhana deaths among Svetambara and Digambara Jains respectively between 1993 and 2003. According to Jitendra Shah, the Director of L D Institute of Indology in Ahmedabad, an average of about 240 Jains practice \"Sallekhana\" each year in India. Most of them are not recorded or noticed. Statistically, \"Sallekhana\" is undertaken both by men and women of all economic classes and among the educationally forward Jains. It is observed more often by women than men.\n\nJain texts make a clear distinction between the \"Sallekhana\" and suicide. Its dualistic theology differentiates between soul and matter. Soul is reborn in the Jain belief based on accumulated karma, how one dies contributes to the karma accumulation, and a pious death reduces the negative karmic attachments. The preparation for \"sallekhana\" must begin early, much before the approach of death, and when death is imminent, the vow of \"Sallekhana\" is observed by progressively slenderising the body and the passions.\n\nThe comparison of \"Sallekhana\" with suicide is debated since the early time of Jainism. The early Buddhist Tamil epic \"Kundalakesi\" compared it to suicide. It is refuted in the contemporary Tamil Jain literature such as in \"Neelakesi\".\n\nProfessor S. A. Jain cites differences between the motivations behind suicide and those behind Sallekhana to distinguish them:\n\nChampat Rai Jain, a Jainist scholar wrote in 1934:\n\nModern era Indian activists have questioned this rationale, calling the voluntary choice of death as an evil similar to sati, and have attempted to legislate and judicially act against this religious custom. Article 21 of the Constitution of India, 1950, guarantees the right to life to all persons within the territory of India and its states. In \"Gian Kaur vs The State Of Punjab\", the state high court ruled, \"... 'right to life' is a natural right embodied in Article 21 but suicide is an unnatural termination or extinction of life and, therefore, incompatible and inconsistent with the concept of right to life\".\n\n\"Nikhil Soni vs Union of India\" (2006), a case filed in the Rajasthan High Court, citing the \"Aruna Ramchandra Shanbaug vs Union Of India\" case related to euthanasia, and the \"Gian Kaur\" case, argued, \"No person has a right to take his own life consciously, as the right to life does not include the right to end the life voluntarily.\" So the petitioner cited \"Sallekhana\" as a suicide and thus punishable under Section 309 (attempt to commit suicide). The case also extended to those who helped facilitate the deaths of individuals observing \"Sallekhana,\" finding they were culpable under Section 306 (abetment of suicide) with aiding and abetting an act of suicide. It was also argued that \"Sallekhana\" \"serves as a means of coercing widows and elderly relatives into taking their own lives\". An attempt to commit suicide was a crime under Section 309 of the Indian Penal Code.\n\nIn response, the Jain community argued that prohibiting the practice is a violation of their freedom of religion, a fundamental right guaranteed by Article 15 and Article 25 of the Constitution of India. The book \"Sallekhana Is Not Suicide\" by former Justice T. K. Tukol was widely cited in the court which opined that \"\"Sallekhana\" as propounded in the Jaina scriptures is not suicide.\"\n\nThe Rajasthan High Court stated that \"[The Constitution] does not permit nor include under Article 21 the right to take one's own life, nor can it include the right to take life as an essential religious practice under Article 25 of the Constitution\". It further added that it is not established that \"Sallekhana\" is an essential practise of Jainism and therefore not covered by Article 25 (1). So the High Court banned the practice in August 2015 making it punishable under Sections 306 (abetment of suicide) and 309 (attempt to commit suicide). Members of the Jain community held nationwide protest marches against the ban on \"Sallekhana\".\n\nAdvocate Suhrith Parthasarathy criticised the judgement of the High Court and wrote, \"\"Sallekhana\" is not an exercise in trying to achieve an unnatural death, but is rather a practice intrinsic to a person's ethical choice to live with dignity until death.\" He also pointed out that the Supreme Court in the \"Gian Kaur\" case explicitly recognises the right to live with human dignity within the ambit of right to life. He further cited that the Supreme Court wrote in the said case, \"[The right to life] may include the right of a dying man to also die with dignity when his life is ebbing out. But the right to die with dignity at the end of life is not to be confused or equated with the right to die an unnatural death curtailing the natural span of life.\"\n\nOn 31 August 2015, the Supreme Court admitted the petition by Akhil Bharat Varshiya Digambar Jain Parishad and granted leave. It stayed the decision of the High Court and lifted the ban on the practice.\n\nIn April 2017, the Indian parliament decriminalised suicide by passing the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017.\n\nThere are similar practices in other religions like Prayopavesa in Hinduism, and Sokushinbutsu in Buddhism.\n\nThe ancient and medieval scholars of Indian religions discussed suicide, and a person's right to voluntarily choose death. Suicide is broadly disapproved and discouraged by Buddhist, Hindu and Jaina texts. The \"Satapatha Brahmana\" of Hinduism, for example, in section 10.2.6 discusses the nature of cyclic life and rebirth, and concludes that \"therefore, one should not depart before one's natural lifespan\", states David Brick, an Indologist at the Yale University. However, for those who have renounced the world (sannyasi, sadhu, yati, bhikshu), the Indian texts discuss when ritual choice of death is appropriate and what means of voluntarily ending one's life are appropriate. The \"Sannyasa Upanishads\", for example, discuss many methods of religious death, such as slowing then stopping consumption of foods and drinks to death (similar to \"sallekhana\"), walking into a river and drowning, entering fire, path of the heroes, and the Great Journey.\n\nScholars disagree whether \"voluntary religious death\" discussed in Indian religions is same as other forms of suicide.\n\n\n"}

The semantics of logic refers to the approaches that logicians have introduced to understand and determine that part of meaning in which they are interested; the logician traditionally is not interested in the sentence as uttered but in the proposition, an idealised sentence suitable for logical manipulation.\n\nUntil the advent of modern logic, Aristotle's \"Organon\", especially \"De Interpretatione\", provided the basis for understanding the significance of logic. The introduction of quantification, needed to solve the problem of multiple generality, rendered impossible the kind of subject-predicate analysis that governed Aristotle's account, although there is a renewed interest in term logic, attempting to find calculi in the spirit of Aristotle's syllogistic but with the generality of modern logics based on the quantifier.\n\nThe main modern approaches to semantics for formal languages are the following:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "37818996", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37818996", "title": "Sex differences in schizophrenia", "text": "Sex differences in schizophrenia\n\nSex differences in schizophrenia are widely reported. Men and women exhibit different rates of incidence and prevalence, age at onset, symptom expression, course of illness, and response to treatment. Recent reviews of the literature suggest that understanding the implications of sex differences on schizophrenia may help inform individualized treatment and positively affect outcomes. \n\nFor both men and women, incidence of schizophrenia onset peaks at multiple points across the lifespan. For men, the highest frequency of incidence onset occurs in the early twenties and there is evidence of a second peak in the mid-thirties. For women, there is a similar pattern with peaks in the early twenties and middle age. Studies have also demonstrated a tertiary peak for women in the early sixties. Men have higher frequency rates of onset than women from the early twenties to middle age, and women have higher frequency rates of onset starting in late middle age. \n\nRecent studies of prevalence rates of schizophrenia estimate that the lifetime likelihood of developing the disorder is 0.3%-0.7%, and did not find evidence of sex differences. \n\nSymptom expression systematically differs between men and women. Women are more likely to experience high levels of depressive symptoms (i.e., low mood, anhedonia, fatigue) at illness onset and over the course of illness. Men are more likely to experience more negative symptoms than women at illness onset. There is conflicting evidence related to sex differences in the expression of positive symptoms. Some studies have found that women are more likely to experience positive symptoms. Other studies have found no significant sex differences in the expression of positive symptoms. Younger age of onset is also related to earlier hospitalizations in males and more acute symptom severity in women.\n\nAge at illness onset likely contributes to observed sex differences in course of illness and treatment outcomes. Increased negative and cognitive symptoms and poorer overall treatment outcomes are both related to younger age at onset, while fewer negative and cognitive symptoms are associated with older age at onset. These findings are consistent with the differences patterns of symptom expression observed in men and women and the relative age of onset for each gender. Men are more likely to experience poorer overall outcomes than women because of the relationship between younger age at onset and symptom severity.\n\nClinical trials examining sex differences in the efficacy of atypical antipsychotic medications found greater rates of symptom reduction in women compared to men. However, women are at a greater risk for experiencing weight gain and developing metabolic syndrome as a result of antipsychotic medication use.\n\nThe steroids and hormones associated with sex differentiation during fetal development have critical effects on neuronal development in humans, and there is evidence that these hormones have implications for sex differences in brain abnormalities observed in adults with schizophrenia. MRI studies have revealed more severe brain damage in men diagnosed with schizophrenia than women. Specifically, larger lateral and third ventricles and reduced volumes of critical regions such as the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortical regions have been observed in men. These brain abnormalities likely contribute to the observed short-term and long-term memory deficits in men diagnosed with schizophrenia. It has been hypothesized that estrogen may serve a protective role in female development, buffering against the development of pervasive damage to this region. Further support for this hypothesis derives from the observation of a third peak of onset for women after menopause, which is associated with a reduction of estrogen, and the increased response to treatment in pre-menopausal women compared to post-menopausal women. Additionally, there is evidence that estradiol may be an effective adjunct to antipsychotic medication in reducing psychotic symptoms.\n\nPremorbid social functioning and social cognition, robust predictors of relapse in this population, differ significantly between men and women. Men have poorer overall premorbid social functioning and social cognition, which is associated with higher rates of isolation, loneliness, and lower quality of life. Social cognitive and functional deficits are also related to the increased expression of negative symptoms observed in men. Additionally, these factors are also associated with reduced social network size and lower marriage rates in men with schizophrenia compared to women. Younger age at onset in men may also negatively impact community reintegration following the illness onset by delaying the development of life skills necessary to develop strong social support networks and foster self-perceptions of efficacy and agency.\n\nSubstance abuse is also highly correlated with poorer functional outcomes and can significantly influence the course of illness. Current research estimates that 36% of men have a history of illicit substance use versus 16% of women. Nicotine dependence is also highly prevalent in individuals with schizophrenia. An estimated 80% of individuals with schizophrenia smoke cigarettes compared to 20% of the general population. Men with schizophrenia are more likely to start smoking than women, but social factors associated with mental illness contributing to increased rate of smoking in both genders.\n"}
{"id": "4397369", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4397369", "title": "Skin whitening", "text": "Skin whitening\n\nSkin whitening is the use of substances, mixtures, or physical treatments to lighten skin color. Sometimes, the terms \"lightening\", \"brightening\", \"depigmentation\" and \"bleaching\" are also used. Skin whitening treatments work by reducing the skin's melanin content. Many agents have been shown to be effective in skin whitening. Some agents have beneficial side effect including: antioxidants, nutrients, or reducing the risk of some types of cancer. Other agents are a significant risk to health, such as mercury-based methods.\n\nSpecific zones of hyperpigmentation such as lentigo spots, moles, and birthmarks may be depigmented to match the surrounding skin. In cases of vitiligo unaffected skin may be lightened to achieve a more uniform appearance.\n\nMelanogenesis inhibitors have been discovered and developed via several methods. One way is through the screening of synthetic chemical libraries where high throughput screening is occasionally used. The second way is through screening of plant extracts by computational (in silico) search with off-label use of previously known drugs or exploration of structural analogues of previously known tyrosinase inhibitors. These inhibitors are based on knowledge (in varying degrees) of their structure-activity relationship. Thus, the development and discovery of melanogenesis inhibitors illustrates many of the methods used in drug design. Some of the most potent competitive reversible tyrosinase inhibitors are synthetic compounds with a potency hundreds of times that of kojic acid.\n\nMelanin is the main substance responsible for the color of the skin. Melanin is class of dark polymers generated by the body through the process of melanogenesis. Among the melanin pigmenting the skin and hair, two types can be distinguished based on its chemical composition and biological route of synthesis: the black/brown eumelanin and the red/yellow pheomelanin. The variation of skin color among individuals is mostly because of variation of the content of melanin in the skin. Skin with little or no melanin is almost white. Other factors influence skin color in a lesser degree, including the amount of blood in blood vessels (because of the color of blood), skin thickness and content of carotenoids in skin.\n\nMelanin in synthesized in melanosomes which are organelles produced in melanocytes. Melanocytes are cells dedicated to this function that are present in the skin, hair follicles, and other structures of the body. The synthesis of melanin (also called \"melanogenesis\" and \"melanization\") involves a chain of enzyme-catalyzed chemical reactions and non-enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The main precursor to melanin is -tyrosine. The first step of melanogenesis is the conversion of -tyrosine to -DOPA; this is the first and rate-limiting step and is catalyzed by the enzyme tyrosinase (TYR). Other enzymes involved in the synthesis include tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TRP1) and tyrosinase-related protein 2 (TRP2); TRP2 is also known as \"dopachrome tautomerase\" (DCT). -tyrosine is taken by the melanocytes from the intercellular medium, then transported to the melanosomes. -tyrosine is also synthesized within the melanocytes from -phenylalanine by the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH).\n\nMelanosomes are transferred to keratinocytes (the most abundant cell type in the skin). Most of the melanin of skin is found in keratinocytes. Additionally, melanocytes interact with keratinocytes through chemical signaling. See § Preventing the transfer of melanosomes to keratinocytes.\n\nSkin whitening agents work by reducing the presence of melanin in the skin. To accomplish this, there are several possible mechanism of actions:\n\nMany tyrosinase inhibitors have been discovered or developed. Many inhibitors of tyrosinase are known; most are of the reversible type. For a review of tyrosinase inhibitors see Chang (2009). Reviews of patents on tyrosinase inhibitors have been published.\n\nEvaluation of effectivity: The potency (how little of a substance is needed to achieve an effect) of \"reversible\" inhibitors is usually given in terms of its IC. The IC is highly dependent on the assay conditions, making it incomparable among different assays (unless designed to be comparable). It is customary practice in studies of tyrosinase inhibitors to assay one or several well known inhibitors as a positive control and point of comparison. The \"relative activity\" (RA) of a compound under investigation is its activity divided by the activity of the positive control; in turn the \"activity\" of a compound is usually defined as 1/IC. The RA is less dependent on assay conditions that the IC and is suitable to compare the results of different assays provided the same positive control was used. The positive control is commonly kojic acid.\n\nUpregulation of tyrosinase caused by tyrosinase inhibitors: Several skin whitening agents including some which are tyrosinase inhibitors have been found to cause an \"increase\" in the expression of tyrosinase (which by itself would increase melanin synthesis).\n\nIrreversible inhibitors of tyrosinase include: N-nonyl \"trans\"-caffeate, α-NaSiWCoO (a polyoxometalate), a structural analog of aloe emodin, structural analogues of barbituric acid, structural analogues of chalcone, sodium hydrogen sulfite, structural analogues of coumarin, structural analogues of the following 2 compounds: benzene-1,2-diamine and 2-aminophenol, and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid itself, tetrahydrofolic acid, analogues of pyrimidine and rhodanine, tetrahydropterines, cardol triene (a triene analogue of cardol extracted from cashew), \"N\"-(3,5-dihydroxybenzoyl)-6-hydroxytryptamine, aminoethylisothiourea, 8-hydroxynaringenin, NADH, 8-hydroxydaidzein and captopril.\n\nMicrophthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) is the master transcription factor that controls the expression of TYR, TRP1 and TRP2, MART1, PMEL17 and many other important proteins involved in the function of melanocytes. Downregulation of MITF decreases melanogenesis and is a mechanism of action of some skin whitening agents. As an heuristic rule, agents acting through downregulation of MITF are more likely to have side effects that selective tyrosinase inhibitors. Various signaling pathways and genetic mutations mutations influence the expression of MITF.\n\nInhibitors of melanogenesis whose mechanism of action includes reducing the genetic expression of melanogenic enzymes include caffeoylserotonin, AP736, pomegranate extract, and betulinic acid (extracted from Vitis amurensis root).\n\nThe melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) is a transmembrane and G-protein coupled receptor expressed in melanocytes. MC1R is an important target for the regulation of melanogenesis. Agonism (i.e.: activation) of MC1R increases the ratio of eumelanin to pheomelanin and increases the generation of melanin overall.\n\nMC1R/cAMP signaling pathway: Activation of MC1R causes activation of adenylyl cyclase (AC), which produces cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which activates protein kinase A (PKA), which activates (by protein phosphorylation) cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which upregulates MITF (CREB is a transcription factor of MITF). Whitening agents that interfere with the MC1R/cAMP signaling pathway have been reviewed by Chang (2012).\n\ncAMP is degraded by phosphodiesterases (PDE). The PDE5 inhibitors sildenafil and vardenafil, the cAMP-promoter IBMX and 8-CPT-cGMP (a cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) analogue) increase melanin synthesis.\n\nMC1R ligands: alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH), beta-melanocyte stimulating hormone (β-MSH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone are endogenous agonists of MC1R. Agouti signaling protein (ASIP) appears to be the only endogenous antagonist of MC1R. Synthetic MC1R agonists have been designed; examples include the peptides afamelanotide and melanotan II.\n\nMutations of the MC1R gene correlate, and in some individuals are at least partially responsible for red hair, white skin and an increased risk for skin cancer.\n\nMelanocytes express serotonin receptors and are capable of producing serotonin. Pharmacological interference with the serotonin system of melanocytes can result in either increased or decreased melanin synthesis. Serotonin itself is a weak inhibitor of tyrosinase with 0.11 times the potency of kojic acid. Nonetheless, serotonin increases synthesis of melanin when its \"overall effect\" on melanocytes (as opposed to \"isolated tyrosinase\") is evaluated. Activation of 5-HT receptors with BW-723C86 \"inhibits\" melanogenesis while activation of 5-HT receptors with the amphetamine structural analog DOI \"promotes\" melanogenesis. The serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) 6-nitroquipazine inhibits melanogenesis in-vitro.\n\nKeratinocytes in the skin: Within the skin, melanocytes are present in the basal layer of the epidermis; from these melanocytes originate dendrites that reach keratinocytes. Keratinocytes are the most abundant cell type in the epidermis. In the skin, there are approximately 36 keratinocytes per melanocyte. Keratinocytes are continuously generated in the basal layer of the epidermis and displace older keratinocytes of the skin towards the surface.\n\nMelanosome transfer: Melanosomes along with the melanin they contain is transferred from melanocytes to keratinocytes when keratinocytes are low in the epidermis. Keratinocytes carry the melanosomes with them as they move towards the surface. Keratinocytes contribute to skin pigmentation holding the melanin originated in melanocytes and induce melanogenesis through chemical signals directed at melanocytes. The transfer of melanosomes to keratinocytes is a necessary condition for the visible pigmentation of the skin. Blocking this transfer is a mechanism of action of some skin whitening agents. Skin whitening agents that block melanocyte transfer include niacinamide, heparin, madecassoside, soybean and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (a species of yeast).\n\nThe protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) is a transmembrane and G-protein coupled receptor expressed in keratinocytes and involved in melanocyte transfer. Antagonists of PAR2 inhibit the transfer of melanosomes and have a skin whitening affects while agonists of PAR2 have the opposite effect, as expected. The common endogenous agonists of PAR2 are serine proteases which irreversibly activate PAR2 by cleaving a part of the extracellular terminal of this receptor thereby exposing a part of it that subsequently works as a ligand tethered to the reset of the receptor at the molecular scale. Some synthetic agonists of PAR2 are short peptides that imitate the aforesaid tethered ligand but do not cleave the extracellular terminal.\n\nSeveral species of fungi produce enzymes that reduce pigmentation by degrading melanin. These enzymes often require the presence of hydrogen peroxide and sometimes the presence of Mg ions to work. They have been proposed as a safer alternative to hydrogen peroxide for cosmetic hair depigmentation.\n\nThe enzyme lignin peroxidase produced by the fungus phanerochaete chrysosporium has been studied as an ingredient suitable for skin-whitening: A double-blind placebo-controlled split-face randomized study found this enzyme to be effective and superior to hydroquinone in skin whitening. In a non-controlled study, this enzyme was applied to volunteers with facial melasma during 8 weeks; the treatment was found effective in reducing pigmentation in both skin affected by melasma and skin unaffected by melasma.\n\nSome compounds are known to destroy melanocytes; this mechanism of action is often used to remove the remaining pigmentation in cases of vitiligo.\n\nMost skin-lightening treatments, which can reduce or block some amount of melanin production, are aimed at inhibiting tyrosinase. Many treatments use a combination of topical lotions or gels containing melanin-inhibiting ingredients along with a sunscreen, and a prescription retinoid. Depending on how the skin responds to these treatments, exfoliants ‒either in the form of topical cosmetic or chemical peels‒ and lasers may be used. New development using LED systems are also showing good results.\n\nResearch has shown that the use of tretinoin (also known as all-trans retinoic acid) can only be somewhat effective in treating skin discolorations. Users of tretinoin have to avoid sunlight, as the skin can tan. Using tretinoin always makes the skin more sensitive to UVA and UVB rays.\n\nIn medical literature, hydroquinone is considered the primary topical ingredient for inhibiting melanin production. Its components have potent antioxidant abilities. Topical hydroquinone comes in 2% (available in cosmetics, often as monobenzone) to 4% (or more) concentrations (available from a physician or by prescription), alone or in combination with tretinoin 0.05% to 0.1%. Research has shown hydroquinone and tretinoin to prevent sun- or hormone-induced melasma.\n\nHydroquinone is a strong inhibitor of melanin production, meaning that it prevents dark skin from making the substance responsible for skin color. Hydroquinone does not bleach the skin but lightens it, and can only disrupt the synthesis and production of melanin hyperpigmentation. It has been banned in some European countries (e.g. France) because of fears of a cancer risk. However, other European countries (e.g. Spain) have both prescription and nonprescription formulations.\n\nSome concerns about hydroquinone's safety on skin have been expressed, but the research when it comes to topical application indicates negative reactions are minor or a result of using extremely high concentrations or from other skin-lightening agents such as glucocorticoids or mercury iodine. Any perceived risk is most likely applicable for African women. Hydroquinone has been shown to cause leukemia in mice and other animals. The European Union banned it from cosmetics in 2001, but it shows up in bootleg creams in the developing world. It is sold in the United States as an over-the-counter drug, but with a concentration of hydroquinone not exceeding 2 percent.\n\nBecause of hydroquinone's action on the skin, it can be an irritant, particularly in higher concentrations of 4% or greater and predictably when combined with tretinoin. Some medications have been created that combine 4% hydroquinone with tretinoin and a form of cortisone. The cortisone is included as an anti-inflammatory. The negative side effect of repeated application of cortisone is countered by the positive effect of the tretinoin so that it does not cause thinning of skin and damage to collagen.\n\nResorcinol or m-hydroquinone is often used in skin-lightener cosmetics in countries where free hydroquinone is prohibited.\n\nSome of alternative lighteners are derived from natural sources of hydroquinone. These include \"Mitracarpus scaber\" extract, \"Uva ursi\" (bearberry) extract, \"Morus bombycis\" (mulberry), \"Morus alba\" (white mulberry), and \"Broussonetia papyrifera\" (paper mulberry). All of these contain arbutin (technically known as hydroquinone-β--glucoside), which can inhibit melanin production. Pure forms of arbutin are considered more potent for affecting skin lightening.\n\nArbutin is derived from the leaves of bearberry, cranberry, mulberry or blueberry shrubs, and also is present in most types of pears. It can have melanin-inhibiting properties. Arbutin and other plant extracts are considered safe alternatives to commonly used depigmenting agents to make the skin fairer. Medical studies have shown the efficiency of arbutin for skin lightening. There are patents controlling its use for skin lightening. Arbutin actually exists in two isomers, alpha and beta. The alpha isomer offers higher stability over the beta isomer and is the preferred form for skin lightening indications.\n\nKojic acid is a by-product in the fermentation process of malting rice for use in the manufacturing of sake, the Japanese rice wine. Some research shows kojic acid to be effective for inhibiting melanin production. However, kojic acid is an unstable ingredient in cosmetic formulations. Upon exposure to air or sunlight it can turn brown and lose its efficacy. Many cosmetic companies use kojic dipalmitate as an alternative because it is more stable in formulations. However, there is no research showing kojic dipalmitate to be as effective as kojic acid, although it is a good antioxidant. Further, some controversial research has suggested that kojic acid may have carcinogenic properties in large doses. Other further studies show that kojic acid is not carcinogenic, but can cause allergic contact dermatitis and skin irritation.\n\nAzelaic acid is a component of grains, such as wheat, rye, and barley. It is applied topically in a cream formulation at a 10–20% concentration. Azelaic acid is used to treat acne, but there also is research showing it to be effective for skin discolorations. Other research also indicates azelaic acid may be an option for inhibiting melanin production.\n\nVitamin C and its various forms (ascorbic acid, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, etc.) are considered an effective antioxidant for the skin and help to lighten skin. One study found it raises glutathione levels in the body. Another study found that brownish guinea pigs given vitamin C, vitamin E and L-cysteine, simultaneously, led to lighter skin.\n\nGlutathione is a tripeptide molecule found in mammalian bodies. It is an antioxidant that plays an important role in preventing oxidative damage to the skin. In addition to its many recognized biological functions, glutathione has also been associated with skin lightening ability. While skin whitening reduces melanin which serves as the natural protection from UV exposure, glutathione's antioxidant property also protects the skin from UV radiation .\n\nA double-blind placebo-controlled study found glutathione to be effective as a skin whitening agent and in reducing dark spots; the dose regime was 500 mg per day (split in 2 equal doses per day) for 2–4 weeks. In contrast, a study that examined the effect of glutathione and related compounds in-vitro found that glutathione monoethyl ester but not glutathione had a depigmenting effect. A review of the use of glutathione for skin whitening was published in 2016.\n\nGlutathione is an ingredient in some cosmetics preparations. Glutathione for skin whitening is available in cream, soap, lotion, nasal spray and injectable form. Glutathione that is applied on the skin in the form of lotion is not efficiently absorbed by the skin cells as the thiol group undergoes rapid formation of disulfide. When taken orally, glutathione is hydrolyzed by enzymes in the gastrointestinal tract resulting in reduced bioavailability. The level of glutathione increased in smalls amounts temporarily when large oral doses were administered. As a result, the effectiveness of externally administered glutathione is slowed down by its inability to cross cell membranes efficiently and its rapid degradation by enzymes in the gastrointestinal tract. On the contrary, intravenous glutathione delivers very high doses directly into the systemic circulation and is the preferred mode of administering glutathione. However, this method of administrating the antioxidant might flood the cells with glutathione that may cause reductive stress. This might expose people to potential health risks associated with long-term use of high dose of glutathione. Of all the glutathione products, glutathione tablet remains the most effective type.\n\nGlutathione can be combined with many other agents like vitamin C to increase its absorption, N-acetyl cysteine to boost its level, and other antioxidants like vitamin E. Some oral intake of glutathione could have dangerous effect when combined with other skin whitening agents such as hydroquinone which is a carcinogenic element and monobenzone which causes irreversible depigmentation.\n\nAlpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) primarily in the form of lactic acid and glycolic acid are the most researched forms of AHAs because they have a molecular size that allows effective penetration into the top layers of skin. It is generally assumed that in and of themselves AHAs in concentrations of 4% to 15% are not effective for inhibiting melanin production and will not lighten skin discolorations in that manner. It is believed that their benefit is in helping cell turnover rates and removing unhealthy or abnormal layers of superficial skin cells (exfoliation) where hyperpigmented cells can accumulate. However, other research has shown that lactic and glycolic acids can indeed inhibit melanin production separate from their actions as an exfoliant on skin.\n\nAlpha hydroxy acid peels (using 50% concentrations or greater) may remove skin discolorations. Only a qualified physician should perform these types of facial peels.\n\nMost commonly, depigmentation of the skin is linked to people born with vitiligo, which produces differing areas of light and dark skin. These individuals, if they so decided to use a lightening process to even out their skin tone, could apply a topical cream containing the organic compound monobenzone to lessen the remaining pigment. Monobenzone may cause destruction of melanocytes and permanent depigmentation. An alternate method of lightening is to use the chemical mequinol over an extended period of time. Increasingly, people who are not afflicted with the vitiligo experiment with lower concentrations of monobenzone creams in the hope of lightening their skin tone evenly. However, monobenzone is not recommended for skin conditions other than vitiligo.\n\nMany skin whiteners contain toxic mercury, such as mercury(II) chloride or ammoniated mercury as the active ingredient. However, mercury has been banned in most countries for use in skin whitening (1976 in Europe, 1990 in the USA) because it accumulates on skin and it can have the opposite results in the long term. As late as January 2016, the FDA published a warning not to use a particular brand of whitener Viansilk's \"Crema Piel De Seda\" (\"Silky Skin Cream\"), sold in the United States due to its mercury content.\n\nTranexamic acid is sometimes used in skin whitening as a topical agent, injected into a lesion, and taken by mouth, both alone and as an adjunct to laser therapy; as of 2017 its safety seemed reasonable but its efficacy for this purpose was uncertain because there had been no large scale randomized controlled studies nor long term follow-up studies.\n\nOther options with some amount of research regarding their potential skin lightening abilities are licorice extract (specifically glabridin).\n\nThere is also a small amount of research showing oral supplements of pomegranate extract, ellagic acid, vitamin E, and ferulic acid can inhibit melanin production.\n\nBoth ablative and nonablative lasers can have a profound effect on melasma. However, the results are not always consistent, and problems have been reported (such as hypo- or hyperpigmentation). Laser treatments of this kind are more likely to result in problems for those with darker skin tones.\n\nAnother alternative to laser treatment is cryosurgery using liquid nitrogen. Controlled destruction of skin cells causes the skin to naturally regenerate itself. Excess melanin comes to the surface and peels off in a few days. This is particularly useful in sensitive areas like the genitals where laser treatment could leave a scar. Efficacy of the treatment depends on the depth of the pigment.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that some types of skin-whitening products use active ingredients, such as mercurous chloride and hydroquinone, which can be harmful. Hydroquinone is not available without a prescription in Europe. It is only available when prescribed by a medical doctor (e.g. a general practitioner). This is also the case in many other countries, where hydroquinone can only be prescribed by a doctor for certain skin conditions.\n\nA test of common skin lightening creams available in Nigeria showed that they caused mutations in bacteria and were possibly carcinogenic. A study that examined skin whitening creams in Mexico found a high concentration of mercury in several of them.\n\nIn India, the sales of skin lightening creams in 2012 totaled around 258 tons and in 2013 sales were about $300 million. As of 2013 the global market for skin lighteners was projected to reach US$19.8 billion by 2018 based on sales growth primarily in Africa, Indian-Asia, and the Middle East.\n\nIn the United Kingdom many skin whiteners are illegal due to possible adverse effects. Such products are frequently still sold even after shops have been prosecuted. Trading standards departments lack resources to deal with the problem effectively.\n\n\nItalics have been preserved whenever they appear in quotations.

They try hard to learn what school offers. They take pride not simply in earning the formal indicators of success (grades), but in understanding the material and incorporating or internalizing it in their lives.\" Since the U.S. college dropout rate for first-time-in college degree-seeking students is nearly 50% It is increasingly seen as an indicator of successful classroom instruction, and as a valued outcome of school reform. The phrase was identified in 1996 as \"the latest buzzword in education circles.\" Students are engaged when they are involved in their work, persist despite challenges and obstacles, and take visible delight in accomplishing their work. Student engagement also refers to a \"student's willingness, need, desire and compulsion to participate in, and be successful in, the learning process promoting higher level thinking for enduring understanding.\" Student engagement is also a usefully ambiguous term for the complexity of 'engagement' beyond the fragmented domains of cognition, behaviour, emotion or affect, and in doing so encompass the historically situated individual within their contextual variables (such as personal and familial circumstances) that at every moment influence how engaged an individual (or group) is in their learning.\n\nStudent engagement is frequently used to, \"depict students' willingness to participate in routine school activities, such as attending class, submitting required work, and following teachers' directions in class.\" However, the term is also increasingly used to describe meaningful student involvement throughout the learning environment, including students participating in curriculum design, classroom management and school building climate. It is also often used to refer as much to student involvement in extra-curricular activities in the campus life of a school/college/university which are thought to have educational benefits as it is to student focus on their curricular studies.\n\nIn a number of studies student engagement has been identified as a desirable trait in schools; however, there is little consensus among students and educators as to how to define it. Often, student engagement is defined according to one of the most popular measures of student engagement - the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE). Other studies have shown that student engagement overlaps with, but is not the same as, student motivation. Because of the lack of consensus on what student engagement is (and what it is not), researchers have begun to offer suggestions for moving the educational literature towards a unified conceptualization of student engagement. These researchers generally adopt a combination of psychological and socio-cultural perspectives to represent student engagement as three dimensions including affect, behavior, and cognition. Using these perspectives, some researchers have further borrowed from work psychology research to suggest that the 'engaged' part of student engagement means that student harness themselves to their role, and thus show a high level of activation or energy. In light of these recent studies, one definition of student engagement is that it is \"highly activated and pleasurable emotional, behavioural and cognitive involvement in academic activities\"\n\nStudent engagement is used to discuss students' attitudes towards school, while student \"dis\"engagement identifies withdrawing from school in any significant way.\n\nStudent engagement requires that teachers actively seek to create the conditions that foster this reaction. The first step to whole-school improvement in the area of student engagement is for the entire building faculty to share a definition of student engagement. Other steps include clear articulation of learning criteria with clear, immediate, and constructive feedback; show students the skills they need to be successful are within their grasp by clearly and systematically demonstrating these skills, and; demonstrate engagement in learning as a valuable aspect of their personalities.\n\nRelationships between students and adults in schools, and among students themselves, are a critical factor of student engagement. This is especially true among students considered to be at-risk and without other positive adult interaction. There are several strategies for developing these relationships, including acknowledging student voice, increasing intergenerational equity and sustaining youth-adult partnerships throughout the learning environment. There have been multiple formats identified for this type of engagement.\n\nThe National Survey of Student Engagement identifies dozens of everyday indicators of student engagement throughout colleges and universities.\n\nThe term \"student engagement\" has been used to depict students' willingness to participate in routine school activities, such as attending classes, submitting required work, and following teachers' directions in class. That includes participating in the activities offered as part of the school program and student participation in school reform activities.\n\n[Students] who are engaged show sustained behavioral involvement in learning activities accompanied by a positive emotional tone. They select tasks at the border of their competencies, initiate action when given the opportunity, and exert intense effort and concentration in the implementation of learning tasks; they show generally positive emotions during ongoing action, including enthusiasm, optimism, curiosity, and interest.\n\nAnother study identified five indicators for student engagement in college. They included the level of academic challenge, active and collaborative learning, student-faculty interaction, enriching education experiences and a supportive learning environment.\n\nIndicators of the absence of student engagement include unexcused absences from classes, cheating on tests, and damaging school property.\n\nThe opposite of engagement is disaffection. Disaffected [students] are passive, do not try hard, and give up easily in the face of challenges... [they can] be bored, depressed,\nanxious, or even angry about their presence in the classroom; they can be withdrawn\nfrom learning opportunities or even rebellious towards teachers and classmates.\n\nEngagement is more than what student listen & do. A high level of engagement results in better learning, and the learner will be emotionally connected, feel satisfied with the course & the institution. proposes a frame work in terms of Emotional, Behavioral & Cognitive. highlighted that the engagement is related with the Mastery of academic work. described the process of student engagement. The author stated that the student engagement stimulates the curiosity.;; identified four dimensions including academic, Affective, Behavioral, & Cognitive\n\nAssessing student engagement is seen as an essential step towards a school becoming a successful proponent. Critical educators have raised concerns that definitions and assessments of student engagement are often exclusive to the values represented by dominant groups within the learning environment where the analysis is conducted.\n\nThere are several methods to measure student engagement. They include self-reporting, such as surveys, questionnaires, checklists and rating scales. Technology, such as audience response systems, can be used to aid this process. Researchers also use direct observations, work sample analyses, and focused case studies.\n\nStudent athletes create one of the dominant groups in most learning environments in the United States of America. Most high schools and universities in the U.S. maintain a large student athlete population. Measuring how and why student athletes at colleges/universities engage with their surrounding academic and professional communities helps educational institutions better understand how they can help student athletes \"make the most of the rich academic environment.\"\n\nThe body of literature concerning college student athletes and how they spend their time has increased in recent years. Many educators and scholars have inquired whether participating in college athletics enhances or detracts from a student athlete’s college experience and whether participation in a sport negatively or positively affects other areas of a student-athlete’s college life. When analyzing the career of any college student or student athlete researchers often measure personal development to determine whether the student is happy and having a fulfilling college experience. For a student-athlete, personal development, a necessary ingredient to leading a successful life, includes participation in activities outside the sphere of one’s sport and interaction with non-athletes.\n\nMany scholars approach research concerning student athletes by comparing student athletes to non-athletes. In studies, such as those presented in the article, \"A Comparison of Athletes and Nonathletes at Highly Selective Colleges: Academic Performance and Personal Development\", which look at the behavior of students and student athletes, results have shown that student athletes perceive themselves as less intelligent, but more sociable than non-athletes. Surveys asking student athletes about their engagement with other groups on campus have found that the majority of student athletes engages in extracurricular activities and spends more than half of its time interacting with non-athletes. A trend in results developed as well; freshman student athletes proved to be more socially outgoing than senior student-athletes who admitted to spending more time with teammates.\n\nSome literature that attempts to explain student athlete involvement in extracurricular activities looks at factors such as the profile of the sport, the educational, social, economic and cultural background of athletes and characteristics of the institution, which may or may not support and foster student-athletes’ involvement in groups and clubs outside of their team. In determining levels of student engagement among college student athletes, methods of comparison between student athletes and non-athletes, females and males, NCAA divisions and revenue generating and non-revenue generating sports have proven helpful. Some researchers believe that differences in how non-athletes and student athletes perceive themselves may determine their level of involvement on college/university campuses. Research has shown that “high-commitment athletes were distinguished from non-athletes by their lower perception of themselves throughout college as smart, intellectual, and artistic/creative, and a higher perception of themselves as socially skilled, outgoing, confident and good leaders.” Despite the contrasts in where non-athletes and student athletes believe their strengths lie, “high-commitment athletes were as likely as non-athletes to report every year that they had grown as a person, pursued new activities and interests, gotten to know people from different backgrounds, and found a place at the college/university.”\n\nMany studies have shown that “on average, student athletes are as engaged in most educationally purposeful activities as their peers.” However, other comparisons have been made among student athletes in order to better understand which kind of student athlete pursues greater educational engagement. For example, when “compared with male non-athletes, male student athletes are as challenged academically, interact with faculty as frequently, and participate as often in active and collaborative learning activities,” however, “female student athletes\" when compared to female non-athletes \"are more likely to interact with faculty and participate in active and collaborative learning activities.” The size of the institution has also been studied as a possible factor in determining a student athlete’s engagement. Some researchers argue that “more selective, smaller schools with low student-faculty ratios have higher levels of engagement, as well as schools classified as baccalaureate institutions.”\n\nWithin the NCAA, colleges and universities are placed in one of three classifications: Division I, Division II and Division III. Research suggests that student athletes from each division differ in their behavior and levels of engagement. For instance, “for both men and women, students at Division III schools report higher levels of academic challenge...” and “interact with faculty more than students at Division I and Division II schools.” Such findings have caused some to conclude that student athletes at \"small residential liberal arts colleges (most of which are Division III schools)\" are more engaged than student athletes in Division I and Division II institutions. Variations in the levels of student-athlete engagement among institutions from different divisions may be explained by stated philosophies of each division. Institutions that compete at the Division III level “offer athletics because of its inherent educational value” and view athletics as an extension of the school’s “educational mission.” Member institutions of Division II broaden the focus of Division III members and place an equal amount of emphasis on academic, athletic and social success. According to the NCAA Division II Philosophy Statement, “the Division II approach provides growth opportunities through academic achievement, learning in high-level athletics competition and development of positive societal attitudes in service to community.” The stated philosophy of Division I institutions places less emphasis on the personal, social and intellectual growth of their student-athletes and states that its “ultimate goal is for student-athletes to graduate” because “a college degree gives student-athletes more options in life.”\n\nSeveral methods have been demonstrated to promote higher levels of student engagement. Instructors can enhance student engagement by encouraging students to become more active participants in their education through setting and achieving goals and by providing collaborative opportunities for educational research, planning, teaching, evaluation, and decision-making. Providing teachers with training on how to promote student autonomy was beneficial in enhancing student engagement by providing students with a more autonomous environment, rather than a controlling environment. Another method of promoting student engagement is through the use of learning communities, a technique that has a group of students taking the same classes together. By being part of a group taking the same classes, students show an increase in academic performance and collaborative skills. Increasing student engagement is especially important at the university level in increasing student persistence. It may also increase students’ mastery of challenging material.\n\nOne method that has been gaining popularity in University teaching is the creation or encouragement of learning communities (Zhao and Kuh 2004). Learning communities are widely recognized as an effective form of student engagement and consist of groups of students that form with the intention of increasing learning through shared experience. Lenning and Ebbers (1999) defined four different types of learning communities:\n1. Curricular communities which consist of students co-enrolled in multiple courses in the same field of study.\n2. Classroom learning communities that focus on group learning activities in the classroom.\n3. Residential learning communities that are formed off-campus that provide out of the classroom learning and discussion opportunities.\n4. Student-type learning communities that are created for special groups of students.\nWithin learning communities, students are able to interact with peers who share similar interests and stimulate conversation about the topic. Such conversations are beneficial because they expose the members of the community to new ideas and methods. Students that are a part of such communities are therefore able to generate and construct their knowledge and understanding through inquisitive conversations with peers, as opposed to being given information by the instructor. This type of engagement in the field leads to a deep understanding of the material and gives the student a personal connection to the topic (Zhao and Kuh 2004).\n\nOrganizing classrooms into learning communities allows instructors to constantly gather evidence of student learning to inform and improve their professional practice. They use common assessments and make results from those assessments easily accessible and openly shared among members of the team in order to build on individual and team strengths and to identify and address areas of concern. Results are then used to identify students who are experiencing difficulty and need additional time and support for learning as well as students who are highly proficient and require enrichment and extension. Learning community programs also improve students' interpersonal dialogue, collaboration, and experiential learning within the context of diversity, these programs address a decreasing sense of community and connection and allow students to relate their college-level learning to larger personal and global questions.\n\nThe connected learning educational approach is based on evidence that suggests that the most resilient, adaptive, and effective learning involves individual interest as well as social support to overcome adversity and provide recognition. According to research conducted by the Digital Media and Learning Research Hub, connected learning “advocates for broadened access to learning that is socially embedded, interest-driven, and oriented toward educational, economic, or political opportunity.” Connected learning environments are learning communities where the walls that separate student learning in and out of school are taken down, opportunities outside of traditional school organizational systems are created, and curricula and instruction is better aligned with student interests.\n\nConnected learning results when a pupil is able to pursue a passion or interest of theirs with the support of peers and caring adults and links their learning and interests to academic achievement, career success, and/or civic engagement. The critical components that encompass connected learning environments include: 1) greater depth and breadth of interests, 2) peer, adult, and institutional learning supports, and 3) greater academic orientation.\n\nThe connected learning approach calls for a central focus to include the linking of deep “vertical” expertise with horizontal expertise and creating connections to other cultural domains and practices, and also expects an outcome of the learning approach to be to deepen and expand each student’s areas of interests and expertise. A successful connected learning environment can deepen and expand each student’s interests, expertise, and knowledge by challenging them to learn and explore content outside of their “islands of expertise,” and emphasizing the importance of dialogue and connection practices.\n\nConnected learning environments allow students to be embedded in social networks and communities of different interests and expertise that they can call upon for help, feedback, and mentorship. Connected learning environments are characterized by their “low barriers to entry and a multiplicity of roles, ways of participating, and improving and gaining expertise.” The goal of connected learning is to integrate the peer culture, academics, and interests in the way that each individual student is best reached.\n\nStudent engagement represents two critical features of collegiate quality. The first is the amount of time and effort students put into their studies and other educationally purposeful activities. The second is how the institution deploys its resources and organizes the curriculum and other learning opportunities to get students to participate in activities that decades of research studies show are linked to student learning.\n\nThe J. Erik Jonsson Community School (3 year-old-5th grade) in Dallas, TX has a simple formula for success: \"Powerful Pedagogy + trusting relationships = student engagement\" (Journal of Staff Development, 2008). The majority of research is done is early education (Pre-School-5th), but this sentiment rings equally true in higher education. Accomplishing that end is nearly impossible in introductory, general education classes with class enrolments reaching up to 300 students at some schools but relationship-building is a skill that is under-appreciated in the \"college experience\".\nIn Australia many schools offer an integrated program developed by Hands On Learning Australia which provides a type of micro-climate for students experiencing disengagement to develop trusting relationships in the context of practical, construction based, tasks.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1441216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1441216", "title": "Sustained silent reading", "text": "Sustained silent reading\n\nSustained silent reading (SSR) is a form of school-based recreational reading, or free voluntary reading, where students read silently in a designated time period every day in school. An underlying assumption of SSR is that students learn to read by reading constantly. Successful models of SSR typically allow students to select their own books and require neither testing for comprehension nor book reports. Schools have implemented SSR under a variety of names, such as \"Drop Everything and Read (DEAR)\", \"Free Uninterrupted Reading (FUR)\", or \"Uninterrupted sustained silent reading (USSR)\".\n\nAccording to advocates such as Stephen Krashen, SSR has been shown to lead to gains in several literacy domains. Krashen looked at a large number of studies to see what conclusions were supported by empirical evidence.\n\nHe found that in respect to reading comprehension, SSR is successful; 51 of 54 studies found that students in an SSR program scored as well as, or better than, other students in this regard. It is most successful when used for longer periods of time.\n\nFurthermore, SSR was shown to create a reading habit. Several years after participating in a program, students reported more reading. One study found that a single SSR session was enough to change attitudes about reading. Long-term effects of SSR include better vocabularies, better writing skills, better spelling, and greater knowledge of literature, science, and \"practical knowledge.\"\n\nSeveral studies noted that children in poor neighborhoods had less access to books at home and in libraries, and often the books available to them were not books that they wanted to read. Prize-winning books were often not especially popular with children. Comic books, on the other hand, are often not available in libraries, but are popular with many boys, and reading comics was found to increase reading of other books.\n\nThree studies showed that providing rewards for reading did not improve reading development. Krashen believes this is because the presence of a reward suggests that an activity is work, and makes it less appealing.\n\nIn two studies, teachers noted fewer discipline problems when an SSR program was being used.\n\nAdvocates also point out that students in SSR programs have more positive attitudes toward reading than students who do not participate in SSR programs.\n\nThe National Reading Panel (NRP) in the United States meta-analyzed all quasi-experimental and experimental studies of SSR and challenged the claim that SSR has positive effects. The panel stated that the literature contained insufficient numbers of quasi-experimental or experimental studies on SSR to validate its use as a sound educational practice. The panel also noted that the absence of quantitative evidence was not evidence against the practice in itself. They recommended further study of SSR.\n\nJim Trelease is one of many reading advocates who has disputed the impartiality of these findings. He points out that the NRP included only 14 research tests in their summary, out of 54 studies he identified that might have been used. In 10 of the studies used by NRP, SSR students performed the same as other students, and in 4 studies, SSR students did better.\n\nHowever, some argue the NRP is not impartial at all. In fact, the NRP only included studies that were verifiable and with scientifically credible designs. The NRP had rigorous guidelines for the studies it would include. For example, the NRP did not include studies without control groups. The fact that the NRP only analyzed 14 SSR studies, shows that the other studies were not scientifically credible. \n\nIn the full group of 54 studies, SSR students performed better in 25, worse in 3, and the same in 24. SSR students scored worse only in short-term studies of less than 7 months. In studies that lasted one year or longer, SSR students did better in 8 of 10, and there was no difference in the other two. The NRP found that most of the SSR studies were not valid or verifiable. Many studies were simply correlational. Thus, only 14 studies actually followed guidelines that could make them statistically significant. Of these studies, SSR was found ineffective. \n\n\"Where do these negative SSR feelings come from?\" Trelease asks. \"Perhaps from the wonderful folks who make all those workbooks, textbooks, and score sheets that wouldn't be bought and used in class during the time students were lounging around reading books, magazines, and newspapers and getting so good at reading they might need even fewer of those sheets next year.\" There is some support for this charge: A blog titled \"Why Sustained Silent Reading (SSR) Doesn't Work\" is posted by the publisher of four workbooks that sell for $89.99 each.\n\nHowever, SSR was found ineffective by the NRP, not by publishing companies.\n\nA range of practices have been associated with SSR, and some advocates suggest that teacher models of reading behavior (i.e., teachers read while the students read), a long-term commitment to SSR, availability of multiple level, high-interest texts, and a sense of reading community are particularly relevant.\n\nFree voluntary reading (FVR) or recreation reading, related to the comprehension hypothesis, is an educational theory that says many student gains in reading can be encouraged by giving them time to read what they want without too many evaluative measures. Sustained silent reading is a method of implementing recreational and FVR theory.\n\n\n"}

Currently, there are 1000+ \"genes\" (i.e. attributes of art) in the project’s taxonomy, including art-historical movements, subject matter, and formal qualities. These genes are the product of Artsy’s team and their engagement with (and feedback from) the museums, galleries, curators, critics and art historians present on Artsy’s platform.\n\nThere are two general parts of the project: 1) Conceiving and defining such characteristics, referred to as \"genes,\" and 2) Applying these genes to artists and artworks—creating \"genomes\" for both—for the artsy.net site.\n\nImportantly, unlike tags, which are binary, genes are applied with values ranging from 0 to 100. The value indicates the degree of relevance of a gene to an artist or work of art. While not seen by users, such gene values account for the strength of a relationship between artists and artworks. It also enables similarity to be expressed in a more nuanced way< than it might be with just tags because one can weigh various attributes of an artist or work of art to establish which might be the most or less important. Furthermore, such nuance allows for matching potential collectors with artworks based on their tastes and preferences.\n\nArtsy’s \"genes\" create various opportunities for discovering and learning about the artist and artworks. If users search for an artist, they can see \"related\" artists and if they search for an artwork, they can see \"related\" artworks. Genes (with definitions) also appear on their own pages and provide the backbone for Artsy’s Browse page.\n\nThe Art Genome Project provides metadata for search (and similarity) results based on the principles of information retrieval (TF/IDF) and presents results in a UX-driven search product.\n\nMatthew Israel, an art historian, is the Director of The Art Genome Project.\n\nThe Art Genome Project has often been compared to Pandora's Music Genome Project, and was originally developed in consultation with Pandora’s Joe Kennedy. Both aim to create comprehensive (though by no means exhaustive) analyses of types of art by identifying a set of criteria, which both call \"genes\". These are both broadly applicable to their respective art forms, as well as useful for generating interesting connections for users. Importantly, while The Art Genome is currently one extensive list of genes for all works of art, Pandora has separate genomes (lists of genes) for each genre of music.\n\nThe Music Genome Project and TAGP are examples of Big Data, which is a sector of algorithmic technology that synthesizes data to predict what users will prefer. Artsy’s genome is user facing, allowing users to navigate genes manually. Netflix also makes customized recommendations to users based on the qualities of the movies that they enjoy. Amazon Art makes suggestions to users based on their browsing and purchasing history.\n\nMuseums and galleries as well as other online art image databases, such as Google Art Project and Artstor, digitize artworks for public access, but beyond providing basic metadata (artist, title, date, medium) these databases do not extensively classify works of art or create connections between them.\n\nArt historians, libraries and image archives have long used classification systems, art cataloging standards or metadata, and created taxonomies, such as The Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus to systematize the description of artworks. Classification is one of the major foundations of the discipline of art history.\n\nMost college and university art history surveys are based on such an idea of classification, to provide students with a way of grasping the history of art and a jumping-off point for more focused research. Unlike other types of classification, The Art Genome's taxonomy was designed for the purposes of establishing similarities between artists and artworks.\n\nIn the words of Matthew Israel, Director of The Art Genome Project, \"Genes are not tags — though we have many tags on the site — because tags are binary (something is either tagged \"dog\" or not). Genes, in contrast, can range from 0-100, thus capturing how strongly a gene applies to a specific artist or artwork. This nuanced connection between works of art is impossible with a simple tagging mechanism.\"\n\nImportantly, The Art Genome Project does incorporate over 6000 tags for content (iconography) in artwork as well as certain materials and mediums, which do not need the nuance of genes.\n\nDigtalmeetsculture.net calls TAGP \"user-friendly,\" \"intelligent and orchestrated behind the scenes by the Artsy experts.\" Complex.com highlighted genes in their article \"15 Awesome Genes on Artsy\" to show \"just how incredible their project is.\"\n\nIn the New York Times, the Cooper-Hewitt Museum’s director of new and emerging media Seb Chan said, \"sites like Art.sy were not meant to replace museums, galleries or books, but rather to help the public, especially art neophytes, stretch the boundaries of their taste. ‘You shouldn’t need to be a scholar to discover works of art that you might be fascinated by,’ he said. ‘You go to museums and you browse — chancing upon things is what it’s all about. The Art Genome is another way of creating serendipitous connections.’\"\n\nJonathan Olivares praised The Art Genome’s comprehensiveness, objectivity and ability to accommodate future revisions: \"Unlike books, which can only be modified between editions, the website is made of millions of layers of edits that can be reworked at any time… [and] [u]nlike the opinionated and subjectively ordered history book, this neutral and re-configurable database will allow us to access any work of art or design, within any imaginable order, and instantly.\"\n\nCriticism around The Art Genome Project centers on \"its classification system, which rubs some artists the wrong way.\"\n\nSome critics have questioned the accuracy of the connections made through genes: \"'I don't think what I am doing has anything to do with Cindy Sherman,' says British artist Jonathan Smith after being told the site links his work to hers via a staged-photography gene. 'That sounds like something a programmer would think of.\" Others have highlighted the subjective nature of genes and expressed a concern that they might be applied reductively.\n\n"}

Nunation does not exist in Tunisian Arabic, and short vowels are frequently omitted, especially if they would occur as the final element of an open syllable, which was probably encouraged by the Berber substratum.\n\nHowever, there are some more specific characteristics related to Tunisian Arabic like the phenomenon of metathesis.\n\nMetathesis is the shift of the position of the first vowel of the word. It occurs when the unconjugated verb or unsuffixed noun begins with CCVC, where C is an ungeminated consonant and V is a short vowel. When a suffix is added to this kind of noun or when the verb is conjugated, the first vowel changes of position and the verb or noun begins with CVCC.\n\nFor example:\n\nStress is not phonologically distinctive and is determined by the word's syllable structure.

The organization's mission states, \"WestEd, a research, development, and services agency, works with education and other communities to promote excellence, achieve equity, and improve learning for children, youth, and adults.\" \n\nIn 2013, WestEd's annual revenue was approximately $137 million, with over 530 clients and funders including the United States Department of Education, National Science Foundation, the United States Department of Justice, and many state, county, local, philanthropic, and business entities. WestEd has been vetted and approved as a qualified service provider in the following federal contracting programs: the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Program Support Center (PSC) Task Order Contracts, and the General Service Administration’s Mission Oriented Business Integrated Services (MOBIS) Schedule (SIN 874-1: Integrated Consulting Services).\n\nWestEd conducts various services -- consulting and technical assistance, evaluation, policy, professional development, and research and development -- aimed at supporting and improving education and human development. WestEd’s work is focused in several key areas: College & Career; Early Childhood Development & Learning; English Language Learners; Health, Safety, & Well-Being; Literacy; Schools, Districts, & State Education Systems; Science, Technology, Engineering, & Mathematics; Special Education; Standards, Assessment, & Accountability; and Teachers & Leaders.\n\nWestEd is a Joint Powers Agency, authorized by a California Joint Powers Agreement and governed by public entities in Arizona, California, Nevada, and Utah, with Board members representing agencies from these states and nationally, including leaders from public and private education, business, and human services communities. Its Board takes an active role in agency leadership and strategic planning. \n\nAgency leadership includes Glen Harvey, Chief Executive Officer; Sri Ananda, Chief Program Officer; Max McConkey, Chief Policy & Communications Officer; Catherine Walcott, Chief Development Officer; Richard Whitmore, Chief Administrative Officer; and Nancy Riddle, Chief Financial Officer.\n\nA nonprofit, public research and development agency, WestEd is tax exempt under Section 115(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, and, as such, meets the giving guidelines of philanthropic organizations.\n\nWestEd was formed in 1995 when the Southwest Regional Educational Laboratory (SWRL), located in Los Alamitos, California, merged with the Far West Laboratory for Educational Research and Development (FWL), located in San Francisco. SWRL and FWL were established in 1966, shortly after the passage of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) (Pub.L. 89-10, 79 Stat. 27, 20 U.S.C. ch.70), a United States federal statute enacted April 11, 1965. The Act funded several areas of primary and secondary education including professional development, instructional materials, resources to support educational programs, and parental involvement promotion. FWL and SWRL were established under ESEA (1965) Title IV, which established funding for educational research and training.\n\nWestEd operates several federal research and technical assistance centers.\n\nThe United States Department of Education Regional Educational Laboratory (REL) Program is a network of ten laboratories. \n\nWestEd was awarded the contract to operate the Regional Educational Laboratory (REL) West (serving Arizona, California, Nevada, and Utah) for the current period, running from January 2012 through the end of 2016. Under the current contract, REL West partners with regional educators to form research alliances dedicated to addressing regional needs and increasing the use of data and evidence in education decision-making. \n\nWestEd has operated REL West since the REL Program's inception in 1966. In the previous contract cycle (2006–2011), REL West published over 30 peer-reviewed studies and held 36 technical assistance events bridging research, policy, and practice, with well over 2,000 participants. During that period, REL West also delivered over 200 written responses to education questions from regional stakeholders and provided technical assistance to numerous state education agencies, state boards of education, legislators, local schools and districts, and professional associations.\n\nThe federal Comprehensive Centers Program is administered by the United States Department of Education, Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, School Support and Rural Programs. The Comprehensive Centers Program supports 22 comprehensive centers to help increase state capacity to assist districts and schools meet their student achievement goals. \n\nWestEd operates the California Comprehensive Center (CA CC).\n\nWestEd is also the prime contractor operating four other Comprehensive Centers: the West Comprehensive Center, which serves Arizona, Nevada, and Utah; the Mid-Atlantic Comprehensive Center, which serves Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and the District of Columbia; the Center on School Turnaround; and the Center on Standards and Assessment Implementation. \n\nWestEd is a subcontractor on six other regional Comprehensive Centers — performing program tasks for the Central Comprehensive Center, Northeast Comprehensive Center, and South Central Comprehensive Center, and performing evaluations for the Great Lakes Comprehensive Center, Midwest Comprehensive Center, and Pacific Regional Comprehensive Center.\n\nIn addition, WestEd is the prime contractor for the Northeast Regional Resource Center, which serves Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont. WestEd also conducts research for the Regional Educational Laboratory Northeast and Islands, administered by Education Development Center, Inc. and serving New England, New York, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands.\n\nWestEd is organized into several programs that provide research, technical assistance, and services in order to “create positive, innovative, and sustainable improvements in education and human development.” WestEd works with a range of clients at the state and local level, and is an approved service provider with several state departments of education, including the Arizona Department of Education, Colorado Department of Education, Hawaii Department of Education, Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, Tennessee Department of Education, and Washington Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction. Numerous school districts throughout the country have also selected WestEd as an approved service provider, including Baltimore City Public Schools, New York City Board of Education, Oakland Unified School District, Tucson Unified School District, and Vail School District. \n\nWestEd's Reading Apprenticeship program is a research-based instructional framework that is supposed to improve the teaching effectiveness of content-area middle and high school teachers, literacy coaches, and teacher educators. The approach helps adolescent students become more confident, engaged, and strategic readers. \n\nIn 2010, WestEd received a federal Investing in Innovation (i3) grant to address the persistent academic achievement gaps in the nation's high schools by scaling up the Reading Apprenticeship model of academic literacy instruction. This collaborative effort is providing research-based, discipline-focused professional development to 2,800 high school of biology, U.S. history, and English language arts; and is reaching more than 400,000 students in 300 schools. In 2013, WestEd received another i3 grant from the U.S. Department of Education to adapt a rigorously researched face-to-face Reading Apprenticeship professional development model into an alternative web-based model for high school science teachers: Internet-Based Reading Apprenticeship Improving Science Education (iRAISE). During the three-year grant period, 150 teachers and 33,000 students will be impacted by the iRAISE professional development. \n\nThe first Reading Apprenticeship study was conducted in 1996-1997 in one San Francisco public high school. Students gained an average of two years growth in seven months of instruction measured on a standardized reading comprehension test, while engaging in rigorous, academic work rather than remediation focused on basic skills. The program tenets and the results were published in the book, \"Reading for Understanding\" (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass), which recently had its second edition published. In 2005, A Randomized Controlled Study of the Efficacy of Reading Apprenticeship Professional Development for High School History and Science Teaching and Learning was funded by the Institute of Education Sciences, National Center for Education Research. Reading Apprenticeship is one of only two supplemental literacy programs selected by the Institute of Education Sciences for a rigorous evaluation, initiated in 2006.\n\nIn 2008, the Enhanced Reading Opportunities Study, also funded by the Institute for Education Sciences, reported that Reading Apprenticeship Academic Literacy had a positive and statistically significant impact on reading comprehension test scores (0.14 standard deviation; p-value = 0.015). The 2010 Final Report of the Enhanced Reading Opportunities Study indicated, “Overall, the findings from these reports show that over the course of ninth grade, the ERO programs [Reading Apprenticeship Academic Literacy and Xtreme Reading] improved students’ reading comprehension skills and helped them perform better academically in their high school course work.” \n\nThe Program for Infant/Toddler Care (PITC), developed collaboratively by WestEd and the California Department of Education Child Development Division, is a comprehensive training system used in multiple states that promotes responsive, caring relationships for infants and toddlers. Its centerpiece is a series of broadcast quality videos/DVDs in English, Spanish, and Chinese (Cantonese), with accompanying video magazines, guides, and trainer's manuals available in both English and Spanish. The materials are organized into four training modules, based on the latest research and practice. A complementary program, Beginning Together, ensures that children with special needs are incorporated, and appropriate inclusive practices are promoted, in the training and technical assistance provided by PITC. This is accomplished through \"training-of-trainers\" institutes, regional outreach activities, training materials, and demonstration programs. In addition, the California Map to Inclusive Child Care project provides a statewide system of support, information and resources for families and providers to facilitate barrier–free access to inclusive child care for children birth to 21.\n\nPITC worked with the Administration for Children, Youth, and Families to develop the Early Head Start program, and has presented training institutes and technical assistance for more than 500 programs serving families with children from birth to three. PITC staff have worked with representatives of 19 states, and over 7,500 trainers, college faculty, and program directors have attended PITC training modules since 1990. In 2002, the National Center for Children in Poverty selected PITC as a model initiative to support infants, toddlers, and their families. The Center for Child and Family Studies and the University of Cincinnati are codeveloping an online associate degree program for early Head Start teachers.\n\nMaking Sense of SCIENCE (formerly \"Understanding Science\") is a nationally field-tested professional development program that helps teachers learn major concepts of K-8 science, examine how children make sense of those concepts, and analyze and improve their science teaching. Making Sense of SCIENCE professional development modules help teachers actively learn science in combination with student thinking and teaching. Each module focuses on cases of actual classroom practice that illustrate students’ science ideas and highlight an important teaching dilemma, one that any teacher might face. Teachers engage in hands-on science activities that parallel those of students in the cases, examine student work, and critically analyze classic instructional activities and decisions. The principal investigators are Kirsten Daehler and Mayumi Shinohara.\n\nIn 2005, the Institute of Education Sciences, National Center for Education Research funded the development of three teacher professional development courses in the Making Sense of SCIENCE series that address challenging physical science and earth science topics: heat and energy, plate tectonics, and climate and weather. This development grant includes three small, randomized controlled studies to assess the potential efficacy of each of these courses separately to improve teacher content knowledge and student learning, and the reduction of the science achievement gap between English learners and English-proficient speakers. A fourth study will assess the potential efficacy of the entire sequence of courses on teacher knowledge and student science achievement. In 2009 the Institute of Education Sciences funded a randomized-cluster experimental design study, Impact of the Making Sense of SCIENCE Professional Development Model on Science Achievement of English Language Learner Students, to evaluate the effects of WestEd's Making Sense of SCIENCE model of professional development — an approach that emphasizes inquiry-based instruction practices that depend less on English proficiency, textbook knowledge, and direct instruction — on student achievement in science, especially English language learner students. The National Science Foundation has funded a large-scale study, Learning Science for Teaching: Effects of Content-Rich and Practice-Based Professional Development Models on Teacher Content Knowledge, Classroom Practice, and Student Learning, examining the effects of promising professional development models on teachers, classrooms, and students.\n\n"}
