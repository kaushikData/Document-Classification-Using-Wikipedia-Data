Other synonymous words used in the island of Siquijor in the Philippines include \"haplit\", \"paktol\" and \"anyaw\". \n\nMambabarang (noun) is a practitioner of this specific type of sorcery or witchcraft. Binarang (noun) is the target of the sorcery or witchcraft. Nabarang (adjective) means someone or something experiencing the effects of the curse or hex.\n\nThe Mambabarang is the Filipino version of a sorcerer/sorceress; the warlock/witch is a Mamalarang (e.g. Mamalarang Vonna Rizza Decano). The name is derived from the word \"barang\". Other synonymous terms include the Hiligaynon word \"manog hiwit\", which is also synonymous to \"kulam\". The verb barangon or \"hiwitan\" means \"to place a hex\"; a curse in Tagalog is a \"sumpa\". \n\nIn legends the \"mambabarang\" keeps his swarm of carnivorous beetles in a bottle or a section of bamboo, carefully feeding them ginger root. When the practitioner decides to employ his dark art, he performs a prayer ritual wherein he whispers instructions and identifies the victim to the beetles. The destructive insects are then set free and to seek out the victim and gain entry into the body via any bodily orifice: the nose, mouth, ears, anus or dermal breaks such as open sores/wounds. The victim will then feel the effects of the invasion of the insects through manifestations depending on the area of entry; hemorrhoids if through the anus, ear ache if through the ears and other similar cases. The resulting illness is supposedly resistant to conventional medical treatment and only reveals its true nature when the victim succumbs and flying insects issue forth from bodily cavities. In reality, it is possible a carnivorous beetle could lay eggs in someone it killed, and the eggs would then hatch post-mortem.\n\nSuperstitious folks still attribute certain illnesses or diseases to \"barang\". This most often happens in the provinces, where an herbal doctor, albularyo or a faith healer, a \"mananambal\" or \"sorhuana\" (female) / \"sorhuano\" (male) treats such diseases. In some rural provincial areas, people completely rely on the \"albularyo\" and \"mananambal\" for treatment.\n\n\n"}

Thus, they constitute one of the four main types of the most common typology of goods based on the criteria:\n\nOne modern example is climate stability. Classic examples of common goods are water and air. Water and air can be polluted: water flows can be tapped beyond sustainability, and air is often used in combustion, whether by motor vehicles, smokers, factories, wood fires. In the production process these resources and others are changed into finished products such as food, shoes, toys, furniture, cars, houses and televisions. Another example of a private exploitation treated as a renewable resource and commonly cited have been trees or timber at critical stages (used for wood and paper), oil (used for plastic, paints, foam, fabric, and often burned to create energy), mined metals (used to create machines, tools, nails, cans, coins), and crops (to become cotton and many kinds of foods). Fish stocks in international waters are also cited often. In this later example (avoiding any issues of the natural rights of the fish), while legal excluded from fishing may not apply, when fish are withdrawn from the water without any limits being imposed, living stocks of fish are likely to be depleted for any later fishermen. To describe situations in which economic users withdraw resources to secure short-term gains without regard for the long-term consequences, the term tragedy of the commons was coined. For example, forest exploitation leads to barren lands, and overfishing leads to a reduction of overall fish stocks, both of which eventually result in diminishing yields to be withdrawn periodically.\n\nDebates about sustainability can be both philosophical and scientific. However, wise use advocates consider common goods which are an exploitable form of a renewable resource, such as fish stocks, grazing land, etc., to be sustainable in the following two cases:\n"}
{"id": "14073564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14073564", "title": "Communication aesthetics", "text": "Communication aesthetics\n\nCommunication Aesthetics was devised by Mario Costa and Fred Forest at Mercato San Severino in Italy in 1983. It is a theory of aesthetics calling for artistic practise engaging with and working through the developments, evolutions and paradigms of late twentieth century communications technologies. Observing the emerging supremacy of networks over subjects, it called for an artistic approach that was both adapted to, and invested in this changing techno-social arena.\n\nAt the occasion of Artmedia, on Video Art organized by Mario Costa, Professor of Aesthetics at the University of Salerno, Fred Forest had been invited to enact a performance and installation involving the Italian National Television Broadcaster (RAI). The ensuing encounter revealed their mutual enthusiasm and interest in the evolution of the place of art in society given then developing communications technologies. Following an evening of intense discussion they wrote and signed a manifesto with Argentinian artist Horacio Zabala acting as witness. From the next day onwards, they established a list of artists whose practises reflected the artistic movement they had thus established. As a result, Roy Ascott, Antoni Muntadas, Stéphan Barron, Marc Denjean, Natan Karczmar, Jean-Claude Anglade, Mit Mitropoulos, Christian Sevette, Robert X Adrian, Jean-Marc Philippe, Wolfgang Ziemer Chrobatzek, Tom Klinkowstein, Eric Gidney, Ugo la Petria, Horacio Zabala, Daniel Dewaele and Piotr Kowalski expressed their alignment with the informal international group. Derrick de Kerckhove, director of the Marshall McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology at the University of Toronto, in direct communication with Fred Forest and Mario Costa, then set up a Canadian group titled “Strategic Arts” responding to the same concepts and objectives and in which Norman White was involved.\n\nCommunication Aesthetics is currently intact, though for geographical reasons it is today broken up into three distinct spheres of thought, action and intercession:\n\nIn an article first published in French in 1985 and available online in English, Fred Forest outlines the purpose of Communication Aesthetics:\n\n“Electrical, electronic and computer technology have now brought us firmly into communication society. This technology is at the heart of changes tha that have come about in social reorganization over a century, thus modifying not only our physical environment but also our mental system of representation. Electricity, electronics and computers today provide artists with new instruments of creation. The way our surroundings are being transformed in this direction a little more each day, together with our continually evolving adjustment with an ever-changing reality, is doubtless what is most important. This is why we must constantly reconsider our perceptions in order to apprehend the world in which we live.”\n\nIn short, Communication Aesthetics claims that a concomitant evolution in technologies of communication and strategies in art would have democratized (and thus demystified) the means of artistic production thus replacing the purpose of art as material production with the purpose of art as social interaction: “the artist now intervenes directly on reality, that is to say the carries out his symbolic and aesthetic activity using different means from those he has used up to now.” But Communication Aesthetics pushing this position further, by calling for an interactive intervention on reality, one that plays with the spectator in both meanings of the phrase.\n\nThis play is in turn a form of power play as it questions the labelling and limitations of figures of authority. The political ramifications of Communication Aesthetics are openly acknowledged by the founders, indeed they are called for: “In turn, the artist becomes a \" social operative \", he becomes a social performer. The scaling down and the provocation of power, and its recuperation as a form of play, belong to the field of art. The responsible artist knows this power as his, and confronts the surrounding world with it.”\n\nThe socio-political position-taking goes further still, as the artists call for the recognition of the formative as well as informative nature of technology, and particularly information technologies: “It must be admitted once and for all that the history and genesis of the configurations of the imaginary are indelibly engraved in the \"technologies\" upon which our perception is utterly dependent - and thus today engraved in the \"technologies\" of communication.” It is this analysis of the formal and functional aspects of communication that Communication Aesthetics calls for.\n\nCommunication Aesthetics pushes the psycho-physiological implications of technological innovations further still, elaborating on their concomitant modification of our concepts of Space and Time. Just as the auto mobile changed our approach and experience of home and locality, so too Communication Aesthetics posited that IT innovations would change our approach to human interaction. “The hooking-up of computers to each other, and also to other machines, is a fore-runner of the opening out of the telecommunications network and the abolition of certain constraints of distance.” And, once again, it is for the artist to understand and harness these modifications and constraints so as to engage with these evolutions in the name of communication: “We can but remark that all these transformations brought about by media systems are, without our knowing it, reorganising our whole system of aesthetic representation.”\n\nLastly, Communication Aesthetics engages with another more problematic implication of technological innovations, the increasing intangibility of perception and sensuality resulting from the rise of the virtual. Indeed, far from encouraging this lapse into asociality or asensuality, Communication Aesthetics seeks to frame these emerging problems rather than shy away from them. Once again, Communication Aesthetics seeks to lay claim to societal relevance and influence by allying communications innovations and artistic innovations on the levels both formally and functionally.\n\n\"The goal of Communication artists is certainly not to produce first level meanings, but above all to make us aware as to how, in the end, the generalised practice of Communication interreacts on the whole of our sensory system. This evolution is about to put into place the data for a \" new awareness \" at the edge of our perception, and then, along with new \" ways of feeling \", it will open up new aesthetic paths.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "50329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50329", "title": "Communication complexity", "text": "Communication complexity\n\nIn theoretical computer science, communication complexity studies the amount of communication required to solve a problem when the input to the problem is distributed among two or more parties. It was introduced by Andrew Yao in 1979,\nwho investigated the following problem involving two separated parties, traditionally called Alice and Bob. Alice receives an \"n\"-bit string \"x\" and Bob another \"n\"-bit string \"y\", and the goal is for one of them (say Bob) to compute a certain function \"f\"(\"x\",\"y\") with the least amount of communication between them. Of course they can always succeed by having Alice send her whole n-bit string to Bob, who then computes the function \"f\", but the idea here is to find clever ways of calculating \"f\" with fewer than \"n\" bits of communication. Note that in communication complexity, we are not concerned with the amount of computation performed by Alice or Bob, or the size of the memory used.\n\nThis abstract problem with two parties (called two-party communication complexity), and its general form with more than two parties, is relevant in many contexts: in VLSI circuit design, for example, one wants to minimize energy used by decreasing the amount of electric signals required between the different components during a distributed computation. The problem is also relevant in the study of data structures, and in the optimization of computer networks. For a survey of the field, see the textbook by .\n\nLet formula_1 where we assume in the typical case that formula_2 and formula_3. Alice draws an n-bit string formula_4 while Bob draws an n-bit string formula_5. By communicating to each other one bit at a time (adopting some \"communication protocol\"), Alice and Bob want to compute the value of formula_6 such that at least one party knows the value at the end of the communication. At this point the answer can be communicated back so that at the cost of one extra bit, both parties will know the answer. The worst case communication complexity of this communication problem of computing formula_7, denoted as formula_8, is then defined to be\n\nUsing the above definition, it is useful to think of the function as a matrix (called the \"input matrix\") where each row of the matrix corresponds to formula_4 and each column corresponds to formula_5. An entry in the input matrix is formula_12. Initially both Alice and Bob have a copy of the entire matrix A (assuming the function is known to both). Then, the problem of computing the function value can be rephrased as \"zeroing-in\" on the corresponding matrix entry. This problem can be solved if either Alice or Bob knows both and . At the start of communication, the number of choices for the value of the function on the inputs is the size of matrix, i.e. formula_13. Then, as and when each party communicates a bit to the other, the number of choices for the answer reduces as this eliminates a set of rows/columns resulting in a submatrix of A.\n\nMore formally, a set formula_14 is called a \"(combinatorial) rectangle\" if whenever formula_15 and formula_16 then formula_17. Equivalently, R can also be viewed as a submatrix of the input matrix A such that formula_18 where formula_19 and formula_20. Consider the case when bits are already exchanged between the parties. Now, for a particular formula_21, let us define a matrix\n\nThen, formula_23, and formula_24 is a rectangle and a submatrix of A.\n\nWe consider the case where Alice and Bob try to determine if they both have the same string. That is, we are trying to determine if is equal to . It is easy to prove that the equality problem (EQ) will always require you to communicate bits in the worst case if you want to be absolutely sure and are equal.\nConsider the simple case of and being 3 bits. The equality function in this case can be represented by the matrix below. The rows representing all the possibilities of , the columns those of .\n\nAs you can see, the function only evaluates to 1 when equals (i.e., on the diagonal). It is also fairly easy to see how communicating a single bit divides your possibilities in half. If you know that the first bit of is 1, you only need to consider half of the columns (where can equal 100, 101, 110, or 111).\n\nProof. Assume that formula_26. This means that there exists an formula_27 and an formula_28 having the same history, . Since this history defines a rectangle, formula_29 must also be 1. By definition formula_30 and we know that equality is only true for formula_31 when formula_32. Thus, we have a contradiction.\n\nIntuitively, for formula_33 less than , we need to be able to define a rectangle in the EQ matrix greater in size than a single cell. All of the cells in this rectangle must contain 1 for us to be able to generalize that this rectangle equals 1. It is not possible to form such a rectangle in the equality matrix.\n\nIn the above definition, we are concerned with the number of bits that must be \"deterministically\" transmitted between two parties. If both the parties are given access to a random number generator, can they determine the value of formula_7 with much less information exchanged? Yao, in his seminal paper\nanswers this question by defining randomized communication complexity.\n\nA randomized protocol formula_35 for a function formula_7 has two-sided error.\n\nA randomized protocol is a deterministic protocol that uses an extra random string in addition to its normal input. There are two models for this: a \"public string\" is a random string that is known by both parties beforehand, while a \"private string\" is generated by one party and must be communicated to the other party. A theorem presented below shows that any public string protocol can be simulated by a private string protocol that uses \"O(log n)\" additional bits compared to the original.\n\nNote that in the probability inequalities above, the outcome of the protocol is understood to depend \"only\" on the random string; both strings \"x\" and \"y\" remain fixed. In other words, if R(x,y) yields g(x,y,r) when using random string \"r\", then g(x,y,r) = f(x,y) for at least half of all choices for the string \"r\".\n\nThe randomized complexity is simply defined as the number of bits exchanged in such a protocol.\n\nNote that it is also possible to define a randomized protocol with one-sided error, and the complexity is defined similarly.\n\nReturning to the previous example of \"EQ\", if certainty is not required, Alice and Bob can check for equality using only messages. Consider the following protocol: Assume that Alice and Bob both have access to the same random string formula_39. Alice computes formula_40 and sends this bit (call it \"b\") to Bob. (The formula_41 is the dot product in GF(2).) Then Bob compares \"b\" to formula_42. If they are the same, then Bob accepts, saying \"x\" equals \"y\". Otherwise, he rejects.\n\nClearly, if formula_43, then formula_44, so formula_45. If \"x\" does not equal \"y\", it is still possible that formula_44, which would give Bob the wrong answer. How does this happen?\n\nIf \"x\" and \"y\" are not equal, they must differ in some locations:\n\nWhere and agree, formula_48 so those terms affect the dot products equally. We can safely ignore those terms and look only at where and differ. Furthermore, we can swap the bits formula_49 and formula_50 without changing whether or not the dot products are equal. This means we can swap bits so that contains only zeros and contains only ones:\n\nNote that formula_52 and formula_53. Now, the question becomes: for some random string formula_54, what is the probability that formula_55? Since each formula_56 is equally likely to be or , this probability is just formula_57. Thus, when does not equal ,\nformula_58. The algorithm can be repeated many times to increase its accuracy. This fits the requirements for a randomized communication algorithm.\n\nThis shows that \"if Alice and Bob share a random string of length n\", they can send one bit to each other to compute formula_59. In the next section, it is shown that Alice and Bob can exchange only bits that are as good as sharing a random string of length \"n\". Once that is shown, it follows that \"EQ\" can be computed in messages.\n\nIt is easier to create random protocols when both parties have access to the same random string (shared string protocol). It is still possible to use these protocols even when the two parties don't share a random string (private string protocol) with a small communication cost. Any shared string random protocol using any number of random string can be simulated by a private string protocol that uses an extra \"O(log n)\" bits.\n\nIntuitively, we can find some set of strings that has enough randomness in it to run the random protocol with only a small increase in error. This set can be shared beforehand, and instead of drawing a random string, Alice and Bob need only agree on which string to choose from the shared set. This set is small enough that the choice can be communicated efficiently. A formal proof follows.\n\nConsider some random protocol \"P\" with a maximum error rate of 0.1. Let formula_35 be formula_61 strings of length \"n\", numbered formula_62. Given such an formula_35, define a new protocol formula_64 which randomly picks some formula_65 and then runs \"P\" using formula_65 as the shared random string. It takes \"O\"(log 100\"n\") = \"O\"(log \"n\") bits to communicate the choice of formula_65.\n\nLet us define formula_68 and formula_69 to be the probabilities that formula_70 and formula_64 compute the correct value for the input formula_72.\n\nFor a fixed formula_72, we can use Hoeffding's inequality to get the following equation:\n\nThus when we don't have formula_72 fixed:\n\nThe last equality above holds because there are formula_13 different pairs formula_72. Since the probability does not equal 1, there is some formula_79 so that for all formula_72:\n\nSince formula_70 has at most 0.1 error probability, formula_83 can have at most 0.2 error probability.\n\nQuantum communication complexity tries to quantify the communication reduction possible by using quantum effects during a distributed computation.\n\nAt least three quantum generalizations of communication complexity have been proposed; for a survey see the suggested text by G. Brassard.\n\nThe first one is the qubit-communication model, where the parties can use quantum communication instead of classical communication, for example by exchanging photons through an optical fiber.\n\nIn a second model the communication is still performed with classical bits, but the parties are allowed to manipulate an unlimited supply of quantum entangled states as part of their protocols. By doing measurements on their entangled states, the parties can save on classical communication during a distributed computation.\n\nThe third model involves access to previously shared entanglement in addition to qubit communication, and is the least explored of the three quantum models.\n\nIn nondeterministic communication complexity, Alice and Bob have access to an oracle. After receiving the oracle's word, the parties communicate to deduce \"f(x,y)\". The nondeterministic communication complexity is then the maximum over all pairs \"(x,y)\" over the sum of number of bits exchanged and the coding length of the oracle word.\n\nViewed differently, this amounts to covering all 1-entries of the 0/1-matrix by combinatorial 1-rectangles (i.e., non-contiguous, non-convex submatrices, whose entries are all one (see Kushilevitz and Nisan or Dietzfelbinger et al.)). The nondeterministic communication complexity is the binary logarithm of the \"rectangle covering number\" of the matrix: the minimum number of combinatorial 1-rectangles required to cover all 1-entries of the matrix, without covering any 0-entries.\n\nNondeterministic communication complexity occurs as a means to obtaining lower bounds for deterministic communication complexity (see Dietzfelbinger et al.), but also in the theory of nonnegative matrices, where it gives a lower bound on the nonnegative rank of a nonnegative matrix.\n\nConsidering a 0/1 input matrix formula_84, the minimum number of bits exchanged to compute formula_7 deterministically in the worst case, formula_86, is known to be bounded from below by the logarithm of the rank of the matrix formula_87. The log rank conjecture proposes that the communication complexity, formula_86, is bounded from above by a constant power of the logarithm of the rank of formula_87. Since D(f) is bounded from above and below by polynomials of log rankformula_90, we can say D(f) is polynomially related to log rankformula_90. Since the rank of a matrix is polynomial time computable in the size of the matrix, such an upper bound would allow the matrix's communication complexity to be approximated in polynomial time. Note, however, that the size of the matrix itself is exponential in the size of the input.\n\nFor a randomized protocol, the number of bits exchanged in the worst case, R(f), is conjectured to be polynomially related to the following formula:\n\nSuch log rank conjectures are valuable because they reduce the question of a matrix's communication complexity to a question of linearly independent rows (columns) of the matrix. This reveals that the essence of the communication complexity problem, for example in the EQ case above, is figuring out where in the matrix the inputs are, in order to find out if they're equivalent.\n\nLower bounds in communication complexity can be used to prove lower bounds in decision tree complexity, VLSI circuits, data structures, streaming algorithms, space–time tradeoffs for Turing machines and more.\n\n"}

Many of the Cook Islands legends were recited through ancient songs and chants. The Cook Islands myths and legends have similarities to general Polynesian mythology, which developed over the centuries into its own unique character.\n\nIn Cook Islands creation myth, the universe was conceived of as being like the hollow of a vast coconut shell, the interior of this imaginary shell being Avaiki, the under world, and the outer side of the shell as the upper world of mortals. At various depths there are floors of different levels, or lands, which communicate with each other. At the very bottom of this coconut is a thick stem tapering to a point, which represents the beginning of all things. This point is the dwelling of a spirit without human form called Te aka ia Roe (The root of all existence). The entire fabric of the universe is constantly sustained by this primary being. Above this extreme point is Te tangaengae (Breathing) or Te vaerua (Life) this being is stout and stronger than the former one.

Her territory is very narrow, so much so that her knees touch her chin, no other position being possible. Varima te takere was very anxious for progeny. One day she plucked off part of her right side, like a fruit from a tree, and it became the first human being, the first man Avatea (or Vatea). He became the father of gods and men, having the right half of a man and the left half a fish, split down the middle. The land assigned by the Great Mother to Avatea was called Te paparairai (The thin land). Varima te takere continued to pluck from her body more pieces of flesh, from which more children were created, the right side of her body created gods, and from her left side of her body she created goddesses.\n\n\n\n"}

Initially, crickets were kept for their \"songs\" (stridulation). In the early 12th century the Chinese people began holding cricket fights. Throughout the Imperial era the Chinese also kept pet cicadas and grasshoppers, but crickets were the favorites in the Forbidden City and with the commoners alike. The art of selecting and breeding the finest fighting crickets was perfected during the Qing dynasty and remained a monopoly of the imperial court until the beginning of the 19th century.\n\nThe Imperial patronage promoted the art of making elaborate cricket containers and individual cricket homes. Traditional Chinese cricket homes come in three distinct shapes: wooden cages, ceramic jars, and gourds. Cages are used primarily for trapping and transportation. Gourds and ceramic jars are used as permanent cricket homes in winter and summer, respectively. They are treated with special mortar to enhance the apparent loudness and tone of a cricket's song. The imperial gardeners grew custom-shaped molded gourds tailored to each species of cricket. Their trade secrets were lost during the Chinese Civil War and the Cultural Revolution, but crickets remain a favorite pet of the Chinese to the present day. The Japanese pet cricket culture, which emerged at least a thousand years ago, has practically vanished during the 20th century.\n\nChinese cricket culture and cricket-related business is highly seasonal. Trapping crickets in the fields peaks in August and extends into September. The crickets soon end up at the markets of Shanghai and other major cities. Cricket fighting season extends until the end of autumn, overlapping with the Mid-Autumn Festival and the National Day. Chinese breeders are striving to make cricket fighting a year-round pastime, but the seasonal tradition prevails.\n\nModern Western sources recommend keeping pet crickets in transparent jars or small terrariums providing at least two inches of soil for burrowing and containing egg-crate shells or similar objects for shelter. A cricket's life span is short: Development from an egg to imago takes from one to two months. The imago then lives for around one month. Cricket hobbyists have to frequently replace aging insects with younger ones which are either specifically bred for cricket fighting or caught in the wild. This makes crickets less appealing as pets in Western countries. The speed of growth, coupled with the ease of breeding and raising larvae, makes industrial-grown crickets a preferred and inexpensive food source for pet birds, reptiles, and spiders.\n\nTrue crickets are insects of the \"Gryllidae\", a cosmopolitan family of around 100 genera comprising some 800 species, belonging to the order Orthoptera. Crickets, like other Orthoptera (grasshoppers and katydids), are capable of producing high-pitched sound by stridulation. Crickets differ from other Orthoptera in four aspects: Crickets possess three-segmented tarsi and long antennae; their tympanum is located at the base of the front tibia; and the females have long, slender ovipositors.\n\nThe life cycle of a cricket usually spans no more than three months. The larvae of the field cricket hatch from eggs in 7–8 days, while those of Acheta domesticus develop in 11–12 days. Development of the larvae in a controlled, warm () farm environment takes four to five weeks for all cultivated species. After the fourth or fifth larval instar the wingless larvae moult into the winged imago which lives for around one month. Crickets are omnivorous, opportunistic scavengers. They feed on decaying vegetable matter and fruit, and attack weaker insects or their larvae.\n\nA male cricket \"sings\" by raising his wing covers (tegmina) above the body and rubbing their bases against each other. The wing covers of a mature male cricket have protruding, irregularly shaped veins. The scraper of the left wing cover rubs against the file of the right wing, producing a high-pitched chirp. Crickets are much smaller than the sound wavelengths that they emit, which makes them inefficient transducers, but they overcome this disadvantage by using external natural resonators. Ground-dwelling field crickets use their funnel-shaped burrow entrances as acoustic horns; \"\" attach themselves to leaves which serve as soundboards and increase sound volume by 15 to 47 times. Chinese handlers increase the apparent loudness of their captive crickets by waxing the insects' tympanum with a mixture of cypress or lacebark pine tree sap and cinnabar. A legend says that this treatment was discovered in the day of the Qing Dynasty, when the Emperor's cricket, held in a cage suspended from a pine tree, was observed to develop an \"unusually beautiful voice\" after accidentally dipping its wings in tree sap.\n\nEntomologists from Ivan Regen onward have agreed that the principal purpose of a male cricket's \"song\" is to attract females for mating. Berthold Laufer and Frank Lutz recognized the fact but noted that it was not clear why males do it continuously throughout most of their adult lives, when actual mating doesn't take much time. More is known about the attractive mechanism of a cricket's song. Scientists exposed cricket females to synthesized \"cricket songs\", carefully varying different acoustic parameters, and measured the degree of females' response to different sounds. They found that although each species has its own optimal mating call, the repetition rate of chirp \"syllables\" was the single most important parameter. A male's singing skills do not guarantee him instant success: other, silent, males may be waiting nearby to intercept the females he attracts. Other males may be attracted by the song and rush to the singer just as females do. When another cricket confronts a singing male, the two insects determine each other's sex by touching their antennae. If it turns out that both crickets are male, the contact leads to a fight. Crickets, and Orthoptera in general, are model organisms for the study of male-male aggression, although females can also be aggressive. According to Judge and Bonanno, the shape and size of male crickets' heads are a direct result of selection through male-male fights.\n\nThe fact that only males sing, and only males fight, means that females have little value as pets apart from breeding. Chinese keepers feed young home-bred females to birds as soon as crickets display sexual dimorphism. There is one notable exception: males of \"Homoeogryllus japonicus\" (\"suzumushi\" or \"jin zhong\") sing only in the presence of females, so some females are spared to provide company to the males.\n\nThe singing cricket became a domestic pet in early antiquity. The ancestors of modern Chinese people possessed a unique attitude towards small creatures, which is preserved in present-day culture of \"flower, bird, fish, insect\". Other cultures studied and conquered big game: large animals, birds, and fishes. The Chinese, according to Laufer, were more interested in insects than in all other wildlife. Insects, rather than mammals or birds, became symbols of bravery (mantis) or resurrection (cicada), and became a precious economic asset (silkworm).\n\nBetween 500 and 200 B.C. the Chinese compiled \"Erya\", a universal encyclopedia which prominently featured insects. The \"Affairs of the period Tsin-Tao\" (742–756) mention that \"whenever the autumnal season arrives, the ladies of the palace catch crickets in small golden cages ... and during the night hearken to the voices of the insects. This custom was imitated by all the people.\" The oldest artifact identified as a cricket home was discovered in a tomb dated 960 A.D. The Field Museum of Natural History owned a 12th-century scroll painted by Su Han-Chen depicting children playing with crickets. By this time, as evidenced in the painting, the Chinese had already developed the art of making clay cricket homes, the skills of careful handling of the insects, and the practice of tickling to stimulate them. The first \"reliable\" accounts of cricket fights date back to the 12th century (Song dynasty) but there is also a theory tracing cricket fights to the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang (8th century).\n\nSinging and fighting crickets were the favorite pets of the Emperors of China. The noble pastime attracted the educated class, resulting in a wealth of medieval treatises on keeping crickets. The oldest one, \"The Book of Crickets\" (\"Tsu chi king\"), was written by Kia Se-Tao in the first half of the 13th century. It was followed by the Ming period books by Chou Li-Tsin and Liu Tong and early Qing period books by Fang Hu and Chen Hao-Tse. According to Yutaka Suga, cricket fighting was also popular among the commoners of Beijing and they, rather than the nobles, were \"the driving force behind the amusement\" during the Qing period. The court, in turn, forced the commoners to collect and pay their dues in fine fighting crickets, as was retold by Pu Songling in \"A Cricket Boy\" (early 18th century). In this story, which is set in the reign of the Xuande Emperor, an unfortunate peasant was given the impossible task of finding the strongest prize-fighting cricket. His cricket miraculously defeated all Emperor's insects; the ending reveals that the champion was mysteriously guided by the spirit of his own unconscious child.\n\nOne aspect of cricket-keeping, that of growing molded, custom-shaped gourds destined to become cricket homes, was an exclusive monopoly of the Forbidden City. The royal gardeners would place the ovary of an emerging \"Lagenaria\" fruit inside an earthen mould, forcing the fruit to take up the desired shape. The oldest surviving molded gourd, \"Hasshin Hyōko\" dated 1238, is preserved in Hōryū-ji temple in Japan. The art reached its peak in the 18th century, when the gardeners implemented reusable carved wood and disposable clay molds. The shapes of the gourds were tailored to different species of cricket: larger gourds for larger species, long-bottle gourds for the species known for long hops, and so on. Immature fruit easily reproduces the artwork carved into the mold, but also easily picks up any natural or man-made impurities. The finest craftsmen exploited, rather than concealed, these blemishes. Molded gourds were a symbol of the highest social standing. The ones held by Chinese royalty depicted in medieval portraits were actually prized cricket containers. The Yongzheng Emperor held a gourd in his hand even when he was sleeping, the Qianlong Emperor maintained a private molded gourd garden. In the 1800s the Jiaqing Emperor lifted the monopoly on molded gourds, but they remained expensive even for the upper classes.\n\nAt the end of the Imperial era Empress Dowager Cixi revitalized cricket fighting by staging contests between cricket breeders. A cricket of her successor, the infant Emperor Puyi, became a plot device in Bernardo Bertolucci's film \"The Last Emperor\" (1987). Bertolucci presented the cricket's container as a magic black box that opens up the memories of Puyi. According to Bruce Sklarew, the cricket, mysteriously emerging from the box, carries at least three meanings: it is the metaphor of Puyi himself, it is the metaphor of his wisdom acquired through suffering, and a symbol of the ultimate freedom that comes with death.\n\nThe ancient secrets of cricket handling and cricket-related crafts, only some of which were recorded on paper, were largely lost during the Chinese Civil War. From 1949 to 1976 the Communist regime suppressed cricket keeping, which was deemed an unacceptable distraction and a symbol of the past. Cricket trade was banned altogether in the 1950s, but continued secretly even on the People's Square of Shanghai. A dozen illegal markets emerged in the 1980s, and in 1987 the government formally allowed trading crickets on the Liuhe Road. By 1993 there were five legal markets, and in the 21st century Shanghai has over 20 cricket markets.\n\nThe short life span of a cricket necessitates frequent replacement of aging insects. The crickets sold in present-day China are usually caught in the wild in remote provinces. Earlier, most crickets sold in major cities were caught in the nearby countryside, but in the 21st century a local catch, or \"dichong\", is extremely rare. The majority of crickets sold in Shanghai in the 1990s and the 2000s came from rural Ningjin County in Shandong, where cricket hunting became a second job for local peasants. Practically all people of Ningjin—men and women of all ages—engage in the cricket business. A peasant usually makes around 70 yuan per night, and 2000 yuan per season. A very good season can bring a family over 10,000 yuan ($1,210).\n\nCricket catching extends over August and September. Crickets are most active between midnight and dawn. They are agile creatures, and when distressed they quickly hide into burrows or improvised shelter, or hop and even fly away. Typical Chinese crickets hide underground, so the catcher's first task is to either force or lure the insect out of its hideout. Trappers from the North of China use lighted candles to lure insects into their traps. Trappers from the South use iron cage-like lanterns or fire baskets to carry smoldering charcoal which forces insects to flee from the smoke. Other ways of forcing the insect out involve flooding their burrows or setting up juicy fruit baits. The Ningjin trappers use a simple tool, similar to an ice pick, for digging earth and poking under stones.\n\nThe trapper who has located a cricket must catch and contain the insect without causing it any injuries. Present-day trappers use \"zhao\", a soft catching net on a wire frame, to contain the cricket on the ground. The captured crickets are then placed into a clay pot and stay there until being sold; they are fed a few boiled rice grains per day. Earlier, the Chinese used cage-like traps made of bamboo or ivory rods. Pavel Piassetsky, who visited Beijing in the 1880s, described a different technique. The Beijing people used two kind of tools: a bell-like bowl with a hole in its bottom, and a tube several inches long. When a cricket was forced to leave its hideout, the trapper would quickly cover it with the bell. When the trapped cricket emerged from the hole, the trapper would present the tube, and the cricket would eagerly hide inside it. The plugged tube then became a convenient cricket cage.\n\nIn his 1927 book, Laufer described seven species of crickets kept by the people of Beijing; \"Oecanthus rufescens\" and \"Homeogryllys japonicus\" were the favorites based on their \"singing\" rather than fighting qualities. The most common species sold by Chinese traders in the 21st century are \"Anaxipha pallidula\", \"Homeoxipha lycoides\", \"Gryllus bimaculatus\". \"Velarifictorus micado\" from Shandong is especially prized. Ningjin peasants collect only the \"Velarifictorus\" species and discard the abundant \"Teleogryllus emma\" and \"Loxoblemmus doenitzii\", which are not used in cricket fighting. Peasants usually cannot even remotely estimate the probable market value of the catch. At best, they can sort crickets by size; their objective is to sell the catch to the wholesalers as soon as possible. They offload their catch at the local roadside markets (\"daji\") in the early morning, immediately after the night shift. They frequently overstate their selling skills: many crickets remain unsold and are discarded.\n\nThe trade is driven by urban consumers. As recently as 1991, from 300,000 to 400,000 people of Shanghai engaged in cricket fighting, with around 100,000 crickets fighting every day of the August–September season. Dealers from a large city normally control cricket haunts within of their base. The dealers and aficionados from Shanghai arrive in Ningjin in groups and lodge in the villages. Unlike the peasants, they are skilled in quick evaluation of the insects and have a stronger hand in bargaining. They have complex systems of ranking crickets in up to 140 grades (\"pinzhong\"). They quickly get what they came for and return to their home cities. The markets that normally sell bonsai and goldfish are suddenly overwhelmed with a mass of cricket buyers and sellers. Shanghai is a clear leader but the same activity takes place in all major cities. Local authorities encourage the trade and organize seasonal cricket fairs.\n\nCricket fighting is a seasonal sport, \"an autumn pastime\" (\"qiu xing\") that relies on the supply of wild-caught insects. Young crickets must mature before fighting; thus the high season begins near the autumn equinox. Crickets are placed in individual clay homes sprinkled with herbal medicines, bathed in licorice infusion every three to five days and fed according to each owner's secret recipes. The traditional diet of captive crickets, described by Laufer, consisted of seasonal green vegetables in the summer and masticated chestnuts and yellow beans in winter. The Southern Chinese also fed their crickets chopped fish, insects and honey. Fighting crickets were given a special treatment of rice, lotus seeds, and mosquitoes, and an undisclosed herbal stimulant.\n\nThe owners closely watch the cricket's behavior for signs of discomfort, and adjust the diet to bring the fighters into shape. The crickets are mated with females before the fight, as the Chinese believe that, unlike other beings, male crickets become more aggressive \"after\" having sex. In Laufer's time the fighters were sorted in three weight classes; present-day Shanghai aficionados have a system of nine classes from 0.51 to 0.74 grams. Both sides in a fight should belong to the same class, thus before the fight the crickets are weighed on high-precision scales (\"huang\"). The units of cricket weight, \"zun\" and \"dian\", are not used anywhere else.\n\nThe fights are held outdoors in an oval ring (\"douzha\"), which was traditionally a flat clay pot but is more commonly a plastic container today. Crickets are stimulated with a tickler (\"cao\") made of a rat's whisker hairs (Beijing style) or of fresh grass strands (Shanghai style). The handler tickles the cricket's head, then the abdomen, and finally the hind legs. Each fight consists of three or five bouts; the winner must score in two of three or three of five bouts. A bout is stopped when the triumphant winner extends his wings as a sign of victory, or when his opponent flees from the action. Laufer wrote that the fights of his time usually ended in the death of one of the crickets: The winners physically beheaded their opponents. Present-day fights may look vicious but are not lethal; the loser is always allowed to flee from the winner.\n\nA winning cricket progresses from fight to fight to the rank of \"the General\". Laufer wrote that the people of Whampoa buried their dead fighting champions in tiny silver coffins. According to a local tradition, a proper burial of a \"general\" ensures a good catch of wild crickets. Live champion fighters sell for hundreds, rarely thousands of U.S. dollars. The highest price for a single cricket was recorded in 1999 at 100,000 yuan ($12,000). The lowest price, of around 1 yuan, is for the mute and shy females that still have some value as consorts to the fighting males. The cheapest males sell for five yuan.\n\nBetting on cricket fights is outlawed throughout the PRC but widespread on the streets. In 2004 Shanghai police reported that it had raided 17,478 gambling places involving around 57,000 people. One such place specializing in cricket fights was located in an old factory building and had around 200 patrons, men in their forties and fifties, when the police arrived. Bets at this place started at 5,000 yuan ($600). According to an anonymous source of China Daily, secretive and elusive \"luxury games\" take place not in Shanghai but in the outlying provinces. Official attitudes about fighting vary from region to region: Hong Kong banned fights altogether; Hangzhou regulates it as a professional sport.\n\nMale crickets, whether held for fighting or for singing, always live in solitary individual homes or containers. Laufer in his 1927 book wrote that Chinese people sometimes hoarded hundreds of singing crickets, with dedicated cricket rooms filled with many rows of cricket homes. Such houses were filled with \"a deafening noise which a Chinese is able to stand for any length of time\". Present-day cricket containers take three different shapes: cages are used for trapping and transportation, ceramic jars or pots are used in the summer and autumn, and in the winter the surviving crickets are moved into gourds.\n\nWooden cages made of tiny rods and planks were once the most common type of insect house. The people of Shanghai and Hangzhou areas still use stool-shaped cages for keeping captive grasshoppers. Elsewhere, cages were historically used for keeping captive cicadas. They were suspended outdoors, at the eaves of the houses and from tree branches. Their use declined when the Chinese concentrated on keeping crickets. Small cages are still used for transporting crickets. Some are curved to follow the shape of a human body; crickets need warmth and prefer to be kept close to the body. The cage is placed in a \"tao\", a kind of protective silk bag, and is ideally carried in the pocket of a shirt. A special type of funnel-shaped wire mesh cage is used to temporarily contain the cricket while its main home is being cleaned.\n\nCeramic jars or pots with flat lids, introduced in the Ming period, are the preferred type of container for keeping the cricket in summer. Some jars are shaped as a gourd but most are cylindrical. Thick clay walls effectively shield the cricket from excessive heat. Ceramic pots are used for raising cricket larvae until the insect matures to the point when it can be safely transported in a cage or a gourd. The bottom of the jar is filled with a mortar made of clay, lime, and sand. It is levelled at a slant angle of about thirty degrees, smoothed, and dried into a shiny solid mass. In addition to shaping the cricket's habitat, it also defines the acoustic properties of a cricket house. Inside, the jar may contain a cricket \"bed\" or \"sleeping box\" (\"lingfan\") made of clay, wood, or ivory, and miniature porcelain \"dishes\".\n\nPet crickets spend winters in a different type of container made of a gourd (the hard-shelled fruit of \"Lagenaria vulgaris\"). The bottoms of the gourds are filled with lime mortar. The carved lids can be made of jade, coconut shell, sandalwood and ivory; the most common motif employs an ornament of gourd vines, flowers, and fruits. The thickness of the lid and the configuration of vents in it are tailored to enhance the tone of a cricket's song. The ancient art of growing molded gourds was lost during the Cultural Revolution, when the old pastime was deemed inappropriate for Red China. 20th-century cricket enthusiasts like Wang Shixiang had to carve their gourds themselves. Contemporary cricket gourds have carved, rather than naturally molded, surfaces. Molded gourds are being slowly re-introduced since the 1990s by enthusiasts like Zhang Cairi.\n\nThe two species most esteemed in Japan, according to Huber et al., are the \"Homoeogryllus japonicus\" (bell cricket, \"suzumushi\") and the \"Xenogryllus marmoratus\" (pine cricket, \"matsumushi\"). Lafcadio Hearn in his 1898 book named the third species, \"kirigirisu\" (\"Gampsocleis mikado\"). The Japanese identified and described the most musical cricket haunts centuries ago, long before they began keeping them at home. According to Hearn, the Japanese esteemed crickets far higher than the cicadas, which were considered \"vulgar chatterers\" and were never caged.\n\nThe first poetic description of \"matsumushi\" is credited to Ki no Tsurayuki (905 A.D.). Suzumushi is featured in an eponymous chapter of \"The Tale of Genji\" (1000–1008 A.D.) which, according to Hearn, is the oldest Japanese account of an insect hunt. Crickets and katydids (\"mushi\") were the staple symbols of autumn in haiku poetry. The Western culture, unlike its Japanese counterpart, regards crickets as symbols of \"summer\". American film producers routinely insert clips of cricket sounds to tell the audience that the action takes place in summer.\n\nCricket trade emerged as a full-time occupation in the 17th century. The poet Takarai Kikaku complained that he could not find any \"mushiya\" (cricket dealers) in the city of Edo; according to Hearn this meant that he \"expected\" to find such dealers there. Tokyo lagged behind other cities; regular trade there emerged only at the end of the 18th century. A food vendor named Chuzo, who collected crickets for fun, suddenly discovered considerable demand for them among his neighbors and started trading in wild crickets. One of his customers, Kiriyama, succeeded in breeding three species of crickets. He partnered with Chuzo in the business, which was \"profitable beyond expectations\". Chuzo was flooded with orders and switched exclusively to wholesale operations, supplying crickets to street dealers and collecting royalties from cage makers. During the Bunsei period the government contained competition between cricket dealers by limiting them to thirty-six, in a guild known as Ōyama-Ko (after Mount Ōyama) or, alternatively, the Yedo Insect Company. At the end of the 19th century cricket trade was dominated by two houses: Kawasumo Kanesaburo and his network supplied wild-caught insects, and the Yumoto house specialized in breeding crickets off-season. They dealt in twelve species of wild-caught and nine species of artificially-bred crickets.\n\nThis tradition, which peaked in the 19th century, is now largely gone but crickets are still sold at pet shops. A large colony of suzumushi crickets thrives at the altar of the Suzumushi Temple in Kyoto. These crickets have no particular religious significance; they are retained as a tourist attraction.\n\nEuropean naturalists studied crickets since the 18th century. William Gould described feeding ant nymphs to a captive mole cricket for several months. The European approach to cricket breeding has been popularized by Jean-Henri Fabre. Fabre wrote that breeding \"demands no particular preparations. A little patience is enough.\" According to Fabre, home breeding may start as early as April or May with the capture of a couple of field crickets. They are placed in a flower pot with \"a layer of beaten earth\" inside, and a tightly fitting lid. Fed only with lettuce, Fabre's cricket couple laid five to six hundred eggs, and practically all of them hatched.\n\nCrickets are a common subject of children's books on nature and advice on keeping pet crickets are plentiful. An ideal home habitat for a cricket is a large transparent jar or a small terrarium with at least two inches of damp soil on the bottom. There must be plenty of shelter where the crickets can hide; children's books and industrial breeders recommend egg-crate shells. The top of the terrarium must be tightly covered with a lid or nylon mesh.\n\nDrinking water is supplied by offering crickets a wet sponge or spraying their container, but never directly: crickets easily drown even in small dishes of water. Crickets feed on all kinds of fresh fruit and greens; industrial breeders also feed bulk quantities of dry fish food – \"Daphnia\" and \"Gammarus\". Contrary to the Eastern approach of keeping males in solitary cells, keeping males together is acceptable: According to Amato, protein-rich diet reduces the males' drive to fight.\n\nChinese breeders of the 21st century strive to extend the fighting season to the whole year. They advertise farm-bred \"designer bugs\" as super-fighters and agree that their technology is \"completely counter to the natural process\". However, they refuse to use hormones or the practice of arming crickets with steel implants. As of 2003, these farm-bred crickets retailed for only around $1.50 a head, ten times lower than average wild-caught Shandong cricket. Breeding is a risky business: Chinese cricket farms are regularly wiped out by an unknown disease. Fungal diseases are manageable, but crickets have no defenses against cricket paralysis virus (CrPV), which almost certainly kills the entire population. The virus was first isolated in Australia around 1970. The worst outbreak in Europe occurred in 2002. The cosmopolitan virus is carried by a multitude of invertebrate hosts, including drosophilae and honey bees, which are not affected by the disease.\n\nAlmost all crickets farmed in the United States are \"Acheta domesticus\". The American cricket industry does not disclose its earnings; in 1989 Huber et al. estimated it at $3,000,000 annually. Most of these crickets were not pets, but fish bait and animal food. The largest shipment, of 445 metric tons, was reported by Purina Mills in 1985. A decade later individual cricket farms like the Bassett Cricket Ranch in Visalia, California easily surpassed the million-dollar mark. By 1998 Bassett shipped two million crickets a week. The Fluker Cricket Farm in Louisiana exceeded $5,000,000 in annual sales in 2001 and became a staple subject of American business school textbooks.\n\nThe zoos of the Old World breed \"Acheta domesticus\", \"Gryllus bimaculatus\", and \"Gryllus assimilis\". Their cricket farms usually rotate four generation (\"four crates\") of insects. One generation or one physical crate is used for mating and incubation of eggs, which takes from seven to twelve days. One male usually mates to three or four females. Females are discarded (and fed to zoo animals) immediately after laying the eggs: their life span is too short to give them a second chance. Three other generations, spaced by the same seven to twelve days, are for raising the larvae, which takes 4–5 weeks. Thus the zoos restock their live food supply practically every week.\n\nBritish zoos breed crickets in deliberate attempts to restore the nearly extinct wild populations. In the late 1980s the British population of \"Gryllus campestris\" shrunk to a single colony of around 100 individual insects. In 1991 the species became the subject of the national Species Recovery Program. Each year, three pairs of subadult crickets were caught in the wild and bred in a controlled lab environment to preserve the gene pool of the mother colony. The London Zoo raised 17,000 crickets; the field biologists laid down seven new cricket colonies, four of which survived into the 21st century. The program became a model for similar efforts in other countries. In the same period the London Zoo bred the more demanding wart-biter (\"Decticus verrucivorus\"), also resulting in the establishment of persistent colonies in the wild.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "45218019", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45218019", "title": "Cultural-historical activity theory", "text": "Cultural-historical activity theory\n\nCultural-historical activity theory (CHAT) is a theoretical framework which helps to understand and analyse the relationship between the human mind (what people think and feel) and activity (what people do). It traces its origins to the founders of the cultural-historical school of Russian psychology L. S. Vygotsky and Aleksei N. Leontiev. Vygotsky's important insight into the dynamics of consciousness was that it is essentially subjective and shaped by the history of each individual's social and cultural experience. Especially since the 1990s, CHAT has attracted a growing interest among academics worldwide. Elsewhere CHAT has been defined as \"a cross-disciplinary framework for studying how humans purposefully transform natural and social reality, including themselves, as an ongoing culturally and historically situated, materially and socially mediated process\". Core ideas are: 1) humans act collectively, learn by doing, and communicate in and via their actions; 2) humans make, employ, and adapt tools of all kinds to learn and communicate; and 3) community is central to the process of making and interpreting meaning – and thus to all forms of learning, communicating, and acting.\n\nThe term CHAT was coined by Michael Cole and popularized by Yrjö Engeström to promote the unity of what, by the 1990s, had become a variety of currents harking back to Vygotsky's work.\n\nCHAT traces its lineage to dialectical materialism, classical German philosophy, and the work of Lev Vygotsky, Aleksei N. Leontiev and Aleksandr Luria, known as \"the founding troika\" of the cultural-historical approach to Social Psychology. In a radical departure from the behaviorism and reflexology that dominated much of psychology in the early 1920s, they formulated, in the spirit of Karl Marx's Theses on Feuerbach, the concept of activity, i.e., \"artifact-mediated and object-oriented action\". By bringing together the notion of history and culture in the understanding of human activity, they were able to transcend the Cartesian dualism between subject and object, internal and external, between people and society, between individual inner consciousness and the outer world of society. Lev Vygotsky, who created the foundation of cultural-historical psychology, based on the concept of mediation, published six books on psychology topics during a working life which spanned only ten years. He died of TB in 1934 at the age of 37. A.N. Leont'ev worked with Lev Vygotsky and Alexandr Luria from 1924 to 1930, collaborating on the development of a Marxist psychology. Leontiev left Vygotsky's group in Moscow in 1931, to take up a position in Kharkov. There he was joined by local psychologists, including Pyotr Galperin and Pyotr Zinchenko. He continued to work with Vygotsky for some time but, eventually, there was a split, although they continued to communicate with one another on scientific matters. Leontiev returned to Moscow in 1934. Contrary to popular belief, Vygotsky's work per se was never banned in Stalinist Soviet Russia. In 1950 A.N.Leontiev became the Head of the Psychology Department at the Faculty of Philosophy of the Lomonosov Moscow State University (MGU). This department became an independent Faculty in 1966 due mainly to his hard work. He remained there until his death in 1979. Leontiev's formulation of activity theory, post 1962, had become the new \"official\" basis for Soviet psychology. In the two decades between a thaw in the suppression of scientific enquiry in Russia and the death of the Vygotsky's continuers, contact was made with the West.\n\nMichael Cole, then a young Indiana University psychology post-graduate exchange student, arrived in Moscow in 1962 for a one-year stint of research under Alexandr Luria. Keenly aware of the gulf between Soviet and American psychology, he was one for the first Westerners to present Luria's and Vygotsky's idea to an Anglo-Saxon public. This, and a steady flow of books translated from the Russian ensured the gradual establishment of a solid Cultural Psychology base in the west. Another American scholar, James V. Wertsch, after completing his PhD at the University of Chicago in 1975, spent a year as a postdoctoral fellow in Moscow to study linguistics and neuropsychology. Wertsch subsequently became one of the leading Western experts on Soviet Psychology. Principal among the groups promoting CHAT-related research is Yjrö Engeström's Helsinki-based CRADLE. In 1982 an Activity Conference, claimed to have been the first of its kind in Europe, organized by Yrjö Engeström to concentrate on teaching and learning issues, took place in Espoo (Fl), with the participation of experts from both Eastern and Western European countries. This was followed by the Aarhus (Dk) Conference in 1983 and the Utrecht (Nl) conference in 1984. In October 1986, West Berlin's College of Arts hosted the first ISCAR International Congress on Activity Theory. This was also the first effort to bring together under one roof researchers, theorists and philosophers working in the tradition of the Soviet psychologists Leontiev and Vygotsky. The second ISCRAT congress took place in Lahti, (Fl) in 1990. ISCRAT became a formal legal organization with its own by-laws in Amsterdam, 1992. Other ISCRAT conferences: Rome (1993), Moscow (1995), Aarhus (1998) and Amsterdam (2002), when ISCRAT and the Conference for Socio Cultural Research merged into ISCAR. From here on, ISCAR organizes an international Congress every three years: Sevilla (Es) 2005; San Diego (USA) 2008; Rome (It) 2011; Sydney (Au) 2014; Quebec, Canada (2017).\n\nIn more recent years the implications of activity theory in organizational development have been promoted by the work Yrjö Engeström's team at the Centre for Activity Theory and Developmental Work Research (CATDWR) at the University of Helsinki, and Mike Cole at the Laboratory of Comparative Human Cognition (LCHC) at the University of California San Diego campus.\n\nIn his 1987 \"Learning by expanding\", Engeström offers a very detailed account of the diverse sources, philosophical and psychological, that inform activity theory. In subsequent years, however, a simplified picture has emerged from his and other researchers' work, namely the idea that (to date) there are three principal 'stages' or 'generations' of activity theory, or \"cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT). Whilst the first generation built on Vygotsky's notion of mediated action, from the individual's perspective, and the second generation built on Leont'ev's notion of activity system, with emphasis on the collective, the third generation, which appeared in the mid-nineties, builds on the idea of multiple interacting activity systems focused on a partially shared object, and boundary-crossings between them.\n\nThe first generation emerges from Vygotsky's theory of cultural mediation, which was a response to behaviorism's explanation of consciousness, or the development of the human mind, by reducing \"mind\" to a series of atomic components or structures associated primarily with the brain as \"stimulus – response\" (S-R) processes. Vygotsky argued that the relationship between a human subject and an object is never direct but must be sought in society and culture as they evolve historically, rather than in the human brain or individual mind unto itself. His cultural-historical psychology attempted to account for the social origins of language and thinking. To Vygotsky, consciousness emerges from human activity mediated by artifacts (tools) and signs. This idea of semiotic mediation is embodied in Vygotsky's famous triangular model which features the Subject (S), Object (O), and Mediating Artifact triad: in mediated action the Subject, Object, and Artifact stand in a dialectical relationship whereby each affects the other and the activity as a whole. Vygotsky argues that the use of signs leads to a specific structure of human behavior, which breaks away from mere biological development allowing the creation of new forms of culturally-based psychological processes – hence the importance of (cultural-historical) context: individuals could no longer be understood without their cultural environment, nor society without the \"agency\" of the individuals who use and produced these artifacts. The objects became cultural entities, and action oriented towards the objects became the key to understanding the human psyche. In the Vygotskyan framework the unit of analysis, however, remains principally the individual. First-generation activity theory has been used to understand individual behavior by examining the ways in which a person's objectivized actions are culturally \"mediated\". Besides a strong focus on material and symbolic mediation, internalization of external (social, societal, and cultural) forms of mediation, another important, aspect of first generation CHAT is the concept of the zone of proximal development (ZPD), meaning, as advanced in \"Mind in Society\" (1978), \"the distance between the actual developmental level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers\". ZDP is one of the major legacies of Vygotsky's work in the social sciences.\n\nWhile Vygotsky formulated practical human activity as the general explanatory category in human psychology, he did not fully clarify its precise nature. The second generation moves, beyond Vygotsky's individually-focused to A.N. Leontiev's collective model. In Engeström's now famous graphic depiction of second-generation activity, the unit of analysis has been expanded to include collective motivated activity toward an object, making room for understanding how collective action by social groups mediates activity. Hence the inclusion of \"community\", \"rules\", \"division of labor\" and the importance of analyzing their interactions with each other. Rules may be explicit or implicit. Division of labor refers to the explicit and implicit organization of the community involved in the activity. Engeström articulated the clearest distinction between classic Vygotskian psychology, which emphasizes the way semiotic and cultural systems mediate human \"action\", and Leontiev's second-generation CHAT, which is focused on the meditational effects of the systemic organization of human \"activity\". In insisting that activity only exists in relation to rules, community and division of labor, Engeström expands \"the unit of analysis\" for studying human behavior from that of individual activity to a collective \"activity system\". The collective \"activity system\" includes the social, psychological, cultural and institutional perspectives in the analysis. In this conceptualization context or activity systems are inherently related to what Engeström argues are the deep-seated material practices and socioeconomic structures of a given culture. These societal dimensions had not been taken sufficiently into account by Vygotsky's, earlier, more 'simple' triadic model: in Leontiev's understanding, thought and cognition should be understood as a part of social life – as a part of the means of production and systems of social relations on one hand, and the intentions of individuals in certain social conditions on the other.\n\nIn his famous example of the 'primeval collective hunt', Leontiev clarifies the crucial difference between an individual \"action\" (\"the beater frightening game\") and a collective \"activity\" (\"the hunt\"). While individuals' actions (frightening game) are different from the overall \"goal\" of the activity (hunt), they all share in the same \"motive\" (obtaining food). \"Operations\", on the other hand, are driven by the conditions and tools at hand, i.e. the objective circumstances under which the hunt is taking place. To understand the separate actions of the individuals, one needs to understand the broader \"motive\" behind the activity as a whole: this accounts for the three hierarchical levels of human functioning: \"object\"-related motives drive the collective activity (top); \"goals\" drive individual/group action(s) (middle); \"conditions\" and \"tools\" drive automated operations (lower level).\n\nAfter Vygotsky's foundational work on the individual's higher psychological functions and Leontiev's extension of these insights to collective activity systems, questions of diversity and dialogue between different traditions or perspectives became increasingly serious challenges, when, especially in the post-1990s, activity theory 'went international'. The work of Michael Cole and Yrjö Engeström in the 1970s and 1980s – mostly in parallel, but occasionally in collaboration – brought activity theory to a much wider audience of scholars in Scandinavia and North America. Once the lives and biographies of all the participants and the history of the wider community are taken into account, \"multiple activity systems\" need to be considered, positing, according to Engeström, the need for a \"third generation\" to \"\"develop conceptual tools to understand dialogue, multiple perspectives, and networks of interacting activity Systems\". This larger canvas of active individuals (and researchers) embedded in organizational, political, and discursive practices constitutes a tangible advantage of second- and third-generation CHAT over its earlier Vygotskian ancestor, which focused on mediated action in relative isolation Third generation activity theory is the application of \"Activity Systems Analysis\" (ASA) in developmental research where investigators take a participatory and interventionist role in the participants' activities and change their experiences. Engeström's now famous diagram, or \"basic activity triangle\", – (which adds rules/norms, intersubjective community relations, and division of labor, as well as multiple activity systems sharing an object) – has become the principal third generation model among the research community for analysing individuals and groups. Engeström summarizes the current state of CHAT with five principles:\nMost often, learning technologists have used third-generation CHAT as a guiding theoretical framework to understand how technologies are adopted, adapted, and configured through use in complex social situations.\n\nFrom the 1960s onwards, starting in the global South, and independently from the mainstream \"European\" developmental line, Leontiev's core \"Objective Activity\" concept has been used in a Social Development context. In the Organization Workshop's Large Group Capacitation-method, \"objective/ized activity\" acts as the core causal principle which postulates that, in order to change the mind-set of (large groups of) individuals, we need to start with changes to their activity – and/or to the object that \"suggests\" their activity. In Leontievian vein, the Organization Workshop is all about semiotically-mediated activities through which (large groups of) participants \"learn how to manage themselves and the organizations they create to perform tasks that require a complex division of labor\".\n\nEspecially over the last two decades, CHAT has offered a theoretical lens informing research and practice, in that it posits that learning takes place through collective activities that are purposefully conducted around a common object. Starting from the premise that learning is a social and cultural process that draws on historical achievements, its systems thinking-based perspectives allow insights into the real world.\n\nChange Laboratory (CL) is a CHAT-based method for formative intervention in activity systems and for research on their developmental potential as well as processes of expansive learning, collaborative concept-formation, and transformation of practices, elaborated in the mid-nineties by the Finnish Developmental Work Research (DWR) group.\nThe CL method relies on collaboration between the practitioners of the activity being analyzed and transformed, and academic researchers or interventionists supporting and facilitating collective developmental processes. On the basis of Engeström's theory of \"expansive learning\", the foundation of an interventionist research approach at DWR was elaborated in the 1980s, and developed further in the 1990s as an intervention method now known as \"Change Laboratory\". CL interventions are used both to study the conditions of change and to help those working in organizations to develop their work, drawing on participant observation, interviews, and the recording and videotaping of meetings and work practices. Initially, with the help of an external interventionist, the first stimulus that \"is beyond the actors' present capabilities\", is produced in the Change Laboratory by collecting first-hand empirical data on problematic aspects of the activity. This data may comprise difficult client cases, descriptions of recurrent disturbances and ruptures in the process of producing the outcome. Steps in the CL process: Step 1 Questioning; Step 2 Analysis; Step 3 Modeling; Step 4 Examining; Step 5 Implementing; Step 6 Reflecting; Step 7 Consolidating. These seven action steps for increased understanding are described by Engeström as \"expansive learning\", or phases of an outwardly expanding spiral, while multiple kinds of actions can take place at any time. The phases of the model simply allow for the identification and analysis of the dominant action type during a particular period of time. These learning actions are provoked by contradictions. CL is used by a team or work unit or by collaborating partners across the organizational boundaries, initially with the help of an interventionist-researcher. The CL method has been used in agricultural contexts, educational and media settings, health care and learning support.\n\n\"Activity systems analysis\" is a CHAT-based method, discussed in / and in Cole & Engeström, 1993, for understanding human activity in real-world situations with data collection, analysis, and presentation methods that address the complexities of human activity in natural settings aimed to advance both theory and practice. It is based on Vygotsky's concept of mediated action and captures human activity in a triangle model that includes the subject, tool, object, rule, community, and division of labor. Subjects are participants in an activity, motivated toward a purpose or attainment of the object. The object can be the goal of an activity, the subject's motives for participating in an activity, and the material products that subjects gain through an activity. Tools are socially shared cognitive and/or material resources that subjects can use to attain the object. Informal or formal rules regulate the subject's participation while engaging in an activity. The community is the group or organization to which subjects belong. The division of labor is the shared participation responsibilities in the activity determined by the community. Finally, the outcome is the consequences that the subject faces because of his/her actions driven by the object. These outcomes can encourage or hinder the subject's participation in future activities. In Part 2 of her video \"Using Activity Theory to understand human behaviour\", shows how activity theory is applied to the problem of behavior change and HIV and AIDs (in South Africa). The video focuses on sexual activity as the activity of the system, and illustrates how an \"Activity System Analysis\", through a historical and current account of the activity, provides a way of understanding lack of behavior change in response to HIV and AIDS. In her eponymous book \"Activity Systems Analysis Methods.\", describes seven ASA case studies which fall \"into four distinct work clusters. These clusters include works that help (a) understand developmental work research (DWR), (b) describe real-world learning situations, (c) design human computer interaction systems, and (d) plan solutions to complicated work-based problems\". Other uses of ASA: Summarizing organizational change; Identifying guidelines for designing Constructivist Learning Environments; Identifying contradictions and tensions that shape developments in educational settings; Demonstrating historical developments in organizational learning., and Evaluating K–12 school and university partnership relations.\n\nWhen HCI first appeared on the scene as a separate field of study in the early 1980s, HCI adopted the information processing paradigm of computer science as the model for human cognition, predicated on prevalent cognitive psychology criteria, which, it was soon realized, failed to account for individuals' interests, needs and frustrations involved, nor of the fact that the technology critically depends on complex, meaningful, social, and dynamic contexts in which it takes place. Adopting a CHAT theoretical perspective had important implications for understanding how people use interactive technologies: the realization, for example, that a computer is typically an object of activity rather than a mediating artefact means that people interact with the world through computers, rather than with computer 'objects'. A number of diverse methodologies outlining techniques for human–computer interaction design have emerged since the rise of the field in the 1980s. Most design methodologies stem from a model for how users, designers, and technical systems interact. Bonnie Nardi produced the – hitherto – most applicable collection of activity theoretical HCI literature.\n\nSSAT builds on the general theory of activity to provide an effective basis for both experimental and analytic methods of studying human performance, using carefully developed units of analysis SSAT approaches cognition both as a process and as a structured system of actions or other functional information-processing units, developing a taxonomy of human activity through the use of structurally organized units of analysis. The systemic-structural approach to activity design and analysis involves identifying the available means of work, tools and objects; their relationship with possible strategies of work activity; existing constraints on activity performance; social norms and rules; possible stages of object transformation; and changes in the structure of activity during skills acquisition.This method is demonstrated by applying it to the study of a human–computer interaction task.\n\nThe strengths of CHAT are grounded both in its long historical roots and extensive contemporary use: it offers a philosophical and cross-disciplinary perspective for analyzing diverse human practices as development processes in which both individual and social levels are interlinked, as well as interactions and boundary-crossings. between activity systems More recently, the focus of studies of organizational learning has increasingly shifted away from learning within single organizations or organizational units, towards learning in multi‐organizational or inter‐organizational networks, as well as to the exploration and better understanding of interactions in their social context, multiple contexts and cultures, and the dynamics and development of particular activities. This shift has generated, among others, such concepts as \"networks of learning\" and \"networked learning\", coworking, and knotworking. Industry of late has seen strong growth in nonemployer firms (NEFs), thanks to changes in long-term employment trends and developments in mobile technology which have led to more work from remote locations, more distance collaboration, and more work organized around temporary projects. Developments such as these and new forms of social production or commons-based peer production, such as e.g. open source development and cultural production in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, have become a key focus in Engeström's more recent work.\n\nThe rapid rise of new forms of activities characterised by web-based social and participatory practices, \n, phenomena such as distributed workforce and the dominance of knowledge work, prompts a rethink of the third generation model, bringing with it the need, as suggested by Engestrōm, for a new, \"fourth generation\" activity system model. which activity theorists indeed have been working on in recent years. In fourth generation CHAT, the object(ive) will typically comprise multiple perspectives and contexts and be inherently transient; collaborations between actors, too, are likely to be temporary, with multiple boundary crossings between interrelated activities. Fourth-generation activity theorists have specifically developed activity theory to better accommodate Castells's (and others') insights into how work organization has shifted in the network society: they hence will focus less on the workings of individual activity systems (often represented by triangles) and more on the interactions across activity systems functioning in networks. The 2017 ISCAR congress (August, Quebec City) has the following theme: \"\"Taking a 360° view of the landscape of cultural-historical activity research:The state of our scholarship in practice\".\n\n\n\n"}

Fish prepared as \"daing\" are usually split open (though they may be left whole), gutted, salted liberally, and then sun and air-dried. There are also \"boneless\" variants which fillets the fish before the drying process. It was originally a preservation technique, as salt inhibits the growth of bacteria, allowing fish to be stored for long periods of time.\nA variant of \"daing\" known as labtingaw uses less salt and is dried for a much shorter period (only a few hours). The resulting \"daing\" is still slightly moist and meatier than the fully dried variant. Yet another variant of \"daing\" known as lamayo, does away with the drying process altogether. Instead, after the fish is cleaned, it is simply marinated in vinegar, garlic and other spices before frying. \n\n\"Daing\" is considered poverty food due to its relative cheapness. But it has gained significance in Philippine culture as comfort food. One of the most popular comfort food \"daing\" is \"danggit\" or \"dangguit.\" Danggit, dried rabbitfish, is usually simply fried before consumption and served with rice and a dip (usually vinegar or calamansi). As breakfast food, they may be served with fried eggs. \n\nIn Central and Southern Philippines, \"daing\" is known as \"bulad\" or \"buwad\" in Cebuano. The variants which use sliced and gutted fish are known as \"pinikas\" (literally \"halved\" referring to the halves of the fish). Northern regions usually do not distinguish between the two, though some may use \"daing\" to refer exclusively to the halved and gutted variants, while \"tuyô\" is used for all variants. \n\nVirtually any fish can be prepared as \"daing\". The species of fish used is usually identified by name when sold in markets. For example, in Cebu, the local specialty which uses rabbitfish (\"Siganus\" spp., locally known as \"danggit\"), is called \"buwad danggit\". Other fish species used include threadfin breams (Nemipteridae, locally known as \"bisugo\"); grey mullets (Mugilidae, locally known as \"banak\"); and sardines (\"Sardinella\" spp. and \"Dussumieria acuta\", locally known as \"tunsoy\" or \"tamban\"). \"Daing\" made from sardines are usually dried whole, though exported variants may be gutted to comply with food laws in other countries. Cuttlefish and squid may also be prepared this way (Tagalog: \"daing na pusit\"; Cebuano: \"bulad pusit\").\n\n"}

It is stylistically descended from early military marches, and related to military cadences, as both are a means of providing a beat while marching. Usually, each instrument will have a part that mimics a specific drum or drums on a drum set to create a sound similar to a drum beat.\n\nAccording to \"Hiro Songsblog\" a drum cadence is, \"'a drumline piece played in a parading marching band between or in place of full-band pieces'. Cadences, are also: 'a chant that is sung by military personnel while parading or marching'.\"\n\nCadences employ the four basic drum strokes and often directly include drum rudiments. They have a wide range of difficulty, from simple accent patterns to complex rhythms including hybrid rudiments, and are played by virtually every modern drum line. Cadences are important from a performance standpoint, as a good drum cadence can make the band stand out from the rest in competition. Field shows are often preceded by the band marching to the beat of the cadence.\n\nMarching percussion generally consists of at least snare drums, tenor drums, cymbals, and bass drums, and may include timpani.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1276784", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1276784", "title": "Elective mutism", "text": "Elective mutism\n\nElective mutism is a now outdated term which was defined as a refusal to speak in almost all social situations (despite normal ability to do so), while selective mutism was considered to be a \"failure\" to speak in specific situations and is strongly associated with social anxiety disorder. In contrast to selective mutism, it was thought someone who was electively mute may not speak in any situation, as is usually shown in books and movies. Elective mutism was often attributed to defiance or the effect of trauma. Those who are able to speak freely in some situations but not in others are now better described by selective mutism.\n\nIn 1877, a German physician named the disorder \"aphasia voluntaria\" to describe children who were able to speak normally but often \"refused\" to.\n\nIn 1980, a study by Torey Hayden identified four \"subtypes\" of Elective Mutism:\n\nThe \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" (DSM), first published in 1952, first included Elective Mutism in its third edition, published in 1980. Elective mutism was described as \"a continuous refusal to speak in almost all social situations\" despite normal ability to speak. While \"excessive shyness\" and other anxiety-related traits were listed as associated features, predisposing factors included \"maternal overprotection\", mental retardation, and trauma. Elective mutism in the third edition revised (DSM III-R) is described similarly as in the third edition except for specifying that the disorder is \"not\" related to social anxiety disorder.\n\nIn 1994, the fourth edition of the DSM reflected the name change to selective mutism and redefined the disorder.\n\nThough elective mutism is no longer recognized by most psychiatrists, it is a popular character element or plot point in stories and movies. Many characters choose to stop speaking, for various reasons. Even more commonly, there are also characters who stop speaking after a traumatic incident. In both these cases, often, and almost always in the second, the character is silent in all situations. This is therefore not selective mutism, and anxiety is very rarely involved. Selective mutism itself is almost nonexistent in pop culture.\n\nThe following are a few references to stories including a character who does not speak despite being physically able to.\n\n"}
{"id": "163494", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=163494", "title": "Equus (play)", "text": "Equus (play)\n\nEquus is a play by Peter Shaffer written in 1973, telling the story of a psychiatrist who attempts to treat a young man who has a pathological religious fascination with horses.\n\nShaffer was inspired to write \"Equus\" when he heard of a crime involving a 17-year-old who blinded six horses in a small town near Suffolk. He set out to construct a fictional account of what might have caused the incident, without knowing any of the details of the crime. The play's action is something of a detective story, involving the attempts of the child psychiatrist Dr. Martin Dysart to understand the cause of the boy's actions while wrestling with his own sense of purpose.\n\nThe original stage production ran at the National Theatre in London between 1973 and 1975, directed by John Dexter. Alec McCowen played Dysart, and Peter Firth played Alan Strang. Later came the Broadway productions that starred Anthony Hopkins as Dysart (later played by Richard Burton, Leonard Nimoy, and Anthony Perkins) and from the London production, Peter Firth as Alan. When Firth left for Broadway, Dai Bradley took over the role of Alan in the London production, playing opposite Michael Jayston as Dr. Dysart. Tom Hulce replaced Firth during the Broadway run. The Broadway production ran for 1,209 performances. Marian Seldes appeared in every single performance of the Broadway run, first in the role of Hesther and then as Dora. Shaffer also adapted his play for a 1977 film of the same name.\n\nNumerous other issues inform the narrative. Most important are religious and ritual sacrifice themes, and the manner in which character Alan Strang constructs a personal theology involving the horses and the supreme godhead, \"Equus\". Alan sees the horses as representative of God and confuses his adoration of his \"God\" with sexual attraction. Also important is Shaffer's examination of the conflict between personal values and satisfaction and societal mores, expectations, and institutions. In reference to the play's classical structure, themes, and characterisation, Shaffer has discussed the conflict between Apollonian and Dionysian values and systems in human life.\n\nMartin Dysart is a psychiatrist in a mental hospital. He begins with a monologue in which he outlines the case of 17-year-old Alan Strang, who blinded six horses. He also divulges his feeling that his occupation is not all that he wishes it to be and his feelings of dissatisfaction and disappointment about his barren life. Dysart finds that the supply of troubled young people for him to \"adjust\" back into \"normal\" living is never-ending, but he doubts the value of treating these youths, since they will simply return to a dull, normal life that lacks any commitment and \"worship\" (a recurring theme). He comments that Alan Strang's crime was extreme, but adds that just such extremity is needed to break free from the chains of existence.\n\nA court magistrate, Hesther Saloman, visits Dysart, believing that he has the skills to help Alan come to terms with what he did. At the hospital, Dysart has a great deal of difficulty making any kind of headway with Alan, who at first responds to questioning by singing TV advertising jingles.\n\nDysart reveals a dream he has had, in a Grecian/Homeric setting, in which he is a public official presiding over a mass ritual sacrifice. Dysart slices open the abdomens of hundreds of children, and pulls out their entrails. He becomes disgusted with what he is doing, but fears being murdered in the same manner as the children if he is discovered as a \"non-believer\" by the other priests, so he does not stop. Eventually the other priests, aware of his misgivings, grab the knife from his hand before he awakens from the dream.\n\nDysart interviews Alan's parents. He learns that, from an early age, Alan has been receiving conflicting viewpoints on religion from his parents. Alan's mother, Dora, is a devout Christian who has read to him daily from the Bible. This practice has antagonized Alan's father Frank, a nonbeliever.\n\nSlowly, Dysart makes contact with Alan by playing a game where each of them asks a question, which must be answered honestly.\n\nDysart learns that Frank, concerned that Alan has taken far too much interest in the more violent aspects of the Bible, destroyed a violent picture of the Crucifixion that Alan had hung at the foot of his bed. Alan replaced the picture with one of a horse, with large, staring eyes.\n\nAlan reveals to Dysart that during his youth, he had established his attraction to horses by way of his mother's biblical tales, a horse story that she had read to him, Western movies, and his grandfather's interest in horses and riding. Alan's sexual training began with his mother who told him he could find true love and contentment by way of religious devotion and marriage. During this time, Alan also begins to develop a sexual attraction to horses, desiring to pet their thick coats, feel their muscular bodies, and smell their sweat. Alan reveals to Dysart that he had first encountered a horse at age six, on the beach. A rider approached him, and took him up on the horse. Alan was visibly excited, but his parents found him and Frank pulled him violently off the horse. The horse rider scoffed at the father and rode off.\n\nDysart hypnotizes Alan, and during the hypnosis, Dysart reveals elements of his terrifying dream of the ritual murder of children. Dysart begins to jog Alan's memory by filling in blanks, and asking questions. Alan reveals that he wants to help the horses by removing the bit, which enslaves them.\n\nAfter turning 17, Alan took a job working in a shop selling electrical goods, where he met Jill Mason, an outgoing and free-spirited young woman. She visits the shop wanting to purchase blades for horse-clippers. Alan was instantly interested when he discovered that Jill has such close contact with horses after she tells him that she works for a local stable owner. Jill suggested that Alan work for the owner of the stables, Harry Dalton, and Alan agrees.\n\nDysart meets with Dalton, who tells him that he first held Alan to be a model worker, since he kept the stables immaculately clean and grooms the horses, including one named Nugget. Through Dysart's questioning, it becomes clear that Alan is erotically fixated on Nugget (or 'Equus') and secretly takes him for midnight rides, bareback and naked. Alan also envisions himself as a king, on the godhead Equus, both destroying their enemies.\n\nDysart gives Alan a placebo \"truth pill\". Revealing a tryst with Jill, he begins to re-enact the event. Jill, who had taken an interest in Alan, had asked him to take her to a porno theater. While there, they both ran into Frank. Alan was traumatized, particularly when he realized that his father was lying when he tried to justify his presence in the theater. However, this occurrence allows Alan to realize that sex is a natural thing for all men... even his father. Alan walks Jill home after they leave. She convinces Alan to come to the stables with her.\n\nOnce there, Jill seduces Alan and the two undress and attempt to have sex. However, Alan breaks this off when he hears the horses making noises in the stables beneath, which he decides is the reason for his inability to get an erection. Jill tries to ask Alan what the problem is, but he shouts at her to leave. After Jill dresses and walks out of the stables, the still nude Alan begs the horses for forgiveness, as he sees the horses as God-like figures. \"Mine!...You're mine!...I am yours and you are mine!\" cries Equus through Dysart's voice, but then he becomes threatening: \"The Lord thy God is a jealous God,\" Equus/Dysart seethes, \"He sees you, he sees you forever and ever, Alan. He sees you!...He sees you!\" Alan screams, \"God seest!\" and then he says \"No more. No more, Equus!\" Alan then uses a steel spike to blind the six horses in the stable, whose eyes have \"seen\" his very soul.\n\nThe final scene has another monologue by Dysart questioning the fundamentals of his practice and whether or not what he does will actually help Alan, as the effect of his treatment will make him \"normal\" at the cost of his humanity.\n\nThe play opened on Broadway at the Plymouth Theatre on 24 October 1974, ending on 11 September 1976. It then opened at the Helen Hayes Theatre on 5 October 1976, ending on 2 October 1977, for a total of 1,209 performances.\n\nShaffer adapted the play for a 1977 film starring Richard Burton, Peter Firth, Eileen Atkins, Colin Blakely, Joan Plowright, and Jenny Agutter, directed by Sidney Lumet. Unlike stage productions, where the horses are portrayed by human actors, often muscular men wearing tribal-style masks, Lumet did not believe this could adequately be done in a film version, concluding a degree of realism was required, \"because the reality he [Alan] was being watched in was going to create the dilemma within him.\"\n\nComparing the film to the play, English Professor James M. Welsh felt using real horses in the film was understandable, but argued the outdoor scenes infringed on the \"abstract theatrical design\" that gave the play its creativity. Welsh also felt the explicit blinding was \"potentially repulsive,\" and \"much of the spirit of the play is lost as a consequence.\"\n\nThe Midwest premiere of \"Equus\" opened March 1978 in Lansing, Michigan, at Boarshead Theatre. Directed by John Peakes, it featured Richard Thomsen as Dysart, David Kropp as Alan, Carmen Decker as Dora, and Lisa Hodge as Jill. Local controversy over the nude scene was largely mitigated by casting a married couple as Jill and Alan. This production went on to win Boarshead Theatre's annual awards for Best Production and Best Supporting Actor (Kropp).\n\n\"Equus\" was also presented in Baltimore in 1979 by the Lovegrove Alley Theatre. The production starred a pre-Broadway Charles S. Dutton in the role of Dysart. Director Brad Mays did double duty in the role of Alan Strang. A young actress named Lauren Raher played Jill Mason, and her real-life mother Rhona Raher portrayed Dora, Alan's mother.\n\"Equus\" was revived in 2007 in the West End by producers David Pugh and Dafydd Rogers, starring Richard Griffiths, Daniel Radcliffe, and Joanna Christie in the leading roles. The production was directed by Thea Sharrock, and opened in February 2007 at the Gielgud Theatre. The production attracted press attention, as both Radcliffe and Griffiths appeared in the \"Harry Potter\" film series (as Harry Potter and Vernon Dursley, respectively). In particular, the casting of then 17-year-old Radcliffe caused some controversy since the role of Alan Strang required him to appear nude on stage. Radcliffe insisted that the nude scene was not \"gratuitous\" and that he should portray the character and the scene as called for by the script. The 2007 London revival was then transferred to Broadway, at the Broadhurst Theatre, running through 8 February 2009. Radcliffe and Griffiths reprised their roles, and Thea Sharrock returned as director. The cast also included Kate Mulgrew, Anna Camp, Carolyn McCormick, Lorenzo Pisoni, T. Ryder Smith, Graeme Malcolm, and Sandra Shipley, with Collin Baja, Tyrone Jackson, Spencer Liff, Adesola Osakalumi, and Marc Spaulding. Radcliffe eventually received a nomination for the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actor in a Play.\n\nThe first illustrated edition of the play text was produced as a large-format artist's book by the Old Stile Press, with images and an afterword by the British artist Clive Hicks-Jenkins, in 2009.\n\n\"Equus\" was revived in San Jose, California, in March 2011 at City Lights Theater Company. This production, featuring actors Sean Gilvary as Alan Strang and Steve Lambert as Martin Dysart, received rave reviews. \"The Mercury News\" labeled Gilvary and Lambert as \"haunting,\" stating Gilvary \"...exposing emotions and epidermis, rides bareback in every sense. He gradually manages to make a rather unattractive young creature seem not only sympathetic but redeemable while retaining his hostility and humanity.\" Starkinsider rated the production 4.5 out of 5 stars, calling Lambert \"superb\" and having a \"pitch-perfect performance,\" while calling Gilvary \"dazzling\" and having \"a preternatural ability to inhabit the very soul of his character. Like the troubled teen that he portrays, both he and Strang possess a passion for something that is an inseparable part of their personality.\" This production received a Standout Classic Production Award by Silicon Valley Small Theatre Awards.\n\n\"Equus\" was revived in Houston, Texas, for a limited run in July 2014 at Frenetic Theater. The production was largely funded by donations on Kickstarter and was well received by critics and audiences alike. Broadway World called the production 'dark, daunting and sensual' and commending its 'stellar cast'. Houston Press said it was 'astonishingly good... a must see' while Culturemap listed the show as one of the hottest shows of the year.\n\n"}

{"id": "443297", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=443297", "title": "Fur farming", "text": "Fur farming\n\nFur farming is the practice of breeding or raising certain types of animals for their fur.\n\nFur used from animals caught in the wild is not considered farmed fur, and is instead known as \"wild fur\".\nMost of the world’s farmed fur is produced by European farmers. There are 5,000 fur farms in the EU, all located across 22 countries; these areas of production collectively account for 50% of the global production of farmed fur.\nThe EU accounts for 63% of global mink production and 70% of fox production. Denmark is the leading mink-producing country, accounting for approximately 28% of world production. Other major producers include China, the Netherlands, Russia, and the U.S. Finland is the largest United States supplier of fox pelts.\nThe United States is a major exporter of fur skins. Major export markets include China, Russia, Canada, and the EU. Exports to Asia as a share of total exports grew from 22% in 1998 to 47% in 2002.\nChina is the largest importer of fur pelts in the world and the largest exporter of finished fur products.\n\nFur farming is banned in Austria, Croatia, the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic (effective in 2019) and Norway In Germany and Switzerland, the regulations for fur farming are very strict, with the result that there are no fur farms. Some other countries have a ban on fur farming of certain types of animals.\n\nDemand fell in the late 1980s and 1990s because of a number of factors, including the failure of designers to come up with exciting new lines, and the efforts of animal rights campaigners. Since the turn of the millennium, however, sales worldwide have soared to record highs, fueled by radically new techniques for working with fur, and a sharp rise in disposable income in China and Russia. This growing demand has led to the development of extensive fur farming operations in China and Poland.\n\nWhile wearing fur clothing in cold weather as protection goes back to the Stone Age, the source for this material came from the wild. As human populations grew, furs, leathers, and hides for use in clothing came from farm stock, such as sheep (sheepskin), rabbits, cattle, pigs, and goats. The earliest records of breeding mink for fur in North America were in the 1860s. Foxes were first raised on farms for fur in Prince Edward Island in Canada in 1895.\n\nHistorically, the fur trade played an important economic role in the United States. Fur trappers explored and opened up large parts of North America, and the fashion for beaver hats led to intense competition for the raw materials. Starting in the latter half of the 20th century, producers and wearers of fur have been criticized by animal rights activists because of the perceived cruelty they believe is involved in animal trapping and because of the availability of substitutes such as synthetic fibers (made from petroleum oil).\n\nToday, 80 percent of the fur clothing industry's pelts come from animals raised on farms. The rest is from animals caught in the wild. The most farmed fur-bearing animal is the mink (50 million annually), followed by the fox (about 4 million annually). Asiatic and Finnish raccoon and chinchilla are also farmed for their fur. 64 percent of fur farms are in Northern Europe, 11 percent are in North America, and the rest are dispersed throughout the world, in countries such as Argentina and Russia.\n\nMink have been farmed for fur in the United States for 130 years. In 2010, the U.S. ranked fifth in production behind Denmark, China, the Netherlands, and Poland. Mink typically breed in March and give birth to their litters in May. Farmers vaccinate the young kits for botulism, distemper, enteritis, and, if needed, pneumonia. They are killed in November and December. Methods for euthanizing animals on fur farms, as on all farms, are detailed in the American Veterinary Medical Association's Report on Euthanasia which is used as a guideline for state departments of agriculture which have jurisdiction over all farms raising domesticated livestock, including mink.\n\nThe white mink, a northern European breed, was introduced into Canada in 1968. Most mink production in Canada occurs in Nova Scotia which, with 116 licensed farms in 2016, generated revenues of nearly $54 million by contributing approximately 1.4 million pelts to global markets. That accounted for an average of half of all Canada's mink pelts . Production of black mink in particular has grown significantly since 2000, with emerging markets in Russia, China, and South Korea accounting for most of the new demand. Black mink was first bred in Nova Scotia in the late 1950s and has proven popular as a versatile colour. Most Nova Scotia product is sold in China where it is manufactured into luxury garments.\n\nThe international trade in chinchilla fur goes back to the 16th century and the animal (whose name literally means \"Little Chincha\") is named after the Chincha people of the Andes, who wore its soft, dense fur. By the end of the 19th century, chinchillas had become quite rare. In 1923, Mathias F. Chapman brought the eleven wild chinchillas he had captured to the U.S. for breeding. Only three of these were female. Empress Chinchilla is the breeders association for the chinchilla farmers, many of whom are based in the United States, including California. Empress Chinchilla runs a certification program for farmers.\n\nFinland is the world's leading producer of fox pelts. In the United States, fox production is about 10,000 pelts, produced in about 10 states. Wisconsin and Utah have the most mink farms in the USA. Canada produces ten to fifteen times as many fox furs as the USA.\n\nThe United States banned the import, export, and sale of products made from dog and cat fur in 2000.\nItaly, France, Denmark, Greece, Belgium, and Australia ban the import of domestic cat and dog fur but the sale is still quasi-legal. \nIn most countries, novelty items made from farmed cat and dog fur is available in the form of animal toys or as trim on garments like boots, jackets and handbags. The European Union banned imports in 2009.\n\n The main breed in the rabbit fur farming industry is the Rex (Castor Rex and Chinchilla Rex). Breeding animals are kept for up to 3 years, and usually give birth twice a year. The kits are taken from their mothers at 4 weeks old and put in a nursery with other kits. After this, the mothers are kept separated from their kits, and they get put together only for feeding. When the kits are 7 to 8 weeks old, they are put in solitary cages, where they are kept for about 6–7 months, and are harvested after they have shed their winter fur. The rabbits are kept in bare wire mesh cages. A cage for one rabbit has the floor space of about two shoe boxes. The mortality rate for caged Rex is 10 – 15%, mostly from respiratory disease.\n\nDuring this time of year, ranchers are primarily focused on bringing their selected mink into a good condition that is suitable for breeding. Mink are a monoestrous species that undergo delayed implantation when bred successfully, this means that the breeding season can be the most strenuous time of year both in terms of animal nutrition and human labor. It is essential that management practices employ a feeding program that maintains a nutritional diet that is adequate for both male and female mink. A feeding program that encourages the removal of excess weight and an environment that facilitates an increase in exercise is important for good production and a successful whelp. Mink are usually fed once or twice a day during the growing season; on most farms they are fed the same quantity of food on all cages and close to an \"ad libitum\" amount so that 50% of all cages have feed left over the next day. Not only does the rancher select for fur quality and production traits, their major concentration is on the health and temperament of the animal; all of these traits will correlate with the overall welfare of the herd. .\nBreeding records are kept for each individual mink, this includes information on the dates of mating, genetics involving family lineage, reproductive success, health status, and fur characteristics. .\n\nIn preparation for whelping, comfortable conditions are prepared for the female by providing ample aspen bedding in which she can create a nest. It is well-known that female mink are highly motivated to perform maternal-related nest building during the majority of their gestation period , this is why providing an abundance of substrate to prepare a nest is crucial to maintain the animals welfare. Unnecessary stress and noises are avoided so due to the sensitivity of female mink during late gestation. Gestation varies from 40-70 days, this time is often shortened by extending the daylight period by use of artificial lighting. .\nFemales give birth to 5-6 kits on average. Since kits are born altricial, the female spends most of her time in the nest boxes caring for them. Mink kits are fully dependent on the dam's milk and will nurse for the first four weeks of their life. Maternal care is essential to promote offspring survival and growth, particularly in American mink who give birth to altricial young. Ranchers will check them regularly to ensure all the kits are warm, receiving enough milk, and are growing well. Females can loose significant body condition during lactation so their health is monitored by visual observations of behavior, appearance, and feed consumption..\nWeaning takes place when the kits reach approximately 6-8 weeks old. The changes that take place during weaning can be stressful for both dam and kits therefore is done at a time that is most beneficial for the mother and litter. Ranchers will ensure the kits are able to consume solid feed and drink water independently before they are ready for weaning. .\n\nVery rapid growth takes place during the growth phase of the production cycle. For about 10-11 weeks, it is critical that the juvenile kits have access to adequate amounts of feed that is formulated to meet their nutritional needs. Maintaining a feeding routine that allows for multiple distributions of feed a day will help keep feed fresh and encourage appetite. . In July, all mink (including kits and adult breeders) are vaccinated to prevent diseases and promote health and welfare of the herd. Once August arrives, the skeletal growth of kits is complete and the subsequent growth of primarily fat begins. The growth of fur predominantly takes place during the fall where it begins at the tail and continues up the back and to the head. Ranchers maintain a clean, healthy environment during this time by performing daily husbandry practices, this includes; cleaning nest boxes, removal of surrounding debris and manure from the barn, bedding the cages, and up-keeping the cleanliness of the facility and farming equipment. Ranchers are diligent toward creating an environment that prioritizes the welfare of each animal and allows them to live and function comfortably within their environment.\n\nMink are carefully evaluated in November or early December in order to physically assess their coat color, characteristics, and quality. Fur quality, along with skin size are two of the most important traits that are under intense selection in most mink breeding programs. Each mink will be given a grade dictated by the attributes of their coat; this is valuable in determining which mink will be kept as breeding stock for next season. Fur quality, color, and body size are judged by the farmer or a professional grader. Fur grades are often used alongside size, weight, health history, parent reproductive success, litter size, and temperament to assess the quality and potential of each animal.\nMink are harvested in December and methods are used to euthanize each animal so that their death is quick, humane, and as painless as possible. Several techniques have been considered proper to euthanize farmed mink, these include; neck breaking, electricity, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, argon, and lethal injection. The most common method of harvesting is by subjecting the animal to a chamber that contains carbon monoxide. \nPelting takes place either on site or upon shipping the mink to an offsite operation. .\n\nAfter pelting, fur farms dispose of their dead animals as economically as possible. The mink bodies are typically sent for either incineration or rendering where they can be converted into bone and meat meal. The meat from most fur-bearers is not usually eaten by humans, therefore the carcasses will go on to become various products such as pet food, animal feed, organic compost, fertilizer, paint, and even tires. Carcasses sometimes go to animal sanctuaries, zoos, and aquariums to feed animals, and some end up as crab bait. Some biological supply companies offer preserved skinned carcasses of ranched mink for classroom dissection specimens as an alternative to cats or other domesticated mammals. Mink feces are used as organic crop fertiliser, and mink fat is turned into oil to manufacture soap, face oils, cosmetics, and leather treatments.\n\nOnce acting as a way to symbolize ones social status, fur garments are now recognized as a unique fashion item that is desired by consumers all around the world. Using products that are sustainable and environmentally friendly has become a top priority to many global citizens and real fur products offer a way in which to support these initiatives. Real fur is an organic material that remains as one of the most eco-friendly fabrics in the fashion industry . Many synthetic materials such as fake fur are made using petrochemicals; these materials do not easily break down and will remain in landfills for centuries. By wearing real fur instead of fake, consumers can decrease the lasting environmental impacts of fast fashion. When maintained and treated with care, fur can withhold a resilient and long lasting nature and even be passed done for many generations. While they are designed to be durable and functional for decades of use, fur garments will eventually deteriorate and return to nature; since it is an animal product and biodegradable, it can be easily composted and reused. Not only is authentic fur recyclable, but its production is a renewable resource. Pelts that are produced commercially come from domestic mink that are selectively bred and harvested each year; no interference with wild or endangered species takes places to produce a farmed mink pelt. With the proper care and and eye for fashion, a fur garment can even be reinvented from a coat to jacket to vest to liner, to home accessory. \n\nAnti-fur activists have claimed that methods used on fur farms are focused on maximizing profits at the expense of the welfare of fur producing animals.\n\nAs with other types of animal farming, living conditions of animals vary, and extreme cases are of much contention. According to PETA, the majority of fur farmers pack animals into small cages, preventing them from taking more than a few steps back and forth. PETA claims foxes and other animals suffer as a result of the confined environment, and may even cannibalize each other as a reaction to their confinement.\nIn other cases, as with passing of animal welfare legislation in Italy, animals are required to be given enriched living environments in which they can climb on branches, dig holes, use a nest of 50 × 50 cm and also have a water basin of at least 2 × 2 metres and 50 cm deep in which to swim. Farmers argue that 50 years ago, the animals were kept in large outdoor holding areas, with pools of water. However, such farms resulted in high disease rates for the animals and were not practical.\nFarmers claim that today's farmed animals only know farm life as they have been domesticated through over hundreds of years of selective breeding.\nThe methods used for slaughtering the animals on farms and in the wild vary depending on the animal. For farmed mink, the American Veterinary Medical Association researches the best methods and publishes a report on the subject every 7 to 10 years. This report is used to guide state departments of agriculture which have jurisdiction over farm animals, including farm-raised mink. For those harvesting wild furs, biologists and wildlife managers dictate seasons, method of slaughter, and numbers of animals to be harvested.\n\nAfter UK mink farmers were subjected to almost daily protests, they agreed to shut down their farming in exchange for compensation in England and Wales in 2000. At second reading, the ban in England and Wales was justified principally on grounds of public morality. Prior to the ban, there had been 11 fur farms in the UK producing about 100,000 pelts annually. Although the last fur farm in Scotland had closed in 1993, the Scottish Parliament nevertheless banned fur farming in 2002. Fur farming was also banned in Northern Ireland in 2002 under the Fur Farming (Prohibition) (Northern Ireland) Order 2002.\n\nIn Austria, six of the nine federal states have banned fur farming, and the remaining three enforce such strict welfare regulations, in relation to the availability of swimming water, that fur farming is no longer economically viable.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland there are currently three fur farms in operation. These farms focus mainly on the trade of mink fur (some farms which have used fox fur are currently winding down operation as such trade is no longer economically viable). In 2006, approximately 170,000 mink and 300 foxes were harvested in the Republic of Ireland. Furs are exported from the Republic of Ireland to other EU member states or to countries in Asia and North America. In the Republic of Ireland, fur farms are monitored by the Department of Agriculture, and welfare standards of Ireland and the European Union must be adhered to at all times. In October 2009, there were discussions within the political sphere on the banning of fur farms in the Republic of Ireland. Animal welfare groups have welcomed such proposals, though concern has been highlighted, in terms of its impact on rural communities where alternative industries are scarce. Fur farming in the Republic of Ireland contributes about €15 million per year to the economy. A ban was subsequently passed before being overturned by Minister for Agriculture at the time Simon Coveney of Fine Gael after the party formed a new government following the 2011 election. There is a renewed campaign and ongoing efforts to push the Irish government or current Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed to re-implement a phase-out ban. \n\nFur farming of chinchillas and foxes is banned. Legislation to phase out mink fur farming (and thereby effectively all fur farming) by 2024 was approved by the end of 2012.\n\nThe State Forestry Administration (SFA) is set to offer training courses for fur farmers.\nLegislation was drafted in September 2009 to address any cruelty to animals in China. If passed, the legislation would regulate how farm animals are raised, transported, and slaughtered.\nIn 2005, animals right group The Swiss Animal Protection accused the Chinese of skinning fur-bearing animals including the \"Asiatic raccoon\" (raccoon dog) while still alive, and produced a controversial video on the subject. The China Fur Commission and China Leather Industry Association challenged the authenticity of the video, stating: \"Pictures showing animals being skinned alive are obviously plotted. All those with common sense would not choose this slaughter method to attain fur.\" The government of Suning County, Hebei Province also issued a statement, outlining welfare practices it claimed to practice on its fur farms and calling the alleged practice of skinning animals alive \"unimaginable.\" Swiss Animal Protection later published a video showing the live skinning of raccoon dogs and other canines. The video shows raccoon dogs being beaten with sticks and thrown against the ground in an attempt to stun them before being hung from their rear legs and skinned alive. In another film a worker begins to cut the skin and fur from an animal's leg. The animal is still alive breathing and kicking. The free limbs kick and writhe making it difficult for the worker to cut the skin from the animal's body. The worker stamps on the animal's neck and head. One investigator filmed a raccoon dog being skinned alive before being thrown onto a heap of carcasses. After the skinning the animal still had enough strength to lift its bloodied head and stare into the camera. Several local Chinese animal welfare groups have reported these cruel practices as commonplace.\n\nFinnish citizens have had a right to instigate parliamentarian law initiatives since 2012. The first citizens' initiative to gain enough signatures was that instituting a ban on fur farming. Some 70,000 citizens signed the initiative within the required time period in 2013. In a march to Parliament House, Helsinki on 18 June., four to five hundred people appealed to members of parliament to approve the citizens' initiative to ban fur farming. According to animal expert MSc Sesse Koivisto (wife of Ilkka Koivisto ex-director of the zoo Korkeasaari) in Helsingin Sanomat in 2010, fur farming did not provide acceptable conditions for the animals. In order to stop the suffering of animals, she demanded a ban on fur farming in Helsingin Sanomat, as in some other countries. On 19 June 2013, the Finnish Parliament rejected the first citizens' initiative to ban fur farming. A positive development in the politics of Finland was that the initiative was taken in the Parliament for public voting.\n\nIn Finland in August 2016, there were about 950 active fur farms. The breeding of fur-animals has had a long tradition in Finland, having been professionally conducted since the 1920s. Up to 90% of the fur-farming community is situated in the rural areas of Ostrobothnia and employs four to six thousand people. Today, fur farming is strictly regulated by law. The Finnish Furbreeders Association has developed its own national program of certification and animal health welfare that is tied to the ISO 9001 standard and monitored by the Norske Veritas. The fur animals are housed in shelter buildings or halls, where each animal has a specific place marked with a kit card. Shelter buildings are suitable for all fur animals, but halls are only used in mink farming.\n\nEstonian citizens have a partial right to submit initiatives with at least 1000 signatures to the parliament since 2014. They do not directly go to the parliamentary hall but go through a process of review in a subject commission. On November 21, 2014, the Estonian animal advocacy organization Loomus submitted a petition to ban fur farming in the country with a 10-year transition period with 10 000 signatures to the parliament. This was preceded by secretly filmed anonymous documentary footage being aired both online via YouTube and on Estonian National Television depicting the conditions of the animals in 2012 (aired 2013) and 2014. The Estonian animal advocacy organization Loomus issued a comment after the airings of Estonian Public Broadcasting outlining the documented disregard animal welfare regulations and pointing out the numerous injuries of animals that were documented.\n\nThe petition has since been under review in the commission of agricultural affairs. The commission procured a study on the economic significance of the industry from the Estonian University of Life Sciences published in 2016, which did not state the exact number of farms in existence but did outline that the mink and fox farms employed 74 full-time workers in 2014, with the majority concentrated in the largest factory in the Baltic States, in Karjaküla, near Tallinn. It also reported the chinchilla farms employed 20.5 full-time workers in 2014. The activists have voiced their concern about the bias inherent in the study, which according to them by and large ignored ethical and environmental arguments, as a number of the experts in the study panel were found to have direct links to and vested interests in the fur industry. The commission is expected to formulate their opinion and vote whether the petition would move on to a law drafting phase and public discussion in the full quorum of the parliament in the fall of 2016.\n\nOn August 22, 2016, activists launched an additional international petition inviting the Estonian Parliament to ban fur farming in the country at change.org.\n\nIn 2014, for the first time in Canadian history, a Quebec fur farmer by the name of Jean-Luc Rodier was charged with animal cruelty following an investigation by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (S.P.C.A.). Fox and mink at the fur farm were seized by animal welfare organizations and some were in such poor condition that they had to be euthanized. Following the S.P.C.A. investigation, this Quebec Fur Farm was raided by anonymous activists who set free thousands of animals.\n\nVideo footage taken at Fur Farms in 2014 in British Columbia by the A.P.F.A. was described by the S.P.C.A. as \"inherently inhumane\". Animal rights activists in the city of Vancouver have been using legal and illegal actions to protest selling fur such as vandalism, home demonstrations of fur shop owners, and organizing public protests.\n\nCanadian fur farms in the Province of Ontario have been repeatedly targeted by an underground group called Animal Liberation Front (ALF). Thousands of mink were freed from farms across the province during 2013 and 2015. The mink breeders association of Ontario responded by offering a hundred thousand dollar bounty leading to a conviction of the persons responsible. Undercover footage was also released by the ALF in 2015 of several Ontario area mink farms, showcasing injured animals and mink cages covered in feces and maggots. Animal rights organizations across the province have taken a wide array of actions to stop the fur trade, such as public protests and disruptions of fur fashion shows.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "685186", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=685186", "title": "Germany Must Perish!", "text": "Germany Must Perish!\n\nGermany Must Perish! is a 104-page book written by Theodore Newman Kaufman, which he self-published in 1941 in the United States. The book advocated genocide through the sterilization of all Germans and the territorial dismemberment of Germany, believing that this would achieve world peace. Kaufman founded the Argyle Press in Newark, New Jersey, United States, in order to publish this book. He was the sole proprietor of the Argyle Press and it is not known to have published any other works.\n\nThe Nazi Party used the book, written by a Jewish author, to support their argument that Jews were plotting against their country.\n\nThough written and self-published by a non-notable author, the book received considerable attention. \"Time\" magazine published a review in its 24 March issue that compared the book to Jonathan Swift's 1729 satirical essay \"A Modest Proposal\", which proposed reducing the population pressure in Ireland by the cannibalistic consumption of poor Irish children. However, the \"Time\" essay recognized that Kaufman's work was not satirical; it described the book as the \"enshrinement of a single sensational idea\". \"Since Germans are the perennial disturbers of the world's peace, says the book, they must be dealt with like any homicidal criminals. But it is unnecessary to put the whole German nation to the sword. It is more humane to sterilize them.\"\n\nAccording to one study, reviews in the United States \"reflected an odd combination of straight reporting and skepticism\". Kaufman's second and more moderate pamphlet, \"No More German Wars\" published in 1942, was ignored both in the U.S. and in Germany.\n\nAn advertisement in \"The New York Times\" stated that the book was released to the public on March 1, 1941. Kaufman also promoted the book by mailing a miniature black cardboard coffin with a hinged lid to reviewers. Inside the coffin was a card proclaiming, \"Read GERMANY MUST PERISH! Tomorrow you will receive your copy.\"\n\nThe book's dust jacket contained excerpts from reviews of the book. One blurb read: \"A Plan For Permanent Peace Among Civilized Nations! -- New York Times.\"\n\nIn 1945, a Jewish journalist wrote an article claiming that the book was \"little more than self-indulgence in dire vituperation by a man who sees Germany as the sole cause of the world's woes\".\n\nKaufman advocated the mass extermination through forced sterilization of the German people and the territorial dismemberment of Germany after an Allied victory in World War II.\n\nKaufman summarized \"Germany Must Perish!\" in advertisements in the \"New York Times\" and \"New York Post\" as: \"A dynamic volume outlining a plan for the extinction of Germany and containing a map showing possible dissection and apportionment of its territory.\" In an interview carried in the September 26, 1941, issue of \"The Canadian Jewish Chronicle\", Kaufman defended his plan for the \"sterilization of all Germans\":\n\nKaufman was a Manhattan-born Jew and his advocacy of genocide attracted great attention in Germany. The book was denounced as an \"orgy of Jewish hatred\" and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's polemical anti-German agitation was seen as having inspired it. American journalist Howard K. Smith was in Germany when \"Germany Must Perish!\" became known. He wrote:\nIn September 1941, Julius Streicher published an essay in \"Der Sturmer\" that called Kaufman's book \"the crazy thinking of [an] insane Jewish brain\". He quoted Kaufman at length and then commented: \"By destroying the German people, the Jew wants to stop up the spring from which, since the beginning, the world has always found its creative blood, the source of all that is beautiful, good and noble.\" Joseph Goebbels also gave a radio address from Berlin warning Germans of \"plans 'for sterilization of our entire population under 60 years' of age\". These concerns were echoed by Adolf Hitler himself after the US entered World War II; he claimed mass sterilization of German male youth was a \"primary\" American goal.\n\nWhen the Jews of Hanover were evicted on September 8, 1941, the local authorities cited Kaufman's book as one of the reasons. Kaufman responded:\nThe book appeared in many pieces of National Socialist propaganda. The \"Parole der Woche\" weekly wall newspaper included it as evidence that the Allies' war aims included the destruction of Germany. The pamphlet \"The War Goal of World Plutocracy\" detailed the contents of the book, although with some omissions from the text that it quoted. It was used in 1944 in a pamphlet, \"Never!\", which described Kaufman's importance:\nAt his Nuremberg trial Julius Streicher cited Kaufman's book in his defense, claiming his anger at Jews was prompted by \"Germany Must Perish!\". The German philosopher and historian Ernst Nolte argues that the German reaction to \"Germany Must Perish!\" supports his contention that World War II was a genuine response to German fears of a worldwide Jewish plot.\n\n\n\n\n"}

To strengthen the local tourism, already existing archaeological parks or trails will be revitalised. New visitor programs in form of digital and analogous tools will be developed and implemented in 9 micro-regions. The micro-regions are: Großklein and Strettweg (Austria), Jalžabet and Kaptol (Croatia), Poštela and Dolenjske Toplice (Slovenia) and Százhalombatta, Süttő and Sopron (Hungary).\n\nThe project partners and associated partners in Austria, Croatia, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia are: \n\nOn the 31st of January 2018 the European Year of Cultural Heritage was officially launched by the European Commission and the Iron-Age-Danube project was granted the honor to use the EYCH 2018 logo.\n\nIn June 2018 the Iron-Age-Danube Project was selected by an Independent Jury as one of 21 finalists for the RegioStars Awards in the 2018 edition.

In all sorts of texts, such as laudatory poems, chronicles, and travelogues, writers have interpreted the how and why of certain circumstances. \n\nThese texts are important for the knowledge of Javanese perspectives on the past. Scholars of Javanese history have paid much attention to theoretical questions, aiming at a balanced evaluation of Javanese historiography next to Western historiography. In doing so they focused on Old and Modern Javanese sources, drawing both on written sources and archaeological and epigraphic material. The debate continues up to the present.\n\"Babads\" as a genre belong to the traditional literature. A characteristic of this kind of literature is that it is written in metrical form and is governed by a set of strict conventions. In traditional Javanese society, prose (\"gancaran\") was not considered to be \"belles letters\" but was considered to be merely sets of notes or \"aide-mémoires\". \n\nThis approach reflected the way in which literature was presented: text was not usually read in silence but, rather, was recited or sung to an audience. Every metre had its own particular melody or melodies to which it was sung, in harmony with the contents of the story.\n\nThe word \"babad\" means 'a story about past events', 'text on the clearing of (the land...)', i.e. 'story about the origin of this or that settlement'.\n\nThe \"Babad Basuki\" relates the clearing of the jungle and founding of a new settlement in Besuki (East Java), while the \"Babad Dipanegara\" relates the events connected with the insurrection of Diponegoro.\n\nKakawin are long epic poems in a defined metre inherited from Sanskrit poetic forms. Kidung are epic poems in Javanese metres.\n\n"}

This area was known as Jeolla Province during the Joseon era.\n\nLike the Chungcheong dialect, the Jeolla dialect is considered non-standard. Perhaps the most obvious difference comes from common verb endings. In place of the usual \"-seumnida\" (습니다 ) or \"-seyo\" (세요 ) endings, a southern Jeolla person will use \"-rau\" (라우 ) or \"-jirau\" (지라우 ) appended to the verb. For a causative verb ending, expressed in standard language with a \"-nikka\" (니까 ) ending, Jeolla people use \"-ngkkei\" (응게 ), so the past tense of the verb \"did\" (\"because someone did it\"), \"haesseunikka\" (했으니까 ), becomes \"haesseungkke\" (했승게 ). A similar sound is used for the quotative ending, \"somebody said...\". The usual verb endings are \"-dago\" (다고 ) and \"-rago\" (라고 ). Jeolla dialect prefers \"-dangkke\" (당게 ).\n\nRegarding pronunciation differences, there is often a tendency to pronounce only the second vowel in a diphthong. For example, the verb ending that indicates \"since\", \"-neundae\", becomes \"-neundi\" (는디). The name of the large city of Gwangju (광주) becomes \"Gangju\" (강주), and the verb 'to not have, to be absent', \"eopda\" 없다, becomes very close to \"upda\" (웂다). There are some words that are unique to the dialect as well: \"utjeseo\" (웆제서) for \"why\", \"sibang\" (시방) for \"now\", and \"dwitgan\" (뒷간) for \"outhouse\". Jeolla dialect speakers have a tendency to end their sentences with \"-ing\", (잉) especially when asking a favor. This can be compared to the word \"eh,\" as used by some Canadians.\n\nPansori texts are written in the Jeolla dialect.\n"}

Taking inspiration from internationally renowned book reviews such as \"The Times Literary Supplement\" and \"The New York Review of Books\", \"L'Indice\" offers its readers reviews of books and the arts (each issue contains up to a hundred book reviews), and essays on current events and cultural topics starting from the most significant literary and intellectual production in Italian.\n\nThe history of \"L'Indice\" begins in October 1984, with the literary critic words about what a book review is expected to achieve: «The essential is that the first moment, that is the description of a book’s contents, shall have the centrality it deserves. Connivance to the reader should not be established ... on the basis of specialistic interest nor by formal flatteries; contents only can ground it ... The essential is that the reader should get from the description of contents a clear idea of what the book is and of the reasons of its importance, those which have induced us to prefer it to others».\n\nIn its twenty-eight years of existence, \"L'Indice\" has always remained faithful to this program. It has documented the Italian book production through reviews and notices, along with surveys, columns, interviews and articles of different sorts. Each of its editors has left his own mark on the review: (1984–90) and Cesare Cases (1990–1994) have contributed to specify the original project, whose recognizable physiognomy is indissolubly associated with portraits and graphics, as well as with drawings. (1994–1999) brought special attention to the relationship between cinema and literature/essays. Under (2000–2001) guidance, \"L'Indice\" inaugurated a new column, \"Segnali\" (Signals), focusing on cultural and political changes, as well as knotty issues in the society we live in. (2001-) has enriched \"L'Indice\" with “Villaggio globale” (Global Village), hosting correspondents who write about books production in Europe and worldwide.\n\nMany distinguished Italian academics and intellectuals belong to the history of \"L’Indice\": from those who gathered around Gian Giacomo Migone in 1984 (Piergiorgio Battaggia, Gian Luigi Beccaria, Riccardo Bellofiore, Mariolina Bertini, Eliana Bouchard, Loris Campetti, Cesare Cases, Enrico Castelnuovo, Gianfranco Corsini, Lidia De Federicis, Aldo Fasolo, Franco Ferraresi, Delia Frigessi, Luciano Gallino, Claudio Gorlier, Filippo Maone, Diego Marconi, Franco Marenco, Cesare Pianciola, Tullio Regge, Marco Revelli, Fabrizio Rondolino, Gianni Rondolino, Franco Rositi, Lore Terracini, Gian Luigi Vaccarino), to renowned contributors who have expressly written for the review, such as, among others, Norberto Bobbio, Franco Fortini, Aldo Natoli, Cesare Garboli, Claudio Magris, Vittorio Foa, Carlo Dionisotti, Salvatore Settis, Cesare De Seta, Sebastiano Timpanaro, Edoardo Sanguineti, Maria Corti, Cesare Segre, Alessandro Galante Garrone, Stefano Rodotà, Francesco Orlando, Carlo Ginzburg, Giulio Angioni, Paolo Nori, Enzo Collotti, Adriano Prosperi, Marcello De Cecco, Massimo D'Alema, Luciana Castellina.\n\nThe Editorial Board includes Enrico Alleva, Arnaldo Bagnasco, Andrea Bajani, Elisabetta Bartuli, Gian Luigi Beccaria, Mariolina Bertini (vicedirettore), Cristina Bianchetti, Bruno Bongiovanni, Guido Bonino, Giovanni Borgognone, Eliana Bouchard, Loris Campetti, Andrea Casalegno, Enrico Castelnuovo, Guido Castelnuovo, Alberto Cavaglion, Mario Cedrini, Anna Chiarloni, Sergio Chiarloni, Marina Colonna, Alberto Conte, Sara Cortellazzo, Piero Cresto-Dina, Lidia De Federicis, Piero de Gennaro, Giuseppe Dematteis, Tana De Zulueta, Michela di Macco, Aldo Fasolo (vicedirettore), Giovanni Filoramo, Delia Frigessi, Anna Elisabetta Galeotti, Gian Franco Gianotti, Claudio Gorlier, Davide Lovisolo, Giorgio Luzzi, Danilo Manera, Diego Marconi, Franco Marenco, Walter Meliga, Gian Giacomo Migone, Anna Nadotti, Alberto Papuzzi, Franco Pezzini, Cesare Pianciola, Telmo Pievani, Pierluigi Politi, Nicola Prinetti, Luca Rastello, Tullio Regge, Marco Revelli, Alberto Rizzuti, Gianni Rondolino, Franco Rositi, Lino Sau, Domenico Scarpa, Rocco Sciarrone, Giuseppe Sergi, Stefania Stafutti, Ferdinando Taviani, Mario Tozzi, Gian Luigi Vaccarino, Massimo Vallerani, Maurizio Vaudagna, Anna Viacava, Paolo Vineis, Gustavo Zagrebelsky.\n\nAlong with reviews and notices, which make up the central part of the review, \"L'Indice\" includes a section devoted to cultural current events (“Segnali”) and a series of columns: “Editoria”, on editorial current events; “Villaggio globale”, on book production in Europe and worldwide; “Babele”, about semantic proliferation; “Il libro del mese” (The Book of the Month), a thorough examination of a recently published book; “Effetto film” (Movie Effect, since 1996), on cinematographic works; “Recitar cantando”, on opera events; “Camminar guardando”, on art exhibitions and current events.\n\nIn the course of time, \"L'Indice\" has published a series of special issues on themes of particular interest, hosting interventions by eminent experts and comprehensive bibliographies. Among topics covered one could mention as examples literary translation; the role China has come to play in Italy’s publishing; globalization; protection of cultural heritage; the Italian “Southern question”. Moreover, \"L'Indice\" publishes (since 2008) a quarterly supplement, “L’Indice della scuola”, entirely devoted to the issues of education and learning in Italy, from elementary to university education; and “L’Indice dell’arte” (in its September issue), devoted to arts.\n\nIn 2004 \"L'Indice\" produced a cd-rom (\"L'Indice dei libri del mese 1984-2004\") including all articles published in the first twenty years of the review.\n\nIn 2007, \"L'Indice\" published a volume entitled “La cultura italiana tra autonomia e potere” (“The Italian Culture between Autonomy and Power”), the proceedings of a conference on the twenty years of the review held at the University of Turin (October 4, 2005).\n\nIn 2008, \"L'Indice\" published a special issue on Cesare Cases.\n\nPreviews of each issue of \"L'Indice\" are available at the review’s website. \"L'Indice\" has recently launched its blog, with daily columns by contributors to the review.\n\nSince 1985, \"L'Indice\" has promoted the annual Literary Award \"Italo Calvino\" for unpublished works of fiction.\n\nIt annually organizes public debates within the Turin International Book Fair.\n\nIt monthly organizes, in collaboration with Fnac, \"L'Indice puntato. Un mercoledì da lettori\", a public conference and debate centered on the \"Libro del mese\" (The Book of the Month).\n\nIn 1989, Gian Giacomo Migone, then editor of \"L'Indice\", and Pierre Bourdieu launched the idea of a European literary and cultural journal to be published with identical contents in several European countries. Starting from apparently national, country-specific interventions, the journal aimed at emphasizing the inherent unity of the European culture in a critical historical moment of the integration process, addressing specialists and the wider public at the same time. Along with \"L'Indice\", \"The Times Literary Supplement\", the \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\", \"Le Monde\" and \"El País\" sponsored the project. A 24-pages quarterly multinational literary journal called “Liber. Revue européenne des livres” (“Liber. European Review of Books”) – deliberately playing upon the ambiguity intrinsic to the Latin root, which means both “book” and “free” – was therefore published in the biennium 1989-90 (its first issue was presented at the Frankfurt Book Fair of October 1989), with a combined circulation of over one million. The editor was Pierre Bourdieu. Jeremy Treglown (then editor of \"The Times Literary Supplement\"), Frank Schirrmarcher (\"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\") and Thomas Ferenczi (\"Le Monde\") joined Migone and Bourdieu in the editorial board. After five editions, “Liber” became a supplement of Bourdieu’s publication \"Actes de la recherche en sciences sociales\".\n\nIn 2009, \"L'Indice\" was awarded the International Literary Prize .\n\n\n"}

{"id": "299788", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=299788", "title": "Nianfo", "text": "Nianfo\n\nNianfo (, Japanese: , , ) is a term commonly seen in Pure Land Buddhism. In the context of Pure Land practice, it generally refers to the repetition of the name of Amitābha. It is a translation of Sanskrit \"\" (or, \"recollection of the Buddha\").\n\nAlthough the Sanskrit phrase used in India is not mentioned originally in the bodies of the two main Pure Land sutras, it appears in the opening of the extant Sanskrit Infinite Life Sutra as the following:\n\nThe apostrophe and omission of the first \"A\" in \"Amitābha\" comes from normal Sanskrit sandhi transformation, and implies that the first \"A\" is implied and spoken more quickly. A more accessible rendering might be:\n\nThe phrase literally means \"Homage to Infinite Light\". The Sanskrit pronunciation is the following:\n\nAs the practice of nianfo spread from India to various other regions, the original pronunciation changed to fit various native languages.\n\nIn China, the practice of nianfo was codified with the establishment of the separate Pure Land school of Buddhism. The most common form of this is the six syllable nianfo; some shorten it into Ēmítuófó/Āmítuófó. In the Japanese Jodo Shinshu sect, it is often shortened to \"na man da bu\".\n\nIn the Jodo Shinshu tradition in Japan, variant forms of the nianfo have been used since its inception. The founder, Shinran, used a 9-character in the Shoshinge and the \"Sanamidabutsuge\" (讃阿弥陀佛偈) hymns:\n\nFurther, the \"restorer\" of Jodo Shinshu, Rennyo, frequently inscribed the nianfo for followers using a 10-character ( :\n\nThe latter was originally popularized by Shinran's descendant (and Rennyo's ancestor), Kakunyo, but its use was greatly expanded by Rennyo.\n\nRegarding Pure Land practice in Indian Buddhism, Hajime Nakamura writes that as described in the Pure Land sūtras from India, Mindfulness of the Buddha (Skt. \"buddhānusmṛti\", Ch. \"nianfo\") is the essential practice. These forms of mindfulness are essentially methods of meditating upon Amitābha Buddha.\n\nIn the \"Śūraṅgama Sūtra\", the bodhisattva Mahāsthāmaprāpta tells how the practice of nianfo enabled him to obtain samādhi.\n\nIn Chinese Buddhism, the nianfo is specifically taken as a subject of meditation and is often practiced while counting with Buddhist prayer beads.\n\nIn China, Pure Land and Chan Buddhism merged entirely by the Yuan dynasty. The modern Chan revitaliser Nan Huai-Chin taught that the nianfo is to be chanted slowly and the mind emptied out after each repetition. When idle thoughts arise, the nianfo is repeated again to clear them. With constant practice, the mind progressively empties and the meditator attains samādhi.\n\nIn most Pure Land traditions, mindfully chanting of the name of Amitābha is viewed as allowing one to obtain birth in Amitābha's pure land, Sukhāvatī. It is felt that this act would help to negate vast stores of negative karma that might hinder one's pursuit of buddhahood. Sukhāvatī is a place of refuge where one can become enlightened without being distracted by the sufferings of our existence.\n\nVarious Pure Land schools in Japan have different interpretations of the nianfo, often based on faith in Amitābha rather than on meditation. In Jōdo Shinshū, the nianfo is reinterpreted as an expression of gratitude to Amitābha. The idea behind this is that rebirth into Sukhāvatī is assured the moment one first has faith in Amitābha.\n\nAndrew Skilton looks to an intermingling of Mahāyāna teachings with Buddhist meditation schools in Kashmir for the rise of Mahāyāna practices related to \"buddhānusmṛti\":\n\nThe earliest dated sutra describing the nianfo is the \"Pratyutpanna Samādhi Sūtra\" (first century BCE), which is thought to have originated in ancient kingdom of Gandhāra. This sutra does not enumerate any vows of Amitābha or the qualities of his pure land, Sukhāvatī, but rather briefly describes the repetition of the name of Amitābha as a means to enter his realm through meditation.\n\nBoth the \"Infinite Life Sutra\" and the \"Amitābha Sūtra\" subsequently included instructions for practicing buddhānusmṛti in this manner. However, it has not been determined which sūtra was composed first, and to what degree the practice of buddhānusmṛti had already been popularized in India. Buddhānusmṛti directed at other buddhas and bodhisattvas is also advocated in sūtras from this period, for figures such as Akṣobhya and Avalokiteśvara. The practice of buddhānusmṛti for Amitābha became very popular in India. With translations of the aforementioned sūtras as well as instruction from Indian monks, the practice rapidly spread to East Asia.\n\nThe term nembutsu-ban is applied to the event in Kyoto, Japan in 1207 where Hōnen and his followers were banned from the city and forced into exile. This occurred when the leaders of older schools of Buddhism persuaded the civil authorities to prohibit the newer practices including the recitation of \"Namu Amida Butsu\". The ban was lifted in 1211.\n\nThích Quảng Đức, a Vietnamese Mahāyāna monk who famously burned himself to death in an act of protest, said the nianfo as his last words immediately before death. He sat in the lotus position, rotated a string of wooden prayer beads, and recited the words \"Nam Mô A Di Đà Phật\" before striking the match and dropping it on himself.\n\n\n"}

Running for 13 issues (cover-dated Aug. 1967 to May 1969), it included among its contributors such notable writers and artists as Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Gene Colan, Bill Everett, John and Marie Severin, and Roy Thomas. With issue #9, it became a 68-page, 25¢ \"giant\", relative to the typical 12¢ comics of the times. In 2017, a 14th issue was released.\n\nIts mascot, Forbush Man, introduced in the first issue, was a superhero wannabe with no superpowers and a costume of red long johns emblazoned with the letter \"F\" and a cooking pot, with eye-holes, covering his never-revealed head. His secret identity was eventually revealed in issue #5 (Dec. 1967) as Irving Forbush, Marvel's fictitious office gofer.\n\nMarvel Comics' superhero-satire comic book \"Not Brand Echh\" ran an initial 13 issues (cover-dated Aug. 1967 - May 1969), with a 14th issue published in 2017.\n\nThe series title was a play on an advertising convention of the time, in which a competitor's product was not referred to by name, but simply as \"Brand X\"; DC was sometimes playfully called \"Brand Echh\" in Marvel \"Bullpen Bulletins\" and letters pages, hence this comic was \"Not Brand Echh\". The copyrighted title of the comic in its postal indicia was \"Brand Echh\" for its first four issues, and afterward \"Not Brand Echh\", the trademarked cover title from the start.\n\nTypical stories and name transpositions included Ironed Man (Iron Man) vs. Magnut, Robot Biter (Gold Key Comics' Magnus, Robot Fighter); \"Best Side Story\", with Dr. Deranged (Dr. Strange) in a \"West Side Story\" pastiche; \"The Origin of...Stuporman\", a Superman takeoff recalling Wally Wood's influential \"Superduperman\" in \"Mad\" #4 (May 1952); the Ecchs-Men in \"If Magneat-O Should Clobber Us\", parodying not only the X-Men and Magneto, but also the high melodrama of 1960s Marvel titles; and Marvel characters visually standing-in for the baseball-player protagonists of the otherwise faithfully rendered famous poem \"Casey at the Bat\". Events took place in the \"Marble Universe\", a play on the Marvel Universe. \n\nIn broader topical references, Gary Friedrich, writer of \"Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos\", and cartoonist and Marvel production manager John Verpoorten contributed a Marvel-character version of the Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" record album art. Robert Crumb's album cover art for Big Brother and the Holding Company was parodied by Herb Trimpe. Later issues had parodies of famous films such as \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\" and \"Camelot\" and features about superhero poetry, superhero carnival and \"Rent A Super-Hero\", in which children employed their favorite heroes to help with mundane tasks like family plumbing problems. Warren Publishing editor Bill DuBay drew and co-wrote one story in his only Marvel appearance.

One story, for instance, featured \"Superbman vs. The Fantastical Four\" — the same name as in \"Not Brand Echh\" for a parodistic Fantastic Four. \"Not Brand Echh\" mascot Forbush Man made a cover-featured return appearance in issue #8 (July 1990). Two one-shots, \"Wha...Huh?\" in 2005, and \"Marvel: Now What?!\" in 2013 revisited the concept.\n\nThe \"Official Handbook to the Marvel Universe: Alternate Universes\" (2005) designated the Earth of \"Not Brand Echh\" and \"What The--?!\" as Earth-665.\n\n\"Not Brand Echh\" characters made an appearance in Marvel's \"Nextwave\" series.\nSeveral stories were reprinted in the three-issue Marvel comic \"Crazy!\" (Feb.–June 1973), not to be confused with Marvel's black-and-white magazine \"Crazy Magazine\".\n\nIn the UK, the comic was published in a tabloid-like black-and-white format in the early 1980s and renamed \"Marvel Madhouse\".\n\nIn 2015, Marvel released a collected edition of the series as part of the hardcover Marvel Masterworks line. Reprinted were \"Not Brand Echh\" (1967) #1-13 and humor backup features from \"Daredevil Annual\" #1, \"Fantastic Four Annual\" #5, \"Sgt.

{"id": "3170873", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3170873", "title": "Ruble", "text": "Ruble\n\nThe ruble or rouble (; ) is or was a currency unit of a number of countries in Eastern Europe closely associated with the economy of Russia. Originally, the ruble was the currency unit of Imperial Russia and then the Soviet Union (as the Soviet ruble), and it is currently the currency unit of Russia (as the Russian ruble) and Belarus (as the Belarussian ruble). The Russian ruble is also used in the partially recognised states of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. In the past, several other countries influenced by Russia and the Soviet Union had currency units that were also named rubles. One ruble is divided into 100 kopeks ().\n\nAccording to one version, the word \"ruble\" is derived from the Russian verb рубить (\"rubit\"), \"to cut, to chop, to hack\", as a ruble was considered a cutout piece of a silver grivna. \n\nRubles were parts of the grivna or pieces of silver with notches indicating their weight. Each grivna was divided into four parts; the name \"ruble\" came from the word \"cut\" because the silver rod weighing 1 grivna was split into four parts, which were called rubles.\n\nOthers say the ruble was never part of a grivna but a synonym for it. This is attested in a 13th century Novgorod birch bark manuscript, where both ruble and grivna referred to 204g (6.6 troy ounces) of silver. The casting of these pieces included some sort of cutting (the exact technology is unknown), hence the name from рубить (\"rubit\"). \n\nAnother version of the word's origin is that it comes from the Russian noun рубец (\"rubets\"), the seam that is left around a silver bullions after casting: silver was added to the cast in two steps. Therefore, the word \"ruble\" means \"a cast with a seam\". A popular theory deriving the word ruble from rupee is probably not correct.\n\nThe ruble was the Russian equivalent of the mark, a measurement of weight for silver and gold used in medieval Western Europe. The weight of one \"ruble\" was equal to the weight of one \"grivna\".\n\nIn Russian, a folk name for ruble, \"tselkovyj\" (целко́вый, , wholesome), is known, which is a shortening of the целковый рубль (\"tselkovyj ruble\"), i.e., a wholesome, uncut ruble. This name persists in the Mordvin word for ruble, \"целковой\".\n\nThe word \"kopek\", \"kopeck\", \"copeck\", or \"kopeyka\" (in , \"kopeyka\") is a diminutive form of the Russian \"kop'yo\" (копьё) — a spear. The first kopek coins, minted at Novgorod and Pskov from about 1534 onwards, show a horseman with a spear. From the 1540s onwards the horseman bears a crown, and doubtless the intention was to represent Ivan the Terrible, who was Grand Prince of all Russia until 1547, and Tsar thereafter. Subsequent mintings of the coin, starting in the 18th century, bear instead Saint George striking down a serpent.\n\nSince the monetary reform of 1534, one Russian accounting ruble became equivalent to 100 silver Novgorod denga coins or smaller 200 Muscovite denga coins or even smaller 400 \"polushka\" coins. Exactly the former coin with a rider on it soon became colloquially known as \"kopek\" and was the higher coin until the beginning of the 18th century. Ruble coins as such did not exist till Peter the Great, when in 1704 he reformed the old monetary system and ordered mintage of a 28-gramme silver ruble coin equivalent to 100 new copper kopek coins. Apart from one ruble and one kopek coins other smaller and greater coins existed as well.\n\nBoth the spellings \"ruble\" and \"rouble\" are used in English. The form \"rouble\" is preferred by the Oxford English Dictionary, but the earliest use recorded in English is the now completely obsolete \"robble\". The form \"rouble\" probably derives from the transliteration into French used among the Tsarist aristocracy. There are two main usage tendencies: one is for North American authors to use \"ruble\" and other English speakers to use \"rouble\", while the other is for older sources to use \"rouble\" and more recent ones to use \"ruble\". Neither tendency is absolutely consistent.\n\nThe Russian plurals that may be seen on the actual currency are modified according to Russian grammar. Numbers 1, 21, 31 etc. (but not 11) are followed by nominative singular рубль \"rubl′\", копе́йка \"kopéyka\". Numbers 2–4, 22–24, 32–34 etc. (but not 12-14) will be followed by genitive singular рубля́ \"rublyá\", копе́йки \"kopéyki\". Numbers 5–20, 25–30, 35–40 etc. will be followed by genitive plural рубле́й \"rubléy\", копе́ек \"kopéek\".\n\nIn several languages spoken in Russia and the former Soviet Union, the currency name has no etymological relation with \"ruble\". Especially in Turkic languages or languages influenced by them, the ruble is often known (also officially) as \"som\" or \"sum\" (meaning \"pure\"), or \"manat\" (from Russian \"moneta\", meaning \"coin\"). Soviet banknotes had their value printed in the languages of all 15 republics of the Soviet Union.\n\nFrom the 14th to the 17th centuries the ruble was neither a coin nor a currency but rather a unit of weight. The most used currency was a small silver coin called \"denga\" (pl. \"dengi\"). There were two variants of the denga minted in Novgorod and Moscow. The weight of a denga silver coin was unstable and inflating, but by 1535 one Novgorod denga weighted , the Moscow denga being a half of the Novgorod denga. Thus one \"account ruble\" consisted of 100 Novgorod or 200 Moscow dengi ( of silver). As the Novgorod denga bore the image of a rider with a spear (), it later has become known as \"kopek\". In the 17th century the weight of a kopek coin lowered to , thus one ruble was equal to of silver.\n\nIn 1654–1655 tsar Alexis I tried to carry out a monetary reform and ordered to mint silver one ruble coins from imported joachimsthalers and new kopek coins from copper (old silver kopeks was left in circulation). Although around 1 million of such rubles was made, its lower weight (28–32 grams) against the nominal ruble (48 g) led to counterfeit, speculation and inflation, and after the Copper Riot of 1662 the new monetary system was abandoned in favour of the old one.\n\nIn 1704 Peter the Great finally reformed the old Russian monetary system, ordering the minting of a silver ruble coin equivalent to 100 new copper kopek coins, thus making the Russian ruble the world's first decimal currency.\n\nThe amount of precious metal in a ruble varied over time. In a 1704 currency reform, Peter the Great standardized the ruble to 28 grams of silver. While ruble coins were silver, there were higher denominations minted of gold and platinum. By the end of the 18th century, the ruble was set to 4 zolotnik 21 dolya (almost exactly equal to 18 grams) of pure silver or 27 dolya (almost exactly equal to 1.2 grams) of pure gold, with a ratio of 15:1 for the values of the two metals. In 1828, platinum coins were introduced with 1 ruble equal to 77⅔ dolya (3.451 grams).\n\nOn 17 December 1885, a new standard was adopted which did not change the silver ruble but reduced the gold content to 1.161 grams, pegging the gold ruble to the French franc at a rate of 1 ruble = 4 francs. This rate was revised in 1897 to 1 ruble = 2⅔ francs (0.774 grams gold).\n\nThe ruble was worth about 0.50 USD in 1914.\n\nWith the outbreak of World War I, the gold standard peg was dropped and the ruble fell in value, suffering from hyperinflation in the early 1920s. With the founding of the Soviet Union in 1922, the Russian ruble was replaced by the Soviet ruble. The pre-revolutionary Chervonetz was temporarily brought back into circulation from 1922–1925.\n\nBy the beginning of the 19th century, copper coins were issued for , , 1, 2 and 5 kopeks, with silver 5, 10, 25 and 50 kopeks and 1 ruble and gold 5 although production of the 10 ruble coin ceased in 1806. Silver 20 kopeks were introduced in 1820, followed by copper 10 kopeks minted between 1830 and 1839, and copper 3 kopeks introduced in 1840. Between 1828 and 1845, platinum 3, 6 and 12 rubles were issued. In 1860, silver 15 kopeks were introduced, due to the use of this denomination (equal to 1 złoty) in Poland, whilst, in 1869, gold 3 rubles were introduced. In 1886, a new gold coinage was introduced consisting of 5 and 10 ruble coins. This was followed by another in 1897. In addition to smaller 5 and 10 ruble coins, and 15 ruble coins were issued for a single year, as these were equal in size to the previous 5 and 10 ruble coins. The gold coinage was suspended in 1911, with the other denominations produced until the First World War.\n\nThe Constantine ruble (Russian: , ) is a rare silver coin of the Russian Empire bearing the profile of Constantine, the brother of emperors Alexander I and Nicholas I. Its manufacture was being prepared at the Saint Petersburg Mint during the brief Interregnum of 1825, but it was never minted in numbers, and never circulated in public. Its existence became known in 1857 in foreign publications.\n\nIn 1768, during the reign of Catherine the Great, the Assignation Bank was instituted to issue the government paper money. It opened in Saint Petersburg and in Moscow in 1769.\n\nIn 1769, Assignation rubles were introduced for 25, 50, 75 and 100 rubles, with 5 and 10 rubles added in 1787 and 200 ruble in 1819. The value of the Assignation rubles fell relative to the coins until, in 1839, the relationship was fixed at 1 coin ruble = 3½ assignat rubles. In 1840, the State Commercial Bank issued 3, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 rubles notes, followed by 50 ruble credit notes of the Custody Treasury and State Loan Bank.\n\nIn 1843, the Assignation Bank ceased operations, and \"state credit notes\" (Russian: , ) were introduced in denominations of 1, 3, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 rubles. These circulated, in various types, until the revolution, with 500 rubles notes added in 1898 and 250 and 1000 rubles notes added in 1917. In 1915, two kinds of small change notes were issued. One, issued by the Treasury, consisted of regular style (if small) notes for 1, 2, 3, 5 and 50 kopeks. The other consisted of the designs of stamps printed onto card with text and the imperial eagle printed on the reverse. These were in denominations of 1, 2, 3, 10, 15 and 20 kopeks.\n\nIn 1917, the Provisional Government issued treasury notes for 20 and 40 rubles. These notes are known as \"Kerenski\" or \"Kerensky rubles\". The provisional government also had 25 and 1,000 rubles state credit notes printed in the United States but most were not issued.\n\nThe Soviet ruble replaced the ruble of the Russian Empire. The Soviet ruble (code: SUR) was the currency of the Soviet Union since 1917 until the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. The Soviet ruble was issued by the State Bank of the USSR. The Soviet ruble continued to be used in the 15 Post-Soviet states.\n\nThe Soviet ruble was used until 1992 in Russia (replaced by Russian ruble), Ukraine (replaced by Ukrainian karbovanets), Estonia (replaced by Estonian kroon), Latvia (replaced by Latvian rublis), Lithuania (replaced by Lithuanian talonas), and until 1993 in Belarus (replaced by Belarusian ruble), Georgia (replaced by Georgian lari), Armenia (replaced by Armenian dram), Kazakhstan (replaced by Kazakhstani tenge), Kyrgyzstan (replaced by Kyrgyzstani som), Moldova (replaced by Moldovan cupon), Turkmenistan (replaced by Turkmenistan manat), Uzbekistan (replaced by Uzbekistani so'm), and until 1994 in Azerbaijan (replaced by Azerbaijani manat) and until 1995 in Tajikistan (replaced by Tajikistani ruble).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It premiered in China on Hunan Broadcasting System (HBS) on 10 September 2011.\n\nA pioneer of the time slip genre in Asian television, \"Scarlet Heart\" was a commercial and critical hit, both in China and across Asia. A sequel, \"Scarlet Heart 2\" first aired in China on Zhejiang TV on 22 April 2014.\n\nZhang Xiao (Cecilia Liu), a young woman from the 21st century, suffers a near-fatal accident that sends her back in time to the Qing Dynasty during the Kangxi Emperor's (Damian Lau) reign. She finds herself trapped in the body of one of her previous incarnations: Ma'ertai Ruoxi, the teenage daughter of a Manchu general. In this new timeline, she has an elder sister, Ruolan (Annie Liu), who is a concubine of the Kangxi Emperor's eighth son, Yinsi (Kevin Cheng). Ruoxi initially tries to return to the future, but she soon adjusts to life in this era. She meets some of Kangxi's other sons, including the fourth prince Yinzhen (Nicky Wu), tenth prince Yin'e (Ye Zuxin) who falls in love with her, and fourteenth prince Yinti (Lin Gengxin). She also forges a close friendship with the thirteenth prince, Yinxiang (Yuan Hong).\n\nRuoxi attracts the attention of the emperor with rumors of her brashness and bravery, and manages to charm him with her intelligence and wit. Later, at the imperial palace's \"beauty draft\" (during which concubines and wives are chosen for the princes or the emperor himself), conflicting arrangements are made by Yinsi and his first wife, Gogoro Minghui (Shi Xiaoqun), leading to Ruoxi being drafted into the service of the dowager empress to keep the peace. Ruoxi is given an appointment as a servant to the emperor himself, specifically to prepare and serve tea to him and those he hosts.\n\nDuring Ruoxi's stay in Yinsi's house, Yinsi falls in love with her. She initially rejects him but eventually returns his feelings, and later agrees to marry him if he gives up competing for the succession to the throne. This is because Ruoxi's knowledge of history makes her aware that Yinsi's ambition will ultimately lead to his death in prison after Yinzhen becomes emperor. However, Yinsi refuses to and thus Ruoxi breaks up with him. Before leaving, Ruoxi warns Yinsi of Yinzhen's plans to usurp the throne and came up with solutions for him to prevent being taken down by Yinzhen.\n\nRuoxi then started to get closer to Yinzhen, and their interactions changed her unfavorable opinion of him, and she unwittingly falls in love with him. Meanwhile, Yinsi and his supporters, acting on Ruoxi's advice, frame Yinzhen for plotting against the crown prince Yinreng (Zhang Lei). Yinxiang steps forward to take responsibility and is ultimately sentenced to house arrest. After this incident, Yinsi realizes that Ruoxi is now romantically involved with Yinzhen. Yinreng is deposed after his criminal ways are exposed and is imprisoned for life. Kangxi then begins showing preference for Yinti and offers Ruoxi as a concubine to him. However, Ruoxi boldly defies the emperor's order, and as a penalty, she is demoted to the laundry department.\n\nRuoxi works within the laundry department for a number of years, and is offered some level of protection and special treatment by ways of the princes. Kangxi falls ill during this time, and when Ruoxi is brought back to the emperor's service by Eunuch Wang to prepare pastries and help stimulate Kangxi's appetite, he pardons her and restores her to her former role as his lead tea server.\n\nKangxi eventually dies of his illness, and with military support from Longkodo (Zhao Jialin) and Nian Gengyao (Xing Hanqing), Yinzhen falsely claims that Kangxi named him the successor, effectively staging a coup and taking the throne from Yinti to become the Yongzheng Emperor. Yinzhen then releases Yinxiang from custody and moves Ruoxi into his quarters, eventually consummating their relationship. He does not, however, marry her, as he wants to be able to live with her and see her every day—wives and concubines have their own estates between which the emperor must divide his time. Ruoxi is pleased enough with this arrangement, as she has always been reticent about marriage and enjoys seeing Yinzhen daily as well. Ruoxi's happiness, however, is marred by Yinzhen's paranoia and his ruthless persecution of Yinsi and his followers. She is often caught between the rivaling factions of Yinzhen and Yinsi.\n\nWhen Gogoro Minghui tells Ruoxi that Yinsi acted against Yinzhen years ago because of her advice based on the knowledge of the future, she is shocked, and her despair causes her to miscarry Yinzhen's child and is unable to conceive again. Enraged, Yinzhen blames Yinsi and his wife, issuing an edict forcing them to divorce, which leads her to commit suicide. Ruoxi fears Yinzhen's punitive actions against his brothers and confesses the truth to him and Yinxiang. Yinzhen is stunned when he understands why Yinsi plotted against him and starts treating Ruoxi coldly. Ruoxi is unable to withstand the mental stress and asks Yinti to help her leave the palace. Yinsi knows that Yinzhen will not allow Ruoxi to leave and decides to intervene. He discloses details of his past romance with Ruoxi, and an angered Yinzhen eventually agrees to let Ruoxi and Yinti leave the Forbidden City.\n\nDespite Yinti's excellent care, Ruoxi's emotional anguish deeply affects her health, and she begs him to send a letter to Yinzhen, requesting to see the emperor one last time before she dies. However, a misunderstanding between Yinzhen and Yinti causes the letter to be thrown aside unread. Ruoxi struggles to stay alive, but after three days, she concludes that Yinzhen's absence confirms that his love for her has ended, and she dies. When news of Ruoxi's death reaches Yinzhen, he rushes to Yinti's house, regretting his actions after learning that Ruoxi still loved him.\n\nIn the later years, Yinsi and Yintang (Han Dong) were imprisoned as Yinzhen blames them for everything that happened. Yinxiang went to visit them in prison and hands them poison, which was Ruoxi's request to him before she left the palace. Both Princes commit suicide and end their suffering. Yinxiang dies a few years later, followed shortly by Yinzhen himself, whose 12-year reign as Emperor was the shortest in Qing history. Yinti lives on but does not find another wife. Only Yin'e has a happy ending with his wife (Liu Yuxin) that he grew to love, watching Qianlong Emperor ascend the throne.\n\nBack in 2011, Zhang Xiao regains consciousness in a hospital and is informed that she had been in a coma for weeks. She wonders if her experiences in the past were real or imaginary. After recovering, Zhang researches the Qing Dynasty era, only to find that history remains on its proper course, and there are no records on Ma'ertai Ruoxi. However, she later visits a museum where she recognizes some Qing Dynasty-era artifacts and sees a woman in a Kangxi Emperor portrait that resembles her. Meanwhile, a man who bears a striking resemblance to Yinzhen visits the exhibition and encounters Zhang Xiao but does not recognize her. The show ends with a cliffhanger of the man walking away as Zhang Xiao's tears start to fall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe show's producers have announced that the series will remain mostly faithful to \"Bu Bu Jing Xin\", the novel by Tong Hua on which it is based. However, there are some differences:\n\n\n\n\"\" is a South Korean remake, directed by Kim Kyu-tae. It is the first Korean drama project for Universal Studios and has a budget of $13 million. It began airing on 29 August 2016 for 20 episodes. It received criticisms for its screenplay, direction and performances, but was well received overseas. In China, the series aired at the same time as its Korean broadcast on Youku and Mango TV, also, in Hong Kong on LeTV, and on ONE TV ASIA in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia under the title \"Scarlet Heart\". Due to its simultaneous broadcast and extensive publicity campaign, including a fan-meeting with Kang Ha-neul before the premiere, the drama was well received in Singapore and Malaysia, and has 2.5 billion cumulative views on China's biggest video platform, Youku.\n\n"}

The designation is usually determined by a governmental body, such as a Department of Transportation or a Ministry of Transport.\n\nA tourist highway or holiday route is a road which is marketed as particularly suited for tourists. Tourist highways may be formed when existing roads are promoted with traffic signs and advertising material. Some tourist highways such as the Blue Ridge Parkway are built especially for tourism purposes. Others may be roadways enjoyed by local citizens in areas of unique or exceptional natural beauty. Still others, such as the Lincoln Highway in Illinois are former main roads, only designated as \"scenic\" after most traffic bypasses them. In the United States this type of roadway is commonly termed a scenic highway. In Europe and other countries around the world they are often marked with brown tourist signs with the individual route symbol or name, or both.\n\nIn the United States, a \"scenic route\" may also refer to a type of special route of the U.S. highway system that travels through a particularly beautiful area. These special routes, which boast \"Scenic\" banners are typically longer than the \"parent route\". There is only one route in the country that remains with the official scenic designation: U.S. Route 40 Scenic.\n\nScenic byways in the United States, also include state, National Scenic Byway, National Forest Scenic Byways and Bureau of Land Management Back Country Byways programs which designate roads or routes as scenic byways due to some unique characteristics.\n\nNational Parkways are scenic roads in the National Park System built for recreational driving through scenic or historic areas. Unlike most scenic routes, National Parkways are built with a buffer of park land along both sides of the roadway. They also may have large satellite parks or recreation areas built periodically along their length.\n\nMost National Historic Trails are commemorative motor routes which follow historic pathways.\n\nTheme Routes are special theme-based tours, aimed at providing a visitor or tourist with a better insight on that theme. Being popular in Europe, they can cover anything from an individual city, a wine growing region, Dutch tulip fields, Swiss Mountains, to Norwegian Fjords. Subjects can be architectural, historical, or cultural.\n\nExamples of theme routes: \n\n\n\n"}

It was produced by Daneboe's company Annoying Orange, Inc., alongside management company The Collective and the studios 14th Hour Productions. A preview aired on May 28, 2012, and the official premiere was on June 11, 2012. \n\nThe show ended on March 17, 2014 with two seasons and sixty episodes, with a total of thirty episodes per season. On December 5, 2014, Boedigheimer confirmed publicly the cancellation of the series on Daneboe Exposed #22.\n\nOn April 24, 2015, Boedigheimer claimed that one big cause of the series cancellation was the shutdown of his studio, due to Collective Digital Studio closing their film and television division.\n\nThe show follows the lives of Orange and friends: Pear, Passion Fruit, Midget Apple, Marshmallow, Apple, Grandpa Lemon, and the (sometimes) antagonistic Grapefruit. The show diverges from the YouTube series in that the Fruit Gang live on a Fruit Stand in a supermarket called \"Daneboe's\" (a reference to the creator Dane Boedigheimer) rather than in Dane Boedigheimer's Kitchen.\n\nA reoccurring character from the Annoying Orange YouTube series called Nerville (played by internet personality Toby Turner) now runs the supermarket (mainly as the Janitor), and is the only human who can talk to the fruit (though other people dismiss it as insanity). Another divergence from the Web Series is that there is the same violence, and acts of Knife that kill the characters and Misadventures of the fruit as they face evil zombie vegetables, alien broccoli, various movies and TV Shows parodies and other weird characters as well.\n\n\n\nDaneboe confirmed that he had started producing a TV show based on \"The Annoying Orange\" in April 2010. Boedigheimer finished the script for the first 6 episodes of the show in October of that year. When Boedigheimer began filming the pilot episode of the TV show in February 2011, he discussed with Cartoon Network about airing it on the station, which was picked up in November 18 of that year. The pilot episode had been completed in about 6–7 months.\n\nThere were originally meant to be 6 episodes of the show, but it was eventually bumped up to 15 episodes, then bumped up to a 30 episode first season; the show had been green-lit for another 30 episode second season. The second season premiered on May 16, 2013.\n\nThe show is produced by Boedigheimer, Conrad Vernon and Tom Sheppard, co-executive-produced by Spencer Grove, Kevin Brueck, Robert Jennings and Aaron Massey, and produced with Gary Binkow, Michael Green and Dan Weinstein.\n\nMost of the visual effects, compositing, off-line, on-line, audio, RED Camera footage, graphics, and animation are done at Kappa Studios in Burbank, California. The episodes are completed in six days using the Adobe Creative Suite, with each episode having 47,000 frames over stabilization. 3D software such as Cinema 4D and Lightwave has also been used since the show's second season. Production for Season 2 was completed in October 2013. Despite having a lot of live action, the show is still considered a Cartoon.\n\nA sneak peek was aired on May 28, 2012, and the series officially premiered on June 11, 2012, as Television's #1 Telecast of the Day Among Boys 6–11. In its first two weeks, the show averaged nearly 2.5 million viewers.\n"}

Durant attempts to show the interconnection of their ideas and how one philosopher's ideas informed the next.\n\nThere are nine chapters each focused on one philosopher, and two more chapters each containing briefer profiles of three early 20th century philosophers.\n\nThe book was published in 1926, with a revised second edition released in 1933. The work was preceded by a number of pamphlets in the Little Blue Books series of inexpensive worker education pamphlets. They proved so popular they were assembled into a single book and published in hardcover form by Simon & Schuster in 1926.\n\nPhilosophers profiled are, in order: Plato, Aristotle, Francis Bacon, Baruch Spinoza (with a section on Descartes), Voltaire (with a section on Rousseau), Immanuel Kant (with a section on Hegel), Arthur Schopenhauer, Herbert Spencer, and Friedrich Nietzsche.\n\nThe final two chapters are devoted to European and then American philosophers. Henri Bergson, Benedetto Croce, and Bertrand Russell are covered in the tenth, and George Santayana, William James, and John Dewey are covered in the eleventh.\n\nIn a foreword to the readers in the second edition of the book, Durant expresses his acknowledgement for the criticism that the book received as to how it does not include philosophers from the Asian continent, most notably Confucius, Buddha and Adi Shankara.\n\n\n"}

It is currently housed in the Museo del Prado in Madrid.\n\nThe work was in the Escorial monastery, although it was not mentioned in inventories; later it was moved to the Prado. It is likely that the work was one of the \"Temptations\" sent to the monastery by Philip II of Spain in 1574. This painting has a more serene atmosphere than the triptych with the same theme now in the Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga of Lisbon.\n\nLike all Bosch's works, it cannot be dated with precision, although it is likely from his late production (1500–1516).\n\nIn 2016, the Bosch Research and Conservation project, after five years of researching all known Bosch paintings, announced that they had significant doubts about the attribution of the work to Bosch, instead attributing it to a follower.\n\nSt. Anthony the Abbot is portrayed in meditation, in a sunny landscape near the trunk of a dry tree. St. Anthony is a recurrent figure in Bosch's work, with up to 15 paintings of this subject, all inspired by legends told in the \"Golden Legend\" and in his \"Life\" by Athanasius of Alexandria. He is represented in a setting of solitude and temptation that the saint experienced over twenty years. Although this picture is significantly different from other works by Bosch of St. Anthony, such as the triptych painting of the same name, customary features of the abbot include his dark brown habit with the Greek letter \"tau\" and a pig by his side.\n\nIn contrast to the earlier paintings with St. Anthony, this version of the temptation of St. Anthony finds the abbot calmer from his meditative spirit. His surroundings are peaceful and evoke a sense of calm. The pig lies next to him like a pet. Once demons, the creatures of temptation are now more like goblins and do not disturb the peaceful feeling of the painting.\n\nThis painting, originally framed with a semi-circular arch, was one of Bosch's later works, from sometime after 1490. Philip II of Spain sent it to the Monastery of El Escorial near Madrid. From there the painting came to the Museo del Prado as part of the Royal Collection.\n\n\n"}

They display figures in relief, representing what are presumed to be traditional scenes from Germanic mythology. The plates were designed for production rather than display; by placing thin sheets of foil against the scenes and hammering or otherwise applying pressure from the back, identical images could be quickly mass-produced. The resulting \"pressblech\" foils would be used to decorate rich helmets of the sort found at Vendel, Valsgärde, and Sutton Hoo. Two of the plates may have been made as casts of existing \"pressblech\" foils.\n\nThe plates were discovered in a cairn in early 1870, and are in the collection of the Statens Historiska Museum. They are considered \"famous\", for they contain full scenes from mythology, unlike the fragmentary and degraded scraps of \"pressblech\" foils that are known. The plates have been exhibited internationally, including from 13 May to 26 June 1966, when they were part of the exhibition \"Swedish Gold\" at the British Museum. The plates have been dated to the Vendel Period of the 6th and 7th centuries.\n\nEach plate contains a different mythological design, traditionally labeled, displayed here counterclockwise from the bottom right A to D, as \"man between bears\", \"man with axe holding roped animal\", \"walking warriors carrying spears\" and \"dancing man with horned head-dress and man with spear wearing wolfskin\". The last example is particularly well known for its missing right eye, shown by a laser scanner to have been struck out, likely from the original used to make the mould. This recalls the one-eyed Norse god Odin, said to have given an eye to be allowed to drink from a well whose waters contained wisdom and intelligence, and suggests that the figure on the plate is him. The figures have also been interpreted as representing berserker warriors.\n\n"}

Rather than simply blocking off large portions of the Internet, many schools are utilizing customizable web filtering systems that allow them greater control over which sites are allowed and which are blocked. The Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) requires that U.S. schools have appropriate measures in place to protect students from obscene or harmful online content in order to be eligible for discounts on internet access or internal connections through the Schools and Libraries Program of the Universal Service Fund, commonly known as the E-Rate program. There are a number of commercially available free and paid services that allow schools to meet CIPA requirements and receive the discount.\n\nThe FCC and CIPA do not specify how the filtering needs to be done, so most schools are using a combination of DNS, Browser and Firewall-based filtering.\n\nThe DNS filtering happens at the domain resolution layer of the Internet and does not allow the IP address of an obscene or harmful website to be discovered. There are multiple paid products that perform such work, but many schools are leveraging free solutions to filter non-safe sites.\n\nSome Browser extensions allow parental control to be enabled to restrict non desirable websites categories. For CIPA, those categories include any website with adult-only content.\n\nFirewall-based filtering can be done at the IP layer or using Web proxies to intercept and filter HTTP and HTTPS requests to websites that are not kid safe. This type of solution is difficult to implement as much of the web is moving to HTTPS, so it does not have a high efficiency.\n"}
