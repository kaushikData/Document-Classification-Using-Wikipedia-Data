Ever since its inception, it has been a constant source of inspiration for thousands of music lovers nationwide. APMC has been holding an annual 6-day-music-festival of live performances by the musicians of Pakistan for more than 50 years now.\n\nAt the time of the independence of Pakistan in 1947, Pakistan was so beset with insurmountable social, economic and political problems that fine arts virtually remained neglected. Upto that point in 1947, history's largest migration of people had totally upset the equilibrium of the population not only physically but also emotionally and psychologically. During such times, the arts could not get attention of the people or the government. Pakistani music was neglected more than all else. People only heard Radio Pakistan play some music now and then. The memory of live music concerts lingered in the minds of a few. If lovers of music had nostalgic memories, the musicians were totally frustrated and felt neglected. The height of despair was reflected in the decision of Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan to leave his birthplace Pakistan to go back to India. Soon after, Roshan Ara Begum announced that she was giving up Riyaz (music practice) as no one seemed interested in listening to her music. Her announcement jolted concerned citizens into action. Accepting the challenge, they decided to find ways and means to revive and rejuvenate the seemingly lost but rich and glorious heritage of classical music.\n\nOn 15 September 1959, these concerned citizens met at the famous Coffee House of Lahore and launched a voluntary organization under the title of The All Pakistan Music Conference. The main objective of the APMC was to promote music and musicians by organizing concerts, conferences and festivals. It was decided to hold, as soon as possible, a large event on national level to focus attention on our melodic culture. A festival of folk, light, semi-classical and classical music was announced for 19 February 1960 to 23 February 1960. Spread over five evening and two morning sessions, the festival was an instant success. Musicians from all over the country had participated. People from all walks of life, from all the big cities, Dhaka, Quetta, Karachi and Peshawar, and from towns and villages all over Pakistan attended the concerts in large numbers. This music festival has recently been held at the Alhamra Arts Council in Lahore. The programme started daily at eight in the evening and lasted for five to six hours with the last evening closing a couple of hours after sunrise – a glorious day had dawned. The festival was the first major step which gave new lease of life to music in Pakistan. Followed by monthly concerts, it helped promote this noble art. Simultaneously, the festival helped project musicians. Great masters of whom the general public had not even heard and who were hidden even from the discerning eye were brought to the forefront.\n\nThe late Hayat Ahmad Khan (1921 – 6 February 2005) had been the moving spirit behind All Pakistan Music Conference. He was not only one of its founding members but also a long-serving secretary. \n\nTo encourage the classical musicians/vocalists living in obscurity after the independence of Pakistan in 1947, and particularly influenced by Roshan Ara Begum's probable intention to give up her 'Riyaz' due to the lack of interested listeners in Pakistan, Mr. Hayat along with several music connoisseurs laid the foundation of APMC. This project, he hoped, would rejuvenate interest in classical music in Pakistan. Many well-established artists like Roshan Ara Begum, Akhtari Bai, Rasoolan Bai, Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, Ustad Fateh Ali Khan, Ustad Salamat Ali Khan and Ustad Ghulam Hassan Shaggan have performed at APMC concerts.\n\nOver the years, APMC has also brought forth several amateurs in the field of classical music. Notable names include Fahim Mazhar, Abdur Rauf, Sara Zaman and several others. APMC attracts music luminaries and aspiring artists alike to keep the classical music alive in the country. Not only that, both vocalists and instrumentalists from Afghanistan, Turkey, India, Japan, the United States and Germany, have benefited from the regular musical sittings held at APMC over the past 59 years as of 2017.\n\nThe APMC programmes, held on a monthly basis greatly enrich the cultural ethos of Lahore. Besides these monthly mehfils, APMC also hosts a yearly six-day festival in which musicians/vocalists from all over Pakistan perform till the wee hours of morning. \n\nFew would know that APMC has also been instrumental in promoting classical dance in Pakistan. Classical dance performances of Naheed Siddiqui, Gopi Krishna and Sheema Kermani hosted by the organization stand as evidence.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4076707", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4076707", "title": "Anime-influenced animation", "text": "Anime-influenced animation\n\nAnime-influenced animation, or American anime, refers to non-Japanese works of animation that are similar to or inspired by anime.\n\nAlthough outside Japan, \"anime\" is specifically used to mean animation from Japan or as a Japanese-disseminated animation style often characterized by colorful graphics, vibrant characters and fantastical themes, there is a debate over whether the culturally abstract approach to the word's meaning may open up the possibility of anime produced in countries other than Japan. While some Westerners strictly view anime as a Japanese animation product, some scholars suggest defining anime as specifically or quintessentially Japanese may be related to a new form of orientalism.\n\nGenerally, the term anime refers to a style of animation originating from Japan. As Japanese anime became increasingly popular, Western animation studios began implementing some visual stylizations typical in anime—such as exaggerated facial expressions and \"super deformed\" versions of characters. In particular, \"Batman Beyond\" displayed some characteristics of anime. Particularly for \"Batman Beyond\", some of its production processes were outsourced to Japan.\n\nOne of the first noted attempts from American companies on making anime is in \"The King Kong Show\" in late 60s and early 70s. This animation was the result of a collaboration between Toei Animation from Japan and \"Videocraft\" from America. The result was an animation with an Anime-like visual style and a Japanese Kaiju theme, that incorporated the cartoonish style of the Hanna-Barbera era in American TV animation. Another early example of this might be \"Johnny Cypher in Dimension Zero\".\n\nToei Animation continued this kind of collaborations in the \"Transformers\" TV series, which aired in the 80s. While this animation was actually animated by Toei Animation, the series was produced by and for Americans. Transformers truly showed many influences and elements of anime including story, themes and its style that completely resembled Mecha anime. \nAnother example of this is \"Voltron\"; an American mecha series that reuses the animation from previously released Toei Japanese anime, creating a new story written by American writers. \n\nThis trend continued throughout the 80s with animations like \"Dungeons and Dragons\", again co-produced by Toei Animation. Furthermore, through the 90s, many American shows started to be outsourced to Japanese animators, most notably TMS Entertainment, which animated popular television productions such as \"DuckTales\", \"Animaniacs\" and \"Spider-Man\", most of which visually or thematically were not resembling Japanese anime. \n\nDuring the 90s, some American animations started showing strong influence from anime without having any Japanese artists directly involved in the project. An example of this can be seen in Cartoon Network shows like \"The Powerpuff Girls\" and \"Dexter's Laboratory\" or the Disney Channel show, \"Kim Possible\". \n\nSome other notable example of this anime-influenced shows are \"Batman the Animated Series\" which was actually partially outsourced to Japanese artists, \"Gargoyles\", and more recently \"Teen Titans\" and \"The Batman\".\n\nThe advent of Japanese anime stylizations appearing in Western animation questioned the established meaning of \"anime\". The production on \"The Animatrix\" began when the Wachowskis visited some of the creators of the anime films that had been strong influences on their work, and decided to collaborate with them. \n\n\"\", and its sequel series \"The Legend of Korra\" are other examples of Western anime so heavily influenced by Japanese anime that they started discussions among fans and viewers about what is an Anime and should a non-Japanese animation be called an Anime. \"Avatar\" creators Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino confirmed a particular Japanese anime influence in a magazine interview; that of \"Hayao Miyazaki, especially \"Spirited Away\" and \"Princess Mononoke\"\" as well as \"My Neighbor Totoro\". Other studios from which inspiration was drawn include Studio 4°C, Production I.G, Polygon Pictures and Studio Ghibli.\n\nThe same strong resemblance can be seen in \"\", a reboot of \"Voltron\" franchise, this time completely produced by American artists. Lauren Montgomery and Joaquim Dos Santos, both known for their work on the \"\" and its sequel \"The Legend of Korra\", served as showrunners while fellow crew member Tim Hedrick served as head writer.\n\nThese anime-influenced animations have become defined as \"anime\", in an attempt to classify all Japanese-anime styled works of non-Japanese origin. The web-based series \"RWBY\" is produced using an anime art style and has been declared to be anime. In addition, the series was released in Japan, under the label of \"anime\" per the Japanese definition of the term and referenced as an \"American-made anime\". Netflix declared the company's intention to produce anime. In doing so, the company is offering a more accessible channel for distribution to Western markets. \n\nDefining anime as style has been contentious amongst fans, with John Oppliger stating, \"The insistence on referring to original American art as \"anime\" or \"manga\" robs the work of its cultural identity.\" \nOn the other hand, animations like \"\", its \"sequel\" and \"\" have opened up more debates on whether these works should be called Anime and whether the culturally abstract approach to the word's meaning may open up the possibility of anime produced in countries other than Japan. While some Westerners strictly view anime as a Japanese animation product, some scholars suggest defining anime as specifically or quintessentially Japanese may be related to a new form of orientalism with some fans and critics arguing that the term should be defined as a \"style\" rather than as a national product, which leaves open the possibility of anime being produced in other countries. \n\nJapanese anime has also had an influence on Disney, Pixar and DreamWorks productions. Glen Keane, the animator for successful Disney films such as \"The Little Mermaid\", \"Beauty and the Beast\", \"Aladdin\" and \"Tangled\", has credited Hayao Miyazaki as a \"huge influence\" on \"The Rescuers Down Under\". Pete Docter, director of the popular films \"Up\" and \"Monsters, Inc.\" as well as a co-creator of other Pixar works, has also described anime, specifically Miyazaki, as an influence on his work. Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois described Miyazaki's flight and pacifist themes as an influence for creating \"How to Train Your Dragon\".\n\n\"Stitch!\" is the anime spin-off of Disney's \"Lilo & Stitch\" franchise and the successor to \"\". It debuted in Japan in October 2008. The show features a Japanese girl named Yuna in place of Lilo, and is set on a fictional island in the Ryukyus off the shore of Okinawa instead of Hawaii.\n\nIn the 1980s, there were Japanese-European productions such as \"Ulysses 31\", \"The Mysterious Cities of Gold\", \"Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds\" and \"Sherlock Hound\".\n\nThe Italian animated series \"Winx Club\", one of the most popular and successful shows from Europe, uses a magical girl concept for the main characters, including transformations for each character.\n\nThe French-American international co-production \"W.I.T.C.H.\", another magical girl series, has been noted as having an anime-influenced visual style. First season director Marc Gordon-Bates cited anime such as \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" as design inspiration. The animated series is based on Italian comics of the same name themselves drawn in line with manga conventions, as opposed to the more rounded style traditionally used by publisher and co-producer Disney.\n\nIn 2007, the Canadian anime-style animated short \"Flutter\" became the first work from a non-Asian nation to win the Open Entries Grand Prize at the Tokyo Anime Awards. Another example of anime-influenced animation can be seen in , a flash animation series based on a video game of the same title.\n\nThe producers of the French anime \"Code Lyoko\", one of the most successful works of European anime, explicitly stated in their introductory document that they were: \"Influenced by the poetry and the visual impact of Japanese animation, the series proposes a graphic universe that's particularly original and strong.\" \n\n\"Ōban Star-Racers\" is known as one of the European animations that strongly resemble anime. While the majority of the creative directors and writers were French, the production team moved to Tokyo to collaborate with a Japanese production team. \n\nAnimation such as \"Oban Star-Racers\" and \"Code Lyoko\", like \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\", are examples over which some critics and fans debate about the term anime and whether it is defined as a \"style\" rather than as a national product, which leaves open the possibility of anime being produced in other countries. \n\nA U.A.E.-Filipino produced TV series called \"Torkaizer\" is dubbed as the \"Middle East's First Anime Show\", and is currently in production, which is currently looking for funding.\n\nIn Brazil since the 2000s there have already been countless independent projects for animated series inspired by anime. Projects to adapt popular manga-styled comics like \"Holy Avenger\" and \"Monica Teen\" have already occurred, but were canceled in the course of time. In May 2016, Nickelodeon opened the series \"Os Under-Undergrounds\".\n\n"}

{"id": "6416651", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6416651", "title": "Bahá'í Faith in fiction", "text": "Bahá'í Faith in fiction\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith and related topics have appeared in fiction in multiple forms. The mention of the Bahá'í Faith, prominent members, or even individual believers have appeared in a variety of fictional forms including science fiction, and fantasy, as well as styles of short stories, novelettes, and novels, and even diverse media of the printed word and TV series. A 2005 estimate is of more than 30 references though it could be far more. Out of these near three dozen references, there are perhaps a dozen where there is a significant relationship with the religion, where the Bahá'í Faith is a crucial aspect of the story. The first occurrence known is perhaps Marie von Najmajer wrote a poem dedicated to Tahirih in \"Gurret-úl-Eyn: Ein Bild aus Persiens Neuzeit\" published in 1874. After a series of works covering the events of the Bábí period most of the focus shifted towards Bahá'í specific related connections. Soon Khalil Gibran wrote two books - \"The Prophet\" and \"Jesus, The Son of Man\" - with some second hand evidence for the sustained influence of `Abdu'l-Bahá in these works. In modern times the first known occurrence is of a short story by non-Bahá'í Tom Ligon \"The Devil and the Deep Black Void\", - he also wrote a sequel \"The Gardener\". The next fictional publication, in 1991, which references the Bahá'í Faith may be a short story \"Home Is Where…\" by Bahá'í Maya Kaathryn Bohnhoff,\n\nInitially, and occasionally since, reference has been made to the events and figures of Bábism. As the history of events and coverage of these events in Persia made their way to Europe coverage tended to shift to coverage of the events and figures of the Bahá'í Faith.\n\nAustrian Marie von Najmajer wrote a poem dedicated to Tahireh in \"Gurret-úl-Eyn: Ein Bild aus Persiens Neuzeit\" published in 1874.\n\nJosé Maria de Eça de Queiroz, a well known Portuguese novelist in the 19th century, wrote a novel in 1889 and spends several pages discussing the religion of the Báb and its impact. The material could not all have been derived from the most widespread review of the religion in that day - the work of Arthur de Gobineau. It is speculated Queiroz encountered Bahá'ís in Egypt sometimes from late 1869 to January 1870. Story is set in 1871.\n\nA more extensive reference to the events of the Bábí Faith comes from an obscure writer, A. de Saint-Quentin, in the book \"Un Amour au Pays des Mages\" in 1891 in the background of many events of the Bábí period.\n\nPolish/Russian playwright Isabella Grinevskaya wrote the play \"Báb\" based on the life and events of the founder of the Bábí religion which was performed in St. Petersburg in 1904 and again in 1916/7, and lauded by Leo Tolstoy and other reviewers at the time.\n\nIn 1904 Edith Wharton published a short story with mention of the Bábí Faith.\n\nAs early as 1908 Constance Faunt Le Roy Runcie attempted to publish a romance novel about the Bab and \"Persia's celebrated poetess Zerryn Taj\" while living in Missouri, USA.\n\nThe \"Indianapolis Star\", Indianapolis, Indiana, 28 September 1913, printed a story \"Number Thirteen by the Master of Mysteries\" on pages 64 and 67 of which discusses a note that seemed to indicate the involvement of a Baha'i woman in a situation.\n\nIn 1914 Stephen Leacock published a negative satire \"The Yahi-Bahi Society of Mrs. Resselyer-Brown\" in his Arcadian Adventures with the Idle Rich.\n\nPublished as one of four stories (78 pages out of a total 239), \"The Bab Deception\" in \"The Hidden Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\" by non-Bahá'í William \"Bill\" Paxton (not the actor Bill Paxton) was published in 2000-1. A published synopsis: Set in August, 1896, Sherlock Holmes expounds at great length on his occult beliefs and invites Watson to a (spiritualism based) séance. Lestrade & Macintosh take Holmes & Watson to the home of Sir Randolph Gretzinger, former Ambassador to Persia, who has been murdered along with his servant. Holmes finds a copy of the Bayán in Gretzinger's hand, and he expounds at length on Bábism. Side note: Holmes is presented as having a high regard for the religion and being current on its situation enough to know that \"Abo ol-Baha\" is a political prisoner at that time and knowing full well that the religion would never associate with such a plot having already suffered many martyrs and known to not organize any rebellion and instead maintained a peaceful, unified vision with all mankind. He deduces that the men have been injected with poison (from small wounds in their thumbs), and expounds at length on snake venom. The following day they are summoned to the Diogenes Club, where Mycroft expounds at great length on the politics of petroleum and how this may be the true reason for the murder. After visiting the dead man's widow and urging her to continue his oil negotiations with the Shah of Persia Holmes is visited by representatives of the Bahá'í Faith who fear that the book was planted on the body to implicate them. They expound at length on the assassination of the last Shah and feel an effort is being made to frame them, but Holmes assures them he is well aware of the reputation of the Bahá'ís and believes in their innocence. Holmes & Watson are invited to a séance and Holmes expounds at length on the other guests. At the séance a spirit claiming to be Moriarty hurls a dagger at Holmes. Holmes organizes London Baha'is into a \"Baker Street Baha'i\", including ones in the Russian Embassy, to locate Gretzinger's missing appointment book from which Holmes is able to learn the murderer's name and establish the innocence of the Bahá'ís.\n\nNote that on 1 May 1896 Nasser-al-Din Shah was indeed assassinated and some did blame a Babí but most information points to an anarchist who had been given privileged access to the person of the Shah because of the Shah’s sympathies for his suffering. Most Baha’is have some information of an acknowledged assassination plot by some Babis in 1852 for which Bahá’u’lláh was encarcerated in the Siyah-Chal and eventually found innocent albeit much property had been confiscated or lost to mobs as a result of simply being accused. This is a different incident.\n\n\"The Saddlebag: A Fable for Doubters and Seekers\", a published review of the 2000 publication notes: \n[A] day in the life of nine 19th-century characters traveling between Mecca and Medina in this engaging first novel. Though they come from a wide variety of religious, national and socioeconomic backgrounds, all find themselves in the same caravan when it is beset by a sandstorm and a brutal bandit attack. Each chapter recounts these events from the perspective of its title character, a device Nakhjavani uses skillfully; not only does she avoid the tedium that could result from multiple retellings, but she also turns the bit player in one narrator's story into the complicated hero of another… Nakhjavani shows how God uses their respective religious orientations and the secrets bundled in a saddlebag to reveal life-changing truths to each of them. The novel's Baha'i message is beautifully rendered in these tales of multiple paths leading to one destination.\nNakhjavani has published six books - some academic and at least two fictional, as well as articles and poetry.\n\nAnother is \"La femme qui lisait trop (The Woman Who Reads Too Much)\" in 2007. It tells the story of Táhirih. The writer adopts the revolving points of view, of mother, sister, daughter and wife respectively, to trace the impact of this woman's actions on her contemporaries and read her prophetic insights regarding her times, and perhaps ours too.\n\nNazanin Afshin-Jam is set to play a role as Tahirih in a film by Jack Lenz named \"Mona's Dream\" about the life story of Mona Mahmudnizhad.\n\nSarah Bernhardt the best known French actress of her day asked two of her contemporary authors Catulle Mendès and Henri Antoine Jules-Bois to write a play about Tahirih and the Babis for her to portray on stage.\n\nIn 1911 Brit E. S. Drower wrote \"The Mountain of God\" around the lives of the Bahá'ís in the Haifa-Akka area and is a thinly veiled set of characters showing the influence of `Abdu'l-Bahá in the community.\n\nIn 1912 American Gertrude Atherton wrote a novel \"Julia France and Her Times\" wherein Julia goes to Akka to meet `Abdu'l-Bahá, returns to England and convinces her friend to write a book about the Bahá'ís.\n\nIn 1914 Canadian humorist Stephen Butler Leacock wrote a parody about `Abdu'l-Bahá, \"The Yahi-Bahi Society of Mrs. Resselyer-Brown\", as a chapter in his \"Arcadian Adventures with the Idle Rich\".\n\nA published account notes about Khalil Gibran:\nIt was on April 6, 1943, in her studio-room, upstairs at the front of the house, that Juliet shared with me and a few other guests, these memories of Khalil Gibran…\n\n\"He lived across the street from here,\" said Juliet Thompson, \"at 51 West 10th. He was neither poor nor rich - in between. Worked on an Arab newspaper; free to paint and write. His health was all right in the early years. He was terribly sad in the later years, because of cancer. He died at forty-nine. He knew his life was ending too soon.\n\n\"His drawings were more beautiful than his paintings. These were very misty, lost things - mysterious and lost. Very poetic.\n\n\"A Syrian brought him to see me - can't even remember his name. Khalil always said I was his first friend in New York. We became very, very great friends, and all of his books - \"The Madman\", \"The Forerunner\", \"The Son of Man\", \"The Prophet\" - I heard in manuscript. He always gave me his books. I liked \"The Prophet\" best. I don't believe that there was any connection between `Abdu'l-Bahá and \"The Prophet\". But he told me that he thought of the `Abdu'l-Bahá all through. He said that he was going to write another book with '`Abdu'l-Bahá as the center and all the contemporaries of '`Abdu'l-Bahá speaking. He died before he wrote it. He told me definitely that [the book] \"The Son of Man\" was influenced by '`Abdu'l-Bahá.\"\nIt is known that `Abdu'l-Bahá also sat for portraits at the request of Gibran. From the above it may be concluded that `Abdu'l-Bahá and Gibran knew each other more than in passing, but that `Abdu'l-Bahá made no formal or informal claims or suggestions about Gibran's writing but cooperated whenever asked (as for sitting for the drawings.) So the influence is really at the choice of Gibran - he could as well have chosen and mention any other source of inspiration for his book. It seems he chose `Abdu'l-Bahá. As `Abdu'l-Bahá is one of the of the Bahá'í Faith and these are works of fiction, it is certainly the case that at least two of Gibran's, and his most famous, are properly mentioned here.\n\nThere are many reviews of this famous book, \"The Prophet\". Here's one:\n\nKhalil Gibran's \"The Prophet\" is a book that has touched many people very deeply since its publishing in 1923. It has been translated into more than twenty languages, and the American edition alone has sold more than four million copies. It is considered both by Gibran himself, and by the general public to be his literary masterpiece. \"The Prophet\" is about a man who is leaving a small town called Orphalese where he has made his home for the past twelve years. He has, for that time period, been waiting for a boat to take him back to the land of his youth. We are not told where that land is, only that he has been waiting to return there for twelve years. The entire book occurs on the date of his departure. As he is about to leave, the townsfolk stop him in the town and request that he tell them about certain things. He talks to them about life's lessons and imparts his wisdom to them. He is asked about giving, and he tells the people to give without recognition, because their reward is their own joy. He also talks about things like marriage, work, friendship and also love. He speaks about each, and more, describing the way that people should deal with each issue. This book is an interesting book. It is ninety-three pages of life's lessons set down in writing. These are words to live by, and tell others to live by. This book is certainly a book that everyone should read. Even if people don't agree with some of the beliefs, they should still read the book, if only to get their mind thinking about life, and its many quandaries from a different perspective. This book is not unlike the musings of an aging man imparting his life's lessons to an audience of just about anyone whom he can gather to listen to him. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Its lessons and stories are wise beyond the ages, and still hold up to be as true today as they were when Gibran wrote them in 1923. The lessons enumerated within this pages are lessons that one would hope were followed by the general population, and I know that if more people read this book, then the world as a whole might become a more easily survivable place.\nHere's one of many reviews of \"Jesus, The Son of Man\":\nI find it amazing that he wrote this in the time period he did. It's very prophetic, it seems to be in line with a more modern understanding of Jesus that readers of \"The Course in Miracles\" and \"Marianne Williamson\" are a large part of vocalizing. But even fundamentalists would enjoy this book… being how it is written from the opinion of 80 different points of view, many of which do proclaim him the Son of God. Ultimately, any view can be thoughtfully stimulating because the people of any opinion have personalities and background given that support why they view Jesus with their perspective. The overall impression I received from this beautiful prose is the beauty and message of Jesus, the devotion, admiration, gratitude and love inspired by him, and the grace which he exuded with confident compassion. And whether he was God, man, a combination of both that we all are potentially, or a combination we can only idolize with an envious self-debasing distorted form of humility, this book shows him to be nothing less than relevant to our comprehension.\nCuriously, this is not the only case where someone associated with the Bahá'í Faith wrote a speculative work about things the New Testament is silent on in regards to Jesus. Contemporaries of Gibran Juliet Thompson and Wellesley Tudor Pole wrote books about Jesus. Thompson wrote \"I, Mary Magdalen\" and Tudor Pole wrote \"The Silent Road\", \"A Man Seen Afar\", and \"Writing on the Ground\" as well as some pamphlets though these were written later in the 20th century. Both Thompson and Tudor Pole knew `Abdu'l-Bahá well having interviewed him and worked with him. Thomson wrote a diary, one of the central records of `Abdu'l-Bahá's journeys to the West as well as a portrait and Tudor Pole played a significant role in saving his life in World War I. Indeed, the whole relationship between `Abdu'l-Bahá and Jesus was one `Abdu'l-Bahá was at pains to clarify both to the general public and among early Bahá'ís.\n\nAmong Tom Ligon's many short and medium-sized works (and one award-winning science fact article published in relation to Fusion rocket technology and advocate of Inertial Electrodynamic Fusion), two published in 1986 and 1993, \"The Devil and the Deep Black Void\", and \"The Gardener\" in Analog Magazine, are science fiction stories which are about a Shi'a Muslim terrorist organization in a largely Muslim space-faring civilization where Bahá'ís are space colonists who undertake terraforming on a planet they named \"Mazra'ih\" (though there is brief mention of a United States National Spiritual Assembly back on Earth.) The prequel, \"For a Little Price\" about how terrorists are prevented from crashing a spaceship into the Earth (long predating the events of the September 11, 2001 attacks) was anthologized in 2008 though work began on it in 1986. In the succeeding stories some of the terrorists are instead driven to an unusual world orbiting a neutron star where Bahá'ís live which eventually reveals that civilizations have reached great levels of technology and then mysteriously disappeared. The initial thought is that the civilizations are eradicated by a periodic sterilization the planet undergoes but there is also evidence the civilizations vanished peacefully before the sterilization speculating that civilizations shortly after achieving deep space exploration reach some new level of civilization that doesn't require or sustain material civilization in deep space. The ethical conflict of pacifism, a debatable stance associated with the Bahá'í Faith, in the face of terrorists is worked out. One character, who takes on the name of the historical Bábí who performed an assassination attempt on the life of the Shah of Iran, chooses the path of violence in defense of the population by way (as portrayed) of matching a strength of the Bahá'í Faith in acceptance of science compared to a weakness of Shia Islam of superstition.\n\nThe author comments:\n\"The Devil and the Deep Black Void\" had an interesting genesis. I remember being outraged by reports coming from the far east. Vietnamese \"boat people\" were being preyed on by pirates. I set up a situation where a political upset in a distant colony would make it likely that refugees would be preyed on by pirates. However, the story developed a mind of its own. I realized that, due to the vastness of space, the pirates would be easy to evade. The real threat was the vastness itself. Running away was certain death, and the only hope was returning to face the original problem. That quickly became the focus of the story…\n\nI needed good victims. Recent news had offered an excellent group, the Baha'is, who had been horribly persecuted in Iran. The more I researched them, the more convinced I became that they would make excellent space colonists. My primary reference was an aged primer on the Baha'i Faith by J. E. Esselmont. I did receive some comments from several Baha'is suggesting that I'd portrayed them as too pacifistic, however, I'll stick by my guns on this. My characters, while they believe in public defense, even armies, to preserve peace, are stubborn in living by a passage I found in Esselmont's book in which Baha'u'llah forbids the Baha'is from taking up arms in the defense of the faith. The story is carefully crafted to back them into this corner. Our hero is faced with a loss of his faith, which enables him to take action to save his people, but leaves him in a spiritual dilemma.\n\nI left him in that state for about 7 years, when I had the inspiration for the sequel, \"The Gardener\". Hoping to give Hab, our hero, some hint of faith back, not to mention some much-needed feminine companionship, I devised a story to show what he'd been up to in seven years of self-imposed exile on a remote continent of a planet just begging for life.\"\nAmong the special qualities to Mr. Ligon's contribution to the Bahá'í Faith in fiction is that he is a non-Bahá'í, the stories mentioned explicitly reference the religion, and indeed the religion provides some of the central context for the story line, and possibly the first publication to seriously reference the Bahá'í Faith in fictional literature context. See Persecution of Bahá'ís, Bahá'í Faith in Turkmenistan and Bahá'í Faith in Azerbaijan for cases of Bahá'í responses to violence. The final publication, \"For a Little Price\", is part of an anthology, \"A Mosque Among the Stars\", that is free for download.\n\nBohnhoff has won several awards for her works of fiction and music (especially filk music which is music tied to science fiction or related styles or issues).\n\nBohnhoff's first work to use the Bahá’í Faith as a central aspect of a story may be her 1991 published \"Home Is Where…\" novelette summarized as \"A Baha'i family from the year 2112 is on a time travel research assignment in midwest USA, in 1950.\" There has not been a published review of her work noting the presence of the Bahá'í Faith in her works generally. Her first publication was in 1989 and her publications continue through 2006. Bohnhoff, mother of two and married since 1981 (both true at least as of 2001), has also written many short stories and novelettes, some of them with a significant basis in relation to the Bahá'í Faith, in most of the well known publishing magazines: Analog Magazine, Interzone (magazine), Amazing Stories, Realms of Fantasy, and others. Another example \"The White Dog\" wherein a lady whose shocking albino appearance is eventually warmly loved in accordance with the special relationship pointed out by `Abdu'l-Bahá for a little white dog. Her longest work with a strong presence of the Bahá’í Faith is \"The Meri\" fantasy series which is a trilogy (The Meri published in 1992, Taminy in 1993, and The Crystal Rose in 1995). The series revolves around the period of transition among the people who live on a peninsula. The chapters are headed with quotes from scripture presented as those of the religion of the people but many are in fact quotes from Bahá'í scripture, while a few are from the Bible. The first and second book also carry an acknowledgement of Bahá'u'lláh, a Local Spiritual Assembly and Bahá'í community. The plot involves a progression on the understanding of a people in relation to the role and position of women. Unknown to the people of the story, women have always been instrumental to their religion as agents of God and a chosen few have always acted as the personification of the Spirit of God, or \"Meri\". The first book focuses on a young girl destined to take on that role. While similar to other stories of the triumph of women it has several unique qualities most particularly a central male character being her benefactor and teacher and not an obstacle she has to overcome. The second book focuses on the return of the prior \"Meri\" who takes it as her mission to promulgate the new paradigm as the head of the religion. The third book focuses on her transition to being a head of state but wrestling with several of the same issues from among as well as beyond her people. Another novel she has written called The Spirit Gate has many of the same features but is written in a different context - a fantasy work set in a historical time and place of roughly 1000AD in the area today of Poland and Ukraine where two forms of Christianity and Islam met the pagan older religion. Bahá’í themes, especially in the respect granted other religions, are largely identified with the older religion, however the names of some of the central figures of the religion appear near the end without strongly hinting at any spiritual prominence (names of an ambassador and Caliph, not simply religious figures.)\n\nAmong Bohnhoff's unique contributions to the Bahá'í Faith in fiction is that she is a Bahá'í who has had more than three dozen works published in many major and some minor publishing venues and she has written at least 6 full-length novels of her own - four with strong Bahá'í references though mentioning something in relation to the religion in the others. In combination she has probably subtlety or directly presented themes of the Bahá'í Faith to the widest audience in literature. An anthology of many of her stories was published as \"I Loved Thy Creation\" which is available for download for free.\n\nBest selling Chilean author Isabel Allende published this novel in 1991. The main character, Greg Reeves, engages in a search for meaning and identity. His mother is a Baha'i. She is portrayed in a somewhat negative light.\n\nBahá'í Joseph Sheppherd uses his wide experience living in many countries and professional knowledge as an anthropologist and archaeologist to write an embracing story about the adventures and discoveries of spiritual leaders bound to an island off Africa. The center pivotal periods of the story revolve around two generations of researchers: an archaeologist and his anthropologist daughter. Each in turn visits the same African island, but make vastly different discoveries as the story travels in four different time periods: humanity's distant past, near past, near future, and far future. Published in 1997 the near past and future are near enough to have their relative positions significantly altered - the 1970s for the first and the 2000s for the second, roughly now. This book is over 500 pages long and covers a wide range of topics in careful detail from the practicalities of stone axe making, through archeological digs in tyrannical third world countries, spiritual values expressed among aboriginal peoples of the world and the practical lives of individual people occasioned by mystical experiences and those around them, and so on. It follows the form of addressing life in different times and thus a kind of science fiction, but like other entries in this article emphasizes the inward issues and spiritual discoveries more than the quasi-magical or technological leaps made as part of the plot. Mr. Shepperd prefers the term \"social fiction\" rather than science fiction. The Bahá'ís, or any paraphrases of principles of the religion, are at best obliquely referred to until late in the second section, of the near past, when an Iranian Doctor mentions the Bahá’í Faith and his reasons for living in a place far from his home and how the principles of the religion stand in the context of the international challenges and needs of humanity. A key character in the book shows interest and later joins the religion but aside from a few specifics there is no clear statement of the future position of the religion nor how the future world culture was established (brief references to a dual process that has merged before the distant future, but doesn't state explicitly what place the Bahá’í Faith has in this pattern.) However, in the header of each section there is a text presented with a dating scheme that is exactly that of the Bahá'í calendar so for example 2007 of the common calendar is year 163 of the Bahá’í Era, or BE. While the textual reference is exact it only becomes clear when the two dating schemes are cross referenced and the explicit mention of the religion had already been made. Late in the story the Universal House of Justice is mentioned as having 19 members and a metropolis called Haifaakka is mentioned. However the Bahá'í Faith is not framed as the singular or dominant theme of the story - it is but an explicit component of the plot occasionally and a subtext for specifics recognizable but not identified as specifically related to the religion. In other words, the majority of the content of the book describes how the world at large arrives at a Bahá’í oriented future, but not how the Bahá’í Faith itself arrives to be in that position.\n\nMr. Sheppherd has published about 10 works before the year 2000 (and lost an additional 15 unpublished works in a house fire in 2002) ranging from professional publications to Bahá'í centered works whether of formal introduction or children's literature, poetry or this science/speculative fiction analysis of the multi-century changes based on humanity's response to religion centered in the non-west, specifically an African island.\n\nRex Mundi is an American comic book published by Dark Horse Comics written by Bahá'í Arvid Nelson. It was first published in 2002 and has run through 2008.\n\nThe series is a quest for the Holy Grail told as a murder mystery. It is set in the year 1933, in an alternate history Europe, where magic is real, feudalism persisted, and the Protestant Reformation was crushed by a still politically powerful Roman Catholic Church. All of this is woven together as \"… a meditation on the prophecies surrounding the advent of the Bahá'í era.” Nelson compares a central character Genevieve with the role of the Bahá'í Faith - of trying to bring about unity but the story is not used as a means to proselytize the religion.\n\nOfficial synopsis: \"After one of his friends is killed in Iraq, Geoffrey Waters prays for help in understanding God's purpose for humanity. He is whisked forward in time to witness what a world could be like when the prophesies from Isaiah bring about peace on earth, and the lines 'Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven' come to fruition. The people on the planet he visits explain that God's kingdom will be established on Earth no matter what, even if a horrible calamity must occur.\" The Bahá'í author notes that this book is her impression of what the future may be like based on the premise of fulfilled Biblical prophecy, with specifics from Bahá'í sources. There are several quotes and paraphrases from the Bahá'í Writings as well as examples of attitudes among various characters that believe as guided by these references, and the book was approved by the Special Materials Review Committee. Directly it only refers to the Bahá'í Faith as one of many religions mentioned in the foreword (which also mentions that it is meant to be the first of a trilogy.) Internally the strongest reference perhaps is the name of the Book of the religion of the future - \"Qadas\", which is similar to \"Aqdas\" - the central Book of Laws, of the Bahá'í Faith. However \"Qadas\" could also be rather more obscure references (\"the holiness of God\", or a Muslim style of prayer for example.) The overall feel of the story is much like Madeleine L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time - of grand themes being played out not through technological achievements, but of spiritual beings and achievements. Ralya has also published children’s stories, two full-length musicals, a weekly newspaper column in a Minnesota paper for about 2 years, and a novel for 9- to 15-year-olds which also has significant reference to the Bahá'í Faith.\n\n\"Doing the Impossible\" official synopsis mentions \"three fifteen-year-old girls are starting their sophomore year of high school. The 'impossible' thing they are trying to do is living according to God's standards in modern society. Megan gets the lead in the high school play, but her character is a rather 'loose' woman. Her leading man is more interested in 'fun' than appropriateness… Ashley has a learning disability and wrestles with feeling dumb and unattractive. Brittney is very smart, but overweight. She deals with her body image as well as where a smart female fits in society without being considered aggressive. Baha’i school on Sunday mornings adds the different perspectives of other students.\"\n\nThe unique contribution Ralya has made to the Bahá'í Faith in fiction is that her works center on the moral dilemmas of modern society in the west and spiritual insights and development that reflect an understanding of the teachings of the Bahá'í Faith in response to these challenges. On the one hand she has envisioned an attainable utopia (that is, not completely perfect) with specifics based on suggestions made in writings of the Bahá'í Faith. A particularly strong analysis is made of marital fidelity vs the divine law against adultery vs intense love and friendship between a man and a woman not married, though many topics are addressed including the moral and practical need for war, sustainable economics if children and mothers are of central importance to society, attitudes of the oneness of humanity vs racism, the importance of the arts and so on. On the other hand, she has examined many of the same issues in young ladies lives in high school.\n\nLate in 2006, \"The Chalice of Life\" was released by Dragon Moon Press, a small Canadian press specializing in science fiction and fantasy. Webb's book, while intended as a fantasy adventure, includes many themes from the Baha'i Writings, including quotes from a variety of faith traditions and a fantasy version of a society based on the fully realized society of the future envisioned by Baha'u'llah. Central to the plot (although the idea is referred to rather than explained with great explicitness in the first book) is the idea of the School of Transcendent Oneness and the idea that a special class of being is sent into Creation from time to time to help civilization along. She relates this to the \"once and future king\" concept with the introduction of the quest that forms the overall theme for the series: the search for Eliander, a Carotian prince magicked away long ago to a place outside normal space-time. In the second book, \"Tapestry of Enchantment,\" Dragon Moon Press, 2010 this theme of the once and future king comes to the fore when the one character from a world outside the Carotian Union (the system Eliander's return is meant to save) discloses that he believes he is, in fact, living in the time of his own world's Promised One; his search for this Promised One becomes a strong theme in the series and become the pivot point of the sequel. \"Lamp of Truth,\" the third book, is due for publication in early 2011. Dragon Moon has contracted the entire series, the longest work it has ever put under contract, and hopes to release the remainder of the books at the rate of about one every six months (slating Eliander for release sometime in late 2013). Remaining books in the series and their settings include \"The Life of the Smith\" (ancient Greece); \"The Floodwaters of Redemption\" (Mu right before it founders); \"The Treasure of Mobius\" (a world projected by a powerful projective telempath; yes, it has one-sided buildings); \"Dwellers in the Underdark\" (the Underdark, home of the terrifying Azhur race); and \"The King That Will Be\" (variously the planes of incarcertation of the quest's nemesis and Eliander as well as home on Caros).\n\nJackie Mehrabi has written several fiction books for children and young teens, often about the lives of fictional Bahá'ís with a moral message behind each tale, and received the 2011 Joe Foster Award for Services to Education as a writer.\n\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill faculty member Mark Perry has written three plays on the religion's history and teachings: \"On the Rooftop with Bill Sears\" as a quasi-biography of Bill Sears, \"Band of Gold\" about a Persian-American couple getting married, and \"A new dress for Mona\" (revised from the original \"A dress for Mona\", a finalist for the 2003 Triangle Theatre Awards for best original screenplay,) about the life and death of Mona Mahmudnizhad, that have been anthologized as \"The Lover at the Wall: 3 Plays on Baha'i Subjects\".\n\nOne of the stories from Stephen Leacock's bestselling 1914 book \"Arcadian Adventures with the Idle Rich\" features a character that caricatures the religious leader `Abdu'l-Bahá.\n\nPhilip K. Dick's science-fiction novel \"Eye in the Sky\" features a parallel world theocracy dominated by a church of the \"Second Bab\". However, no attempt is made to explore the Baha'i Faith; it reads as a satire of Christian Fundamentalism.\n\nJoe Haldeman's science-fiction novel \"The Accidental Time Machine\" mentions \"…B'hai all over the place…\". in the Western United States two thousand years in the future.\n\nJames A. Michener's 1965 novel \"The Source\" mentions the golden dome of the Shrine of the Bab as, \"...golden dome of the Baha'i temple...\".\n\nThe futuristic hero of Robert Sheckley's 1960s SF novel \"Mindswap\", \"Like everyone else, … had worshipped in the Bahai temple in Haifa.\"\n\nThe novel \"In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate\" by Tim Parise features a Baha'i character who is a member of a nonviolent resistance movement opposing the Iranian government.\n\nThree Baha'is escaping from Iran, afloat in wreckage in the Arabian Sea, are rescued by a U.S. Navy ship in \"Tipping Point\", by David Poyer.\n\n\"Zendegi\" by Greg Egan lists a number of groups held in Evin prison in Iran. \"This is where Baha'i ended up, for the crime of believing in one prophet too many, ...\"\n\nIn 1959 \"Come Back, Africa\" film about Apartheid mentions the religion as part of the discussion on the philosophical underpinnings of how the Africans were to respond to the challenge of Apartheid. The mention of the religion begins about 1 hr 10 min into the film, after the performance of Miriam Makeba. It is not known if the cause of the mention of the religion was scripted or improvised, and if by the choice of Lionel Rogosin, the filmmaker (who may have encountered the religion in Israel or the USA) or the Africans themselves because of their exposure to the religion in the country.\n\nIn addition to being mentioned directly in a number of works, the Bahá'í Faith and/or its teachings have also been mentioned in the TV and movie industry. For example, the TV series \"The Simpsons\" has twice referenced the Bahá'ís - once when Lisa Simpson is considering what religion to join in the episode \"She of Little Faith\" she sees \"Bed, Bath and Bahá'í\" on a sign (she ends up converting to Buddhism) and also when Bart Simpson is playing Billy Graham's Bible Blaster, a Christian video game (where the player has to convert heathens to Christianity) \"a gentle Baha'i\" is one of the images on the screen at Ned Flanders' house in the episode \"Alone Again, Natura-Diddily\".\n\nThe movie \"The Matrix\" uses parallel terminology to the Bahá’í Faith but there is little evidence that the movie or its makers were influenced by the religion specifically (more likely Buddhism and Gnostic Christianity). However a movie critic did use the Bahá’í Faith as the lead off in his review.\n\nThere was also a TV medical-drama in Australia called \"MDA - Medical Defense Australia\" (MDA (TV series)) which went on the air on 23 July 2002 with an ongoing Bahá'í character, Layla Young, who is played by a non-Bahá'í actress Petra Yared.\n\nThe role-playing game \"Trinity\" by White Wolf Game Studio, in a futuristic setting, includes a faction called the Interplanetary School for Research and Advancement. Many of its members are humans with psionic powers related to clairsentience. The leader, and as a result many of his followers, is a member of the Bahá'í Faith. A second role-playing game, this one based in computer technology, is called \"The Seven Valleys\" named after \"The Seven Valleys\" and uses it explicitly as inspirations for its adventures.\n\nThe 14 April 2012 episode of a Prairie Home Companion's \"News from Lake Wobegone\" has the character Pastor Liz stopped by a highway patrolman who had grown up Lutheran from a family of Lutherans when he met and married a Bahá'í (Sasha) and converted. The section occurs about 101:25 through 104:55 minutes.\n\nIn 2015 the TV show Backstrom, the character Sgt. Peter Niedermayer quotes religious figures in the show - he quotes Bahá'u'llah in the premiere episode at about 17:22-17:32 into the show.\n\nFor research and review, the reader may be interested in a few notable instances of research and materials to the presence of the Bahá'í Faith in Fiction:\n\n\"This annotated bibliography list, a subset derived from the Adherents.com Religion in Literature database, is intended as a resource for literary research. It lists both mainstream and Baha'i-oriented science fiction/fantasy novels or short stories which contain references to Baha'is. It is not necessarily a comprehensive list of such literature, but all Hugo- and Nebula-winning novels have been surveyed, as have many other major works.\"\n\n\"Submissions and book excerpts welcomed. Fiction of larger scale and/or historical import is preferred, though new works by Baha'i authors can also be showcased here.\"\n\n\n"}

The 1825 edition of that book has the following entry:\n\nThe word \"cambion\" previously appeared on an early first century AD inscription in Gaul (Roman France). Linguist Benjamin W. Forston IV opines that:\nGiven the above, it is probable that the word, as de Plancy defined it in 1818, is a cognate for changeling.\n\nThe \"Malleus Maleficarum\" does not use the word but states that demons, including the incubus and the succubus, are incapable of reproduction:\n\nBecause of this inability to create or nurture life, the method of the creation of a cambion is necessarily protracted. A succubus will have sex with a human male and so acquire a sample of his sperm. This she will then pass on to an incubus. The incubus will, in his turn, transfer the sperm to a human female and thus impregnate her.\n\nThe text goes on to discuss at great length the arguments for and against this process being possible, citing a number of biblical quotations and noted scholars in support of its arguments, and finally concludes that this is indeed the method used by such demons.\n\nIn the \"Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology\" the cambion is said to be the direct offspring of the incubus and the succubus, foregoing any need for human involvement. This same incarnation retained the absence of breath or a pulse until seven years of age, but was said to also have been incredibly heavy (even too heavy for a horse to carry) and to have cried upon being touched.\n\n"}

The award is also known as the \"Cheung Kong Scholar\" award and is referred to in English both internationally and by official Chinese government publications as the \"Yangtze River\" Scholar award.\n\nThe initial funding for this program was provided by the Hong Kong-based Li Ka Shing Foundation (李嘉诚基金会), with the goal of elevating research at Chinese universities to the highest levels internationally. The program began in August 1998. \n\nThe program has enabled Chinese universities to provide international recognition to leading academics, but has led to difficulties for less prestigious universities in China. Individuals who receive the Changjiang (Yangtze River) Scholar award have become targets for recruitment by competing Chinese universities so frequently that the Ministry of Education issued a notice in 2013 barring universities from hiring away Changjiang professors, and another 2017 discouraging Chinese universities from recruiting away top faculty from one another.\n\nThe Changjiang Scholars Program mainly recognizes China’s domestic top scholars, who receive the prestigious title of Changjiang Distinguished Professor at their own Chinese universities and are provided with some research resources to enhance the recipients' research programs. This is in contrast to the Thousand Talents Plan, which recruits top experts from overseas and is administered separately and directly by the central government.\n\nAlthough the award is rarely granted to foreign scientists, a few renowned international scholars are chosen each year. These internationally renowned scholars include Nobel Prize Laureates and members of US National Academy of Engineering. They are typically honored with a guest or visiting professorship at a major university, with the prestigious title of Changjiang Scholar. These world-class visiting professorships help significantly raise their host universities' international visibility.\n\nAlthough these professorships can be affiliated with any university in China, they are awarded disproportionately to individuals affiliated with the most prestigious (C9 League) universities.\n\n"}

{"id": "27408374", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27408374", "title": "Computers in the classroom", "text": "Computers in the classroom\n\nComputers in the classroom include any digital technology used to enhance, supplement, or replace a traditional educational curriculum. As computers have become more accessible, inexpensive, and powerful, the demand for this technology has increased, leading to more frequent use of computer resources within classes, and a decrease in the student-to-computer ratio within schools.\n\nCollege campuses used computer mainframes in education since the initial days of this technology, and throughout the initial development of computers. The earliest large-scale study of educational computer usage conducted for the National Science Foundation by The American Institute for Research concluded that 13% of the nation's public high schools used computers for instruction, although non-users still outnumbered users at a ratio of 2 to 1. The study also concluded that computers proved to be very popular with students, and that applications run on early models included sports statistic managers, administration tools, and physics simulators.\n\nIn 1975, Apple Inc. began donating Apple 1 model computers to schools, and mainframes began to lose their former dominance over academic research. Computer usage continued to grow rapidly throughout this era. In 1977, it was estimated that over 90% of students at Dartmouth College had used computers at some point in their college careers. Walter Koetke, the director of a Lexington, Massachusetts school system commented that, \"It's still possible for a student to get through here without using the computer, but he would certainly have to try to do it\".\n\nComputer-aided instruction gained widespread acceptance in schools by the early 1980s. It was during this period that drilling and practice programs were first developed for exclusive classroom use. Schools became divided over which computer manufacturers they were willing to support, with grade schools generally using Apple computers and high schools preferring DOS based machines. Hardware shortages in schools became a major issue, leaving many teachers unable to provide enough computers for students to use. Despite this, by 1989 computer usage shifted from being a relative rarity in American public schools, to being present in nearly every school district.\n\nThe early 1990s marked the beginning of modern media technology such as CD-ROMs as well as the development of modern presentation software such as Microsoft PowerPoint. Other computer-based technology including the electronic whiteboard and the laptop computer became widely available to students. In 1990, the Methodist Ladies' College became the first campus to require every student to purchase a laptop. Governments around the world began to take notice of the effectiveness of this policy, and began financial initiatives to significantly increase the use of laptop computers in other colleges as well. In 1996, Bill Clinton made over $2 billion in grants available in the Technology Literacy Challenge Fund, a program which challenged schools to make computers available to every student, connected to the outside world, and engaging. This marked a significant increase in the demand for computer technology in many public school systems throughout the globe.\n\nCorrelating with the development of modern operating systems like Windows 98 and the continuing support of government funding, the prevalence of educational computer usage boomed during this era. Between 1997 and 1999, the ratio of students to multimedia computers decreased from 21 students per machine to less than 10 students per machine. Colleges began creating specialized classrooms designed to provide students with access to the utilization of the most modern technology available. Classrooms such as the \"Classroom 2000\" built at Georgia Tech in 1999 which featured computers with audio and video equipment designed to capture detailed recordings of lectures as a replacement for traditional note taking began to become more common. By 2000, the student to computer ratio at some schools in the US decreased to only 5 students per school computer.\n\nAs collaborative classroom environments became mainstream, more schools as a whole began to invest in powerful networks and faster Internet connections. By 2010, many school districts implemented or encouraged \"1:1 learning programs\" which would ensure that all students in grade school would be provided with a personal laptop. Computers have significantly changed traditional teaching methodology into a more \"hands-on\" approach, with Forbes predicting that, \"Instead of parking themselves in a lecture hall for hours, students will work in collaborative spaces, where future doctors, lawyers, business leaders, engineers, journalists and artists learn to integrate their different approaches to problem solving and innovate together.\"\n\nExperience has shown, however, that excessive use of computers can be detrimental to a student's basic academic skills. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has compared average student literacy, numeracy and science skills in 31 countries (considering three large cities in China separately). It also compared the levels of student computer use in those same countries. The study's conclusion, after correcting for social backgrounds and student demographics, was that moderate use of classroom computers produces the best educational outcomes.\n\nThe shift in worldwide computer usage and the need for computer skills in today's workforce have pushed the United States government to create guidelines for educators to ensure that students are prepared to meet the demands of the 21st century. The Core Curriculum Content Standards for education are aimed at preparing students with such skills demanded of those entering the 21st century learning environment as well as the 21st century and work environment.\n\nChanges such as this, along with the changes in the ways that 21st century learners communicate, have impacted the ways that classroom computers are utilized. Currently, teachers are tapping into the enhanced abilities of current classroom computer technology by utilizing various Web 2.0 tools to enhance their instruction. Such tools are also being used to extend classroom communication outside of the campus through online collaborative tools. Centered primarily on collaboration and sharing, Web 2.0 computer applications encourage student self-expression; interaction with peers, and opportunity for authentic learning experiences Through the implementation and integration of Web 2.0 computer technologies into the classroom setting, authentic and meaningful learning experiences are now able to occur in ways that have been previously unimaginable. Currently, the learning that is taking place is not simply about typical concepts or facts as laid out in school curricula. Instead, it is about the process of building connections As a result, the awareness of the importance and the value of communication is becoming instilled into children. Today, with a single laptop, Webcam, projector, and an Internet connection, a teacher can broadcast and begin collaboration with any other classroom. As groups of learners coalesce around shared passions online, they experience something that is difficult to replicate in physical space.\n\nClassroom computer access to Web 2.0 applications such as online learning communities and interactive educational tools offer a more dynamic learning experience, with direct benefits to students. Web 2.0 technologies that are being utilized within the classroom have made it possible for essential learning to be introduced to students during their elementary levels of education and to be refined through their middle, high school and collegiate experiences. As classroom computer technology is being used for different types of communication—for presentation, for class interaction, and for collaboration, students are required to be readers and writers, editors and publishers; and must be willing to collaborate and co-create with others, working closely together to learn even more in the process. Web 2.0 Interaction involves not only sharing ideas or information with someone else, but also receiving feedback. The collaboration engages groups of people in not only sending and receiving feedback but working together for creating, building, and editing, These skills are a necessity for students' futures as they grow and enter the workplace.\n\nThe goal of using such computer applications is to increase peer-to-peer interactions through digital means, in order to replicate real-life 21st century communication skills. One such technology that has gained significant recognition within K-12 education is the Weblog. Weblogs, or blogs, are frequently accessed on classroom computers due to their positive effects upon students. These online journals are primarily used to support communication in the form of presentation, and they provide a useful tool for class interaction. Weblogs allow students to present their own findings and discoveries to an authentic audience. Receiving feedback about course work not just from your teacher but from your peers, or possibly from the outside world, can be very empowering to students. In their eyes, having the ability to publish their writing on a blog suddenly transforms them into authors and publishers. Blogs make students are of careful and conscientious writing. Students are no longer writing for an audience of one. Instead, their words face an audience of their peers as well as countless others whose primary goal is not only to read, but also to provide commentary, feedback and even to critique and criticize their words. By using classroom computers for such means, students become increasingly more cautious and aware of their grammar, spelling and word-choice knowing that they are the authors of a published piece of writing that will reach a wide audience.\n\nSimilarly, Wikis are commonly accessed on classroom computers due to their positive impacts. The collaborative environment that wikis facilitate can teach students much about how to work with others, how to create community, and how to operate in a world where the creation of knowledge and information is increasingly becoming a group effort. The implementations and uses of wikis range from the development of group-based writing projects, to collaborative note taking, to brainstorming. Teachers can set up wikis for groups of students, giving them the opportunity to all join in on equal footing to give feedback, to make suggestions and changes, and to jot down ideas. With a wiki, everyone is an author of the wiki at the same time. Additionally, Wikis afford students the opportunity to express themselves using multiple modalities. Therefore, children who struggle to express themselves through the written word, are now at ease due to ability to insert music, graphics, video, and photos into their writing. With the help of this technology, students who struggle with language are now able to create multimodal compositions, allowing them to communicate meanings that were once inaccessible or not fully expressed through their printed word. These ongoing collaborative efforts also reinforce the notion of careful, contentious writing. Students' words are no longer for an audience of one, but instead for an audience of countless individuals. The awareness of this global reach reminds students to be cautious with grammar, word choice and style as they know that others will be expanding upon their written ideas.\n\nBecause of their versatility, Podcasts are also commonly accessed on classroom computers. These downloadable, portable files allow listeners to subscribe to digitally recorded audio clips and replay them at their own convenience. Similarly, the use of Vodcasts has become almost as common, as they allow for students to view digitally recorded video on classroom computers. Accessing Podcasts and Vodcasts on classroom computers allows for differentiated instruction within the classroom environment. These technologies provide students with the opportunity to learn at their own pace and the freedom to go back whenever possible and as frequently as necessary in order to check their understanding. Podcasts are offering ESL students, and those with learning disabilities, the chance to review lectures at their own pace for increased comprehension. Many ELL and ESL students need additional support with defining commonly used language as well as with the pronunciation of new vocabulary. Other students, such as those with special needs have difficulty reading and reviewing complex texts. Accessing Podcasts and Vodcasts on classroom computers can easily provide helpful tools to address these students' needs.\n\nThere is very little evidence that shows that teachers are making proper use of computers in the classroom. Intrinsic barriers such as a belief in more traditional teaching practices and individual attitudes towards computers in education as well as the teachers own comfort with computers and their ability to use them all result in varying effectiveness in the integration of computers in the classroom. Even with the increased access to computers within education systems the actual use of computers in the class room lacks meaningful activities that involve the students. Teachers also appear to abandon the intended educational uses of the computers purely for communication between staff and parents as well as preparation of more traditional learning materials.\n"}

Later the development of written languages made it easier to maintain traditions of the Taiwanese culture.\n\nThe recorded history of Taiwanese culture mainly stemmed from traditional Chinese culture, despite the influences from other foreign powers. Although the culture of modern Taiwan is significantly affected by Japanese and American cultures, the values and traditions of the Taiwanese people are heavily based on Confucianist Han cultures.\n\nThe cultures in Taiwan's New Stone Age (began ca. 5000 BCE) were all left by Austronesian people. However, there may be other settlers prior to the arrival of the Austronesian people.\n\nIn addition, the plains aborigines influenced the beliefs, music, and names, of places in Taiwan. These aboriginal tribes include Ketagalan, Kavalan, Taokas, and Babuza peoples. However, over the course of three centuries of Han Chinese migrations to Taiwan, the distinctive cultures gradually disappeared, creating an integrated cultural blend.\n\nThe 1620s saw a major turning point in Taiwan's cultural history due to the introduction of the Sinckan Manuscripts. The written language was brought to Taiwan by Dutch missionaries. The prehistory of Taiwan was brought to an end as a result.\n\nAs a result of Taiwan's strategic position, many foreign powers were interested in establishing settlements in Taiwan. Taiwan was first introduced to European nations in approximately the mid-sixteenth century by Portuguese explorers, who called the island \"Ilha Formosa,\" which means \"Beautiful Island, and the neighboring islands \"Pescadores,\" which means \"Fishermen.\"\n\nThe Dutch East India Company invaded the Pescadores in 1622. After several battles with Ming forces, the Dutch agreed to retreat to the island of Taiwan, which was not part of the Ming territories. In 1624, the Dutch established a trading post in present-day Tainan City and built its political center at Fort Zeelandia. Due to the shortage of labor, the Dutch recruited Han migrants. As a result, the previous tribal society drastically changed.\n\nThe Dutch were not the only European settlers in Taiwan. In 1626, the Spaniards established settlements in northern Taiwan. Fort San Salvador was built in present-day Keelung. Later, they expanded their territory to present-day Yilan and Tamsui, and built Fort Santo Domingo, which still exists today. Spanish missionaries converted many aborigines to Catholicism. However, the Dutch attacked Spanish settlements in northern Taiwan in 1642, drove out the Spaniards, and occupied their territories.\n\n"}
{"id": "17146474", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17146474", "title": "Cultural schema theory", "text": "Cultural schema theory\n\nCultural schema theory holds that human beings employ classification to understand members of other cultures, and add new data to previously available categories. Cultural schemas for social interaction are cognitive structures that contain knowledge for face-to-face interactions in a person's cultural environment. Schemas are generalized collections of knowledge of past experiences that are organized into related knowledge groups; they guide our behaviours in familiar situations. Cultural schemas do not differ from other schemas, except that they are shared by certain cultural groups rather than individuals (Garro, 2000). Schemas unique to individuals are created from personal experiences, whereas those shared by individuals are created from various types of common experiences (Garro, 2000). Cultural schema theory proposes that when we interact with members of the same culture in certain situations many times, or talk about certain information with them many times, cultural schemas are created and stored in our brain (Nishida, 1999).\n\nCultural schema theory may be a relatively new theory, but neither schema nor cultural schema are new concepts.\n\nThe idea of schemas existing as ideal types in the mind dates back all the way back to Plato (see also Schema and Schema (psychology)) . In the 19th century German philosopher Immanuel Kant developed the idea that every person's experiences are gathered in memory, forming higher order concepts. In the 1920s Jean Piaget's work investigated schemas in infants. In the 1930s Frederic Bartlett tested memory for schemas. From the 1970s to the 1990s, many researchers obtained loads of evidence showing that people's behaviors are deeply embedded to what they store in their brains. Through these studies researchers learned that human behavior relies heavily on past experiences and the knowledge stored in one's brain.\n\nResearch also revealed that schemas operate at many different levels. The experiences which are unique to individuals allow them to acquire personal schemas. Societal schemas may emerge from a group's collective knowledge and are represented across the minds in a society, enabling people to think as if they are one mind (Malcolm & Sharifian, 2002). However, when one's cultural environment provides experiences to which every member of that culture is exposed, their experiences allow every member to acquire cultural schemas (Nishida, 1999). Cultural schemas are conceptual structures which enable individuals to store perceptual and conceptual information about their culture and interpret cultural experiences and expressions. If people are not equipped with the appropriate cultural schema, they may not be able to make sense of culturally unfamiliar situations (Malcolm & Sharifian, 2002).\n\nWhen one interacts with members of the same culture over and over again, or talks about certain information with them many times, cultural schemas are created and stored in one's brain. Subsequent similar instances cause the cultural schema to become more organized, abstract, and compact. As this occurs, communication becomes much easier. Nishida (1999) simply explains that experience is the force which creates cultural schemas. As people have more experiences their developing cultural schemas become more tightly organized. The information not only becomes more complex, but more useful among members of a culture, alike or different. Beyond the cognitive activity of cultural schemas is the complex pattern which occurs in the brain.\n\nWhen humans acquire and retain information from their surrounding environments, neural circuits are generated. Consequently, information processing experience is stored in the long-term memory. Memory representation or neural circuits created in the brain as a result of information processing are assumed to be schemas . Thus, schemas provide a foundation in the brain which helps to predict what is to be expected and looked for in certain situations.\n\nNot all schemas are uniformly important. High-level schemas are internalized and emotionally salient; likewise, when a schema is only weakly related to a person's self it becomes emotionally empty and irrelevant (Lipset, 1993).\n\nCultural schemas for social interactions are cognitive structures that contain knowledge for face-to-face interactions in one's cultural environment. Nishida (1999) points out the eight primary types for generating human behavior for social interactions. These eight schemas are also referred to as Primary Social Interaction (PSI) schemas.\n\n\nThe term cross-cultural adaptation refers to the complex process through which an individual acquires an increasing level of the communication skills of the host culture and of relational development with host nationals. Simply put, cross-cultural adaptation is the transformation of a person's own PSI schemas into those of the host culture and acquisition of new PSI schemas in the host culture s/he is residing in. A number of different people may b e subject to cross-cultural adaptation, including immigrants, refugees, business people, diplomats, foreign workers, and students. However, this entry specifically applies cultural schema theory to sojourners' cross cultural adaptation. Sojourners generally spend a few years in another culture while intending to return to their home country. Business people, diplomats, students, and foreign workers can all be classified as sojourners. In order to better explain sojourners' cross-cultural adaptation, axioms are used to express causal, correlational, or teleological relationships. Axioms also help to explain the basic assumptions of the Cultural Schema Theory (Nishida, 1999).\n\nNishida (1999) describes the following nine axioms:\n\nAxiom 1: The more often a person repeats a schema-based behavior in his or her culture, the more likely the cultural schema will be stored in the person's memory.\n\nAxiom 2: Sojourners' failure to recognize the actions and behaviors that are relevant to meaningful interactions in the host culture are mainly due to their lack of the PSI schemas of the culture.\n\nAxiom 3: The acquisition of the PSI schemas of the host culture is a necessary condition for sojourners' cross-cultural adaptation to the culture.\n\nAxiom 4: The PSI schemas of a person's own culture are interrelated with each other, forming a network of cultural schemas to generate behaviors that are appropriate in the culture. Experience in the host culture causes a change in one's cultural schema. This causes further changes in all other cultural schemas and results in a total change in behavior.\n\nAxiom 5: The acquisition of information about interrelationships among the PSI schemas of the host culture is a necessary condition for sojourners' cross-cultural adaptation.\n\nAxiom 6: People use both schema-driven and data-driven processing to perceive new information, depending on the situation and their motivations.\n\nAxiom 7: If one has well-organized cultural schemas, schematically salient information is more likely to be processed through the schemas, whereas ambiguous information will either direct a search for the relevant data to complete the stimulus more fully, or it will be filled in with default options of the schemas.\n\nAxiom 8: Sojourners who lack the PSI schemas of the host culture are more likely to employ data-driven processing, which requires effort and attention.\n\nAxiom 9: In the host culture, sojourners encounter truly novel situations where they experience cognitive uncertainty and anxiety because of the lack of the PSI schemas in the situations.\n\nAxiom 10: In the host culture, sojourners experience the stages of self-regulation and self-direction. In the stage of self-regulation, they try to resolve ambiguities and to establish integration of information using their native-culture schemas by gradually modifying them. In the stage of self-direction, on the other hand, they actively try to reorganize their native culture schemas or to generate host culture schemas in order to adapt to the host-culture environment.\n\nAs discussed above, sojourners are people who live in a culture other than their own with the intent of one day returning home. For sojourner Gillian Gibbons' situation, the cultural schema theory is highly applicable. Ms. Gibbons, a British school teacher, left Liverpool, England in August 2007 to teach a group of six- and seven-year-olds at Unity School in Khartoum, Sudan. Shortly after her arrival, Ms. Gibbons class was due to study the habitat and behavior of bears. Upon her request, a student brought in a teddy bear to serve as a case study. Students were invited to vote on a name for the bear. After considering the names Abdullah and Hassan, 20 of the 23 children voted in favor of the name Muhammad. What seemed like a harmless children's learning tool took a turn for the worse on November 25, 2007, when Ms. Gibbons was arrested at her home inside the school premises; Sudanese police claimed a number of parents complained to Sudan's Ministry of Education about the bear. Charges against Ms. Gibbons were prepared under article 125 of Sudanese criminal law which covers insults against faith and religions. Ms Gibbons' particular crime: insulting Islam's Prophet Muhammad. In Islam, insulting the Prophet Muhammad is considered a grave offense. Ms. Gibbons' was held in a Khartoum jail facing a maximum penalty of 40 lashes and 6 months in jail. Ms. Gibbons was found guilty of insulting Islam and sentenced to 15 days in jail and deportation from Sudan after her release. Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir granted her a pardon after she served nine days in jail due to pressure from the British government. She immediately returned to England upon her release. While colleagues, friends, and family regarded the whole situation as a misunderstanding, many local Sudanese disagreed. Hundreds of protestors gathered outside of the presidential palace to denounce Ms. Gibbons. Some protestors waved ceremonial swords, some voiced anger at the Sudanese government for not treating her more severely, some distributed leaflets which condemned her as an infidel and accused her of polluting children's mentality by her actions. At the edge of extreme were those who called for her execution (BBC News, 2007; CNN, 2007; New York Times, 2007; TIME, 2007; Times Online, 2007). This highly publicized incident can be explained quite well by the cultural schema theory, particularly by discussing Ms. Gibbons' status as a sojourner in an unfamiliar culture. Axiom number three and axiom number nine apply quite well to Ms. Gibbons. As a sojourner, the acquisition of host culture PSI schemas would be necessary in order for the sojourner's cross-cultural adaptation to occur. Ms. Gibbons may have lived in Sudan, but she lived inside the walls of Unity School. According to BBC News (2007), once inside the walls of Unity School one would think s/he was at standing on the grounds of an Oxbridge University. This private school with children of well-to-do parents is much different than the rest of Sudan. Ms. Gibbons did not need to acquire the PSI schemas of the host culture because her native PSI schemas worked equally well inside the walls of Unity School. Had Ms. Gibbons been constantly made aware of the local PSI schemas (naming an animal after the Prophet Muhammad is unacceptable) she may have adapted and not allowed the children to name the teddy bear Muhammad. Naming a teddy bear was not a novel situation to her as a children's school teacher, but she was not in England. After the bear's naming she certainly encountered a novel situation where she experienced cognitive uncertainty and anxiety because of her lack of the PSI schemas in the situation. Hence the difficulties of cross-cultural adaptation for sojourners like Ms. Gibbons. They do not intend to stay and thus will not adapt/experience the stages of axioms which will best prepare them to appropriately fit in.\n\nCultural Schema Theory is often compared and contrasted with the Cultural Consensus Theory. Both theories present distinct perspectives about the nature of individual and cultural knowledge. However, unlike the Cultural Schema Theory, the Cultural Consensus Theory helps to describe and mathematically measure the extent to which cultural beliefs are shared. The central idea is the use of the pattern of agreement or consensus among members of the same culture. Essentially, the more knowledge people have, the more consensus is observed among them. Unfortunately, the Cultural Consensus Theory does not help others to better understand intracultural variability or how cultural knowledge is interrelated at a cognitive level. Cultural Consensus Theory anticipates intracultural variation but views variation as analogous to performance on a cultural test, with certain individuals functioning as better guides than others to the cultural information pool (Garro, 2000).\n\nSimply put, cultural schema theory can be described as cultural-specific world knowledge (Razi, 2002). As mentioned above, the concept of Cultural Schemas is not new, but the theory is. Future studies must generate theorems and further tests must be conducted in order to better formulate theory itself and the axioms it proposes. Once this is complete the theory can be used in cross-cultural training purposes in order to facilitate individuals' adaptation to their respective host-culture environments (Nishida, 1999). There has been efforts to make this task done. For example, Ehsan Shahghasemi and D. Ray Heisey (2009) introduce the notion of \"cross cultual schemata\" as \"abstract mental structures that one makes according to his/her past experiences or shared knowledge about the members of other cultures and thus makes them more understandable.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "26123028", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26123028", "title": "Hetoimasia", "text": "Hetoimasia\n\nThe Hetoimasia, Etimasia (Greek ἑτοιμασία, \"preparation\"), prepared throne, Preparation of the Throne, ready throne or Throne of the Second Coming is the Christian version of the symbolic subject of the empty throne found in the art of the ancient world, whose meaning has changed over the centuries. In Ancient Greece it represented Zeus, chief of the gods, and in early Buddhist art it represented the Buddha. In Early Christian art and Early Medieval art it is found in both the East and Western churches, and represents either Christ, or sometimes God the Father as part of the Trinity. In the Middle Byzantine period, from about 1000, it came to represent more specifically the throne prepared for the Second Coming of Christ, a meaning it has retained in Eastern Orthodox art to the present. The motif consists of an empty throne and various other symbolic objects, in later depictions surrounded when space allows by angels paying homage. It is usually placed centrally in schemes of composition, very often in a roundel, but typically is not the largest element in a scheme of decoration.\n\nThe \"empty throne\" had a long pre-Christian history. An Assyrian relief in Berlin of c. 1243 BCE shows King Tukulti-Ninurta I kneeling before the empty throne of the fire-god Nusku, occupied by what appears to be a flame. The Hittites put thrones in important shrines for the spirit of the dead person to occupy, and the Etruscans left an empty seat at the head of the table at religious feasts for the god to join the company. A somewhat controversial theory, held by many specialists, sees the Israelite Ark of the Covenant, or the figures of the cherubim above it, as an empty throne. A throne with a crown upon it had been a symbol for an absent monarch in Ancient Greek culture since at least the time of Alexander the Great, whose deification allowed secular use for what had previously been a symbol for Zeus, where the attribute placed on the throne was a pair of zig-zag thunderbolts. Early Buddhist art used an empty throne, often under a parasol or Bodhi Tree, from before the time of Christ. This was, in the traditional view, an aniconic symbol for the Buddha; they avoided depicting the Buddha in human form, like early Christians with God the Father. Alternatively, it has been argued that these images represent actual relic-thrones at the major pilgrimage sites which were objects of worship. The throne often contains a symbol such as the dharma wheel or Buddha footprint, as well as a cushion.\n\nLike the Greeks and other ancient peoples, the Romans held ritual banquets for the gods (a ritualized \"theoxenia\"), including the annual Epulum Jovis, and the lectisternium, originally a rare event in times of crisis, first held in 399 BCE according to Livy, but later much more common. A seat for these was called a \"pulvinar\", from \"pulvinus\" (\"cushion\"), and many temples held these; at the banquets statues of the deity were placed on them. There was a pulvinar at the Circus Maximus, on which initially statues and attributes of the gods were placed after a procession during games, but Augustus also occupied it himself (possibly copying Julius Caesar), building a temple-like structure in the seating to house it. Thrones with a jewelled wreath, portrait or sceptre and diadem sitting on them were among the symbols used in the Roman law courts and elsewhere to represent the authority of the absent emperor; this was one of the monarchical attributes awarded by the Roman Senate to Julius Caesar. A seat with jewelled wreath is seen on coins from the Emperor Titus onwards, and on those of Diocletian a seat with a helmet on it represents Mars. Commodus chose to be represented by a seat with the club and lion skin of Hercules, with whom he identified himself. The empty throne continued to be used as a secular symbol of power by the first Christian Emperors, and appears on the Arch of Constantine.\n\nLater non-Christian uses of the empty throne motif include the \"Bema Feast\", the most important annual feast of Persian Manichaeism, when a \"bema\" or empty throne represented the prophet Mani at a meal for worshippers. In the Balinese version of Hinduism, the most prominent element in most temples is the \"padmasana\" or \"Lotus Throne\", an empty throne for the supreme deity Acintya.\n\nThere are several elements found in the image which reflect its changing meaning. The throne itself is always present, and is often backless and armless. In Ancient Greek, a \"thronos\" was a specific but ordinary type of chair with a footstool, and there is very often a footstool in the image. There is often a prominent cushion, and a cloth variously interpreted as Christ's mantle (especially when of imperial purple) or a sudarium may cover or sit on the throne. There may be a crown on the throne. There is often a book, often on the cushion and sometimes open; this represents the gospels in some examples, and in others the Book of Life, always closed and distinguished by its seven seals, following the Book of Apocalypse. There is nearly always a cross (except in images of councils), often a crux gemmata, and in later examples a patriarchal cross with two crossbars. The cloth may be draped round the cross, as may the crown of thorns, which first appears as an isolated motif in this context. This seems to have originated as a victor's wreath around or over the cross, part of the early emphasis on \"Christ as Victor\" found in much cross imagery, but later to have been transmuted into the crown of thorns. It has also been suggested that the wreathed cross motif also was the origin of the Celtic cross.\n\nThe dove of the Holy Spirit may be present. In later versions two of the instruments of the Passion, the Spear and sponge on a stick, stand behind or beside the throne, or are held by angels. The nails from the cross and crown of thorns may sit on the throne, as in the Russian icon illustrated. If angels or archangels are included they are symmetrically placed on either side, either facing the throne or facing out and gesturing towards it; if there is a roundel they may be outside it. In earlier depictions other figures may surround the throne, for example Saints Peter and Paul in Santa Prassede, Rome (9th century). An alternative to the angels is kneeling figures of Adam and Eve in old age paying homage on either side of the throne. These are found in several large wall-paintings and mosaics, from the 12th century mosaics in Torcello Cathedral, the paintings in the Chora Church, and the painted church exterior at Voroneţ Monastery in Romania of 1547.\n\nThe image was one of many aspects of imperial iconography taken up by Early Christians after the Edict of Milan in 313, when the depiction of Jesus as a human figure, especially as a large figure detached from narrative contexts, was still a matter of controversy within Christianity. At the First Council of Nicaea in 325 an empty throne had the imperial insignia on it, representing the emperor Constantine I when he was not present. However within a few decades an empty throne with a book of the gospels on it was being placed in the chamber of church councils to represent Christ, as at the First Council of Ephesus in 431. It has been suggested that the ivory Throne of Maximian in Ravenna, probably a gift from the Eastern Emperor Justinian I, was not made as a throne for personal use by Maximian, who was both Archbishop of Ravenna and the viceroy of the Byzantine territories in North Italy, but as an empty throne to symbolize either the imperial or divine power; Byzantine imagery at this period was sometimes ready to conflate the two. A comparable symbol is the bishop's throne from which the cathedral takes its name, which, unless the bishop happens to be present and sitting in it, functions as a permanent reminder of his authority in his diocese.\n\nIn the earlier versions the throne is most often accompanied by a cross and a scroll or book, which at this stage represents the Gospels. In this form the whole image represents Christ, but when the dove of the Holy Spirit and the cross are seen, the throne appears to represent God the Father, and the whole image the Trinity, a subject that Christian art did not represent directly for several centuries, as showing the Father as a human figure was objectionable. An example of a Trinitarian \"hetoimasia\" is in the Church of the Dormition in Nicaea. From about 1000 the image may bear the title \"hetoimasia\", literally \"preparation\", meaning \"that which has been prepared\" or \"that which is made ready\", and specifically refers to the \"sign of the Son of Man\" and the Last Judgement. By this time the image usually occurs in the West only under direct Byzantine influence, as in Venice and Torcello.\n\nSome Early Christians had believed that the True Cross had miraculously ascended to Heaven, where it remained in readiness to become the glorified \"sign of the Son of man\" (see below) at the Last Judgement. The Discovery by Helena had displaced this view as to the fate of the actual cross, but the idea of the return at the Last Judgement of the glorified cross remained, as in a homily by Pope Leo the Great (d. 461), which was incorporated in the Roman Breviary.\n\nAlthough it is assumed that other examples existed earlier, the earliest surviving Christian \"hetoimasia\" is in the earliest major scheme of church decoration to survive, the mosaics in Santa Maria Maggiore, Rome (432-40), where it occupies the narrow centre of the \"triumphal arch\" separating nave and apse, flanked by angels, a typical placement. It is shown, with a procession of Apostles, on a panel of the Pola ivory casket from Istria. Three now displaced stone reliefs of the subject with other symbols are among the earliest indications of Christian architectural sculpture at this period; they are in Berlin, San Marco, Venice and Nicosia, Cyprus. Elsewhere it may occupy the centre of a frieze below a larger composition in the apse semi-dome, or a position on the main axis of a circular frieze round a central scene in the roof of a dome, as in the Arian Baptistry (start of 6th century) in Ravenna. At Castelseprio it occupies the centre of the apse-side (west-facing) of the triumphal arch. All are central positions, prominent but not dominant. The Baptistry of Neon (late 5th century) in Ravenna is exceptional in using repeated \"hetoimasia\" images in a circular dome frieze of eight images, four each of two types appearing alternately: a hetoimasia with cross in a garden and an altar containing an open book, flanked by two chairs.\n\nThe 6th-century \"throne-reliquary\" in rather crudely carved alabaster, the \"Sedia di San Marco\", was moved from the high altar to the Treasury of San Marco, Venice in 1534. It would only fit a bishop with a slight figure, and has a large compartment for relics below the seat. It may have functioned as a \"throne-lectern\" or resting place for a gospel book, making actual the hetoimasia images with open books.\n\nDuring the Middle Byzantine period the etimasia became a standard feature of the evolving subject of the Last Judgement, found from the 11th century onwards. As in the Western versions descended from the Byzantine images, this was on several tiers, with Christ in Judgement at the top, and in the East the etimasia almost always in the centre of the tier below, but occasionally above Christ. This basic layout has remained in use in Eastern Orthodoxy to the present day, and is found both on church walls and as a painted panel icon. The etimasia was normally omitted in Western versions, except in works under direct Byzantine influence, such as the early 12th century west wall of Torcello Cathedral. \nAnother context in which the etimasia sometimes appears from the Middle Byzantine period is Pentecost, in Orthodoxy also the Feast of the Trinity. Here a trinitarian etimasia with the dove representing the Holy Spirit may be found, as in the 12th century mosaics on the roof of the west dome of St Mark's, Venice, where the centre is an etimasia with book and dove, with the twelve apostles seated round the outer rims, with flames on their heads and rays connecting them to the central throne. Below the apostles pairs of figures representing the \"nations\", with \"tituli\", stand between the windows. Similar images are found in the Chludov Psalter and elsewhere. However, in this case the etimasia did not become part of a conventional composition, and it is not found in modern icons of the Pentecost.\n\nIt has been suggested that the empty stool with a cushion in the foreground of Jan van Eyck's \"Annunciation\" in Washington may suggest the empty throne; van Eyck characteristically uses domestic fittings to represent doctrinal references.\n\nThe image has been regarded as illustrating a number of different passages from the Bible. For the later Byzantines the \"etimasia\" was the \"sign of the Son of man\" of Matthew 24:30:\n\"And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory\". The understanding of the image as a symbol for the Second Coming also drew on Psalms 9:7: \"But the Lord shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment\". where the Septuagint has \"ἡτοίμασεν\" (\"hetoimasen\") for \"prepared\". Psalm 89:14:\"Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face\" is another relevant passage, using the word in the Septuagint (instead of the \"habitation\" of the King James Version), giving \"ἑτοιμασία τοῦ θρόνου\" or \"preparation of your throne\". Throne imagery is found above all in the Book of Revelation, especially chapter 4, although the throne therein is already occupied.\n\nThe Greek verb ἑτοιμασεν (\"hetoimasen\") means \"to prepare\" or \"to make ready\". It will be seen that the name \"hetoimasia\", meaning \"preparation\" or \"that which has been prepared\", with \"throne\" (\"thronos\" in Greek) only implied, is more appropriate to the Eastern images after about 1000 than to those before. The use of the name for both groups was established in the 19th century by the French art historian Paul Durand (from 1867), and despite protests has stuck. In more modern Orthodox contexts \"etimasia\" and \"prepared throne\" are typically used, and in art history relating to the earlier group \"hetoimasia\" and \"empty throne\" - exclusively the latter in non-Christian contexts where a more specialized term is not used. There are various other transliterations and translations: \"hetimasia\", \"throne made ready\" etc.\n\n\nThe main literature is in German - see the list given here.\n"}

For more formal and classical performances, the ensemble may be accompanied by the \"saung gauk\", the Burmese harp, the \"pattala\", a Burmese xylophone, or the piano and violin, both introduced during colonial rule. \"Hsaing waing\" musicians use a hemitonic and anhemitonic scale similar to the one used by Indonesian gamelan musicians.\n\nMusic of the \"hsaing waing\" is characterized by its lively and sudden contrasts and shifts in rhythm, melody and tempo. \"Anyeint\" dance performances, as well as nat gadaw and marionette puppet performances, are accompanied by the music of the \"hsaing waing\", with the sudden shifts in musical rhythm reflected in the dancer's changing poses. However, classical singing, derived from royal chamber music, is almost exclusively accompanied by either a classical ensemble or a single \"saung gauk\". \n\nAlthough the origins of the \"hsaing waing\" are unclear, the earliest pictoral evidence dates to the 17th century, coinciding with the Burmese invasion of the Ayutthaya Kingdom, which may have brought back the concept of the gong and drum ensemble, although the \"hsaing waing\" differs greatly in its diversity of instruments and musical style from Thai ensembles.\n\n"}

The term is fairly common in Europe, but is little known in the English-speaking world, though Digital Humanities (also known as Humanities computing) is in many cases roughly equivalent. \n\nHumanistic informatics departments were generally started in the 1990s when universities rarely taught humanities-based approaches to the rapidly developing computerized society. For this reason, the field was quite broadly defined, and included courses in humanities computing, basic introductions to how computers work, historical developments of technology, technology and learning, digital art and literature and digital culture. Today several departments have declared more specialized areas of research, such as digital arts and culture at the University of Bergen, and socio-cultural communication with and without technology at the University of Aalborg.\n\nDigital Humanities is a primary topic, and there are several universities in the US and the UK that have Digital Arts and Humanities research and development centers. One aspect of Digital Humanities that will grow will be the intersection of new digital media and the humanities, particularly in the gaming industry which has developed both casual and serious gaming and game design strategies to foster learning in the humanities and all other academic disciplines. A key principle in all digital interactive media or games is the storyline; the narrative or quest or goal of the game is primary to both literary works and games. Characters and players go on the quest, and playing the game becomes the narrative. Game design principles, also relevant in literature and the fine arts, include visual literacy and empowering players/learners to align with great artitsts and writers who believe in the creative process.\n\n"}
{"id": "3559307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3559307", "title": "Hybridity", "text": "Hybridity\n\nHybridity, in its most basic sense, refers to mixture. The term originates from biology and was subsequently employed in linguistics and in racial theory in the nineteenth century. Its contemporary uses are scattered across numerous academic disciplines and is salient in popular culture. Hybridity is used in discourses about race, postcolonialism, identity, anti-racism and multiculturalism, and globalization, developed from its roots as a biological term.\n\nHybridity is a cross between two separate races, plants or cultures. A hybrid is something that is mixed, and hybridity is simply mixture. Hybridity is not a new cultural or historical phenomenon. It has been a feature of all civilizations since time immemorial, from the Sumerians through the Egyptians, Greeks and Romans to the present. Both ancient and modern civilizations have, through trade and conquests, borrowed foreign ideas, philosophies, and sciences, thus producing hybrid cultures and societies. The term hybridity itself is not a modern coinage. It was common among the Greeks and Romans. In Latin hybrida or ibrida refers to \"the offspring of a tame sow and a wild boar,\" and by extension to the progeny of a Roman man and a non-Roman woman. The word hybridity was in use in English since the early 17th century and gained popular currency in the 19th century. Charles Darwin used this term in 1837 in reference to his experiments in cross-fertilization in plants. The concept of hybridity was fraught with negative connotations from its incipience. The Greeks and Romans borrowed extensively from other civilizations, the Egyptians and Persians in particular, and creating \"ipso facto\" hybridized cultures, but regarded unfavourably biological hybridity. Aristotle, Plato and Pericles were all opposed to racial mixing between Greeks and \"barbarians\" and viewed biological hybridity as a source of racial degeneration and social disorder. Similarly, within the Roman Empire, which is considered as one of the most multi-ethnic empires, cultural difference was usually integrated into the predominant culture, whereas biological hybridity was condemned. The Romans’ attitudes to racial mixing hardened from the 4th century AD when Rome embraced the Christian faith. This is manifest in the Codex Theodosianus (AD365) which prohibited marriages between Christians and non-Christians, the Jews in particular, and inflicted death penalty on those who did not obey this law. Contempt for biological hybridity did not end with the fall the Roman Empire, but continued throughout the Middle Ages and well into modern times, reaching a peak in the nineteenth century with the rise of Europe into an unrivalled imperial power. Hybridity and fear of racial degeneration caused by the mixing of Europeans and non-Europeans were major concerns in 19th century colonialist discourse prompted by racist pseudo-scientific discourses found in such works as Joseph Arthur de Gobineau's \"Essai sur l’inégalité des races\" and Joseph-Ernest Renan's \"L’Education culturelle et morale\".\n\nAs an explicative term, hybridity became a useful tool in forming a fearful discourse of racial mixing that arose toward the end of the 18th century. Pseudo-scientific models of anatomy and craniometry were used to argue that Africans, Asians, Native Americans, and Pacific Islanders were racially inferior to Europeans. The fear of miscegenation that followed responds to the concern that the offspring of racial interbreeding would result in the dilution of the European race. Hybrids were seen as an aberration, worse than the inferior races, a weak and diseased mutation. Hybridity as a concern for racial purity responds clearly to the zeitgeist of colonialism where, despite the backdrop of the humanitarian age of enlightenment, social hierarchy was beyond contention as was the position of Europeans at its summit. The social transformations that followed the ending of colonial mandates, rising immigration, and economic liberalization profoundly altered the use and understanding of the term hybridity.\n\n\"Hybrid talk\", the rhetoric of hybridity, is fundamentally associated with the emergence of post-colonial discourse and its critiques of cultural imperialism. It is the second stage in the history of hybridity, characterized by literature and theory that study the effects of mixture (hybridity) upon identity and culture. The principal theorists of hybridity are Homi Bhabha, Néstor García Canclini, Stuart Hall, Gayatri Spivak, and Paul Gilroy, whose works respond to the multi-cultural awareness that emerged in the early 1990s.\n\nIn the theoretic development of hybridity, the key text is \"The Location of Culture\" (1994), by Homi Bhabha, wherein the liminality of hybridity is presented as a paradigm of colonial anxiety. The principal proposition is the hybridity of colonial identity, which, as a cultural form, made the colonial masters ambivalent, and, as such, altered the authority of power; as such, Bhabha's arguments are important to the conceptual discussion of \"hybridity\". Hybridity demonstrates how cultures come to be represented by processes of iteration and translation through which their meanings are vicariously addressed to—through—an Other. This contrasts any \"essentialist claims for the inherent authenticity or purity of cultures which, when inscribed in the naturalistic sign of symbolic consciousness frequently become political arguments for the hierarchy and ascendary of powerful cultures.\" This also means that the colonial subject takes place, its subaltern position inscribed in that space of iteration. The colonial subject is located in a place of hybridity, its identity formed in a space of iteration and translation by the colonizer. Bhabha emphasizes that \"the discriminatory effects of the discourse of cultural colonialism, for instance, do not simply or singly refer to a ‘person’… or to a discrimination between mother culture and alien culture…the reference of discrimination is always to a process of splitting as the condition of subjection: a discrimination between the mother and its bastards, the self and its doubles, where the trace of what is disavowed is not repressed but repeated as something different—a mutation.\" Like mimicry, hybridity is a metonymy of presence. Hybridity opens up a space, figuratively speaking, where the construction of a political object that is new, neither the colonizer nor the Other, properly defies our political expectations. However, like Bhabha's concept of mimicry, hybridity is a doubling, dissembling image of being in at least two places at once. This turn in the effect of hybridity makes the presence of colonist authority no longer immediately visible.\n\nBhabha includes interpretations of hybridity in postcolonial discourse. One is that he sees hybridity as a strategic reversal of the process domination through disavowal. Hybridity reevaluates the assumption of colonial identity through the repetition of discriminatory identity effects. In this way, hybridity can unsettle the narcissist demands of colonial power, but reforms its identifications in strategies of subversion that turn the gaze of the discriminated back upon the colonist. Therefore, with this interpretation, hybridity represents that ambivalent ‘turn’ of the subject into the anxiety-causing object of \"paranoid classification—a disturbing questioning of the images and presences of authority\". The hybrid retains the actual semblance of the authoritative symbol but reforms its presence by denying it as the signifier of disfigurement—after the intervention of difference. In turn, mimicry is the effect of hybridity. First, the metonymy of presence supports the authoritarian voyeurism, but then as discrimination turns into the assertion of the hybrid, the sign of authority becomes a mask, a mockery.\n\nAlthough the original, theoretic development of hybridity addressed the narratives of cultural imperialism, Bhabha's work also comprehends the cultural politics of the condition of being \"a migrant\" in the contemporary metropolis. Yet hybridity no longer is solely associated with migrant populations and with border towns, it also applies contextually to the flow of cultures and their interactions.\n\nThat critique of cultural imperialist hybridity meant that the rhetoric of hybridity progressed to challenging essentialism, and is applied to sociological theories of identity, multiculturalism, and racism. Moreover, \"polyphony\" is another important element of hybridity theory, by Mikhail Bakhtin, which is applied to hybrid discourses presented in folklore and anthropology.\n\nThe development of hybridity theory as a discourse of anti-essentialism marked the height of the popularity of academic \"hybridity talk\". However the usage of hybridity in theory to eliminate essentialist thinking and practices (namely racism) failed as hybridity itself is prone to the same essentialist framework and thus requires definition and placement. A number of arguments have followed in which promoters and detractors argue the uses of hybridity theory. Much of this debate can be criticized as being excessively bogged down in theory and pertaining to some unhelpful quarrels on the direction hybridity should progress e.g. attached to racial theory, post-colonialism, cultural studies, or globalization. Sociologist Jan Nederveen Pieterse highlights these core arguments in a debate that promotes hybridity.\n\nSome on the left, such as cultural theorist John Hutnyk, have criticized hybridity as politically void. Others like Aijaz Ahmad, Arif Dirlik, and Benita Parry blame Homi Bhabha for recycling obscure psychoanalytic and postmodern theories of culture and identity. Ahmad criticizes Bhabha for establishing a postcolonial theory which overlooks the material colonial context and post-independence realities of the former colonies. He writes: \"Between postcoloniality as it exists in a former colony like India, and postcoloniality as the condition of discourse by such critics as Bhabha, there would appear to be a considerable gap\". Dirlik follows in a similar vein, stressing the postcolonial theorists’ propensity to flatten out cultural difference under the umbrella term of hybridity: \"Africa, Caribbean, South-Asian literatures come from different places and different histories, and not merely different from France, but different from each other. It is this real sort of difference that disappears in postcolonial studies\". In \"Signs of our Time\" Benita Parry discusses \"The Location of Culture\" and criticizes the \"linguistic turn\" in cultural studies, more particularly, Bhabha's dependence on fuzzy psychoanalytical and linguistic explanations of cultural identities, or what she calls the \"autarchy of the signifier\". \"In Postcolonial Studies: a materialist critique,\" she further rails against the \"linguistic turn\" and recommends a materialist postcolonial critique that addresses colonialism's epistemic violence within the wider context of the economic exploitation of the colonized masses by imperial capitalism.\n\nMore recently, Amar Acheraiou in \"Questioning Hybridity, Postcolonialism and Globalization\" challenges Bhabha's theory of hybridity on theoretical as well as ideological and historical grounds. He criticizes Bhabha for examining hybridity from a narrow, \"synchronic\" perspective confined to the 19th century, instead of adopting a \"diachronic\" view which renders better this concept's historical depth. He also reproaches this theorist for stripping the notion of hybridity off its constitutive racial connotations and considers this as an essentialist gesture. According to him, by clearing this concept of its negative biological associations, Bhabha evades the discussion of the problematic issue of race and racism, which should, paradoxically, be a central concern in hybridity theory. He further argues that Bhabha overlooks the fact that there are still today several places across the world where for many biologically hybrids, hybridity or \"the third space\" often proves \"the space of the impossible\" rather than a site of cultural and racial emancipation. The new theory of hybridity that Acheraiou develops in this book departs from the strictly \"cultural and spatial paradigm\" of postcolonial theory, or what he calls \"angelic hybridism.\" It is a broadly historical and multi-layered form of hybridity focused on the nebulous political, economic, and ideological power structures, emancipatory as well as oppressive, which have presided over the discourse and practice of hybridity since the dawn of civilization. He calls this alternative mode of rethinking postcoloniality \"a radical ethics of hybridity,\" which is \"global in scope and planetary in aspiration\". Furthermore, he stresses that this \"resistive planetary hybridity\" is not \"confined to the migrant, diasporic condition,\" and has \"as many centres of consciousness as geographical points of origin\".\n\nThe next phase in the use of the term has been to see hybridity as a cultural effect of globalization. For example, hybridity is presented by Kraidy as the ‘cultural logic’ of globalization as it \"entails that traces of other cultures exist in every culture, thus offering foreign media and marketers transcultural wedges for forging affective links between their commodities and local communities.\" Another promoter of hybridity as globalization is Jan Nederveen Pieterse, who asserts hybridity as the rhizome of culture. He argues that globalization as hybridization opposes views which see the process as homogenizing, modernizing, and westernizing, and that it broadens the empirical history of the concept. However neither of these scholars have reinvigorated the hybridity theory debate in terms of solving its inherent problematics. The term hybridity remains contested precisely because it has resisted the appropriations of numerous discourses despite the fact that it is radically malleable. For example, young Muslims in Indonesia are followers of Islam but have \"synthesized\" trends from global culture in ways that respect religious tradition. These include drinking non-alcoholic beer, using Koranic apps on their iPhones, and buying \"halal\" cosmetics. In anti-Western countries, youth who try to create cultural hybridity through clothing conflict with the traditional views of modesty in their religion. Conflict occurs across generations when older adults clash with youth over youth attempts to change traditions.\n\nLanguages are all hybrid, in varying degrees. For centuries people borrowed from foreign languages, creating thus hybrid linguistic idioms. They did so for commercial, aesthetic, ideological and technological reasons (to facilitate trade transactions, express philosophical or scientific ideas unavailable in their original idioms, enrich and adapt their languages to new realities, subvert a dominant colonial literary canon by deliberately introducing words from the colonized peoples' idiom). Trade and colonization have been the main vehicles of linguistic hybridization across history. Since the classical conquests, both the colonizers and colonized tapped into each other's languages. The Greeks soaked up many mathematical and astronomical concepts from the Egyptians. The Romans, too, absorbed much of Greek culture and ideas. They also drew abundantly from the \"barbarians\". In \"Taktika\", Arrian (92–175 AD), a Greek historian and philosopher of the Roman period, drew attention to the Romans' indebtedness to their colonial subjects, arguing that \"the Romans have many foreign (Iberian, Celtic) terms for formations, for they used Celtic cavalry\". In modern times, the French and British resorted to similar linguistic appropriations throughout their conquests. The French language, for example, contains over 200 Arabic and Berber words, most of which were taken up during France's colonization of Algeria. Similarly, hundreds of Indian words entered the English idiom from the seventeenth to the nineteenth century. According to \"The Oxford English Dictionary,\" 900 English words are of Indian origin. Linguistic hybridity was manifest in these colonial contexts, but was acknowledged by neither the colonizers nor the colonized. More still, while these linguistic borrowings had, de facto, rendered colonial languages hybrid and therefore impure, the myth of linguistic purity and superiority, inherited from the ancient Greeks’ \"linguistic racialism\", held firmly among the European colonizers. The Greek word ‘barbarian,’ which was used to refer to non-Greek languages’ inferiority, backwardness and inarticulacy, was adopted by the French since the 16th century. It was often applied to the Basque, Breton and Occitan languages and to their speakers. Abbé Grégoire recommended wiping out these \"crude idioms\" and forcing French on the Basques, Bretons and Occitans to \"spread enlightened ideas (...), well-being and political tranquillity\". According to him, this would \"banish superstition\" and \"simplify the mechanism of the political machine.\" It would, above all, \"mould the citizens into a national whole\" In Britain, this Aristotelian view of language was revitalized by authors like Jonathan Swift, Samuel Johnson, and Matthew Arnold, who cast respectively the Irish, Scots and Welsh as \"rude\" and \"backward\", attributing these peoples’ intellectual and economic \"backwardness\" to their \"inferior\" languages.\n\nLinguistic and cultural hybridity is a \"dual dynamics\" which operates \"passively\" as well as \"actively\". Mikhail Bakhtin distinguished two types of hybridity: \"organic\" or \"unconscious\" hybridity and \"intentional\" hybridity. He defines organic hybridity as an \"unintentional, unconscious hybridization\" and regards it as \"the most important mode in the historical life and evolution of all languages\". \"Intentional hybridization\" consists of juxtaposing deliberately different idioms, discourses, and perspectives within the same semiotic space without merging them. Bakhtin states that the language of the novel is \"a system of languages that mutually and ideologically interanimate each other\". He adds: \"the novelistic hybrid is an artistically organized system for bringing different languages in contact with one another, a system having as its goal the illumination of one language by another, the carving-out of a living image of another language\". Further down, yet, he cautions against drawing clear-cut boundaries between these two forms of hybridity, arguing that the \"centripetal\" forces inherent in \"organic hybridity\" are also present in \"intentional hybridity,\" in the same way as the \"centrifugal\" features of \"intentional hybridity\" may be at play in \"organic hybridity.\"\n\nLinguistic hybridity and the case of mixed languages challenge the Tree Model in linguistics. For example, \"Israeli\" (a term for Modern Hebrew) has been argued to be a Semito-European hybrid language that \"demonstrates that the reality of linguistic genesis is far more complex than a simple family tree system allows. 'Revived' languages are unlikely to have a single parent.\"\n\nPresently, human beings are immersed in a hybridised environment of reality and augmented reality on a daily basis, considering the proliferation of physical and digital media (i.e. print books vs. e-books, music downloads vs. physical formats). Many people attend performances intending to place a digital recording device between them and the performers, intentionally \"layering a digital reality on top of the real world.\" For artists working with and responding to new technologies, the hybridisation of physical and digital elements has become a reflexive reaction to this strange dichotomy.

{"id": "13014658", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13014658", "title": "Jacobin novel", "text": "Jacobin novel\n\nJacobin novels were written between 1780 and 1805 by British radicals who supported the ideals of the French revolution. The term was coined by literary scholar Gary Kelly in \"The English Jacobin Novel 1780-1805\" (1976) but drawn from the title of the \"Anti-Jacobin: or, Weekly Examiner\", a conservative periodical founded by the Tory politician George Canning. Canning chose to tar British reformers with the French term for the most radical revolutionaries: Jacobin. Among the Jacobin novelists were William Godwin, Robert Bage, Elizabeth Inchbald, and Charlotte Turner Smith. \n\nThe genre began in an attempt to make revolutionary thought more entertaining and easier to comprehend for the lower order. On the midst of the French Revolution, literacy was growing amongst the lower classes, the mass behind the revolutionaries. “A reading public had become a revolutionary public.”\n\nThe Jacobin novelists used this literacy to swell their radical beliefs throughout the lower classes. The Jacobin novelists adapted the romance novel structure into radical political subjects. The Jacobins cleverly blended their revolutionary principles into engaging, fantastical tales of honor, cruelty, and power. The Jacobin novelists were able to reach a massive non-intellectual demographic, which was generally apolitical, through this new genre. \n\nThe Jacobin novel, most quintessentially represented in William Godwin’s Caleb Williams (1794), attacked the established social and political order. Along with William Godwin, some of the major Jacobin novelists include, Elizabeth Inchbald, Thomas Holcroft, and the earliest, Robert Bage. Of all these authors, Godwin was the most effective and outstanding. Almost all of the Jacobin novels reflect theories and principles of Godwin’s Enquiry Concerning Political Justice. Although it is not a novel it is the foundation that the goals of the Jacobin novelists’ are based upon. \n\nIn Godwin’s novel, Caleb Williams, the protagonist is a devoutly honorable man who is cast into a “theater of calamity” by unforeseen circumstances. Throughout Caleb’s entire journey, whenever he comes in contact with any forms of government or institutions of law he is cruelly and wrongfully castigated. Godwin’s novel is an illustration of the effects of an abusive and tyrannical government, it reveals the devastating effects that established power can result in.\n\nThe Jacobin novel was especially significant because its audience was the masses. The Jacobins’ message, although superficially simple, was very complex, and in the opinion of the conservatives, too complex for the lower order to understand. The reactionaries believed that the Jacobin novels were incredibly dangerous because it put ideas of revolution in the minds of those who couldn’t fully understand the concept. The Jacobin novel led to a great anxiety by the government and the middle and upper classes. At one point there was even a suggestion to create a new tax on books in order to discourage literacy among the poor. In order to defend against these revolutionaries another genre was born, the anti-Jacobin novel.\n\nAlthough the Jacobin novelists are contemporarily more popular, the anti-Jacobin novel overtook it across the 1790s and into the early 19th century. The anti-Jacobin novel became immensely popular around the late 1790s (bolstered by the Terror), although they began to appear in the middle of the decade. The genre itself is neither original nor impulsive, without the Jacobin novel it would not exist. \n\nAnti-revolutionaries saw these Jacobin novelists as corrupting the ignorant lower classes by disguising fiction as reason. These reactionaries saw this blend of political thought into the fiction novel as radical, even anarchistic, propaganda that the Jacobins were tricking the non-intellectual lower order into supporting. \n\nIn Thomas James Mathias's \"The Pursuits of Literature\" (1794), he states, “Government and Literature are now more than ever intimately connected.” What Matias goes on to clarify is that in order to defeat the radicals, conservative writers must change their approach in order to capture the audience. To defend King and country, conservatives decided the best way to attack the radicals was through the same medium. The conservatives’ goal became, paradoxically, to take up the fiction that they had denounced and write their own fictional satires of the Jacobin novels, for the same audience. By adopting the Jacobins’ propaganda conveyance, the anti-Jacobins were able to captivate the lower order in the same way but with the opposite message. \n\nAmong dozens of the anti-Jacobin novels, George Walker's \"The Vagabond\" has been called the most effectual. \"The Vagabond\" points to flaws of revolutionary philosophy and suggests it would be disastrous if ever put into practice. The novel includes numerous direct quotations of Godwin's doctrine and illustrates its application, with satirically dreadful results. The book is a blatant attack on Godwin, and the Jacobin novel. \n\nAlong with Walker there were Elizabeth Hamilton, Robert Bisset, Henry James Pye, Charles Lloyd, Jane West, and Edward Dubois. These anti-Jacobin novelists combined history and fiction through satire. Walker clarifies this goal in his dedication of The Vagabond, “Romances are only Histories which we do not believe to be true, and Histories are Romances we do believe to be true.” Although the anti-Jacobins despised the Jacobins’ radical adaptations of the romance structures of the novel, they also realized how effective it could be among the impressionable and naïve lower order. Consequently, the anti-Jacobins decided to fight fire with fire. \n\nIn the anti-Jacobins’ opinions, the Jacobin novelists placed more importance on the romance of the novel than on truth and history. To differentiate themselves from this the anti-Jacobins strove to emphasize truth and historical precedents. Simply put, the goal of the anti-Jacobins was to defeat radicalism by challenging the blend of political treatise and romance while maintaining the importance of truth and history. \n\nThe formula of the anti-Jacobin novel usually includes a satirical interpretation of revolutionaries or revolutionary supporters who accept the power of romance over reason, Jacobin protagonists whose principles are egotistical and/or criminal, verbatim invocations of Godwin’s texts, and a failure of revolutionary philosophy put into place. Many of the novels illustrate the danger of politics in a novel and the susceptibility of the naïve to corruption through the novel. The irony of a novel telling the reader the danger of novels was not missed by the reader and worked to precipitate the relative failure of the genre.\n\n"}

{"id": "39557063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39557063", "title": "Kisra legend", "text": "Kisra legend\n\nThe Kisra legend is a migration story shared by a number of political and ethnic groups in modern Nigeria, Benin, and Cameroon, primarily the Borgu kingdom and the people of the Benue River valley. The migration legend depicts the arrival of a large military force in what is currently Northern Nigeria around the 7th Century AD. The Borgu kingdom claimed direct descent from the leader of this migration and a number of other polities recognize the migration through ceremony and formal regalia. There are a number of different versions of the legend with Kisra sometimes being depicted as a religious and military rival to Muhammad near Mecca around the time that Islam was founded and sometimes as the remnant forces of a Persian king defeated in Egypt. The legend was a key piece of evidence in a number of Hamitic historical theories which argued that the political development of societies in sub-Saharan Africa was the result of contacts with societies from the Middle East (namely Egypt, Rome, and the Byzantine Empire).\n\nThe legend is shared by many different political and ethnic entities throughout what is currently northern Nigeria and has provided important linkages between these communities. Although the different versions share a similar depiction of a large migration into the area along the Niger river in around the 7th Century. Two of the most prominent versions of the story depict Kisra as a challenger to Muhammad on the Arabian peninsula or as a Persian ruler who suffered a military defeat in Egypt. However, in some versions Kisra is not an individual person but a generalized title for the leader of the migration as it moved across Africa. Versions also differ on other aspects of the story, namely whether or not Kisra himself founded any of the royal lines and the specifics of his death or magical disappearance.\n\nIn the most prominent version of the story in the Borgu kingdom, Kisra is depicted as an early political and religious challenger to Muhammad in the area around Mecca. In this version, Kisra was a prominent leader and possessed a number of magical powers. However, during his rule, a seer foresaw that his power would eventually be undermined by a child born within the city who would have divine powers. To prevent this challenge, Kisra exiled all the men of his city on the date that the seer had predicted the baby to be conceived; however, the husband of Aminatu, Kisra's daughter, remained in the city and a son was conceived, Muhammad. As Muhammad grew, he began trying to convert Kisra to Islam, but the ruler resisted. Eventually, this resulted in open warfare between Muhammad and Kisra over religious issues and Kisra won the initial conflict. However, as Muhammad fled to a baobab tree he was provided divine assistance for his escape and to reorganize his forces. Seeing that the tables had turned, Kisra and his followers left the Arabian peninsula, eventually reaching the Niger river. Kisra's party visited many of the villages in the area before eventually founding the Borgu kingdom. In some versions of the legend, Kisra's oldest son Woru (or sometimes Kisra himself) founded the city of Bussa, which would become the capital of Borgu. Kisra's younger sons founded Nikki, founded by Shabi, and Illo, founded by Bio. In later versions, this order of foundation of the main cities of the Borgu kingdom is changed. The legend became crucial in the Borgu kingdom in uniting the different cities, legitimizing the ruling dynasty (the Wasangari), and providing an ideological distinction between Borgu and the Islamic states in the area.\n\nIn 1909, the German anthropologist Leo Frobenius compiled an aggregate version of the Kisra legend from informants in the Benue river valley. This version depicts Kisra not as a challenger to Mohammad, but instead as a Persian king who suffered a military defeat in Egypt to a Byzantine army. Following this defeat, Kisra and his army were unable to return to Persia and had to work further into Africa. His army settled briefly in Nubia and Ethiopia where Kisra joined forces with a powerful king in the region, Napata, to conquer lands to the West. His army migrated into the Niger river region and then followed a similar route as that described above with Kisra's party visiting a number of communities in the area and eventually settling in the Borgu area.\n\nMany communities in the area have some connection to the Kisra migration and the story is used in much of the folklore of the region. However, some cities claim direct connection to the Kisra. These include:\n\nAnthropologists and historians have conducted significant oral histories and material research to identify any correspondence of key parts of the legend. These studies generally agree that a migration into the area did occur around the seventh century. Frobenius argued that the figure of Kisra was possibly the Persian king Khosrau II or Chosroes. Some parts of the historical account do correspond with the timeline of Khosrau II who conquered Egypt in the early 7th century before being defeated by a Byzantine army and it is considered possible that some parts of the army were unable to return to Persia and so journeyed through Africa. Flora Shaw in contrast argued that Kisra was a mistranslation of \"Christ\" and that the migration was largely of Christian origin. C.K. Moss instead contends that Kisra was more likely a Songhai or Mosi king who rose to prominence in the 15th century.\n\nIn summarizing this work, historian Daniel McCall finds that although there is no clear evidence disproving any of these arguments, there are significant problems with all of them, including: the migrating army is said to use armor not used by the Persians at that time, a lack of ecclesiastical historical corroboration, and no Christian or Mithraic symbols came with the migration.\n\nThe Kisra legend is a very important folklore in many of the communities of northern Nigeria. The legend was a key part of developing clear cultural identity in Borgu and Kebbi as they resisted Songhai and Fulani dominance to the north. In addition, the shared Kisra legend facilitated trade and peace treaties between the various ethnic and political communities in the area. Most notably, Borgu and Bornu and Borgu and Kebbi maintained productive trade relations for centuries often facilitated by Kisra traditions of gift exchange. After British control of Nigeria around 1900, administrative change and competition in the new governmental structures led to changes in the legend for each different community.\n\nThe legend played a key role in many (now largely discredited) Hamitic theories of African political and social development. These theories argued that political development, namely the formation of complex states, had its origins in migrations of people from the Middle East or of Christian influences (often Coptic). The Kisra legend, and particularly the hypothesis that Kisra was actually Khosrau II, was seen as clear evidence for Egyptian, Nubian, Byzantine, or Persian influence into the development of West Africa. Without additional historical evidence though the importance of the Kisra legend was often overemphasized.\n\nBooks and Journal Articles\n\nWeb Resources\n"}

It is concerned with matters such as protocol, state visits, investitures, garden parties, the State Opening of Parliament, royal weddings and funerals. For example, in April 2005 it organised the wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales and Camilla Parker Bowles. It is also responsible for authorising use of the Royal Arms.\n\nAs the Lord Chamberlain is a part-time position the day-to-day work of the Office is conducted by the Comptroller of the Lord Chamberlain's Office.\n\n\nThe Lord Chamberlain's Office had a more significant role in British society prior to 1968, as it was the official censor for virtually all theatre performed in Britain. Commercial theatre owners were generally satisfied by the safety this arrangement gave them; so long as they presented only licensed plays they were effectively immune from prosecution for any offence a play might cause. There were campaigns by playwrights, however, in opposition to the Lord Chamberlain's censorship, such as those involving J. M. Barrie in 1909 and 1911. Some plays were not licensed in the 1930s, during the period of appeasement, because they were critical of the German Nazi regime and it was feared that allowing certain plays to be performed might alienate what was still thought of as a friendly government. Lord Cromer, then Lord Chamberlain, regularly consulted the Foreign Office and sometimes, the German Embassy. In the latter case, the submissions were intended to be read by a \"friendly German\".\n\nBy the 1960s, there were many playwrights and producers who wished to produce controversial works such as \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\". Theatre companies such as the Royal Court Theatre came into open conflict with the Lord Chamberlain's Office. Sometimes they would resort to such measures as declaring themselves private clubs for the performance of certain plays. The Lord Chamberlain's Office technically had jurisdiction over private performances, but had generally avoided getting involved with bona-fide private clubs. The various activist groups did not actually come up with solid legal loopholes, but the publicity they generated eventually resulted in the abolition of the role of official censor in the Theatres Act 1968.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "51462", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51462", "title": "Machine", "text": "Machine\n\nA machine (or mechanical device) is a mechanical structure that uses power to apply forces and control movement to perform an intended action. Machines can be driven by animals and people, by natural forces such as wind and water, and by chemical, thermal, or electrical power, and include a system of mechanisms that shape the actuator input to achieve a specific application of output forces and movement. They can also include computers and sensors that monitor performance and plan movement, often called mechanical systems.\n\nRenaissance natural philosophers identified six simple machines which were the elementary devices that put a load into motion, and calculated the ratio of output force to input force, known today as mechanical advantage.\n\nModern machines are complex systems that consist of structural elements, mechanisms and control components and include interfaces for convenient use. Examples include a wide range of vehicles, such as automobiles, boats and airplanes, appliances in the home and office, building air handling and water handling systems, as well as farm machinery, machine tools and factory automation systems and robots.\nThe English word \"machine\" comes through Middle French from Latin \"machina\", which in turn derives from the Greek (Doric , Ionic \"contrivance, machine, engine\", a derivation from \"means, expedient, remedy\"). The word \"mechanical\" (Greek: μηχανικός) comes from the same Greek roots. A wider meaning of \"fabric, structure\" is found in classical Latin, but not in Greek usage. This meaning is found in late medieval French, and is adopted from the French into English in the mid-16th century.\n\nIn the 17th century, the word could also mean a scheme or plot, a meaning now expressed by the derived machination. The modern meaning develops out of specialized application of the term to stage engines used in theater and to military siege engines, both in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. The OED traces the formal, modern meaning to John Harris' \"Lexicon Technicum\" (1704), which has:\n\nThe word \"engine\" used as a (near-)synonym both by Harris and in later language derives ultimately (via Old French) from Latin \"ingenium\" \"ingenuity, an invention\".\n\nThe hand axe, made by chipping flint to form a wedge, in the hands of a human transforms force and movement of the tool into a transverse splitting forces and movement of the workpiece.\n\nThe idea of a \"simple machine\" originated with the Greek philosopher Archimedes around the 3rd century BC, who studied the Archimedean simple machines: lever, pulley, and screw. Archimedes discovered the principle of mechanical advantage in the lever. Later Greek philosophers defined the classic five simple machines (excluding the inclined plane) and were able to roughly calculate their mechanical advantage. Heron of Alexandria (ca. 10–75 AD) in his work \"Mechanics\" lists five mechanisms that can \"set a load in motion\"; lever, windlass, pulley, wedge, and screw, and describes their fabrication and uses. However, the Greeks' understanding was limited to statics (the balance of forces) and did not include dynamics (the tradeoff between force and distance) or the concept of work.\n\nDuring the Renaissance the dynamics of the \"Mechanical Powers\", as the simple machines were called, began to be studied from the standpoint of how much useful work they could perform, leading eventually to the new concept of mechanical work. In 1586 Flemish engineer Simon Stevin derived the mechanical advantage of the inclined plane, and it was included with the other simple machines. The complete dynamic theory of simple machines was worked out by Italian scientist Galileo Galilei in 1600 in \"Le Meccaniche\" (\"On Mechanics\"). He was the first to understand that simple machines do not create energy, they merely transform it.\n\nThe classic rules of sliding friction in machines were discovered by Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), but remained unpublished in his notebooks. They were rediscovered by Guillaume Amontons (1699) and were further developed by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb (1785).\n\nJames Watt patented his parallel motion linkage in 1782, which made the double acting steam engine practical. The Boulton and Watt steam engine and later designs powered steam locomotives, steam ships, and factories.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution was a period from 1750 to 1850 where changes in agriculture, manufacturing, mining, transportation, and technology had a profound effect on the social, economic and cultural conditions of the times. It began in the United Kingdom, then subsequently spread throughout Western Europe, North America, Japan, and eventually the rest of the world.\n\nStarting in the later part of the 18th century, there began a transition in parts of Great Britain's previously manual labour and draft-animal–based economy towards machine-based manufacturing. It started with the mechanisation of the textile industries, the development of iron-making techniques and the increased use of refined coal.\n\nThe idea that a machine can be decomposed into simple movable elements led Archimedes to define the lever, pulley and screw as simple machines. By the time of the Renaissance this list increased to include the wheel and axle, wedge and inclined plane. The modern approach to characterizing machines focusses on the components that allow movement, known as joints.\n\nWedge (hand axe): Perhaps the first example of a device designed to manage power is the hand axe, also see biface and Olorgesailie. A hand axe is made by chipping stone, generally flint, to form a bifacial edge, or wedge. A wedge is a simple machine that transforms lateral force and movement of the tool into a transverse splitting force and movement of the workpiece. The available power is limited by the effort of the person using the tool, but because power is the product of force and movement, the wedge amplifies the force by reducing the movement. This amplification, or mechanical advantage is the ratio of the input speed to output speed. For a wedge this is given by 1/tanα, where α is the tip angle. The faces of a wedge are modeled as straight lines to form a sliding or prismatic joint.\n\nLever: The lever is another important and simple device for managing power. This is a body that pivots on a fulcrum. Because the velocity of a point farther from the pivot is greater than the velocity of a point near the pivot, forces applied far from the pivot are amplified near the pivot by the associated decrease in speed. If \"a\" is the distance from the pivot to the point where the input force is applied and \"b\" is the distance to the point where the output force is applied, then \"a/b\" is the mechanical advantage of the lever. The fulcrum of a lever is modeled as a hinged or revolute joint.\n\nWheel: The wheel is clearly an important early machine, such as the chariot. A wheel uses the law of the lever to reduce the force needed to overcome friction when pulling a load. To see this notice that the friction associated with pulling a load on the ground is approximately the same as the friction in a simple bearing that supports the load on the axle of a wheel. However, the wheel forms a lever that magnifies the pulling force so that it overcomes the frictional resistance in the bearing.\nThe classification of simple machines to provide a strategy for the design of new machines was developed by Franz Reuleaux, who collected and studied over 800 elementary machines. He recognized that the classical simple machines can be separated into the lever, pulley and wheel and axle that are formed by a body rotating about a hinge, and the inclined plane, wedge and screw that are similarly a block sliding on a flat surface.\n\nSimple machines are elementary examples of kinematic chains or linkages that are used to model mechanical systems ranging from the steam engine to robot manipulators. The bearings that form the fulcrum of a lever and that allow the wheel and axle and pulleys to rotate are examples of a kinematic pair called a hinged joint. Similarly, the flat surface of an inclined plane and wedge are examples of the kinematic pair called a sliding joint. The screw is usually identified as its own kinematic pair called a helical joint.\n\nThis realization shows that it is the joints, or the connections that provide movement, that are the primary elements of a machine. Starting with four types of joints, the rotary joint, sliding joint, cam joint and gear joint, and related connections such as cables and belts, it is possible to understand a machine as an assembly of solid parts that connect these joints called a mechanism .\n\nTwo levers, or cranks, are combined into a planar four-bar linkage by attaching a link that connects the output of one crank to the input of another. Additional links can be attached to form a six-bar linkage or in series to form a robot.\n\nA mechanical system manages power to accomplish a task that involves forces and movement. Modern machines are systems consisting of (i) a power source and actuators that generate forces and movement, (ii) a system of mechanisms that shape the actuator input to achieve a specific application of output forces and movement, (iii) a controller with sensors that compare the output to a performance goal and then directs the actuator input, and (iv) an interface to an operator consisting of levers, switches, and displays. \n\nThis can be seen in Watt's steam engine (see the illustration) in which the power is provided by steam expanding to drive the piston. The walking beam, coupler and crank transform the linear movement of the piston into rotation of the output pulley. Finally, the pulley rotation drives the flyball governor which controls the valve for the steam input to the piston cylinder.\n\nThe adjective \"mechanical\" refers to skill in the practical application of an art or science, as well as relating to or caused by movement, physical forces, properties or agents such as is dealt with by mechanics. Similarly Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines \"mechanical\" as relating to machinery or tools.\n\nPower flow through a machine provides a way to understand the performance of devices ranging from levers and gear trains to automobiles and robotic systems. The German mechanician Franz Reuleaux wrote, \"a machine is a combination of resistant bodies so arranged that by their means the mechanical forces of nature can be compelled to do work accompanied by certain determinate motion.\" Notice that forces and motion combine to define power.\n\nMore recently, Uicker et al. stated that a machine is \"a device for applying power or changing its direction.\" McCarthy and Soh describe a machine as a system that \"generally consists of a power source and a mechanism for the controlled use of this power.\"\n\nHuman and animal effort were the original power sources for early machines.\n\nWaterwheel: Waterwheels appeared around the world around 300 BC to use flowing water to generate rotary motion, which was applied to milling grain, and powering lumber, machining and textile operations. Modern water turbines use water flowing through a dam to drive an electric generator.\n\nWindmill: Early windmills captured wind power to generate rotary motion for milling operations. Modern wind turbines also drives a generator. This electricity in turn is used to drive motors forming the actuators of mechanical systems.\n\nEngine: The word engine derives from \"ingenuity\" and originally referred to contrivances that may or may not be physical devices. See Merriam-Webster's definition of engine. A steam engine uses heat to boil water contained in a pressure vessel; the expanding steam drives a piston or a turbine. This principle can be seen in the aeolipile of Hero of Alexandria. This is called an external combustion engine.\n\nAn automobile engine is called an internal combustion engine because it burns fuel (an exothermic chemical reaction) inside a cylinder and uses the expanding gases to drive a piston. A jet engine uses a turbine to compress air which is burned with fuel so that it expands through a nozzle to provide thrust to an aircraft, and so is also an \"internal combustion engine.\" \n\nPower plant: The heat from coal and natural gas combustion in a boiler generates steam that drives a steam turbine to rotate an electric generator. A nuclear power plant uses heat from a nuclear reactor to generate steam and electric power. This power is distributed through a network of transmission lines for industrial and individual use.\n\nMotors: Electric motors use either AC or DC electric current to generate rotational movement. Electric servomotors are the actuators for mechanical systems ranging from robotic systems to modern aircraft.\n\nFluid Power: Hydraulic and pneumatic systems use electrically driven pumps to drive water or air respectively into cylinders to power linear movement.\n\nThe \"mechanism\" of a mechanical system is assembled from components called \"machine elements\". These elements provide structure for the system and control its movement.\n\nThe structural components are, generally, the frame members, bearings, splines, springs, seals, fasteners and covers. The shape, texture and color of covers provide a styling and operational interface between the mechanical system and its users.\n\nThe assemblies that control movement are also called \"mechanisms.\" Mechanisms are generally classified as gears and gear trains, which includes belt drives and chain drives, cam and follower mechanisms, and linkages, though there are other special mechanisms such as clamping linkages, indexing mechanisms, escapements and friction devices such as brakes and clutches.\n\nThe number of degrees of freedom of a mechanism, or its mobility, depends on the number of links and joints and the types of joints used to construct the mechanism. The general mobility of a mechanism is the difference between the unconstrained freedom of the links and the number of constraints imposed by the joints. It is described by the Chebychev-Grübler-Kutzbach criterion.\n\nThe transmission of rotation between contacting toothed wheels can be traced back to the Antikythera mechanism of Greece and the south-pointing chariot of China. Illustrations by the renaissance scientist Georgius Agricola show gear trains with cylindrical teeth. The implementation of the involute tooth yielded a standard gear design that provides a constant speed ratio. Some important features of gears and gear trains are:\n\nA cam and follower is formed by the direct contact of two specially shaped links. The driving link is called the cam (also see cam shaft) and the link that is driven through the direct contact of their surfaces is called the follower. The shape of the contacting surfaces of the cam and follower determines the movement of the mechanism.\n\nA linkage is a collection of links connected by joints. Generally, the links are the structural elements and the joints allow movement. Perhaps the single most useful example is the planar four-bar linkage. However, there are many more special linkages:\n\nA planar mechanism is a mechanical system that is constrained so the trajectories of points in all the bodies of the system lie on planes parallel to a ground plane. The rotational axes of hinged joints that connect the bodies in the system are perpendicular to this ground plane.\n\nA spherical mechanism is a mechanical system in which the bodies move in a way that the trajectories of points in the system lie on concentric spheres. The rotational axes of hinged joints that connect the bodies in the system pass through the center of these circle.\n\nA spatial mechanism is a mechanical system that has at least one body that moves in a way that its point trajectories are general space curves. The rotational axes of hinged joints that connect the bodies in the system form lines in space that do not intersect and have distinct common normals.\n\nA flexure mechanism consists of a series of rigid bodies connected by compliant elements (also known as flexure joints) that is designed to produce a geometrically well-defined motion upon application of a force.\n\nThe elementary mechanical components of a machine are termed machine elements. These elements consist of three basic types (i) \"structural components\" such as frame members, bearings, axles, splines, fasteners, seals, and lubricants, (ii) \"mechanisms\" that control movement in various ways such as gear trains, belt or chain drives, linkages, cam and follower systems, including brakes and clutches, and (iii) \"control components\" such as buttons, switches, indicators, sensors, actuators and computer controllers. While generally not considered to be a machine element, the shape, texture and color of covers are an important part of a machine that provide a styling and operational interface between the mechanical components of a machine and its users.\n\nA number of machine elements provide important structural functions such as the frame, bearings, splines, spring and seals.\n\nControllers combine sensors, logic, and actuators to maintain the performance of components of a machine. Perhaps the best known is the flyball governor for a steam engine. Examples of these devices range from a thermostat that as temperature rises opens a valve to cooling water to speed controllers such as the cruise control system in an automobile. The programmable logic controller replaced relays and specialized control mechanisms with a programmable computer. Servomotors that accurately position a shaft in response to an electrical command are the actuators that make robotic systems possible.\n\nCharles Babbage designed machines to tabulate logarithms and other functions in 1837. His Difference engine can be considered an advanced mechanical calculator and his Analytical Engine a forerunner of the modern computer, though none were built in Babbage's lifetime.\n\nThe Arithmometer and the Comptometer are mechanical computers that are precursors to modern digital computers. Models used to study modern computers are termed State machine and Turing machine.\n\nThe biological molecule myosin reacts to ATP and ADP to alternately engage with an actin filament and change its shape in a way that exerts a force, and then disengage to reset its shape, or conformation. This acts as the molecular drive that causes muscle contraction. Similarly the biological molecule kinesin has two sections that alternately engage and disengage with microtubules causing the molecule to move along the microtubule and transport vesicles within the cell. These molecules are increasingly considered to be nanomachines.\n\nResearchers have used DNA to construct nano-dimensioned four-bar linkages.\n\nMechanization or mechanisation (BE) is providing human operators with machinery that assists them with the muscular requirements of work or displaces muscular work. In some fields, mechanization includes the use of hand tools. In modern usage, such as in engineering or economics, mechanization implies machinery more complex than hand tools and would not include simple devices such as an un-geared horse or donkey mill. Devices that cause speed changes or changes to or from reciprocating to rotary motion, using means such as gears, pulleys or sheaves and belts, shafts, cams and cranks, usually are considered machines. After electrification, when most small machinery was no longer hand powered, mechanization was synonymous with motorized machines.\n\nAutomation is the use of control systems and information technologies to reduce the need for human work in the production of goods and services. In the scope of industrialization, automation is a step beyond mechanization. Whereas mechanization provides human operators with machinery to assist them with the muscular requirements of work, automation greatly decreases the need for human sensory and mental requirements as well. Automation plays an increasingly important role in the world economy and in daily experience.\n\nAn automaton (plural: automata or automatons) is a self-operating machine. The word is sometimes used to describe a robot, more specifically an autonomous robot. A \"Toy Automaton\" was patented in 1863.\n\nUsher reports that Hero of Alexandria's treatise on \"Mechanics\" focussed on the study of lifting heavy weights. Today mechanics refers to the mathematical analysis of the forces and movement of a mechanical system, and consists of the study of the kinematics and dynamics of these systems.\n\nThe dynamic analysis of machines begins with a rigid-body model to determine reactions at the bearings, at which point the elasticity effects are included. The rigid-body dynamics studies the movement of systems of interconnected bodies under the action of external forces. The assumption that the bodies are rigid, which means that they do not deform under the action of applied forces, simplifies the analysis by reducing the parameters that describe the configuration of the system to the translation and rotation of reference frames attached to each body.\n\nThe dynamics of a rigid body system is defined by its equations of motion, which are derived using either Newtons laws of motion or Lagrangian mechanics. The solution of these equations of motion defines how the configuration of the system of rigid bodies changes as a function of time. The formulation and solution of rigid body dynamics is an important tool in the computer simulation of mechanical systems.\n\nThe dynamic analysis of a machine requires the determination of the movement, or kinematics, of its component parts, known as kinematic analysis. The assumption that the system is an assembly of rigid components allows rotational and translational movement to be modeled mathematically as Euclidean, or rigid, transformations. This allows the position, velocity and acceleration of all points in a component to be determined from these properties for a reference point, and the angular position, angular velocity and angular acceleration of the component.\n\nMachine design refers to the procedures and techniques used to address the three phases of a machine's lifecycle:\n\n\n\n"}

Maghe Sankranti is similar to solstice festivals in other religious traditions.\n\nObservant Hindus take ritual baths during this festival, notably at auspicious river locations. These include Sankhamul on the Bagmati near Patan; In the Gandaki/Narayani river basin at Triveni, Devghat near Chitwan Valley and Ridi on the Kaligandaki; and in the Koshi River basin at Dolalghat on the Sun Koshi. Festive foods like laddoo, ghee and sweet potatoes are distributed. The mother of each household wishes good health to all family members.\n\nGenerally makar sankranti falls on 14 January, and is called Makar Sankranti or other names in the Indian subcontinent. Maghe Sankranti is a major harvest festival celebrated in Madhesh and Tharuhat of Nepal. The movement of the sun from one zodiac sign into another is called Sankranti and as the Sun moves into the Capricorn zodiacal sign known as Makara, this occasion is named as Makara Sankranti in the Pahari context. It is one of the few Nepalese festivals of Madhesi and Tharu people that are celebrated on a fixed date, i.e., 14 January because this solar festival in the honor of deity Surya follows the solar cycle of the Bikrami calendar, unlike other festivals that follow lunar cycle.\n\nMaghe Sankranti is regarded as marking the beginning of an auspicious phase in Nepalese culture. It is cited as the 'holy phase of transition'. It marks the end of an inauspicious phase which according to the Hindu calendar begins around mid-December. It is believed that any auspicious and sacred ritual can be sanctified in any Nepali family, this day on-wards. Scientifically, this day marks the beginning of warmer and longer days compared to the nights. In other words, Sankranti marks the termination of winter season and beginning of a new harvest or spring season.\n\nAll over the country, Maghe Sankranti is observed with great fanfares. However, it is celebrated with distinct names and rituals in different parts of the country. In the states of northern and western Nepal, the festival is celebrated as the Makar Sankranti day with special zeal and fervour. The importance of this day has been signified in the ancient epics like Mahabharata. So, apart from socio-geographical importance, Maghe Sankranti holds historical and religious significance. As it is the festival of Sun God, and he is regarded as the symbol of divinity and wisdom, the festival holds an eternal meaning.\n\nMany Nepalese conflate this festival with the Winter Solstice, and believe that the sun ends its southward journey (Sanskrit: \"Dakshinayana\") at the Tropic of Capricorn, and starts moving northward (Sanskrit: \"Uttarayaana\") towards the Tropic of Cancer, in the month of \"Poush\" on this day in mid-January.\n\nWhile there is no overt solar observance of Winter Solstice in the Nepali religion, the Vaikuntha Ekadashi festival, calculated on the lunar calendar, falls the closest. Further, the Sun makes its northward journey on the day after winter solstice when day light increases. Therefore, Makar Sankranti signifies the celebration of the day following the day of winter solstice.\n\nScientifically, currently in the Northern Hemisphere, winter solstice occurs between 21 and 22 December. Day light will begin to increase on 22 December and on this day, the Sun will begin its northward journey which marks \"Uttarayaan\". The date of winter solstice changes gradually due to the Axial precession of the Earth, coming earlier by approximately 1 day in every 70 years. Hence, if the Maghe Sankranti at some point of time did mark the day after the actual date of winter solstice, a date in mid-January would correspond to around 300CE, the heyday of English mathematics and astronomy.\n\n"}

It was so named because Knight, Judith Merril, and James Blish lived in Milford, Pennsylvania when it was founded. It moved to the United Kingdom in 1972 and has run successfully ever since on an annual basis.\n\nJudith Merril, James Blish, and Damon Knight founded the Milford Writer's Conference in 1956. It is both a residential workshop and a writers' conference in which published science fiction writers convene over the course of a week to intensively critique stories and samples from novels (usually works in progress) and to workshop ideas on all aspects of SF writing. It is a peer-to-peer conference with no teachers or students.\n\nMilford and related entities like \"Science Fiction Forum\" presaged the creation of the Science Fiction Writers of America in 1965 and that decade's New Wave movement. In 1972, Blish set up the United Kingdom Milford SF Writers' Conference, which initially met in Milford on Sea, Hampshire. Since then it has been held in various locations, latterly Devon until 2001, York in 2002 and 2003, and (since 2004) at Trigonos Conference Centre in North Wales, usually in mid September.\n\nAn honorary committee is elected annually at the AGM held during the Milford week. The 2015 committee (elected 2014) comprised: Sue Thomason (Chair), Liz Williams (Secretary), Tina Anghelatos (Treasurer), Jacey Bedford (Vice-Chair, Website and Mailing Lists), Kari Sperring, and Karen Williams. Committee members are listed on the workshop's official web site.\n\nParticipants must have sold at least one science fiction story to qualify for attendance, and relative newcomers to publication are welcomed, though participants often have multiple novel and/or short story sales to their credit. Qualification details are quoted on the workshop's official website.\n\nWorkshop participants in the United States (pre-1972) included:\n\nMilford is the model for other peer-to-peer science fiction writer workshops, including the Turkey City Writer's Workshop, the Clarion Workshop and the Clarion West Writers Workshop. \n\nParticipants in the UK (in 1972 and afterward) have included:\n\nA full list of former Milford participants is listed on the workshop's official website.\n\nManuscripts are distributed beforehand. Everyone reads, critiques, and prepares before the formal workshop begins. Etiquette precludes participants from discussing the manuscripts beforehand either with the author or other members of the critique group. The participants sit round in a circle. The author whose work is being critiqued has to sit in silence through the first part in which each participant in turn is allowed an uninterrupted four minutes (timed) to deliver their critique. Then the author gets an uninterrupted right to reply. Following that a general discussion ensues. Constructive criticism is strongly encouraged. In the last few years it has become accepted for the critiqued manuscripts to be given back to the author complete with notes.\n\nThe so-called \"Milford method\" has been adopted by several writers' groups, including the Glasgow Science Fiction Writers Circle.\n\n"}

Throughout the game, two sets of playable characters can be swapped with on the fly, each boasting their own unique attacks and abilities (the characters at hand depend on the given stage). Throughout the game, players will earn yellow orbs, which act as a form of currency. These orbs may be exchanged for new combat moves and gear.\n\nPlayers will battle a variety of enemies, mainly zombies, werewolves, ghouls and demons. In order to defeat these foes, weapons such as swords, chainsaws, and guns are available. Slaying enemies will result in the dismemberment of limbs, as well as an in-game combo.\n\nAfter completing a level, the user is graded on their performance throughout the stage. Factors such as combo length, amount of items used, damage dealt and damage received can all affect this score in a positive and negative manner. These scores can also be submitted to the worldwide leader boards.\n\nThe Banefuls and the Vampirics are two ancient rival demonic bloodlines. After the numbers of both factions dwindled to almost nothing it was thought that the blood feud was over, until now.\n\nAfter the Vampiric sisters Kagura and Saaya defeated their treacherous adoptive mother, the Vampire Queen Carmilla, at the end of the last game, aided from the shadows by Aya and Saki, two legendary zombie-hunting sisters of Baneful blood, the truce came to an abrupt end and the two sets of sisters could restrain themselves no longer.\n\nCarmilla's throne room became a battleground once again as the two pairs of sisters battled for supremacy. The battle, however, was undecided, as the floor beneath them collapsed sending the four into the abyss below, but not before glancing a mysterious, slender, green-haired woman now sitting in Carmilla's throne.\n\nThe girls become separated from their respective sisters and are pushed into uneasy alliances for survival. In the catacombs beneath the castle, Kagura is forced to drink Aya's blood in order to regenerate after she is critically injured by demonic moles being kept in the castle's depths. The fusion of the two bloodlines within Kagura's body allows her to temporarily transform into a powerful new form, Dare Drive, slaying all who stand before her.\n\nSaaya and Saki are thrust into a pocket hell-dimension but are able to escape by co-operating to defeat the waves of undead blocking their exit. They escape to the castle village but are attacked by a masked undead assassin known as Misha. Misha bests the girls and seriously injures Saaya. Kagura and Aya reunite with them and advise Saaya to feed on Saki's blood in order to recover and transform into her own Dare Drive. This works, and the four girls work together to force Misha to retreat and slay her undead entourage.\n\nNow working together, the girls are advised by their friend Anna of the Zombie Prevention Force (ZPF) to wipe out several zombie outbreaks around the world and eliminate several high-profile targets. The attacks are revealed to be diversions to keep the girls at bay whilst Misha locates the ZPF Headquarters and slaughters and zombifies the personnel within. Fortunately, being a field operative, Anna is absent and evades the attack.\n\nThe four girls arrive at the scene where the results of Kagura and Saaya's vampiric bites finally take their effects on Aya and Saki's Baneful bodies, granting them similar transformations known as Xtatics. The four cut their way through floor after floor of zombified ZPF whilst chasing Misha. On the rooftop, the green-haired woman escapes by helicopter, leaving the party to battle Misha. With their enhanced abilities, the girls are able to defeat Misha once and for all.\n\nThe mortally wounded Misha falls from the rooftop as her mask shatters, revealing that she was in fact Misery, a rival Baneful and loose ally of Aya and Saki's late nemesis, Himiko. Misery was slain a year previously by Aya and Saki to end her insane bloodlust, and was subsequently resurrected by the green-haired woman.\n\nAnna contacts the party with news that the green-haired woman has returned to Carmilla's castle. The girls follow, and attempt the evade the awaiting zombie army by navigating a network of underground tunnels. Despite many traps set for them, the girls successfully confront the green-haired woman in the now restored throne room.\n\nThe woman identifies herself as Evangeline, or 'Evange' for short, and reveals her goal of creating a world for both the Banefuls and Vampirics; a world she aims to create by fusing the bloodlines, much like the party did previously. Evange offers the girls a place in her utopia, but soon withdraws her offer when she realizes the girls still intend to kill her. Evange attacks the party, using her own fused blood to transform, but the party emerges victorious and slays her.\n\nThe girls agree to put the ancient blood feud behind them and make their alliance permanent. Later, Anna contacts the girls and reveals Evange's origins. Evange was a researcher working for Carmilla who used the castle's facilities to further her own cause.

MacGregor praised the game's combat, character designs, and sexual fan service, while taking issue to the \"linear and repetitive mission structure\", and also disliking the enemy AI, commenting that they simply rely on sheer size to pose any sort of challenge.\n\nHardcore Gamer's Adam Beck was highly critical of the game. Despite giving applause to the high level of customization and fluid swordplay, he felt the poor dialog, bad mission structure, repetitive combat and short game length brought the game experience down, awarding the game a 4/10. He did however call \"Onechanbara Z2: Chaos\" one of the better entries in the series.\n\nPenny Arcade featured the game in a \"First 15\" video feature, and found little to like. The \"First 15\" segments feature writer Jerry Holkins and artist Mike Krahulik playing a game for fifteen minutes, and provide a record of their reactions and reflections on the game being played. Holkins and Krahulik were uniformly negative, citing feelings of disgust while playing. They criticized the character modeling of the enemies, the costumes of the protagonists, the gameplay, and the spirit of the game. Unaware that the game was part of a franchise, and clearly unfamiliar with the more sexually liberated media of Japan, Krahulik wondered what audience the game was meant to appeal to, implying that the game could not possibly sell well.\n\nMatt Sainsbury, reviewing for DigitallyDownloaded.net, gave the game a 9/10, saying that while technical bugs existed, such as a sometimes poor camera, they never detracted from the fast paced combat.\n\n"}

They are not manufactured, transported or stocked.\n\nServices cannot be stored for a future use. They are produced and consumed simultaneously.\n\nServices are perishable in two regards:\nThe service provider must deliver the service at the time of service consumption. The service is not manifested in a physical object that is independent of the provider. The service consumer is also inseparable from service delivery. Examples: The service consumer must sit in the hairdresser's chair, or in the airplane seat. Correspondingly, the hairdresser or the pilot must be in the shop or plane, respectively, to deliver the service.\n\nEach service is unique. It can never be exactly repeated as the time, location, circumstances, conditions, current configurations and/or as signed resources are different for the next delivery, even if the same service consumer requests the same service. Many services are regarded as heterogeneous and are typically modified for each service consumer or each service contextual . Example: The taxi service which transports the service consumer from home to work is different from the taxi service which transports the same service consumer from work to home – another point in time, the other direction, possibly another route, probably another taxi driver and cab. Another and more common term for this is heterogeneity.\n\nBoth service provider and service consumer participate in the service providers\n\nMass generation and delivery of services must be mastered for a service provider to expand. This can be seen as a problem of service quality. Both inputs and outputs to the processes involved providing services are highly variable, as are the relationships between these processes, making it difficult to maintain consistent service quality. Many services involve variable human activity, rather than a precisely determined process; exceptions include utilities. The human factor is often the key success factor in service provision. Demand can vary by season, time of day, business cycle, etc. Consistency is necessary to create enduring business relationships.\n\nAny service can be clearly and completely, consistently and concisely specified by means of standard attributes that conform to the MECE principle (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive).\n\n\nThe delivery of a service typically involves six factors:\n\nThe service encounter is defined as all activities involved in the service delivery process. Some service managers use the term \"moment of truth\" to indicate that point in a service encounter where interactions are most intense.\n\nMany business theorists view service provision as a performance or act (sometimes humorously referred to as \"dramalurgy\", perhaps in reference to dramaturgy). The location of the service delivery is referred to as the stage and the objects that facilitate the service process are called props. A script is a sequence of behaviors followed by those involved, including the client(s). Some service dramas are tightly scripted, others are more ad lib. Role congruence occurs when each actor follows a script that harmonizes with the roles played by the other actors.\n\nIn some service industries, especially health care, dispute resolution and social services, a popular concept is the idea of the caseload, which refers to the total number of patients, clients, litigants, or claimants for which a given employee is responsible. Employees must balance the needs of each individual case against the needs of all other current cases as well as their own needs.\n\nUnder English law, if a service provider is induced to deliver services to a dishonest client by a deception, this is an offence under the Theft Act 1978.\n\nLovelock used the number of delivery sites (whether single or multiple) and the method of delivery to classify services in a 2 x 3 matrix. Then implications are that the convenience of receiving the service is the lowest when the customer has to come to the service and must use a single or specific outlet. Convenience increases (to a point) as the number of service points increase.\n\nThe distinction between a good and a service remains disputed. The perspective in the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries focused on creation and possession of wealth. Classical economists contended that goods were objects of value over which ownership rights could be established and exchanged. Ownership implied tangible possession of an object that had been acquired through purchase, barter or gift from the producer or previous owner and was legally identifiable as the property of the current owner.\n\nAdam Smith’s famous book, \"The Wealth of Nations\", published in 1776, distinguished between the outputs of what he termed \"productive\" and \"unproductive\" labor. The former, he stated, produced goods that could be stored after production and subsequently exchanged for money or other items of value. The latter, however useful or necessary, created services that perished at the time of production and therefore did not contribute to wealth. Building on this theme, French economist Jean-Baptiste Say argued that production and consumption were inseparable in services, coining the term \"immaterial products\" to describe them.\n\nMost modern business theorists describe a continuum with pure service on one terminal point and pure commodity good on the other. Most products fall between these two extremes. For example, a restaurant provides a physical good (the food), but also provides services in the form of ambience, the setting and clearing of the table, etc. And although some utilities actually deliver physical goods — like water utilities that deliver water — utilities are usually treated as services.\n\nIn a narrower sense, service refers to quality of customer service: the measured appropriateness of assistance and support provided to a customer. This particular usage occurs frequently in retailing.\n\nThe following is a list of service industries, grouped into sectors. Parenthetical notations indicate how specific occupations and organizations can be regarded as service industries to the extent they provide an intangible service, as opposed to a tangible good.\n\n\nBelow is a list of countries by service output at market exchange rates in 2016.\n\n"}

{"id": "1853101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1853101", "title": "Tetrabiblos", "text": "Tetrabiblos\n\nTetrabiblos () 'four books', also known in Greek as Apotelesmatiká () \"Effects\", and in Latin as Quadripartitum \"Four Parts\", is a text on the philosophy and practice of astrology, written in the 2nd century AD by the Alexandrian scholar Claudius Ptolemy ( AD 90– AD 168).\n\nPtolemy's \"Almagest\" was an authoritative text on astronomy for more than a thousand years, and the \"Tetrabiblos\", its companion volume, was equally influential in astrology, the study of the effects of astronomical cycles on earthly matters. But whilst the \"Almagest\" as an astronomical authority was superseded by acceptance of the heliocentric model of the solar system, the \"Tetrabiblos\" remains an important theoretical work for astrology.\n\nBesides outlining the techniques of astrological practice, Ptolemy's philosophical defense of the subject as a natural, beneficial study helped secure theological tolerance towards astrology in Western Europe during the Medieval era. This allowed Ptolemaic teachings on astrology to be included in universities during the Renaissance, which brought an associated impact upon medical studies and literary works.\nThe historical importance of the \"Tetrabiblos\" is seen by the many ancient, Medieval and Renaissance commentaries that have been published about it. It was copied, commented on, paraphrased, abridged, and translated into many languages. The latest critical Greek edition, by Wolfgang Hübner, was published by Teubner in 1998.\n\nPtolemy is referred to as \"the most famous of Greek astrologers\" and \"a pro-astrological authority of the highest magnitude\". As a source of reference his \"Tetrabiblos\" is described as having \"enjoyed almost the authority of a Bible among the astrological writers of a thousand years or more\". Compiled in Alexandria in the 2nd century, the work gathered commentaries about it from its first publication. It was translated into Arabic in the 9th century, and is described as \"by far the most influential source of medieval Islamic astrology\".\n\nWith the translation of the \"Tetrabiblos\" into Latin in the 12th century, \"Ptolemaic astrology\" became integrated by Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas into medieval Christian doctrine. This theological acceptance encouraged the teaching of Ptolemaic astrology in universities, often linked to medical studies. This, in turn, brought attention in literary works, such as Dante's, which helped shape the moral, religious and cosmological paradigm of Western Europe during the Medieval era. The \"Tetrabiblos\" was largely responsible for laying down the basic precepts of Renaissance astrology, and was a necessary textbook in some of the finest universities of Renaissance and early modern Europe. \n\nPtolemaic astrology continued to be taught at European universities into the 17th century, but by the mid-17th century the study struggled to maintain its position as one of the respected Liberal sciences. At this time, the contents of the \"Tetrabiblos\" started to draw stigmatisation as part of \"a diabolical art of divination\". One 17th-century critic was to write of its subject: \"no superstitious art is more fitted to forward the aims of the devil than the astrology of Ptolemy\".\n\nThe intellectual standing of astrology collapsed rapidly at the end of the 17th century, but the historical impact of the \"Tetrabiblos\" upon world culture continues to engage the attention of scholars of classical philosophy and the history of sciences in antiquity. It also maintains its position as an influential textbook for practitioners of modern western astrology, and English translations of the text were published by astrologers in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. The early 20th-century Humanist astrologer Dane Rudhyar reported that the astrology of his era \"originated almost entirely in the work of the Alexandrian astrologer, Claudius Ptolemy\". Even 21st-century astrological textbooks have described the \"Tetrabiblos\" as being \"without a doubt, indispensable for any serious student of astrology\".\n\nThe work's enduring significance is attributed to several factors: Ptolemy's reputation as one of the greatest philosophers and scientists of the ancient world, the text's astrological importance as one of the oldest complete manuals on that subject, and the unprecedented order and quality of Ptolemy's astrological explanations.\n\nThe \"outstanding mark of Ptolemy’s astrology\" is described as \"informed by the philosophical and scientific spirit of his age\". Ptolemy wrote at a time when \"physics\" was defined by philosophy, and his account of stellar effects was expressed in terms of the four Aristotelian qualities (hot, cold, wet, and dry) set against the philosophical notion of universal unity and cosmic harmony. His objective was to explain the rationale of astrology in such terms, so the work is also notable for its dismissal of astrological practices which lack a direct astronomical basis:\n\nThe book opens with an explanation of the philosophical framework of astrology which aims to answer the arguments of critics who questioned the subject's validity. Of this, Lynn Thorndike, in his \"History of Magic and Experimental Science\", writes: \"Only the opponents of astrology appear to have remained ignorant of the \"Tetrabiblos\", continuing to make criticisms of the art which do not apply to Ptolemy's presentation of it or which had been specifically answered by him\".\n\nPtolemy was not responsible for originating the astrological techniques he presented in the \"Tetrabiblos\". His contribution was to arrange the material systematically, in order to demonstrate that astrology is based upon logical, hierarchical principles. Astrological influences are frequently referred to the meteorological effects of humoral shifts, which were presumed to result from celestial cycles bringing correlated changes in the heating, cooling, moistening, and drying affects of the atmosphere.\n\nThe historical importance and influence of the \"Tetrabiblos\" is attested by the many ancient, Medieval and Renaissance commentaries published about it, as well as the many translations and paraphrased editions that aim to reproduce its content in an accessible manner. The Greek text has undergone transmission into Arabic, Latin and many modern languages. The first English translation did not appear until the 18th century, but by the end of the 19th century the American astrologer Luke Broughton reported he had at least half a dozen different English translations in his possession.\n\nThe commonly known Greek and Latin titles (\"Tetrabiblos\" and \"Quadripartitum\" respectively), meaning 'four books', are traditional nicknames for a work which in some Greek manuscripts is entitled , 'Mathematical treatise in four books'. Frank Eggleston Robbins, editor of the Loeb English translation published in 1940, considered it likely that this was the title used by Ptolemy himself, although he acknowledged that many other Greek manuscripts use the title , 'The prognostics addressed to Syrus'. An ancient anonymous commentary on the work states that some considered the term \"Tetrabiblos\" to be a fictitious name.\n\nHübner, editor of the 1998 Teubner Greek edition, uses the title \"Apotelesmatiká\" (\"biblía\"), '(books on) effects', which has been followed by recent scholars. Alexander Jones, editor of the Springer publication \"Ptolemy in Perspective\" (2010) considers that Ptolemy's own title remains unknown, but agrees that the term \"Apotelesmatika\" is \"a credible guess\". This term is variously translated to mean 'influences', 'effects' or 'prognostics'; reflecting the theme of work, which is concerned with gaining foreknowledge of the effects of predictable astronomical cycles.\n\nThere is no firmly established date for the compilation of the \"Tetrabiblos\" but Ptolemy discloses in his 'Introductory Address' that he wrote his astrological treatise after completing his astronomical one: the \"Almagest\". Evidence within the \"Almagest\" reveals that the astronomical work could not have been completed before about 145 AD, which demonstrates that Ptolemy wrote the \"Tetrabiblos\" towards the end of his life, sometime between completing the \"Almagest\" and his death, generally reported to be around 168 A.D.\n\nThe text begins with Ptolemy's address to \"Syrus\", an unidentified character to whom all Ptolemy's works are dedicated. In this Ptolemy differentiates between two types of astronomical study: the first (astronomy proper) which discovers the astronomical cycles and movements; the second (astrology) which investigates the changes these movements bring about. He states that each has its own science and the former is desirable in its own right \"even though it does not attain the result given by its combination with the second\". This is taken to demonstrate Ptolemy's view that astronomy and astrology are complementary studies, so that whilst astrology is less self-sufficient and factual, its employment makes the practice of astronomy more useful. Although the terms \"astronomia\" and \"astrologia\" were used interchangeably in ancient texts, this also demonstrates the early definition of two differentiated subjects which were discussed at length by Ptolemy in two separate works.\n\nPtolemy states that having dealt with the former subject (astronomy) in its own treatise, he \"shall now give an account of the second and less self-sufficient method in a properly philosophical way, so that one whose aim is the truth might never compare its perceptions with the sureness of the first\". In this, and further introductory remarks, he reveals his view that astrological prediction is extremely difficult and easily subject to error, but satisfactorily attainable to those who possess the necessary skill and experience, and of too much benefit to be dismissed simply because it can sometimes be mistaken.\n\nChapters 2 and 3 are important for giving Ptolemy's philosophical defense of his subject. Franz Boll noticed the arguments were paralleled in older sources, particularly those of the Stoic philosopher Posidonius (135 BCE–AD 51 BCE). Equally, Ptolemy's narrative was drawn upon by later philosophers and astronomers, such as Johannes Kepler who used similar examples and the same order of arguments to explain the physical foundation of some astrological claims. Described as \"scientifically speaking, perfectly laudable\" by one modern commentator, another has condemned these chapters as the place where Ptolemy's \"knowledge, intelligence and rhetorical skill\" are most \"misused\".\n\nIn chapter one Ptolemy asserts the legitimacy of the study and identifies the two main arguments set against it: \nPtolemy then answers each criticism in the following two chapters.\n\nIn chapter two Ptolemy maintains that knowledge gained by astronomical means is attainable and he attempts to define its limits according to \"Aristotelian-Stoic\" logic. He points out how the Sun has the greatest influence upon the Earth’s seasonal and daily cycles, and that most things in nature are synchronised by the Moon:\n\nHe extends this ability to stir the weather and steer the biological patterns of earthly creatures to the fixed stars and planets, so that everything which experiences cycles of growth, or patterns of behaviour, is in some way responsive to the celestial cycles. These bring about elemental changes (hot, windy, snowy or watery conditions, \"etc\"): led by the Sun, activated by the Moon and aided by the planetary configurations and the fixed stars' phenomena. The prevailing meteorological qualities are then considered to determine the temperament – the quality of the moment of time at a specific place - which is presumed to be impressed, as a sort of temporal imprint, upon the seed of anything which comes into germination or manifestation at that moment in time. Ptolemy admits that successful analysis of this temperament is not easily attained but is capable of being determined by someone who is able to regard the data “both scientifically and by successful conjecture”. He questions why, if a person can reliably predict the general weather patterns and their effects upon agricultural seeds and animals from the knowledge of the celestial cycles: \n\nWhilst suggesting that such arguments are enough to demonstrate the validity of astrology, Ptolemy accepts that many mistakes are made in its practice - partly because of \"evident rascals\" who profess to practice it without due knowledge and pretend to foretell things which cannot be naturally known (sometimes using the term 'astrology' for practices which are not true to the genuine study of astrology) and because legitimate practitioners must acquire a magnitude of knowledge and experience within a limited life-span. His summary is that the study is usually only able to give reliable knowledge in general terms; that astrological advice should be welcomed but not expected to be faultless; and that the astrologer should not be criticised but encouraged to integrate non-celestial information within the compilation of a judgement (such as what is known of an individual’s ethnic background, nationality and parental influences).\n\nIn chapter three Ptolemy argues that astrological prediction is both natural and beneficial. The translation of these ideas into Latin in the 12th century are described as being \"of critical importance\" to the adoption of a favourable attitude towards astrology within Christianity in the Medieval period.\nPtolemy first proposes that it is not \"useless\" to create predictions of what is likely to happen, even if the predictions do not provide the means to avoid impending disaster. This was one of the well known classical criticisms that had been brought to prominence in Cicero's text \"De Divinatione\", in the argument that no good comes from warnings of imminent disasters when they offer no means of escape. Ptolemy gives a more positive view of divination in his assessment of astrology as a subject \"by which we gain full view of things human and divine\", which, he argues, gives a better perception of \"what is fitting and expedient for the capabilities of each temperament\". He views astrology as a subject which encourages enhanced self-knowledge, to be valued as a source of pleasure and well-being; since even if astrology cannot aid in the acquisition of riches or fame; the same can be said of all philosophy, which concerns itself with \"greater advantages\". Hence, in the case of unfortunate events that will necessarily take place, Ptolemy asserts that astrological prediction still brings benefits, because \"foreknowledge accustoms and calms the soul by experience of distant events as though they were present, and prepares it to greet with calm and steadiness whatever comes\".\n\nPtolemy's next argument was to avoid the criticisms that arise when the practice of prediction is seen to suggest fatal necessity. This point was crucial to later theological acceptance, since Medieval religious doctrine dictates that the individual soul must possess free will, in order to be responsible for its own choices and the consequences that flow from them. Gerard of Feltre's 13th-century text \"Summa on the Stars\" demonstrates the problem that astrological determinism creates for the theological argument: \"If the stars make a man a murderer or a thief, then all the more it is the first cause, God, who does this, which it is shameful to suggest\". Ptolemy's comments counter the criticism by proposing that whilst the celestial cycles are entirely reliable and \"eternally performed in accordance with divine, unchangeable destiny\", all earthly things are also subject to \"a natural and mutable fate, and in drawing its first causes from above it is governed by chance and natural sequence\". He therefore declares that nothing is irrevocably ordained, and we are not to imagine that \"events attend mankind as the result of the heavenly cause as if … destined to take place by necessity without the possibility of any other cause whatever interfering\".\n\nIn this discussion Ptolemy makes a point that was to be called upon by many later astrological writers, that \"the lesser cause always yields to the stronger\". He sees an individual as unable to resist the greater cycles of change which happen to the wider community, so even a man whose horoscope indicates gain may perish at a time that his community is struck by natural disaster or pestilence. However, Ptolemy also maintains that disastrous events will only follow a natural course if no counter action is taken to avert the problem, as when \"future happenings to men are not known, or if they are known and the remedies are not applied\". He takes a balanced position in the argument of fate versus free will in writing that certain things, because their effective causes are numerous, become inevitable, whilst others are able to be averted by the act of astrological prediction. The astrologer's position is compared to that of the physician, who must be able to recognise beforehand which ailments are always fatal, and which admit of aid.\n\nIt is therefore reasonable, in Ptolemy's estimation, to moderate actions with awareness of how the prevailing and future temperament prospers or injures the natal temperament, or to elect to act at a time that is astrologically suitable to the activity – just as it is deemed rational to use knowledge of the stars to ensure safety at sea; to use knowledge of the lunar cycle to ensure successful breeding and sowing, or to cool ourselves against the extremes of temperature in order that we suffer less.\n\nPtolemy's philosophical conclusion on the subject, which helped to secure its intellectual standing until the 18th century, is thus: \"even if it be not entirely infallible, at least its possibilities have appeared worthy of the highest regard\". Having justified his intellectual involvement in the study, according to the philosophical principles of his day, Ptolemy then turns his attention to the practical theory of astrology, and the rationale that lies behind the arrangement of its principles.\n\nOne of the unique features of the \"Tetrabiblos\", amongst the astrological texts of its period, is the extent to which the first book not only introduces the basic astrological principles, but synthesises and explains the reasoning behind their reported associations in line with Aristotelian philosophy. Chapter four, for example, explains the \"power of the planets\" through their associations with the creative humoral qualities of warmth or moisture, or the reductive qualities of cold and dryness. Hence Mars is described as a destructive planet because its humoral association is excessive dryness, whilst Jupiter is defined as temperate and fertilising because its association is moderate warmth and humidity. These associations are based on the arrangements of the planets with regard to the Sun, as perceived from the geocentric perspective, by which their orbits are measured is if they are centred upon the Earth.\n\nUniting these Aristotelian principles with a prevalent Greek philosophy employed by Zeno of Citium and the Pythagoreans, the next three chapters arrange the planets into pairs of opposites. They may be benefic (moderately warming or moistening) or malefic (excessively cooling or drying); masculine (drying) or feminine (moistening); active and diurnal (suited to the qualities of the day and aligned with the nature of the Sun) or passive and nocturnal (suited to the qualities of the night and aligned with the nature of the Moon). Since these humoral associations derive from configurations with the Sun, chapter eight describes how they are subtly modified according to the phase of each planet’s synodic cycle with the Sun.\n\nChapter nine discusses the \"power of the fixed stars\". Here, rather than give direct humoral associations, Ptolemy describes their \"temperatures\" as being like that of the planets he has already defined. Hence Aldebaran (\"called the Torch\") is described as having \"a temperature like that of Mars\", whilst other stars in the Hyades are \"like that of Saturn and moderately like that of Mercury\". At the end of the chapter Ptolemy clarifies that these are not his proposals, but are drawn from historical sources, being \"the observations of the effects of the stars themselves as made by our predecessors\".\n\nChapter ten returns to the humoral theme more explicitly, clarifying that the zodiac is aligned to the seasons and so expressive of the shifting emphasis through moisture, warmth, dryness and cold, (as brought about by spring, summer, autumn, and winter). Similarly, the four angles of the chart present an humoral emphasis through association with the effects of the four cardinal winds that blow from their aligned directions. The remainder of book one (up to the final two chapters which concern the planetary phases and aspectual applications), presents the rulerships, divisions, and configurations of the zodiac signs, most of which are related to astronomical definitions, seasonal effects, physics and geometry. Geometrical principles are used to define the favourable or unfavourable quality of astrological aspects, based on the angular relationship of planets and signs with ecliptic degrees.\n\nIn Ptolemy’s era the boundaries of the zodiac signs were close to those of the visible constellations whose names they bear, but Ptolemy demonstrates the theoretical distinction between the two frames of reference in describing the starting point of the zodiac as fixed, not to the stars, but to the mathematically calculated vernal equinox. This determines the seasonally based tropical zodiac which takes its name from the Greek word τροπικός \"tropikos\": ‘of the turning’, because it is set by the turn of the seasons and, being subject to precession, experiences a slow and gradual revolution through the visible constellations. For the same reason, the signs that mark the Sun’s summer and winter solstice points (Cancer and Capricorn) are described as the 'tropical signs', since these are the places where the Sun 'turns' its direction in celestial latitude, (thereby defining the terrestrial circles of latitude known as the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn).\n\nWhereas other ancient astrological writers gave their emphasis to the astrological interpretation of such definitions (for example, in describing how tropical signs are indicative of quickly changing situations), Ptolemy's focus is notably different; given to the astronomical and philosophical factors that underlie the definitions rather than their astrological meaning in practice. Ptolemy explains that the definitions of the zodiac are not his own, but present \"the natural characters of the zodiacal signs, as they have been handed down by tradition\". His approach finds elegant expression where he is demonstrating the logic of schematic arrangements (such as the philosophical principles behind the planetary rulership of signs), but is noted to convey detachment in regard to the elements of astrology that are not so obviously plausible. This can be seen in the way that Ptolemy avoids going into detail on the facets of astrology that rely on mythological, or symbolic associations, and how he is willing to outline the reasoning behind conflicting astrological proposals without revealing any personal preference for one scheme over another.\n\nSome commentators have viewed Ptolemy's comparatively dispassionate approach towards points of astrological contention as reason to suppose he was more interested in the theoretical principles than the actual practice of astrology. On the other hand, the objective tone that marks his style; his assertion that the subject is natural (by which he makes no demand for oaths of secrecy from its students as some contemporaries do); and the way he shows respectful reference to alternative views without vilifying authors whose practices might differ from his own, all helped to secure the text’s historical reputation as an intellectually superior one. Classics scholar Mark Riley raised these points in his assessment that Ptolemy approached the subject of astrology with exactly the same theoretical inclination that he applied to astronomy, geography and the other sciences on which he wrote. This distinctive style of approach led Riley to conclude: \"The respect shown to Ptolemy’s work by all later astrologers was due, not to its usefulness to the practitioner, but to his magisterial synthesis of astrology and science\".\nBook II presents Ptolemy's treatise on mundane astrology. This offers a comprehensive review of ethnic stereotypes, eclipses, significations of comets and seasonal lunations, as used in the prediction of national economics, wars, epidemics, natural disasters and weather patterns. No other surviving ancient text offers a comparable account of this topic, in terms of the breadth and depth of detail offered by Ptolemy. Although no demonstrated examples are given, he writes with authority in this branch of his subject, which suggests it was of particular interest to him. Modern commentators have remarked that Ptolemy was \"consciously taking a different approach\" to contrast \"with the 'old', infinitely complicated methods\".\n\nPtolemy begins by stating he has briefly reviewed the important principles and will now develop the details of astrology in the appropriate order. His point is that astrological assessment of any 'particular' individual must rest upon prior knowledge of the 'general' temperament of their ethnic type; and that the circumstances of individual lives are subsumed, to some extent, within the fate of their community.\n\nThe second chapter gives a broad generalisation of how genetic differences develop between the inhabitants of the various climes (a demarcation based on latitude). Communities that live close to the equator, for example, are described as having black skins, small statures, and thick woolly hair, as a protective response to the burning heat of that location. By contrast, communities that have settled in high northern regions are defined by their colder environment and its greater share of moisture. Their bodily forms are paler, taller, with finer hair, and in their characteristics they are described as \"somewhat cold in nature\". Both types are described as lacking civilisation because of the extremes of their environment, whereas communities that live in temperate regions are medium in colouring, moderate in stature and enjoy a more equable lifestyle. The several regions are similarly defined according to the mix that arises within this kind of analysis. Ptolemy explains that such considerations are only dealt with summarily, as a background consideration for what follows. He also makes clear that such traits are to be found \"generally present, but not in every individual\".\n\nIn chapter 3 Ptolemy unites his interests in astrology and geography, to outline the astrological associations of \"our inhabited world\". Maps based on Ptolemy’s \"Geographica\" show Ptolemy’s definition of the inhabited world as (roughly) extending from the equator to latitude 66°N, covering the land mass between the Atlantic Ocean and East China Sea. Ptolemy extends the logic given in ancient Babylonian texts where the four quarters of the known world are attributed to the four triplicity arrangements of the zodiac. The attribution is based on association between the planets that govern the triplicities and the directions and winds those planets are affiliated with. For example, the 'Aries triplicity' (which includes Aries, Leo and Sagittarius) is chiefly dominated by Jupiter and assisted by Mars. Jupiter rules the north wind and Mars the west wind; therefore this triplicity governs the north-west quarter of Ptolemy’s \"inhabited world\": the area known as Europe.\n\nAgain, these divisions are general, and specific rulership of each nation is modified by location and observed cultural distinctions. For example, in Europe, only those regions that lie to the north-west extremes are fully attributed to Jupiter and Mars, since those that lie towards the centre of the inhabited area incline towards the influence of opposing regions. In this way, the \"inhabited region\" experiences a drift of astrological correspondence rather than sharp divisions within its quarters, and independent nations are variously affiliated with the signs of each triplicity and the planets that rule them. Ptolemy names Britain and Spain as two nations appropriately placed in the north-west quarter to accept the rulership of Jupiter and Mars. Such nations are described as \"independent, liberty-loving, fond of arms, industrious\", based on characteristics attributed to those planets. Being predominantly governed by masculine planets they are also \"without passion for women and look down upon the pleasures of love\". Observed characteristics influence his categorisation of Britain as having a closer affinity with Aries and Mars (by which \"for the most part its inhabitants are fiercer, more headstrong and bestial\"), whilst Spain is reported to be more subject to Sagittarius and Jupiter, (from which is evidenced \"their independence, simplicity and love of cleanliness\").\n\nThough Ptolemy describes his analysis as a \"brief exposition\", the chapter builds into an extensive association between planets, zodiac signs and the national characteristics of 73 nations. It concludes with three additional assertions which act as core principles of mundane astrology:\n\nThe remainder of the book shows how this information is used in the prediction of mundane events. Focus is given to eclipses, as the \"first and most potent\" cause of change, supplemented by examination of the 'stations' of the superior planets: Saturn, Jupiter and Mars. Although eclipses are deemed relevant to any nation affiliated with the zodiac signs in which they occur, Ptolemy's scrutiny is reserved for regions where they are visible, which he argues will manifest the effects most noticeably. The period of obscuration determines the endurance of the effect, with each hour proportioning to years for a solar eclipse and months for a lunar eclipse. The location of the eclipse with relation to the horizon is then used to judge whether the effects are most prevalent at the beginning, middle or end of the period, with times of intensification identified by planetary contacts to the degree of the eclipse which occur within this period.\n\nChapter 7 begins the examination of what type of event will manifest. This is judged by the angle of the horizon which precedes the eclipse in the chart set for the location under scrutiny and the planet(s) that dominate this angle by rulership and powerful aspectual connections. Whether the predicted effect is beneficial or destructive depends on the condition of these planets, whilst the type of manifestation is judged by the zodiac signs, fixed stars and constellations involved. The resulting prediction is of relevance to nations, but Ptolemy points out that certain individuals are more resonant to the effects than others; namely those have the Sun or Moon in their horoscopes in the same degree as the eclipse, or the degree that directly opposes it.\n\nWithin his \"Almagest\" Ptolemy explains that he had access to eclipse records kept for 900 years since the beginning of the reign of king Nabonassar (747 BC). In chapter 9 of the \"Tetrabiblos\" he shows knowledge of the Babylonian lore that accompanied these records in detailing the omens based on visual phenomena. The colours of eclipses and \"the formations that occur near them, such as rods, halos, and the like\" are considered along with the astrological significance of comets, in whether they take the form of \"'beams', 'trumpets', 'jars', and the like\". Meaning is derived from their position relative to the Sun and assessment of \"the parts of the zodiac in which their heads appear and through the directions in which the shapes of their tails point\". It is noted that here Ptolemy uses principles that fall outside the neat theoretical logic he presents in book I, being explicable only in terms of the mythological and omen tradition inherited from his ancient sources. He also defends the subjective nature of the analysis involved, asserting that it would be impossible to mention the proper outcome of all this investigation, which calls for enterprise and ingenuity from the astrologer creating the judgement.\n\nThe remaining chapters of book II are dedicated to meteorological matters. Chapter 10 specifies that the new or full Moon preceding the Sun’s ingress into Aries can be used as a starting point for investigations concerning the weather patterns of the year. Lunations which precede the Sun’s ingress into any the other equinoctial and solstice signs (Cancer, Libra and Capricorn) can also be used for seasonal concerns, and within these \"monthly investigations\" bring more particular details based on lunations and the conjunctions of the planets. The recorded weather effects of the fixed stars in the zodiac constellations are systematically discussed, concluding with the relevance of generally observed sky phenomena such as shooting stars, cloud formations and rainbows. These final considerations are expected to add localised details to the original exploration of eclipse cycles. Ptolemy's theme throughout the book is that charts of this nature cannot be judged in isolation, but are to be understood within the pattern of cycles to which they belong, and where there are strong connections between the degree points involved; for:\n\nWith the astrologer expected to have knowledge and awareness of the mundane cycles that outline the background principles of the personal horoscope, Ptolemy closes this book with the promise that the next will supply \"with due order\" the procedure which allows predictions based on the horoscopes of individuals.\n\nBooks III and IV explore what Ptolemy terms \"the genethlialogical art\": the interpretation of a horoscope set for the moment of the birth of an individual. He explains that there are several cycles of life to consider but the starting point for all investigation is the time of conception or birth. The former \"the genesis of the seed\"” allows knowledge of events that precede the birth; the latter \"the genesis of the man\" is \"more perfect in potentiality\" because when the child leaves the womb and comes \"forth into the light under the appropriate conformation of the heavens\" the temperament, disposition and physical form of the body is set. The two moments are described as being linked by a \"very similar causative power\", so that the seed of the conception takes independent form at an astrologically suitable moment, whereby the impulse to give birth occurs under a \"configuration of similar type to that which governed the child's formation in detail in the first place\". Chapter 2 continues this theme in discussing the importance of calculating the precise degree of the ascendant at birth, the difficulty of recording local time precisely enough to establish this, and the methods available for rectification (\"i.e\"., ensuring the chart is correct).\n\nChapter 3 describes how the analysis of the chart is divided into predictions of:\n\nPtolemy explains the order by which each theme becomes relevant, and follows this in his arrangement of topics presented in the remaining chapters of books III and IV.\n\nFirst he deals with the prenatal matters, covering the astrological significators of the parents in chapter 4, and siblings in chapter 5. Then he deals with the matters \"directly concerned with the birth\", explaining how to judge such issues as whether the child will be male or female (ch.6); whether the birth will produce twins or multiple children (ch.7); and whether it will involve physical defects or monstrous forms; if so, whether these are accompanied by mental deficiency, notability or honour (ch.8). \n\nThe exploration of post-natal concerns begins in chapter 9 with a review of astrological factors that occur when children are not reared. This considers the indications of still births and babies that seem \"half-dead\", or those that have been left exposed (including whether there is possibility they may be taken up and live). Chapter 10 then details the techniques for establishing the length of life under normal circumstances. This is an important and lengthy passage of text, the techniques of which require precise astronomical detail and advanced knowledge of complex progressive techniques. Jim Tester has commented on how Ptolemy goes into an unusual level of detail in a responsibility that Bouché-Leclercq described as \"the chief task of astrology, the operation judged most difficult by practitioners, most dangerous and damnable by its enemies\". Such a prediction involves judicial skill as well as mathematical expertise since several 'destructive' periods may be identified but countered by other, protective astrological influences, resulting in periods of danger or illness that does not lead to death. This is followed, in chapter 11, by the astrological principles from which judgement is made of bodily appearance and temperament. The planetary significations follow the logic of their humoral associations, so that Jupiter (associated with warmth and moisture, an humoral combination which promotes growth) gives largeness in bodily form. Since these define, to some extent, predisposition towards bodily afflictions, there is a natural flow towards the content of chapter 12, which focuses on the astrological significators relating to injuries and diseases. The details of planetary associations with bodily organs and functions are given, such as Saturn ruling the spleen and Jupiter the lungs. Jim Tester has pointed out that several lists of this type exist \"more or less agreeing in detail\".\n\nThe third book concludes with a discussion in chapters 13 and 14 of what is described as a \"largely overlooked\" facet of Ptolemaic doctrine: the \"psychological\" one, which concerns the quality of the soul (or \"psyche\"). Historian Nicholas Campion has discussed the roots of the notion that celestial and psychological realms are connected, which can be traced to the 6th century BC, and in Ptolemy's case presents a mixture of Aristotelian and Stoic philosophy, resting on the Platonic view that \"the soul comes from the heavens\" which explains \"how human character comes to be determined by the heavens\".\n\nThe soul, for Ptolemy, includes the faculty for conscious reasoning, which is rational and attributed to the condition of Mercury, and the subconscious and unconscious elements of the mind (the \"sensory and irrational part\"), which is sensitive and attributed to the condition of the Moon. These two chapters make analysis of instinctual impulses and moral inclinations, being concerned with psychological motives and behavioural expression rather than the physical temperament described in chapter 11. Diseases of the soul are defined as \"affections which are utterly disproportionate and as it were pathological\" including insanity, inability to exercise moderation or restraint, instability of the emotions, depraved sexuality, morbid perversions, and violent afflictions of the intellectual and passive parts of the mind. The astrological explanations are mainly related to the exaggerated influence of destructive planets which are also in difficult configurations with Mercury and the Sun or Moon, or the planet associated with the psychological impulse (for example, Venus in matters of sexuality). Campion has pointed out that these planetary associations with psychological qualities are not original to Ptolemy, being present in the \"Corpus Hermeticum\" which was in circulation in Alexandria at the time Ptolemy compiled his text.\n\nWithin this book Ptolemy has surveyed all the topics that relate to inner qualities, genetic patterns, predispositions and the natural tendencies present from birth. His exploration of individual horoscopes continues into book IV, the only distinction of content being that subsequent topics relate to material matters and life experiences: what Ptolemy refers to as \"external accidentals\".\n\nBook IV is presented with a brief introduction to reaffirm the arrangement of content as previously described. It starts with the topics of riches and honour. Ptolemy says: \"as material fortune is associated with the properties of the body, so honour belongs to those of the soul\". Chapter 2, on material wealth, employs the \"so-called 'Lot of Fortune'\" although Ptolemy's instruction conflicts with that of many of his contemporaries in stating that for its calculation \"we measure from the horoscope the distance from the sun to the moon, in both diurnal and nocturnal nativities\". Ptolemy's reputation ensured this approach to calculation was adopted by many later Medieval and Renaissance astrologers, although it is now realised that most Hellenistic astrologers reversed the formula of calculation for nocturnal births. It is notable that in his discussion \"Of the fortune of Dignity\", in chapter three, Ptolemy makes no reference to the Lot of Spirit (or \"Daimon\"), which would normally be used as the spiritual counterpart to the material wealth and happiness associated with the Lot of Fortune. This is viewed as a demonstration of his general dislike (declared in bk. III.3) for \"lots and numbers of which no reasonable explanation can be given\".\n\nThe subsequent chapter, the title of which is translated by Robbins as 'Of the Quality of Action', concerns professional inclinations and the significators of career advance (or decline). This is followed by the treatment of marriage in chapter 5, which is primarily referred to the Moon in a man's chart, to describe his wife, and the Sun in a woman's chart to describe her husband. Here Ptolemy shows employment of the astrological technique known as synastry, in which the planetary positions of two separate horoscopes are compared with each other for indications of relationship harmony or enmity. \n\nThe next four chapters complete the survey of natal themes, dealing with the topics of children (ch.6); friends and enemies (ch.7); the dangers of foreign travel (ch.8) and the quality (or type) of death (ch.9 – as opposed to the time of death considered in III.10).\n\nThe final chapter of the work is described as \"a curious one\" for introducing a separate theme at the end of the book. This refers to the seven 'ages of man', which Ptolemy briefly mentioned in III.1 as a matter which varies the emphasis of astrological configurations according to the time in life they occur: \"we predict events that will come about at specific times and vary in degree, following the so called ages of life.\nHis argument is that, just as an astrologer must consider cultural differences \"lest he mistake the appropriate customs and manners by assigning, for example, marriage with a sister to one who is Italian by race, instead of to the Egyptian as he should\", it is necessary to consider the age in life that important astrological events occur. This is to ensure the prediction will \"harmonise those details which are contemplated in temporal terms with that which is suitable and possible for persons in the various age-classes\" and avoid out-of-context predictions such as imminent marriage for a young child, or \"to an extremely old man the begetting of children or anything else that fits younger men\". This leads into a discussion of the planetary themes of the seven ages of life which:\n\nThe information in the passage can be summarised as follows:\n\nThe book ends with a brief discussion of astronomical and symbolic cycles used in the prediction of timed events, which includes mention of (primary) directions, annual profections, ingresses, lunations and transits.\n\nThe translator of the Loeb 1940 English translation, F. E. Robbins, reports a \"puzzling problem\" regarding the final paragraph of the book. One group of manuscripts have either been left unconcluded or supplied with text that matches an \"Anonymous Paraphrase\" of the work (speculatively attributed to Proclus); the other presents text which is the same in general content, but longer, according with manuscripts that were transmitted through Arabic translations. Robbins considers it certain that the ending which concurs with the text of the \"Paraphrase\" is spurious. Robert Schmidt, the English translator of the later Project Hindsight edition agrees with his choice, stating that the text of the latter \"sounds more generally Ptolemaic\".\n\nRobbins explains that the lack of an ending usually occurs when ancient books are compiled in the form of a codex rather than a roll. Since the \"Paraphrase\" edition of the \"Tetrabiblos\" aimed to present the work's meaning without Ptolemy’s own complicated style of text construction, Robbins says that he \"cannot conceive how anyone (except perhaps Ptolemy) could have reversed the process and evolved the tortuous, crabbed Greek of the latter from the comparatively simple language of the former\". He therefore offers both versions of the ending whilst lending his support to that which is found in the Arabic version of the text. This has the book conclude with Ptolemy declaring \"since the topic of nativities has been summarily reviewed, it would be well to bring this procedure also to a fitting close\".\n\nNo original manuscripts of the text have survived; its contents are known from translations, fragments, paraphrased copies, commentaries and later Greek manuscripts. Astrological researcher Deborah Houlding, in an analysis of how specific points agree or vary between different editions, suggests that areas of conflicting details have been affected by three main streams of transmission: manuscripts that have passed through Arabic translation; those based on a paraphrased edition, and manuscripts that are dated four centuries later than the Arabic ones, but which have not undergone translation out of Greek.\n\nThe oldest extant manuscript is an Arabic translation compiled in the 9th century by Hunayn ibn Ishaq. This was first translated into Latin, in Barcelona, by Plato de Tivoli in 1138 and became influential as the first complete introduction of Ptolemy's astrological work in Medieval Europe. It survives in at least nine manuscripts and five Renaissance printings.\n\nOther Latin translations made from Arabic sources include an anonymous (unpublished) work compiled in 1206 and another of the 13th century by Egidio Tebaldi (Aegidius de Thebaldis). Typically, the Latin translations made from Arabic texts were circulated with a commentary compiled by Ali ibn Ridwan (Haly) in the 11th century.\n\nEgidio Tebaldi's translation was first published by Erhard Ratdolt in 1484 together with Haly's commentary and a \"pseudo-Ptolemaic\" list of aphorisms known as the \"Centiloquium\". This has been described as \"the creature of late-fifteenth-century Italian presses\".\n\nAn anonymous Greek paraphrase is speculatively attributed to the 5th-century philosopher Proclus. It is often referred to as the \"Proclus' Paraphrase\" although its authenticity is questioned, being described as \"very doubtful\" by Professor Stephan Heilen. The content of the \"Paraphrase\" is close to that of manuscripts of the \"Tetrabiblos\", but it uses simplified text with the aim of providing what Heilen calls \"a more easily understandable version of the difficult original work\".\n\nThere is no modern critical edition of this text. The oldest extant manuscript is dated to the 10th century and housed in the Vatican Library (Ms. \"Vaticanus gr.1453, S. X.\", ff.1–219). Some of the text of the \"Paraphrase\" was published with a Latin translation and Preface by Philipp Melanchthon in Basel, 1554, but this was not widely circulated. A full reproduction with an accompanying Latin translation was made around 1630 by the Vatican scholar Leo Allatius \"for his own private gratification\" and this was published by the Elzevir typsetters in Leiden, 1635, apparently without Allatius's knowledge or consent.\n\nAllatius' Latin translation was used as the source of all English translations of the \"Tetrabiblos\" prior to the Robbins' edition of 1940. These include translations made by John Whalley (1701); the Whalley \"corrected edition\" made by Ebenezer Sibly and his brother (1786); J.M. Ashmand (1822); James Wilson (1828); and other 19th-century privately circulated manuscripts such as that of John Worsdale.\n\nAlthough no copies of Ptolemy's original manuscript remain, there are other ancient works, such as Hephaistio's \"Apotelesmatics I\", which describe or reproduce some of its passages. These have been used to help verify disputed areas of content.\n\nThe oldest fairly complete Greek manuscript of the text (rather than the paraphrased edition made of it) is dated to the 13th century. Two or three others are dated to the 14th century but most are dated to the 15th and 16th centuries. In the 'Introduction' to his 1940's translation, Frank Eggleston Robbins reported the existence of at least 35 manuscripts containing all or a large part of the \"Tetrabiblos\" in European libraries.\n\nThe first printed edition was made in 1535 with an accompanying Latin translation by the German classical scholar Joachim Camerarius. This was reprinted in 1553 and is \"notable for offering the first Latin translation based upon a Greek rather than Arabic source\". Robbins noted the page numbers of the 1553 edition in the Greek text which faces his English translation, stating \"My collations have been made against Camerarius' second edition, because thus far this has been the standard text and it was most convenient\".\n\nAlso in 1940, a Greek critical edition was published by Teubner, in Germany, based on the unpublished work of Franz Boll which was completed by his student Emilie Boer. Robbins expressed regret at not being able to refer to this in the preparation of his English translation.\n\nIn 1994 the 'Boll-Boer' edition became the basis of a serialised English translation by Robert Schmidt, published by Project Hindsight. The 'Translator's Preface' was critical of Robbins' understanding of some of the \"conceptual issues involved\" and argued the need for a new English translation which recognised the \"probable superiority of the Teubner text edited by Boll and Boer in 1940\".\n\nThe most recent critical edition of the Greek text was made by the German scholar Professor Wolfgang Hübner, and published by Teubner in 1998. Based on 33 complete and 14 partial manuscripts, Hübner also incorporated the unpublished notes of Boer and the reasoning given in the Robbins and Boll-Boer editions. This is now considered the authoritative edition. A reviewer’s comment in The \"Classical Review\" declares of it \"Progress over previous editions is evident on virtually every page\".\n\nIn addition to the Arabic commentary on the \"Tetrabiblos\" made by Ali ibn Ridwan (Haly) in the 11th century,\nsignificant attention is given to an anonymous Greek \"Commentary\", which has older, obscure origins. It was written at an uncertain date, in either late antiquity or the Byzantine period. This is also attributed to Proclus, as the presumed author of the \"Paraphrase\", although Heilen has remarked that such an attribution \"looks like guesswork\". Houlding has also pointed out that differences in tabulated information presented within the \"Paraphrase\" and the \"Commentary\" \"is a telling argument that both cannot be the work of the same author\".\n\nThe Greek \"Commentary\" was first printed in 1559 with an accompanying Latin translation by Hieronymus Wolf. This claimed to be based on a heavily corrupted manuscript which required numerous conjectures by a scholarly friend of Wolf, who preferred to remain anonymous rather than face reproaches for \"dabbling in this sort of literature\". Wolf's edition was bound with an \"Introduction to the Tetrabiblos\", attributed (speculatively) to Porphyry, and the scholia of Demophilus.\n\nThe purpose of the \"Commentary\" was to offer demonstrated illustrations and fuller explanation of the astrological principles described by Ptolemy. Following Wolf's edition, large passages were incorporated into Latin astrological works which featured extensive collections of example horoscopes. Two notable examples are Jerome Cardan's \"Ptolemaei De Astrorvm Ivdiciis\" (Basel, 1578) and Francisco Junctinus's \"Speculum Astrologiae\" (Lugduni, 1583). Modern translators continue to make reference to the Hieronymous Wolf \"Commentary\" in their explanatory annotations.\n\nThe \"Centiloquium\" 'one hundred (sayings)' was the common Latin title of a collection of 100 important astrological aphorisms. It was also known in Latin as \"Liber Fructus\" (Arabic: \"Kitab al-Tamara\"; Hebrew: \"Sefer ha-Peri\") 'Book of the Fruit'. The latter reflected the belief that this offered a summation of Ptolemy's key astrological principles, and therefore presented \"The Fruit of his Four Books\". It began, as all Ptolemy's works did, with a dedication to \"Syrus\", which helped support the assumption of the work's Ptolemaic authenticity.\n\nEarly manuscripts were commonly accompanied by a commentary on their use authored by Ahmad ibn Yusuf al-Misri (835–912). This became translated into Latin at the same time as translations were being made of the Arabic editions of the \"Tetrabiblos\". The earliest translations were made by Johannes Hispanensis in 1136 and Plato of Tivoli in 1138.\n\nAli ibn Ridwan (Haly), who had produced the Arabic commentary on Ptolemy's work, noticed that the aphorisms highlighted principles of interrogational astrology, and wondered why Ptolemy had not included coverage of these themes in his \"Tetrabiblos\". Jerome Cardan was the first to declare the work a forgery based on such differences, referring in his commentary on the \"Tetrabiblos\" to an argument of Galen: \"In the old days, kings who were trying to establish great libraries bought the books of famous men at very high prices. By doing so they caused men to ascribe their own works to the ancients\".\n\nThe authorship of the text is now ascribed to \"Pseudo-Ptolemy\". Some scholars suggest that Ahmad ibn Yusuf was its true author. Others believe that the \"Centiloquium\", though not Ptolemy's, may preserve some collation of authentic materials from Hellenistic astrology. Ultimately, the historical assumption that the \"Centiloquium\" was part of Ptolemy's astrological legacy gave it widespread influence in the medieval period, by which it became established as an important text within the astrological tradition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Clarke. It is the third book in the four-book \"Rama\" series: \"Rendezvous with Rama\", \"Rama II\", \"The Garden of Rama\", and \"Rama Revealed\", and follows on from where \"Rama II\" left off.\n\nThe book picks up the story nine months after the end of \"Rama II\". The book follows the story of three astronauts from the expedition in \"Rama II\" who were trapped aboard the cylindrical alien spacecraft, Rama II, heading out towards deep space. Along the journey, five children were born. Simone Tiasso Wakefield, Catharine Colin Wakefield, Eleanor Joan Wakefield, Benjamin Ryan O'Toole and Patrick Erin O'Toole, were born by Nicole des Jardins from her relationships with Richard Wakefield and Michael O'Toole. These children later become major characters in \"Rama Revealed\". After a twelve-year journey, they arrive in the vicinity of the star Sirius, where all eight rendezvous with a Raman Node.\n\nAt the Node they are subjected to physiological tests for a year while Rama is refurbished, and they are eventually sent back to the solar system, this time to collect two thousand more representatives of humanity. An Earth agency, known as the ISA, receives the message from Rama requesting two thousand humans. Upon its reception, the message is kept secret and, under the guise of a new Martian colony, the ISA starts acquiring its payload. The ISA selects a handful of their own representatives; meanwhile, they selectively gather convicts and promise them freedom if they are chosen to be a colonist. The payload is subdivided into three ships: the Nina, Pinta, and Santa Maria (names based on Christopher Columbus's ships Niña, Pinta, and Santa María) that arrive sequentially at Rama. At this point the colonists believe everything is a hoax (despite the colossal size of Rama) created by the ISA. With that discontent as the tone upon their arrival, Rama III heads back to deep space with its new payload.\n\nSoon an aggressive group of humans, led by a mob boss, seizes control of the human colony and begins a war of annihilation and propaganda against one of the other races occupying the massive spacecraft. The original astronauts and their children find themselves powerless to prevent the genocide. However, the aggressive behavior of the human species does not go unnoticed: Another species, unknown to the humans, observe their behavior and start considering a possible counterattack.\n\nMeanwhile, Rama III determines that total escalation of the conflict is imminent and transmits an emergency signal to its ancient constructors. The book ends with a cliffhanger, on the eve of the execution of one of the original astronauts.\n\n\nGentry Lee also wrote two further novels set in the same Rama Universe.\n\n"}

According to the editor, it was translated in the late 18 century by the French naturalist Sonnini de Manoncourt from a \"Greek manuscript discovered in the archives at Constantinople and presented to him by the Sultan Abdoul Achmet\".

{"id": "56886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56886", "title": "Transposing instrument", "text": "Transposing instrument\n\nA transposing instrument is a musical instrument whose music is recorded in staff notation at a pitch different from the pitch that actually sounds (concert pitch). A written middle C on a transposing instrument produces a pitch other than middle C, and that pitch identifies the interval of transposition when describing the instrument. For example, a written C on a B clarinet sounds a concert B.\n\nRather than a property of the instrument, the transposition is a convention of musical notation. Instruments whose music is typically notated in this way are called transposing instruments. As transposing instruments is a notation convention, the issue of transposition is mainly an issue for genres of music which use sheet music, such as classical music and jazz (while jazz is an improvisation-based type of music, professional players are still expected to be able to read lead sheets and big band sheet music). For some instruments (e.g., the piccolo or the double bass), the sounding pitch is still a C, but in a different octave; these instruments are said to transpose \"at the octave\".\n\nMany instruments are members of a family of instruments that differ mainly in size (see examples below). The instruments in these families have differing ranges, with the members sounding lower as they get larger; but an identical pattern of fingerings on two instruments in the same family produces pitches a fixed interval apart. For example, the fingerings which produce the notes of a C major scale on a standard flute, a non-transposing instrument, produce a G major scale on an alto flute. As a result, these instruments' parts are notated so that the written notes are fingered the same way on each instrument, making it easier for a single instrumentalist to play several instruments in the same family.\n\nInstruments that transpose this way are often referred to as being in a certain \"key\", such as the \"A clarinet\" or \"clarinet in A\". The instrument's key tells which pitch will sound when the player plays a note written as \"C\". A player of a B clarinet who reads a written C will sound a B while the player of an A clarinet will read the same note and sound an A. The non-transposing member of the family is thus called a \"clarinet in C\".\n\nExamples of families of transposing instruments:\n\nExamples of families of non-transposing instruments:\n\nRecorders are either untransposed or in some cases transposed at the octave. In the early 20th century, however, instruments with basic scales other than C were sometimes written as transposing instruments.\n\nExamples of families with both transposing and non-transposing instruments:\nThe euphonium, with its close relative the baritone horn, may be played as either a treble clef instrument or a bass clef instrument because it is often played as a second instrument: trumpet or cornet players who double on the euphonium are used to playing in treble clef, while trombone or tuba players who double on the euphonium are used to playing in bass clef. In both cases, the instrument plays in the same range as the trombone, i.e., it produces the same pitches. However, in treble clef, the euphonium is a transposing instrument, i.e., its music and fingering are set up as if it is a B instrument (transposing), while in bass clef, its music and fingering assume that it is a C instrument (non-transposing). Musicians who play both bass- and treble-clef euphonium must learn to use different fingerings for the written notes: e.g., a B in treble clef requires that the first valve be depressed, whereas a B in bass clef is open. \n\nBefore valves were invented in the 19th century, horns and trumpets could play only the notes of the overtone series from a single fundamental pitch. (Exceptions included slide-bearing versions such as the sackbut and finger-hole horns like the cornett and serpent.) Beginning in the early 18th century, a system of crooks was devised in Germany, enabling this fundamental to be changed by inserting one of a set of crooks between the mouthpiece and the lead pipe of the instrument, increasing the total length of its sounding tube. As a result, all horn music was written as if for a fundamental pitch of C, but the crooks could make a single instrument a transposing instrument into almost any key. \n\nChanging these lead-pipe crooks was time-consuming, and even keeping them from falling out while playing was a matter of some concern to the player, so changing crooks could take place only during substantial rests. Medial crooks, inserted in the central portion of the instrument, were an improvement devised in the middle of the 18th century, and they could also be made to function as a slide for tuning, or to change the pitch of the fundamental by a semitone or tone. The introduction of valves made this process unnecessary, though many players and composers found the tone quality of valved instruments inferior (Richard Wagner sometimes wrote horn parts for both natural and valved horns together in the same piece). F transposition became standard in the early 19th century, with the horn sounding a perfect fifth below written pitch in treble clef. In bass clef, composers differed in whether they expected the instruments to transpose down a fifth or up a fourth.\n\nIn the music of Germany during the Baroque period, and notably in the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, instruments used for different purposes were often tuned to different pitch standards, called \"Chorton\" (\"choir pitch\") and \"Kammerton\" (\"chamber [music] pitch\"). When they played together in an ensemble, the parts of some instruments would then have to be transposed to compensate. In many of Bach's cantatas the organ part is notated a full step lower than the other instruments. See pitch inflation.\n\nA few early-music ensembles of the present day must do something similar if they comprise some instruments tuned to A415 and others to A440, approximately a semitone apart. Modern builders of continuo instruments sometimes include moveable keyboards which can play with either pitch standard. The harpsichord has a single string for each note, plucked by a plectrum and the difference in pitch between the Baroque A at 415 Hz and the \"modern\" A at 440 Hz is one half step. Moving the keyboard mechanism right or left causes the A key to play the next string, namely the A at 440 Hz or the A at 392 Hz respectively. Movement of the keyboard allows one to play higher or lower, though the topmost or bottommost key will not produce sound unless the builder has provided extra strings to accommodate the transposition feature.\n\nIf an instrument has a range too high or too low for composers to easily write its music on bass or treble clef, the music may be written either an octave higher or an octave lower than it sounds, in order to reduce the use of ledger lines. Instruments that \"transpose at the octave\" are not playing in a different key from concert pitch instruments, but sound an octave higher or lower than written. Music for the double bass is written an octave higher than it sounds. Thus, when cellos and basses are reading exactly the same part (a common practice by composers from the early Classical period), the basses' bassline is an octave below the cellos'.\n\nMost authorities include this type of notation under the umbrella \"transposing instruments\", although it's different from the way the term transposing is used in other musical contexts.\n\nMost woodwind instruments have one major scale whose execution involves lifting the fingers more or less sequentially from the bottom to top. This scale is usually the one notated as a C scale (from C to C, with no sharps or flats) for that instrument. The note written as C sounds as the note of the instrument's transposition: on an E alto saxophone, that note sounds as a concert E, while on an A clarinet, that note sounds as a concert A. Clarinets are one exception, in that they actually have two different scales in the first and second registers, nominally an F scale and a C scale, but treated by the performer as sounding \"at pitch\" for a C clarinet. The bassoon is another exception; it is not a transposing instrument, yet its \"home\" scale is F (like the low register of the C clarinet).\n\nBrass instruments, when played with no valves engaged (or, for trombones, with the slide all the way in), play a series of notes that form the overtone series based on some fundamental pitch, e.g., the B trumpet, when played with no valves engaged, can play the overtones based on B. Usually, that pitch is the note that indicates the transposition of that brass instrument. Trombones are an exception: they read at concert pitch, although tenor and bass trombones are pitched in B, alto trombone in E. Double horns are another exception, in that they combine two different sets of tubing into a single instrument, most characteristically in F and B. The horn part is nevertheless transposed uniformly in F (and indeed seldom if ever specifies whether a double or single horn is to be used), with the player deciding when to switch from one side of the instrument to the other. Single B horns also normally read from parts transposed in F.\n\nIn general, for these instruments there is some reason to consider a certain pitch the \"home\" note of an instrument, and that pitch is usually written as C for that instrument. The concert pitch of that note is what determines how we refer to the transposition of that instrument.\n\nIn conductors' scores and other full scores, music for transposing instruments is generally written in transposed form, just as in the players' parts. Some composers from the beginning of the 20th century onward have written orchestral scores entirely in concert pitch, e.g. the score of Sergei Prokofiev's Piano Concerto No. 1 in D.\n\nTransposing instruments' names almost always use flats instead of sharps (thus there are instruments in E or in B, but these are never today called instruments in D or in A). In practice the actual transposition in the score may (for the convenience of the player) depend on the key of the music. For example, in a section in C major an E alto saxophone part will appear in A major (three sharps). But in a section in concert B major it would be impractical to notate the sax part in G major part (a key with eight sharps, i.e. six sharps and one double-sharp). Instead, their part would appear in A major (four flats), just as if they were playing a D instrument.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1126068", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1126068", "title": "Willamette Meteorite", "text": "Willamette Meteorite\n\nThe Willamette Meteorite, officially named Willamette, is an iron-nickel meteorite found in the U.S. state of Oregon. It is the largest meteorite found in North America and the sixth largest in the world. There was no impact crater at the discovery site; researchers believe the meteorite landed in what is now Canada or Montana, and was transported as a glacial erratic to the Willamette Valley during the Missoula Floods at the end of the last Ice Age (~13,000 years ago). It was long held sacred by indigenous peoples of the Willamette Valley, including the federally recognized Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon (CTGRC). The indigenous peoples referred to this stone with the name \"Tomanowos\" (a Chinook word meaning \"spiritual power\").\n\nThe meteorite is on display at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, which acquired it in 1906. Having been seen by an estimated 40 million people over the years, and given its striking appearance, it is among the most famous meteorites known. In 2005, the CTGRC sued to have the meteorite returned to their control but they were unsuccessful.\n\nThe Willamette Meteorite weighs about . It is classified as a type III iron meteorite, being composed of over 91% iron and 7.62% nickel, with traces of cobalt and phosphorus. The approximate dimensions of the meteorite are tall by wide by deep. Most iron meteorites like Willamette have originated from the differentiated core of planetesimals or asteroids that collided with another object. Willamette has a recrystallized structure with only traces of a medium Widmanstätten pattern; it is the result of a significant impact-heating event on the parent body. The Willamette Meteorite contains higher concentrations of various metals that are quite rare in Earth's crust. For example, Iridium, one of the least abundant elements in Earth's crust, is found in the Willamette Meteorite at a concentration of 4.7 ppm, thousands of times more than its crustal abundance.\n\nThe lack of an impact crater at the discovery site was only explained after the 1920s, with the new understanding about the Missoula Floods, one of the largest floods documented, caused by the collapse of an ice barrier during the last deglaciation. The meteorite presumably landed on an ice cap in what is now Montana or western Canada, and was dragged by the glacier ice to the vicinity of an ice barrier that formed across the Clark Fork River. This barrier had ponded a huge amount of water at the Lake Missoula right at the time when the meteorite reached the area and the ice barrier became unstable and breached. The resulting flood involved up to 10 million cubic meters per second of water discharge, with large blocks of ice rafting down the Columbia River and the Willamette Valley at the end of the last Ice Age (~13,000 years ago). Some of these ice rafts included boulders (known as \"glacial erratics\" by geologists) like the Willamette meteorite, which eventually sank in the flood waters and settled where they were found by humans.\n\nThe deep crevasses of the meteorite resulted from both its high-speed atmospheric entry and its subsequent weathering. Exposed to the elements for thousands of years, rainwater interacted with the mineral troilite, resulting in a form of sulfuric acid which slowly dissolved portions of the meteorite. This resulted in the gradual development of the hollows that are visible today.\n\nThe Willamette Meteorite was originally found in the Willamette Valley of Oregon near the modern city of West Linn. Although already known and sacred to Native Americans, it came to prominence due to the actions of settler Ellis Hughes in 1902. At that time the land was owned by the Oregon Iron and Steel Company. Hughes recognized the meteorite's significance, and in an attempt to claim ownership, secretly moved it to his own land. This involved 90 days of hard work to cover the 3/4 mile (1200 m) distance. The move was discovered, and after a lawsuit, the Oregon Supreme Court held that Oregon Iron and Steel Company was the legal owner. Oregon Iron Co. v. Hughes, 47 Or 313, 82 P 572 (1905).\nIn 1905, the meteorite was purchased by William E. Dodge for $26,000 (around $680,000 in 2011). After being displayed at the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition, it was donated to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, where it has since been on display since 1906.\n\nThe meteorite was venerated by the Clackamas people inhabiting the area where it was found. The CTGRC, a confederation of Native American tribes, used the meteorite, which they call \"Tomanowos\", in ceremonies and demanded that it be returned and filed an action pursuant to the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) against the American Museum of Natural History in 1999. In response, the Museum filed a federal lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment against the CTGRC in 2000. An agreement with the Museum was reached later that year in which the meteorite would remain at the museum with tribal members being able to conduct a private ceremony around the meteorite once a year, and that ownership will be transferred to CTGRC should the museum cease to have the meteorite on display.\n\nIn response to a student's request in 2007, Representative John Lim introduced a resolution that would demand that the museum return the meteorite to Oregon. The tribes said they were not consulted, they did not support the resolution, and were content with the current arrangement with the museum.\n\nThe crown section of the meteorite that had been traded to the Macovich Collection for a Martian meteorite in 1997, was planned to be auctioned in October 2007, which led to claims by the CTGRC of insensitivity. Bidders dropped out when an editorial in the Portland \"Oregonian\" newspaper asserted the CTGRC would file a lawsuit against the new owner, but the CTGRC disavowed the editorial and said they had no such intent, and that they couldn't stop the sale. While the newspaper printed an apology, the specimen was withdrawn. A lawsuit was filed against the newspaper in Oregon Circuit Court and failed.\n\nA , piece of the meteorite, also with a Macovich Collection provenance, was purchased in a 2006 auction and is on display at the Evergreen Aviation & Space Museum in McMinnville, Oregon.\n\nThere is some confusion about the actual mass of the Willamette meteorite due difference between metric tons and short tons, often both called simply \"tons\". The result is that several sources report different weights, ranging from to . The official American Museum of Natural History Web site also reports both \"\"15.5 tons\" and \"14 tons\"\". However \"15,500 kg\" is likely 15.5 \"short tons\" converted as \"metric tons\" and \"12,700 kg\" is likely \"14 metric tons\" converted as \"short tons\". Moreover, in 1906 the American Museum of Natural History stated that the weight of the Willamette meteorite was \"at least 31,200 pounds, or about 15.6 tons\". After these considerations it is reasonable to guess that the real weight of the meteorite is about .\n\nA replica of the meteorite is in Eugene, Oregon, outside the University of Oregon Museum of Natural and Cultural History on the University of Oregon campus. Another replica stands near the Willamette Methodist Church in West Linn, Oregon. The only exact replica in existence is CNC-milled from a 3d model produced through photogrammetry by artist Garrick Imatani who worked in conjunction with the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde and the replica is currently installed in the Chachalu Museum at the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde in Grand Ronde, OR. The same artist has an interpretation of this meteorite on permanent display at the University of Oregon in Straub Hall. <ref> \n\n\n"}
{"id": "1947787", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1947787", "title": "Women in the military", "text": "Women in the military\n\nWomen have served in the military in various roles and in various jurisdictions throughout history.\n\nSince 1914, in western militaries, women have served in greater numbers and more diverse roles than before. In the 1970s, most Western armies began allowing women to serve in active duty in all military branches. In nine countries women are conscripted into military service. Only a few countries allow women to serve on an equal basis. They include Australia, Canada, Germany, Norway, Sweden and Denmark.\n\nDuring the First World War, the United States was in total warfare efforts.  Every person had to help in contributing to the war. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that everyone needed to fight.  The country needed to continue to fund their troops and support the war financially while soldiers were fighting. The United States relied on organizations to support the war efforts.  Women joined organizations such as the Committee on Public Information in order to educate people about the war. This committee additionally promoted nationality. In addition to working for committees having to do with education, women worked in all sorts of positions.  Many women became YWCA members and bravely went overseas to help soldiers. This was the first time in history that women of all classes were working together to help the war efforts. Upper class women founded many voluntary war organizations while middle and lower class women worked in these organizations by working as nurses or by filling in the jobs of men.\n\nAlthough all women were working to help their country, many women of color faced prejudice during this time.  Due to the war effort, many African American families moved from rural farms to urban cities. African American women were given the most hard working jobs with the lowest pay.  Many organizations were formed, such as the Colored YWCA, to support African American women. These organizations helped these women find safe homes and stable jobs. They also hired many social workers to make it certain that employers treated women of color equally.  Towards the end of World War I, black women were legally allowed to travel overseas to help the Red Cross. Many women from the Association of Colored Graduate Nurses were the first African Americans to help the Red Cross. Although this is a step in the right direction, the United States still has a long way to reduce prejudice and provide equal rights for African American women and people of color as a whole.  \n\nThe only nation to deploy female combat troops in substantial numbers was Russia. From the onset, female recruits either joined the military in disguise or were tacitly accepted by their units. The most prominent were a contingent of front-line light cavalry in a Cossack regiment commanded by a female colonel, Alexandra Kudasheva. Others included Maria Bochkareva, who was decorated three times and promoted to senior NCO rank, while \"The New York Times\" reported that a group of twelve schoolgirls from Moscow had enlisted together disguised as young men. In 1917, the Provisional Government raised a number of \"Women's Battalions\", with Bochkareva given an officer's commission in command. They fought well, but failed to provide the propaganda value expected of them and were disbanded before the end of the year. In the later Russian Civil War, they fought both for the Bolsheviks (infantry) and the White Guard.\n\nIn Serbia, a few individual women played key military roles. Scottish doctor Elsie Ingles coordinated a retreat of approximately 8,000 Serbian troops through Romania and revolutionary Russia, up to Scandinavia and finally onto transport ships back to England . Another woman, Milunka Savic, enlisted in the Serbian army in place of her brother. She fought throughout the war, becoming possibly the most decorated woman in military history.\n\nIn 1917 Loretta Walsh became the first woman to enlist as a woman. A 1948 law made women a permanent part of the military services. In 1976, the first group of women were admitted into a U.S. military academy. Approximately 16% of the 2013 West Point class consisted of women.In the 1918 Finnish Civil War, more than 2,000 women fought in the Women's Red Guards.\n\nIn the Spanish Civil War, thousands of women fought in mixed-gender combat and rearguard units, or as part of militias.\n\nIn 1990 and 1991, some 40,000 American military women were deployed during the Gulf War operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm; however, no women served in combat. A policy enacted in 1994 prohibited women from assignment to ground combat units below the brigade level.\n\nAll the major participating nations in World War II enlisted women. The majority served as nursing and clerical or support roles. Over 500,000 women had combat roles in anti-aircraft units in Britain and Germany, as well as front-line units in the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 1938, the British took the lead in establishing uniformed services for women (small units of nurses had long been in service). In late 1941, Britain began conscripting women, sending most into factories and some into the military, especially the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) attached to the army. The ATS began as a women's auxiliary in 1938. In 1941, the ATS was granted military status, although women received only two thirds of male pay. Women had a well-publicized role in handling anti-aircraft guns against German planes and V-1 missiles. The daughter of Prime Minister Winston Churchill was there, and he gushed that any general who saved him 40,000 fighting men had gained the equivalent of a victory. By August 1941, women were operating fire-control instruments; although they were never allowed to pull the trigger, since killing the enemy was considered to be too masculine. By 1943, 56,000 women were in Anti-Aircraft Command, mostly in units close to London where they faced a risk of death, but not of capture. The first death of a woman in Anti-Aircraft Command occurred in April 1942.\n\nThe Third Reich had similar roles for women. The SS-Helferinnen were regarded as part of the SS if they had undergone training at a Reichsschule SS. All other female workers were contracted to the SS and chosen largely from concentration camps. Women served in auxiliary units in the navy (Kriegshelferinnen), air force (Luftnachrichtenhelferinnen) and army (Nachrichtenhelferin).\n\nIn 1944-45 roughly 500,000 women were volunteer uniformed auxiliaries in the German armed forces (Bundeswehr). About the same number served in civil aerial defense, 400,000 volunteered as nurses and many more replaced drafted men in the wartime economy. In the Luftwaffe they served in combat roles helping to operate anti-aircraft systems to shoot down Allied bombers. By 1945, German women held 85% of the billets as clerics, accountants, interpreters, laboratory workers and administrative workers, together with half of the clerical and junior administrative posts in high-level field headquarters.\n\nThe German nursing service consisted of four main organizations, one for Catholics, one for Protestants, the secular DRK (Red Cross) and the \"Brown Nurses,\" for committed Nazi women. Military nursing was primarily handled by the DRK, which came under partial Nazi control. Frontline medical services were provided by male medics and doctors. Red Cross nurses served widely within the military medical services, staffing the hospitals close to the front lines and at risk of attack. Two dozen were awarded the Iron Cross for heroism under fire. Brown Nurses were forced to look away while their incapacitated patients were murdered by war criminals.\n\nHundreds of women auxiliaries (Aufseherin) served in the SS in the camps, the majority of which were at Ravensbrück. \n\nIn Germany women worked and were told by Hitler to produce more pure Aryan children to fight in future wars.\n\nJapanese American Women\n\nDuring the second world war, many Japanese American women lost their jobs or pay because they were sent to relocation camps.  Japanese immigrants and Japanese Americans were faced with discrimination. Many Americans called it the “yellow peril” and called Japanese people “japs”.  In 1913, California passed the Alien Land Law which prohibited “aliens ineligible for citizenship” from owning land to grow crops on. Despite the discrimination, many Japanese American women volunteered to serve in the Women’s Auxiliary Army Corps.  Sexism along with racism was something that these women faced when they joined WAAC. Even while dealing with discrimination, Japanese American women were able to greatly help the United States. Many women were hired as interpreters, translators, and interrogators in the Military Intelligence Service.  In 1948, the Women’s Army Corps was permanently established and remained until 1978 when women were allowed into the army.\n\nThe Yugoslav National Liberation Movement had 6,000,000 civilian supporters; its two million women formed the Antifascist Front of Women (AFŽ), in which the revolutionary coexisted with the traditional. The AFŽ managed schools, hospitals and local governments. About 100,000 women served with 600,000 men in Tito's Yugoslav National Liberation Army. It stressed its dedication to women's rights and gender equality and used the imagery of folklore heroines to attract and legitimize the fighters. After the war, although women were relegated to traditional gender roles, Yugoslavia's historians emphasized women's roles in the resistance. After Yugoslavia broke up in the 1990s, women's contributions to the resistance were forgotten.\n\nThough relatively little official data exists about female Vietnam War veterans, the Vietnam Women’s Memorial Foundation estimates that approximately 11,000 military women were stationed in Vietnam during the conflict. Nearly all of them were volunteers, and 90 percent served as military nurses, though women also worked as physicians, air traffic controllers, intelligence officers, clerks and other positions in the U.S. Women’s Army Corps, U.S. Navy, Air Force and Marines and the Army Medical Specialist Corps. In addition to women in the armed forces, an unknown number of civilian women served in Vietnam on behalf of the Red Cross, United Service Organizations (USO), Catholic Relief Services and other humanitarian organizations, or as foreign correspondents for various news organizations.\n\nIn addition to the U.S. military women who served in Vietnam, an unknown number of female civilians willingly gave their services on Vietnamese soil during the conflict. Many of them worked on behalf of the American Red Cross, Army Special Services, United Service Organizations (USO), Peace Corps, and various religious groups such as Catholic Relief Services.\n\nOther American women traveled to Vietnam as foreign correspondents for news organizations, including Georgette “Dickey” Chappelle, a writer for the National Observer who was killed by a mine while on patrol with U.S. Marines outside Chu Lai in November 1965. According to the Vietnam Women’s Memorial Foundation, 59 female civilians died during the conflict. \n\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo began training an initial 150 women as para-commandos for the Armée Nationale Congolaise in 1967. Many more were trained subsequently, over a period of years. The women received parachute and weapons training, although it is unclear to what extent they were actually integrated into the combat units of the Congo. \n\nIn 1999, the BBC reported that about a quarter of the Eritrean soldiers in the Eritrean–Ethiopian War were women.\n\nIsrael is the only country with conscription for women. Mandatory conscription for single and married women without children began in 1948.\n\nInitially, women conscripts served in the Women's Army Corps, serving as clerks, drivers, welfare workers, nurses, radio operators, flight controllers, ordnance personnel and instructors. Roles for women beyond technical and secretarial support began opening up in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nIn 2000, the Equality amendment to the Military Service law granted equal opportunities in the military to women found physically and personally suitable for a job. Women started to enter combat support and light combat roles in a few areas, including the Artillery Corps, infantry units and armored divisions. A few platoons named Carakal were formed for men and women to serve together in light infantry. Many women joined the Border Police.\n\nDespite these changes, fewer than 4 percent of women service members are in combat positions such as infantry, crew of tanks or other armored vehicles, artillery guns service, fighter pilots, etc. Rather, they are concentrated in \"combat-support\".\n\nThe proportion of female military personnel varies internationally; for example, it is approximately 3% in India, 10% in the UK, 15% in France, 13% in Sweden, 16% in the US, 15.3% in Canada, and 27% in South Africa. While a marginal percentage of women are reported in military service globally, estimates following the increasing trend of military women capped predictions at about 10% for 1980. As expressed by the current percentages, these numbers have not risen much passed that, with the exception of South Africa. Many state armed forces that recruit women continue to bar them from ground close combat roles (roles that would require them to kill at close quarters). This practice preserves male domination within militaries. In limiting female entry, militaries have maintained their characteristic brutal masculinity. Compared with male personnel and female civilians, female personnel face substantially higher risks of sexual harassment and sexual violence, according to British, Canadian and US research. Not only have women been left unprotected, but the major cause of PTSD experienced by women is identified as military sexual trauma (MST). The male experience of PTSD derives from that of combat trauma.\n\nSome nations allow female soldiers to serve in certain combat arms positions. Others exclude them for various reasons including physical demands and privacy policies. Among the NATO nations, and as of the mid-1970s, women were able to attain military status in the following countries: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Non-conscription countries, notably the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada are where the highest levels of female military presences were achieved. Canada is marked as particularly progressive in its early implementation of gender equality practices. A rise in the call for equal opportunity coupled with the decline of able-bodied men willing to enter military service coaxed countries to reform policies toward female inclusion. . With the opening of submarine service in 2000, women now had free reign to enlist in any kind of military service. Despite their gender-neutral approach, a lack of female retention programs have kept female military participation to about 15.3%.\n\nThe United States military opens all positions to women. Units such as Special Forces require members to meet extraordinary requirements, and no females have met them in some units.\n\nWomen have been involved in the U.S. military since 1775, originally in the civilian fields of nursing, laundering, mending clothing and cooking. \n\nDeborah Sampson was one of the first women to enlist while disguised as a man. She was unhappy with her limited role in the American Revolution. She served in a light infantry unit, fighting in many battles. Injuries put her in a hospital where her secret was discovered. Her commanding officer, General John Paterson, honorably discharged her and thanked her for her service. \n\nSeveral hundred women enlisted and fought in the US Civil War, generally disguised as men. In some cases their identity was discovered, typically on the battlefield or in hospitals after becoming wounded. \n\nIn 1917 Loretta Walsh became the first woman to enlist as a woman. A 1948 law made women a permanent part of the military services. In 1976, the first group of women were admitted into a U.S. military academy. Approximately 16% of the 2013 West Point class consisted of women.\n\nIn 1990 and 1991, some 40,000 American military women were deployed during the Gulf War operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm; however, no women served in combat. A policy enacted in 1994 prohibited women from assignment to ground combat units below the brigade level.\n\nUntil 1993, 67 percent of the positions in the Army were open to women. \n\nIn 2013, 15.6 percent of the Army's 1.1 million soldiers, including National Guard And Reserve, were female, serving in 95 percent of occupations. As of 2017 78 percent of the positions in the Army are open to women. In the U.S. Air Force, 99% of career fields are open to women, with the only exceptions Special Tactics Officer, Combat Control, Special Operations Weather Technician, Combat Rescue Officer, Pararescue and Tactical Air Control Party.\n\nIn January 2013, the US ended the policy of \"no women in units that are tasked with direct combat\". \n\nIn 2013 female U.S Army soldiers enrolled in a training course designed by Combined Joint Task Force Paladin, specifically designed for Female Engagement Team members. The course was intended to train female soldiers for tasks such as unexploded ordnance awareness, biometrics, forensics, evidence collection, tactical questioning, vehicle and personnel searches and homemade explosive devices. \n\nBy May 2015, none of the nineteen women vying to become the first female Army Rangers had passed Ranger School. Eleven of the nineteen dropped out in the first four days. Of the remaining eight who failed in the next step, three were given the option to. Two graduated in August 2015. A third graduated in October 2015.\n\nIn April 2015 after two-and-a-half year period in which the Marine Corps' Infantry Officer Course became gender-integrated for research ended without a single female graduate. The final two participants failed the initial Combat Endurance Test.\n\nIn 2016 all combat jobs opened to women. \n\nWomen have been injured, killed, and awarded high honors. Two women received the Silver Star: Sgt. Leigh Ann Hester in 2005 and Army Specialist Monica Lin Brown in 2007 for their actions in combat. Over 10,000 combat action badges were awarded to women who served in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nA 2015 Marine Corps study found that women in a unit created to assess female combat performance were significantly injured twice as often as men, less accurate with infantry weapons and not as good at removing wounded troops from the battlefield.\n\nThe study assessed a nine-month experiment at Camp Lejeune, N.C., and Twentynine Palms, Calif. About 400 Marines, including 100 women, volunteered to participate.\n\nMale squads, teams and crews demonstrated better performance on 93 of 134 tasks evaluated (69 percent) than units with women in them. Male units were faster while completing tactical movements in combat situations, especially in units with large \"crew-served\" weapons such as heavy machine guns and mortars. Male infantry squads had better accuracy than squads with women in them, with \"a notable difference between genders for every individual weapons system\" used by infantry rifleman units. The M4 carbine, M27 infantry automatic rifle and M203 single-shot grenade launcher were assessed.\n\nMale Marines who had not received infantry training were more accurate than women who had. In removing wounded troops from the battlefield, \"notable differences in execution times were found between all-male and gender-integrated groups\".\n\nUnit cohesion was lower in mixed gender units. Many female soldiers reported that the way that they are viewed by male soldiers is often detrimental to their participation. For instance, female soldiers are often labelled as \"either standoffish or a slut\". In order to avoid such labels, female soldiers have to spend time with fellow soldiers strategically, without spending too much time with any one of them. This approach often has an isolating effect. In several instances, women were considered less skilled than male soldiers, so were not given opportunities to complete tasks for which they were qualified. \n\nAccording to Lt. Col. Dave Grossman, author of \"On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society\", Israeli soldiers reacted with uncontrollable protectiveness and aggression after seeing a woman wounded. Further, Islamic militants rarely, if ever, surrender to female soldiers, lessening the IDF's ability to take prisoners. Iraqi and Afghan civilians are often not intimidated by female soldiers. However, in socially conservative environments, female combat soldiers can search female civilians, while children and women are more likely to talk to female soldiers than to male soldiers.\n\nOne 2009 report concluded that military women were three times more likely to be raped than civilians; and that women soldiers in Iraq were more likely to be attacked by another soldier than by an insurgent. In 1988, the first military-wide sexual harassment survey found that 64% of military women had been subjected to some form of sexual harassment. The most affected were Native-Americans, followed by Hispanics and African-Americans.\n\nSexual assault is more likely to occur in the military than in the civilian population. One in four active-duty female military personnel will be sexually assaulted. The military has a Code Of Justice which defines sexual assault: rape, aggravated assault, abusive sexual assault, nonconsensual sodomy (forced oral or anal sex), or attempts to commit these acts. \n\nAll of these acts are punishable by military law which begins by the victim going forward to their commander. It is then their job to make an inquiry on the perpetrator, however they also have the right to dismiss the claims. They can also the right to take non-judicial punishment or take it to high authority. If the perpetrator's punishment can go from dismissal, to dishonorable discharge to confinement in military prison. If found with the crime of rape the perpetrator can carry a lifetime of imprisonment to in extreme cases even execution. When women went to report their sexual assault 83% of the victims stated that their experiences with military legal personnel made them reluctant to seek further help. \n\nMany victims in the military describe the response to and aftermath of sexual assault as more painful than the assault itself because of the unspoken \"code of silence.\" The code of silence implicates that women should keep quiet about their assault and not come forward to take action. Women expect that little will be done, so most cases go unreported. When they are reported and taken to court only ten percent of cases have the perpetrator charged for their crimes, which is a reason women won't come forward as they know little will come from it.\n\nFemale soldiers have developed several techniques for avoiding sexual assault \"including: (1) relying on support networks [buddy systems], (2) capitalizing on their status (associated with rank, age, time spent in military, or prior deployment experience); and, (3) masking femininity through clothing to minimize violence exposure and to keep themselves and others safe during military service\". Such strategies leave the burden of addressing the problem on potential victims. Conversely, in many units, soldiers pair off as \"buddies\" who watch out for each other. In mostly male units, females buddy with males who then often becomes excessively protective, reducing the female's agency.\n\nA lawsuit seeks redress for military plaintiffs who claim to have been subjected to sexual assault. \"The Invisible War\" addresses this lawsuit and topic. \n\nSexual assault leads to many health problems for women in the military such as anxiety disorders, such as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, substance abuse, binge eating, dissociation and memory impairment, suicidal and parasuicidal behavior, sexual dysfunction and dissatisfaction, poor self-esteem, and personality disorders, such as borderline personality disorder. It also takes a toll on their physical health and have reported having menstrual complications, headaches, back pain, gastrointestinal pain. \n\nAll of these factors make it hard for women to stay in the military, in women it is the leading cause for early leave of the armed forces. Once leaving the military though women have a hard time reintegrating back into society and can end up homeless. It is so debilitating for women in the military because most of their perpetrates are people they work and live with, from peers to a supervisor and higher above. This close relationship creates a new type of trauma as the victim is forced to see them every day and creates an overall lack of trust in people. \n\nThey more often fail to complete college, and generally earn incomes less than $25,000. Their work can involve frequent interactions with their attacker, and damages trust in the institution. Perpetrators are typically in a higher position have the job to protect the woman, increasing trauma.\n\nUpdated military training focuses on bystander interventions and the role of consent in sexual activity, emphasizing the responsibility of male soldiers. Some female soldiers assume the classically male role of \"protector\". This works to change women's \"responsibility for preventing rape\" and requires that male soldiers acknowledge their responsibility to engage with female soldiers in all activities.\n\nIn 1985 the Royal Norwegian Navy became the first navy in the world to permit female personnel to serve in submarines. The first female submarine commander was Captain Solveig Krey aboard the first Kobben class submarine on 11 September, 1995. The Danish Navy allowed women on submarines in 1988, the Swedish Navy in 1989, followed by the Royal Australian Navy in 1998, Canada in 2000 and Spain. \n\nOn April 29, 2010, the United States Navy authorized women to serve aboard submarines. Previously, objections such as the need for separate accommodation and facilities (estimates that modifying submarines to accommodate women would cost $300,000 per bunk versus $4,000 per bunk on aircraft carriers) had prevented the change. The Navy stated that larger SSGN and SSBN submarines had more available space and could accommodate female officers with little/no modification. Qualified female candidates with the desire to serve were available. (Women then represented 15 percent of active duty sailors and were earning about half of all science and engineering bachelor's degrees.)\n\nIn May 2014, it was announced that three women had become the UK Royal Navy's first female submariners.\n\nOn November 15, 2017, the first Argentinian female submarine officer , disappeared in the Atlantic Ocean after the Argentinean Navy lost contact with \"ARA San Juan\" submarine after a reported failure in the electric system. As one of the 44 crew members lost at sea, Krawczyk was honoured by the country's Jewish community as \"La Reina De Los Mares\" on International Women's Day in 2018. \n\nOn July 4, 2017, after two years of training, four female officers boarded a French SSBN for France's first seventy-day mixed gender patrol. The next generation of French submarines are designed to welcome women.\n\nWomen are expected to join submarine crews in the Royal Netherlands Navy in 2019, with the addition of shower doors and changing room curtains.\n\nA 2008 study found that female cadets saw military training as an \"opportunity to be strong, assertive and skillful\" and saw such training \"as an escape from some of the negative aspects of traditional femininity\". The female cadets also believed that the ROTC program was \"gender-blind\" and \"gender-neutral\". The study claims that female cadets \"were hyper-vigilant about their status as women performing tasks traditionally seen as men's work and often felt that they had to constantly prove they were capable.\"\n\nThe study quoted one female cadet: \"in the Navy the joke is that a woman in the Navy is either a bitch, a slut or a lesbian, and \"none of them are good categories to fall into\", and if you are stern with your people then you are a bitch, but if you're a guy and stern people are like, wow, I respect him for being a good leader.\"\n\n84 percent of cadets said they did not want a military career as it would interfere with marriage and raising children.\n\nA 2009 study examined the attitudes of West Point cadets, Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) cadets, and non-military-affiliated students from civilian colleges toward a variety of military roles. Cadets were less approving of assigning women to certain military jobs than others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
