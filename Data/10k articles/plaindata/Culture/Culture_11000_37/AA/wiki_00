{"id": "29214621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29214621", "title": "Ashta Nayika", "text": "Ashta Nayika\n\nThe Ashta-Nayika is a collective name for eight types of \"nayika\"s or heroines as classified by Bharata in his Sanskrit treatise on performing arts - \"Natya Shastra\". The eight nayikas represent eight different states (\"avastha\") in relationship to her hero or \"nayaka\". As archetypal states of the romantic heroine, it has been used as theme in Indian painting, literature, sculpture as well as Indian classical dance and music.\n\nAs per Ashta Nayika, there are eight nayikas.\n\nThe Ashta-Nayika classification (\"nayika-bheda\") first appears in \"Natya Shastra\" (24.210-11), a key Sanskrit treatise on Indian performing arts, authored by Bharata (dated between 2nd century BC and 2nd century AD). The classification is detailed in later works like the \"Dasarupaka\" (10th century), \"Sahityadarpana\" (14th century) and various other treatises on poetics as well as erotic \"Kamashastra\" texts like Kuttanimata (8th-9th century) based on courtesans, \"Panchasayaka\", \"Anangaranga\" and \"Smaradipika\". Keshavadasa's \"Rasikapriya\" (16th century) in Hindi, also elaborates on the Ashta-nayika.\n\nThe Ashta-Nayika have been illustrated in Indian painting, literature, sculpture as well as Indian classical dance. Notable medieval paintings that depict the Ashta nayika are the Ragamala paintings, as those from the Bundi school of painting.\n\nA famous example in Indian literature is Jayadeva's \"Gita Govinda\" (12th century) as well as in the Vaishnava poet Banamali's compositions, Radha dons the roles of the various nayikas while with her nayaka is the god Krishna.\n\nThe Ashta-Nayika is a central theme in \"Pahari embroidery\" used to decorate the \"Chamba Rumal\", especially produced in Chamba, Himachal Pradesh. The Ashta Nayika are usually portrayed in eight panels on the Rumal.\n\nIn Indian (Hindustani) classical music, the eternal love between Radha and Krishna is represented through the consciousness of Radha as the leitmotif that dominates the lyrics. Especially the semi-classical genre of Thumri imbibes the myriad moods of Radha as Ashta Nayika consumed by passionate love for Krishna.\n\nThe \"Natya Shastra\" describes the nayikas in the following order: Vasakasajja, Virahotkanthita, Svadhinabhartruka, Kalahantarita, Khandita, Vipralabdha, Proshitabhartruka and Abhisarika. The nayikas are further classified in two varieties of the \"shringara rasa\", the \"rasa\" related to love: Sambhoga (love in meeting) and Vipralambha (love in separation). Vasakasajja, Svadhinabhartruka and Abhisarika are associated with Sambhoga; the others with Vipralambha.\n\nIn the \"Shringara Prakasha\", Bhoja relates the various nayakas and nayikas with musical \"raga\"s and \"ragini\"s (a female raga). Somanatha's \"Ragavibodha\" (1609) and Damodara's \"Sangitadarpana\" (c. 1625) continue this trend.\n\nVasakasajja (\"one dressed up for union\") or Vasakasajjika is waiting for her lover returning from a long journey. She is depicted in her bed-chamber filled with lotus leaves and garlands. She is dressing herself for the union with her lover and \"eager with expectation of love's pleasure\". Her beauty is compared by Kesavadasa to Rati - the Hindu love goddess, waiting for her husband, the love god Kamadeva. A Vasakasajja sculpture is found in the Lakshmana Temple in Khajuraho and the National Museum, Delhi.\n\nThe \"Ragavibodha\" associates the raginis Bhupali and Todi with Vasakasajja.\n\nVirahotkanthita (\"One distressed by separation\") or Utka (as described by Keshavadasa) is the distressed heroine pining for her lover, who, due to his preoccupation, fails to return home. She is depicted waiting for him, sitting or standing on a bed or out in the pavilion.\n\nThe \"Ragavibodha\" identifies the raginis Mukhari, Pauravi and Turushkatodi with the Virahotkanthita, while the \"Sangitadarpana\" names Patamanjari in this category.\nSvadhinabhartruka (\"one having her husband in subjection\") or Svadhinapatika(as named by Keshavadasa) is the woman who is loved by her husband and controls him. He is subjugated by her intense love and pleasing qualities.He is devoted and faithful to her\n\nMany raginis like Malashri, Travanika, Ramakriti, Jaitashri and Purvi are associated with Svadhinabhartruka.\n\nKalahantarita (\"one separated by quarrel\") or Abhisandhita (as named by Keshavadasa) is a heroine separated from her lover due to a quarrel or jealousy or her own arrogance. Her lover is usually depicted leaving her apartment disheartened, while she too becomes heartsick and repentant without him. In other portrayals, she is depicted refusing the advances of her lover or refusing a wine cup from him. In Gita Govinda, Radha is also portrayed as Kalahantarita in an instance.\nKhandita (\"one enraged with her lover\") is an enraged heroine, whose lover had promised her to spend the night with her, but instead comes to her house the next morning after spending the night with another woman. She is depicted offended, rebuking her lover for his infidelity.\n\nIn the \"Sangitadarpana\", the ragini Varati represents the Khandita Nayika.\n\nVipralabdha (\"one deceived by her lover\"), , is a deceived heroine, who waited for her lover the whole night. She is depicted throwing away her jewellery as her lover did not keep his promise. This happens when a lover meets a Khandita and promises a tryst and breaks his promise.\n\nThe \"Sangitadarpana\" associates Vipralabdha with the ragini Bhupali. However, the \"Ragavibodha\" presents the raginis Varati and Velavati as Vipralabdhas.\n\nProshitabhartruka (\"one with a sojourning husband\") or Proshitapatika (as named by Keshavadasa) is the woman whose husband has gone away from her for some business and does not return on the appointed day. She is depicted seated mourning, surrounded by her maids, but refusing to be consoled.\n\nThe \"Ragavibodha\" describes the raginis Dhanashri and Kamodi as Proshitabhartrukas.\n\nAbhisarika (\"one who moves\") is a heroine, who sets aside her modesty and moves out of her home to secretly meet her lover. She is depicted at the door of her house and on her way to the tryst, defying all kinds of difficulties like the storm, snakes and dangers of the forest. In art, Abhisarika is portrayed often in hurry towards her destination.\n\nThe raginis Bahuli and Saurashtri are described having the traits of the daring Abhisarika.\n"}

{"id": "577911", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=577911", "title": "Canadian Centennial", "text": "Canadian Centennial\n\nThe Canadian Centennial was a yearlong celebration held in 1967 when Canada celebrated the 100th anniversary of the Canadian Confederation. Celebrations occurred throughout the year but culminated on Dominion Day, July 1, 1967. Coins were different from other years' issues, with animals on each — the cent, for instance, had a dove on its reverse. Communities and organizations across Canada were encouraged to engage in Centennial projects to celebrate the anniversary. The projects ranged from special one-time events to local improvement projects, such as the construction of municipal arenas and parks. The Centennial Flame was also added to Parliament Hill. Children born in 1967 were declared Centennial babies.\n\nUnder the Centennial Commission, convened in January 1963, various projects were commissioned to commemorate the Centennial year. The CBC commissioned Gordon Lightfoot to write the song the \"Canadian Railroad Trilogy\" for broadcast on January 1, 1967. The Canadian Government commissioned typographer Carl Dair to create a new and distinctively Canadian typeface. The first proof of Cartier was published as \"the first Canadian type for text composition\" to mark the centenary of Canadian Confederation.\n\nThe Canadian Armed Forces contributed to Centennial celebrations by producing a military tattoo unlike any other in Canadian history. It was formed in Picton, Ontario in February 1967 by members from the three branches of the military providing service personnel at the Picton base for training purposes. The \"show\" was produced by Colonel Ian Fraser of the Black Watch and would eventually included 1700 military men and women in a show that would travel across Canada from March to November performing over 150 performances. Some said that Tattoo 1967 was the major event that year and there were calls to have the Tattoo travel through the U.S., Europe and even Russia but the Prime Minister at the time scuttled the idea. The CBC and NFB filmed the Tattoo as did the Military. Tattoo 1967 was the largest undertaking by the military during peace time and has never been reproduced since. The Tattoo depicted the military history of Canada from the first French military and settlers in Canada in 1665 right up to Canada's UN Peace Keeping role in 1967.\n\nChallenge for Change (in Quebec \"Societé Nouvelle\") was a participatory film and video project created by the National Film Board of Canada in 1967 as a response to the Centennial. Active until 1980, Challenge for Change used film and video production to illuminate the social concerns of various communities within Canada, with funding from eight different departments of the Canadian government. The impetus for the program was the belief that film and video were useful tools for initiating social change and eliminating poverty.\n\nIn Toronto, the Caribana parade and festival was launched in 1967 as a celebration of Caribbean culture, and as a gift from Canada's West Indian community in tribute to the Centennial year. In November 1967, the \"Confederation of Tomorrow\" conference was held at the newly built Toronto-Dominion Bank Tower. Called by Ontario Premier John Robarts, the summit of provincial premiers led to a new round of federal-provincial negotiations to amend the Canadian Constitution.\n\nThe Centennial Voyageur Canoe Pageant was a canoe race started on May 24 in the Rocky Mountains by ten teams representing eight provinces and the two territories. Two provinces were not entered. 3,283 miles were paddled and portaged in 104 days by 100 men using six man shifts per team. They arrived in Montreal on September 4. Other privately sponsored canoes from across the country made similar trips.\n\nIn addition to these major projects there were commemorative projects throughout the country. Municipal funding for approved centennial projects was matched dollar for dollar by both the province and the federal government. Providing a concrete reminder of the centennial year celebrations these projects included the 1,500 seat Norbrock Stadium in Kamloops, British Columbia to the National Arts Centre in Ottawa, and many others. Approximately $25 million was made available by the Centennial Committee for local projects.\n\nThe 1967 International and Universal Exposition, or Expo 67 as it was commonly known, was the general exhibition, Category One World's Fair held in Montreal from April 27 to October 29, 1967. Expo 67 was Canada's main celebration during the centennial year.\n\nIn a political and cultural context, Expo 67 was seen as a landmark moment in Canadian history. Expo 67 in particular was a signifier of the nation's mood of extreme optimism and confidence on heading into its second century. In retrospect, the centennial is seen as a high point of Canadian aspirations prior to the anxious decade of the 1970s that saw the nation divided over issues relating to inflation, an economic recession, government budget deficits and Quebec separatism. Popular Canadian historian Pierre Berton referred to the centennial as \"the last good year\" in his book \"\".\n\nIn 1961, Prime Minister John Diefenbaker proposed a travelling exhibit on a train that would traverse the country and bring exhibits on the history of Canada to the citizens. The train consisted of six exhibit cars and seven cars for staff and equipment pulled by two diesel locomotives, one from each from Canadian Pacific Railway and Canadian National Railway. The locomotives were painted in purple, grey, and black livery and had a custom air horn that sounded the first four notes of \"O Canada.\" The train was inaugurated on January 9, 1967 in Victoria and made 83 stops across the country before reaching its final stop in Montreal on December 5, 1967.\n\nThe Bank of Canada issued into circulation a redesigned version of the $1 banknote from the 1954 Series. The image on the reverse of this version shows the original Parliament Buildings, and the obverse includes a green monochrome adaptation of the stylised maple leaf Centennial logo marked with the years 1867 and 1967. Two variants of the design were printed; the first had the serial number at the top of the obverse, whereas the second and more common variant had the years 1867 and 1967 printed twice flanking the apex of the coat of arms.\n\nThe Canadian Centennial Medal was issued in 1967 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Confederation of Canada, and was awarded to Canadians who were recommended by governments and associations for having provided valuable service to this country. Some 30,000 Medals were conferred on Canadians selected from all sectors of Canadian society.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "35202684", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35202684", "title": "Comparing Media Systems", "text": "Comparing Media Systems\n\nComparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics (2004), by Daniel C. Hallin and Paolo Mancini, is a seminal study in the field of international comparative media system research. The study compares media systems of 18 Western democracies including nine Northern European countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland), five Southern European countries (France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain) and four Atlantic countries (Canada, Great Britain, Ireland, and the United States).\n\nThe conceptual framework developed in this study turned out to be an important contribution to the field of the comparative media systems research because it provides a systematic and applicable approach to analyze differences and similarities of the relationships between media and politics.\n\nSince the publication of Hallin and Mancini’s book in 2004, there has been a vivid academic discussion (Recent developments), particularly with regards to the adequacy of their suggested framework for understanding variations between different systems around the world, located within different cultural, social, and/or political contexts. As a consequence, a flourishing progression within the field of comparative media system research can be stated.\n\nThe field of comparative media system research has a long tradition reaching back to the study \"Four Theories of the Press\" by Siebert, Peterson and Schramm from 1956. This book was the origin of the academic debate on comparing and classifying media systems, whereas it was normatively biased and strongly influenced by the ideologies of the Cold War era. Though this approach has often been criticized (e.g. because of its ethnocentricity, inconsistent structure, questionable typologies, or its scant empirical basis of the analysis), it was a starting point for following normative media theories and the development of the field.\n\nComparative media system research has been subject to several changes since its establishment. The number of categories to describe media systems grew and approaches got more complex. Another trend is that researchers factor in political systems more intensively to explain and compare media systems. A more fundamental development is the shift from normative to empirically based approaches.\n\nThere are still problems of comparative media studies in various countries which must be faced. The validity of the country sampling procedure is one problem, beside the adequate definition of the scope of the comparison to meet the specific national features of the cases, and the definition of adequate indicators as the basis for the comparison. Additionally, the developed models are still relatively static not being able to describe changes adequately, and online media have been largely neglected though their importance has been increasing since the late 1990s.\n\nHowever, comparative media system studies are an important instrument for contemporary communication phenomena under study. The comparative design is a bridge between traditional and nation-centered studies of media systems and new media as well as globalization perspectives. Jakubowicz points out that contemporarily comparative media system analyses are seen as the key approach to understand globalization processes of the media.\n\nComparative media system research is one possible approach to study transnational and border-crossing communication processes worldwide. A very useful and heuristic systematization of the vast field of transnational and border-crossing communication comes from Wessler and Brüggemann (2012) (see also Dimensions of analysis). According to this heuristic, the approach from Hallin and Mancini can be identified and localized as one specific combination of the components along these three dimensions of analysis. Their perspective of analysis is focused on a systematic comparison of media systems within Western democracies. Consequently, their level of analysis concentrates on media systems within the context of nation states. Their main objectives are media-politics relations primarily on the level of structures, but in addition to it, they consider all objects of analysis to gain an encompassing understanding of these relations.\n\nDeveloping a unifying conceptual framework for comparing media systems was essential for Hallin and Mancini. They focused on theory building rather than testing theories, as the then prevailing \"Four Theories of the Press\" and its subsequent normative modifications showed deficiencies in adequately analyzing present media systems. Consequently, Hallin and Mancini focused on an empirical “by treating these systems not as abstract ideals but as concrete social formations that developed under particular historical conditions.”\nHallin and Mancini initially chose a “most similar systems”-design – that is, comparing systems which are quite similar according to their structures and functioning to understand in which aspects they differ from each other to discover specific characteristics of each single system. Following this design, they conceptualized dimensions containing particular variables to analyze similarities and differences between the 18 countries under study. Their objective was to find more or less coherent patterns within their sample which could possibly be condensed into ideal types in terms of Max Weber’s conception of ideal types. Since the dimensions and the resulting models cover specifically the media-politics relations of the Western world, Hallin and Mancini do not claim universal validity of their framework. Hence, it must be reconceptualized to meet the specific conditions of media-politics relations beyond the Western world.\n\nHallin and Mancini’s conceptual framework consists of the \"structure of media markets\", \"political parallelism\", \"professionalization of journalism\", and the \"role of the state\" with regards to media systems; and of the the \"role of the state\", \"type of democracy\" (consensus vs. majoritarian), \"type of pluralism\" (individual vs. organized), \"degree of rational-legal authority\", and \"degree of pluralism\" (moderate vs. polarized) with reference to the political contexts of media systems. According to specific constellations of the variables within these dimensions, Hallin and Mancini conceptualized the three models of media and politics.\n\nThe structure of media markets is concerned with the development of a mass press. The authors highlight several variables which can be used to describe the characteristics of press systems: \n\nPolitical parallelism refers to the “fact that media in some countries have distinct political orientations, while media in other countries do not.” The authors established 5 factors or indicators to assess the extent of political parallelism:\n\nThe professionalization refers to the continuum of independent to instrumentalized journalism:\n\nThis dimension stresses the power the political system has in shaping the structure and functioning of a media system. “But there are considerable differences in the extent of state intervention as well as in the forms it takes.” Hallin and Mancini use the following variables to cover this fourth dimension:\n\nUltimately, the interrelations of these four dimensions are complex. They have to be assessed empirically for every new case under study. Consequently, they may “influence one another in important ways, but also vary independently.”\n\nIn a next step, Hallin and Mancini identified five core dimensions to assess the political contexts of media systems. They took relevant concepts from the literatures on comparative politics and political sociology to gain a better understanding of the political influences on the development of media systems. The resulting dimensions are presented as dichotomies, but they are just poles on a continuum.\n\nThe first dimension is the role of the state. It is conceptualized by the distinction between \"liberal democracies\" and \"welfare state democracies\". The main difference between these two categories is the interventional activity of the state (e.g. funding vs. free market). This difference takes shape in the relative importance of private business or social institutions within the political system in question.\n\nA further important dichotomic dimension is labeled consensus vs. majoritarian democracy. Majoritarian democratic systems contain two dominating parties and, due to the plurality voting system, the winning party actually concentrates the political power so that there is a clear distinction between the government and the opposition. Furthermore, the Cabinet predominantly influences political decision processes. By contrast, the consensus politics model encompasses a multi-party system which is based on the power sharing principle according to the proportional representation so that compromise and cooperation between the opposing forces are central. Additionally, there is a separation of power between legislative and executive.\n\nThe third dimension is the distinction between individual and organized pluralism resp. liberalism and corporatism. Individual pluralism is defined as the organization of the political representation “in terms of the relation between governing institutions and individual citizens, along with a multiplicity of competing ‘special interests’”. On the other hand, the focus on organized social groups is more important within organized pluralism systems. Thus, corporatism includes the “formal integration of social groups into the political process”.\n\nHallin and Mancini identify the distinction between rational-legal authority and clientelism as another crucial dimension. Following Max Weber, Hallin and Mancini use the term rational-legal authority in its meaning as a form of governance whose main influence is maintained through formal and universalistic rules of procedure, i.e. an independent and autonomous administrative apparatus not affected by political and economic interests or lobbyism. This apparatus is the main institution of an efficient rational-legal system. In contrast, the orientation on common interests is much weaker within clientelism systems because individual interests and private relationships are the main forces maintaining the social organization. Consequently, “access to social resources is controlled by patrons and delivered to clients in exchange for deference and various forms of support”.\n\nThe final dimension is conceptualized by the distinction between moderate and polarized pluralism. Low consensus, challenged legitimacy of the political organizations or system, and deep cleavages within the political landscape are the main characteristics of polarized pluralism. An important indicator is the existence of anti-system parties and factions. Compared to this, moderate pluralism is mainly characterized by stronger tendencies toward the center, lower ideological differences between the political parties, greater acceptance of the political system, and better chances to gain consensus during political controversies.\n\nBy using the aforementioned dimensions, Hallin and Mancini deduced and conceptualized three ideal models of media-politics relations (‘ideal’ according to Max Weber). Hallin and Mancini could identify specific patterns by geographical regions which were crucial for labeling the individual models:\n\nHallin and Mancini point to restrictions of their three models which have to be considered in order not to overvalue the validity and significance of them. First of all, they focus on nation states and this level of analysis allows a specific perspective on media-politics relations but misses other phenomena of importance (e.g. transnational developments of media markets in Europe). Another concern is that the cases summarized within the single models vary enormously (especially within the Liberal model). Consequently, the models show a wide range of cases which might blur their distinction. Furthermore, the media systems within the analyzed countries might not be homogeneous (e.g. the structural differences between the print system and the broadcasting system in Germany). Because of the differences within the countries and the interferences between them, it is difficult to treat the 18 countries analyzed, as single cases because they depend on each other and influence each other. A final point is the dynamic of media systems because they cannot be assumed as static entities. Hence, media systems will always progress and there will always be changes resulting from those developing processes, so that reconsidering the characteristics of the mentioned models becomes necessary over time.\nConsequently, Hallin and Mancini point out in subsequent discussions that their models are not intended to be universal typologies which can be applied to other cases mechanically. Instead, they suggest rather focusing on the dimensions and their applicability and adaption to analyze other media systems adequately – e.g. regarding Eastern European media systems, they propose to attach more weight to the role of the state and especially to the role of civil society to understand these systems appropriately.\n\nAt the end of their book, Hallin and Mancini discuss the convergence- or homogenization-thesis. The basis for their argument is their observation of several transformation processes that take place especially in Europe. The most important processes are the European integration, politically as well as with regards to the media (e.g. European media laws), the decline of traditional political mass parties, the American influence on the professionalization of journalism, and finally the commercialization of the media markets in Europe. These are the main reasons why Hallin and Mancini conclude, that the European countries might be pushed toward the \"Liberal model\". They even go one step further and hypothesize that the core forces of that homogenization- or convergence-process might be valid for other parts of the world. However, they point out that there might be limitations to this process as well because the elements of the process are anchored in the structural differences between the political systems around the world.\n\nIn this section, some recent issues and topics are mentioned because they arose from an ongoing scholar discussion about the applicability of Hallin and Mancini’s framework to other, especially non-Western countries:\n\nThis vivid discussion reflects the status of Hallin and Mancini’s approach, as it is currently “the most well-developed analytical framework so far for understanding the relationship between media and political systems.” Consequently, there are many studies that apply and adapt the framework for their cases under study.\n\nFor example, Dobek-Ostrowska and colleagues published the edited volume \"Comparative Media Systems. European and Global Perspectiv\"e (2010) which contains comparative studies referring to or applying Hallin and Mancini’s framework for Central and Eastern Europe media systems. Hallin and Mancini published the edited volume \"Comparing Media Systems Beyond the Western World\" (2012) which gives a comprehensive overview with a more global perspective. Case studies from the media systems of Israel, Poland, Baltic states, Brazil, South Africa, Russia, China, and the Arab world are discussed by the contributors and a methodological reflection of Hallin and Mancini’s framework with regards to non-Western media systems is added.\n\nFurther research was conducted by Jonathan Hardy, who analyzed the implications of transformation processes shaping contemporary media systems. As Hallin and Mancini did, Hardy focuses on media systems within Western democracies (actually 18 countries) and he adjoins their convergence thesis while he concentrates on print and broadcasting (especially TV). He chooses four paradigms (namely the liberal democratic theory, neoliberalism, libertarianism, and the critical political economy) as an analytical framework to examine relationships between media and politics, media and policy, media ownership and transnationalisation processes.\n\nFurthermore, Roger Blum’s approach (2005) is an attempt to broaden and complete Hallin and Mancini’s models by adding and modifying dimensions (he developed nine instead of four dimensions), classifying them as liberal, regulated, or as in between these two poles. Blum identifies six models of media systems, but he does “not explain how he created the models and why no other combination of specification is necessary”, so Blum’s framework is still in need for empirical support.\n\nOther studies focus on a single aspect of Hallin and Mancini’s framework and analyze it in detail. For example, Curran and his colleagues (2009) study the implications of the movement towards rather market-driven media and compare news contents and public knowledge of public affairs within different media systems by testing the hypothesis, “that market-based systems (…) impede the exercise of informed citizenship.”\nThere were also several conferences “triggered” by Hallin and Mancini’s framework; for example the \"International Media and Communication Conference “Comparing Media Systems: West Meets East”\" organized by the Department of Communication and Journalism at the University of Wroclaw (April 23–25, 2007), where more than 100 researchers attained or conferences initiated by Hallin and Mancini themselves in Perugia in 2007, and in San Diego in 2009.\n\nComparative media system research is an encouraging and important subfield of mediated cross-border communication. And Hallin and Mancini’s framework has been contributing to its consolidation and progression.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1896889", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896889", "title": "Critical management studies", "text": "Critical management studies\n\nCritical management studies (CMS) is a loose but extensive grouping of theoretically informed critiques of management, business and organisation, grounded originally in a critical theory perspective. Today it encompasses a wide range of perspectives that are critical of traditional theories of management and the business schools that generate these theories.\n\nIt is generally accepted that CMS began with Mats Alvesson and Hugh Willmott's edited collection \"Critical Management Studies\" (1992). Critical Management Studies (CMS) initially brought together critical theory and post-structuralist writings, but has since developed in more diverse directions.\n\nA dominant narrative within CMS is that perhaps the most important development in its stimulation was the global expansion of business schools, an American invention, especially in Europe. Decreases in state funding, so the narrative has it, for social sciences and increases in funding for business schools during the 1980s resulted in many academics with graduate training in sociology, history, philosophy, psychology and other social sciences ending up with jobs \"training managers\".\n\nThese academics brought different theoretical tools and political perspectives into business schools. They began to question the politics of managerialism and to link the techniques of management to neo-liberalism. These new voices drew on the Frankfurt School of critical theory, and the work of Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida and Gilles Deleuze. Later Feminism, queer theory, post-colonial theory, anarchism, ecological philosophies, and radical democratic theory also had some influence. (See Alvesson and Willmott 2003 for a survey of the field.)\n\nThe roots of CMS also came from a series of UK Labour Process Conferences that began in 1983 and reflected the impact of Braverman's (1974) attempt to make Marxist categories central to understanding work organisations. Industrial relations and labor studies scholars have joined the CMS fold in the US, seeking new opportunities for employment as labor-related programs have diminished in number.\n\nAt the same time a significant strand of critical accounting studies began to develop marked by the publication of Tony Tinker's \"Paper Prophets\" (1985) and the appearance of the journal \"Critical Perspectives on Accounting\".\n\nContrasting with the dominant origin narrative is an account which states that, along with the contributors to CMS from the intellectual traditions identified here, there is a significant - and overlapping - bloc among CMS scholars of those who have had extensive pre-University experience as workers and managers. The inconsistencies between their experiences in the workplace and the claims of mainstream managerialism, and an intention to connect those experiences to broader explanations and theorizing leads these people to CMS.\n\nThe main home of CMS has been in the organisation theory and behaviour parts of British, Australian and Scandinavian business schools, though there are strong contributions in related fields such as sociology, sociology of education, and critical pedagogy. Further, contributions stem from accounting with growing interest in other management specialisms, such as marketing, international business, operational research, logistics etc. Since the 1990s academics from North America and other parts of the world are also engaging with this body of writing and research. The CMS Division within the (American) Academy of Management (AoM), with a membership of around 800, is larger and more international than some of its other divisions.\n\nMany heterodox scholars in various parts of the world had been inspired by the international activities of the Standing Conference on Organisational Symbolism. This latter grouping developed work which drew variously on post-structuralism and symbolic interactionism in order to develop a cultural and anthropological understanding of contemporary organizations. Others, though, were without affiliation and/or seeking new formations and alliances. Since 1999, there has been a bi-annual CMS conference held in the UK as well as workshops and a bi-annual conference held at US Academy of Management.\n\nToday there are significant concentrations of CMS scholars in the UK at the School of Business and Management at Queen Mary, University of London, at the School of Management at the University of Leicester, the Essex Business School at the University of Essex, Alliance Manchester Business School at the University of Manchester, and the Marketing Research Group at Royal Holloway. Elsewhere, Copenhagen Business School, Lund School of Economics and Management at Lund University and Istanbul Bilgi University have clusters of CMS scholars, but many CMS scholars globally rely on conferences and journals like \"Tamara Journal for Critical Organization Studies\", \"ephemera: theory and politics in organization\", \"Culture and Organization\", or \"Organization: the critical journal of organization, theory and society\" for their affiliations.\n\nMajor points of debate have focused on the relationship with more orthodox forms of Marxism, the nature and purposes of CMS critique, as well as on questions of inclusion and exclusion (Fournier and Grey 2000), the possibilities of social transformation from within business schools (Parker 2002), and the development of alternative models of globalisation.\n\nOne trend in CMS has seen the incorporation of autonomist Marxist theory, first introduced in the English-speaking world by the work of Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri (2000). New CMS scholars using these theories have interests in proposing alternative non-capitalist forms of organizing work and life - often around the notion of collective responsibility for the commons. Other developments include engagements with post-colonial theory and critical race theory to investigate the way management and business schools contribute to what Cedric Robinson (1983) has called \"racial capitalism\". Recent critical works have referred to Bourdieusian theory (structuralist constructivism) to point to the risks of elitism and social inequality, particularly in management education. Michael Loughlin of Manchester Metropolitan University has discussed aspects of management theory as \"pseudo-science\".\n\nWider impatience with market-managerial forms of organization occur commonly enough outside the business school, from anti-corporate protest to popular-media presentations of managers. CMS attempts to articulate these voices within the business school, and to provide ways of thinking beyond current dominant theories and practices of organizations.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "47297065", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47297065", "title": "De fato", "text": "De fato\n\nCicero's De fato (Latin, \"Concerning Fate\") is a partially lost philosophical treatise written in 44 BC. Only two-thirds of the work exists; the beginning and ending are missing. It takes the form of a dialogue, although it reads more like an exposition, whose interlocutors are Cicero and his friend Aulus Hirtius.\n\nIn the work, Cicero analyzes the concept of Fate, and suggests that free will is a condition of Fate. Cicero, however, does not consciously deal with the distinction between fatalism and determinism.\n\nIt appears that \"De Fato\" is an appendix to the treatise on theology formed by the three books of \"De Natura Deorum\" and the two books of \"De Divinatione\". These three books provide important information regarding Stoic cosmology and theology.\n\n\"De fato\" is part of the second group of Cicero's writings. The work was composed at Pozzuoli between April 17th and May 23rd of 44 BC. In any case, the work would have most likely been completed prior to Cicero's abortive departure for Greece in July of that year. The work was written in haste, as Cicero was planning to return to the political arena.\n\nHirtius notes that Cicero has adopted the Academic method of investigation: arguing against all propositions. Therefore, he outlines the positions of Democritus, Heraclitus, Empedocles, and Aristotle as those who maintained that everything happens by necessity. As such Cicero develops the propositions of fate and necessity as follows:\n\nCicero essentially dismisses this proposition as antithetical to what is observed, but postulates freedom as a necessity for moral life. Ultimately, Cicero maintains this position as he is emotionally convinced that it is in man's power to achieve virtue for himself; if determinism were the order of things, then such ability would not be true.\n\n\n"}

The words are in Somali, and were written by Aden Elmi. The melody was composed by Abdi Robleh.\n\nThe anthem was first officially played at an independence ceremony on June 27, 1977.\n\nThematically, Elmi's lyrics reference the country's flag as it relates to Djibouti's struggle for independence. The French had staked claim to the region known as French Somaliland in the mid-1800s. For the next century, the region was overseen by a series of French governors. The area served as a backdrop for French battles with various opponents including Russia and Italy.\n\nIn 1958, a referendum was held in Djibouti to decide whether or not to join the Somali Republic or to remain with France. The referendum turned out in favour of a continued association with France, but there were reports of vote rigging, with the French expelling thousands of Somalis before the referendum reached the polls. In August 1960, an official visit to the territory by then French President, General Charles de Gaulle, was also met with demonstrations and rioting.\nOn 19 March 1967, a second plebiscite was held. Similar to the 1959 referendum, voting was also divided along ethnic lines, with the resident Somalis generally voting for independence, with the goal of eventual reunion with Somalia, and the Afars largely opting to remain associated with France. There were again reports of vote rigging on the part of the French authorities.Announcement of the results sparked civil unrest, including several deaths. France also increased its military force along the frontier. Soon after, the territory was renamed French Territory of the Afars and Issas, but a growing Somali and Afar population united led to a vote for independence in 1977, officially marking Djibouti's independence.\n\nThe melody by Abdi Robleh is written in common 4/4 time. It consists of twenty measures. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "178878", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=178878", "title": "Eton wall game", "text": "Eton wall game\n\nThe Eton wall game is a game which bears some resemblance to rugby union that originated at and is still played at Eton College. It is played on a strip of ground 5 metres wide and 110 metres long (\"The Furrow\") next to a slightly curved brick wall (\"The Wall\") erected in 1717.\n\nThe traditional and most important match of the year is played on St Andrew's Day, as the Collegers (King's Scholars) take on the Oppidans (the rest of the school). Although College has only 70 boys to pick from, compared to the 1250 or so Oppidans, the Collegers have one distinct advantage: access to the field on which the Wall Game is played is controlled by a Colleger. Despite this, it is usual for them to allow the Oppidans to use it whenever they wish.\nAt the annual St Andrew's Day match, the Oppidans climb over the wall, after throwing their caps over in defiance of the Scholars, while the Collegers march down from the far end of College Field, arm-in-arm, towards the near end, where they meet the Oppidans.\n\nThe Wall Game is also played on Ascension Day, immediately after a 6 a.m. service on the roof of College Chapel. Various scratch matches are also played throughout the Michaelmas and Lent halves (terms), where boys from different year groups, as well as masters, take part.\n\nThe aim of the game is to move the ball towards the opponents' end of the playing area. In those last few yards of the field is an area called the \"calx\". In this area a player can earn a \"shy\" (worth one point) by lifting the ball against the wall with his foot. A teammate then touches the ball with his hand and shouts \"Got it!\" These two plays must happen within the calx. After this, if the umpire says \"Given\", the scoring team can attempt a goal (worth a further nine points) by throwing the ball at a designated target (a garden door at one end of the field and a tree at the other end). A player can also score a kicked goal, worth five points, if he kicks the ball out and it hits a goal during the normal course of play.\n\nThe main game consists of the two sets of players forming a rugby-style scrummage (called a \"Bully\") in which neither team may \"furk\" the ball, which is to hook it backwards (except in Calx, where a different type of Bully called a Calx Bully occurs). The Bully is formed next to the Wall and crabs slowly along the Wall until the ball emerges. Many players, particularly those whose position is actually against the Wall, lose the skin off their elbows, hips and knees. Because of this, players usually wear long sleeves. Players within the Bully shove and push each other, mostly with their bodies but also by placing their fists against the faces of the opposition and attempting to lever them backwards and away from the Wall. Actual punching is not permitted, and grabbing an opponent's shirt (\"holding\") is also not allowed.\n\nThe fastest way to make ground is by kicking the ball upfield and out of play whenever it comes sideways out of the Bully; unlike most types of football, play is restarted opposite where the ball stops after it had gone out, or was touched after it had gone out.\n\nConsequently, the most common tactic revolves around the formation of a 'phalanx'. This consists of a tunnel (coming out from the wall, diagonally forward from the position of the ball) of players from one team who are crouching on hands and feet next to each other. Once the team in possession of the ball has formed a successful phalanx, it attempts to pass the ball down the 'tunnel' using the knees of the players forming it, to a player standing at the end of the phalanx (i.e. furthest away from the Wall), known as Lines, whose job it is to kick the ball upfield. The team not in possession is constantly attempting to disrupt this, and win the ball back.\n\nThe game lasts up to 55 minutes, with two halves of 25 minutes each and an additional 5 minutes as half-time break. Many games end 0-0. Goals (worth ten points) are very rare; they occur about once every 10 years, and no goals have been scored in the St Andrew's Day game since 1909. A goal was scored in a recent scratch match (a less formal warm-up match for the St Andrew's Day game) in May 2016 by a College player. However, shies (worth 1 point) are scored more frequently.\n\nIn the 2016 game, the 250th St. Andrew's Day match, College triumphed 1–0 against the Oppidans. This was the 107th consecutive St Andrew's Day match in which no goals were scored by either team; however, College scored a shy.\n\nThe Wall Game is organised entirely by boys, particularly by the Keepers (captains) of College Wall, Oppidan Wall and Mixed Wall. Famous past players of the Wall Game include Boris Johnson, who was Keeper of the College Wall, George Orwell and Harold Macmillan. The First World War flying ace Arthur Rhys Davids also played, representing College with Ralph Dominic Gamble in 1915.\n\nMembers of the College Wall also annually commemorate the outstanding player and Keeper of the Wall Logie Leggatt, who was killed in the First World War at the age of 22, making a toast at each year's Christmas Sock Supper with the words \"in piam memoriam L.C.L\" (in affectionate memory of L.C.L). Despite its renown outside the school, only a very small number of the 250 or so boys in each year group ever take part in the sport, unlike the lesser-known but much more widely played Eton Field Game.\n\nThe Eton Wall Game has been played twice by all-female teams.\n\nIn 1948, the game was televised by the BBC. When shared by the BBC Archive on social media in 2017, it was described as \"baffling\", and the televising as \"rubbish\".\n\nThe British sitcom \"Green Wing\" features a fictional game, Guyball (), which parodies the obscurity of public school pastimes such as the Eton wall game. It is introduced by Guy Secretan, who learned the sport at the fictional school Whiteleaf (). The object of the game is to throw balls in a \"Topmiler\", a wicker basket on top of a leather flying helmet. However, the rules of Guyball are never fully explained and are designed to be as confusing and as difficult to understand as possible. Fans of the show have however created their own rules, and the game was occasionally played 'for real'.\n\nIn Terry Pratchett's Discworld series, the Ankh-Morpork Assassins' Guild has a far more sadistic variant of the \"Wall Game\", and is essentially an extreme hybrid of rock-climbing and dodgeball.\n\nIn the first of Charlie Higson's Young Bond novels, \"SilverFin\", the young James Bond comes to Eton and learns the rules of the Wall Game.\n\nThe game was a subject of the 1987 book, \"The Sports Hall of Shame\", by Bruce Nash and Allan Zullo.\n\nRobert Ludlum's novel \"The Bancroft Strategy\" briefly describes the game, saying \"I believe the last time a goal was scored on a St. Andrew's day match was in 1909, if you can believe it.\"\n\nFrederick Forsyth's novel The Cobra has a passing reference to the Wall Game.\n\nLen Deighton's nameless protagonist in \"The IPCRESS File\", in passing, compares the scene boarding an aeroplane to the Eton Wall Game.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "89805", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=89805", "title": "European dragon", "text": "European dragon\n\nEuropean dragons are legendary creatures in folklore and mythology among the overlapping cultures of Europe.\n\nIn both the modern period and ancient period, the European dragon is typically depicted as a large, fire-breathing, scaly, horned, lizard-like creature; the creature also has leathery, bat-like wings, four legs, and a long, muscular prehensile tail. Some depictions show dragons with feathered wings, crests, ear frills, fiery manes, ivory spikes running down its spine, and various exotic decorations.\n\nIn folktales, dragon's blood often contains unique powers, keeping them alive for longer or giving them poisonous or acidic properties. The typical Christian dragon protects a cavern or castle filled with gold and treasure. An evil dragon is often associated with a great hero who tries to slay it, and a good one is said to give support or wise advice.\n\nThough a winged creature, the dragon is generally to be found in its underground lair, a cave that identifies it as an ancient creature of earth.\n\nEnglish \"dragon\" derives (via Middle English, Old French, and Latin) from Ancient Greek δράκων \"drákōn\", \"serpent, dragon\" or literally \"to see\" i.e. \"sharp-sighted one\". The Greek word probably derives from an Aryan base \"derk-\" meaning \"to see\" and the Sanskrit \"dŗç-\" also signifying \"to see\". Notwithstanding their folkloric associations, there is no etymological connection between \"dragons\" and the ghoulish figures known as draugar in Old Norse, who haunt rich burial mounds.\n\nRoman dragons evolved from serpentine Greek ones, combined with the dragons of the Near East, in the mix that characterized the hybrid Greek/Eastern Hellenistic culture. From Babylon, the \"muš-ḫuššu\" was a classic representation of a Near Eastern dragon. John's \"Book of Revelation\"—Greek literature, not Roman—describes Satan as \"a great dragon, flaming red, with seven heads and ten horns\". Much of John's literary inspiration is late Hebrew and Greek, but John's dragon is more likely to be symbolizing the dragons from the Near East. In the Roman Empire, each military cohort had a particular identifying \"signum\" (military standard), after the Parthian and Dacian Wars of Trajan in the east, the Dacian Draco military standard entered the Legion with the \"Cohors Sarmatarum\" and \"Cohors Dacorum\" (Sarmatian and Dacian cohorts)—a large dragon fixed to the end of a lance, with large, gaping jaws of silver and with the rest of the body formed of colored silk. With the jaws facing into the wind, the silken body inflated and rippled, resembling a windsock.\n\nSeveral personifications of evil or allusions to dragon in the Old Testament are translated as forms of \"draco\" in Jerome's Vulgate. e.g Deuteronomy (32:33), Job (30:29), Psalms (73:13, 90:13 & 43:20), Isaiah (13:21, 27:1, 34:13 & 43:20), Jeremiah (9:11), Micah (1:8) and Malachi (1:3).\n\nDragons in Greek mythology often guard treasure such as Ladon, a hundred headed dragon which guarded the tree of Herdias until he was slain by Heracles. Likewise Python guarded the oracle of Delphi until he was likewise slain by Apollo out of revenge for Python tormenting his mother. The Lerneaen Hydra, a multiple headed serpentine swamp monster is said to be a dragon, being killed by Heracles later, but the matter if he is a true dragon or not is still over controversy.\n\nDragons are usually shown in modern times with a body more like a huge lizard, or a snake with two pairs of lizard-type legs, and able to emit fire from their mouths. This traces back to the continental dragon, commonly referred to as a fire-breathing dragon. The continental, like many other European dragons, has bat-like wings growing from its back.\n\nIn Western folklore, dragon-like creatures and christian dragons are usually portrayed as evil, with the exceptions mainly in Asturian and Welsh folklore and modern fiction. In the modern period and late medieval times, the European dragon is typically depicted as a huge fire-breathing, scaly, and horned lizard-like creature, with (leathery, bat-like) wings, with two to four legs and a long muscular tail. It is sometimes shown with feathered wings, a crest, a fiery mane, ivory spikes running down its spine and various exotic colorations. Dragon's blood often has magical properties. The typical dragon protects a cavern or castle filled with gold and treasure and is often associated with a great hero who tries to slay it. Though a winged creature, the dragon is generally to be found in its underground lair, a cave that identifies it as an ancient creature of earth.\n\nClassical European dragons are often described as illuminating the air. This is often taken by Christian writers as a metaphor for Lucifer as the \"angel of light\".\n\nThe poem \"Beowulf\" describes a \"draca\" (dragon) also as \"wyrm\" (worm, or serpent) and its movements by the Anglo-Saxon verb \"bugan\", \"to bend\", and says that it has a venomous bite; all of these indicate a snake-like form and movement rather than with a lizard-like or dinosaur-like body as in later belief (though the dragon of Beowulf does show several features that would later become popularized with dragons–namely, it breathes fire–lives underground, and collects treasure).\n\nThe most famous lindworm in Norse and Germanic mythology is Fafnir\n\nThe Germanic stories of lindworms have them guarding a treasure hoard. The Fafnir lindworm guarded earthen mounds full of ancient treasure. The treasure was cursed and brought ill to those who later possessed it.\n\nSea serpents are also called orms in Nordic languages, wyrms in Old English and worms in Middle English.\nThese \"dragons\" are usually evil, much like dragon-like creatures of Greece and other dragons of Continental Europe; however, there are exceptions, and many do not want to go to battle unless they feel threatened. These serpents are limbless and wingless. The most famous sea serpent in Norse mythology is Jörmungandr, who is actually a giant born into the body of a serpent by the Norse god Loki, who will one day kill Thor, Norse god of thunder.\n\nThe red dragon features on, and is the name of the national flag of Wales (\"Y Ddraig Goch\"). The symbol may originate in Arthurian Legend, or more likely from the Celtic dragon God Dewi (not to be confused for Saint David by later Christian era). Employed by Gwrtheyrn, Merlin tells of a vision of the red dragon (representing the Britons) and the white dragon (representing the invading Saxons) fighting beneath Dinas Emrys. This particular legend also features in the Mabinogion in the story of \"Lludd and Llefelys\".\n\nThe Dragon was used as a predominant symbol of Welsh leaders throughout history, such as Owain Glyndŵr and Henry VII of England.\n\nIn south Slavic mythology there are two types of this dragon-like creatures, alas and zmeys. It is said that a very old snake can become and metamorph into an ala. Some depictions of alas are confusingly said to have the bodies of women. Other alas look similarly to dragons. The number of heads on an ala may vary. Alas are enemies of the zmeys and it is sometimes said in south Slavic folklore that thunder is a product of alas and zmeys fighting. Alas are considered evil or malevolent in south Slavic folklore, while zmeys are usually considered good or benevolent.\n\nDragon-like creatures of Slavic mythology hold mixed temperaments towards humans. For example, Drakons (дракон, змей, ламя, (х)ала) in Bulgarian mythology are either male or female, each gender having a different view of mankind. The female dragon and male dragon, often seen as sister and brother, represent different forces of agriculture. The female dragon represents harsh weather and is the destroyer of crops, the hater of mankind, and is locked in a never-ending battle with her brother. The male dragon protects the humans' crops from destruction and is generally benevolent to humanity. Fire and water play major roles in Bulgarian dragon lore: the female has water characteristics, while the male is usually a fiery creature. In Bulgarian legend, The drakons are three-headed, winged beings with snake's bodies, in other words wyvern fuses with a green hydra.\n\nIn Bulgarian, Russian, Belarusian, Ukrainian, Bosnian, Serbian, and Macedonian lore, the dragon-like creature, or \"змей\" (), \"zmey\" (), \"smok\" (), \"zmiy\" (), (Bosnian zmaj), (), \"zmej\" (), is generally an evil, four-legged beast with few, if any, redeeming qualities. \"Zmeys\" are intelligent, but not greatly so, often demanding tribute from villages or small towns in the form of maidens (for food), or gold. Their number of heads ranges from one to seven or sometimes even more, with three- and seven-headed Zmeys being most common. The heads also regrow if cut off, unless the neck is \"treated\" with fire (similar to the hydra in Greek mythology). Zmey blood is so poisonous that Earth itself will refuse to absorb it. In Bulgarian mythology these \"dragons\" are sometimes good, opposing the evil Lamya /ламя/, a beast that shares a likeness with the \"zmey\".\n\nThe most famous Polish dragon () is the Wawel Dragon or \"Smok Wawelski\", the Dragon of Wawel Hill. It supposedly terrorized ancient Kraków and lived in caves on the Vistula river bank below the Wawel castle. According to lore based on the \"Book of Daniel\", it was killed by a boy who offered it a sheepskin filled with sulphur and tar. After devouring it, the dragon became so thirsty that it finally exploded after drinking too much water. In the oldest, 12th-century version of this fantasy tale, written by Wincenty Kadłubek, dragon was defeated by two sons of a King Krak, Krakus II and Lech II. A metal sculpture of the Wawel Dragon is a well-known tourist sight in Kraków. The Wawel Dragon is the coat of arms of the Polish princes, Piasts of Czersk.\n\nOther dragon-like creatures in Polish folklore include the basilisk, living in cellars of Warsaw, and the Snake King from folk legends, though neither are explicitly dragons.\n\nIberian \"dragons\" are almost always evil, such as the Cuélebre, or Cuelebre, a giant winged serpent in the mythology of Asturias and Cantabria in the north of Spain. It usually lives in a cave, guards treasures and keeps nymph-like beings called \"xanas\" or \"anjanas\" as prisoners.\n\nThere is a legend that a \"dragon\" dwelled in the Peña Uruel mountain near Jaca saying that it could mesmerise people with its glance, so the young man who decided to kill the beast equipped himself with a shiny shield, such that the dragon's glance would be reflected. When the young man arrived at the cave where the dragon lived, he could kill it easily because the dragon mesmerised itself. This legend is very similar to the Greek myth of Medusa.\n\nHerensuge is the name given to the \"dragon\" in Basque mythology, meaning \"last serpent\". The most famous legend has St. Michael descend from Heaven to kill it, but only once did God agree to accompany him in person.\nSugaar, the Basque male god, is often associated with the serpent or dragon but able to take other forms as well. His name can be read as \"male serpent\".\n\nDragons are well-known in Catalan myths and legends, in no small part because St. George (Catalan \"Sant Jordi\") is the patron saint of Catalonia. Like most mythical reptiles, the Catalan dragon (Catalan \"drac\") is an enormous serpent-like creature with four legs and a pair of wings, or rarely, a two legged creature with a pair of wings, called a wyvern, which isn't a dragon. As in many other parts of the world, the dragon's face may be like that of some other animal, such as a lion or bull. As is common elsewhere, Catalan dragons are fire-breathers, and the dragon-fire is all-consuming. Catalan dragons also can emit a fetid odor, which can rot away anything it touches.\n\nThe Catalans also distinguish a \"víbria\" or \"vibra\" (cognate with English \"viper\" and \"wyvern\"), a female dragon-like creature with two prominent breasts, two claws & two wings and an eagle's beak. Dracs, Víbries and other mythological figures used to participate in correfocs during popular celebrations.\n\nIn Portuguese mythology, Coca is a female wyvern that battles Saint George on the Corpus Christi holiday. The fighting has a symbolic meaning: when the coca defeats Saint George the crops will be bad and there will be famine and death; when Saint George defeats the coca he cuts off her tongue and ears, the crops will have a good year and it announces prosperity. Still, she is called \"saint\" coca just as George is called saint, and the people cheer for her.\n\nAnother dragon called drago is also represented in Portuguese mythology and used to take part in celebrations during the Middle Ages.\n\nWyverns are usually evil in Italy, and there are many stories of wyverns being slain. Dragons also trick demons in Italian legends. The legend of Saint George and the wyvern is well known in Italy, but other saints are also depicted fighting wyverns. For instance, the first bishop of Forlì, Saint Mercurialis, was said to have killed a wyvern to save the city, so he is often depicted in the act of slaying a wyvern. Likewise, the first patron saint of Venice, Saint Theodore of Tyro, was a wyvern-slayer, and a statue representing his slaying of the wyvern still tops one of the two columns in St. Mark's square. St. Michael, the patron saint of paratroopers, is also frequently depicted slaying a wyvern.\n\nAccording to the Golden Legend, compiled by the Italian Jacobus de Voragine, Saint Margaret the Virgin was swallowed by Satan in the shape of a hydra, from whence she escaped alive when the cross she carried irritated the hydra's innards. The Golden Legend, in an atypical moment of scepticism, describes this last incident as \"apocryphal and not to be taken seriously\" (trans. Ryan, 1.369), which did not prevent the legend from being popular and getting artistic treatments.\n\nMore prevalent are the legends about dragons in Italy, particularly in Umbria. One of the most famous wyverns of Italian folklore is Thyrus, a wyvern that besieged Terni in the Middle Ages. One day, a young and brave knight of the noble House of Cittadini, tired of witnessing the death of his fellow citizens and depopulation of Terni, faced the wyvern and killed him. From that day, the town assumed the creature in its coat of arms, accompanied by a Latin inscription: \"Thyrus et amnis dederunt signa Teramnis\" (English translation: \"Thyrus and the river gave their insignia to [the city of] Terni\"), that stands under the banner of the town of Terni, honoring this legend.\n\nAnother poem tells of another dragon that lived near the village of Fornole, near Terni in the south of Umbria. Pope Sylvester I arrived in Umbria and freed the population of Fornole from the ferocity of the dragon, pacifying the dragon. Grateful for his deed, the population built a small church dedicated to the saint on the top of the mountain near the dragon's lair in the 13th century. In the apse of the church there is a fresco representing the iconography of the saint.\n\nIn England, to this day, a rampant red dragon (clutching a mace) is the heraldic symbol of the county of Somerset. The county once formed part of the early-medieval Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex in western England, which too bore a dragon, or wyvern (a two-legged dragon-like creature, as opposed to a four-legged dragon), as a symbol. The Wessex beast is usually colored gold in illustrations.\n\nAccording to the writer on heraldry Arthur Charles Fox-Davies, the red dragon of Wales on the flag originated with the standard of the 7th-century king, Cadwaladr, and was used as a supporter by the Tudor dynasty (who were of Welsh origin). Queen Elizabeth, however, preferring gold, changed the royal mantle and the dragon supporter from red to gold gules. There may be some doubt of the Welsh origin of the dragon supporter of the Royal arms, but it certainly was used by King Henry III.\n\nThe Welsh flag reads \"parti per fess Argent and Vert; a dragon Gules passant\". Welsh rugby teams include the Newport Gwent Dragons and the Cardiff City Blue Dragons.\n\nKing Peter IV of Aragon used a dragon on his helmet to show that he was the king of Aragon, as a heraldic pun (\"Rei d'Aragón\", \"dragón\").\nA dragon was used as the crest of the Greater Royal Coat of Arms of Portugal since at least the 14th century. Later, two wyverns were used as supporters of the shield of the Arms of Portugal. In the 19th century, King Peter IV of Portugal granted the city of Porto the incorporation of the dragon crest of the Royal Coat of arms in its municipal coat of arms, in gratitude for the support given to him by the city during the Liberal Wars. The badge of the FC Porto incorporates the old Porto municipal coat of arms with the dragon crest and this is why the dragon was adopted as the animal mascot of the club.\n\nBeta Theta Pi uses the dragon as part of its crest.\n\nThe emblem books popular from late medieval times through the 17th century often represent the dragon as an emblem of greed. The prevalence of dragons in European heraldry demonstrates that there is more to the dragon than greed.\n\nAgosti Xaho, a romantic myth creator of the 19th century, fused these myths in his own creation of \"Leherensuge\", the first and last serpent, that, in his newly coined legend, would arise again some time in the future bringing the rebirth of the Basque nation.\n\nDragons have long been portrayed in modern times as greedy treasure-hoarders, lusting for gold and precious gems. In such stories as \"Beowulf\", it is the theft of such treasure that sparks a dragon's fury. In the fantasy genre, however, there has been a trend of originally depicting dragons in a positive light: as allies instead of enemies, the red dragon of Wales, and the brother dragon of Poland. Dragons are increasingly viewed as friends of humans and as highly intelligent and noble creatures, while still remaining the fearsome beasts of legend. They are frequently shown as guardians and close friends of individual humans.\n\nMany of these modern ideas were first popularised by Anne McCaffrey with her \"Dragonriders of Pern\" series, with later authors such as Christopher Paolini also depicting sympathetic dragon characters in \"Eragon\". Ursula K. Le Guin created a meaningful image of dragons in her books about Earthsea. Ffyrnig, the Last Great Dragon of \"Legend of the Heart Eaters\", the first book in the story of \"Jonah and the Last Great Dragon\" by M.E.Holley is based on an actual legend of the Welsh Borders, which tells that the last great dragon is asleep under the Radnor Forest, imprisoned there by St. Michael. Bryan Davis' Dragons in our Midst depicts dragons as noble and kind beasts, having the ability to marry and reproduce with humans.\n\n"}

Rituals were carried on for the benefit of the dead, either by their relatives or by a class of priests appointed and paid to perform the rites. These rituals took place at the tombs of the dead themselves or at mortuary temples appointed to this purpose. Funerary cults are found in a wide variety of cultures.\n\nFunerary cults are especially associated with ancient Egypt, where it was common for royalty, those associated with royalty, cats, and the wealthy to be mummified. This practice was done so as to preserve their bodies for the journey to the afterlife. The deity Osiris, who was the dying and reviving god and Lord of the Egyptian afterlife, was usually depicted as a mummy in Egyptian art. Also at Bubastis, where Bast was worshiped, there was a massive cat cemetery. Cats were also thought to journey to the afterlife, usually to join their owners. These needed their own material goods for this journey, such as food.\n\nThe Roman Empire also had a funerary cult, revolving around Dionysus. Dionysus, (along with being lord of wine and parties) had been reborn many times and had rescued his mother Semele from the Underworld (the Roman afterlife, ruled by Hades). Each Roman God had his or her own clique of devotees, and it was thought that Dionysus could protect his initiates from death. He was also one of the Gods associated with plants (grapes in particular) and harvest. He was occasionally depicted in conjunction with other Gods (representatives of rebirth or plants of some kind) to indicate the dead also participated in the rejuvenation of the seasons.\n\nIn Sumer, Assyria, and Babylonia, funerary cults were called \"kispu.\" This funerary cult mostly revolved around caring for deceased kin, with a specific family member assigned to providing for a specific ghost. The ghosts were provided with food and other goods, however the provision of clean water was of particular importance. Both deceased men and women were supposed to receive this care. Without this care, the dead had the potential to become a malicious supernatural force. With this care, the dead family continue to participate in the lives of the living family. Also, the practice of recycling the names of the deceased allowed for familial continuity. In Assyria, this was done by any consanguineal kin. A Babylonian variation of this cult treats the veneration of the dead as an extension of the veneration for parents. Offspring were responsible for this care. Scholar Miranda Bayliss had stated the function of this cult was to alleviate guilt and other tensions from the death of the deceased and form solidarity and continuity within the family. Typically only close kin received this care. When ancestors beyond the individual's grandparents were venerated, it was done at large gatherings of extended kin groups. This also functioned to promote solidarity within the larger kin group.\n\nThe ancient Greek hero cult was also a funerary cult; in the original sense, a \"hero\" was a deified or semi-divine ancestor, worshiped at a shrine for his power to assist the living. The ancient Greek religion had three main aspect: the Gods, the heroes, and the dead. The dead are powerless and the Gods all-powerful, while the heroes are dead (live only in legend and memory) and are powerful. Heroes occupy a liminal space between the Gods and mortals. Mortals sacrificed livestock and plants at Heroes' tombs to intervene and commune with the Gods on their behalf.\n\nThe Samnites and Etruscans of the Italian peninsula, who painted the underworld deities Aita, Vanth, Phersipnei, and Letham on the walls of tombs.\n\n"}

Jenkins. Released on Tuesday, March 30, 2004, this book sees the surviving believers awaiting the return of Jesus Christ as the war of Armageddon and the seven-year Tribulation period draws to its climax. It was on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list for 22 weeks.\n\nThe Antichrist has assembled the armies of the world in the Valley of Megiddo for what he believes will be his ultimate triumph of the ages. With a victory here, he would ascend to the throne of God.\nThe Tribulation Force has migrated to the Middle East, most ensconced at Petra with the Jewish Remnant, now more than a million strong. Petra is surrounded by the Unity Army, poised to destroy all that is left of God's people and usher in Nicolae Carpathia's new world order.\n\nThe world holds its breath as the greatest military battle to ever take place threatens to obliterate all that remains of humanity. All seems lost. Tsion Ben-Judah and Buck Williams have been slain in Jerusalem, now overrun by Global Community forces. The hour of attack for Nicolae Carpathia’s Global Community Unity Army to assault the Rebels at the Temple Mount draws near. Mac McCullum goes to Jerusalem undercover to find Buck Williams and discovers his dead body before being ushered to a meeting with several more troops and Nicolae Carpathia's cabinet in Solomon's Stables. After witnessing Chaim Rosensweig preaching at Petra through live television and the death of a Global Community Officer, Satan temporarily leaves Carpathia's body and reminds the now trembling, feeble shell of Nicolae Carpathia that he is merely a shell for him before indwelling him once again.\n\nRayford is greatly wounded from a Global Community mortar attack on Petra's perimeter and is left on the brink of death before being discovered by Leah Rose and Abdullah and brought back to Petra in heavy bandages due to his injuries. As Mac returns and Chaim visits Rayford as night falls, the sun and moon go out before the stars and meteors fall upon the Global Community army, slightly reducing their numbers before the Sign of the Son of Man (a giant cross) appears and heals Rayford and all other saved and undecided of their injuries, causing many to become saved, including one third of the Jewish Remnant.\n\nThis does not dissuade the enemies of God, as the Unity Army, led by the Antichrist, Nicolae Carpathia himself, makes their final charge against Petra, seeking to annihilate all remaining rebels against the Global Community. But suddenly, as Nicolae begins leading the attack, the cross disappears from the sky as the Global Community's weaponry is rendered useless. Suddenly, the whole world is covered in a blinding light as the entire earth sees Jesus Christ coming in power and glory out of Heaven with the Armies and Raptured Saints of Heaven. As Jesus speaks, the entire third of the Global Community forces and Carpathia loyalists at Petra are slain with Nicolae and Leon fleeing to Bozrah. The Remnant at Petra are suddenly blessed with the ability to run at superhuman speeds, allowing them to arrive at Bozrah right before Jesus obliterates all the Global Community forces there and temporarily descends to the fields of Bozrah and stains his robe with blood, fulfilling the Prophecy of Isaiah 63:1-6 of Jesus trampling the enemies of God.\n\nWith Carpathia's forces gone in Bozrah, Nicolae and Leon board a helicopter to the Valley of Megiddo where the other two thirds of the Unity Army are stationed. As the Remnant passes the Valley to get to Jerusalem, Rayford, Abdullah and Mac drive to a ledge of the Valley of Megiddo and witness Jesus obliterating the remaining two thirds of the Unity Army which are not at Jerusalem or around the world with the Seventh Bowl judgement and a loud cry from God in Heaven shouting \"IT IS DONE!\" . Viv Ivins is killed by a large hailstone crushing her before Nicolae and Leon escape the rising swamp of blood and gore of the fallen Global Community troops and make for Jerusalem in a Humvee.\n\nAs Rayford, Mac, Abdullah and the rest of the Remnant arrive at Jerusalem, so does Nicolae and Leon, welcomed by Global Community loyalists. Nicolae mounts horseback, preparing to attack the Rebels at the Temple Mount before the horses are afflicted with a flesh-dissolving plague. Jesus appears in the sky again with the Armies of Heaven and Nicolae orders missiles shot at Jesus but to no avail. As the Global Community troops at Jerusalem die, Nicolae and Leon along with what's left of the Global Community forces arrive at the Mount of Olives as Jesus dismounts and descends onto the Mount of Olives, causing a great earthquake that splits the Mount of Olives in two. The last of the Global Community forces at Jerusalem die as Nicolae and Leon flee for safety. The Mount of Olives splitting also ushers in the largest Global Earthquake ever felt, completely flattening the world and causing Jerusalem to rise more than three hundred feet. The remaining Global Community forces and Carpathia loyalists bearing the Mark of the Beast are killed simultaneously by the Word of God and the Global Community is finally dissolved.\n\nJesus enters through the East Gate into Jerusalem and calls all the Christians to him where he comforts them. Michael, the archangel, captures Nicolae Carpathia, Leon Fortunato along with Ashtaroth, Baal, and Cankerworm. Jesus personally shames Ashtaroth, Baal, and Cankerworm before destroying them. Leon is driven to tears and attempts to renounce Nicolae and Satan before being sentenced to eternity in the Lake of Fire. Nicolae at first refuses to bow to Jesus until Jesus casts Satan out of him, causing Nicolae to revert to what he would look like if Satan had not caused him to come back to life three and a half years prior. The feeble, elderly and rotting remains of what was Nicolae Carpathia bows to Jesus before confessing that Jesus is Lord and the Son of God along with confessing that he wasted his entire life on personal gain in his quest for power. Jesus then opens a hole in the ground which leads directly to the Lake of Fire before Nicolae Carpathia and Leon Fortunato are thrown into it and enter into eternal torment.\n\nMichael then captures Satan and Jesus personally lays the charges on him, going back to the original rebellion in Heaven. Michael then chains Satan up and binds him before throwing him into the Bottomless Pit, where he will remain until the end of Jesus' 1,000-year reign. Jesus then departs for the Temple's throne as Believers find one another and find temporary lodging in houses and residential areas in Jerusalem.\n\nThe next day, Jesus gathers the entire remaining population of the earth in the Valley of Jehosaphat where the Sheep and Goats judgement occurs. Jesus banishes all those who still haven't accepted him as their saviour to Hell before resurrecting the dead Tribulation Saints and Old Testament saints before giving all of them their rewards. The Tribulation Saints along with the Raptured Church then re-unite with the surviving Tribulation Saints. Rayford is re-united with his wife Irene and son Raymie, and Kenny with Buck and Chloe, along with all the other saved characters who died throughout the series including Ken Ritz, Tsion Ben-Judah and his family, Hattie Durham, Floyd Charles, and others re-uniting in Glorified Bodies as the 75-day interval between the Glorious Appearing and the Millennial Kingdom begins.\n\nThe Recently Martyred\n\nIn the \"National Review\", the Catholic author Carl E. Olson described \"Glorious Appearing\" as \"400 pages of repetitive, numbing bombast\", and said that the premillennialist dispensationalist theology that forms the theological basis for the novels \"is rejected, either explicitly or implicitly, by the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox churches, and nearly every major Protestant denomination\". Olson also argues that the plot and details of the Left Behind series are similar to and possibly plagiarised from the Rapture novel \"666\" by Salem Kirban.\n"}
{"id": "2188010", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2188010", "title": "Goodbye, Farewell and Amen", "text": "Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\n\nGoodbye, Farewell and Amen is a television film that served as the 256th and final episode of the American television series \"M*A*S*H\". Closing out the series' 11th season, the 2 hour episode first aired on CBS on February 28, 1983, ending the series' original run. The episode was written by a large number of collaborators, including series star Alan Alda, who also directed. \n\nThe episode's plot chronicles the final days of the Korean War at the 4077th MASH, and features several storylines intended to show the war's effects on the individual personnel of the unit, and to bring closure to the series. After the ceasefire goes into effect, the members of the 4077th throw a party before taking down the camp for the last time. After tear-filled goodbyes, the main characters go their separate ways, leading to the final scene of the series.\n\nAs peace negotiations continue during the Korean War, Hawkeye Pierce is being treated by Dr. Sidney Freedman at a mental hospital. Sidney is trying to get Hawkeye to release repressed memories of an outing most of the 4077th staff attended at a beach near Incheon which appears to have led to a nervous breakdown. Hawkeye first remembers the trip home as having a party-like atmosphere with him calling for a bottle of whiskey to be passed to a person who \"can't wait\" to drink it. He next recalls that the person in question was actually a soldier who needed the bottle. Eventually he remembers that the bottle did not contain whiskey, but plasma, and the soldier was severely wounded. Hawkeye was actually yelling impatiently that \"this guy can't wait\".\n\nFurther on, Hawkeye recalls that they picked up some refugees and wounded soldiers further up the road as an enemy patrol was coming. The bus had to hide off the road and the occupants were forced to remain quiet. Before Hawkeye tells more, he lashes out at two of his fellow patients for getting into a loud argument. Hawkeye says they were screaming like chickens, and jokes about chickens taking the bus. Using that as a clue, Sidney digs deeper and Hawkeye remembers a refugee woman who was carrying a chicken that would not stop clucking.\n\nHawkeye insists that he is perfectly fine, but Freedman reminds him that after returning to the 4077th, Hawkeye had accused an anesthesiologist of trying to smother a patient, and then drove a Jeep through a wall in the officers' club and ordered a double bourbon. After more questioning, Hawkeye remembers telling the refugee to make the chicken be quiet, and then that the woman had killed the chicken to silence it. Hawkeye then breaks down sobbing as he remembers that the refugee woman was not carrying a chicken, but her infant child, and had smothered her baby to death to silence it as Hawkeye had insisted. Hawkeye is initially angry at Sidney for making him remember, but Sidney tells him, \"You had to get it out in the open. Now we're halfway home.\" Hawkeye initially believes he will be sent home to Maine, but after more sessions, Sidney informs him he must go back to the 4077th and promises to check in on him.\n\nBack at the 4077th, the camp is helping to shelter some of the North Korean and Chinese troops surrendering in the final days of the war. Charles Winchester, who is suffering from diarrhea, possibly dysentery, encounters a group of Chinese soldiers on a motorcycle when he is forced to relieve himself in a local creek after the camp's latrine is destroyed by a runaway tank. The soldiers surrender to him and reveal themselves to be musicians. Winchester brings the soldiers back to camp along with the motorcycle, which B.J. Hunnicutt decides to take for himself and paint yellow. As Winchester is trying to listen to music (Mozart, Clarinet Quintet in A, K. 581), the Chinese musicians annoy him with their own playing. When Winchester tells them to stop, they recognize the name Mozart and one of the musicians begins playing the same piece to which Winchester was listening. An impressed Winchester decides to teach them how to play it properly, eventually forming a bond with the Chinese POWs.\n\nWinchester is also distressed over the future of his career after the end of the war. He tells Margaret Houlihan that he has applied to be chief of thoracic surgery at Mercy Hospital in Boston, which he regards as \"the finest in New England\", but has been notified by a friend that another, less surgically qualified, but more politically connected surgeon might get the position, instead. Margaret decides to assist Winchester in his application, as a friend of her father's is the chief of staff at Mercy Hospital. Winchester receives a letter days later that tells him the good news. However, he is told by Klinger that Margaret assisted him, and angry that he did not get it through his own efforts, storms off, and is curt and rude to Houlihan.\n\nKlinger has fallen in love with Soon-Lee Han, a local Korean refugee at the camp. Soon-Lee has been searching for her parents, who have gone missing, and has been told they are in Chorwon nearby. Chorwon, however, is the site of ongoing fighting and Klinger does not want Soon-Lee going there. Eventually, he finds out that she has left and chases after her, hoping that she will come back. After she initially refuses, he declares his feelings for her and takes her back to camp.\n\nB.J. Hunnicutt has received discharge papers and is excited about going home to finally see his daughter, Erin, whom he has not seen since she was born. Col. Potter is initially unhappy about being without two of his surgeons as Hawkeye has not yet left the mental hospital. However, the colonel agrees after B.J. tells him that he knows of a surgeon who will take his place.\n\nAlmost immediately thereafter, the camp is attacked with mortars. Several POWs, locked in a makeshift pen in the compound, are stuck in the line of fire and Father Mulcahy goes to let them out. A mortar explodes directly in front of him and knocks him out. B.J. examines Mulcahy and finds that he is suffering from tinnitus and could potentially lose his hearing. Mulcahy, knowing that deafness could result in him being discharged, demands B.J. keep it a secret from the camp, as he does not want to abandon the local orphans for whom he has been caring.\n\nThe mortar attacks continue and Potter, believing it is because of the abandoned tank that destroyed the latrine and remains in the compound, calls I Corps headquarters, demanding answers. He is told that the tank has to stay at the 4077th until the unit to which it belonged comes back and claims it. Klinger decides to help by draping a tent over the tank so the North Koreans will not see it, but it proves only to be a temporary fix, as the enemy knows the tank is still there and continues to attack.\n\nAs B.J. is leaving the camp by helicopter, Klinger opens that day's mail and informs Potter that B.J.'s discharge was rescinded. Potter decides to ignore this, telling Klinger to put any mail on his desk and that he will look at it later. Hawkeye returns shortly thereafter to find a new batch of wounded in the camp and that his roommate and best friend has gone home. Potter calls headquarters while operating and asks where the new surgeon is. The mortar attacks on the 4077th resume worse than before. As everyone is pinned down in the operating room (OR), Hawkeye decides to run out to move the tank. He turns it around, before hitting the OR tent, smashing through the newly built latrine, and finally running the tank into the camp garbage dump, deflecting the shelling away from the hospital. Potter is not amused by this and decides that Hawkeye needs to see Sidney again.\n\nThat night, an incendiary bomb attack sparks a fire in the nearby forest and the 4077th is in its path, forcing the camp to evacuate and move operations (\"bug out\"). Once the new camp is set up, Potter's replacement surgeon arrives. To his surprise, it is B.J., who tells Potter that he got about \"a third of the way home\" before word of his recall to the 4077th got to him in Guam. He apologizes to Hawkeye for not leaving him a note, as he was so rushed the day he left, but Hawkeye brushes it off.\n\nSidney arrives at the new camp site in the middle of a celebration, as the 4077th decides to throw a party in absentia for B.J.'s daughter, who is turning two. A two-year-old orphan girl is picked to take the place of Erin Hunnicutt and B.J. is touched. Hawkeye, however, is saddened and walks off. Sidney follows him, telling him that his tank stunt was the most sensible thing to do, that he should not be afraid of his job anymore, that he is overthinking things, and that his failures might make him a better doctor.\n\nA POW exchange takes place later that day, which includes the five Chinese musicians. Winchester tries to keep them with him, but is turned away by a soldier. As the truck taking them leaves, the musicians bid farewell to Winchester by playing the Mozart piece correctly. Moments later, an announcement is relayed to the camp: a ceasefire has been agreed to and, at 10:00 that evening, the United States' involvement in the Korean War will come to an end. Almost on cue, a new batch of wounded arrives at the camp. Potter informs the doctors that this is to be the last set of wounded operated on at the new camp, as headquarters has ordered them back to their original site at Uijeongbu.\n\nOnce they return, a new batch of wounded arrives at the compound on top of the one they were working on and Winchester is dispatched to perform triage outside. He discovers that one of the deceased patients is one of the Chinese musicians. Winchester also learns that everyone else in the truck carrying the POWs was killed in an attack. Winchester, still in disbelief, returns to the Swamp and listens to his Mozart record, but after a few seconds, he pulls it out of the player and smashes it to bits in anger.\n\nAs he is finished operating, Hawkeye's next patient is a young girl who was apparently wounded in a round of shelling. With Sidney observing, Hawkeye hesitates in performing the operation. Although Potter offers to switch with him, Hawkeye decides to operate on the little girl himself. With Hawkeye now apparently back to normal, Sidney decides to depart the 4077th for the last time and Hawkeye thanks him for his treatment. As Sidney leaves, he echoes a statement he made to the doctors in one of his first visits years earlier: \"Ladies and gentlemen, take my advice. Pull down your pants and slide on the ice.\" Once Sidney is out of the OR, the announcement of the ceasefire and the end of the shelling comes over the radio. The doctors pause in wonder at the new peace, then continue operating on the remaining wounded.\n\nThe camp spends its last night together at a party in the mess tent. Colonel Potter decides to have everyone talk about what they will be doing after the war. Potter is heading home to his wife Mildred in Hannibal, Missouri, where he will still practice medicine part-time. Hawkeye says that he originally wanted to work in a city hospital, but instead everything that has happened to him has changed his mind and that he plans to open a practice in his hometown of Crabapple Cove, Maine. B.J. jokes that he has run off with somebody at the airport bar in Guam, but is really headed back to San Francisco to be reunited with his family. Winchester tells the camp of his new position at Mercy Hospital, but because of the deaths of the Chinese musicians he helped teach, the music that he loved and sought out as a refuge is to remain a reminder of the horrors of war. Margaret was offered two positions abroad through her father's influence, but has decided to refuse them and take a job in America working in a hospital. Mulcahy has decided to begin working with the deaf and hard-of-hearing, having been inspired by his accident. Klinger surprises everyone by announcing that, after years of trying to receive a section-eight discharge and go home, he is staying in Korea to marry Soon-Lee, who will not leave the country until she finds her parents.\n\nThe next morning, Father Mulcahy presides over Klinger and Soon-Lee's wedding with Potter as the best man and Margaret as the matron of honor. After the wedding, the camp starts to be disassembled and various members remove their hometown signs from the camp signpost. Father Mulcahy leaves for the 8063rd, with B.J. continuing to protect the secret of Mulcahy's hearing loss until the time he leaves. Winchester and Margaret are to leave in the same jeep, but Winchester cannot get on because it is overloaded with Margaret's belongings. Margaret, still upset at Winchester for his ingratitude, decides to disembark, but Winchester tells her to stay and orders Sgt. Rizzo to find him another ride. Winchester makes peace with Margaret and allows her to keep one of his treasured poetry books. She then says goodbye to B.J., Potter, and Hawkeye, who gives her a long, passionate kiss.\n\nAfter Margaret leaves, the Swamp is struck down as its occupants sarcastically mock its demise. Winchester leaves in a garbage truck, the last vehicle Rizzo has, but not before telling Potter that he hopes to guide his charges in the way Potter guided him and the rest of the camp. He then bids farewell to his tentmates, telling Hawkeye and B.J. that they showed him \"what going home is all about\". Winchester then boards the garbage truck, commenting, \"what better way to leave a garbage dump\", and leaves.\n\nThe next to leave is the colonel, who rides out of camp one last time on his beloved horse Sophie. Once he reaches the 8063rd, he boards a waiting jeep to head towards his flight home, and donates Sophie to the orphanage for the children. Before he goes, he tells B.J. and Hawkeye that he was glad that they all worked together and that he will miss the good laughs they all shared, appreciating them because Hawkeye and B.J. always managed to give him joy when he needed it the most. After Potter climbs onto Sophie, Hawkeye and B.J. offer Potter a salute in appreciation of him. The colonel rides off into the distance, leaving the two Swampmates as the last people at the camp.\n\nA chopper then arrives at the helipad to take Hawkeye to his next stop. B.J. offers him a ride on the motorcycle he claimed from the Chinese musicians and takes him up the hill to the helipad. While there, Hawkeye and B.J. have one final conversation. Hawkeye says that he will never be able to \"shake\" B.J., and the two tell each other that things at home will remind them of each other. The two embrace and say they will miss each other, and Hawkeye boards the chopper.\n\nEarlier, Hawkeye had been irritated with B.J. for his apparent inability to say \"goodbye\" as the two would probably never see each other again. Just before B.J. rides off for the last time, he says to Hawkeye that though he will try to find him once they get back to the states, he left Hawkeye a note just in case. The chopper takes off and as it gains altitude, Hawkeye sees that B.J. has arranged a large number of stones to read \"GOODBYE\" on the helipad. Upon seeing that, he smiles, knowing that B.J. was capable of saying goodbye after all, and the chopper flies away from what is left of the 4077th for the last time. The original theme song \"Suicide Is Painless\" (from the 1970 film) is then played in its entirety.\n\nThe anticipation before the airing of \"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\" was almost unprecedented, especially for a regular television series (in contrast to awards shows, sporting events, or special events). Interest from advertisers prompted CBS, the network broadcasting \"M*A*S*H\", to sell 30-second commercial blocks for $450,000 (equal to $ today) each—costlier than even for NBC's airing of the Super Bowl of that year.\n\nOn the night the episode aired, large areas of California (particularly the San Francisco Bay Area) suffered power outages due to unusually stormy winter weather, which prevented many viewers from watching the series finale. Three weeks later, on March 21, KPIX, the CBS affiliate in San Francisco, reaired the episode.\n\nIn the United States, the episode drew 105.97 million total viewers and a total audience of 121.6 million, more than both Super Bowl XVII and the \"Roots\" miniseries. The episode surpassed the single-episode ratings record that had been set by the \"Dallas\" episode that resolved the \"Who Shot J.R.?\" cliffhanger. From 1983 until 2010, \"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\" remained the most watched television broadcast in American history, passed only in total viewership (but not in ratings or share) in February 2010 by Super Bowl XLIV. It still stands as the most-watched finale of any television series, as well as the most-watched episode.\n\nAs \"M*A*S*H\" was one of the most successful shows in TV history, in order not to completely lose the franchise, CBS quickly created a new series, \"AfterMASH\", that followed the postwar adventures of Colonel Potter, Max Klinger, and Father Mulcahy in a stateside hospital. Despite wide popularity in its premiere episodes, script problems and constant character changes led to a sharp decline in viewers, and the show was cancelled by CBS after only two seasons. Another would be spin-off, \"W*A*L*T*E*R\", was a pilot made in 1984 that was never picked up. It starred Gary Burghoff, who reprised his \"M*A*S*H\" character.\n\n\"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\" was not initially included in the syndication package for \"M*A*S*H\"'s final season. However, in 1992, the episode made its syndication premiere in time for its 10th anniversary. Local stations aired it as a part of a \"Movie of the Week\".\n\nWhen \"M*A*S*H\" was shown on FX and Hallmark Channel, they aired \"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\" occasionally. Hallmark Channel showed it twice a year, February and August, before dropping \"M*A*S*H\" from its schedule. TV Land and MeTV have also shown the episode sporadically, including a Veterans Day broadcast on November 11, 2015. In Canada, the cable channel History Television shows the episode in its entirety annually on the Labor Day holiday.\n\nIn 2011, the TV Guide Network special \"TV's Most Unforgettable Finales\" ranked this finale as the best.\n\n"}

The additional meaning, to interrupt speakers with awkward or embarrassing questions, was added in Scotland, and specifically perhaps in early nineteenth century Dundee, a famously radical town where the hecklers who combed the flax had established a reputation as the most radical and belligerent element in the workforce. In the heckling factory, one heckler would read out the day's news while the others worked, to the accompaniment of interruptions and furious debate.\n\nHeckling was a major part of the vaudeville theater. Sometimes it was incorporated into the play. Milton Berle's weekly TV variety series in the 1960s featured a heckler named Sidney Spritzer (German/Yiddish for 'squirter') played by Borscht Belt comic Irving Benson. In the 1970s and 1980s, \"The Muppet Show\", which was also built around a vaudeville theme, featured two hecklers, Statler & Waldorf (two old men named after famous hotels). Heckles are now particularly likely to be heard at comedy performances, to unsettle or compete with the performer.\n\nPoliticians speaking before live audiences have less latitude to deal with hecklers. Legally, such conduct may constitute protected free speech. Strategically, coarse or belittling retorts to hecklers entail personal risk disproportionate to any gain. Some politicians, however, have been known to improvise a relevant and witty response despite these pitfalls. One acknowledged expert at this was Harold Wilson, British Prime Minister in the 1960s:\n\nMartin Luther King's I Have a Dream speech was largely a response to supporter Mahalia Jackson interrupting his prepared speech to shout \"Tell them about the dream, Martin\". At that point, King stopped reading from his previously prepared speech and improvised the remainder of the speech - this improvised portion of the speech is the best-known part of the speech and frequently rated as one of the best of all time.\n\nDuring a campaign stop just before winning the Presidency in 1980, Ronald Reagan was heckled by an audience member who kept interrupting him during a speech. Reagan tried to go on with his speech three times, but after being interrupted yet again glared at the heckler and snapped \"Aw, shut up!\" The audience immediately gave him a standing ovation.\n\nIn 1992, then-Presidential candidate Bill Clinton was interrupted by Bob Rafsky, a member of the AIDS activism group ACT UP, who accused him of \"dying of ambition to be president\" during a rally. After becoming visibly agitated, Clinton took the microphone off the stand, pointed to the heckler and directly responded to him by saying, \"[...] I have treated you and all of the other people who have interrupted my rallies with a hell of a lot more respect than you treated me. And it's time to start thinking about that!\" Clinton was then met with raucous applause.\n\nOne modern political approach to discourage heckling is to ensure that major events are given before a \"tame\" audience of sympathizers, or conducted to allow restrictions on who may remain on the premises (see also, \"astroturfing\"). The downside is this may make heckling incidents even more newsworthy. This happened to Tony Blair during a photo op visit to a hospital during the 2001 general election campaign, and again in 2003 during a speech.\n\nIn 2004, American Vice President Dick Cheney was interrupted mid-speech by Perry Patterson, a middle-aged mother in a pre-screened rally audience. After various supportive outbursts that were permitted (\"Four more years\", \"Go Bush!\"), Patterson uttered \"No, no, no, no\" and was removed from the speech area and told to leave. She refused, and was arrested for criminal trespass.\n\nLater, in 2005, Cheney received some heckling that was broadcast during his trip to New Orleans, after Hurricane Katrina ravaged the area. The heckling occurred during a press conference in Gulfport, Mississippi, in an area that was cordoned off for public safety reasons, and then further secured for the press conference. Nevertheless, emergency room physician Ben Marble got close enough to the proceedings and could be heard yelling, \"Go fuck yourself, Mr. Cheney.\" Cheney laughed it off and continued speaking. The heckle was a reference to Cheney's use of the phrase the previous year, when during a heated exchange with Senator Patrick Joseph Leahy, Vermont, he said \"fuck yourself\" on the floor of the senate.\n\nOn 15 October 2005, \"The Scotsman\" reported \"Iranian ambassador Dr Seyed Mohammed Hossein Adeli... speaking at the annual Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament conference... During his speech to the CND several people were told to leave the room following protests at Iran's human rights record. Several protesters shouted \"Fascists\" at the ambassador and the organisers of the conference. Walter Wolfgang, the 82-year-old peace campaigner who was forced out of the Labour Party conference last month, was in the audience.\"\n\nSince 2005 heckling of performing artists has become more commonplace in Switzerland. Musicians of Basel and Zurich have become an increasing focus of hecklers. This shift is primarily perpetrated by foreigners and is often met with a positive response by the non-Swiss performers who welcome the audience interaction. \n\nOn Thursday, 20 April 2006, a heckler from the Falun Gong spiritual movement entered the US White House grounds as a reporter and interrupted a formal arrival ceremony for Chinese President Hu Jintao. Moments into Mr Hu's speech at the event, Wang Wenyi, perched on the top tier of the stands reserved for the press, began screaming in English and Chinese: \"President Bush stop him. Stop this visit. Stop the killing and torture.\" President Bush later apologised to his guest.\n\nOn 9 September 2009, Representative Joe Wilson (R-SC) shouted \"You lie!\" at President Barack Obama after President Obama stated that his health care plan would not subsidize coverage for illegal immigrants during a speech he was making to a joint session of Congress. Wilson later apologized for his outburst.\n\nOn 25 November 2013, Ju Hong, a 24-year-old South Korean immigrant without legal documentation, shouted at Obama to use his executive power to stop deportation of illegal immigrants. Obama said \"If, in fact, I could solve all these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so.\" \"But we're also a nation of laws, that's part of our tradition,\" he continued. \"And so the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws. And what I'm proposing is the harder path, which is to use our democratic processes to achieve the same goal.\"\n\nHecklers can also appear at sporting events, and usually (but not always) direct their taunts at a visiting team. Fans of the Philadelphia Eagles American football team are notorious for heckling; among the most infamous incidents were booing and subsequently throwing snowballs at a performer dressed as Santa Claus in a halftime show in 1968, and cheering at the career-ending injury of visiting team player Michael Irvin in 1999. Often, sports heckling will also involve throwing objects onto the field; this has led most sports stadiums to ban glass containers and bottlecaps. Another famous heckler is Robert Szasz, who regularly attends Tampa Bay Rays baseball games and is known for loudly heckling one opposing player per game or series. Former Yugoslav football star Dejan Savićević is involved in an infamous incident with a heckler in which during an interview, a man on the street is heard shouting off-camera: \"You're a piece of shit!\" Dejan berated the man, and went on to finish the interview, without missing a beat.\n\nIn English and Scottish football, heckling and swearing from the stands, and football chants such as who ate all the pies? are common.\n\nAustralian sporting audiences are known for creative heckling. Perhaps the most famous is Yabba who had a grandstand at the Sydney Cricket Ground named after him, and now a statue.\n\nThe sport of cricket is particularly notorious for heckling between the teams themselves, which is known as sledging.\n\nAt the NBA Drafts of recent years, many fans have gone with heckling ESPN NBA analyst and host of, Quite Frankly with Stephen A. Smith, Stephen A. Smith. Most notably, The Stephen A. Smith Heckling Society of Gentlemen heckles him with a sock puppet dubbed as Stephen A. himself.\n\nTennis fans are also fairly noted for heckling. Some may call out during a service point to distract either player. Another common heckle from tennis fans is cheering after a service fault, which is considered to be rude and unsporting.\n\nIn 2009, then Toronto Blue Jays outfielder Alex Ríos was a victim of a heckling incident outside after a fund-raising event. The incident occurred after Rios declined to sign an autograph for a young fan, the same day he went 0 for 5 with 5 strikeouts in a game against the Los Angeles Angels. An older man yelled \"The way you played today Alex, you should be lucky someone wants your autograph.\" Rios then replied with \"Who gives a fuck\", repeating it until being ushered into a vehicle. Rios did apologize the next day, but was eventually placed on waivers and claimed by the Chicago White Sox later that year.\n\nOne of the most famous heckles in music history occurred at a Bob Dylan concert at the Manchester Free Trade Hall in 1966. During a quiet moment in between songs, an audience member shouts very loudly and clearly, \"Judas!\" referencing Dylan's so-called betrayal of folk music by \"going electric\". Dylan replied: \"I don't believe you, you're a liar!\" before telling his band to \"Play it fucking loud!\" They play an acidic version of \"Like a Rolling Stone\". This incident was captured on tape and the full concert was released as volume four of Dylan's \"Live Bootleg Series\".\n\nHeckling often occurs during stand up comedy performances, particularly at open stage performances, and/or where alcoholic beverages are being consumed. It is regarded as a sign of audience members becoming impatient with what they regard as a low quality performance. Some comedians ignore the heckling and dislike the practice. In an interview for a 2011 BBC documentary, Billy Connolly said that \"I loathe hecklers. I haven't one good syllable to say about hecklers. When you've come out of the club circuit and all that and you're in the concert hall...they should be gone.\" Other stand-up comedians devise a strategy for quashing such outbursts, usually by having a store of retorts (known as \"squelches\") on hand. The idea is to get the audience laughing at the heckler for being outwitted.\n\nIn addition, live comedy venues tend to discourage heckling via signage and admissions policy, but tend to tolerate it as it creates customer loyalty. The etiquette of exactly how much heckling is tolerated differs immensely from venue to venue, however, but is generally more likely to be tolerated in blue collar or working class venues. Some cities feature 'heckle nights' where heckling is actively encouraged.\n\nThe comedy TV series \"The Muppet Show\" featured a pair of hecklers named Statler and Waldorf. These characters created a kind of meta-comedy act in which the show's official comedian, Fozzie Bear, acted as their usual foil, although they occasionally made jokes at other characters as well.\n\nAnother notable use of heckling in comedy is in the cult favorite series \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\". The series involves a man (either Joel Robinson or Mike Nelson) and two robots (Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot) sitting in a theater mocking bad B-movies. This style of comedy, coined as riffing, is continued with commentary-based series such as Rifftrax and Cinematic Titanic.\n\nIn one of Rowan Atkinson's plays \"The School Master\", a heckler interrupted his play by shouting \"Here!\" after Atkinson had read out an amusing name on his register. Atkinson incorporated it into his act by saying \"I have a detention book...\"\n\n"}

{"id": "12094804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12094804", "title": "Hispanophobia", "text": "Hispanophobia\n\nAnti-Spanish sentiment or Hispanophobia (from Latin \"Hispanus\", \"Spaniard\" and Greek φοβία (\"phobia\"), \"fear\") is a fear, distrust, aversion, hatred, or discrimination against Hispanic people, Hispanic culture and the Spanish language. Its opposite is Hispanophilia. This historical phenomenon has had three main stages, originating in 16th-century Europe, reawakening during 19th-century disputes over Spanish and Mexican territory such as the Spanish–American and Mexican–American Wars, and finally in tandem with politically charged controversies such as bilingual education and illegal immigration to the United States. Within the complex identity politics of Spain, Catalan, Basque, Galician nationalism has also been identified with hispanophobic views and discourse.\n\nEarly instances of Hispanophobia arose as the influence of the Spanish Empire and Inquisition spread through late-medieval Europe. During this period Hispanophobia materialized in folklore sometimes referred to as the Black Legend:\n\n\"La leyenda negra\", as Spanish historians first named it, entailed a view of Spaniards as \"unusually cruel, avaricious, treacherous, fanatical, superstitious, hot-blooded, corrupt, decadent, indolent, and authoritarian\". As Spain and England colonized the Americas, \"[t]he Black Legend informed Anglo Americans' judgments about the political, economic, religious, and social forces that had shaped the Spanish provinces from Florida to California, as well as throughout the hemisphere\". These judgments were handed down from Europeans who saw the Spaniards as inferior to other European cultures.\n\nThus in North America, Hispanophobia preceded the United States' Declaration of Independence by almost two hundred years. Historians theorize that the English and the Dutch employed and encouraged it as part of their efforts to undermine the Spanish Empire; early New Englanders engaged in Hispanophobic efforts to assimilate Spanish colonies:\nDuring the early 20th century, Anglo-Americans in the United States used eugenics as a basis for their hispanophobia. With the help of the eugenics, C.M. Goethe aided with the transfer of hispanophobia to politics. \"Another circumstance,\" according to historian David J. Weber, \"that shaped the depth of Anglo Americans' hispanophobia was the degree to which they saw Hispanics as an obstacle to their ambitions\". As the U.S. grew into a republic, anti-Spanish sentiment exhibited a recrudescence. Spain was perceived as the antithesis of separation of church and state and as a paragon of monarchy and colonialism; this apparently fundamental opposition to the United States' founding principles fueled hostility that would eventually culminate in the Spanish–American War of 1898. Hispanophobia is particularly evident in the historiography of the Texas Revolution:\nThroughout the 20th century, an array of mostly political and economic forces have driven immigration from a multitude of Spanish-speaking countries—such as Cuba, Guatemala, Dominican Republic, and Mexico—to the relatively strong economy and stable political environment of the United States. As a result, according to some historians, Americans \"now have something called a 'Hispanic,' which describes not someone born in a Spanish-speaking country, nor someone who speaks Spanish well or badly, nor even someone with a Hispanic surname, but someone who identifies himself as such\". As key corollary to this development, it is toward this group, which is not precisely or rigorously defined, that U.S. hispanophobia is now predominantly oriented. Many forms of hispanophobia endemic to the Texas Revolution still flourish in the United States today.\n\nSociologists cite the \"Official English\" or English-only movement, together with hispanophobic jokes and discourse, as a prominent example of modern-day hispanophobia.\nThe \"Official English movement\" has been criticized because its mass appeal is not as relating to any measurable benefit that would result from the eradication of bilingual education and other bilingual services. Rather, its appeal results from the fact that \"challenges to the status of one's language typically engage deep-seated feelings about national identity and group worth\". Proponents of this view point out that the English-only movement attracts public support primarily by functioning as a hispanophobic form of intimidation.\n\nCiting groups such as the Minuteman Project, sociologists have concluded that some anti-illegal-immigration arguments in the United States have been tainted with xenophobia and hispanophobia, many of them drawing on concepts of racial purity and eugenics. These groups' concern with illegal immigration, they assert, \"lies not in immigration per se., which has declined in the last decade, but in the changing national origin of new immigrants, that is immigrants are now mainly Latin American or Asian, which is seen as a threat to the Anglo-Saxon tradition\".\n\nIn 2006, Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard and U.S. Attorney Paul Charlton sent a letter of complaint to Federal Communications Commission chairman Kevin Martin, in response to the following comments made by radio host Brian James:\n\nCalling the speech \"dangerous and totally irresponsible for anyone, particularly a licensed body using public airways\", Goddard and Charlton expressed concern that it would lead to violence in the state, where conflict over illegal immigration was growing increasingly heated. The radio host said the remarks were \"satirical\"; the radio station, KFYI, indicated that James was trying out for a regular position on the station and was not an employee.\n\nNew Jersey internet radio host, white supremacist, and convicted felon Hal Turner who used to broadcast out of his house made similar remarks, a number of which the Anti-Defamation League has posted under the category of extremism. On April 1, 2006, Turner said:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2407884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2407884", "title": "Human–animal communication", "text": "Human–animal communication\n\nHuman–animal communication is the communication observed between humans and other animals, from non-verbal cues and vocalizations through to the use of language.\n\nHuman–animal communication may be observed in everyday life. The interactions between pets and their owners, for example, reflect a form of spoken, while not necessarily verbal dialogue. A dog being scolded is able to grasp the message by interpreting cues such as the owner's stance, tone of voice, and body language. This communication is two-way, as owners can learn to discern the subtle differences between barks and meows, and there is a clear difference between the bark of an angry dog defending its home and the happy bark of the same animal while playing. Communication (often nonverbal) is also significant in equestrian activities such as dressage.\n\nOne scientific study has found that 30 bird species and 29 mammal species share the same pattern of pitch and speed in basic messages, so humans and those 59 species can understand each other when they express \"aggression, hostility, appeasement, approachability, submission and fear.\n\nParrots are able to use words meaningfully in linguistic tasks. In particular, the grey parrot Alex learned 100 words, and after training used English words to answer questions about color, shapes, size and numbers correctly about 80% of the time.\nHe also, without training, said where he wanted to be taken, such as his cage or the back of a chair, and protested when taken elsewhere, or when hidden objects were not where he thought they were.\nHe asked a question, what color he himself was, which has been called the only question so far asked by a non-human animal.\n\"Scientific American\" editor Madhusree Mukerjee described these abilities as creativity and reasoning comparable to nonhuman primates or cetaceans, while expressing concern that extensive language use resulted in feather-plucking behavior, a possible sign of stress.\n\nMost bird species have at least six calls which humans can learn to understand, for situations including danger, distress, hunger, and the presence of food.\n\nPigeons can identify different artists. Pigeons can learn to recognize up to 58 four-letter English words, with an average of 43, though they were not taught any meanings to associate with the words.\n\nJava Sparrows chose music by sitting on a particular perch, which determined which music was played. Two birds preferred Bach and Vivaldi over Schoenberg or silence. The other two birds had varying preferences among Bach, Schoenberg, white noise and silence.\n\nThe greater honeyguide has a specific call to alert humans that it can lead them to honey, and also responds to a specific human call requesting such a lead, by leading humans to honeybee hives so it can eat the discarded honeycomb wax after humans collect the honey. The human call varies regionally, so the honeyguide's response is learned in each area, not instincive.\n\nCrows identify and respond differently to different human faces.\n\nFictional portrayals of sentient talking parrots and similar birds are common in children's fiction, such as the talking, loud-mouth parrot Iago of Disney's \"Aladdin\".\n\nChimpanzees can make at least 32 sounds with distinct meanings for humans.\n\nChimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans have used sign language, physical tokens, keyboards and touch screens to communicate with humans in numerous research studies. The research showed that they understood multiple signals and produced them to communicate with humans. There is some disagreement whether they can re-order them to create distinct meanings.\n\nBaboons can learn to recognize an average of 139 4-letter English words (maximum of 308), though they were not taught any meanings to associate with the words.\n\nPrimates also have been trained to use touch screens to tell a researcher their musical preferences. In Toronto, for hundreds of songs in random order, orangutans were given one 30-second segment of a song, and then chose between repeating that segment or 30 seconds of silence. Different orangutans chose to replay from 8% to 48% of the segments, and all exhibited stress throughout the trials. There was no pattern of selections by genre, and the researchers did not look for other attributes which were shared by the orangutans' chosen segments. No comparison was available of how many 30-second segments humans would repeat in the same situation. In another experiment the orangutans did not distinguish between music played in its original order and music sliced into half-second intervals which were played in random order. Chimpanzees can hear higher frequencies than humans; if orangutans can too, and if these overtones are present in the recordings, the overtones would affect their choices.\n\nIn the 1960s, John C. Lilly sponsored English lessons for one bottlenose dolphin (\"Tursiops truncatus\"). The teacher, Margaret Howe Lovatt, lived with the dolphin for months in a house on the shore of the Virgin Islands. The house was partially flooded and allowed them to be together for meals, play, language lessons, and sleep. Lilly thought of this as a mother-child dyad, though the dolphin was 5–6 years old. Lilly said that he had heard other dolphins repeating his own English words, and believed that an intelligent animal would want to mimic the language of its captors, to communicate. The experiment ended in the third month and did not restart, because Howe found the two-room lab and constant bumping from the dolphin too constricting.\n\nAfter several weeks, a concerted effort by the dolphin to imitate the instructor's speech was evident, and human-like sounds were apparent, and recorded. It was able to perform tasks such as retrieval of aurally indicated objects without fail. Later in the project the dolphin's ability to process linguistic syntax was made apparent, in that it could distinguish between commands such as \"Bring the ball to the doll,\" and \"Bring the doll to the ball.\" This ability not only demonstrates the bottlenose dolphin's grasp of basic grammar, but also implies the dolphins' own language might include syntactical rules. The correlation between length and 'syllables' (bursts of the dolphin's sound) with the instructor's speech also went from essentially zero at the beginning of the session to almost a perfect correlation by its completion, so that when the human spoke 5 or 10 syllables, the dolphin also spoke 5 or 10 'syllables' or bursts of sound.\n\nTwo experiments of this sort are explained in detail in Lilly's book, \"Mind of the Dolphin\". The first experiment was more of a test run to check psychological and other strains on the human and cetacean participants, determining the extent of the need for other human contact, dry clothing, time alone, and so on. Despite tensions after several weeks, Howe Lovatt agreed to the months isolated with the dolphin.\n\nExperiments by the research team of Louis Herman, a former collaborator and student of Lilly's, demonstrated that dolphins could understand human communication in whistles and respond with the same whistles.\n\nA female bottlenose dolphin, Phoenix, understood at least 34 whistles\nWhistles created a system of 2-way communication. By having separate whistles for object and action, Herman could reorder commands without fresh teaching (take hoop to ball). Successful communication was shown when Herman used new combinations, and the dolphin understood and did what he asked without further training 80-90% of the time.\n\nIn 1980, Herman had taught 6 whistles to a female bottle-nose dolphin, Kea, to refer to three objects and three actions, and the dolphin followed his instructions. He wrote, \"In addition to mouthing the three familiar training objects in the presence of the mouth name, Kea correctly mouthed on their first appearance a plastic water pipe, a wooden disc, and the experimenter's open hand. The same type of immediate response generalization occurred for touch and fetch.\"\n\nRichards, Wolz and Herman (1984) trained a dolphin to make distinct whistles for objects, \"so that, in effect, the dolphin gave unique vocal labels to those objects.\"\n\nHerman's later publications do not discuss the whistle communication. Herman started getting US Navy funding in 1985, so further expansion of the 2-way whistle language would have been in the classified United States Navy Marine Mammal Program, a black project.\n\nHerman also studied the crossmodal perceptual ability of dolphins. Dolphins typically perceive their environment through sound waves generated in the melon of their skulls, through a process known as echolocation (similar to that seen in bats, though the mechanism of production is different). The dolphin's eyesight however is also fairly good, even by human standards, and Herman's research found that any object, even of complex and arbitrary shape, identified either by sight or sound by the dolphin, could later be correctly identified by the dolphin with the alternate sense modality with almost 100 per cent accuracy, in what is classically known in psychology and behaviorism as a match-to-sample test. The only errors noted were presumed to have been a misunderstanding of the task during the first few trials, and not an inability of the dolphin's perceptual apparatus. This capacity is strong evidence for abstract and conceptual thought in the dolphin's brain, wherein an idea of the object is stored and understood not merely by its sensory properties; such abstraction may be argued to be of the same kind as complex language, mathematics, and art, and implies a potentially very great intelligence and conceptual understanding within the brains of tursiops and possibly many other cetaceans. Accordingly, Lilly's interest later shifted to whale song and the possibility of high intelligence in the brains of large whales, and Louis Herman's research at the now misnomered Dolphin Institute in Honolulu, Hawaii, focuses exclusively on the Humpback whale.\n\n\nFrom Roman times to modern Brazil, dolphins have been known to drive fish toward fishermen waiting on shore, and signal to the fishermen when to throw their nets, even when water is too murky for the fishermen to see the arrival of the fish. The dolphins catch unnetted fish disoriented by the net.\n\nFrom about 1840-1920 orcas smacked the water off Twofold Bay in New South Wales to signal to human whalers that the orcas were herding large baleen whales nearby, so the humans would send boats to harpoon the whales, killing them faster and more assuredly than the orcas could. The orcas ate the tongues and lips, leaving the blubber and bones for the humans.\n\nBonnie Bergin trained dogs to go to specific text on the wall to ask clearly for \"water, treat or pet me.\" Dogs were able to learn English or Japanese text. She says service dogs can learn to find EXIT signs, bathroom gender signs, and report what disease they smell in a urine sample by going to a sign on the wall naming that disease.\n\nPolice and private dogs can be trained to \"alert\" when they find certain scents, including drugs, explosives, mines, scent of a suspect, fire accelerants, bed bugs. The alert can be a specific bark or position, and can be accepted as evidence in court.\n\nStanley Coren identifies 56 signals which untrained dogs make and people can understand, including 10 barks, 5 growls, 8 other vocalizations, 11 tail signals, 5 ear and eye positions, 5 mouth signals and 12 body positions. Faragó et al. describe research that humans can accurately categorize barks from unseen dogs as aggressive, playful, or stressed, even if they do not own a dog. This recognizability has led to machine learning algorithms to categorize barks, and commercial products and apps such as BowLingual, TalkWithYourDog, and TalkDog.\n\nDogs can be trained to understand hundreds of spoken words, including Chaser (1,022 words), \nBetsy (340 words), \nRico (200 words), \nand others.\n\nThey can react appropriately when a human uses verbs and nouns in new combinations, such as \"fetch ball\" or \"paw frisbee.\"\n\nBergin trained dogs to obey 20 written commands on flashcards, in Roman or Japanese characters, including 🚫 to keep them away from an area.\n\nShepherds and others have developed detailed commands to tell herding dogs when to move, stop, collect or separate herd animals.\n\nHumans teach animals specific responses for specific conditions or stimuli. Training may be for purposes such as companionship, detection, protection, research and entertainment. During training humans communicate their wishes with positive or negative reinforcement. After training is finished the human communicates by giving signals with words, whistles, gestures, body language, etc.\n\nAPOPO has trained Southern giant pouched rats to communicate to humans the presence of land mines, by scratching the ground, and tuberculosis in medical samples. They identify 40% more cases of tuberculosis than clinics do, an extra 12,000 cases from 2007-2017. They have identified 100,000 mines from 2003-2017, certifying 2,200 hectares (5,400 acres) as mine-free. They are accurate enough that the human trainers run on the land after removing the mines which rats have identified.\n\nRats (Wistar, \"Rattus norvegicus\") have been taught to distinguish and respond differently to different human faces.\n\nPatricia McConnell found that handlers around the world, speaking 16 languages, working with camels, dogs, donkeys, horses and water buffalo, all use long sounds with a steady pitch to tell animals to go more slowly (whoa, euuuuuu), and they use short repeated sounds, often rising in pitch, to speed them up or bring them to the handler (Go, Go, Go, claps, clicks). Chimpanzees, dogs, gulls, horses, rats, roosters, sheep and sparrows all use similar short repeated sounds to tell others of the same species to come closer.\n\nEven fish, which lack a neocortex, have been taught to distinguish and respond differently to different human faces (archerfish) or styles of music (goldfish and koi).\n\nMolluscs, with totally different brain designs, have been taught to distinguish and respond to symbols (cuttlefish and octopus), and have been taught that food behind a clear barrier cannot be eaten (squid).\n\nA harbor seal, Hoover learned to speak several phrases in understandable English as a pup from his human foster parent and used these in appropriate circumstances during his later life at the New England Aquarium until he died in 1985. Other talking animals have been studied, though they did not always use their phrases in meaningful contexts.\n\nThough animal communication has always been a topic of public comment and attention, for a period in history it surpassed this and became sensational popular entertainment. From the late 18th century through the mid 19th century, a succession of \"learned pigs\" and various other animals were displayed to the public in for-profit performances, boasting the ability to communicate with their owners (often in more than one language), write, solve math problems, and the like. One poster dated 1817 shows a group of \"Java sparrows\" who are advertised as knowing seven languages, including Chinese and Russian.\n\n\n\n"}

In both cases, readers and spectators see themselves in the fictional character.\n\nIdentification is usually supposed to be largely unconscious: a reader may be aware that she likes a given character, but not that she actually sees that character as an alter ego, a version of her, or a projection of her aspirations for herself. It would be a mistake to think all heroes foster identification, or that all villains inhibit identification—many, perhaps even most, characters elicit some degree of identification on the part of the reader or spectator. In film, Alfred Hitchcock exploited the traits of casual identification with specific moments, even when the character was villainous. In \"Psycho\" (1960), Hitchcock explained that as the character Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) was disposing of the car containing Marion Crane's body in a swamp, for a brief moment he had the car stop sinking. \"When Perkins is looking at the car sinking in the pond... the public are thinking, 'I hope it goes all the way down!' It's a natural instinct.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "44197290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44197290", "title": "International volunteering", "text": "International volunteering\n\nInternational volunteering is when volunteers contribute their time to work for organisations or causes outside their respective home countries. In most such cases, volunteers work in developing countries on international development programmes with local volunteer organisations that conduct activities such as health promotion, education and environmental conservation. Trends show that international volunteering has become increasingly popular across many countries over the past few decades. International volunteering is a broad term which is used to capture multi-year, skilled placements as well as short term roles, recently termed \"voluntourism\", and a range of activities in between conducted by governments, charities and travel agents.\n\nFormal overseas volunteering can be traced back over one hundred years to when the British Red Cross set up the \"Voluntary Aid Detachment\" (VAD) scheme in 1909. The VAD volunteers, as well as volunteers from many other national Red Cross organisations, worked in battlefields across Europe and the Middle East during World War I to treat soldiers and civilians regardless of the side they fought for.\nUp to the mid-20th century overseas volunteering projects were mainly undertaken by people with direct connections to a particular cause and were considered more as short term in nature. The more formal inception of international volunteering organisations can be linked to organisations such as Australian Volunteers International (formerly the \"Volunteer Graduate Scheme\") which formed in 1951, International Voluntary Services in 1953 in the United States, and Voluntary Services Overseas (VSO) in 1958 the United Kingdom. These services and that of the U.S. Peace Corps, established in 1961 during the Kennedy administration, paved the way for broader recognition of overseas volunteering in later years. During the 1960s and 1970s a movement of volunteerism and study abroad programs became popular among university students and graduates and the United Nations launched the UN Volunteers programme for young professionals to take part in a long-term (two year plus) overseas programme.\n\nIn recent years the accessibility of international volunteering has increased significantly with many smaller charities connecting volunteers with non-governmental organisations in developing countries. Travel companies have also increasingly been offering paid-for volunteering opportunities, this growth coincided with the increasing number of young people taking gap years and has been termed \"volunteer tourism\" and \"voluntourism\" to denote shorter-term voluntary work that is not necessarily the sole purpose of the trip. However, many opportunities medium- and long-term opportunities for skilled international volunteers remain, for example, the publicised role of volunteers in addressing the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa.\n\nInternational volunteering appeals to a broad cross-section of society, but the majority of volunteers are in their twenties and thirties, potentially due to perceptions of volunteering abroad being a more risky activity. The average age of VSO volunteers, however, is 38, showing a broad range of participation across age groups. Many participants use these trips to boost their resumes, travel with friends, gain world experience, and see new countries. Recently there has been an increase in baby boomer volunteers. One possible explanation for the increase is that these people are transitioning into a new stage of life and their focus may shift toward finding activities that give their life new meaning. Shorter-term voluntourism is therefore appealing to some, as it is targeted at travellers who want to make a positive change in the world, while still providing a touristic experience. People generally volunteer in order to increase their international awareness, to contextualize poverty and its effects, as an education opportunity, and to help people while having a morally rewarding experience. Many believe that the trip will change the way they think when they return home. However, others are just looking to give to others and do not believe that their experience will cause them to think twice about their lives back home.\n\nCertain critiques and challenges are associated with international volunteering.\n\nMeasuring the outcomes of international volunteering is an ongoing challenge. Sometimes the costs invested in these partnerships are high. The intangible nature of impact and outcomes is hard to measure and research has been proposed in this area. Similarly, how to measure the success of a volunteer and the supporting organisation's performance is complicated. To allow volunteers to integrate properly into the community, it is essential that volunteers have some useful skills and are reasonably well-informed and trained before the placement. Shannon O'Donnell, a vocal critic of poorly designed international programs, contends that many volunteer organizations compromise the dignity of local populations—these programs often foster a cyclical dependency international volunteers within the communities the programs are designed to serve.\n\nRelated to the impact of international volunteering, the cost of having an international volunteer has been cited as another area of concern, especially costs for air tickets, allowances, insurance, training and logistics. Local staff do require such costs, and the local organisations could put these funds into more important issues; however, many volunteers pay these expenses personally. Some institutions provide scholarships for international volunteering.\n\nVolunteers are far cheaper than other forms of long-term technical assistance because they live and work under local conditions. Expatriates who work in the same capacity can be paid multiple times more than any allowances volunteers receive (if any). The cost-benefit of international volunteers is hard to quantify, though studies have highlighted improvements in well-being and inter-cultural understanding in communities and schools as a result of international exchanges and volunteers.\n\nA consideration is that volunteers may dominate the workplace, undermine local management and work culture especially in small organisations. This is due to volunteers often being considered more highly educated than local staff, even if they do not have direct experience. Coming from a different culture can also lead to volunteers imposing their values on organisations.\n\nIndeed, volunteers can have a strong influence on organisations, especially those who deal with governance and management. However, volunteers are often trained to respect the local working culture and ethics. Also, since they report directly to local organisations, they can have their contracts terminated if they break any local regulations, which further minimises the fear of domination.\n\nInternational volunteers from outside the host community can lack an understanding of the local context and sometimes may not have the correct skill-set to achieve their project goal. There is sometimes a vetting or selection process for volunteers before they are recruited to serve in developing countries, but this process has at times been found wanting. According to some, international volunteers today receive significant training before and often during their placement which can address this deficit. Others counter that there are countless multinational organizations offering unskilled volunteer placements to any participant willing to pay the placement fee. In these circumstances, there is conflict about whether the fees volunteers pay justify the time spent supervising and revising their work, and if a sufficient portion of the fees make it into the local communities hosting volunteers. \nPeople volunteer for many reasons, but seldom does anyone volunteer strictly for monetary reasons, as very few organisations offer a stipend for volunteering. More compelling motives include experiencing another culture, meeting new people, and advancing one's career prospects. Such motivations are common among younger volunteers who are looking for experience or direction in their careers.\n\nA common motivation is to \"make a difference\" and to \"achieve something positive for others\" who are less fortunate than the volunteer. Many volunteers tend to concur that there are disadvantaged people in their home countries, but the scale of disadvantage outside their home countries is felt to be greater. Volunteering at home may elicit images of helping the less fortunate, or campaigning with a local pressure group. Volunteering abroad has tended to be associated with international development and bridging the divide between the rich and poor worlds. Volunteering abroad often seems a more worthy contribution in this context to the volunteers than work in their own country. This perspective is particularly true of volunteers who are older and looking for something more value-based as they near the end of their professional careers or after their children have left home.\n\nThere have been allegations from some quarters of neo-colonial advances disguised as an effort to tackle poverty, as some volunteer organisations are connected to national governments, e.g. the Peace Corps, which was set up by the American government. Despite this challenge, most volunteer organisations are non-governmental (NGOs) and are not influenced by government policies. The present structures of international volunteering are also often aimed at impacts on a local, community scale which is sharply in contrast with the macro-political government strategies of the colonial era.\n\nHowever, many academic journals elaborate that volunteers often have little knowledge or expertise in the work they do when volunteering abroad. This has raised concerns of its value. Frances Brown and Derek Hall write that this creates a neo-colonial narrative. They say the volunteer perspective is framed around the idea that Westerners with minimal experience can effect change in the Global South, just by nature of being from the West. This perpetuates the narrative of Western domination in a post-colonial world, and the need to \"save\" and \"help\" the Global South.\n\nVolunteer tourism, also known as \"voluntourism\", is a specific kind of international volunteering. It is characterized as being conducted by profit-making companies rather than charities, by the age of the participants, and by the length of time they volunteer abroad. Participants are often young adults (ages 15–30), the length of the trip is under a month, and the volunteering is regularly packaged with adventure and travel activities. Voluntourism has undergone intense scrutiny over the course of the 2000s, and an increasing number of academic papers question volunteer tourists' motivations and experiences.\n\nVolunteer-sending organizations, such as Free The Children's Me to We trips and the British company Projects-abroad, have been critiqued as furthering the aforementioned neo-colonial narrative to youth. The increased prevalence of promotional material regarding trips to \"help\" the Global South has \"increased media exposure in the Global North to poverty in the Global South.\" Critics argue that the way in which these organizations advertise their trips stigmatizes and frames the developing world as helpless. This plays into Maria Eriksson Baaz's theories in the book \"Paternalism of Partnership: a Postcolonial Reading of Identity in Development Aid\", in which she discusses discourse that frames the volunteer as a developed, paternalistic individual and the donor as underdeveloped. The framing and \"othering\" of cultures outside the West and Global North can also be found in Edward Said's text, \"Orientalism\". His theory is rooted in the same idea, in which he describes West's patronizing portrayals of the East.\n\nOther criticisms of the voluntourism industry are that not only are short-term volunteers often untrained in the projects they participate in (building schools, health centres, wells), but that projects can fuel conflict among communities, offer bandaid solutions, replace work locals could be doing, and reinforce neoliberal policies. Children in these communities may become dependent and commodified when volunteers are constantly arriving and departing every couple weeks. The rhetoric of such volunteer-sending organizations has also been argued to inform a \"consumer-capitalist\" culture that plays to the wants and needs of the privileged North, at the disadvantage of the Global South.\n\n"}

In 2001, when a massacre in the royal palace saw two kings die in less than a week, the “katto khane” ritual was reported very explicitly.\n\nThe ceremony is performed on the eleventh day of the King's death. In this ceremony a vegetarian Brahmin is made to eat a elaborate non-vegetarian meal, given various items belonging to the deceased King as gifts and made to wear clothing belonging to the deceased King in the belief that by doing so, the partaker will absorb all the bad karma of the dead king.

However, Ramesh Prasad Pande, the Royal Brahmin of the Shah dynasty of Nepal who oversaw the rituals after the Royal massacre in 2001 revealed that no such thing occurs, and such hearsay are just myths. Durga Prasad Sapkota and Devi Prasad Acharya who performed the katto ritual of King Birendra and King Dipendra revealed the same and said that the ritual is symbolic.

It tells a highly elaborated fictional version of the story of the love of the Sasanian king Khosrow II for the Armenian princess Shirin, who becomes queen of Persia. The essential narrative is a love story of Persian origin which was already well-known from the great epico-historical poem the Shahnameh and other Persian writers and popular tales, and other works have the same title.\n\nVariants of the story were also told under the titles \"Shirin and Farhad\" (Persian: شیرین و فرهاد).\n\nNezami's version begins with an account of Khosrow's birth and his education. This is followed by an account of Khosrow's feast in a farmer's house; for which Khosrow is severely chastised by his father. Khosrow asks forgiveness and repents his offence. Hormizd IV, who is now pleased with his son, forgives him. That very night, Khosrow sees his grandfather Anushirvan in a dream and Anushirvan gives him glad tidings of a wife named Shirin, a steed named Shabdiz, a musician named Barbad, and a great kingdom, that is Persia.\n\nShapur, Khosrow's close friend and a painter, tells Khosrow of the Armenian queen Mahin Banu and her niece Shirin. Hearing Shapur's descriptions of Shirin's flawless features, the young prince falls in love with Shirin, the Armenian princess. Shapur travels to Armenia to look for Shirin. Shapur finds Shirin and shows the image of Khosrow to Shirin. Shirin falls in love with Khosrow and escapes from Armenia to Khosrow's capital Mada'in; but meanwhile, Khosrow also flees from his father's anger and sets out for Armenia in search of Shirin.\n\nOn the way, he finds Shirin unclothed bathing and washing her flowing hair; Shirin also sees him; but since Khosrow was traveling in peasant clothes, they do not recognize one another. Khosrow arrives in Armenia and is welcomed by Shamira the queen of Armenia - yet he finds out that Shirin is in Mada'in. Again, Shapur is sent to bring Shirin. When Shirin reached Armenia again, Khosrow – because of his father's death- has to return to Mada'in. The two lovers keep going to opposite places till finally Khosrow is overthrown by a general named Bahrām Chobin and flees to Armenia.\n\nIn Armenia, Khosrow finally meets Shirin and is welcomed by her. Shirin, however, does not agree to marry Khosrow; unless Khosrow first claims his country back from Bahram Chobin. Thus, Khosrow leaves Shirin in Armenia and goes to Constantinople. The Caesar agrees to assist him against Bahram Chobin on condition that he marry his daughter Mariam. Khosrow is also forced to promise not to marry as long as Mariam is alive. Khosrow succeeds in defeating his enemy and reclaims his throne. Mariam, due to her jealousy, keeps Khosrow away from Shirin.\n\nMeanwhile, a sculptor named Farhad falls in love with Shirin and becomes Khosrow's love-rival. Khosrow cannot abide Farhad, so he sends him as an exile to Behistun mountain with the impossible task of carving stairs out of the cliff rocks. Farhad begins his task hoping that Khosrow will allow him to marry Shirin. Yet, Khosrow sends a messenger to Farhad and gives him false news of Shirin's death. Hearing this false news, Farhad throws himself from the mountaintop and dies. Khosrow writes a letter to Shirin, expressing his regret for Farhad's death. Soon after this incident, Mariam also dies. According to Ferdowsi's version, it was Shirin who secretly poisoned Mariam. Shirin replies to Khosrow's letter with another satirical letter of condolences.\n\nKhosrow, before proposing marriage to Shirin, tries to have intimacy with another woman named Shekar in Isfahan, which further delays the lovers' union. Finally, Khosrow goes to Shirin's castle to see her. Shirin, seeing that Khosrow is drunk, does not let him in the castle. She particularly reproaches Khosrow for his intimacy with Shekar. Khosrow, sad and rejected, returns to his palace.\n\nShirin eventually consents to marry Khosrow after several romantic and heroic episodes. Yet, Shiroyeh, Khosrow's son from his wife Mariam, is also in love with Shirin. Shiroyeh finally murders his father Khosrow and sends a messenger to Shirin conveying that after one week, she would have to marry him. Shirin, in order to avoid marrying Shiroy, kills herself. Khosrow and Shirin were buried together in one grave.\n\nThere are many references to the legend throughout the poetry of other Persian poets including Farrokhi, Qatran, Mas'ud-e Sa'd-e Salman, Othman Mokhtari, Naser Khusraw, Anwari and Sanai. Nizam al-Mulk mentioned that the legend was a popular story in his era.\n\nAlthough the story was known before Nizami, it was brought to its greatest romantic height by him. Unlike the \"Shahnameh\", which focuses on the history, kingship and battles of Khosrow, Nizami decided to focus on the romantic aspect of the story.\n\nWhen the Seljuq Sultan Arsalan Shah requested a love epic from the poet without specifying the subject further, Nizami picked on the story of lovers Khosrow and Shirin, a theme set in his own region and based on at least partly historical facts, though an aura of legend already surrounded it.\n\nNizami Ganjavi (1141–1209) himself considered it the sweetest story in the world:\n\nIt is believed to be one of the best works of Nizami. His first wife Afaq died after it was completed. Many versions of Nizami's work have been retold. The story has a constant forward drive with exposition, challenge, mystery, crisis, climax, resolution, and finally, catastrophe.\n\nBesides Ferdowsi, Nizami's poem was influenced by Asad Gorgani and his \"Vis and Rāmin\". which is of the same meter and has similar scenes. Nizami's concern with astrology also has a precedent in the elaborate astrological description of the night sky in \"Vis and Ramin\". Nizami had a paramount influence on the romantic tradition, and Gorgani can be said to have initiated much of the distinctive rhetoric and poetic atmosphere of this tradition, with the absence of the Sufi influences, which are seen in Nizami's epic poetry.\n\nAccording to the \"Encyclopædia Iranica\": \"The influence of the legend of Farhad is not limited to literature, but permeates the whole of Persian culture, including folklore and the fine arts. Farhad's helve supposedly grew into a tree with medicinal qualities, and there are popular laments for Farhad, especially among the Kurds (Mokri).\"\n\nIn 2011, the Iranian government's censors refused permission for a publishing house to reprint the centuries-old classic poem that had been a much-loved component of Persian literature for 831 years. While the Iranian Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance offered no immediate official explanation for refusing to permit the firm to publish their eighth edition of the classic, the Islamic government's concerns reportedly centered on the \"indecent\" act of the heroine, Shirin, in embracing her husband.\n\nOrhan Pamuk's novel \"My Name Is Red\" (1998) has a plot line between two characters, Shekure and Black, which echoes the Khosrow and Shirin story, which is also retold in the book. The novel uses the Turkish spelling of Khosrow's name, Hüsrev.\n\nThe tale has been retold by countless Sufi poets and writers in areas which were previously part of the Persian Empire or had Persian influences, such as the northern parts of the neighboring Indian subcontinent. In Europe, the story was told by Hungarian novelist Mór Jókai. However, the story is usually told under the name of \"Shirin Farhad\". It is a standard tale used in Punjabi Qisse. The story has been filmed five times:\n1926,\n1931,\n1945,\n1956 starring Madhubala and Pradeep Kumar and\n1975.\n\nThe tale was used as the inspiration for a 2008 Iranian film, \"Shirin\", made by Abbas Kiarostami. In this formally unusual film, the story is told via the reactions of an audience of Iranian women as they sit watching the film in a cinema. The viewer has to divine the story by only ever seeing these emoting faces and listening to the film's soundtrack.\n\nThe story was also referenced in the Jonathan Richman song \"Shirin and Farhad\"\n\nThe tale was also an inspiration for the 2012 Bollywood romantic comedy \"Shirin Farhad Ki Toh Nikal Padi\".\n\n\n"}

The special is presented as a parody of self-help infomercials, advertising a four-step program for creating a digital avatar that acts a backup of its host. The special is hosted by Alan Resnick as himself, and is presented by Dan Deacon. Both, along with O'Brien, are members of the Baltimore-based art collective Wham City, who co-produced the episode under their video production division, AB Video Solutions.\n\nThe special aired on December 24, 2013 at 4 a.m. on Cartoon Network's late-night programming block, Adult Swim. The special was viewed by 926,000 viewers and received a Nielsen household rating of 0.7. Critical reception was positive, with both the humor and the performances receiving praise.\n\nAlan Resnick (portrayed by himself), an emerging young tech expert and innovator, is introduced to the viewer. He tells the audience of his four-step program to create a digital avatar that acts as a backup of its host, granting \"the secret to eternal life\". He tells the audience of his past: two years ago, Resnick was banished to his couch after getting into a lovers' spat with his wife, Janet. He dreamt of himself in a foggy meadow with an attractive, nude young woman (portrayed by \"MKNZ\") who calls for him to engage in sex. He initially refuses, but then changes his mind, but before they are able to do so, he is shot with a gun by a nameless man (Ben O'Brien), which totally destroys his face. This gave him the idea to come up with a way to digitally back himself up. Two months pass, and he is able to create an \"exact digital copy\" of himself who calls himself \"Teddy\" (for unknown reasons). \"Teddy\", a floating avatar head, acts as the co-host for the remainder of the program, often interrupting Resnick's speech to talk about his \"wife\".\n\nResnick goes on to explain the four steps behind his process:\n\nVarious testimonials are then given; a widower and \"textbook salesman\" Ryan Syrell (Steve Izant) tells of the reconstruction of his wife Morgan and the creation of his own avatar. Jordan Card, an elderly woman, shows off her digital avatar, who insists that their room \"is too cold.\" Chester Gwazda (Caynen Couture), a young bedridden boy, says that it was his mother's (Michelle Word) idea, and that he would rather play football than go boogie boarding with his avatar. Concluding his seminar, Resnick thanks his audience and \"Teddy\", who speaks again of the love for his wife, shown to be a pink morphing sphere. A frustrated Resnick scolds his creation and informs the audience that his avatar is autonomous, and that he is being manipulative and disappointing. He reminds the viewer to purchase his program through the following informational screen.\n\nThe series was originally developed as a comedy sketch by Alan Resnick, as part of his comedy tours with the Baltimore-based art collective Wham City, best known for their work with Dan Deacon. The skit, first conceived in 2009 and roughly modeled after TED Talks, features Resnick telling the audience how to create a complete digital backup of himself. Long-time associate Ben O'Brien co-produced, directed and edited the special along with Resnick. In addition, both co-produced the episode under their video production division, AB Video Solutions. Resnick, along with set decorator Emma Alamo, transformed Resnick's house into the set of the special.\n\nThe collective had pitched a Wham City television sitcom to Adult Swim before, but according to Resnick, the network insisted that \"no one would ever watch more than one episode.\" Resnick named \"Mr. Show with Bob and David\", \"The Kids in the Hall\" and the \"Upright Citizens Brigade\" as influences on the special. Dave Hughes, creator of the series \"Off the Air\", who had discussed with the group about developing a series, took note of Resnick's sketch and helped the collective develop it into an infomercial. After airing the special, Wham City featured the skit for their comedy tour of New York City. Resnick informed Network Awesome that they will probably not produce any more fake infomercials, and that O'Brien is working with the network to create something that viewers will \"stumble on unintentionally.\"\n\n\"Live Forever as You Are Now with Alan Resnick\" aired on December 24, 2013 at 4 a.m. on Adult Swim. It was the third in a series of infomercial parodies broadcast by the network, succeeding \"Broomshakalaka\" and \"For-Profit Online University\". The early-morning timeslot was chosen since infomercials usually air during such hours. The special was published onto Adult Swim's YouTube channel the same day. The special was viewed by 926,000 viewers and received a Nielsen household rating of 0.7, meaning that approximately 0.7 percent of households with a television watched it. A web chat allowing users to converse with \"Teddy\" was created for the network's website.\n\nThe special has received positive critical reception. In talking about Resnick with regards to the special, \"Baltimore City Paper\" Baynard Woods wrote that it \"combines the traditional kind-of-creepy positivity of the infomercial host with the creepy techno-utopian positivity of a TED Talk's technologist.\" He ultimately opined that the humor derived from \"the disconnect between what Resnick claims—that his avatar is a complete backup of himself—and the reality that it is not at all like him and is, in fact, extremely limited.\" Ezra Lefko of \"What Weekly\", another Baltimore-based publication, praised the special. In particular, he expressed his approval of seeing \"success and national exposure for these talented artists.\" Lea McLellan of \"Mountain Xpress\" called it \"hilarious\" and \"a good representation of their bizarre comedic stylings.\"\n\n\n"}

It was the primary language of several peoples of New England, including the Massachusett in the area roughly corresponding to Boston, Massachusetts, including much of the Metrowest and South Shore areas just to the west and south of the city; the Wampanoag, who still inhabit Cape Cod and the Islands, most of Plymouth and Bristol counties and south-eastern Rhode Island, including some of the small islands in Narragansett Bay; the Nauset, who may have rather been an isolated Wampanoag sub-group, inhabited the extreme ends of Cape Cod; the Coweset of northern Rhode Island and the Pawtucket which covered most of north-eastern Massachusetts and the lower tributaries of the Merrimack River and coast of New Hampshire, and the extreme southernmost point of Maine. Massachusett was also used as a common second language of peoples throughout New England and Long Island, particularly in a simplified pidgin form.\n\nThe missionary John Eliot learned the language from bilingual translators and interpreters, and used the Latin alphabet and English-style orthographical conventions in an \"ad hoc\" fashion. By the 1650s, Eliot had begun translating portions of the Bible, some published, that were distributed to the Indians, and the Indians that learned to read became active agents in the spread of literacy. Eliot used the dialect of the Massachusett, specifically the speech of Natick. This caused dialect leveling to the \"de facto\" standard, as it was used by Eliot to translate and print the first Bible in the Americas, albeit in the Massachusett tongue. Several other missionaries fluent in the language offered missionary tracts and translations. By the 1670s, one in three Indians were literate only twenty years after Eliot's first translations. As a result of the use of Natick speech and writing, dialectal differences were quickly lost. The language faded as Indians faced increasing dispossession and assimilation pressures, with the last speakers dying off at the tale end of the nineteenth century.\n\nIn 1993, Jessie Little Doe Baird (née Fermino), co-founded the Wopanaak Reclamation Project in an effort to bring the language back to her people, and even studied as a linguist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology under linguists Kenneth Hale and later Norvin Richards. In 2000, at the completion of her studies, Baird introduced a new orthography, still Latin-based, and inspired by the colonial system but represented a one-to-one correlation between sound and spelling.\n\nPrior to the introduction of literacy by the missionary Eliot, the Massachusett-speaking peoples were mainly an orally transmitted culture, with social taboos, mores, customs, legends, history, knowledge and traditions passed from the elders to the next generation through song, stories and discussion. With peoples from further away, speakers switched to a pidgin variety of Massachusett used across New England, but when spoken language failed, sign language was used. Little is known about the Eastern Woodlands Algonquian sign language other than its usage. Lenape were often recruited in the wars with the Indians of the west because of their ability to effectively communicate in silence. Even American Sign Language was likely influenced by the sign language of the Wampanoag of Martha's Vineyard, who interacted with a large population of English colonists who were deaf and signed. Martha's Vineyard Sign Language went extinct at the beginning of the twentieth century, but many of its users were influential in the development of ASL. Little is known of it other than its existence, but it was likely similar in scope and usage such as extant Plains Indian Sign Language.\n\nPictographs carved into the rocks date back to the middle Archaic Period, ca. 6000-4000 BC up until a century after colonization. Most notorious are the etchings on Dighton Rock in the Taunton River but also several sites around Assawompset Pond. The figures depicted on Dighton Rock are similar to those of Bellows Falls, Vermont and other sites across New England. Most depictions include carved hands, the sun, the moon in various phases, people or spirits, anthropomorphic beings, various native animals, markings similar to the letters 'E,' 'M,' 'X,' and 'I,' slashes an crosses, circles that may represent planetary figures, trees, river courses and figures from shamanic tradition like giants, thunderbirds and horned serpents. During and after colonization, some depict Europeans and ships. Many are carved near water, and probably because these were sacred sites, commemorated historic agreements or to mark the land.\n\nEarly adopters of literacy are known to have signed their names with animal symbols related to their tribe, clan or stature. For a century after English arrival, the Indians continued to mark rocks and trees, and one site in Massachusetts features a large boulder, with depictions of wetus from as far back as 3000 years old, to depictions of ships shortly after the period of English settlement began, and a few drawings and the Latin letters of the owner's name, where a Wampanoag family was present until the early twentieth century. As late as the 1920s, Nipmuc women in central Massachusetts, a people closely connected culturally and linguistically with the Massachusett-speaking peoples, still made traditional baskets that were often decorated with woven or painted symbols representing the local landscape, such as the use of domed figures for homes (wetus), dots for people, parallel and diagonal lines to represent plots of land and other symbols whose meaning are lost. It is unknown whether or not the basketry traditions represent a continuation or have any connection to the earlier petro- and dendroglyph traditions.\n\n\nAs Eliot listened to the Indians from the Praying Town of Natick, he wrote them according to English orthography, which later developed into the colonial system in use from the 1650s until the mid-nineteenth century. Eliot used the entire Latin alphabet as used in English at the time, to write the language.\n\nVowels could be marked with the acute accent ( ´ ) or the circumflex ( ˆ ) over the vowel. As a general rule, the acute accent served to mark stress or lengthen a vowel and the circumflex was used to mark nasal vowels. However, colonial ô was consistently used for /ã/ whereas â was used to mark nasal vowels as well as the long vowel /aː/. Both the Indians and the English missionaries used these accent marks sparingly, but when they were employed, usage was inconsistent and sometimes interchangeable.\n\nThe possible vowels with diacritics include acute accent Á, É, Í, Ó and Ú as well as circumflex accent Â, Ê, Î, Ô and Û. Only Â and Ô are in common use, the other vowels with circumflexes are only rarely attested and generally used where, prescriptively, an acute accent would be used. They do serve as disambiguation, for example, e could represent /ə/ such as in hettuog (hutuwôk) , 'speech,' /iː/ in ken (keen) , 'you' or the /j/ in wepitteash, but é always represents /iː/, as in wunnékin (wuneekun) , 'it is good.' At other times, the marks are confusing, as in the case of what would be (awasuw) in the modern orthography, 'he warms himself,' which was written as auwossu, ouwassu, âwosu (suggesting ) and auwósu (suggesting ) in the colonial script.\n\nAs the Massachusett orthography was first committed to writing just around 1650, based on an adaptation of the Latin alphabet and English orthography, it adopted aspects of Early Modern English conventions that disappeared in England by the late seventeenth century, but probably lingered a few generations later in the American colonies due to isolation. Since John Eliot wrote at this time, it was natural that orthographical conventions in use were transferred into Massachusett. It shares the following features:\n\nThe modern, phonetic system in use by the (Wôpanâak) Language Reclamation Project was first introduced by Baird with her publication of \"An Introduction to Wampanoag Grammar\" in 2000 after the completion of her Master's in Algonquian Linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The writing system was based to fit to the phonology of the language. Baird was easily able to find the vocabulary and Massachusett radicals from the large body of missionary translations and personal letters and records of literate Indians, but pronunciation was pieced together with clues in the early writing as well as application of sound change and other patterns of development from Proto-Algonquian.\n\nThe most striking feature of the new orthography is substitution of (8) for the double-o ligature ꝏ of the colonial period. This was done to ease inputting, rendering and printing and possibly because of its resemblance to the ou-ligature ȣ used in Algonquin and Abenaki Latin-script orthographies, although the Abenaki have also replaced ȣ with 8 for similar reasons. For example, historical mꝏs (Massachusett) and mȣs (Abenaki) and WLRP (m8s). Inspired by the colonial script, the modern orthography uses (â) and (ô) which resemble A and O with circumflexes, but modern usage restricts the former to represent /aː/ and the latter /ã/ whereas any vowel with a circumflex usually indicated nasality in the colonial script. These are considered letters in their own respective right, and not vowels with diacritics, in the modern orthographical system.\n\nAs the WLRP favors resurrecting old vocabulary, neologisms based on Massachusett radicals or use of forms from other extant languages over the use of English loan words, the new alphabet noticeably lacks the letters F, L, V and R, used only in loan words, as well as B, C, D, G, J, and Z that were previously used in both loans and native words as alternates to their respective voiced or unvoiced counterparts. Although excluded from the alphabet, these letters are used to write proper names and some loans from English as all speakers and language learners and speakers today are native English speakers in a predominately English-speaking nation. X, which mainly appears in rare syncopated versions of native words and English loan words, now only appears in loan words, but was originally used in dialects that allowed for syncopation.\n\nThe Modern orthography lacks the confusing array of multiple, often contradictory, spellings, essentially representing a one-to-one correspondence between sound and spelling. It lacks gemination (letter doubling), silent E's, letter thorn, excessive English loan words and frustratingly variant spellings of the previous system.\n\nA few exceptions to the general rule exist. (Q) as /kʷ/ before vowels and /k/ elsewhere, where (K) would be expected. The reason for this is because it prevents alternations between (Q) and (K) when medial and final radicals are appended, it would remain (Q) before certain ones and (K) elsewhere. For example, in Colonial spelling, the word for 'bear' was moſk or moſhk (but also moſhq and moſq), but when any endings, such as the plural or obviative endings are attached, Q was always used, often accompanied by U, e.g., masquog or mosquohwhereas the modern orthography avoids this alteration by using (Q) in all cases, with a simple rule to gleam its proper pronunciation, hence modern (masq) , 'bear,' (masqash), 'bears' and (masqah) 'bear' (obviative).\n\n(TE) and the letter (TY) produce essentially the same alveo-palatal /tʲ/ sound, although there is a slight difference in their respective origins which is distinguished in the orthography. The letter (TY) represents palatization of /k/, which occurs when /k/ is followed by /ə/, if that /ə/ is etymologically a weakened form of PEA *ī, which is in turn followed by either /hp/, /p/, /m/, /hk/ or /k/. Palatization is also triggered when /k/ is followed by /aː/, which derives from PEA *ē, and /əw/, which remains unchanged from PEA *əw. For example, (weekuw), 'it is his/her house,' vs. (weety8), 'house,' both derive from Proto-Algonquian *wi·kiw[a·ʔmi] and (sôtyum) from Proto-Algonquian *sa·kima·wa.\n\n(TE) is actually (T) followed by (E), the latter is used to represent vowel affection. In Massachusett, this involves /j/-insertion before vowels that follow /iː/ or /ə/ but after /n/, /h/, /t/ or /ht/. For example, (weeputeash) , 'his teeth.' In both cases, the /ə/ descends etymologically from Proto-Eastern Algonquian /iː/. Although similar, infection often occurs as a replacement for a vowel that was once present. For instance, Massachusett (weeputeash) descends from Proto-Algonquian *wi·pitiari. (E) is used similarly to the Colonial orthography, where E was used in analogous positions. Although (E) is taken as /j/, most current speakers, and likely historical speakers, pronounce it as /jᵊ/ which is represented here.\n\nThe colonial orthography used the ligature letter ꝏ generally represented /uː/ but was also used in place of /wə/ and /əw/, whereas these sounds are represented in the modern orthography as (8), (wu) and (uw), respectively. In rapid speech, /uː/ and /əw/ can be confused, for example, Colonial hettꝏonk vs. Modern (hutuwôk) , 'speech.'\n"}
{"id": "7845053", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7845053", "title": "Meet Dave", "text": "Meet Dave\n\nMeet Dave is a 2008 American comedy science fiction film directed by Brian Robbins and written by Bill Corbett and Rob Greenberg. It stars Eddie Murphy, Elizabeth Banks, Gabrielle Union, Ed Helms, Scott Caan and Kevin Hart. The film was released on July 11, 2008.\n\nThe film was released on July 11, 2008, received generally negative reviews and grossed $50 million against its $60 million budget.\n\nIn his New York City apartment, a young boy named Josh Morrison (Austyn Lind Myers) stares through his telescope at an object falling from the sky. It is a golf-ball-sized metal ball which flies through the window and lands in his fishbowl, quickly draining the water along with the goldfish. He decides to show it at his school's science class presentation.\n\nSome months later a massive fireball crashes into the water near Liberty Island. It is revealed to be a spaceship which resembles a human (Eddie Murphy), controlled by 100 tiny humanoid aliens. Its Captain (also played by Murphy) pilots the spaceship from the command deck located in its head, with the help of his second-in-command Number 2 (Ed Helms), and researcher Number 3 (Gabrielle Union). The spaceship looks very human, and displays numerous superpowers, but the aliens don't know how to make the \"ship\" act like a human. A superstitious cop named Dooley (Scott Caan) desperately searches for the alien.\n\nThe aliens need to save their planet, Nil, from an energy crisis. They need salt, which they plan to take by draining the Earth's oceans using the metal ball, so they have to recover the ball. After the spaceship is hit by Josh's single mother, Gina Morrison (Elizabeth Banks), while driving, the Captain decides to befriend Gina and Josh. He tells them his name is Dave Ming Chang, based on a quick scan of common Earth names. At Gina's home the crew see their missing ball in a photograph taken at the science presentation. After having breakfast with Gina, \"Dave\" goes to Josh's school where he pretends to be a substitute teacher and eventually is able to talk to Josh alone. Josh tells him that the ball was taken from him by a bully (Nicholas Berman). With Josh's help, Dave takes the metal ball back from the bully.\n\nThe Captain (via Dave) spends some time with Josh and Gina and realizes that humans are more advanced than they originally thought. The crew observes humans displaying feelings and love, such as witnessing Gina's painting or a homeless man offering to share his blanket with Dave when he sleeps in a doorway. The Captain decides to cancel the plan to drain the oceans because it would destroy life on Earth. The police track Dave down using the impression of his face found in the dirt at the crash site and they arrest him. After spending so much time on Earth, most of the crew begin to exhibit new \"feelings\", adopting Earth's culture, mannerisms and general laid-back attitude. Number 2 decides that the Captain and the rest of the crew's changing behavior is unacceptable and takes command of the \"ship\", imprisoning the Captain. Under Number 2's command, Dave breaks out of the police station and another attempt is made to arrest him. Number 3, who has become infatuated with the Captain, becomes jealous of Gina. She first cooperates in the command change but later agrees with the Captain's view on humans. Both are caught by Number 2 and they are expelled from the spaceship. In the meantime, Number 17 (Kevin Hart), a young, fun-loving alien, jumps out of the \"ship\" while drunk from the alcohol Dave has imbibed. The Captain apologizes to Number 3 for ignoring her. He admits that he too loves her and wants to be with her. Back at the police station, Dooley discovers Number 17 in his coffee and interrogates him to find out where Dave is going.\n\nNumber 2 takes Dave to the harbor, where he tries to throw the metal orb into the ocean, but is stopped by the Captain and Number 3, both of whom managed to gain reentry back onto the ship. They convince the rest of the crew that the real Captain is in charge again. Reinstated, he orders Number 2 to be stuck in the ship's \"butt\" forever. The metal orb meanwhile slips out of Dave's hand and rolls into the ocean. The Captain attempts to retrieve the orb but is told that they only have enough power to either retrieve it or return home. The Captain decides to save the Earth and the rest of the crew agrees. The ball, thrown in the ocean by Number 2, is retrieved. Dave powers down while Dooley and his partner catch up and point their guns at him. With no power, Dave's shields are disabled, leaving the crew defenseless. Josh tries to tell the police officers that Dave is harmless but is ignored. He then grabs Dooley's taser which he uses on Dave, recharging him. The Captain and Number 3 reveal themselves to the police officers who stand down. The Captain says goodbye to Josh and Gina saying he now understands love. Number 17 is then returned to Dave by Dooley. About to fly away, a team from the FBI arrives and throws a net over Dave. While the FBI agents wrestle the body down, \"Dave's\" crew evacuates to one of the ship's \"lifeboat\" shoes, activate the engines, detaches the shoe and heads home to Nil, leaving behind both the ship and Number 2. While in the lifeboat, the Captain asks for Number 3's hand in marriage. She accepts and they kiss.\n\n\nScreenwriter Bill Corbett originally pitched the story for SciFi.com, the website for the Sci Fi Channel, which previously aired \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\", where Corbett worked as a writer and actor. The concept was eventually dropped and Corbett, along with other MST3K alumni, instead developed the online mini-series \"The Adventures of Edward the Less\" for the site. Corbett later revived the idea for a movie and discussed it with friend and fellow writer Rob Greenberg, who would become his screenwriting partner for the project. Although both writers acknowledged several other \"little people inside big people\" movies had been made in the past, Corbett thought the aspect of an entire \"Star Trek\" like crew operating a human being bore some originality.\n\nDuring filming, \"Meet Dave\" was transferred from Paramount Pictures (which released many of Murphy's early films) to 20th Century Fox (which released \"Dr. Dolittle\").\n\n\"Meet Dave\" was written under the title \"Starship Dave\", but studio executives insisted on a title change in part because of the poor box office performance of \"The Adventures of Pluto Nash\", a 2002 science-fiction comedy that also starred Eddie Murphy. Corbett said the executives also wanted the title changed because they felt having any semblance of science-fiction in the title would isolate a large percentage of audiences. Corbett unsuccessfully argued against changing the title, which he described as \"beyond generic\" and said was repetitive of a comedy released earlier in the year called \"Meet Bill\".\n\nAlthough the project as it was originally conceived appealed to both children and slightly older audiences, the final script aimed for a much more solidly family-based audience. Corbett and Greenberg wrote the original draft and some subsequent drafts and, although they were given the sole writing credit, Corbett said other writers \"have romped through the script as well,\" including one unnamed writer who spent one week adding material after the final draft was submitted. A large amount of improvising and rewriting was also done on the set, and Corbett and Greenberg had little creative control during filming. Corbett said most of the people they worked with were pleasant and some of the notes from the studio were helpful, but that \"Meet Dave\" ultimately suffered from a \"too-many-cooks thing.\"\n\nFilming was expected to begin in March 2007. As of early June, they were filming scenes at the Statue of Liberty in New York City. There was also some filming in early 2007 at an elementary school in Pasadena, California.\n\nMeet Dave: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was composed by John Debney and released by Varèse Sarabande. He recorded his score with the Hollywood Studio Symphony at the Newman Scoring Stage in February 2008.\n\n\"Meet Dave\" began receiving criticism and virulence months before it was actually released, especially by die-hard film fans Corbett compared to the Comic Book Guy character in \"The Simpsons\". Greenberg enjoyed reading the negative comments on the Internet Movie Database, whereas Corbett said he would \"rather take an acid bath\" than read them. Corbett, who did not see the final film until after it was widely released, said he did not know how the final result would come out:\n\nMurphy skipped the \"Meet Dave\" premiere because he was working on the (subsequently-delayed) comedy \"A Thousand Words\". Screenwriter Bill Corbett also missed the premiere, which he said was due to family plans, \"not an act of protest, per se\".\n\n\"Meet Dave\" grossed $11.8 million in the United States and Canada and $38.8 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $50.7 million, against its production budget of $60 million.\n\nThe film opened on July 11, 2008, in 3,011 theaters in North America and grossed $5.3 million, ranking seventh at the box office. 20th Century Fox distribution executive Bert Livingston said, \"It was a tough concept to get across. It's upsetting for all of us and for Eddie. He's very funny in this. Just not enough people came.\"\n\nIn its third weekend, it broke the record for the highest number of theater drops for a film in wide release, losing 2,523 theaters (77%). It held the record until \"Live by Night\" was dropped from 2,659 theaters (94.1%) in January 2017.\n\nReview aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 19% based on 101 reviews, with an average rating of 4.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Easy gags and slack direction drag this occasionally clever alien-out-of-planet comedy down to unimaginative lows.\" Another review aggregator, Metacritic, gave the film a score of 43 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nThe film's poor performance became a joke for comedians. Jay Leno said that the film's title was going to be changed to \"Meet Dave: At Blockbuster\", insinuating that the movie should have been a straight-to-DVD release. In the also Fox-produced \"Family Guy\" episode \"Friends of Peter G\", during the \"Mr. Booze\" song number, Carl mentioned that since he started drinking, he has never left his couch and has seen every movie ever made. \"Meet Dave\" is the first movie called out, and Carl mentions he has seen it.\n\nBill Corbett said he would love to record a \"Meet Dave\" track on RiffTrax, a site featuring downloadable audio commentaries recorded by \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" alum Michael J. Nelson and other regular commentators, including Corbett. Corbett said the track was not likely to ever be recorded since comedies rarely work as spoofs. A reference to the film was included in the RiffTrax Presents commentary for \"Planet of the Apes\" recorded by Matthew J. Elliott (in which he suggested that the filmmaker's original intention had been to launch Charlton Heston's character into space inside a giant Eddie Murphy), as well as the commentary for \"The Day After Tomorrow\" recorded by Corbett and Kevin Murphy, in which Corbett claims the natural phenomena hitting Los Angeles were \"almost as big a Hollywood disaster as \"Meet Dave\"s box office\".\nIt was nominated for two Razzie Awards, Worst Actor (Eddie Murphy) and Worst Screen Couple (Eddie Murphy \"in\" Eddie Murphy).\n\n"}
{"id": "1072855", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1072855", "title": "Moorish Science Temple of America", "text": "Moorish Science Temple of America\n\nThe Moorish Science Temple of America is an American national and religious organization founded by Noble Drew Ali. He based it on the premise that African Americans are descendants of the Moabites and thus are Moorish by nationality, and Islamic by faith. Ali put together elements of major traditions to develop a message of personal transformation through historical education, racial pride and spiritual uplift. His doctrine was also intended to provide African Americans with a sense of identity in the world and to promote civic involvement.\n\nOne primary tenet of the Moorish Science Temple is the belief that African Americans are of Moorish ancestry, specifically from the \"Moroccan Empire.\" According to Ali, this area included other countries that today surround Morocco. To join the movement, individuals had to proclaim their \"Moorish nationality.\" They were given \"nationality cards.\" In religious texts, adherents refer to themselves racially as \"Asiatics,\" as the Middle East is also western Asia. Adherents of this movement are known as \"Moorish-American Moslems\" and are called \"Moorish Scientists\" in some circles.\n\nThe Moorish Science Temple of America was incorporated under the Illinois Religious Corporation Act 805 ILCS 110. Timothy Drew, known to its members as Prophet Noble Drew Ali, founded the Moorish Science Temple of America in 1913 in Newark, New Jersey, a booming industrial city. After some difficulties, Ali moved to Chicago, establishing a center there, as well as temples in other major cities. The movement expanded rapidly during the late 1920s. The quick expansion of the Moorish Science Temple arose in large part from the search for identity and context among black Americans at the time of the Great Migration to northern and midwestern cities, as they were becoming an urbanized people.\n\nCompeting factions developed among the congregations and leaders, especially after the death of the charismatic Ali. Three independent organizations developed from this ferment. The founding of the Nation of Islam by Wallace Fard Muhammad in 1930 also created competition for members. In the 1930s membership was estimated at 30,000, with one third in Chicago. During the postwar years, the Moorish Science Temple of America continued to increase in membership, albeit at a slower rate.\n\nTimothy Drew was believed to have been born on January 8, 1886 in North Carolina, United States. Sources differ as to his background and upbringing: one reports he was the son of two former slaves who was adopted by a tribe of Cherokee; another describes Drew as the son of a Moroccan Muslim father and a Cherokee mother. In 2014 an article in the online \"Journal of Race Ethnicity and Religion\" attempted to link Timothy Drew to one Thomas Drew, born January 8, 1886, using census records, a World War I draft card, and street directory records.\n\nDrew Ali reported that during his travels, he met with a high priest of Egyptian magic. In one version of Drew Ali's biography, the leader saw him as a reincarnation of the founder. In others, he claims that the priest considered him a reincarnation of Jesus, the Buddha, Muhammad and other religious prophets. According to the biography, the high priest trained Ali in mysticism and gave him a \"lost section\" of the Quran.\n\nThis text came to be known as the \"Holy Koran of the Moorish Science Temple of America\" (not to be confused with the Islamic \"Quran\"). It is also known as the \"Circle Seven Koran\" because of its cover, which features a red \"7\" surrounded by a blue circle. The first 19 chapters are from \"The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ,\" published in 1908 by esoteric Ohio preacher Levi Dowling. In \"The Aquarian Gospel\", Dowling described Jesus's supposed travels in India, Egypt, and Palestine during the years of his life which are not accounted for by the New Testament.\n\nChapters 20 through 45 are borrowed from the Rosicrucian work, \"Unto Thee I Grant\" with minor changes in style and wording. They are instructions on how to live, and the education and duties of adherents.\n\nDrew Ali wrote the last four chapters of the Circle Seven Koran himself. In these he wrote:\n\nDrew Ali and his followers used this material to claim, \"Jesus and his followers were Asiatic.\" (\"Asiatic\" was the term Drew Ali used for all dark or olive-colored people; he labeled all whites as European. He suggested that all Asiatics should be allied.)\n\nDrew Ali crafted Moorish Science from a variety of sources, a \"network of alternative spiritualities that focused on the power of the individual to bring about personal transformation through mystical knowledge of the divine within\". In the inter-war years in Chicago and other major cities, he used these concepts to preach racial pride and uplift. His approach appealed to thousands of African Americans who had left severely oppressive conditions in the South through the Great Migration and faced struggles in new urban environments.\n\nAli believed that African Americans were all Moors, whom he claimed were descended from the ancient Moabites (describing them as belonging to Northwest Africa as opposed to Moab as the name suggests). He claimed that Islam and its teachings are more beneficial to their earthly salvation, and that their 'true nature' had been 'withheld' from them. In the traditions he founded, male members of the Temple wear a fez or turban as head covering; women wear a turban.\n\nThey added the suffixes Bey or El to their surnames, to signify Moorish heritage as well as their taking on the new life as Moorish Americans. It was also a way to claim and proclaim a new identity over that lost to the slavery of their ancestors. These suffixes were a clear sign to others that while one's African tribal name may never be known to him/her, acceptance of European names given by slave masters were not theirs, either.\n\nAs Drew Ali began his version of teaching the Moorish-Americans to become better citizens, he made speeches like, \"A Divine Warning By the Prophet for the Nations\", in which he urged them to reject derogatory labels, such as \"Black\", \"colored\", and \"Negro\". He urged Americans of all races to reject hate and embrace love. He believed that Chicago would become a second Mecca.\n\nThe ushers of the Temple wore black fezzes. The leader of a particular temple was known as a Grand Sheik, or Governor. Noble Drew Ali had several wives. According to the \"Chicago Defender\", he claimed the power to marry and divorce at will.\n\nIn 1913, Drew Ali formed the Canaanite Temple in Newark, New Jersey. He left the city after agitating people with his views on race. Drew Ali and his followers migrated, while planting congregations in Philadelphia; Washington, D.C., and Detroit. Finally, Drew Ali settled in Chicago in 1925, saying the Midwest was \"closer to Islam.\" The following year he officially registered Temple No. 9.\n\nThere he instructed followers not to be confrontational but to build up their people to be respected. In this way, they might take their place in the United States by developing a cultural identity that was congruent with Drew Ali's beliefs on personhood. In the late 1920s, journalists estimated the Moorish Science Temple had 35,000 members in 17 temples in cities across the Midwest and upper South. It was reportedly studied and watched by the Chicago police.\n\nBuilding Moorish-American businesses was part of their program, and in that was similar to Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League and the later Nation of Islam. By 1928, members of the Moorish Science Temple of America had obtained some respectability within Chicago and Illinois, as they were featured prominently and favorably in the pages of the \"Chicago Defender\", an African American newspaper, and conspicuously collaborated with African American politician and businessman Daniel Jackson.\n\nDrew Ali attended the January 1929 inauguration of Louis L. Emmerson, as 27th Governor of Illinois in the state capital of Springfield. The \"Chicago Defender\" stated that his trip included \"interviews with many distinguished citizens from Chicago, who greeted him on every hand.\" With the growth in its population and membership, Chicago was established as the center of the movement.\n\nIn early 1929, following a conflict over funds, Claude Green-Bey, the business manager of Chicago Temple No. 1 split from the Moorish Science Temple of America. He declared himself Grand Sheik and took a number of members with him. On March 15, Green-Bey was stabbed to death at the Unity Hall of the Moorish Science Temple, on Indiana Avenue in Chicago.\n\nDrew Ali was out of town at the time, as he was dealing with former Supreme Grand Governor Lomax Bey (professor Ezaldine Muhammad), who had supported Green-Bey's attempted coup. When Drew Ali returned to Chicago, the police arrested him and other members of the community on suspicion of having instigated the killing. No indictment was sworn for Drew Ali at that time.\n\nShortly after his release by the police, Drew Ali died at age 43 at his home in Chicago on July 20, 1929. Although the exact circumstances of his death are unknown, the Certificate of Death stated that Noble Drew Ali died from \"tuberculosis broncho-pneumonia\". Despite the official report, many of his followers speculated that his death was caused by injuries from the police or from other members of the faith. Others thought it was due to pneumonia. One Moor told the \"Chicago Defender\", \"The Prophet was not ill; his work was done and he laid his head upon the lap of one of his followers and passed out.\"\n\nThe death of Drew Ali brought out a number of candidates to succeed him. Brother Edward Mealy El stated that he had been declared Drew Ali's successor by Drew Ali himself. In August, within a month of Drew Ali's death, John Givens El, Drew Ali's chauffeur, declared that he was Drew Ali reincarnated. He is said to have fainted while working on Drew Ali's automobile and \"the sign of the star and crescent [appeared] in his eyes\".\n\nAt the September Unity Conference, Givens again made his claim of reincarnation. However, the governors of the Moorish Science Temple of America declared Charles Kirkman Bey to be the successor to Drew Ali and named him Grand Advisor.\n\nWith the support of several temples each, Mealy El and Givens El both went on to lead separate factions of the Moorish Science Temple. All three factions (Kirkman Bey, Mealy El, and Givens El) are active today.\n\nOn September 25, 1929, Kirkman Bey's wife reported to the Chicago police his apparent kidnapping by one Ira Johnson. Accompanied by two Moorish Science members, the police visited the home of Johnson, when they were met by gunfire. The attack escalated into a shoot-out that spilled into the surrounding neighborhood. In the end, a policeman as well as a member were killed in the gun battle, and a second policeman later died of his wounds. The police took 60 people into police custody, and a reported 1000 police officers patrolled the Chicago South Side that evening. Johnson and two others were later convicted of murder.\n\nKirkman Bey went on to serve as Grand Advisor of one of the most important factions until 1959, when the reins were given to F. Nelson-Bey.\n\nThe community was further split when Wallace Fard Muhammad, known within the temple as David Ford El, also claimed (or was taken by some) to be the reincarnation of Drew Ali. When his leadership was rejected, Ford El broke away from the Moorish Science Temple. He moved to Detroit, where he formed his own group, an organization that would become the Nation of Islam. The Nation of Islam denied any historical connection with the Moorish Science Temple until February 26, 2014, when Louis Farrakhan acknowledged the contribution(s) of Noble Drew Ali to the Nation of Islam and their founding principles.\n\nDespite the turmoil and defections, the movement continued to grow in the 1930s. It is estimated that membership in the 1930s reached 30,000. There were major congregations in Philadelphia, Detroit, and Chicago.\n\nOne-third of the members, or 10,000, lived in Chicago, the center of the movement. There were congregations in numerous other cities where African Americans had migrated in the early 20th century. The group published several magazines: one was the \"Moorish Guide National\". During the 1930s and 1940s, continued surveillance by police (and later the FBI) caused the Moors to become more withdrawn and critical of the government.\n\nDuring the 1940s, the Moorish Science Temple (specifically the Kirkman Bey faction) came to the attention of the FBI, who investigated claims of members committing subversive activities by adhering to and spreading of Japanese propaganda. The investigation failed to find any substantial evidence, and the investigations were dropped. The federal agency later investigated the organization in 1953 for violation of the Selective Service Act of 1948 and sedition. In September 1953, the Department of Justice determined that prosecution was not warranted for the alleged violations. The file that the FBI created on the temple grew to 3,117 pages during its lifetime. They never found any evidence of any connection or much sympathy of the temple's members for Japan.\n\nIn 1976 Jeff Fort, leader of Chicago's Black P Stone Nation, announced at his parole from prison in 1976 that he had converted to Islam. Moving to Milwaukee, Fort associated himself with the Moorish Science Temple of America. It is unclear whether he officially joined or was instead rejected by its members.\n\nIn 1978, Fort returned to Chicago and changed the name of his gang to \"El Rukn\" (\"the foundation\" in Arabic), also known as \"Circle Seven El Rukn Moorish Science Temple of America\" and the \"Moorish Science Temple, El Rukn tribe\". Scholars are divided over the nature of the relationship, if any, between \"El Rukn\" and the Moorish Science Temple of America. Fort reportedly hoped that an apparent affiliation with a religious organization would discourage law enforcement.\n\nIn 1984 the Chicago congregation bought a building from Buddhist monks in Ukrainian Village, which continues to be used for Temple No. 9. Demographic and cultural changes have decreased the attraction of young people to the Moorish Science Temple. Only about 200 members attended a convention in 2007, rather than the thousands of the past. In the early 2000s, the temples in Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, and Washington, D.C. had about 200 members each, and many were older people.\n\nAn increasing number of people claiming to follow Moorish Science have filed false legal documents in various municipalities around the United States. The documents include fake liens, deeds, and property claims. The Moorish Science Temple has disavowed any affiliation with those filing the false documents, calling them \"radical and subversive fringe groups\".\n\n\n"}

TAO facilitates research collaborations and the exchange of research materials by use of a Material Transfer Agreement or other types of technology transfer agreements between NIDDK and the global scientific community by developing research partnerships. Unlike most technology transfer and development offices, TAO also helps NIDDK inventors advance their technologies through preclinical development.\nTechnology transfer is the process by which basic science research and fundamental discoveries are developed into practical and commercially relevant applications and products. TAO is committed to transferring its technologies and research resources to external organizations for further research, development and/or commercialization to create biomedical products and services that benefit public health. TAO's staff members have been drawn from industry as well as other external organizations to provide a remarkable variety of skills to assist potential research partners. TAO staff evaluate and manage invention portfolios, oversee patent prosecution, negotiate licensing agreements and review cooperative research agreements.\n\nThe function of technology transfer is a process by which technology developed in one organization, in any one particular area and purpose, is applied in another organization, in another area, or for another purpose. Simply put, NIDDK TAO facilitates the movement of technology from the federal laboratories to industry and to state and local governments in order to maximize results of ongoing Federal research endeavors. \n\nThe Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 established the foundation for technology transfer within the Federal government. This law recognized the need for enhanced information dissemination from the Federal government to private industry. It also required Federal laboratories to take a more active role in cooperation with potential users of federally developed technology. \n\nBayh-Dole Act of 1980 gives federal contractors, grantees, and cooperative agreement funding recipients the option to retain ownership rights to inventions they create as part of a federally sponsored research project and profit from commercializing them. The act also protects the government’s interests by requiring that federal agencies and their authorized funding recipients retain a license to practice the invention for government purposes. It ultimately granted universities the clear right to pursue patents on government-funded research.\n\nThe Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 provides the legal basis for and encourages shared use of Government facilities and resources with the private sector to aid in the commercialization of new products and services. This act established the Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) which encourages such research and development and it gave organizations the option to license their product.\n\nThe goal of the NIDDK research is to expand the basic scientific knowledge pertaining to health. Scientists submit manuscripts pertaining to their advances and discoveries to a variety of professional publications. This assures distribution of taxpayer-funded research results. Occasionally the research yields a potential new therapeutic, preventative treatment, or diagnostic product. NIDDK technologies may be patented if this it facilitates or attracts investment by partners for further research and commercial development. A patent is particularly important if development requires approval of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nTAO encourages the development by industry for public use and benefit of inventions from technology resulting from NIDDK and collaborative research. One of TAO's important functions is to raise visibility of the Institutes inventions by seeking out possible partnerships to further commercial development in order to benefit public health. \n\nCommercialization is one of the most effective methods of transferring technologies. TAO assesses technical and marketing development, manufacturing requirements and financial feasibility in order to maximize a product’s or invention’s potential. TAO evaluates perceived need for the product, size of potential market, expected sales, advantages over competing products, and the cost of promoting the product. \n\nRoyalties are a form of income that is received by the inventor and the Institute as a result of a license granted to a collaborator to develop, manufacture or otherwise use or produce the invention for sale or distribution. The royalty rate, usually a percentage of sales of the invention, is negotiated as part of the license agreement between NIDDK and the licensee.\n\nNIDDK conducts and supports research on many chronic and costly diseases affecting public health: diabetes, obesity, nutrition, digestive disorders, endocrine and metabolic disorders, hematologic diseases, and kidney and urologic diseases, as well as complications from HIV infection. NIDDK’s biomedical research efforts could be generally characterized as “internal medicine”-oriented as they relate to the medical specialties of endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, infectious disease, and nephrology. NIDDK employs clinicians who conduct and manage clinical research studies on these various diseases. NIDDK employs medicinal chemists, who conduct research to synthesize and evaluate both macro-molecules and small molecules, including agonists and antagonists to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), Adenosine, and 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors. In addition, NIDDK employs biologists and process scientists who create a vast array of technologies ranging from cell lines to transgenic and knock-out mouse models. The biological modeling mathematicians generate new tools such as the Body Weight Simulator, an online tool for obesity researchers and weight management professionals to better understand how diet and exercise quantitatively contribute to weight loss and weight loss maintenance. \n\n"}

Narrative theory is a means by which we can comprehend how we impose order on our experiences and actions by giving them a narrative form. According to Walter Fisher, narratives are fundamental to communication and provide structure for human experience and influence people to share common explanations and understandings (58). Fisher defines narratives as “symbolic actions-words and/or deeds that have sequence and meaning for those who live, create, or interpret them.” Study of narrative criticism, therefore, includes form (fiction or non-fiction, prose or poetry), genre (myth, history, legend, etc.), structure (including plot, theme, irony, foreshadowing, etc.) characterization, and communicator’s perspective.\n\nCharacteristics of a narrative were defined as early as Aristotle in his \"Poetics\" under plot. He called plot as the “first principle” or the “soul of a tragedy.” According to him, plot is the arrangement of incidents that imitate the action with a beginning, middle, and end. Plot includes introduction of characters, rising action and introduction of complication, development of complication, climax (narrative), and final resolution. As described by White (1981) and Martin (1986), plot involves a structure of action. However, not all narratives contain a plot. Fragmentation occurs as the traditional plot disappears, narratives become less linear, and the burden of meaning making gets shifted from the narrator to the reader.\n\nNarratives can be found in a range of practices such as novels, short stories, plays, films, histories, documentaries, gossip, biographies, television and scholarly books. All of these artifacts make excellent objects for narrative criticism. When performing a narrative criticism, critics should focus on the features of the narrative that allow them to say something meaningful about the artifact.

{"id": "39565", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39565", "title": "Noble savage", "text": "Noble savage\n\nA noble savage is a literary stock character who embodies the concept of the indigene, outsider, wild human, an \"other\" who has not been \"corrupted\" by civilization, and therefore symbolizes humanity's innate goodness.\n\nIn English, the phrase first appeared in the 17th century in John Dryden's heroic play \"The Conquest of Granada\" (1672), wherein it was used in reference to newly created man. \"Savage\" at that time could mean \"wild beast\" as well as \"wild man\". The phrase later became identified with the idealized picture of \"nature's gentleman\", which was an aspect of 18th-century sentimentalism. The noble savage achieved prominence as an oxymoronic rhetorical device after 1851, when used sarcastically as the title for a satirical essay by English novelist Charles Dickens, who some believe may have wished to disassociate himself from what he viewed as the \"feminine\" sentimentality of 18th and early 19th-century romantic primitivism.\n\nThe idea that humans are essentially good is often attributed to the 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury, a Whig supporter of constitutional monarchy. In his \"Inquiry Concerning Virtue\" (1699), Shaftesbury had postulated that the moral sense in humans is natural and innate and based on feelings, rather than resulting from the indoctrination of a particular religion. Shaftesbury was reacting to Thomas Hobbes's justification of an absolutist central state in his \"Leviathan\", \"Chapter XIII\", in which Hobbes famously holds that the state of nature is a \"war of all against all\" in which men's lives are \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short\". Hobbes further calls the American Indians an example of a contemporary people living in such a state. Although writers since antiquity had described people living in pre-civilized conditions, Hobbes is credited with inventing the term \"State of Nature\". Ross Harrison writes that \"Hobbes seems to have invented this useful term.\"\n\nContrary to what is sometimes believed, Jean-Jacques Rousseau never used the phrase \"noble savage\" (French \"\"). However, the character of the \"noble savage\" appeared in French literature at least as early as Jacques Cartier (coloniser of Québec, speaking of the Iroquois) and Michel de Montaigne (philosopher, speaking of the Tupinamba) in the 16th century.\n\nTacitus' \"De origine et situ Germanorum\" (\"Germania\"), written 98 AD, has been described as a predecessor of the modern noble savage concept, which started in the 17th and 18th centuries in western European travel literature.\n\nDuring the late 16th and 17th centuries, the figure of the indigene or \"savage\"—and later, increasingly, the \"good savage\"—was held up as a reproach to European civilization, then in the throes of the French Wars of Religion and Thirty Years' War. During the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre (1572), some ten to twenty thousand men, women, and children were massacred by Catholic mobs, chiefly in Paris, but also throughout France. This horrifying breakdown of civil control was deeply disturbing to thoughtful people on both sides of the religious divide.\n\nIn his famous essay \"Of Cannibals\" (1580), Michel de Montaigne—himself a Catholic—reported that the Tupinambá people of Brazil ceremoniously eat the bodies of their dead enemies as a matter of honour. However, he reminded his readers that Europeans behave even more barbarously when they burn each other alive for disagreeing about religion (he implies): \"One calls 'barbarism' whatever he is not accustomed to.\"\n\nIn \"Of Cannibals\", Montaigne uses cultural (but not moral) relativism for the purpose of satire. His cannibals are neither noble nor especially good, but not worse than 16th-century Europeans. In this classical humanist view, customs differ but people everywhere are prone to cruelty, a quality that Montaigne detested.\n\nThe treatment of indigenous peoples by the Spanish Conquistadors also produced a great deal of bad conscience and recriminations. The Spanish priest Bartolomé de las Casas, who witnessed it, may have been the first to idealize the simple life of the indigenous Americans. He and other observers praised their simple manners and reported that they were incapable of lying.\n\nEuropean angst over colonialism inspired fictional treatments such as Aphra Behn's novel \"Oroonoko, or the Royal Slave\" (1688), about a slave revolt in Surinam in the West Indies. Behn's story was not primarily a protest against slavery; rather, it was written for money, and it met readers' expectations by following the conventions of the European romance novella. The leader of the revolt, Oroonoko, is truly noble in that he is a hereditary African prince, and he laments his lost African homeland in the traditional terms of a classical Golden Age. He is not a savage but dresses and behaves like a European aristocrat. Behn's story was adapted for the stage by Irish playwright Thomas Southerne, who stressed its sentimental aspects, and as time went on, it came to be seen as addressing the issues of slavery and colonialism, remaining very popular throughout the 18th century.\n\nIn English, the phrase \"Noble Savage\" first appeared in poet John Dryden's heroic play, \"The Conquest of Granada\" (1672):\n<poem>\nI am as free as nature first made man,\nEre the base laws of servitude began,\nWhen wild in woods the noble savage ran.</poem>\n\nThe hero who speaks these words in Dryden's play is here denying the right of a prince to put him to death, on the grounds that he is not that prince's subject. These lines were quoted by Scott as the heading to Chapter 22 of his \"A Legend of Montrose\" (1819). \"Savage\" is better taken here in the sense of \"wild beast\", so that the phrase \"noble savage\" is to be read as a witty conceit meaning simply the beast that is above the other beasts, or man.\n\nEthnomusicologist Ter Ellingson believes that Dryden had picked up the expression \"noble savage\" from a 1609 travelogue about Canada by the French explorer Marc Lescarbot, in which there was a chapter with the ironic heading: \"The Savages are Truly Noble\", meaning simply that they enjoyed the right to hunt game, a privilege in France granted only to hereditary aristocrats. It is not known if Lescarbot was aware of Montaigne's stigmatization of the aristocratic pastime of hunting, though some authors believe he was familiar with Montaigne. Lescarbot's familiarity with Montaigne, is discussed by Ter Ellingson in \"The Myth of the Noble Savage\".\n\nIn Dryden's day the word \"savage\" did not necessarily have the connotations of cruelty now associated with it. Instead, as an adjective, it could as easily mean \"wild\", as in a wild flower, for example. Thus he wrote in 1697, 'the savage cherry grows. ...';.\n\nOne scholar, Audrey Smedley, believes that: \"English conceptions of 'the savage' were grounded in expansionist conflicts with Irish pastoralists and more broadly, in isolation from, and denigration of neighboring European peoples.\" and Ellingson agrees that \"The ethnographic literature lends considerable support for such arguments\"\n\nIn France the stock figure that in English is called the \"noble savage\" has always been simply \"le bon sauvage\", \"the good wild man\", a term without any of the paradoxical frisson of the English one. Montaigne is generally credited for being at the origin of this myth in his Essays (1580), especially \"Of Coaches\" and \"Of Cannibals\". This character, an idealized portrayal of \"Nature's Gentleman\", was an aspect of 18th-century sentimentalism, along with other stock characters such as, the Virtuous Milkmaid, the Servant-More-Clever-than-the-Master (such as Sancho Panza and Figaro, among countless others), and the general theme of virtue in the lowly born. The use of stock characters (especially in theater) to express moral truths derives from classical antiquity and goes back to Theophrastus's \"Characters\", a work that enjoyed a great vogue in the 17th and 18th centuries and was translated by Jean de La Bruyère. The practice largely died out with advent of 19th-century realism but lasted much longer in genre literature, such as adventure stories, Westerns, and, arguably, science fiction. Nature's Gentleman, whether European-born or exotic, takes his place in this cast of characters, along with the Wise Egyptian, Persian, and Chinaman. \"But now, alongside the Good Savage, the Wise Egyptian claims his place.\" Some of these types are discussed by Paul Hazard in \"The European Mind\".\n\nHe had always existed, from the time of the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\", where he appears as Enkiddu, the wild-but-good man who lives with animals. Another instance is the untutored-but-noble medieval knight, Parsifal. The Biblical shepherd boy David falls into this category. The association of virtue with withdrawal from society—and specifically from cities—was a familiar theme in religious literature.\n\n\"Hayy ibn Yaqdhan\" an Islamic philosophical tale (or thought experiment) by Ibn Tufail from 12th-century Andalusia, straddles the divide between the religious and the secular. The tale is of interest because it was known to the New England Puritan divine, Cotton Mather. Translated into English (from Latin) in 1686 and 1708, it tells the story of Hayy, a wild child, raised by a gazelle, without human contact, on a deserted island in the Indian Ocean. Purely through the use of his reason, Hayy goes through all the gradations of knowledge before emerging into human society, where he revealed to be a believer of natural religion, which Cotton Mather, as a Christian Divine, identified with Primitive Christianity. The figure of Hayy is both a Natural man and a Wise Persian, but not a Noble Savage.\n\nThe \"locus classicus\" of the 18th-century portrayal of the American Indian are the famous lines from Alexander Pope's \"Essay on Man\" (1734):\n\n<poem>Lo, the poor Indian! whose untutor'd mind\nSees God in clouds, or hears him in the wind;\nHis soul proud Science never taught to stray\nFar as the solar walk or milky way;\nYet simple Nature to his hope has giv'n,\nBehind the cloud-topp'd hill, a humbler heav'n;\nSome safer world in depth of woods embrac'd,\nSome happier island in the wat'ry waste,\nWhere slaves once more their native land behold,\nNo fiends torment, no Christians thirst for gold!\nTo be, contents his natural desire;\nHe asks no angel's wing, no seraph's fire:\nBut thinks, admitted to that equal sky,\nHis faithful dog shall bear him company.\"</poem>\n\nTo Pope, writing in 1734, the Indian was a purely abstract figure— \"poor\" either meant ironically, or applied because he was uneducated and a heathen, but also happy because he was living close to Nature. This view reflects the typical Age of Reason belief that men are everywhere and in all times the same as well as a Deistic conception of natural religion (although Pope, like Dryden, was Catholic). Pope's phrase, \"Lo the Poor Indian\", became almost as famous as Dryden's \"noble savage\" and, in the 19th century, when more people began to have first hand knowledge of and conflict with the Indians, would be used derisively for similar sarcastic effect.\n\nIn the 1st century AD, sterling qualities such as those enumerated above by Fénelon (excepting perhaps belief in the brotherhood of man) had been attributed by Tacitus in his \"Germania\" to the German barbarians, in pointed contrast to the softened, Romanized Gauls. By inference Tacitus was criticizing his own Roman culture for getting away from its roots—which was the perennial function of such comparisons. Tacitus's Germans did not inhabit a \"Golden Age\" of ease but were tough and inured to hardship, qualities which he saw as preferable to the decadent softness of civilized life. In antiquity this form of \"hard primitivism\", whether admired or deplored (both attitudes were common), co-existed in rhetorical opposition to the \"soft primitivism\" of visions of a lost Golden Age of ease and plenty.\n\nAs art historian Erwin Panofsky explains:\n\nIn the 18th century the debates about primitivism centered around the examples of the people of Scotland as often as the American Indians. The rude ways of the Highlanders were often scorned, but their toughness also called forth a degree of admiration among \"hard\" primitivists, just as that of the Spartans and the Germans had done in antiquity. One Scottish writer described his Highland countrymen this way:\n\nDebates about \"soft\" and \"hard\" primitivism intensified with the publication in 1651 of Hobbes's \"Leviathan\" (or \"Commonwealth\"), a justification of absolute monarchy. Hobbes, a \"hard Primitivist\", flatly asserted that life in a state of nature was \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short\"—a \"war of all against all\":\n\nReacting to the wars of religion of his own time and the previous century, he maintained that the absolute rule of a king was the only possible alternative to the otherwise inevitable violence and disorder of civil war. Hobbes' hard primitivism may have been as venerable as the tradition of soft primitivism, but his use of it was new. He used it to argue that the state was founded on a social contract in which men voluntarily gave up their liberty in return for the peace and security provided by total surrender to an absolute ruler, whose legitimacy stemmed from the Social Contract and not from God.\n\nHobbes' vision of the natural depravity of man inspired fervent disagreement among those who opposed absolute government. His most influential and effective opponent in the last decade of the 17th century was Shaftesbury. Shaftesbury countered that, contrary to Hobbes, humans in a state of nature were neither good nor bad, but that they possessed a moral sense based on the emotion of sympathy, and that this emotion was the source and foundation of human goodness and benevolence. Like his contemporaries (all of whom who were educated by reading classical authors such as Livy, Cicero, and Horace), Shaftesbury admired the simplicity of life of classical antiquity. He urged a would-be author “to search for that simplicity of manners, and innocence of behavior, which has been often known among mere savages; ere they were corrupted by our commerce” (\"Advice to an Author\", Part III.iii). Shaftesbury's denial of the innate depravity of man was taken up by contemporaries such as the popular Irish essayist Richard Steele (1672–1729), who attributed the corruption of contemporary manners to false education. Influenced by Shaftesbury and his followers, 18th-century readers, particularly in England, were swept up by the cult of Sensibility that grew up around Shaftesbury's concepts of sympathy and benevolence.\n\nMeanwhile, in France, where those who criticized government or Church authority could be imprisoned without trial or hope of appeal, primitivism was used primarily as a way to protest the repressive rule of Louis XIV and XV, while avoiding censorship. Thus, in the beginning of the 18th century, a French travel writer, the Baron de Lahontan, who had actually lived among the Huron Indians, put potentially dangerously radical Deist and egalitarian arguments in the mouth of a Canadian Indian, Adario, who was perhaps the most striking and significant figure of the \"good\" (or \"noble\") savage, as we understand it now, to make his appearance on the historical stage:\n\nPublished in Holland, Lahontan's writings, with their controversial attacks on established religion and social customs, were immensely popular. Over twenty editions were issued between 1703 and 1741, including editions in French, English, Dutch and German.\n\nMany of the most incendiary passages in Raynal's book, one of the bestsellers of the eighteenth century, especially in the Western Hemisphere, are now known to have been in fact written by Diderot. Reviewing Jonathan Israel's \"Democratic Enlightenment: Philosophy, Revolution, and Human Rights\", Jeremy Jennings, notes that \"The History of the Two Indies\", in the opinion of Jonathan Israel, was the text that \"made a world revolution\" by delivering \"the most devastating single blow to the existing order\":\n\nIn the later 18th century, the published voyages of Captain James Cook and Louis Antoine de Bougainville seemed to open a glimpse into an unspoiled Edenic culture that still existed in the un-Christianized South Seas. Their popularity inspired Diderot's \"Supplement to the Voyage of Bougainville\" (1772), a scathing critique of European sexual hypocrisy and colonial exploitation.\n\nBenjamin Franklin, who had negotiated with the Indians during the French and Indian War, protested vehemently against the Paxton massacre that took place at Conestoga, in western Pennsylvania, of December 1763, in which white vigilantes massacred Indian women and children, many of whom had converted to Christianity. Franklin himself personally organized a Quaker militia to control the white population and \"strengthen the government\". In his pamphlet \"Remarks Concerning the Savages of North America\" (1784), Franklin deplored the use of the term \"savages\" for Native Americans:\n\nFranklin used the massacres to illustrate his point that no race had a monopoly on virtue, likening the Paxton vigilantes to \"Christian White Savages'\". Franklin cried out to a just God to punish those who carried the Bible in one hand and the hatchet in the other: 'O ye unhappy Perpetrators of this Horrid Wickedness!'\" Franklin praised the Indian way of life, their customs of hospitality, their councils, which reached agreement by discussion and consensus, and noted that many white men had voluntarily given up the purported advantages of civilization to live among them, but that the opposite was rare.\n\nThough retrospectively it may seem to us that Franklin may have idealized the Indians to make a rhetorical point, the phrase \"noble savage\" never appears in his writings.\n\nJean-Jacques Rousseau, like Shaftesbury, also insisted that man was born with the potential for goodness; and he, too, argued that civilization, with its envy and self-consciousness, has made men bad. In his \"Discourse on the Origins of Inequality Among Men\" (1754), Rousseau maintained that man in a State of Nature had been a solitary, ape-like creature, who was not \"méchant\" (bad), as Hobbes had maintained, but (like some other animals) had an \"innate repugnance to see others of his kind suffer\" (and this natural sympathy constituted the Natural Man's one-and-only natural virtue). It was Rousseau's fellow \"philosophe\", Voltaire, objecting to Rousseau's egalitarianism, who charged him with primitivism and accused him of wanting to make people go back and walk on all fours. Because Rousseau was the preferred philosopher of the radical Jacobins of the French Revolution, he, above all, became tarred with the accusation of promoting the notion of the \"noble savage\", especially during the polemics about Imperialism and scientific racism in the last half of the 19th century. Yet the phrase \"noble savage\" does not occur in any of Rousseau's writings. In fact, Rousseau arguably shared Hobbes' pessimistic view of humankind, except that as Rousseau saw it, Hobbes had made the error of assigning it to too early a stage in human evolution. According to the historian of ideas, Arthur O. Lovejoy:\n\nIn his \"Discourse on the Origins of Inequality\", Rousseau, anticipating the language of Darwin, states that as the animal-like human species increased there arose a \"formidable struggle for existence\" between it and other species for food. It was then, under the pressure of necessity, that \"le caractère spécifique de l'espèce humaine\"—the specific quality that distinguished man from the beasts—emerged—intelligence, a power, meager at first but yet capable of an \"almost unlimited development\". Rousseau calls this power the \"faculté de se perfectionner\"—perfectibility. Man invented tools, discovered fire, and in short, began to emerge from the state of nature. Yet at this stage, men also began to compare himself to others: \"It is easy to see. ... that all our labors are directed upon two objects only, namely, for oneself, the commodities of life, and consideration on the part of others.\" \"Amour propre\"—the desire for consideration (self regard), Rousseau calls a \"factitious feeling arising, only in society, which leads a man to think more highly of himself than of any other.\" This passion began to show itself with the first moment of human self-consciousness, which was also that of the first step of human progress: \"It is this desire for reputation, honors, and preferment which devours us all ... this rage to be distinguished, that we own what is best and worst in men—our virtues and our vices, our sciences and our errors, our conquerors and our philosophers—in short, a vast number of evil things and a small number of good.\" It is this \"which inspires men to all the evils which they inflict upon one another.\". To be sure, Rousseau praises the newly discovered \"savage\" tribes (whom Rousseau does \"not\" consider in a \"state of nature\"), as living a life that is simpler and more egalitarian than that of the Europeans; and he sometimes praises this \"third stage\" it in terms that could be confused with the romantic primitivism fashionable in his times. He also identifies ancient primitive communism under a patriarchy, such as he believes characterized the \"youth\" of mankind, as perhaps the happiest state and perhaps also illustrative of how man was intended by God to live. But these stages are not all good, but rather are mixtures of good and bad. According to Lovejoy, Rousseau's basic view of human nature after the emergence of social living is basically identical to that of Hobbes. Moreover, Rousseau does not believe that it is possible or desirable to go back to a primitive state. It is only by acting together in civil society and binding themselves to its laws that men become men; and only a properly constituted society and reformed system of education could make men good. According to Lovejoy:\n\nFor Rousseau the remedy was not in going back to the primitive but in reorganizing society on the basis of a properly drawn up social compact, so as to \"draw from the very evil from which we suffer [i.e., civilization and progress] the remedy which shall cure it.\" Lovejoy concludes that Rousseau's doctrine, as expressed in his \"Discourse on Inequality\":\n\nDuring the 19th century the idea that men were everywhere and always the same that had characterized both classical antiquity and the Enlightenment was exchanged for a more organic and dynamic evolutionary concept of human history. Advances in technology now made the indigenous man and his simpler way of life appear, not only inferior, but also, even his defenders agreed, foredoomed by the inexorable advance of progress to inevitable extinction. The sentimentalized \"primitive\" ceased to figure as a moral reproach to the decadence of the effete European, as in previous centuries. Instead, the argument shifted to a discussion of whether his demise should be considered a desirable or regrettable eventuality. As the century progressed, native peoples and their traditions increasingly became a foil serving to highlight the accomplishments of Europe and the expansion of the European Imperial powers, who justified their policies on the basis of a presumed racial and cultural superiority.\n\nIn 1853 Charles Dickens wrote a scathingly sarcastic review in his weekly magazine \"Household Words\" of painter George Catlin's show of American Indians when it visited England. In his essay, entitled \"The Noble Savage\", Dickens expressed repugnance for Indians and their way of life in no uncertain terms, recommending that they ought to be “civilised off the face of the earth”. (Dickens's essay refers back to Dryden's well-known use of the term, not to Rousseau.) Dickens's scorn for those unnamed individuals, who, like Catlin, he alleged, misguidedly exalted the so-called \"noble savage\", was limitless. In reality, Dickens maintained, Indians were dirty, cruel, and constantly fighting among themselves. Dickens's satire on Catlin and others like him who might find something to admire in the American Indians or African bushmen is a notable turning point in the history of the use of the phrase.\n\nLike others who would henceforth write about the topic, Dickens begins by disclaiming a belief in the \"noble savage\":\n\nDickens' essay was arguably a pose of manly, no-nonsense realism and a defense of Christianity. At the end of it his tone becomes more recognizably humanitarian, as he maintains that, although the virtues of the savage are mythical and his way of life inferior and doomed, he still deserves to be treated no differently than if he were an Englishman of genius, such as Newton or Shakespeare:\n\nAlthough Charles Dickens had ridiculed positive depictions of Native Americans as portrayals of so-called \"noble\" savages, he made an exception (at least initially) in the case of the Inuit, whom he called “loving children of the north”, “forever happy with their lot,” “whether they are hungry or full”, and “gentle loving savages”, who, despite a tendency to steal, have a “quiet, amiable character” (\"Our Phantom Ship on an Antediluvian Cruise\", \"Household Words\", April 16, 1851). However he soon reversed this rosy assessment, when on October 23, 1854, \"The Times\" of London published a report by explorer-physician John Rae of the discovery by Eskimos of the remains of the lost Franklin expedition along with unmistakable evidence of cannibalism among members of the party:\n\nFranklin's widow and other surviving relatives and indeed the nation as a whole were shocked to the core and refused to accept these reports, which appeared to undermine the whole assumption of the cultural superiority of the heroic white explorer-scientist and the imperial project generally. Instead, they attacked the reliability of the Eskimos who had made the gruesome discovery and called them liars. An editorial in \"The Times\" called for further investigation:\n\nThis line was energetically taken up by Dickens, who wrote in his weekly magazine:\n\nDr. John Rae rebutted Dickens in two articles in \"Household Words\": “The Lost Arctic Voyagers”, \"Household Words\", No. 248 (December 23, 1854), and \"Dr. Rae’s Report to the Secretary of the Admiralty\", \"Household Words\", No. 249 (December 30, 1854). Though he did not call them noble, Dr. Rae, who had lived among the Inuit, defended them as “dutiful” and “a bright example to the most civilized people”, comparing them favorably with the undisciplined crew of the Franklin expedition, whom he suggested were ill-treated and \"would have mutinied under privation\", and moreover with the lower classes in England or Scotland generally.\n\nDickens and Wilkie Collins subsequently collaborated on a melodramatic play, \"The Frozen Deep\", about the menace of cannibalism in the far north, in which \"the villainous role assigned to the Eskimos in \"Household Words\" is assumed by a working class Scotswoman.\n\n\"The Frozen Deep\" was performed as a benefit organized by Dickens and attended by Queen Victoria, Prince Albert, and Emperor Leopold II of Belgium, among others, to fund a memorial to the Franklin Expedition. (Dr. Rae himself was Scots).\n\nRae's respect for the Inuit and his refusal to scapegoat them in the Franklin affair arguably harmed his career. Lady Franklin's campaign to glorify the dead of her husband's expedition, aided and abetted by Dickens, resulted in his being more or less shunned by the British establishment. Although it was not Franklin but Rae who in 1848 discovered the last link in the much-sought-after Northwest Passage, Rae was never awarded a knighthood and died in obscurity in London. (In comparison fellow Scot and contemporary explorer David Livingstone was knighted and buried with full imperial honors in Westminster Abbey). However, modern historians have confirmed Rae's discovery of the Northwest Passage and the accuracy of his report on cannibalism among Franklin's crew. Canadian author Ken McGoogan, a specialist on Arctic exploration, states that Rae's willingness to learn and adopt the ways of indigenous Arctic peoples made him stand out as the foremost specialist of his time in cold-climate survival and travel. Rae's respect for Inuit customs, traditions, and skills was contrary to the prejudiced belief of many 19th-century Europeans that native peoples had no valuable technical knowledge or information to impart.\n\nIn July 2004, Orkney and Shetland MP Alistair Carmichael introduced into the UK Parliament a motion proposing that the House \"regrets that Dr Rae was never awarded the public recognition that was his due\". In March 2009 Carmichael introduced a further motion urging Parliament to formally state it \"regrets that memorials to Sir John Franklin outside the Admiralty headquarters and inside Westminster Abbey still inaccurately describe Franklin as the first to discover the [North West] passage, and calls on the Ministry of Defence and the Abbey authorities to take the necessary steps to clarify the true position.\"\n\nDickens's racism, like that of many Englishmen, became markedly worse after the Sepoy Rebellion of 1857 in India.\n\nIt was said that Dickens's racism, “grew progressively more illiberal over the course of his career\". Grace Moore, on the other hand, argues that Dickens, a staunch abolitionist and opponent of imperialism, had views on racial matters that were a good deal more complex than previous critics have suggested. This event, and the virtually contemporaneous occurrence of the American Civil War (1861–1864), which threatened to, and then did, put an end to slavery, coincided with a polarization of attitudes exemplified by the phenomenon of scientific racism.\n\nIn 1860, John Crawfurd and James Hunt mounted a defense of British imperialism based on \"scientific racism\". Crawfurd, in alliance with Hunt, took over the presidency of the Ethnological Society of London, which was an offshoot of the Aborigines' Protection Society, founded with the mission to defend indigenous peoples against slavery and colonial exploitation. Invoking \"science\" and \"realism\", the two men derided their \"philanthropic\" predecessors for believing in human equality and for not recognizing that mankind was divided into superior and inferior races. Crawfurd, who opposed Darwinian evolution, \"denied any unity to mankind, insisting on immutable, hereditary, and timeless differences in racial character, principal amongst which was the 'very great' difference in 'intellectual capacity.'\" For Crawfurd, the races had been created separately and were different species. Crawfurd was Scots, and thought the Scots \"race\" superior to all others; whilst Hunt, on the other hand, believed in the supremacy of the Anglo-Saxon \"race\". Crawfurd and Hunt routinely accused those who disagreed with them of believing in \"Rousseau's Noble Savage\". The pair ultimately quarreled because Hunt believed in slavery and Crawfurd did not. \"As Ter Ellingson demonstrates, Crawfurd was responsible for re-introducing the Pre-Rousseauian concept of 'the Noble Savage' to modern anthropology, attributing it wrongly and quite deliberately to Rousseau.”. In an otherwise rather lukewarm review of Ellingson's book in \"Journal of Colonialism and Colonial History\" 4:1 (Spring 2003), Frederick E. Hoxie writes:\n\n\"If Rousseau was not the inventor of the Noble Savage, who was?\" writes Ellingson,\n\nEllingson finds that any remotely positive portrayal of an indigenous (or working class) person is apt to be characterized (out of context) as a supposedly \"unrealistic\" or \"romanticized\" \"Noble Savage\". He points out that Fairchild even includes as an example of a supposed \"Noble Savage\", a picture of a Negro slave on his knees, lamenting lost his freedom. According to Ellingson, Fairchild ends his book with a denunciation of the (always unnamed) believers in primitivism or \"The Noble Savage\"—who, he feels, are threatening to unleash the dark forces of irrationality on civilization.\n\nEllingson argues that the term \"noble savage\", an oxymoron, is a derogatory one, which those who oppose \"soft\" or romantic primitivism use to discredit (and intimidate) their supposed opponents, whose romantic beliefs they feel are somehow threatening to civilization. Ellingson maintains that virtually none of those accused of believing in the \"noble savage\" ever actually did so. He likens the practice of accusing anthropologists (and other writers and artists) of belief in the noble savage to a secularized version of the inquisition, and he maintains that modern anthropologists have internalized these accusations to the point where they feel they have to begin by ritualistically disavowing any belief in \"noble savage\" if they wish to attain credibility in their fields. He notes that text books with a painting of a handsome Native American (such as the one by Benjamin West on this page) are even given to school children with the cautionary caption, \"A painting of a Noble Savage\". West's depiction is characterized as a typical \"noble savage\" by art historian Vivien Green Fryd, but her interpretation has been contested.\n\nThe most famous modern example of \"hard\" (or anti-) primitivism in books and movies was William Golding's \"Lord of the Flies\", published in 1954. The title is said to be a reference to the Biblical devil, Beelzebub. This book, in which a group of school boys stranded on a desert island \"revert\" to savage behavior, was a staple of high school and college required reading lists during the Cold War.\n\nIn the 1970s, film director Stanley Kubrick professed his opposition to primitivism. Like Dickens, he began with a disclaimer:\n\nThe opening scene of Kubrick's movie \"\" (1968) depicted prehistoric ape-like men wielding weapons of war, as the tools that supposedly lifted them out of their animal state and made them human.\n\nAnother opponent of primitivism is the Australian anthropologist Roger Sandall, who has accused other anthropologists of exalting the \"noble savage\". A third is archeologist Lawrence H. Keeley, who has criticised a \"widespread myth\" that \"civilized humans have fallen from grace from a simple primeval happiness, a peaceful golden age\" by uncovering archeological evidence that he claims demonstrates that violence prevailed in the earliest human societies. Keeley argues that the \"noble savage\" paradigm has warped anthropological literature to political ends.\n\nThe noble savage is described as having a natural existence. The term ignoble savage has an obvious negative connotation. The ignoble savage is detested—described as having a cruel and primitive existence. Often, the phrase “ignoble savage” was used and abused to justify colonialism. The concept of the ignoble savage gave Europeans the \"right\" to establish colonies without considering the possibility of preexisting, functional societies. A prime example would be the use of the Discovery Doctrine which is still used in the courts of the United States of America.\n\nThe \"noble savage\" often maps to uncorrupted races in science fiction and fantasy genres, often deliberately as a contrast to \"fallen\" more advanced cultures, in films such as \"Avatar\" and literature including Ghân-buri-Ghân in \"The Lord of the Rings\".\nTwo very famous noble savage characters in fantasy and science fiction that are very well known are Tarzan created by Edgar Rice Burroughs and Conan The Barbarian created by Robert E. Howard. Ka-Zar, Thongor and such are lesser known. Tarzan and Conan are not only known through their literature, but by movie adaptations and other licensed material.\n\nAccording to critics like the \"Telegraph\"'s Tim Robey, romantically idealized portrayals of non-industrialized or exotic people persist in popular films, as for example in \"The Lone Ranger\" or \"Dances with Wolves\".\n\n\nConcepts:\n\nCultural examples:\n\n"}

According to the English Orientalist Godfrey Rolles Driver, the term \"Kurd\" is related to the Sumerian \"Karda\" which was found from Sumerian clay tablets of the third millennium B.C, while according to other scholars, it predates the Islamic period, as a Middle Persian word for \"nomad\", and may ultimately be derived from an ancient toponym or tribal name, either that of the \"Cyrtii\" or of \"Corduene\". The name \"Kurds\" (Arabic \"Kurd\", plural \"Akrad\") is used throughout the medieval period, from the Islamic conquests, also as a generic term for Iranian nomadic tribes by the Arabs.\n\nThere are different theories about the origin of name \"Kurd\". According to one theory, it originates in Middle Persian as 𐭪𐭥𐭫𐭲 \"kwrt-\", a term for \"nomad; tent-dweller\".\nAfter the Muslim conquest of Persia, this term is adopted into Arabic as \"kurd-\", and was used specifically of nomadic tribes.\n\nAs for the Middle Persian noun \"kwrt-\" originating in an ancient toponym, it has been argued that it may ultimately reflect a Bronze Age toponym \"Qardu\", \"Kar-da\", which may also be reflected in the Arabic (Quranic) toponym\n\"Ǧūdī\" (re-adopted in Kurdish as \"Cûdî\")\nThe name would be continued in classical antiquity as the first element in the toponym \"Corduene\", and its inhabitants, mentioned by Xenophon as the tribe of the \"Carduchoi\" who opposed the retreat of the Ten Thousand through the mountains north of Mesopotamia in the 4th century BC. This view is supported by some recent academic sources which have considered Corduene as proto-Kurdish region. Alternatively, \"kwrt-\" may be a derivation from the name of the \"Cyrtii\" tribe instead.\n\nAccording to some sources, by the 16th century, there seems to develop an ethnic identity designated by the term \"Kurd\" among various Northwestern Iranian groups, without reference to any specific Iranian language.\n\nKurdish scholar Mehrdad Izady argues that any nomadic groups called \"kurd\" in medieval Arabic are \"bona fide ethnic Kurds\", and that it is conversely the non-Kurdish groups descended from them who have \"acquired separate ethnic identities since the end of the medieval period\".\n\nSherefxan Bidlisi in the 16th century states that there are four division of \"Kurds\": \"Kurmanj\", \"Lur\", \"Kalhor\" and \"Guran\", each of which speak a different dialect or language variation. Paul (2008) notes that the 16th-century usage of the term \"Kurd\" as recorded by Bidlisi, regardless of linguistic grouping, might still reflect an incipient Northwestern Iranian \"Kurdish\" ethnic identity uniting the Kurmanj, Kalhor, and Guran.\n\nThe term \"kurd\" is used in the 16th century by Sherefxan Bidlisi as encompassing four \ntribal groups, the \"Kurmanj\", \"Lur\", \"Kalhor\" and \"Guran\", each of which speak a different dialect or language variation. \nPaul (2008) argues that this marks an incipient ethnogenesis of the Kurds as a coherent Northwestern Iranian group, as three out of these four groups can be identified as the ancestors of groups that at least partially identify as Kurdish today, while the \"Lurs\" are not a Kurdish group, and indeed do not belong to the Northwest Iranian but to the Southwestern Iranian linguistic phylum.\nPaul further notes that the first texts that identifiably are written in Kurdish appear during the same period.\n\nThe Kurdish people are believed to be of heterogeneous origins combining a number of earlier tribal or ethnic groups \nincluding Lullubi, Guti, Cyrtians, Carduchi.\n\nSome of them have also absorbed some elements from Semitic, \nTurkic \nand Armenian people.\n\nWhile various predecessor groups that may have contributed to Kurdish ethnogenesis are of intractable antiquity (the Gutians being a people of the Middle Bronze Age), the emergence of the Kurds as speakers of an identifiably Northwestern Iranian language (viz. Kurdish) necessarily post-dates the unity of the Northwestern branch.\n\n19th-century scholars, such as George Rawlinson, identified Corduene and Carduchi with the modern Kurds, considering that \"Carduchi\" was the ancient lexical equivalent of \"Kurdistan\". \nThis view is supported by some recent academic sources which have considered Corduene as proto-Kurdish or as equivalent to modern-day Kurdistan.\n\nThere were numerous forms of this name, partly due to the difficulty of representing \"kh\" in Latin. The spelling \"Karduchoi\" is itself probably borrowed from Armenian, since the termination \"-choi\" represents the Armenian language plural suffix \"-kh\".\nIt is speculated that Carduchi spoke an Old Iranian language.\n\nJewish sources trace origins of people of Corduene to marriage of Jinns of King Solomon with 500 beautiful Jewish women. The same legend was also used by the early Islamic authorities to explain origins of Kurds.\n\nGershevitch and Fisher consider the independent Kardouchoi or Carduchi as the ancestors of the Kurds, or at least the original nucleus of the Iranian-speaking people in what is now Kurdistan.\n\nThe Medes have often been believed to be a starting point for Kurdish (as well as Baloch) ethnogesis. This would leave about a millennium of separate development between the collapse of the Median Empire and the first historical mention of the Kurds as an identifiable ethnic group.\n\nThe Median hypothesis was advanced by Vladimir Minorsky . \nI. Gershevitch who provided first \"a piece of linguistic confirmation\" of Minorsky's identification and then another \"sociolinguistic\" argument.\nGernot Windfuhr (1975) identified Kurdish dialects as Parthian, albeit with a Median substratum.\n\nMedian descent of the Kurds has found favour as a historical narrative among Kurds in the 20th century, so that identification of Kurds as Medes is now common in Kurdish nationalist sentiment, though some experts believe it is incorrect.\n\nThe hypothesis is not without its detractors, among them Martin van Bruinessen (2004).\nAsatrian (2009) stated that \"The Central Iranian dialects, and primarily those of the Kashan area in the first place, as well as the Azari dialects (otherwise called Southern Tati) are probably the only Iranian dialects, which can pretend to be the direct offshoots of Median ... In general, the relationship between Kurdish and Median are not closer than the affinities between the latter and other North Western dialects — Baluchi, Talishi, South Caspian, Zaza, Gurani, etc.\"\n\nThere are multiple legends that detail the origins of the Kurds. One details the Kurds as being the descendants of King Solomon’s angelic servants (Djinn). These were sent to Europe to bring him five-hundred beautiful maidens, for the king's harem. However, when these had done so and returned to Israel the king had already died. As such, the Djinn settled in the mountains, married the women themselves, and their offspring came to be known as the Kurds.\n\nAdditionally, in the legend of Newroz, an evil Assyrian king named Zahak, who had two snakes growing out of his shoulders, had conquered Iran, and terrorized its subjects; demanding daily sacrifices in the form of young men's brains. Unknowingly to Zahak, the cooks of the palace saved one of the men, and mixed the brains of the other with those of a sheep. The men that were saved were told to flee to the mountains. Hereafter, Kaveh the Blacksmith, who had already lost several of his children to Zahak, trained the men in the mountains, and stormed Zahak’s palace, severing the heads of the snakes and killing the tyrannical king. Kaveh was instilled as the new king, and his followers formed the beginning of the Kurdish people.\n\nIn the writings of the Ottoman Turkish traveller Evliya Çelebi, there's also a legend concerning the Kurds to be found. He states to have learned of this legend from a certain \"Mighdisî\", an Armenian historian:\n\n"}
{"id": "180339", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=180339", "title": "Ostinato", "text": "Ostinato\n\nIn music, an ostinato (derived from Italian: \"stubborn\", compare English, from Latin: 'obstinate') is a motif or phrase that persistently repeats in the same musical voice, frequently in the same pitch. Well-known ostinato-based pieces include both classical compositions such as Ravel's \"Boléro\" and popular songs such as Donna Summer and Giorgio Moroder's \"I Feel Love\" (1977), Henry Mancini's theme from \"Peter Gunn\" (1959), The Verve's \"Bitter Sweet Symphony\" (1997), and April Ivy's \"Be Ok\" (1997).\n\nIn RCM (Royal Conservatory of Music), a level 8 theory definition for the term \"ostinato\" would be referred to as \"a recurring rhythmic or melodic pattern\". The repeating idea may be a rhythmic pattern, part of a tune, or a complete melody in itself. Both \"ostinatos\" and \"ostinati\" are accepted English plural forms, the latter reflecting the word's Italian etymology. Strictly speaking, ostinati should have exact repetition, but in common usage, the term covers repetition with variation and development, such as the alteration of an ostinato line to fit changing harmonies or keys. \n\nWithin the context of film music, Claudia Gorbman defines an \"ostinato\" as a repeated melodic or rhythmic figure that propels scenes that lack dynamic visual action.\n\nOstinato plays an important part in improvised music (rock and jazz), in which it is often referred to as a \"riff\" or a \"vamp\". A \"favorite technique of contemporary jazz writers\", ostinati are often used in modal and Latin jazz and traditional African music including Gnawa music.\n\nThe term \"ostinato\" has essentially the same meaning as the medieval Latin word \"pes\", the word \"ground\" as applied to classical music, and the word \"riff\" in contemporary popular music.\n\n\"Ostinati\" are used in 20th-century music to stabilize groups of pitches, as in Stravinsky's \"The Rite of Spring\" \"Introduction\" and \"Augurs of Spring\". A famous type of ostinato, called the \"Rossini crescendo\", owes its name to a crescendo that underlies a persistent musical pattern, which usually culminates in a solo vocal cadenza. This style was emulated by other bel canto composers, especially Vincenzo Bellini; and later by Wagner (in pure instrumental terms, discarding the closing vocal cadenza).\n\nApplicable in homophonic and contrapuntal textures they are \"repetitive rhythmic-harmonic schemes\", more familiar as accompanimental melodies, or purely rhythmic. The technique's appeal to composers from Debussy to avant-garde composers until at least the 1970s \"... lies in part in the need for unity created by the virtual abandonment of functional chord progressions to shape phrases and define tonality\". Similarly, in modal music, \"... relentless, repetitive character help to establish and confirm the modal center\". Their popularity may also be justified by their ease as well as range of use, though, \"... ostinato must be employed judiciously, as its overuse can quickly lead to monotony\".\n\nOstinato patterns have been present in European music from the Middle Ages onwards. In the famous English canon \"Sumer Is Icumen In\", the main vocal lines are underpinned by an ostinato pattern, known as a \"pes\":]\n\nLater in the medieval era, Dufay’s 15th century chanson \"Resvelons Nous\" features a similarly constructed ostinato pattern, but this time 5 bars long. Over this, the main melodic line moves freely, varying the phrase-lengths, while being “to some extent predetermined by the repeating pattern of the canon in the lower two voices.” ]\n\n\"Ground bass\" or \"basso ostinato\" (obstinate bass) is a type of variation form in which a bass line, or harmonic pattern (see Chaconne; also common in Elizabethan England as \"Grounde\") is repeated as the basis of a piece underneath variations. Aaron Copland describes basso ostinato as \"... the easiest to recognize\" of the variation forms wherein, \"... a long phrase—either an accompanimental figure or an actual melody—is repeated over and over again in the bass part, while the upper parts proceed normally [with variation]\". However, he cautions, \"it might more properly be termed a musical device than a musical form.\"\n\nOne striking ostinato instrumental piece of the late Renaissance period is “The Bells”, a piece for virginals by William Byrd. Here the ostinato (or ‘ground’) consists of just two notes:\n\nIn Italy, during the seventeenth century, Claudio Monteverdi composed many pieces using ostinato patterns in his operas and sacred works. One of these was his 1650 version of “Laetatus sum”, an imposing setting of Psalm 122 that pits a four note “ostinato of unquenchable energy.” against both voices and instruments:]\n\nLater in the same century, Henry Purcell became famous for his skilful deployment of ground bass patterns. His most famous ostinato is the descending chromatic ground bass that underpins the Lament at the end of his opera \"Dido and Aeneas\": While the use of a descending chromatic scale to express pathos was fairly common at the end of the seventeenth century, Richard Taruskin points out that Purcell shows a fresh approach to this musical trope: “Altogether unconventional and characteristic, however, is the interpolation of an additional cadential measure into the stereotyped ground, increasing its length from a routine four to a haunting five bars, against which the vocal line, with its despondent refrain (‘Remember me!’), is deployed with marked asymmetry. That, plus Purcell’s distinctively dissonant, suspension-saturated harmony, enhanced by additional chromatic descents during the final ritornello and by many deceptive cadences, makes this little aria an unforgettably poignant embodiment of heartache.” See also: Lament bass.\n\nHowever, this is not the only ostinato pattern that Purcell uses in the opera. Dido’s opening aria “Ah, Belinda” is a further demonstration of Purcell’s technical mastery: the phrases of the vocal line do not always coincide with the 4-bar ground:]\n\n“Purcell’s compositions over a ground vary in their working out, and the repetition never becomes a restriction.” Purcell’s instrumental music also featured ground patterns. A particularly fine and complex example is his Fantasia upon a Ground for three violins and continuo: ]\n\nThe intervals in the above pattern are found in many works of the Baroque Period. \"Pachelbel's Canon\" also uses a similar sequence of notes in the bass part: \n\nTwo pieces by J.S.Bach are particularly striking for their use of an ostinato bass: the Crucifixus from his Mass in B minor and the Passacaglia in C minor for organ, which has a ground rich in melodic intervals: The first variation that Bach builds over this ostinato consists of a gently syncopated motif in the upper voices: This characteristic rhythmic pattern continues in the second variation, but with some engaging harmonic subtleties, especially in the second bar, where an unexpected chord creates a passing implication of a related key: In common with other Passacaglias of the era, the ostinato is not simply confined to the bass, but rises to the uppermost part later in the piece: A performance of the entire piece can be heard here.\n\nOstinatos feature in many works of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Mozart uses an ostinato phrase throughout the big scene that ends Act 2 of the \"Marriage of Figaro\", to convey a sense of suspense as the jealous Count Almaviva tries in vain to incriminate the Countess, his wife, and Figaro, his butler, for plotting behind his back. A famous type of ostinato, called the Rossini crescendo, owes its name to a crescendo that underlies a persistent musical pattern, which usually culminates in a solo vocal cadenza.\n\nIn the energetic Scherzo of Beethoven’s late C sharp minor Quartet, Op. 131, there is a harmonically static passage, with “the repetitiveness of a nursery rhyme” that consists of an ostinato shared between viola and cello supporting a melody in octaves in the first and second violins: Beethoven reverses this relationship a few bars later with the melody in the viola and cello and the ostinato shared between the violins:\n\nBoth the first and third acts of Wagner’s final opera \"Parsifal\" feature a passage accompanying a scene where a band of Knights solemnly processes from the depths of forest to the hall of the Grail. The “Transformation music” that supports this change of scene is dominated by the iterated tolling of four bells:] Brahms used ostinato patterns in both the finale of his Fourth Symphony and in the closing section of his \"Variations on a Theme by Haydn\": ]\n\nDebussy featured an ostinato pattern throughout his Piano Prelude “Des pas sur la Neige”. Here, the ostinato pattern stays in the middle register of the piano – it is never used as a bass. “Remark that the footfall ostinato remains nearly throughout on the same notes, at the same pitch level... this piece is an appeal to the basic loneliness of all human beings, oft-forgotten perhaps, but, like the ostinato, forming a basic undercurrent of our history.” ] Of all the major classical composers of the Twentieth Century, Stravinsky is possibly the one most associated with the practice of ostinato. In conversation with the composer, his friend and colleague Robert Craft remarked “Your music always has an element of repetition, of ostinato. What is the function of ostinato?” Stravinsky replied; “It is static – that is, anti-development; and sometimes we need a contradiction to development.” Stravinsky was particularly skilled at using ostinatos to confound rather than confirm rhythmic expectations. In the first of his \"Three Pieces for String Quartet\", Stravinsky sets up three repeated patterns, which overlap one another and never coincide. \"Here a rigid pattern of (3+2+2/4) bars is laid over a strictly recurring twenty-three-beat tune (the bars being marked by a cello ostinato), so that their changing relationship is governed primarily by the pre-compositional scheme.\" “The rhythmical current running through the music is what binds together these curious mosaic-like pieces.”\n\nA subtler metrical conflict can be found in the final section of Stravinsky’s \"Symphony of Psalms\". The choir sing a melody in triple time, while the bass instruments in the orchestra play a 4-beat ostinato against this. “This is built up over an ostinato bass (harp, two pianos and timpani) moving in fourths like a pendulum.\"\n\nMany instruments south of the Sahara Desert play ostinato melodies. These include lamellophones such as the mbira, as well as xylophones like the balafon, the bikutsi, and the gyil. Ostinato figures are also played on string instruments such as the kora, gankoqui bell ensembles, and pitched drums ensembles. Often, African ostinatos contain offbeats or cross-beats, that contradict the metric structure. Other African ostinatos generate complete cross-rhythms by sounding both the main beats and cross-beats. In the following example, a gyil sounds the three-against-two cross-rhythm (hemiola). The left hand (lower notes) sounds the two main beats, while the right hand (upper notes) sounds the three cross-beats.\n\nPopular dance bands in West Africa and the Congo region feature ostinato playing guitars. The African guitar parts have drawn from a variety of sources, including the indigenous mbira, as well as foreign influences such as James Brown-type funk riffs. However, the foreign influences are interpreted through a distinctly African ostinato sensibility. African guitar styles began with Congolese bands doing Cuban \"cover\" songs. The Cuban guajeo had a both familiar and exotic quality to the African musicians. Gradually, various regional guitar styles emerged, as indigenous influences became increasingly dominant within these \"Africanized guajeos\".\n\nAs Moore states, \"One could say that I – IV – V – IV [chord progressions] is to African music what the 12-bar blues is to North American music.\" Such progressions seem superficially to follow the conventions of Western music theory. However, performers of African popular music do not perceive these progressions in the same way. Harmonic progressions which move from the tonic to the subdominant (as they are known in European music) have been used in Traditional sub-Saharan African harmony for hundreds of years. Their elaborations follow all the conventions of traditional African harmonic principles. Gehard Kubik concludes:\n\nThe harmonic cycle of C–F–G–F [I–IV–V–IV] prominent in Congo/Zaire popular music simply cannot be defined as a progression from tonic to subdominant to dominant and back to subdominant (on which it ends) because in the performer's appreciation they are of equal status, and not in any hierarchical order as in Western music—(Kubik 1999).\n\nA guajeo is a typical Cuban ostinato melody, most often consisting of arpeggiated chords in syncopated patterns. The guajeo is a hybrid of the African and European ostinato. The guajeo was first played as accompaniment on the tres in the folkloric changüí and son. The term \"guajeo\" is often used to mean specific ostinato patterns played by a tres, piano, an instrument of the violin family, or saxophones. The guajeo is a fundamental component of modern-day salsa, and Latin jazz. The following example shows a basic guajeo pattern.\n\nThe guajeo is a seamless Afro-Euro ostinato hybrid, which has had a major influence upon jazz, R&B, rock 'n' roll and popular music in general. The Beatles' \"I Feel Fine\" guitar riff is guajeo-like.\n\nIn various popular music styles, \"riff\" refers to a brief, relaxed phrase repeated over changing melodies. It may serve as a refrain or melodic figure, often played by the rhythm section instruments or solo instruments that form the basis or accompaniment of a musical composition. Though they are most often found in rock music, heavy metal music, Latin, funk and jazz, classical music is also sometimes based on a simple riff, such as Ravel's Boléro. Riffs can be as simple as a tenor saxophone honking a simple, catchy rhythmic figure, or as complex as the riff-based variations in the head arrangements played by the Count Basie Orchestra.\n\nDavid Brackett (1999) defines riffs as, \"short melodic phrases\", while Richard Middleton (1999) defines them as \"short rhythmic, melodic, or harmonic figures repeated to form a structural framework\". Rikky Rooksby states, \"A riff is a short, repeated, memorable musical phrase, often pitched low on the guitar, which focuses much of the energy and excitement of a rock song.\"\n\nBBC Radio 2, in compiling its list of 100 Greatest Guitar Riffs, defined a riff as, \"The main hook of a song and must be played principally by a guitar. It often begins the song, but is repeated throughout it, giving the song its distinctive voice.\"\n\nThe term \"riff\" entered musical slang in the 1920s, and is used primarily in discussion of forms of rock music or jazz. \"Most rock musicians use \"riff\" as a near-synonym for \"musical idea.\"\" The etymology of the term is not clearly known. Some sources explain \"riff\" as an abbreviation for \"rhythmic figure\" or \"refrain\". Charlie Parker's 1945 recording \"Thriving From a Riff\" may have popularized the term.\n\nUse of the term has extended to comedy, where \"riffing\" means the verbal exploration of a particular subject, thus moving the meaning away from the original jazz sense of a repeated figure that a soloist improvises over, to instead indicate the improvisation itself—improvising on a melody or progression as one would improvise on a subject by extending a singular thought, idea or inspiration into a \"bit\", or \"routine\".\n\nIn jazz and R&B, riffs are often used as the starting point for longer compositions. The \"Night Train\" riff was first used in Duke Ellington's \"Happy-Go-Lucky Local\", which Ellington recycled from Johnny Hodges' earlier \"That's the Blues, Old Man\".\n\nThe riff from Charlie Parker's bebop number \"Now's the Time\" (1945) re-emerged four years later as the R&B dance hit \"The Hucklebuck\". The verse of \"The Hucklebuck\"—another riff—was \"borrowed\" from the Artie Matthews composition \"Weary Blues\". Glenn Miller's \"In the Mood\" had an earlier life as Wingy Manone's \"Tar Paper Stomp\". All these songs use twelve bar blues riffs, and most of these riffs probably precede the examples given.\n\nNeither of the terms 'riff' or 'lick' are used in classical music. Instead, individual musical phrases used as the basis of classical music pieces are called ostinatos or simply phrases. Contemporary jazz writers also use riff- or lick-like ostinatos in modal music. Latin jazz often uses guajeo-based riffs.\n\nThe term 'riff driven' describes a piece of music that relies on a repeated instrumental riff as the basis of its most prominent \"melody\", \"cadence\", or (in some cases) \"leitmotif\". Riff-driven songs are largely a product of jazz, blues, and post-blues era music (rock and pop). The musical goal of riff-driven songs is akin to the classical \"continuo\" effect, but raised to much higher importance (in fact, the repeated riff is used to anchor the song in the ears of the listener). The riff/continuo is brought to the forefront of the musical piece and often is the primary melody that remains in the listener's ears. A \"call and response\" often holds the song together, creating a \"circular\" rather than linear feel.\n\nA few examples of riff-driven songs are \"Whole Lotta Love\" and \"Black Dog\" by Led Zeppelin, \"Day Tripper\", and \"I Feel Fine\" by The Beatles, \"Brown Sugar\" and \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\" by The Rolling Stones, \"One Vision\" and \"Hammer to Fall\" by Queen, \"Outshined\" by Soundgarden, \"Enter Sandman\" by Metallica, \"Smoke on the Water\" by Deep Purple, \"Holy Wars...The Punishment Due\" by Megadeth, \"Mind Games\" by John Lennon, \"Message in a Bottle\" by The Police, \"The Trooper\" by Iron Maiden, \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\" by Iron Butterfly and \"Into the Void\" by Black Sabbath.\n\nIn music, a \"vamp\" is a repeating musical figure, section, or accompaniment used in blues, jazz, gospel, soul, and musical theater. Vamps are also found in rock, funk, reggae, R&B, pop, country, and post-sixties jazz. Vamps are usually harmonically sparse: A vamp may consist of a single chord or a sequence of chords played in a repeated rhythm. The term frequently appeared in the instruction 'Vamp till ready' on sheet music for popular songs in the 1930s and 1940s, indicating the accompanist should repeat the musical phrase until the vocalist was ready. Vamps are generally symmetrical, self-contained, and open to variation. The equivalent in classical music is an ostinato, in hip hop and electronic music is the loop and in rock music is the riff.\n\nThe slang term \"vamp\" comes from the Middle English word \"vampe\" (sock), from Old French \"avanpie\", equivalent to Modern French \"avant-pied\", literally \"before-foot\".\n\nMany vamp-oriented songwriters begin the creative process by attempting to evoke a mood or feeling while riffing freely on an instrument or scat singing. Many well known artists primarily build songs with a vamp/riff/ostinato based approach—including John Lee Hooker (\"Boogie Chillen\", \"House Rent Boogie\"), Bo Diddley (\"Hey Bo Diddley\", \"Who Do You Love?\"), Jimmy Page (\"Ramble On\", \"Bron Yr Aur\"), Nine Inch Nails (\"Closer\"), and Beck (\"Loser\").\n\nClassic examples of vamps in jazz include \"A Night in Tunisia\", \"Take Five\", \"A Love Supreme\", \"Maiden Voyage\", and \"Cantaloupe Island\". Rock examples include the long jam at the ends of \"Loose Change\" by Neil Young and Crazy Horse and \"Sooner or Later\" by King's X.\n\nIn jazz, fusion, and related genres, a background vamp provides a performer with a harmonic framework supporting improvisation. In Latin jazz guajeos fulfill the role of piano vamp. A vamp at the beginning of a jazz tune may act as a springboard to the main tune; a vamp at the end of a song is often called a \"tag\".\n\n\"Take Five\" begins with a repeated, syncopated figure in time, which pianist Dave Brubeck plays throughout the song (except for Joe Morello's drum solo and a variation on the chords in the middle section).\n\nThe music from Miles Davis's modal period (1958–1963) was based on improvising songs with a small number of chords. The jazz standard \"So What\" uses a vamp in the two-note \"Sooooo what?\" figure, regularly played by the piano and the trumpet throughout. Jazz scholar Barry Kernfeld calls this music \"vamp music\".\n\nExamples include the outros to George Benson's \"Body Talk\" and \"Plum\", and the solo changes to \"Breezin'\". The following songs are dominated by vamps: John Coltrane, Kenny Burrell, and Grant Green's versions of \"My Favorite Things\", Herbie Hancock's \"Watermelon Man\" and \"Chameleon\", Wes Montgomery's \"Bumpin' on Sunset\", and Larry Carlton's \"Room 335\".\n\nThe Afro-Cuban vamp style known as guajeo is used in the bebop/Latin jazz standard \"A Night in Tunisia\". Depending upon the musician, a repeating figure in \"A Night in Tunisia\" could be called an \"ostinato\", \"guajeo\", \"riff\", or \"vamp\". The Cuban-jazz hybrid spans the disciplines that encompass all these terms.\n\nIn gospel and soul music, the band often vamps on a simple ostinato groove at the end of a song, usually over a single chord. In soul music, the end of recorded songs often contains a display of vocal effects—such as rapid scales, arpeggios, and improvised passages. For recordings, sound engineers gradually fade out the vamp section at the end of a song, to transition to the next track on the album. Salsoul singers such as Loleatta Holloway have become notable for their vocal improvisations at the end of songs, and they are sampled and used in other songs. Andrae Crouch extended the use of vamps in gospel, introducing chain vamps (one vamp after the other, each successive vamp drawn from the first).\n\n1970s-era funk music often takes a short one or two bar musical figure based on a single chord one would consider an introduction vamp in jazz or soul music, and then uses this vamp as the basis of the entire song (\"Funky Drummer\" by James Brown, for example). Jazz, blues, and rock are almost always based on chord progressions (a sequence of changing chords), and they use the changing harmony to build tension and sustain listener interest. Unlike these music genres, funk is based on the rhythmic groove of the percussion, rhythm section instruments, and a deep electric bass line, usually all over a single chord. \"In funk, harmony is often second to the 'lock,' the linking of contrapuntal parts that are played on guitar, bass, and drums in the repeating vamp.\"\n\nExamples include Stevie Wonder's vamp-based \"Superstition\" and Little Johnny Taylor's \"Part Time Love\", which features an extended improvisation over a two-chord vamp.\n\nIn musical theater, a vamp, or intro, is the few bars, one to eight, of music without lyrics that begin a printed copy of a song. The orchestra may repeat the vamp or other accompaniment during dialogue or stage business, as accompaniment for onstage transitions of indeterminate length. The score provides a one or two bar vamp figure, and indicates, \"Vamp till cue\", by the conductor. The vamp gives the onstage singers time to prepare for the song or the next verse, without requiring the music to pause. Once the vamp section is over, the music continues to the next section.\n\nThe vamp may be written by the composer of the song, a copyist employed by the publisher, or the arranger for the vocalist. The vamp serves three main purposes: it provides the key, establishes the tempo, and provides emotional context. The vamp may be as short as a \"bell tone\", \"sting\" (a harmonized bell tone with stress on the starting note), or measures long. The \"rideout\" is the transitional music that begins on the downbeat of the last word of the song and is usually two to four bars long, though it may be as short as a sting or as long as a Roxy Rideout.\n\nIn Indian classical music, during Tabla or Pakhawaj solo performances and Kathak dance accompaniments, a conceptually similar melodic pattern known as the Lehara (sometimes spelled Lehra) or Nagma is played repeatedly throughout the performance. This melodic pattern is set to the number of beats in a rhythmic cycle (Tala or Taal) being performed and may be based on one or a blend of multiple Ragas.\n\nThe basic idea of the lehara is to provide a steady melodious framework and keep the time-cycle for rhythmic improvisations. It serves as an auditory workbench not only for the soloist but also for the audience to appreciate the ingenuity of the improvisations and thus the merits of the overall performance. In Indian Classical Music, the concept of 'sam' (pronounced as 'sum') carries paramount importance. The sam is the target unison beat (and almost always the first beat) of any rhythmic cycle. The second most important beat is the Khali, which is a complement of the sam. Besides these two prominent beats, there are other beats of emphasis in any given taal, which signify 'khand's (divisions) of the taal. E.g. 'Roopak' or 'Rupak' taal, a 7-beat rhythmic cycle, is divided 3–2–2, further implying that the 1st, 4th, and 6th beats are the prominent beats in that taal. Therefore, it is customary, but not essential, to align the lehara according to the divisions of the Taal. It is done with a view to emphasize those beats that mark the divisions of the Taal.\n\nThe lehara can be played on a variety of instruments, including the sarangi, harmonium, sitar, sarod, flute and others. The playing of the lehara is relatively free from the numerous rules and constraints of \"Raga Sangeet\", which are upheld and honoured in the tradition of Indian Classical Music. The lehara may be interspersed with short and occasional improvisations built around the basic melody. It is also permissible to switch between two or more disparate melodies during the course of the performance. It is essential that the lehara be played with the highest precision in Laya (Tempo) and Swara control, which requires years of specialist training (\"Taalim\") and practice (\"Riyaaz\"). It is considered a hallmark of excellence to play lehara alongside a recognised Tabla or Pakhawaj virtuoso as it is a difficult task to keep a steady pulse while the percussionist is improvising or playing difficult compositions in counterpoint. While there may be scores of individually talented instrumentalists, there are very few who are capable of playing the lehra for a Tabla / Pakhawaj solo performance.\n\n\n"}

According to Herbs co-founder Dilworth Karaka, it is a phrase UB40 came up with.\n\nPacific reggae differs from Jamaican reggae in the use of instruments such as the ukulele, traditional wooden drums, and keyboard synthesizers. Reggae in the Pacific is not typically Rastafarian; in the Pacific Islands, songs are often remakes of traditional songs e.g. Small Axe's remake of \"Kalipolina\". New Zealand reggae has Māori influences.\n\nNotable Pacific reggae groups include Herbs, who originally played a more Jamaican reggae style. They were subsequently encouraged by Bob Marley when he toured New Zealand in 1979, to explore and develop the Pacific reggae sound.\n\nOther notable Reggae groups include Three Houses Down, BrownHill, Kolohe Kai, Rebel Souljahz and artists such as Fiji Veikoso, Swiss and Majic\n"}

The cinema, which uses a 360-degree projector to surround viewers with a panoramic image, has 308 seats.\n\nThe OMNIMAX cinema has been part of the cultural center since the complex first opened in 1982. In October of that year, it premiered the film \"El pueblo del sol\", which was made especially for the cinema's opening. The film presents images from the most representative regions of Mexico, and got very good reviews. It was the cinema's only film for 13 years. Today, the center offers a daily selection of films; it premieres about four films per year.\nThe center encompasses a large esplanade that accommodates up to 6,000 people. The esplanade is a venue for performances, festivals, and expos.\n\nThere is also permanent exhibition, called \"Museo de las Californias\", which stores over 200 pieces and is a walk through the history of the Baja Peninsula and the state of California from the prehistoric period until the first half of the 20th century. Also a pre-Hispanic garden, called \"Jardin Caracol (Snail Garden)\", that contains sculptures from the different regions of the mesoamerican cultures that inhabited south Mexico before the arrival of the Spanish Army.

Toga parties are recorded in the yearbooks for Theta Delta Chi (1952) and the University of Michigan's Acacia fraternity (1953).
